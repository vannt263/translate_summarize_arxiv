    "although these systems differ in their details , e.g. in their roughness exponent @xmath37 , they do not yield qualitatively different behaviour in their dynamical response studied here .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop an approach based on the renormalization group ( rg ) to study the low temperature dynamics of pinned elastic systems described by ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "although we focus on equilibrium dynamics , some of our considerations are also relevant for non - equilibrium relaxation .",
    "it was shown that to describe the statics at equilibrium one needs to follow the full correlator of the random potential ( or the random force ) using a functional rg ( frg ) method in a @xmath38 expansion.@xcite several extensions describe correlated disorder,@xcite the driven dynamics near depinning @xcite and the small applied force , thermally activated , creep regime.@xcite however until now the frg has not been used to study the dynamical response and correlations in equilibrium or aging regimes , nor to probe the crucial question of the distribution of the relaxation times .",
    "these are important quantities directly probed in experiments where the system is often dominated by fluctuations or not able to reach equilibrium within the experimental time scales .",
    "we investigate this problem in three stages , of increasing accuracy ( and , unfortunately , complexity ) , only in the last stage attempt is made to be exhaustive . a companion paper ( ref .  )",
    "is devoted to the statics .",
    "a short account of both works can be found in ref .  .",
    "some of the present considerations concerning approximate schemes have also been discussed independently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first question investigated in the present paper is the validity of the single time scale approximation within the rg .",
    "specifically , in the first part of our study ( section ii ) we use , as was done in previous works,@xcite the simplifying hypothesis that the relaxation of each internal mode , of wavevector @xmath1 , is controlled by a single relaxation time scale @xmath0 .",
    "this allows to obtain closed equations , within the one loop frg , for the general two time response and correlations , as measured in aging experiments .",
    "it yields , in the equilibrium regime on which focus from then on , interesting analytical expressions for the equilibrium response and correlation which exhibit two distinct scaling regimes with scaling variables @xmath39 and @xmath3 , respectively ( @xmath40 is the energy fluctuation exponent , and @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , several features of these results are found to be unsatisfactory , such as the non - monotonicity of the response as a function of wavevector .",
    "a more complete description including time scale fluctuations thus appears necessary .",
    "that sample to sample fluctuations should play an important role both in the statics and dynamics of disordered glasses is indeed expected from phenomenological arguments , e.g. the droplet scenario,@xcite which appears to describe simpler models such as ( [ eq : ham ] ) relatively well , at least in low dimensions.@xcite let us recall its main conclusions . in its simplest form ,",
    "it supposes the existence , at each length scale @xmath7 , of a small number of excitations of size @xmath41 above a ground state , drawn from an energy distribution of width @xmath42 with constant weight near @xmath43 . while typically the elastic manifold is localized near a ground state , disorder averages of static thermal fluctuations at a given scale are dominated by rare samples / regions with two nearly degenerate minima",
    "for example , as a simple but remarkable consequence , the @xmath44 moment of @xmath45 fluctuations is expected to behave as @xmath46 the droplet picture supposes that the long - time equilibrium dynamics is dominated by thermal activation between these quasi - degenerate minima controlled by barriers of typical scale @xmath47 .",
    "little is known about the distribution of these barriers , but there is some evidence @xcite that @xmath48 .",
    "even a modest distribution of barriers , however , due to the arrhenius law @xmath49 , yields relaxation time scales with an extremely broad distribution as @xmath50 .",
    "some probes of this broad distribution are the relaxation time moments which may be defined in a variety of ways .",
    "one begins by defining the relaxation time moments in a single sample , @xmath51 which , for a particular disorder realization , describe the response of the center of mass coordinate to a ( spatially ) uniform force . for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 )",
    "this gives one definition of the relaxation time of a single sample .",
    "a set of disorder - averaged moments may be obtained then by directly averaging the above objects , @xmath54 , giving the averaged response of the system : @xmath55 alternatively , the _ distribution _ ( from sample to sample ) of the unaveraged relaxation time @xmath53 is described by a second set of moments , @xmath56 . in general , one may construct many such objects scaling dimensionally as @xmath57 but with different physical content .",
    "mathematically , this is accomplished by averaging arbitrary products of the single sample moments , i.e. @xmath58 , with @xmath59 .",
    "any of these `` @xmath60-th '' moments may behave as @xmath61 with @xmath62 , or grow even faster with @xmath63 , nor is it clear that the different definitions for a given @xmath60 exhibit the same growth .",
    "indeed , we will ultimately find different operators in a dynamical field theoretic formulation corresponding to each different type of moment , and some indications that indeed different growth rates obtain for each of these .",
    "a theory of these timescales is crucial to understanding both equilibrium response and correlations and to near - equilibrium phenomena such as creep.@xcite extensive calculations are possible in certain zero dimensional toy models.@xcite although some analytical results have been obtained for @xmath64 within mean - field limits,@xcite these do not include thermal activation over divergent barriers ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the frg @xcite on the other hand , extended to non - zero temperature , @xcite seems to capture , already at the level of the single time scale approximation the existence of these growing barriers .",
    "however until now neither the rare events nor fluctuating barriers have been obtained in this approach .    in the main part of our study ( sections iii and iv )",
    "we thus investigate how relaxation time distributions appear within the frg .",
    "we first show that the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) generates under coarse graining a _ random friction _",
    "term @xmath66 ( equivalently a random relaxation time @xmath67 ) .",
    "it is then natural to define , as a toy model , a random friction model which , in the absence of pinning disorder possesses a manifold of fixed points indexed by the full coarse grained probability distribution of the friction .",
    "a highly non - trivial question is how this distribution will flow under rg due to feedback from non - linear terms when pinning disorder is reintroduced .",
    "we consider this question at the one loop level , in two stages .    in section iii",
    "we present a highly simplified analysis , but with the merit of explicitly exhibiting the broadening of the barrier distribution and allowing for some analytical expressions .",
    "it yields asymptotically a log - normal distribution of relaxation times , i.e. a nearly gaussian distribution of effective barriers centered around @xmath8 and of typical fluctuations @xmath68 .",
    "such a log - normal tail corresponds to the moment exponents @xmath69 .",
    "this is compared with numerical results @xcite in the case of a directed polymer , where the width was fitted to @xmath70 .",
    "the question of the width is important since a width @xmath68 is not expected to be large enough to modify the creep exponent , as can be seen from reexamining the calculations of ref .",
    ", @xcite while a @xmath71 width @xcite would pose a problem to this order .",
    "we derive , within the same approximate scheme ( appendix  [ general ] ) , closed equations for correlations and response functions ( the fact that the width grows very fast can be exploited in a resummation of the fastest growing terms in the dynamical part of the martin siggia rose functional ) .",
    "we find that the broadening is sufficiently fast to invalidate some of the previous analysis , e.g. the existence of a @xmath3 scaling regime ) .",
    "section iv contains the full systematic analysis of the running dynamical effective action .",
    "it is found that relaxation times distributions are determined by a closed hierarchy of frg equations , each level @xmath11 corresponding to an increasing power of frequency @xmath12 can be solved independently of higher ones , the lowest one being the statics @xmath13 .",
    "this hierarchy involves functions parameterizing the local cross correlations between pinning disorder and random relaxation times .",
    "the previous approximation corresponds to projecting these frg functions to their values at zero , while in fact the full set of non - linear differential equations obeyed by these functions need to be solved , a formidably complex task .",
    "a thermal boundary layer ansatz ( tbla ) appears as a consistent solution .",
    "it extends the one discovered in the statics which was shown to reproduce droplet theory type behaviour in thermal fluctuations . here",
    "it yields a natural growth for moments of relaxation times measured by non - trivial exponents @xmath72 determined by eigenvalue problems . although perturbative control remains a challenge , the structure of the dynamical tbla which encodes for barrier distributions opens the way for deeper understanding of the field theory approach to glasses .",
    "the detailed outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : onetime ]",
    "we recall the standard results of the frg for the equilibrium dynamics using a single relaxation time approach .",
    "we then give a qualitative derivation of the two scaling regimes for the equilibrium response and correlation functions .",
    "the detailed equations obeyed by these functions are derived using a wilson scheme in appendix [ sec : onetimedetails ] and their analytical form is analyzed in the equilibrium regime in appendix [ sec : onetimedetails ] and in the aging regime in appendix  [ sec : onetimedetails2 ] . in section [ sec : fterm ] we go beyond the single relaxation time approach .",
    "the random friction model is introduced in section [ sec : rf ] .",
    "we then incorporate pinning disorder in an approximate way in section [ pinningdisorder ] , analyze the resulting distribution of relaxation times and show that it become broad .",
    "the breakdown of the @xmath73 scaling is analyzed in section [ breakdown ] . in section",
    "[ sec : fullstructure ] we discuss the systematics of the structure of the dynamical effective action .",
    "it does contain the statics which its recalled , together with its thermal boundary layer ansatz solution , in its equilibrium dynamics formulation in section  [ sec : staticstbla ] .",
    "then in section  [ sec : dynamicstbla]-[sec : terms - assoc - with ] we display the hierarchical structure of the frg equations and how a generalized thermal boundary later structure appears as a consistent solution determining the growth of the moments of the relaxation times through non - trivial eigenvalue problems .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] with some general remarks . finally , a set of appendices elaborate on various details and calculated related to the main text .",
    "at conventional pure critical points , scaling emerges directly from the existence of a rg fixed point .",
    "moreover , in an epsilon expansion , the _ scaling functions _ are obtained to leading order by a simple matching procedure ( ref ) .",
    "static _ equilibrium frg for the random elastic problem is , aside from the complication of a functional fixed point , very similar to such an ordinary rg calculation .",
    "the important distinction is the non - analyticity of the @xmath74 fixed point function @xmath75 which at finite temperature results in a narrow boundary layer for small @xmath76 , whose width continuously decreases under the frg as the running effective temperature @xmath77 ( see below ) flows to zero .",
    "the corresponding growth of the mean - squared curvature of the effective potential felt by the manifold is a hint of unconventional behavior not present in ordinary critical theories .",
    "the influence of this divergence is very dramatic in the dynamics . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to naively extend the conventional rg approach to calculating response functions to the random manifold problem .",
    "this conventional approach implicitly assumes the existence of a single time - scale ( at a given wavevector ) , as we shall soon see .",
    "this assumption leads to somewhat unsatisfactory results for the response function , forcing us to reconsider the distribution of time - scales in section  [ sec : fterm ] .",
    "although we will ultimately conclude that the single time - scale calculation is fundamentally incorrect , it is useful to review the methodology of this approach .",
    "we begin by reviewing the basics of the frg .",
    "we employ the martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) formalism,@xcite in order to use field - theoretic techniques .",
    "the msr approach is based on the generating functional @xmath78 $ ] for the disorder - averaged correlation and response functions , @xmath79   =   \\int du d\\hat{u } e^{- s[u,\\hat{u } ] + \\int_{r t } \\hat{h}_{rt } u_{rt } + h_{rt } i \\hat{u}_{rt } } , \\label{zdef}\\ ] ] where the dynamics in ( [ eom ] ) is encoded in the action @xmath80",

    "as justified below we have set @xmath84 .",
    "we use the ito convention to regularize equal - time response functions , i.e. @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the disorder averaged response and correlations are given by @xmath87    the frg in its wilsonian formulation begins by introducing an ultraviolet ( short distance ) cut - off @xmath28 on the spatial fourier wavevectors . in the frg , this cut - off is progressively reduced to @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . at each stage of the rg ,",
    "the spatial fourier components of @xmath90 are divided into `` slow '' and `` fast '' modes , with momenta in the range @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the fast modes are then integrated out , working perturbatively in @xmath93 to one loop order , and @xmath94 is increased by @xmath95 .",
    "this leads , in the limit of infinitesimal rescaling @xmath96 , to a smooth renormalization of the effective action for the remaining slow modes , and hence to continuous frg equations for the running disorder correlator @xmath97 .",
    "naive power counting ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) indicates that all terms beyond those in ( [ msr1])-([msr2 ] ) are irrelevant , so we for the moment neglect their generation under the frg .",
    "the flow of the random pinning correlator @xmath97 has been derived many times previously .@xcite it is better expressed in terms of the dimensionless rescaled pinning force correlator @xmath98 defined such that : @xmath99 with @xmath100 , and reads : @xmath101 here the fluctuation dissipation theorem ensures that the temperature @xmath102 is uncorrected but the effective dimensionless temperature @xmath103 itself flows to zero , controlled by the energy fluctuation exponent @xmath104 , the temperature being formally irrelevant . here and in the following we do not not make any spatial or temporal rescalings of coordinates or momenta .",
    "study of the one loop frg equation shows that , with the proper value for the roughness exponent @xmath105 depending on the universality class ( rb , rf or rp ) , the dimensionless disorder correlator converges _ non - uniformly _ to a nonanalytic `` fixed - point '' function @xmath75 formally of order @xmath106 as @xmath107 , whose functional form is not important for this discussion ( see however section iv for much more details ) .",
    "the non - uniformity of this convergence is due to a boundary - layer centered on @xmath108 , whose width decreases continuously with scale.@xcite in particular one can show that , to this order @xcite : @xmath109 thus asymptotically the curvature of the correlator diverges with the scale ( here @xmath110 is a constant depending of the universality class , e.g. for periodic systems @xmath111 , @xmath112 .    to one loop ,",
    "all that remains is the renormalization of the mean friction coefficient , since the elastic modulus is fixed by galilean invariance@xcite  and the temperature by the fluctuation - dissipation - theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "this was determined in refs .  .@xcite",

    "@xcite since the friction coefficient , which plays the role of a time scale @xmath118 , grows exponentially with the length @xmath119 : @xmath120.\\ ] ] ( in @xmath121 one has @xmath122 and @xmath123 )",
    ".    activated dynamics leads to ambiguities in a single time - scale approach , as can be seen from a simple matching argument .",
    "we consider for simplicity the equilibrium dynamics , in which the response and correlation functions are time - translationally invariant ( tti ) .",
    "it is then convenient to work in terms of both frequency @xmath124 and wavevector .",
    "the usual rg considerations lead one naively to expect that the response function obeys a relation , @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "we now obtain two _ inequivalent _ scaling forms by matching .",
    "in particular , if we choose @xmath127 ( we set @xmath128 for now ) , we find @xmath129 with @xmath130 if , however , we choose @xmath131 , we find asymptotically @xmath132 note that these two forms _ can not _ be related by redefining the two scaling functions @xmath133 , as can be seen from the fact that @xmath134 , which is _ not _ a function of @xmath135 only .",
    "the inequivalence of ( [ sf1],[sf2 ] ) appears to point to the existence of two scaling regimes , which we will call the @xmath136 and @xmath137 scaling limits .",
    "the first is formally defined by defining the scaling variable @xmath138 . with @xmath137",
    "fixed and @xmath139 , one obtains the scaling regime in ( [ sf1 ] ) .",
    "the second scaling regime obtains with @xmath140 fixed and @xmath141 . to reconcile the two regimes , note that @xmath142 , so that for fixed @xmath136 , as @xmath143 ( the @xmath136 scaling limit ) @xmath144 ! the second scaling regime ( ( [ sf2 ] ) ) thus appears to occur at the `` boundary '' ( @xmath145 ) of the first .",
    "we have indeed verified this behaviour , and obtained the analytical scaling forms similar to those in ( [ sf1],[sf2 ] ) using frg techniques _ under the assumption of a single characteristic time scale parameterized by @xmath146_. these calculations are performed in appendix a for equilibrium , and in appendix b for the more general nonequilibrium situation .",
    "interestingly , the general equations for the response function in this approach share some similarities to those arising in the ( infinitely connected and/or large @xmath147 ) mean field limit of a number of model glasses . as discussed in appendices a and b their solutions exhibit several time regimes with various aging scaling forms and also show differences compared to mean field .",
    "many features of these results , however , point to problems with the single time scale assumption , as also discussed in appendix a. the real - time response function is found to be an _ increasing _ function of wavevector at fixed time in the logarithmic ( @xmath136 ) scaling regime .",
    "this somewhat unexpected ( and possibly unphysical ) behavior is apparently a very general consequence of the mere _ existence _ of two distinct scaling limits , and hence is inevitable given the single time scale approach .",
    "more significantly , the appearance of a sharply - defined @xmath0 in the _ mean _ response function ( in the @xmath137 regime ) is difficult to understand on physical grounds . even in ( random ) models involving only a small number of degrees of freedom , while a given sample may be characterized by a longest relaxation time , the sample to sample variations of this would generally lead , as espoused in the introduction , to the disappearance of such a time in the mean response . in the collective elastic model considered here ,",
    "interactions between the enormous number of modes with differing wavevector ( and hence differing relaxation rates ) would only worsen the situation .",
    "up to this point , we have assumed that the dynamics at each scale can be described by a single friction coefficient @xmath148 , which corresponds to a sharply defined time scale for relaxation . on general grounds ,",
    "however , we should expect extremely broad distributions of relaxation times .",
    "this follows simply from the arrhenius law , @xmath149 which estimates the time required to overcome an energy barrier of height @xmath150 at scale @xmath1 . at low temperature ,",
    "even a modestly wide distribution of @xmath150 gives rise to extremely broadly distributed @xmath0 .",
    "if this distribution is sufficiently broad , it is no longer adequately characterized by its average , and indeed many physical quantities may depend upon the precise form of the distribution .",
    "we now investigate how this distribution can be incorporated into the frg treatment within the msr formalism .",
    "we will consider a spatially varying friction coefficient @xmath66 , with the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) modified to @xmath151 where , in order to maintain the stationary equilibrium boltzmann probability distribution function , the noise correlations are modified to @xmath152    for simplicity , we will initially take @xmath66 to be identically and independently distributed at each @xmath20 , according to the distribution @xmath153 .",

    "note that the @xmath167 kinetic term could equally well be considered as an interaction term , in the spirit of a `` perturbation theory in @xmath168 '' with bare propagator simply @xmath169 ( in real time @xmath170 ) .",
    "note also that for each realization , the instantaneous response function satisfies @xmath171 averaging over disorder gives @xmath172 .",
    "although it may seem obvious , it is important to stress at this stage that the renormalized relaxation time moments are measurable quantities .",
    "one can define the renormalized moments in the usual way from the effective action @xmath173 .",
    "taking the same form as ( [ smod2 ] ) , one has @xmath174 with of course many higher order terms describing the higher friction coefficient moments , momentum dependence of vertices , etc . as usual in field theory , correlation functions are exactly evaluated at tree level using this effective action  thus the @xmath175 term here has the meaning of a fully - renormalized second moment on the scale of the system size ( or infrared momentum cutoff ) .",
    "one may then consider the physically defined relaxation time from ( [ eq : samplemoment ] ) and construct its second moment : @xmath176 on physical grounds , in equilibrium , we expect that the latter product of response functions in two `` replicas '' is the same as considering the product of two subsequent responses in a single replica , provided the two response measurements are taken far apart .",
    "@xmath177 this latter four - point function can be calculated using the effective action above .",
    "one finds @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the infrared momentum cutoff , and @xmath180 denotes the convolution in the time domain . integrating over the time coordinates and using the result of statistical translational symmetry @xmath181 , one then obtains @xmath182 for a not too broad distribution of friction coefficients with scale - independent @xmath175 , the correction due to @xmath175 is vanishing for @xmath183 , and small compared to the first `` disconnected '' term ( scaling as @xmath184 ) for any @xmath21 . however ,",

    "remarkably , the random friction model represents an infinite manifold of fixed points parameterized by @xmath164 $ ] .",

    "this is because @xmath381 alone , with @xmath476 corresponds to a conservative dynamics.@xcite    these considerations show that to the order studied the @xmath400 dynamical action is fully specified by the @xmath74 action and the fdt constraints .",
    "thus we do not need to introduce at this stage any new operator associated to finite @xmath4 .",
    "having established that we are working with an appropriate action ( and hence have not neglected any pertinent coupling constants / functions ) , we turn briefly to the effects of additional thermal contractions upon the frg equations . up to this point ,",
    "the only such contractions we have included are the `` diffusion '' terms ( @xmath477 etc . ) in the frg equations for each coupling function .",
    "it appears natural to neglect most effects of temperature since it is an irrelevant variable under the frg , while clearly these diffusion terms are crucial , since they are necessary to stabilize the boundary layer . within this treatment",

    ", one can a priori perform thermal contractions that feed downward ( i.e. reduce the number of time derivatives ) in the frequency hierarchy , in particular by thermally contracting fields containing time derivatives . for some simple such contractions , a preliminary calculation shows that a cancellation in fact occurs amongst the different `` partners '' required by the fdt , eliminating the unwanted mixing .",
    "we do not have , however , a general argument for such a mechanism of cancellation . due to the complications of such a more general analysis , we will however proceed assuming this is generally true .",
    "we comment briefly further on this in the conclusion .",
    "having established that to this order no new terms arise due to temperature we now attempt to study the structure of the thermal boundary layer in the operators studied so far .",
    "we consider the level @xmath359 in some detail .",
    "we add the effect of temperature to lowest naive order which is to add to the right hand side of ( [ dg ] ) the term @xmath478 , originating from the simple tadpole contraction of the @xmath336 vertex .    from examination of this equation",
    "we expect that @xmath479 supports a thermal boundary layer form for @xmath480 @xmath481 with @xmath482 , @xmath483 an analytic function at @xmath484 , odd and positive for @xmath485 .",
    "it should match the fixed point form outside the boundary layer . for @xmath486 and @xmath487",
    "we expect @xmath488 .",

    "this can be seen since for large @xmath290 the linear problem has one exponentially growing solution , in addition to the one matching the outer solution which converges to a constant .",
    "thus @xmath505 must be tuned to select that solution .",
    "we illustrate this behaviour in the approximation of neglecting all third cumulant functions .",
    "then we recall that @xmath22 satisfies : @xmath506 whose solution is @xmath507 .",
    "since , as discussed earlier @xmath336 is a total derivative , it is possible to integrate the boundary layer equation once , and defining @xmath508 one obtains : @xmath509 with @xmath510 .",
    "one interesting solution but unrelated to the physics of interest here is @xmath511 , @xmath512 , i.e. @xmath513 .",
    "it corresponds to an integrable set of models with a single exponential relaxation , which exactly obey the full frg equations to one loop , and is studied in appendix .",

    "since these embody somewhat different physics we will focus initially on @xmath319 which fortunately satisfies equation ( [ frga ] ) which is independent of @xmath473 and @xmath381 .",
    "we add the effect of temperature to lowest naive order which is to add to the right hand side of ( [ frga],[frgb],[frgc ] ) the terms @xmath519 , @xmath520 , @xmath521 , respectively .",
    "these originate from the simple tadpole contractions .      in the previous section iii we pointed out the rapid divergence of the moments of the friction ( relaxation time ) @xmath522 driven by the low temperature divergence of @xmath523 . in doing",
    "so we neglected all functional dependence ( such as @xmath319 ) . in the previous subsection we reconsidered the growth of the average friction @xmath167 , which clearly does not itself",
    "has any functional dependence .",
    "instead the deviations of its growth from the prediction of section iii arise from a secondary mechanism of the feedback of @xmath496 into @xmath167 .",
    "physically it corresponds to the cross correlation @xmath336 of the friction @xmath462 with the random force @xmath18 producing an increased growth of @xmath167 .",
    "we would now like to reconsider the growth of the second moment @xmath524 including functional dependence . in this case already",
    "the leading effect of enhancement due to the divergence of @xmath523 is non - trivial .",
    "thus we will focus on it here primarily ignoring secondary effects of cross correlations between the random friction coefficient and the random force .",
    "in general these cross correlation effects enter the flow of @xmath379 through @xmath336 , @xmath365 and @xmath525 defined in ( [ eq : cals123 ] ) .",
    "terms involving @xmath365 and @xmath525 have already been dropped in ( [ frga ] ) for @xmath379 .",
    "we will initially keep terms involving @xmath336 in ( [ frga ] ) but will drop them at a later stage of the analysis .",
    "it is not clear at this stage whether keeping these terms without simultaneously including the ones due to @xmath365 and @xmath525 would be consistent .",
    "we then note that @xmath385 satisfies a closed equation once @xmath479 is known .",
    "we first consider the nature of its solution for @xmath526 outside the tbl .",

    ", we obtain the solution outside the tbl : @xmath527 where @xmath528 was defined above .",
    "note that , as was the case for @xmath374 the convergence is very rapid due to the homogeneous part @xmath529 .",
    "the important feature of this result is that @xmath319 is of order @xmath530 outside the tbl .",
    "we are going to search for a tbl solution for @xmath379 which grows faster : @xmath531 with @xmath532 . in order to match the above solution outside the tbl one should have @xmath533 .",
    "the tbl equation for @xmath534 then reads : @xmath535 due to the presumed faster growth of @xmath536 than @xmath530 ( @xmath532 ) the feeding terms in ( [ frga ] ) are negligible and have been dropped . as discussed above , since our principal interest is to compare the growth of the second relaxation moment parameterized by @xmath320 relative to the growth of the mean @xmath167 , to be consistent we drop the analogous renormalization of @xmath167 by @xmath496 , i.e. set @xmath537 in ( [ tblh ] )",
    ". numerical solution then yields : @xmath538 the analysis is thus consistent since we find @xmath539 . to the order considered we therefore have : @xmath540 this gives , in the present approximation @xmath541 .",

    "a shooting procedure gives @xmath570 , indeed greater than @xmath420 as required for consistency .",
    "in summary we find the growth of the kinetic coefficients : @xmath571    finally , we discuss the growth of @xmath572 .",
    "since it is fed by @xmath573 , it must grow at least as fast as @xmath574 , so all other feeding terms on the last line of ( [ frgb ] ) are certainly negligible .",
    "remarkably , even in the presence of the thermal @xmath575 term an asymptotically ( for large @xmath94 ) exact solution can be found . in particular",
    ", one finds that the homogeneous ( in @xmath572 ) part of the @xmath572 equation has an exact eigenfunction which is just @xmath576 , a constant independent of @xmath45 .",
    "this turns out to be the most unstable eigenfunction , with eigenvalue @xmath577 .",
    "the exponential growth of this unstable eigenfunction is faster than that of @xmath573 , and hence dominates the flow at large scales .",
    "hence , writing this relative in terms of @xmath578 ( neglecting the @xmath505 renormalization of @xmath146 as before ) , one finds @xmath579",
    "we have through a series of successively better approximations arrived at a description of the growth of the moments of relaxation times ( friction coefficient ) encoded as eigenvalues of functional frg equations .",
    "this final stage of analysis was carried out only for the mean and variance  the extension to higher moments is a formidable technical challenge .",
    "nevertheless , already at this level we have observed how these functional eigenvalue problems provide a mechanism for describing a broad but non - trivial ( i.e. not log - normal ) distribution of time scales .",
    "this is at variance with numerous other existing examples of systems exhibiting simpler log - normal tails which can be obtained from simpler non - linear sigma model diagrammatic calculations , such as in disordered conductors.@xcite a similar log - normal tail was indeed obtained in section iii from an approximate truncation of the frg equation .",
    "a rather strong physical difference from the aforementioned quantum diffusion problem is the rapid exponential scale dependence of the relaxation times for @xmath580 , very different from the logarithmic dependence of two dimensional weak localization corrections .",
    "it is an open question whether some less trivial distribution might arise at the metal - insulator transition in @xmath581 and whether similar functional renormalization ideas might be useful in this context .",
    "many outstanding issues and extensions remain . of these , the most fundamental are germane to both the dynamics and the statics.@xcite in particular the very basic problem of perturbative control of the theory ( most interestingly in the @xmath503-expansion ) remains unsolved .",
    "this question , and the associated matching problem of relating e.g. random force quantities like the @xmath582 in ( [ bl ] ) defined deep within the boundary layer at @xmath108 to the zero temperature ones occurring far outside for @xmath583 are better addressed in the simpler context of the statics .",
    "we will refrain from commenting further upon them here .    of the problems specific to the dynamics ,",
    "perhaps most important is a systematic treatment of all thermal terms in the frg .",
    "we have begun this program by classifying all operators associated with `` thermal noises '' in the effective action ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamical - action - at ] ) consistent with the fdt .",
    "however , up to this point we have included the effects of non - zero temperature only through the leading `` diffusion '' terms ( @xmath584 etc . ) in the frg equations for each coupling function . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamical - action - at ] , while this assumption is natural , we do not at this stage have a general justification for it .",
    "the importance of additional thermal contractions thus remains an important issue for further investigation .",
    "once these basic remaining issues in the frg formulation are resolved , the present methods offer the opportunity to explore numerous physical problems .",
    "obviously , equilibrium response and correlation functions are of considerable interest .",
    "perhaps the approximate techniques of section iii ( and appendix  [ general ] ) may have an extension to the full functional description .",
    "it will also be valuable to reinvestigate the response to a uniform applied force in the creep regime,@xcite in light of the full dynamical structure of the thermal boundary layer exposed here .",
    "applications of these ideas to non - equilibrium response and aging is also tantalizing .",
    "similar approaches should be applicable to quantum problems in the keldysh formalism . these and other applications of the present formulation certainly provide a broad scope for future progress in understanding glassy dynamics .",

    "were supported by the nsf - cnrs program through nsf grant int-0089835 , and cnrs projet 10674 .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the two _ putative _ scaling regimes described in sec .",
    "[ sec : onetime ]  arise in a detailed calculation of the mean response function .",
    "to do so , we develop an frg scheme to calculate directly the response function at arbitrary @xmath585 within the scaling regimes described above .",
    "it is necessary to follow the flow of the full wavevector and frequency dependence of the `` kinetic '' part of the msr action .",

    "the scaling _ functions _ themselves were found to be non - trivial , with interesting analytical structure .",
    "while the existence of the @xmath642 regime seems to be a straightforward consequence of the assumption of a single time scale @xmath0 , the emergence of the @xmath667 regime within this hypothesis is less obvious . within the wilson scheme , it seems to result from the system keeping a memory of a whole spectrum of smaller relaxation times @xmath668 , @xmath669 , generated during the coarse graining procedure and naturally appears here ( while one would naively expect the largest one only , @xmath0 to play a role ) . it does have the form of _ activated dynamics",
    "_ since the scaling variable is truly @xmath670 and thus corresponds to crossing barriers of heigth @xmath671 . that such an activated regime should exist",
    "is physically rather natural .",
    "indeed we expect from simple droplet arguments that the equilibrium dynamics of mode @xmath1 at large time difference ( in general @xmath602 , denoted here @xmath211 ) is dominated by the rare active configurations with ( at least ) two quasi - degenerate low free energy states at scale @xmath672 of the system .",
    "the probability to find two nearly degenerate minima ( on the scale of the thermal energy @xmath4 ) at scale @xmath673 is @xmath674 .",
    "one expects these two minima to be separated by a barrier @xmath675 also scaling like @xmath676 and thus when @xmath677 _ equilibrium _ thermally activated motion back and forth over this barrier @xcite becomes active and gives rise to time - dependent correlations on the scale @xmath678 .",
    "our analytical result thus exhibits the correct scaling behaviour and it is thus encouraging that such barrier crossing behaviour and scaling comes out of the present rg calculation .    upon a closer look to our results in the x regime , everything works as if there is an effective distribution of smaller barriers @xmath679 with a distribution of relaxation times @xmath680 for @xmath681 . the total weight of this distribution being only @xmath674 it can be written as @xmath682 .",
    "@xmath683 diverges at @xmath684 .",
    "this is easily seen , e.g. on the form for the correlations .",
    "indeed , using the above fdt relation one obtains : @xmath685 for the correlations in the logarithmic regime . in this expression ,",
    "the @xmath686 equilibrium correlation is usually explained as @xmath687 , i.e the product of the size of a positional fluctuation between two degenerate states at scale @xmath1 and the probability of this active configuration to occur .",
    "thus we see that there is here an additional reduction by an extra factor @xmath688 , the total weight of barriers much smaller than @xmath0 ( note that the above correlation variations within regime x are subdominant compared to the ones in regime y , which really account for all but a small fraction of the total variation ) .",
    "similarly one sees that the response corresponding to a barrier @xmath689 can be written as : @xmath690 as @xmath691 with @xmath692 . thus averaging with the weight @xmath693 yields exactly our result @xmath694 in regime",
    "x if one chooses : @xmath695",
    "another puzzling feature of the above results is the nonmonotonicity of the above scaling functions . as discussed below this",
    "is directly related to the assumption of a single time scale , and has prompted us to reconsider the whole calculation ( at a high price of technical difficulty ) in section  [ sec : fterm ] .",
    "we see from ( [ sigtti ] ) that @xmath605 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 always and that @xmath694 at fixed @xmath168 is an increasing function of @xmath1 for @xmath1 small enough .",

    "while this behavior is unexpected , we are presently unsure whether it is in fact unphysical .",
    "what is clear is that it is a consequence of the single time scale assumption .",
    "indeed , the rather simple and apparently physical expression @xmath697 is also increasing with @xmath1 for small @xmath3 .",
    "it appears that one can argue fairly generally that , provided there exists a long - time regime with a _ well - defined _",
    "@xmath0 , the response must be increasing with @xmath1 for @xmath698 .",
    "as discussed at length in the text , one does expect that the single time scale description is unsufficient and one should instead consider a distribution of time scales .",
    "let us examine the question of monotonicity when @xmath651 is simply a superposition of elementary relaxation processes . discarding the subdominant @xmath699 prefactor and writing @xmath700 where @xmath701 is the scale",

    "note however that this supposes the gaussian to hold down to @xmath711 , which may not be the case in general . on the other hand",
    "the only real condition concerns the monotonicity of the scaling function itself .",
    "thus , one way to reduce the effect of nonmonotonicity is to increase the width of the distribution of time scales .    to close this discussion",
    ", it is useful to contrast the present situation of an elastic system with fast growing barriers with what happens in the marginal case @xmath712 .",
    "this is realized for a periodic model in @xmath713 , e.g. for the line of fixed points of the cardy ostlund model .",

    "note finally that even in this case , the scaling regime @xmath651 is again nonmonotonous : it vanishes at @xmath736 , increases up to @xmath737 , with @xmath738 and decreases beyond .",
    "the rg recursion relation for the response function derived above was not restricted to equilibrium , and it is thus interesting to write down the corresponding equations ( for response and correlations ) in the full non - equilibrium regime . within the intrinsic limitations of the single time scale approach ,",
    "this allows in principle to acces the aging properties of the system .    to obtain closed equations for the two time response function @xmath739 one again iterates",
    "( [ rflow1 ] ) from the same ( tti ) initial condition @xmath740 up to @xmath741 , keeping @xmath427 finite and making no tti assumption .",
    "thus the response satisfies the differential equation : @xmath742 where matrix multiplication and inversion is with respect to ( t , t ) .",
    "it is more convenient to avoid the two time self energy and write a closed equation for @xmath739 as : @xmath743 with initial condition @xmath744 .",

    "@xmath739 depends on three variables but in the limit @xmath745 , @xmath746 , @xmath747 we expect that it takes scaling forms depending only on two variables .",
    "what these variables really are depends on the time regime , and one can identify several possible time regimes and subregimes .",
    "they can be classified as follows , where we indicate the form expected for the response function @xmath739 , by order of increasing time and time differences :    @xmath748    regime ( iii ) is the equilibrium tti regime , where the only dependence is in @xmath602 .",

    "indeed for @xmath753 we expect that there will be a fully tti equilibrium regime , but it is also expected to be nonuniversal . a universal , _ quasi - equilibrium _ regime is expected however for @xmath754 , @xmath755 ( regimes ( i a ) and ( ii a ) ) .",
    "as the time difference increases it should crossover at @xmath756 to an intermediate aging regime ( regimes ( i b ) and ( ii b ) ) .",
    "regime i is most complex as there one expects two later regimes as @xmath757 , @xmath758 crossing over to yet another scaling regime when @xmath211 reaches @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that either in sinai model @xcite or even more clearly in the 1d random field ising model @xcite such regimes are also expected , some have been studied demonstrated and studied in details ( there is also an equilibration time scale analogous to @xmath0 ) .    in the determination of all the above",

    "this is relevant also for the disorder case , since averaging over disorder one gets , an @xmath360 term with @xmath381 a first derivative , @xmath1044 and @xmath1045 .",
    "this indeed is the condition for invariance of the @xmath360 term under the continuous global @xmath420 symmetry .",
    "another symmetry often considered associated to fdt is @xmath1046 , @xmath1047 .",
    "this is a symmetry of the unaveraged dynamical effective action .",
    "it is useful e.g. to study @xcite consequences of the accidental fdt property of the one dimensional kpz equation .",
    "it seems however a priori less useful in order to study the effective action once one integrates over modes , i.e. in the context of wilson frg ( also further complications arise after averaging over disorder ) .",
    "it may be worth studying within the exact rg context , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "ideally one should also take into account the influence of modes with wavevectors @xmath1053 on the relaxation of mode @xmath1 since these are obviously left out of the rg scheme .",
    "however simple arguments suggest that this influence decays fast : the influence of the jumps in the mode @xmath1006 on the mode @xmath1 may decay as fast as @xmath1054 .",
    "at least this is necessary condition for such droplet arguments to make sense .",
    "note however that if the initial condition starts in an interval two adjacent minima and maxima which does not contains a zero of @xmath989 , it instead converges in finite time to one of the endpoint of the interval at which @xmath991 vanishes .",
    "the solution in ( [ g4 ] ) analytically continues the relaxation of the force to zero ."
