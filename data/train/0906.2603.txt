    "the transmission of sources over a gaussian broadcast channel @xcite is a fundamental problem in information theory and arguably one of the better understood questions . in the case of independent sources over this degraded channel , the capacity region",

    "@xcite can also be used to the same effect .",
    "in contrast , the existing body of work on correlated sources over a broadcast channel is somewhat limited @xcite .",
    "as source - channel separation does not hold , it is difficult to construct coding strategies and establish their optimality . recently in @xcite , uncoded transmission of correlated gaussians over a gaussian broadcast channel was shown to be optimal below a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) threshold . in related work , the transmission of a common source over a gaussian broadcast channel with receiver side information was studied in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider hybrid coding as a strategy for the gaussian broadcast channel with or without correlated sources . by hybrid coding , we mean strategies that superimpose uncoded and coded transmission in communicating the sources to the destinations .",
    "our hybrid coding strategy bears close resemblance to the dirty - paper - coding strategy using lattices , as developed in @xcite .",
    "we show that this hybrid strategy is optimal for the gaussian broadcast channel with independent gaussian sources . extending it to the correlated case , we find that the strategy performs better ( in terms of the distortion region achieved ) than separate source and channel coding for snrs below a certain threshold .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the system model . in section [ sec : outerbound ] , we present an outer bound on the distortion region for this channel .",
    "we present the achievable scheme and the resulting distortion region for this channel in section [ sec : achievable ] and conclude with section [ sec : conclude ] .",
