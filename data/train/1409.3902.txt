    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) has attracted a lot of research interest recently @xcite . typically , the uplink transmission in massive mimo systems consists of two phases : uplink training ( to estimate the channels ) and uplink payload data transmission . in previous works on massive mimo",
    ", the transmit power of each symbol is assumed to be the same during the training and data transmission phases @xcite .",
    "however , this equal power allocation policy causes a `` squaring effect '' in the low power regime @xcite .",
    "the squaring effect comes from the fact that when the transmit power is reduced , both the data signal and the pilot signal suffer from a power reduction . as a result ,",
    "in the low power regime , the capacity scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the transmit power .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the uplink of massive multicell mimo with maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) receivers at the base station ( bs ) .",
    "we consider mrc receivers since they are simple and perform rather well in massive mimo , particularly when the inherent effect of channel estimation on intercell interference is taken into account @xcite .",
    "contrary to most prior works , we assume that the average transmit powers of pilot symbol and data symbol are different .",
    "we investigate a resource allocation problem which finds the transmit pilot power , transmit data power , as well as , the training duration that maximize the sum spectral efficiency for a given total energy budget spent in a coherence interval .",
    "our numerical results show appreciable benefits of the proposed optimal resource allocation . at low signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , more power is needed for training to reduce the squaring effect , while at high snrs , more power is allocated to data transmission .    regarding related works , @xcite elaborated on a similar issue . in @xcite , the authors considered point - to - point mimo systems , and in @xcite , the authors considered single - input multiple - output multiple access channels with scheduling .",
    "most importantly , the performance metric used in @xcite was the mutual information without any specific signal processing . in this work , however , we consider massive multicell multiuser mimo systems with mrc receivers and demonstrate the strong potential of these configurations .",
    "we consider the uplink multicell mimo system described in @xcite .",
    "the system has @xmath2 cells .",
    "each cell includes one @xmath3-antenna bs , and @xmath4 single - antenna terminals , where @xmath5 .",
    "all @xmath2 cells share the same frequency band .",
    "the transmission comprises two phases : uplink training and data transmission .      in the uplink training phase ,",
    "the bs estimates the channel from received pilot signals transmitted from all terminals .",
    "in each cell , @xmath4 terminals are assigned @xmath4 orthogonal pilot sequences of length @xmath6 symbols ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is the length of the coherence interval . since the coherence interval is limited , we assume that the same orthogonal pilot sequences are reused in all @xmath2 cells .",
    "this causes the so - called _ pilot contamination _ @xcite . note that interference from data symbols is as bad as interference from pilots @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the channel matrix between the bs in the @xmath10th cell and the @xmath4 terminals in the @xmath11th cell .",
    "the @xmath12th element of @xmath13 is modeled as @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the small - scale fading coefficient from the @xmath16th antenna of the @xmath10th bs to the @xmath17th terminal in the @xmath11th cell , and @xmath18 is a constant that represents large - scale fading ( pathloss and shadow fading ) .    at the @xmath10th bs ,",
    "the minimum mean - square error channel estimate for the @xmath17th column of the channel matrix @xmath19 is @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the transmit power of each pilot symbol , and @xmath22 represents additive noise .      in this phase ,",
    "all @xmath4 terminals send their data to the bs .",
    "let @xmath23 be a vector of symbols transmitted from the @xmath4 terminals in the @xmath11th cell , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 denotes expectation , and @xmath1 be the average transmitted power of each terminal .",
    "the @xmath26 received vector at the @xmath10th bs is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the awgn vector , distributed as @xmath29 .",
    "then , bs @xmath10 uses mrc together with the channel estimate to detect the signals transmitted from the @xmath4 terminals in its own cell .",
    "more precisely , to detect the signal transmitted from the @xmath17th terminal , @xmath30 , the received vector @xmath31 is pre - multiplied with @xmath32 to obtain : @xmath33 and then @xmath30 can be extracted directly from @xmath34 .      in our analysis ,",
    "the performance metric is the sum spectral efficiency ( in bits / s / hz ) . from , and following a similar methodology as in @xcite , we obtain an achievable ergodic rate of the transmission from the @xmath17th terminal in the @xmath10th cell to its bs as : and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , for all @xmath17 , was derived in @xcite , see eq .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 the sum spectral efficiency is defined as @xmath40    for @xmath41 , and for @xmath21 fixed regardless of @xmath1 , we have @xmath42 while for @xmath43 ( the choice considered in @xcite and other literature we are aware of ) , we have @xmath44 interestingly , at low @xmath1 , the sum spectral efficiency scales linearly with @xmath3 [ since @xmath45 , even though the number of unknown channel parameters increases .",
    "we can see that for the case of @xmath21 being fixed regardless of @xmath1 , at @xmath41 , the sum spectral efficiency scales as @xmath1 .",
    "however , for the case of @xmath46 , at @xmath41 , the sum spectral efficiency scales as @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that when @xmath1 decreases and , hence , @xmath21 decreases , the quality of the channel estimate deteriorates , which leads to a `` squaring effect '' on the sum spectral efficiency @xcite .",
    "consider now the bit energy of a system defined as the transmit power expended divided by the sum spectral efficiency : @xmath47 if @xmath46 as in previous works , we have @xmath48 .",
    "then , from , when the transmit power is reduced below a certain threshold , the bit energy increases even when we reduce the power ( and , hence , reduce the spectral efficiency ) . as a result",
    ", the minimum bit energy is achieved at a non - zero sum spectral efficiency .",
    "evidently , it is inefficient to operate below this sum spectral efficiency .",
    "however , we can operate in this regime if we use a large enough transmit power for uplink pilots , and reduce the transmit power of data .",
    "this observation is clearly outlined in the next section .",
    "using different powers for the uplink training and data transmission phases improves the system performance , especially in the wideband regime , where the spectral efficiency is conventionally parameterized as an affine function of the energy per bit @xcite .",
    "motivated by this observation , we consider a fundamental resource allocation problem , which adjusts the data power , pilot power , and duration of pilot sequences , to maximize the sum spectral efficiency given in .",
    "note that , this resource allocation can be implemented at the bs .",
    "let @xmath49 be the total transmit energy constraint for each terminal in a coherence interval .",
    "then , we have @xmath50 when @xmath51 decreases , we can see from that the effect of noise on the channel estimate escalates , and hence the channel estimate degrades .",
    "however , under the total energy constraint , @xmath52 will increase , and hence the system performance may improve .",
    "conversely , we could increase the accuracy of the channel estimate by using more power for training . at the same time",
    ", we have to reduce the transmit power for the data transmission phase to satisfy . thus , there are optimal values of @xmath6 , @xmath21 , and @xmath1 which maximize the sum spectral efficiency for given @xmath49 and @xmath8 .",
    "once the total transmit energy per coherence interval and the number of terminals are set , one can adjust the duration of pilot sequences and the transmitted powers of pilots and data to maximize the sum spectral efficiency .",
    "more precisely , @xmath53 where the inequality of the total energy constraint in becomes the equality in , due to the fact that for a given @xmath6 and @xmath21 , @xmath54 is an increasing function of @xmath1 , and for a given @xmath6 and @xmath1 , @xmath54 is an increasing function of @xmath21 .",
    "hence , @xmath54 is maximized when @xmath55 .",
    "[ lemma1 ] the optimal pilot duration , @xmath6 , of @xmath56 is equal to the number of terminals @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath57 be a solution of @xmath56 .",
    "assume that @xmath58 .",
    "next we choose @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "clearly , this choice of system parameters @xmath62 satisfies the constraints in . from and using the fact that @xmath63",
    ", we have @xmath64 which contradicts the assumption",
    ". therefore , @xmath65 .    from proposition  [ lemma1 ]",
    ", @xmath56 is equivalent to the following optimization problem : @xmath66    we can efficiently solve @xmath67 based on the following property :    [ lemma 1 ] the program @xmath67 is concave .",
    "see appendix  [ proof lemm1 ] .    to solve the optimization problem",
    "@xmath67 , we can use any nonlinear or convex optimization method to get the globally optimal result . here , we use the fmincon function in matlab s optimization toolbox .    ) .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we consider a cellular network with @xmath68 hexagonal cells which have a radius of @xmath69 m .",
    "each cell serves @xmath70 terminals ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath72 , corresponding to a coherence bandwidth of @xmath73  khz and a coherence time of @xmath74  ms .",
    "we consider the performance in the cell in the center of the network .",
    "we assume that terminals are located uniformly and randomly in each cell and no terminal is closer to the bs than @xmath75 m .",
    "large - scale fading is modeled as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a log - normal random variable , @xmath78 denotes the distance between the @xmath17th terminal in the @xmath11th cell and the @xmath10th bs , and @xmath79 is the path loss exponent .",
    "we set the standard deviation of @xmath77 to @xmath80db , and @xmath81 .",
    "firstly , we will examine the sum spectral efficiency versus the bit energy obtained from one snapshot generated by the above large - scale fading model .",
    "the bit energy is defined in . from and",
    ", we can see that the solution of @xmath56 also leads to the minimum value of the bit energy .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] presents the sum spectral efficiency versus the bit energy with optimal resource allocation .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec spect ] , the minimum bit energy is achieved at a non - zero spectral efficiency .",
    "for example , with optimal resource allocation , at @xmath82 , the minimum bit energy is achieved at a sum spectral efficiency of @xmath83 bits / s / hz which is marked by a circle in the figure .",
    "below this value , the bit energy increases as the sum spectral efficiency decreases . for a given energy per bit ,",
    "there are two operating points .",
    "operating below the sum spectral efficiency , at which the minimum energy per bit is obtained , should be avoided .    on a different note",
    ", we can see that with optimal resource allocation , the system performance improves significantly .",
    "for example , to achieve the same sum spectral efficiency of @xmath70 bits / s / hz , optimal resource allocation can improve the energy efficiencies by factors of @xmath84 and @xmath85 compared to the case of no resource allocation with @xmath86 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "this dramatic increase underscores the importance of resource allocation in massive mimo .",
    "however , at high bit energy , the squaring effect for the case of no resource allocation disappears and , hence , the advantages of resource allocation diminish .",
    "furthermore , for the same sum spectral efficiency , @xmath87 bits / s / hz , and with resource allocation , by doubling the number of bs antennas from @xmath88 to @xmath89 , we can improve the energy efficiency by a factor of @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding ratio of the optimal pilot power to the optimal transmitted data power for @xmath86 and @xmath82 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . here",
    ", we define @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath49 is the total transmit energy spent in a coherence interval @xmath8 and the noise variance is @xmath74 , @xmath92 has the interpretation of average transmit snr and is therefore dimensionless .",
    "we can see that at low @xmath92 ( or low spectral efficiency ) , we spend more power during the training phase , and vice versa at high @xmath92 . at low @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath93 which leads to @xmath94 .",
    "this means that half of the total energy is used for uplink training and the other half is used for data transmission .",
    "note that the power allocation problem in the low snr regime is useful since the achievable rate ( obtained under the assumption that the estimation error is additive gaussian noise ) is very tight , due to the use of jensen s bound in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in general , the ratio of the optimal pilot power to the optimal data power does not always monotonically decrease with increasing @xmath92 .",
    "we can see from the figure that , when @xmath92 is around @xmath95db , @xmath96 increases when @xmath92 increases .",
    "we now consider the cumulative distribution of the sum spectral efficiency obtained from @xmath97 snapshots of large - scale fading ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "as expected , our resource allocation improves the system performance substantially , especially at low snr .",
    "more importantly , with resource allocation , the sum spectral efficiencies are more concentrated around their means compared to the case of no resource allocation . for example , at @xmath98db , resource allocation increases the @xmath99-likely sum spectral efficiency by a factor of @xmath83 compared to the case of no resource allocation .",
    "conventionally , in massive mimo , the transmit powers of the pilot signal and data payload signal are assumed to be equal . in this paper , we have posed and answered a basic question about the operation of massive mimo : how much would the performance improve if the relative energy of the pilot waveform , compared to that of the payload waveform , were chosen optimally ?",
    "the partitioning of time , or equivalently bandwidth , between pilots and data within a coherence interval was also optimally selected .",
    "we found that , with @xmath89 antennas at the bs , by optimally allocating energy to pilots , the energy efficiency can be increased as much as @xmath100 , when each terminal has a throughput of about @xmath74 bit / s / hz .",
    "typically , when the snr is low ( e.g. , around @xmath101db ) , at the optimum , the transmit power is then about @xmath70 times higher during the training phase than during the data transmission phase .      from and , the problem @xmath67 becomes @xmath102 where @xmath103 the second derivative of @xmath104 can be expressed as : @xmath105 where @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 since @xmath110 , @xmath111 . therefore , @xmath104 is a concave function in @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath113 is a concave and increasing function , @xmath114 is also a concave function . finally ,",
    "using the fact that the summation of concave functions is concave , we conclude the proof of proposition  [ lemma 1 ] .",
