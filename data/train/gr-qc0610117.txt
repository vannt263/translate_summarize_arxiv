    "gravitational waves are ripples of space - time curvature caused by violent astronomical events such as supernova explosion or binary - stars coalescence .",
    "the waves , upon arrival at the earth , are very weak .",
    "for example , although currently operating gravitational - wave detectors can detect tiny strains of @xmath1 ( at @xmath2100hz ) , astrophysical estimates still predict a low chance for detection .",
    "nevertheless , recent and projected improvements in sensitivity may soon allow us to have sizable chances of detecting gravitational waves .",
    "the basic design of current gravitational - wave detectors  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite is based on michelson interferometry .",
    "the laser beam splitted to two long arms senses a change of space - time during the round trip , being reflected back by mirrors at the end of the arms .",
    "a few more mirrors are added to the michelson interferometer to make resonant cavities that can enhance the laser power and/or the gravitational - wave signals ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fpmi ] ) .",
    "sensitivity of a detector is determined by the ratio of the signal and noise at each frequency .",
    "there are various kinds of noise on the detector , among which the most fundamental one is shot noise that comes from vacuum fluctuation of the light field .",
    "shot - noise - limited sensitivity can be improved with an increase of the signal by making arms longer or by raising the light power in the arms .",
    "recent improvement in development of the high - stability laser allows us to assume more than 100  w light to be injected to the interferometer . inside the arm cavities",
    "could be more than few mega - watts with a use of low - loss mirrors .",
    "however , we can not improve the sensitivity of a gravitational - wave detector only by increasing the power .",
    "besides shot noise , displacement noise due to thermal fluctuation or seismic motion limits the sensitivity , and displacement noise increases with the gravitational - wave signal when we raise the light power .",
    "figure  [ fig:3kand600 m ] shows noise spectra of fabry - perot michelson interferometers with the arm length of 3  km and 600  m. the laser power circulating in the arm cavities is 5 times higher in the 600  m interferometer so that the shot noise level appears to be same as the 3  km interferometer .",
    "one can see displacement noise is larger in the smaller interferometer , which can be explained in two ways : ( i ) the motion of the mirror in displacement ( @xmath3 ) is same and the sensitivity in strain ( @xmath4 ) is derived from that divided by the arm length , or ( ii ) the detector is more sensitive to the motion of the mirror when it has more power inside the arm cavity . in this paper , we pick a sum of mirror thermal noise and seismic noise , shown in the graph with reasonable parameters currently available , as displacement noise for discussions , ignoring other small noise shown by light - gray lines and quantum radiation - pressure noise that seems to limit the sensitivity of 600  m interferometer because of the use of unnecessarily high power in the cavity .    , height=160 ]    , height=158 ]    consequently gravitational - wave detectors should have as long arms as possible to decrease displacement noise appearing on the strain sensitivity .",
    "in other words , a detector could be shorter , which means cheaper , if it is possible to remove displacement noise ; or we can say a detector could be sensitive at low frequencies with a same size .    let us see if there is a way to remove displacement noise .",
    "first of all responses of a detector to gravitational waves and displacement noise must be different , otherwise the signal disappears with the removal of displacement noise .",
    "indeed , they can be different .",
    "@xcite one difference appears in a simple michelson interferometer , where a gravitational - wave signal can flip the sign between the former half and the latter half of the journey at around a particular frequency and its odd harmonics . at the exact particular frequencies , displacement noise of the end mirrors remains and a gravitational - wave signal disappears .",
    "it is the other way round from what we want to do .",
    "the key to eliminate displacement noise is to probe the mirror motion more than once .",
    "probably the most common situation is with a sagnac interferometer .",
    "@xcite splitted by a beamsplitter , two lights probe the motion of two end mirrors in a different order with some time delay . at particular frequencies depending on the time delay ,",
    "we can remove displacement noise with gravitational - wave signals remaining .",
    "also , recently kawamura and chen found a way to remove displacement noise at all the frequencies using a combination of multiple beams that probe each mirror motion more than once ; the system is called displacement - noise - free interferometer ( dfi ) .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite we shall name the former one a _",
    "narrow - band _ dfi and the latter one a _ broadband _ dfi .",
    "however , we still need long arms with dfi configurations . the frequency at which displacement noise can be cancelled in a sagnac interferometer depends on the time difference between two probings , which means it is a very high frequency unless the arm is very long .",
    "the response of a broadband dfi to gravitational waves decays at low frequencies by @xmath5 or @xmath6 , depending on the configuration , up to a certain frequency that is also determined by the arm length so that it also requires the long arms .    here",
    "one might reconcile to make a sensitivity of a short - arm detector comparable to that of a long - arm detector , but we would like to point out there could be a way to circumvent the problem .",
    "the reason why we need long arms in a non - dfi detector is to receive gravitational waves without probing mirror motions , and the reason why we need long arms in a dfi detector is to wait for some time that makes the phase of gravitational waves change .",
    "the former reason can be answered only with long arms unless the carrier is changed from light to something slow  @xcite , while the latter one can be answered not only with long arms but also with a use of a time - delay device that can trap the light for some time .",
    "note that the light being trapped by a time - delay device , with our definition , does not sense gravitational waves during the trapment .",
    "there are many ways to implement time delay to the light : optical fibers , multiple cavities , or a quantum optics device based on _ electromagnetically induced transparency _ ( eit ) .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , applying a time - delay device to a narrow - band and to a broadband dfi detector , we will see how the sensitivities can be improved at low frequencies .",

    "let us derive the response of an interferometer to gravitational waves .",
    "orientation of the wave source is expressed with @xmath7 and @xmath8 by @xmath9 we assume that the wave propagates along the @xmath10 axis . at the time when the waves and the light of an interferometer reach the same point , the speed of light slightly changes by @xmath11 $ ] .",

    "gravitational waves have two polarizations , which are @xmath19 mode that causes a differential change between @xmath20 axis and @xmath21 axis , and @xmath22 mode that causes a differential change between @xmath23 axis and @xmath24 axis . the following function",
    "will be multiplied to @xmath25 of each mode : @xmath26 the phase shift @xmath25 is a function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    ", one can see a possible difference from the response to displacement noise .",
    "there is a factor @xmath30 in front of @xmath31 inside the bracket , which shows that the light senses gravitational waves with a doppler shift when the waves do not come from the top of the sky .",
    "if one can somehow prepare a situation where displacement noise at some frequencies disappears , the detector can sense waves whose frequency is shifted by this effect without sensing displacement noise .",
    "note that , if the light returns to the same direction as its coming journey , the doppler shift cancels after the round trip .",
    "we can have one direction for the coming beam , another direction for the going beam , and a mirror motion is measured in the bisector angle of these two directions .",
    "we can say this is a two - dimensional measurement , comparing with a usual one - dimensional measurement , in which the light is normally incident on a mirror .",
    ", height=132 ]    another possible difference from the response to displacement noise also appears at the two - dimensional measurement .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmeasurement ] . assuming",
    "the orientation of gravitational waves is that with @xmath32 , and the incident angle of the light is 45 degrees , we have @xmath33 for the outgoing beam to and the incoming beam from the left side ( @xmath34 at @xmath14 and @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 for the beam to and from the right side ( @xmath34 at @xmath13 and @xmath37 ) ; @xmath38 is always zero .",
    "if the phase shift after a time interval @xmath39 is @xmath40 , and we add the results before and after the interval , displacement noise will disappear . on the other hand , gravitational - wave signal will remain due to the flip of the sign of @xmath41 between @xmath42 and @xmath35 , or @xmath43 and @xmath37 , which cancels the phase shift of @xmath34 after the time interval .",
    "if the incident angle is 0 degrees , @xmath41 is always zero and @xmath38 is always @xmath44 , so the phase shift after time interval makes the cancellation of displacement noise and gravitational waves occur at the same time .",
    "we shall see the noise - cancellation effect in a sagnac interferometer , for example .",
    "figure  [ fig : sagnacs ] shows a couple of sagnac configurations and their noise spectra . in one sagnac , the beams propagating toward two directions after a beamsplitter get reflected by end mirrors almost to the same way , reaching a mirror placed close to the beamsplitter that folds the beams to the end mirrors on the other side , and",
    "then two beams interfere to send only differential signals to a photodetector placed at the other side from the laser .",

    "to eliminate displacement noise of the mirrors and the beamsplitter at a same frequency , the distances between the optical components should be chosen appropriately .",
    "it has turned out from our calculation that the frequencies of the cancellation can not be same if the configuration is in a regular triangle .",
    "we choose the distance between one of the mirrors and the beamsplitter to be 600  m , and the distance between the two mirrors to be 400  m , which makes the cancellation frequencies exactly equal as is shown in fig .",

    "the power recycling will be realized by a mirror that reflects back the light returned towards the laser ( bright port ) , and the signal recycling will be realized by a mirror at the other side of the power - recycling mirror ( dark port ) to reflect back the signal components . at frequencies higher than @xmath45  hz ,",
    "in the case shown above , the signal starts cancellation during the circulation in the signal - recycling cavity . here",
    "we assume no recycling just for simplicity .",
    "orientation of gravitational waves is averaged all over the sky .",
    "it is good to have a sensitivity not limited by displacement noise , but the displacement - noise - free frequency is actually higher than the frequencies where displacement noise limits the sensitivity in a usual detector ( fig .",

    "<S> interferometers with kilometer - scale arms have been built for gravitational - wave detections on the ground ; ones with much longer arms are being planned for space - based detection . </S>",
    "<S> one fundamental motivation for long baseline interferometry is from displacement noise . in general , </S>",
    "<S> the longer the arm length @xmath0 , the larger the motion the gravitational - wave induces on the test masses , until @xmath0 becomes comparable to the gravitational wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> recently , schemes have been invented , in which displacement noise can be evaded by employing differences between the influence of test - mass motions and that of gravitational waves on light propagation . however , in these schemes , such differences only becomes significant when @xmath0 approaches the gravitational wavelength . in this paper , we explore a use of artificial time delay in displacement - noise - free interferometers , which will shift the frequency band of the effect being significant and may improve their shot - noise - limited sensitivity at low frequencies . </S>"
