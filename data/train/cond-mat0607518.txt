    "the science of graphs and networks is nowadays a well studied topic receiving more and more interest due to its large number of applications in the understanding of complex systems in , technological , biological and social structures .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the literature @xcite . as a basic starting point in the analysis of the cooperative behavior typical of such complex systems , the study of the simplest dichotomy - interaction models , such as the ising model , plays a crucial role and in recent years successful efforts",
    "have been made in solving this model @xcite , which , on networks , and especially on the so called `` scale free networks '' , may manifest critical phenomena very different from those over regular lattice systems @xcite . the ising model with only ferromagnetic couplings , however , allows only a `` friendly '' interaction between the elements of the network , @xmath0 , so that only a possible two - state `` friendly '' collective behavior is allowed . for taking into account that the interaction between the elements of the network can also be unfriendly , @xmath1 , the ising spin glass model",
    "should instead be considered @xcite .    in the part",
    "i of this work @xcite , we have introduced a general mapping between a given ising spin glass model and a related ising one ; the related ising model , which , roughly speaking , is the model in which the couplings are uniform .",
    "the mapping turns out to be of immediate application when the solution of this related ising model is known .",
    "the mapping becomes exact when the dimensionality of the system goes to infinite .",
    "more precisely , we have seen that : for a system having a number of first neighbors per vertex proportional to @xmath2 , the mapping applies exactly as @xmath3 ( _ infinite dimensional in a strict sense _ ) in all the paramagnetic region ; whereas , more in general , the mapping becomes an exact method to find the upper critical surface when , in the thermodynamic limit , the total number of infinitely long paths per vertex goes to infinite and , choosing randomly two of them , the probability that they overlap each other for an infinite number of bonds goes to zero ( _ infinite dimensional in a large sense _ ) . in @xcite we have applied the mapping to several models in which the above condition is satisfied , including , generalized sherrington - kirkpatrick models , which are infinite dimensional in a strict sense , and the spin glass model defined over the bethe lattice , which is infinite dimensional in the large sense .    in this paper",
    "we will apply the mapping to general graphs and networks which are infinite dimensional in the large sense .",
    "first , we will consider generalized static tree - like structures allowing also for a finite number of loops per vertex .",
    "second , we will analyze the case of random graphs where an ensemble of graphs @xmath4 , together with a probability @xmath5 , are given and all the graphs @xmath6 are infinite dimensional in the large sense , which , in particular , includes the so called `` equilibrium random graphs '' @xcite . in both the cases , we find very general formulae for the exact upper critical surface : parmagnetic - spin glass and paramagnetic - disordered ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic transitions .",
    "whereas for the generalized tree - like structures these critical surfaces are here for the first time given , we observe that , for the random graphs , the critical surfaces have been just derived , but confined to a particular subclass of the equilibrium random graphs @xcite . furthermore , beyond the equilibrium random graphs , we provide a formula which applies exactly in the most general case for networks whose bonds are each other independent random variables .",
    "this formula gives us the upper critical surface of the ising spin glass model in terms of the critical temperature of the ising model over the network , which , in general , has to be determined numerically , but , as a non random model , its measure turns out to be hugely easier than a direct measure for the spin glass model .",

    "in the subsection 5.1 , we recall the critical temperature of an ising model defined over an ensemble of random graphs , which , by using the mapping , will be used in the following subsection 5.2 to easily find the upper critical surface of a generic ising spin glass over an ensemble of random graphs . finally , some conclusions are reported in sec .",

    "@xcite , eqs .",

    "in the case of random graphs , an ensemble of graphs @xmath4 , together with a probability distribution @xmath90 for the elements @xmath6 of @xmath4 , are given .",
    "the free energy of a spin glass model defined over the ensemble @xmath4 is then evaluated as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the partition function of the quenched system in the graph @xmath6 with couplings @xmath93 .    in the following",
    ", we will apply explicitly the mapping to the so called `` equilibrium random graphs '' which are graphs maximally random under the constraint that the degree distribution of a vertex is a given one , @xmath94 ; @xmath95 being the number of connections of the vertex . for this family of graphs ( but not only ) the corresponding sets of links @xmath8 are infinite dimensional in the large sense .",
    "in fact , even if the number of infinitely length loops per vertex is infinite ( see , _ g.e .",
    "_ , @xcite and @xcite ) , due to the fact that the bonds are randomly distributed with the only constrain that they have to generate the given degree distribution @xmath94 , the probability that two of these loops overlap each other for an infinite number of bonds is zero .",
    "more in general , the elements of any ensemble @xmath4 are infinite dimensional in the large sense under the very weak condition for the distribution @xmath90 that the bonds are , each other , independent random variables .",
    "rather , the fact that the number of finite loops is infinite in certain scale free networks , has been recently raised as a possible doubt about the validity of the random tree approximation for the solution of the ising model on the equilibrium random graphs @xcite that we are about to recall in the following subsection .",
    "before to consider the ising spin glass over a random graph , we need to recall the general solution for the critical temperature of the ising model over equilibrium random graphs @xcite .",

    "therefore , if we neglect the correlations among the bonds , an ising model with coupling @xmath98 defined over the graph will have an effective distribution of couplings described by @xmath104 where @xmath105 according to eqs . ( [ hi]-[jib ] ) , the related ising model of this disorder model , whose disorder is given by eqs .",

    "therefore , if we now use the measure ( [ dmg ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ mapp01 ] ) , and @xmath107 for @xmath7 large , we find that the critical inverse temperature @xmath29 of the ising system over the random graph , is given by @xmath108 , which equals eq .",
    "( [ tig ] ) only in the case of the classical random graph , for which @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the error is due to having neglected the correlations among the bonds or , in other words , in assuming for @xmath110 a product measure . on the other hand , in a random graph",
    ", the distribution of the bonds do not follow the degree distribution of the vertices .",
    "in fact , as is known , the probability that a bond points to a node of degree @xmath95 is not @xmath94 , but @xmath111 .",
    "correspondingly , one expects that , as an effective calculation , in eq .",
    "( [ dmg ] ) the degree average of a vertex @xmath112 , should be substituted with the degree average of the end of a bond : @xmath113 .",
    "by implementing this substitution one arrives at @xmath114 , which constitutes a good approximation to the exact one ( [ tig ] ) @xcite .",
    "as pointed out above , in a random graph it is not possible to use an effective product measure @xmath110 which takes into account rigorously also of the degree distribution .",
    "however , for an exact treatment we can proceed as follows .",
    "let be given some disorder @xmath115 ( we consider here only the case of a same disorder for any bond ) .",
    "we observe that , in eq .",
    "( [ logzg ] ) , the averages with respect to @xmath110 and to @xmath90 are interchangeable , so that , if for any fixed graph @xmath6 we apply our mapping , ( see eqs .",

    "we have that , in the limit @xmath118 , the ensemble @xmath4 of the ising spin glass models can be effectively read as an ensemble @xmath4 of uniform ising models in which the parameters of the high temperature expansion are given by @xmath123 or @xmath124 , depending on which transition we are interested in . due to this ising - representation , by using eq .",

    "when the dimensionality of the set of links @xmath132 is infinite , the mapping is exact . in the present work ,",
    "we have applied such a mapping to the case of static generalized tree - like structures and networks .    since in a generalized tree - like structure",

    "we point out however , that , even if in these cases the analytical knowledge of the critical temperature of the ising model is absent , a direct numerical measure for it , turns out to be hugely easier than a direct measure for the critical temperature of the spin glass model .    by looking back at : eqs .",
