    "the fermion dispersion relation to one - loop order at high temperature has been studied several times in the literature @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation of a fermion , which gives its energy @xmath4 as it propagate through the medium as a function of its momentum @xmath5 , is very important in different kinds of physical situations @xcite and has been focused on various approximations and limits @xcite . during the last few years , there has been some controversy if the damping rate is gauge dependent or not and other problems @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that a proper resummation cures such problems found in most one - loop calculations @xcite .",
    "in fact , if one wants consistent results of damping rates at positive temperatures , it is crucial the use of methods like the well known hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummation of braaten and pisarski @xcite which employs resumed propagators and vertices and keep the correct order of the coupling constant .",
    "whith this method , braaten and pisarski has given in ref .",
    "@xcite a formal proof that resummation produces gauge - invariant results for the damping rates of quarks and gluons . in this article",
    "we reinvestigate the self - energy of massless fermions interacting with massless bosons at high temperature in the framework of the linear sigma model .",
    "this is the simpler , but instructive situation of fermions interacting with scalar and pseudoscalar fields .",
    "these are similar to yukawa couplings which has been discussed by m. thoma in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the htl ,",
    "thoma has found a kinematic restriction ( not observed in the case of quarks or gluons ) depending on the effective fermion and boson masses involved in the calculation of the damping rate of the fermion .",
    "more recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a fermion - scalar plasma has been considered in the context of real - time formulation and it was found that the yukawa fermions acquire a width through the induced decay of the scalar in the medium . here , as in @xcite , we use imaginary time formalism and calculate the fermion dispersion relation for interacting massless bosons and fermions in the limit @xmath6 and compute the fermion damping rate at rest , @xmath7 , for the case where the effective dressed ( induced by the thermal medium ) fermion and boson masses are consistently considered .    in a recent paper @xcite we proposed a modified self - consistent resummation ( mscr ) which resums higher - order terms in a non - perturbative way in order to cure the problem of breakdown of the perturbative expansion at finite temperature .",
    "we have applied the method up to one @xcite and two - loop @xcite order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "we have shown that the mscr , when applied to the study of the chiral fermion meson model , has the essential features which lead to the satisfaction of goldstone s theorem and renormalization of the uv divergences , in the low and high temperature regions .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the scheme breaks down around @xmath8 i.e. , in the region of intermediate temperatures , since quantum fluctuations are known to play a major role there . in this region",
    "higher - order terms in the perturbative expansion are required .",
    "it is well known that at high temperature the perturbative expansion can also be broken in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) or in massless field theories ( like qcd ) because powers of the temperature can compensate for powers of the coupling constant , even if the strength of the coupling is small @xcite . infrared divergence appears .",
    "when a set of infrared - divergent diagrams is summed up one gets an infrared - finite result .",
    "this is implemented in the mscr by the recalculation of the self - energy .",
    "a comparison between the mscr and the htl resummation methods showing its similarities and differences , which is out of the scope of this paper , is under preparation and will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "so , a motivation to study the fermion dispersion relation and damping rate at high temperature is the fact that the mscr showed itself an efficient method to execute the resummation in a divergence - free way in this region .",
    "thus , in the computation of the damping rate of the fermion , we shall use at the starting point the dressed by interaction boson mass obtained in @xcite rather than the zero mass parameter of the lagrangian . in this way , this calculation is interesting since it provides another simple example for the application of the mscr method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we study the fermion self - energy and obtain the dispersion relation of the fermion with some of its interesting limits . in section iii",
    "we compute the fermion damping rate at rest .",
    "section iv is devoted to conclusions .",
