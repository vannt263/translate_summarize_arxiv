    "assembling a complex quantum optical information processor requires precise knowledge of the properties of each of its components , i.e. , the ability to predict the effect of the components on an arbitrary input state .",
    "this gives rise to a quantum version of the famous black box problem ",
    ", which is addressed by means of _ quantum process tomography _ ( qpt ) @xcite . in qpt ,",
    "a set of probe states is sent into the black box ( here an unknown completely - positive , linear quantum process @xmath0 over the set of bounded operators @xmath1 on a hilbert space @xmath2 ) and the output states are measured . from the effect of the process on the probe",
    "states it is possible to predict its effect on any other state within the same hilbert space .",
    "qpt exploits linearity of quantum process over its density operators .",
    "if the effect of the process @xmath3 is known for a set of density operators @xmath4 , its effect on any linear combination @xmath5 equals @xmath6 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath4 forms a spanning set within the space @xmath7 of linear operators over a particular hilbert space @xmath2 , knowledge of @xmath8 is sufficient to extract complete information about the quantum process .",
    "however , practical implementations of qpt become demanding especially for systems with large hilbert spaces . for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which implies that at least @xmath11 unknown operators @xmath12 , each with @xmath11 unknown parameters , must be estimated .",
    "this procedure requires preparation of at least @xmath13 states , subjecting each to the unknown process @xmath0 , and determining each element of @xmath14 through measurement ( each with @xmath11 unknown elements ) , thereby inferring an overall number of @xmath15 parameters .",
    "furthermore , in order to build up sufficient statistics for reliable estimates of the output states , each measurement should be performed many times on multiple copies of the inputs .",
    "thus , a large number of realizations and measurements are required for complete tomography of @xmath0 .",
    "an additional complication , especially for qpt of quantum _ optical _ processes , is associated with preparation of the probe states .",
    "typical optical qpt implementations deal with systems consisting of one or more dual - rail qubits @xcite , which implies that the probe states are highly nonclassical , hence difficult to generate .",
    "these difficulties have been partially alleviated in the recently proposed scheme of coherent - state quantum process tomography \" ( csqpt ) @xcite .",
    "this scheme is based on the observation that the density operator @xmath16 of a generic quantum state of every electromagnetic mode can be expressed in the _ glauber - sudarshan representation _",
    "@xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a quasi - probability distribution referred to as the quantum state s @xmath19-function  and integrated over the entire complex plane @xcite .",
    "linearity hence implies that measuring @xmath20 i.e. , determining the effect of the unknown process on _ all _ coherent states enables a prediction of its effect upon any generic state @xmath16 according to @xmath21    the implementation of csqpt is advantageous because ( i ) coherent states are readily available from lasers , ( ii ) coherent states of different amplitudes and phases can be produced without changing the layout of the experimental apparatus , and ( iii ) output - state characterization can be performed using optical homodyne tomography @xcite , which obviates the need for postselection and provides full information about the process in question .",
    "moreover , csqpt has been tested experimentally on simple single - mode processes , such as the identity , attenuation , and phase shift operations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , csqpt has been used to characterize quantum memory for light based on electromagnetically - induced transparency @xcite .    an apparent obstacle to csqpt , however , is that the @xmath19 function for many nonclassical optical states exists only in terms of a highly singular generalized function @xcite .",
    "a remedy therefor is provided by klauder s theorem  @xcite , which states that any trace - class operator @xmath16 can be approximated , to arbitrary accuracy , by a bounded operator @xmath22 whose glauber - sudarshan function @xmath23 is in the schwartz class @xcite , so integration can be performed .",
    "the klauder approximation can be constructed by low - pass filtering of the @xmath19 function , i.e. , by multiplying its fourier transform with an appropriate regularizing function equal to @xmath24 over a square domain of size @xmath25 and rapidly dropping to zero outside this domain .",
    "@xcite employs this method to implement csqpt .",
    "practical implementation of klauder s procedure is however complicated , because it requires finding the characteristic function of the input state and subsequently its regularized @xmath19 function .",
    "this function features high - frequency , high - amplitude oscillations that limit the precision in calculating the output state .",
    "furthermore , klauder s approximation is ambiguous in the choice of the particular filtering function as well as the cutoff parameter @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "here we improve csqpt to overcome the above problems .",
    "specifically , we develop a new method for csqpt that eliminates the explicit use of the glauber - sudarshan representation and thus removes the inherent ambiguity associated with employing klauder s approximation for csqpt . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : csqpt - formalism ] , we obtain an expression for the process tensor in the fock ( photon number ) basis that can be directly calculated from the experimental data . using this tensor ,",
    "the process output for an arbitrary input can be calculated by simple matrix multiplication rather than requiring integration and high - frequency cut - offs . in this way ,",
    "transformations between the fock and glauber - sudarshan representations , which were necessary in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be sidestepped .",
    "using our new approach , we easily extend csqpt from its restrictive single - mode applicability to multi - mode processes and even to non - trace - preserving conditional processes .",
    "these extensions are particularly relevant for quantum information processing circuits , whose basic components are inherently multi - mode and conditional  @xcite .",
    "process tomography is successful if , for every input state , the estimate for the process output closely approximates the actual process output state , and the worst - case error of this estimate , given by a distance between the actual and estimated process outputs , is less than a given tolerance . for states over infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces ,",
    "this concept of error is however not meaningful because the finiteness of sampling implies that the process is necessarily under - sampled , hence can not be determined with bounded error .",
    "instead we could consider the process estimation restricted to a finite - dimensional _ subset _ of @xmath27 .",
    "this version of process tomography can always be successful with a sufficiently large amount of sampling .    of particular practical interest",
    "is the subspace @xmath28 defined by an energy cut - off , i.e. , estimating the process without accessing any information about its high - energy behavior .",
    "this restriction is naturally consistent with our choice to work in the fock basis , because then the resulting process tensor is of finite size and with many practical settings ( e.g. quantum - information processing with photonic qubits ) . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : erroranalysis ] , we provide process error estimates for several input state subsets that extend beyond @xmath29 .    many interesting processes are phase symmetric ; that is , an optical phase shift of the input state results in the same phase shift of the output .",
    "this property dramatically simplifies the experiment because one needs to collect data only for coherent states whose amplitudes lie on the real axis rather than the entire complex plane .",
    "this prompts us to discuss , in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimentalapplication ] , how to obtain the process tensor for phase - symmetric processes , which we test on the experimental data from ref .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we illustrate our method by analytically deriving the superoperators for certain fundamental quantum optical processes using the fock basis .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",

    "thus , by expressing input and output states in the fock basis , a quantum process can be uniquely represented and characterized by its rank-@xmath33 tensor , which relates the matrix elements of the output and input states according to @xmath34_{jk}=\\sum_{m , n\\in\\mathbb{n}_0 } \\mathcal{e}^{mn}_{jk}\\rho_{mn } , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",

    "the above formalism is not restricted to trace - preserving quantum processes .",
    "indeed , trace preservation was not required in the derivation of our results .",
    "thus , our method is applicable to all quantum optical processes that are mathematically described by completely - positive maps , but may be trace - preserving , trace - reducing or even trace - increasing .",
    "trace - nonpreserving quantum processes are either _ conditional processes _ or part of a larger process @xmath65 , which is trace - preserving as a whole , but whose components @xmath66 and @xmath67 may increase or decrease the trace , respectively .",
