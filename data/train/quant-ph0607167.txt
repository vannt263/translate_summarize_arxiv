    "entanglement witnesses have proven tremendously helpful in the experimental characterization of entanglement in composite quantum systems [ 113 ] .",
    "they are observables from the expectation values of which one can argue whether a prepared state is indeed entangled : whenever its expectation value takes a value smaller than zero , then one can unambiguously draw the conclusion that the state has been entangled in a particular fashion [ 14 ] : the entanglement has then been `` witnessed '' .",
    "this approach seems particularly feasible or helpful in situations where one would like to avoid to collect sufficient data to arrive at full tomographic knowledge . specifically in multi - partite settings when detecting multi - particle entanglement this can be costly .",
    "also in instances one can tolerate larger errors when estimating entanglement witnesses compared to the procedure where one first estimates the full state .",
    "originally , such a test for entanglement was thought to give rise to an answer to a `` yes - no - question '' : the state is entangled or it is not . yet , in this way , one does not make use of valuable information that one has collected anyway .",
    "actually , one has implicitly recorded data that are sufficient to make a _ quantitative _ statement : if a test is very much violated  so delivers a value much smaller than zero  then one can infer that in quantitative terms , the state was highly entangled .",
    "this quantitative statement is then meant in terms of some measure of entanglement .",
    "this is very useful information : one does not only know that the the specific entanglement property is contained in the state .",
    "but one can also give an answer to the question how useful a given state is , say , to perform a certain task of quantum information .",
    "this article emphasizes this fact , and advocates the paradigm of quantitative tests based on data from measuring witness operators @xcite .",
    "needless to say , one should under all circumstances only make use of the data that have in fact been acquired in an experiment , and avoid hidden assumptions concerning the nature of the involved states .",
    "but then , in turn , one should make use of the full information that can in fact be extracted from the measurement data , including quantitative assessments .",
    "the paradigm we describe is the following : imagine one has collected data from a measurement of an _ entanglement witness _ , or a collection thereof .",
    "what is the worst case scenario one could have had , concerning the degree of entanglement ?",
    "certainly , one should provide conservative estimates in this context .",
    "this is typically the practically most relevant question : one has prepared a state , and wants to know to what degree one has succeeded in doing so .",
    "this test should make use of a minimal possible number of data , or measurement settings , certainly less than full tomography .",
    "so we aim for answers to +    @xmath0    _ `` given measurement data from measuring an entanglement witness , which one is quantitatively the least entangled state consistent with the data ? '' _",
    "+    this translates to an _ optimization problem _ : for a given measure of bi - partite or multi - partite entanglement @xmath1 , we aim at finding the solution of @xmath2 or at least get reasonably good lower bounds",
    ". the general spirit of this paper will be to assume nothing more than the partial information provided by expectation values of entanglement witnesses .",
    "based on this information , we aim at finding good bounds to entanglement measures",
    ". we also comment on the tightness of these bounds .",
    "in fact , the provided strategies often give rise to the best ( tightest ) possible bounds based on this partial information .",
    "the `` true state '' of the system is not assumed to be known , or it is not even assumed that it could in principle be measured , as full quantum tomography may be inaccessible . in turn , the _ optimization of entanglement witnesses _ , so the construction of tangent hyperplanes [ 11 , 12 , 1619 ] is an interesting ( and computationally provably hard ) problem in its own right , which we will not touch upon here . any known findings in this field can however immediately be applied to our setting , in that the entanglement witness that is most violated will give rise to the best bound .",
    "we hence take the entanglement witness as such and the corresponding data for granted , and will provide good bounds for entanglement measures based on them .",
    "this is actually the situation one faces when interpreting experimental data .",
    "there is a body of work somewhat similar in spirit in the literature .",
    "the need for conservative estimates , so for minimizing the degree of entanglement in the context of a jaynes statistical inference scheme consistent with the data was already noted in the early work ref .",

    "we consider the bi - partite and multi - partite setting .",

    "[ 2326 ] . in this paper , we refrain from introducing these multi - partite entanglement classes , and refer for that to refs .",
    "[ 2730 ] .",
    "we should mention at this point that if one allows for witnesses taking several identically prepared specimens into account , one can often improve the bounds to entanglement measures . on the positive side , this gives rise to sharper or tight bounds , often making use of few different types of measurements , or indeed even single ones [ 3135 ] . on the negative side",
    ", one needs to implement collective operations , either with quantum networks , or in optical settings , with joint operations involving bringing together independent sources at beam splitters .",
    "nonetheless , the first experimental measurements of a two - copy witness for arbitrary two qubit pure states was recently reported @xcite .",
    "although we make the presented ideas explicit for the most frequently applied approach of measurements on individual specimens , it should be noted that many of the presented ideas are also applicable to this case of collective operations .",
    "subsequently , we will present a framework of quantitative tests , and discuss a number of bounds for different entanglement measures .",
    "we will also discuss several examples , taken from the bi - partite and multi - partite context .",
    "the concept of the conjugate function will play a central role here .      in this first part we consider bi - partite _ splits _ of our system : so the system is either naturally bi - partite , or we group the subsystems into two parts , with joint hilbert space @xmath16 , with state space @xmath17 .",
    "the _ negativity _ is a measure of entanglement defined as @xmath18 in terms of the trace - norm @xmath19 .",

    "but for the use of this criterion as such , one does no longer have to solve any optimization problem .    at this point ,",
    "a remark is in order concerning the tightness of the constructed bounds .",
    "let @xmath20 be the partial transpose of a state on @xmath38 , @xmath39 eigenvalues of which are strictly positive , @xmath40 eigenvalues are strictly negative , and @xmath41 eigenvalues take the value @xmath42 . then any @xmath26 satisfying @xmath43\\ ] ] has a spectrum containing at least @xmath39 times the value @xmath44 and @xmath40 times the value @xmath45 . in our present context",

    "then the bound is just saturated by actual physical states .     as a very simple example , consider states on @xmath51 .",
    "the witness we take is @xmath52 which is an optimal entanglement witness , in that it is tangent to the set of separable states . here and in the following",
    ", @xmath53 and @xmath54 denotes the state vectors of the familiar _ bell states _ for two qubits .",
    "now consider @xmath55 , so @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 clearly satisfies @xmath58 .",
    "then , whenever we get a value @xmath59 = c$ ] , we can assert that @xmath60 it is also easy to see that this bound is tight : the spectrum of @xmath26 is given by @xmath61 .",
    "a family of states saturating the bound is given by @xmath62 for which @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath64 , the only state consistent with this value is the maximally entangled state @xmath65 , yielding @xmath66 .    in turn",
    ", we can see what we may gain from using two witnesses :    let us take the two entanglement witnesses @xmath67 , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "then , we may evaluate the optimal bound based on each witness separately , and the best bound based on both simultaneously . from solving the semi - definite optimization problem",
    ", we find in case of @xmath72 , @xmath73 then for @xmath74 , @xmath75 indeed , in the combined case using @xmath76 and @xmath74 , we obtain the better bound @xmath77",
    "this shows that the suitable processing of several witnesses at the same time can give rise to optimized bounds .",
    "the bound arising from the data from two witnesses is stronger than each bound resulting from either of them .",
    "the presented bounds are based on simple witnesses for qubit systems , but it should be clear that the construction is general enough such that bounds can be identified in fact for arbitrary entanglement witnesses in any dimension .",

    ", we do not have to evaluate the convex hull explicitly .    moreover , the bounds constructed in this way are always tight .",

    "@xcite is exactly such a quantity . in the framework of eq .",
