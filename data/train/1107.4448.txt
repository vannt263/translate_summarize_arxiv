    "spintronics brought to the center of the scientific research new materials with exotic properties @xcite .",
    "the latest addition to these materials are the so - called multiferroics which combine several ferroic orders like ferromagnetism , ferroelectricity , ferroelasticity etc @xcite",
    ". among them exist some compounds which combine electric and magnetic order exhibiting the magnetoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "these alloys have several potential applications like magnetic - field sensors and electric - write magnetic - read random - access memories @xcite .",
    "magnetic order and ferroelectricity have different origins @xcite and thus the materials exhibiting the magnetoelectric effect are few and the coupling between the magnetic and electric properties is weak .",
    "an alternative route to achieve a strong coupling could be the growth of thin film heterostructures and several advances have been made towards the magnetic control of ferroelectricity @xcite and the electric control of thin film magnetism @xcite .    among the most studied single - component multiferroic compounds",
    "are the bismuth ferrite and the bismuth manganite , bifeo@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 .",
    "bulk bifeo@xmath0 crystallizes in a perovskite - like pseudocubic structure instead of a ferrite one @xcite and bulk bimno@xmath0 prefers a monoclinic lattice @xcite .",
    "bifeo@xmath0 is a ferroelectric g - type antiferromagnet @xcite while bimno@xmath0 is a ferromagnet presenting no net spontaneous polarization @xcite .",
    "a jahn - teller distortion corresponding to an elongation of the oxygen octahedron surrounding the mn atom induces a polar order in bimno@xmath0 and g - type antiferromagnetism appears as in bifeo@xmath0 ; this new multiferroic state is close in energy to the ferromagnetic non - polar ground state @xcite .",
    "several first - principles calculations have been carried out to study the properties of both bulk bifeo@xmath0 @xcite and bimno@xmath0 compounds @xcite .",
    "we refer readers to ref . for an overview of the literature on both compounds .",
    "since the single - component crystals like bifeo@xmath0 present only a weak magnetoelectric effect , an alternative route to achieve a more strong effect has been proposed to be the growth of heterostructures where epitaxial strain can enhance the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "doping has been also proposed to enhance the performance of such structures @xcite .",
    "towards such heterostructures , multilayers consisting of alternating layers of bifeo@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 have been proposed where the ferroelectricity of bifeo@xmath0 couples to the ferromagnetic order in bimno@xmath0 through epitaxial strain and a nanoscale checkboard from first - principles has been recently proposed for several lattice structures @xcite .",
    "simple doping of bifeo@xmath0 with mn leads to an antiferromagnetic coupling of the mn spin moments to the fe ones @xcite .    in a recent publication ( ref . )",
    "we have presented extended first - principles calculations , employing the quantum - espresso @xcite ab - initio electronic structure method in conjunction with the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - erzenhof formulation @xcite , on the electronic and magnetic properties of bifeo@xmath0 alloy as a function of the lattice constant in the case of the cubic perovskite structure ( see figure 1 in ref . ) , where the heavy cations ( bi ) occupy the corners of the cube , oxygen atoms the center of the faces and the fe atom is at the center of the cube .",
    "fe atoms alone form a cubic cell and the considered 2@xmath42 unit cell in our calculations contained eight primitive cells and thus eight fe atoms .",
    "we studied four possible magnetic arrangements : one ferromagnetic ( f - type ) and three antiferromagnetic ( a - type , c - type and g - type ) .",
    "we found that all four types of magnetic order are close in energy and for a lattice constant of the primitive cell larger than 3.888   the g - type antiferromagnetism becomes more stable than the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) and the spin magnetic moments of the fe atoms , which are responsible for the magnetic properties , showed similar behavior in all possible magnetic states since magnetic interactions are mediated by oxygen atoms .",
    "bi atoms showed no contribution to magnetism while the magnetic properties of the oxygen atoms depended strongly on their local environment since they are located at the midpoints between neighboring iron atoms .",
    "mnfeo@xmath2 form a cubic lattice .",
    "in ( a ) we present the three distributions of mn and fe atoms which we considered and in ( b ) the possible magnetic configurations ( vectors pointing up correspond to positive spin magnetic moments and vectors pointing down to negative moments ) .",
    "notice that there are now two possible a - type antiferromagnetic structures : ( i ) a1 where atoms belonging to neighboring planes along the [ 001 ] direction have antiparallel spin magnetic moments , and ( ii ) a2 when this occurs along the [ 100 ] directions .",
    "for the same reason there are two c - type antiferromagnetic configurations along the [ 110 ] ( c1 ) and along the [ 101 ] ( c2 ) directions . [ fig1 ] ]    we expand the study in ref .",
    "to cover also the case of mn substitution for fe in bifeo@xmath0 motivated by the work in ref . since the coexistence of fe and mn cations seems to lead to new multiferroic materials",
    "we have concentrated our interest on the electronic and magnetic properties of the resulting compounds employing the same electronic structure method as in ref . and calculations details are similar .",
    "we have chosen to study a case with equal number of fe and mn atoms ( denoted as bi@xmath1mnfeo@xmath2 ) using the same 2@xmath42 unit cell as in ref . .",
    "thus now we have four fe atoms and four mn atoms per unit cell .",
    "there are several ways to distribute the fe and mn atoms and in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the three cases which we have considered . in the i - case",
    "we have a layered structure consisting of alternating pure fe and pure mn layers along the [ 001 ] direction . in the ii - case",
    "we have alternating pure fe and pure mn layers along the [ 110 ] direction and in iii - case along the [ 111 ] direction . in i",
    "- case each fe(mn ) atom has four fe(mn ) and two mn(fe ) atom as nearest transition - metal neighbors while in ii - case each fe(mn ) atom has two fe(mn ) and four mn(fe ) atom as nearest transition - metal neighbors .",
    "in iii - case each atom has six neighbors of the other chemical species .",
    "for our calculations we have used a lattice constant of 3.888   for the primitive unit cell in fig . 1 of ref . which is the calculated equilibrium lattice constant for bifeo@xmath0 in .",
    "moreover due to the lower symmetry there is for bi@xmath1mnfeo@xmath2 a larger number of possible magnetic configurations with respect to bifeo@xmath0 which are presented in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "arrows indicate the orientation of the spin magnetic moments of fe and mn atoms at the corners of the cube .",
    "f corresponds to the ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "there are two types of a - antiferromagnetism ; in the a1-type all atoms within a ( 001 ) layer are coupled ferromagnetically but successive layers along the [ 001 ] direction are coupled antiferromagnetically between them while in the a2-type this concerns the layers along the [ 100 ] direction . c1- and c2-types of antiferromagnetism describe antiferromagnetic coupling of successive layers along the [ 110 ] and [ 101 ] directions , respectively . finally g - type antiferromagnetism is characterized by alternation of the orientation of the spin magnetic moments along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "we should note here that for the iii - case of the distribution of fe and mn atoms , the symmetry is higher and the [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] directions are equivalent and the same stands also for the [ 110 ] and [ 101 ] orientations .",
    "thus for this case a1 and a2 as well as c1 and c2 are degenerate . in the next section we present our calculated results .",
    "we have also calculated the case of bimno@xmath0 similar to bifeo@xmath0 in ref . as reference and at the end of the next section we also present shortly results for a smaller lattice constant of 3.703 corresponding to a contraction of the lattice of about 4.8 % . in the last section",
    "we conclude and summarize our results .",
    ".absolute values of the atom - resolved spin magnetic moments in @xmath3 for all cases and for all magnetic configurations under study .",
    "results are for a lattice constant of the primitive unit cell ( see fig . 1 in ref . ) of 14.7 a.u .",
    "( 3.888  ) . in case",
    "iii the a1 and a2 structures are equivalent due to symmetry reasons and the same is valid also for the c1 and c2 configurations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we expand our study in ref . to the case of bi@xmath1mnfeo@xmath2 alloys .",
    "first we have studied the bimno@xmath0 alloy for various magnetic configurations and we have shown that , as was the case for bifeo@xmath0 , mn atoms exhibit high values of their spin magnetic moment , the magnitude of which exceeds the 3 @xmath3 in all cases under study . the small difference between the fe and mn spin magnetic moments can be easily explained by the position of the e@xmath5 states with respect to the t@xmath6 states which lie lower in energy due to the crystal field effect .",
    "we took into account three different possible distributions for the fe and mn atoms in bi@xmath1mnfeo@xmath2 and studied one ferromagnetic and five possible antiferromagnetic alignments of the spin magnetic moments . both fe- and",
    "mn - resolved magnetic and electronic properties are only marginal sensitive to the various distributions of the atoms and show properties close to fe and mn atoms in the parent bifeo@xmath0 and bimno@xmath0 alloys , respectively .",
    "also among the various magnetic configurations the spin moments show small variation and their magnitude is always larger than 3 @xmath3 .",
    "thus oxygen atoms which are the nearest - neighbors of fe(mn ) atoms play a crucial role since they mediate the magnetic interactions between the transition metal atoms and they screen any change in their environment . finally we have shown that contracting the lattice leads to a large decrease in the spin magnetic moments of the fe atoms as in bifeo@xmath0 studied in ref . while the mn atoms retain a large portion of their spin magnetic moment .",
