    "since exciton - polaritons in semiconductor microcavities posses very light effective mass , there has been a large interest in recent years in realising polariton bec  @xcite .",
    "so far , however , experiments concentrate on a very low density regime , in which a clear polariton splitting in a normal state is measured .",
    "although the physical picture of polariton condensation is more complex at higher densities , recent works suggest that the fermionic structure of excitons does not prevent condensation and moreover , at higher densities , the condensate becomes more robust to pair - breaking decoherence and disorder , real antagonists of condensation @xcite . in the absence of disorder , even at high excitation densities , a strongly coupled light - matter condensate can be realised and it is only a strong influence of the environment ( all other processes other than dipole interaction ) which leads to a weak light - matter coupling characteristic of a laser and governed by a fermi golden rule .",
    "the laser regime emerges from the polariton condensate at high densities when pair - breaking disorder or decoherence is large in a way similar to gapless superconductivity and it arises because these processes destroy the electronic polarisation leaving the photon component unchanged .",
    "this conclusion and several other properties of polariton condensate has been shown to be independent on whether the excitons are propagating or localised .",
    "two models have been recently considered , where the condensation of cavity polaritons and the crossover to a laser regime is not restricted by the assumption on the bosonic nature of polaritons  @xcite , or , in other words , by the low density limit . in the first one  @xcite , direct two band excitons in a disordered quantum well",
    "are affected by coulomb interaction and are dipole coupled to the cavity light . in the second one , instead , excitons are localised , e.g. by disorder , and described as two - level oscillators coupled to light  @xcite . here",
    ", decoherence effects can be introduced by coupling the system to external baths  @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to show and explain that similar conclusions can be drawn from both approaches . as far as some of the assumptions are concerned , the two models are in fact complementary ( see the table  [ tab : table ] ) .",
    "firstly , while in the first one dispersion of electrons and holes is included , in the second one only the presence or absence of localised excitons is taken into account . as a result ,",
    "coulomb interaction and screening at high excitonic densities is self - consistently included in the band model , while in the two - level oscillators version only the on - site coulomb interaction is taken into account .",
    "secondly , because of technical restrictions , we limit the analysis of the band model to the high density regime , while in the two - level systems model all range of excitation densities is analysed . recently , a study of the bec - bcs crossover in this model has been accomplished  @xcite .",
    "finally , while in one case we study the effect of a pair - breaking disorder potential , in the other case the role of decoherence is considered . though conceptually very different , the two mechanisms have a similar influence on the condensation of the electron - hole / photon system in the cavity and both , when large , drive it towards the lasing regime . since the principal aim has been the study of the influence of decoherence and disorder on the condensation , both models assume thermal equilibrium which correspond to such a physical situation when thermalization rate is larger than the pumping and decay rates .",
    "band dispersion & exciton localisation + coulomb interaction and screening & on - site coulomb interaction and phase space filling + dipole coupling to light & dipole coupling to light + non - pair - breaking disorder & inhomogeneous broadening of exciton energies + pair - breaking disorder & decoherence ( coupling to external baths ) +    the paper is organised as follows : the main results relative to each model are respectively delineated in the next two sections , while a comparison is described in the concluding one .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coupled electron - hole / photon system can be separated in the following components : @xmath0 the hamiltonian @xmath1 represents the interacting hamiltonian for a direct - gap semiconducting quantum well : @xmath2 where the middle of the gap @xmath3 is taken as the energy reference and where @xmath4 is the total electron density operator ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 create an electron with momentum @xmath7 respectively in the conductance and valence band ) . without loss of generality , we assume electrons and holes to have the same mass @xmath8 . in the high density regime of electrons and holes @xmath9 ( @xmath10 denotes the real density of electrons and holes and @xmath11 the excitonic bohr radius ) , coulomb interaction , @xmath12 $ ] is screened due to both electrons and holes and , in two dimensions , the screening length is set by the bohr radius , @xmath13 .",
    "hence , in this limit , the coulomb interaction can be replaced by a short range contact interaction  @xcite , where the coupling constant , @xmath14 , will be a decreasing function of the increasing total density of excitations , @xmath15  . applying a self - consistent hartree - fock treatment ,",
    "the coulomb quartic interaction can be decoupled by means of the excitonic order parameter or polarisation field , @xmath16 .",
    "note that ordinary hartree - fock pairings , while crucial in the low - density limit , effect only a small renormalisation of the single - particle energy .",
    "therefore , the system shows a bcs - like instability around the fermi surface , @xmath17 , and the condensation in the exciton insulator state is signalled by the opening of a gap equal to @xmath18  @xcite .     and @xmath19 ( solid and dashed ) . the boundary between the condensed gapped and gapless region for @xmath20 ( dotted )",
    "is shown for comparison ( in this case the regime where the bcs description loses validity starts at @xmath21 ) . ]",
    "the second term in   describes the impurity potentials : @xmath22 b^\\dag ( { { \\mathbf r } } ) b ( { { \\mathbf r } } )    \\right . \\\\",
    "+ \\left[u_c ( { { \\mathbf r } } ) - u_n ( { { \\mathbf r}})\\right]a^\\dag    ( { { \\mathbf r } } ) a ( { { \\mathbf r}})\\right\\ } \\ ; . \\label{eq : poten}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] variations in the width of the quantum well through atomic terracing , strain fields and so on , induce a ` charge - neutral ' potential @xmath23 that act on electrons and holes with the same sign and , if weak , does not affect the integrity of the condensate phase .",
    "in contrast , the asymmetric ` charged ' component @xmath24 describes alloy impurities and presents a pair - breaking perturbation which gradually destroys the excitonic condensate . in both cases ,",
    "we suppose that the potentials @xmath25 are drawn at random from a gaussian white - noise distribution , with zero mean and variance , @xmath26 , proportional to the associated inverse scattering times , @xmath27 , where @xmath28",
    ". the pair - breaking scattering time can be as well interpreted as the time after which the relative phase of an excitonic pair is randomised . in the limit of weak disorder ,",
    "multiple scattering processes from a single impurity are suppressed and the system can be treated within the self - consistent born approximation  note that while the consideration of unitarity limit scatterers would change the results quantitatively , the qualitative conclusions of the present analysis remain valid . here , the effect of pair - breaking disorder on the integrity of the exciton insulator phase ( i.e. in absence of photon interaction ) has been explored in an early work by zittartz  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonians describing free photons in the cavity and the dipole coupling to the electron - hole system are respectively given by @xmath29    \\psi_{{{\\mathbf p } } } \\\\",
    "\\hat{\\mathcal{h}}_{\\text{int } } & = g \\int d{{\\mathbf r}}\\left[\\psi    ( { { \\mathbf r } } ) b^\\dag ( { { \\mathbf r } } ) a ( { { \\mathbf r } } ) + \\text{h.c.}\\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the dispersion @xmath30 is quantised in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the cavity mirrors .",
    "we notice that the decoupling of coulomb interaction through the excitonic order parameter has place in the same channel as the coupling to photon .",
    "therefore , at mean - field level , the condensate of the polariton system is characterised by an order parameter which is a combination of the polarisation and photon amplitudes , @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , one can show the following constraint has to be verified  @xcite @xmath32 which leads to the following renormalised pairing interaction , @xmath33 : @xmath34 as a consequence , in the mean - field approximation and in absence of disorder , the condensation is described in bcs terms , where the interplay between electron - hole and photon excitations is contained in the effective coupling constant , @xmath35 , and in the chemical potential , @xmath36 .",
    "finally , we will suppose that the electron - hole / photon system is held in quasi - equilibrium by tuning the chemical potential in   to fix the total number of excitations @xmath37 where the density of excitations will be indicated with @xmath38 .",
    "however , how the system chooses to portion the excitations between the electron - hole and photon degrees of freedom depends sensitively on the properties of the condensate .",
    "in particular , in the clean limit , it is easy to see that when the density @xmath39 is low , the majority of the excitations are invested in electrons and holes and therefore the density increases linearly with the chemical potential . here ,",
    "provided the density is large enough to keep the particles unbound , the condensed phase is reminiscent of the exciton insulator one , even if a small fraction of photons do contribute to the condensate .",
    "therefore , in this regime the zero temperature phase diagram ( see figure  [ fig : phase ] ) mimics the behaviour of the symmetry broken exciton insulator : at a fixed value of disorder , the amplitude of the order parameter decreases increasing the density because of the coulomb interaction screening .",
    "when the scattering rate @xmath40 is comparable to the value of the unperturbed order parameter , the system enters a gapless phase before the condensate is extinguished altogether .",
    "further , adding more excitations into the system , eventually , as the chemical potential approaches the band edge , @xmath41 , the photons are brought into resonance and the character of the condensate changes abruptly .",
    "screening suppresses the excitonic coupling constant @xmath14 and at the same time the photon effective coupling constant @xmath42 grows in size . here",
    ", the excitations become increasingly photon - like , with @xmath15 diverging exponentially when the chemical potential converges on @xmath41  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the condensate becomes more and more robust against the disorder potential until , eventually , the complete quenching of coherence is inhibited .",
    "interestingly , however , the residual effect of the disorder leaves open the possibility of a substantial region of the phase diagram where the system is gapless .",
    "here , the condensate manifests the conventional properties of a semiconductor laser  i.e. a substantial coherent optical field , but a gapless spectrum of electron - hole pairs with negligible electronic polarisation .",
    "however , at sufficiently large densities , the photon - dominated order parameter becomes comparable with the fermi energy and the bcs - type description loses its validity .",
    "measuring energies in units of the rydberg ( @xmath43 ) , the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] is characterised by the total excitation density ( @xmath39 ) , the disorder strength ( @xmath44 ) , the dimensionless photon coupling strength @xmath45 and the dimensionless coulomb coupling strength , which , fixing the thickness of the quantum well of the order of the bohr radius @xmath46 , is a function of @xmath47 , in particular @xmath48^{-1/2}$ ] . here",
    ", the parameter @xmath49 characterises the crossover between the electron / hole and the photon dominated region , which is approximatively given by @xmath50 .",
    "this is the density of electronic excitations , which , in absence of photons , can be reached when the chemical potential is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , fixing the value of @xmath51 , variations in the coupling @xmath52 bring small changes in the electron / hole dominated region , while , for example decreasing its value as shown in figure  [ fig : phase ] , it brings to a strong enhancement of the gapless region .",
    "note as well that diminishing the value of @xmath52 pushes the strong coupling region to higher densities .",
    "when the charged component of the disorder potential is negligible , while the neutral component is strong enough to localise the excitons , a simple model describing @xmath53 localised excitons can be rewritten as @xmath54 while the coupling to photons , @xmath55 , remains unchanged .",
    "as before , the system is described by two order parameters , the coherent photon field and the polarisation , with the difference that , since coulomb interaction is contained in the on - site energies @xmath56 , the polarisation does not have to be self - consistently determined , but it is locked to the photon field by the relation  . again",
    "the values of the order parameters depend on the density of excitations , @xmath57 , or equivalently on the chemical potential , @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , one can introduce dephasing processes , coupling the system   to external baths @xcite : @xmath58 here , our interest is restricted to processes which do not change the total number of excitations in the cavity , @xmath59 , as , for example , collisions with phonons . analogously to disorder in the previous model  , decoherence processes can be divided into non - pair - breaking ( @xmath60 ) and pair - breaking ( @xmath61 ) ones .",
    ", while the lower curves are for detuning @xmath62 , where the photon field is above the exciton line by an energy equal to the dipole coupling .",
    "]    the degrees of freedom of the bath , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , can be integrated out , inducing a quartic interaction between different two - level systems , which , similarly to how disorder has been treated in the previous model , can be analysed within a self - consistent born approximation .",
    "the main difference lies in the fact that disorder is static , while the baths are characterised by a dynamics .",
    "however , for simplicity , one can assume a static limit , in which the bath is characterised by only one frequency , e.g. the lowest one .",
    "in this case the decoherence parameter for , say , the pair - breaking term , will be indicated with @xmath65 . in the opposite limit instead , one can assume each mode of the bath oscillating independently from the other ones . in this limit , called markovian approximation , as for the previous one , the mean - field equations admit an analytical solution . here",
    "we will refer to the first case .    in absence of decoherence",
    ", the minimum @xmath66 corresponds to the case where there are no photons and no electronic excitations . at low excitation densities , where @xmath67 , the usual bosonic polaritons limit is preserved , while away from the minimum the condensate gradually becomes more photon - like ,",
    "the phase space filling effect of the fermionic states start to become relevant and the bosonic picture breaks down  @xcite . in the absence of dephasing , however , even at high excitation densities , the ground state of the system is a strongly coupled light - matter condensate with a large gap in the excitation spectrum , i.e. the incoherent luminescence , very different from a laser .",
    "the influence of the pair - breaking decoherence on the condensate in this model  @xcite is similar to the influence of the pair - breaking disorder in the band model described in the previous section .",
    "this is manifested in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phas1 ] . the dephasing processes lead to a suppression of the electronic polarisation and the gap in the excitation spectrum . at very low excitation densities and low decoherence",
    "there is a gapped condensate with photon and exciton components comparable in size .",
    "as the decoherence is increased , the system reaches a narrow gapless region and finally there is a complete suppression of the coherent fields . as the excitation density is increased , the gapless region becomes larger .",
    "for sufficiently large excitations , the coherent fields are present even in the presence of very large dephasing . in this regime",
    "the condensate is almost entirely photon - like with very small excitonic polarisation and the spectrum is gapless , reminiscent of the laser .",
    "in contrast , non - pair - breaking processes which give rise to inhomogeneous broadening of exciton energies have much weaker , only qualitative , influence on the coherent fields and do not cause any transitions .",
    "a comparison between the models described in the previous two sections can now be drawn . despite the fact the two approaches start from different assumptions on the nature of the excitons , they share the main results and in particular exhibit a very similar phase diagram .",
    "first of all , the description of the condensate in both cases is done in terms of an order parameter to which both excitonic and photonic excitations contribute . in the first model the polarisation field derives from the self - consistent decoupling of coulomb interaction , and , at mean - field level ,",
    "is locked to the photon field by the relation  , which similarly has place for the second model .",
    "secondly , in both cases , increasing the density of excitations , the electron - hole dominated region precedes the one dominated by photons . while , due to a combination of screening of coulomb interaction and a resonance mechanism when the chemical potential reaches the cavity frequency @xmath41 in the first case , in the second one this is due to the space filling effect of the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "either way , this circumstance causes the pair - breaking disorder from one side and the pair - breaking ( static ) decoherence processes from the other one to act very similarly on the condensate : complete quenching of the condensate and therefore loss of coherence in the system by pair - breaking mechanisms is possible only in the electron - hole dominated region , while , above a certain density threshold , coherence is preserved and strong pair - breaking effects drive the system into a gapless regime , where there is no coherence in the excitonic component of the order parameter but only in the photonic one . here , the system exhibits the characteristic of a conventional laser .",
    "note that , because of screening , in the band model the condensed region in the electron - hole dominated region is reduced by the increase of the density , while this effect is absent in the two - level systems model .",
    "there are several important issues not yet considered here",
    ". how would the phase diagram look like in the presence of realistic band - limited decoherence characteristic , for example , for acoustic phonons ?",
    "moreover , beyond the mean - field approximation , while the effect of fluctuations and the spectrum of collective excitations has been analysed within the band model  @xcite and in the two level systems one without decoherence  @xcite , a similar study in presence of decoherence will be the subject of further investigations .    from the analysis above we",
    "can therefore conclude that , regardless whether excitons are propagating or localised , high densities do not preclude polariton condensation . on the contrary , since the gap in the density of state is proportional to the coherent field amplitude , the condensate becomes more robust at high densities .",
