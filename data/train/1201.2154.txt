    "<S> we hypothesize that the computed tep is substantially larger than the intrinsic chain - axis value because the measured @xmath68 in lmo is suppressed by the occurrence of incomplete electrical connectivity of the mo - o chains . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis is motivated by the hall data implying a large fraction of localized carriers , and the observation of a large constant term in @xmath69 ( @xmath70  w / mk ) at @xmath71  k [ inset , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nernstvst](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is attributed to electronic heat conduction . </S>",
    "<S> poor connectivity will substantially suppress the measured @xmath68 from that of continuous chains , whereas electronic heat conduction on chain fragments will continue to contribute given that heat is transferred readily to the lattice . supporting this picture , </S>",
    "<S> the constant term in @xmath72 varies little among several other crystals with varying @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is appealing because it can simultaneously account for the large fraction of total charge that is localized and the different values for the anisotropy ratio @xmath73 reported in the literature @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the measured thermoelectric coefficients reflect appropriate bulk averages , weighing voltage contributions from short and long chain fragments according to local temperature differences . </S>",
    "<S> thus the intrinsic chain thermoelectric behavior must be closest to that of the most conducting specimen c , having the largest value of @xmath47 and smallest of the tep ( the most closely compensated ) . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from particle - hole symmetry and increased carrier localization characterizing more oxygenated crystals presumably reflect the combined effects of charge doping and disorder associated with oxygen defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic system of lmo is most one - dimensional at high @xmath32 where the thermal energy exceeds the transverse hopping energy ( @xmath82 ) that determines the warping of the fs sheets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the regime where a conventional phonon - drag mechanism is least likely to explain the large thermoelectric coefficients since anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering should limit momentum transfer to the electron system , rendering phonon drag negligible . </S>",

    "<S> it is difficult to assess the possible relevance of luttinger physics . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical treatments of the thermopower for single luttinger chains with impurity scattering @xcite indicate a linear temperature dependence , inconsistent with the present results . </S>",
    "<S> more realistic models including electron - electron umklapp scattering and coupled chains ( essential for the nernst effect ) have not been treated to our knowledge . at @xmath83 , where higher - dimensional behavior is manifested in unconventional density - wave order @xcite and the appearance of superconductivity , </S>",

    "<S> is found to have a bipolar nernst coefficient that is among the largest known for metals and far exceeds the expected contribution from carrier diffusion over a broad temperature range . though phonon drag appears capable of accounting for this discrepancy at the lowest @xmath32 , low - dimensional physics of the electronic and/or lattice systems may be important to a complete understanding of its enhanced thermoelectric coefficients .    </S>",
