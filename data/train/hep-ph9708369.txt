    "in supergravity models with a low supersymmetry breaking scale , the gravitino ( @xmath5 ) mass is in the superlight range of @xmath0 ev to few kev s since it is given by the formula @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the scale of supersymmetry breaking and @xmath8 is the planck mass that characterises the gravitational interactions . )",
    "any information on the gravitino mass therefore translates into knowledge of one of the most fundamental parameters of particle physics , the scale at which supersymmetry breaks .",
    "there is an advantages in studying the gravitino s properties when its mass is in the superlight range because it can be easily emitted in astrophysical processes such as supernova cooling@xcite , neutron star cooling etc .",
    "this adds new cooling mechanisms to the already known ones for supernovae , i.e. the usual neutrino emission , which the observation of neutrinos from sn1987a seems to have confirmed .",
    "any additional process can therefore afford a maximum luminosity of roughly @xmath9 ergs / sec .",
    "this will then lead to constraints on the parameters that describe the coupling of the gravitinos to matter in the supernovae .",
    "furthermore since for light gravitinos one has @xmath10 , the superlight gravitino coupling is dominated by the coupling of the goldstino to matter , which is inversely proportional to the supersymmetry breaking scale - squared @xmath11 . for values of @xmath12 in the 100 gev to tev range , the goldstino coupling strengths to matter are of the same order as the ordinary weak interactions .",
    "the gravitino emission in astrophysical settings such as the supernovae can therefore be competitive with the neutrino emission process . observed supernova neutrino luminosity by the imb and kamiokande groups @xcite and its understanding in terms of the standard model of the supernova @xcite therefore allows us to set lower limits on @xmath7 and hence on @xmath13 .",
    "the supernova and other astrophysical constraints on the gravitino mass were first studied in two recent papers@xcite .",
    "the first paper considered the class of models where the superlight gravitino is the only superlight particle in the model with its superpartners having masses in the gev range whereas the last two papers considered the smaller subclass of models @xcite where the gravitino is also accompanied by superlight scalar and pseudoscalar particles . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the first class of models .    in ref.@xcite , gravitino couplings to matter suggested in ref.@xcite",
    "were used .",
    "these couplings have recently been criticized in two papers@xcite and a new set of matter couplings have been proposed for the class of supersymmetry models where the scalar and pseudoscalar partners of the gravitino are heavier ( e.g. in the multi gev range ) than the gravitino .",
    "since the temperature dependence of gravitino emission rates are very different if one uses the new set of feynman rules for gravitino matter couplings , it is necessary to revisit these bounds again .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to use the revised feynman rules for matter gravitino coupling to calculate gravitino emission rates in supernovae , obtain the bounds on the supersymmetry breaking scale , and from them the lower limit on the gravitino mass our result is that the basic processes that dominate the energy loss via gravitino emission are @xmath1 ( called annihilation process below ) and @xmath14 , ( called compton process below ) whereas the process found to dominate in ref.@xcite i.e. @xmath15 is found to make a negligible contribution . the physically interesting lower limit on the @xmath13 remains @xmath16 ev ( where @xmath17 is a model dependent parameter , which can lie anywhere from 50 to 250 gev ) .",
    "this bound is qualitatively somewhat better than the one found in ref.@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we note the various possible processes that can contribute to energy loss from supernovae via @xmath5 emission and , using simple dimensional analysis , obtain the temperature dependence of the emissivity for the different processes and give qualitative arguments to isolate the processes that dominate the emissivity ; we calculate the emissivity ( @xmath18 ) for the compton process in sec .",
    "iii and for the annihilation processes in sec .",
    "iv and derive a lower bound on @xmath7 and @xmath13 from supernova ; in section v we discuss the energy loss from neutron stars .",
    "since gravitinos are superpartners of gravitons , which have universal coupling to matter , we expect them to couple to all matter in pairs . specifically , in the case when the gravitino is superlight , the dominant couplings arise from the coupling of its longitudinal mode@xcite .",
    "goldstinos , like goldstone bosons , must be derivatively coupled . combining this property with the constraints of supersymmetry , luty and ponton@xcite have derived the form of the effective coupling between matter and goldstinos .",
    "the couplings of interest to us are given by@xcite @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where we have denoted the goldstino by @xmath22 and the generic gaugino by @xmath23 for the gauge field @xmath24 . in the @xmath25 coupling the mass parameter",
    "@xmath17 is highly model dependent and sensitive to the details of the supersymmetry breaking sector as well as the nature unification group .",
    "therefore at low energies , this will give additional suppression factors ] .",
    "in ref.@xcite a value of 43 gev is suggested assuming the typical slepton mass to be 200 gev and the squark mass to be 400 gev .",
    "but it is perfectly possible even in the context of gauge mediated models to have very different parameters e.g. slepton masses of 200 gev and squark masses to be a tev@xcite .",
    "we have therefore kept this as a free parameter and express all our results in terms of this number .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the detailed processes that can contribute to the energy loss in in a supernova .",
    "there are the following classes of processes : ( i ) ones that involve both nonrelativistic particles ( e.g. neutrons and protons ) and relativistic particles such as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath22 ; ( ii ) that involve only relativistic particles ; and finally , ( iii ) the ones that involve the decay of the plasmon i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "a typical process of type ( i ) is the analog of the modified urca process for neutrino emission with neutrinos replaced by the gravitinos : @xmath29 . even though the gravitino emission graph involves the exchange of a virtual photon , the derivative couplings present in the gravitino vertex imply that the photon - gravitino - gravitino coupling in momentum space goes like @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the gravitino momenta . for superlight gravitinos ,",
    "the effective virtual photon induced @xmath1 amplitude is like a pointlike four fermi coupling with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "one can therefore use this feature to calculate the gravitino pair emissivity from the known the urca processes@xcite .",
    "one can conclude that the emissivity @xmath18 , defined as the amount of energy emitted from the supernova per unit volume per unit time ( @xmath35 in natural units ) is given by @xmath36    let us now consider several examples of the class ( ii ) processes .",
    "they are ( a ) @xmath1 ; ( b ) @xmath37 ; ( c ) @xmath38 .",
    "let us first focus on the process ( c ) which is the weakest of the three .",
    "since this process involves exchange of a photino , its coupling strength is given by @xmath39 .",
    "therefore from simple dimensional arguments we conclude that the emissivity for this process will go like @xmath40 .",
    "let us now apply similar dimensional arguments to the process ( b ) . in this case the feynman diagrams that contribute",
    "are given in fig .",
    "note that all exchange particles are also light .",
    "therefore the only dimensional parameters are provided by the photon - gravitino coupling strength @xmath41 .",
    "using dimensional analysis , one gets the following temperature dependence for @xmath18 : @xmath42 . here",
    ", we have ignored the effects of pauli exclusion principle in this estimate ; this will be addressed below . but assuming that this effect does not lead to a drastic change in temperature dependence , we see that it clearly dominates over the process ( c ) since supernova core temperatures are of order 30 to 60 mev .",
    "process ( a ) is more subtle since the electrons are degenerate in the supernova core . as a result of this",
    "the positron density is suppressed compared to that of the electron by by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the chemical potential for the electrons .",
    "therefore even though the naive dimensional arguments imply that for this process , the emissivity goes like @xmath45 and is therefore more dominant than the process ( b ) , we will see that in actual practice they are comparable .    the plasmon decay has been considered in @xcite and is found to be negligible .",
    "we therefore do not discuss it here .",
    "the generic formula for the emissivity @xmath18 for a process with initial particles and momenta denoted by @xmath46 and @xmath47 and final state particles and momenta denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 is : @xmath50 in the equation above , @xmath51 denotes the matrix element for the process responsible for gravitino emission ; @xmath52 are the energies of the gravitinos ; @xmath53 are the thermal distributions for the various particles involved in the process . for example the thermal distribution of the electrons and positrons are given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the chemical potential for the electrons .",
    "similarly for the photons we have @xmath56 . for the gravitinos",
    ", we choose the @xmath57 s to be zero since they do not get a chance to thermalize in the supernova .",
    "let us apply this formula to the compton process which is given by the two feynman diagrams in fig.1 .",
    "let us denote the initial and final momenta as follows : @xmath58    in evaluating @xmath59 for this process , we note that the @xmath60 vertex is common to both the direct and the cross diagrams . therefore , we evaluate that absolute square first as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 using its gauge invariance , one can write this as latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 this integral was evaluated by monte carlo method to obtain the emissivity as a function of the supernova core temperature and the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath7 . multiplying by the volume of the supernova ( with radius 10 kilometers ) , we obtained the luminosity which was then set less than @xmath9 ergs / sec .",
    "the bound on the parameter @xmath7 for @xmath71 gev are given table i.    we also wish to point out that we have checked plasma screening effects on our result by redoing the calculation with the propagator @xmath72 replaced by @xmath73 ( with @xmath74 as given in braaten and segel @xcite in the relativistic limit ) .",
    "we find that these effects are well below 5% level as might be expected from the @xmath75 factor in eq .",
    "using similar methods as in section iii , we have calculated the emissivity in this case and find @xmath76 where @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "our expression agrees with that calculated in the ref.@xcite .",
    "we have adopted their notation in eq .",
    "we have evaluated the integrals in the above expression numerically and have obtained lower bounds on the @xmath7 using the requirement that the luminosity in gravitinos have an upper bound of @xmath9 ergs / sec .",
    "the results for this case are comparable to the limits derived from the compton cooling case and both cases are collected in table i. we have varied the core temperature from 30 to 60 mev and used two typical values for the electron chemical potential of 200 and 300 mev . again , since the dependence of the luminosity on the supersymmetry breaking scale goes like the eighth power of temperature , for each case the bigger of the two numbers is the actual bound .",
    "we see that the best bound obtains for the case when the core temperature is assumed to be 60 mev as expected and the chemical potential is 200 mev and is @xmath79    for the case where @xmath80 mev and @xmath81 mev , the bound is @xmath82 gev for both the compton and the annihilation cases .",
    "combining these two together we get the bound to be @xmath83 gev for this choice of supernova parameters . our bound is actually slightly weaker than the bound given in @xcite using only the @xmath84 annihilation mechanism . note that we have a higher value for @xmath17 .",
    "finally , as was first pointed out in @xcite , the above considerations assume that the supernova is transparent to the gravitinos once they are emitted . to check this",
    ", we have to make sure that the mean free path of the grvitino , once emitted is longer than the radius of the supernova ( i.e. 10 km ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the mean free path was calculated using photon - gravitino scattering .",
    "now of course due to the revised feynman rules , the whole picture is different .",
    "the main contribution to opacity comes from gravitino scattering off protons and electrons .",
    "the mean free path for @xmath85 gev due to proton scattering has been calculated in @xcite and we do not repeat their calculation .",
    "they find that for @xmath86 gev , the gravitinos get trapped .",
    "using the techniques employed in @xcite , they have shown that the emissivity remains too large until @xmath87 gev , so that the excluded range of @xmath7 is between 70 gev and 300- 500 gev depending on the choice of core temperature and the electron chemical potential .",
    "this can be translated to a forbidden range for the gravitino mass of @xmath88 ev .",
    "this bound is very similar to the bound obtained in @xcite .",
    "neutron star cooling is an attractive area in which to test non - standard particle physics models , in principle , because the standard model of neutron cooling , based on the `` modified urca process , '' gives insufficient cooling to match current observations .",
    "for a recent review and refernces to the literature see @xcite .",
    "briefly , for neutron stars of ages between about @xmath89 and @xmath90 years , the standard model ( slow cooling ) is one of neutrino emission from an isothermal superfluid core with an energy gap in the 100 kev range .",
    "however data from two pulsars of ages around @xmath91 years show temperatures a factor of 5 or so below the standard model prediction .",
    "time is measured by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the pulsar period while temperature is measured from the ( x - ray ) black body spectrum ( keeping in mind that the surface temperature is believed to be roughly the square root of the interior temperature ( in ev ) ) . for earlier times",
    "only a few upper bounds are available so that there is no good evidence on the temperature dependence of the mechanism that is providing the extra ( fast ) cooling .",
    "however , considerable extra cooling is required since the urca cooling rate is proportional to the eighth power of the temperature .",
    "various mechanisms to provide the extra cooling have been proposed .",
    "these include a smaller superfluid energy gap , meson condensates , and nucleon dissociation into quarks under the high central pressure .",
    "were gravitino emission the source of the extra cooling , that fact would provide a measurment of gravitino coupling rather than a bound .",
    "thus we turn to the question of whether that possibility can be entertained .",
    "as noted earlier , the effective coupling of the gravitino pair to electrons and quarks is via the photon exchange ",
    "however for superlight gravitinos , it reduces effectively to a four fermi interaction like the weak fermi coupling except that the coupling only occurs with electrically charged particles .",
    "one channel for neutron star cooling that involves gravitino emission is therefore via a neutral current like coupling with the coupling constant given by @xmath94 .",
    "thus the relevant process is the analog of the neutral current urca process @xmath95 .",
    "the temperature dependence of this process will be @xmath96 as in the urca process .",
    "so it can compete with the neutrino cooling of neutron stars in the appropriate range for the coupling parameters . assuming that neutrino luminosity describes the cooling of neutron stars long after their birth@xcite",
    ", we assume that luminosity via gravitinos is of same order of magnitude .",
    "( we choose this arbitrarily in view of the scant data on neutron stars at the moment . )    as is well known , in the case of the neutron stars the neutral current driven urca process is about a factor of 30 lower@xcite than the corresponding charged current process , of which a factor of four comes from the coupling and the rest from phase space . since",
    "our couplings are given , we demand that gravitino cooling be less than the full neutrino urca process luminosity .",
    "this leads us to the bound that @xmath97 this implies that @xmath98 gev , which is comparable to the bounds obtained from the supernova .",
    "considerably larger coupling , contrary to the supernova bounds derived above , would be required for gravitino emission to provide an explanation for the fast neutron star cooling observed .",
    "in conclusion , we have revisited the issue of supernova and neutron star constraints on the supersymmetry breaking scale and the ensuing constraint on the mass of the superlight gravitino using the revised feynman rules for the goldstino coupling to matter in a large class of supersymmetric models with a low susy breaking scale .",
    "we find that the lower limits on the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath7 are in the range of 200 to 500 gev and the resulting lower limit on the gravitino mass is @xmath99 ev .",
    "one must however remember that while the form of the gravitino coupling to matter is universal , there is a model dependent parameter @xmath17 that characterises the strength of the coupling . in any case",
    ", these bounds are comparable to the collider bounds obtained by various authors@xcite .",
    "as has been noted earlier@xcite , the corresponding constraints on the gravitino mass are much more severe in models where the gravitino is also accompanied by superlight scalar / or pseudoscalar particles .",
