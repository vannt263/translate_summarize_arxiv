    "with the development of network technologies , numerous novel anticipations , as well as various new technical issues , rise in system analysis and synthesis , due to the significant differences in information exchange methods between a traditional system and a network system . among them , one important issue is state estimation with random measurement droppings , in which plant output measurements are stochastically lost due to failures of information delivery from the plant output measurement sensors to its state estimator @xcite .    over the last decade",
    ", this problem has attracted extensive attentions and various results have been obtained . in @xcite ,",
    "optimality of the traditional kalman filter is established under the existence of random measurement droppings , provided that information is available in the received data on whether or not it is a measured plant output .",
    "it has also been made clear that for an unstable plant , to guarantee boundedness of the expectation of the covariance matrix of estimation errors , in addition to controllability and observability , the probability that the estimator receives plant output measurements must be higher than some threshold values .",
    "afterwards , it is observed that although simultaneous loss of plant output measurements at all sample instants usually has an essential zero probability to occur , it is the dominating fact that leads to an infinite expectation of this covariance matrix .",
    "this observation results in the importance recognition about the probability distribution of this covariance matrix which is argued to be a more appropriate measure on the performances of a state estimator with random data missing @xcite .",
    "particularly , some upper and lower bounds are derived respectively in @xcite for the probability that this covariance matrix is smaller than a prescribed positive definite matrix ( pdm ) . under the condition that an unstable plant has a diagonalizable state transition matrix",
    ", @xcite shows that if some controllability and observability conditions are satisfied , the trace of this covariance matrix decays according to a power law .",
    "based on the contractive properties of riccati recursions and convergence conditions on random iterated functions , this covariance matrix is proved in @xcite to converge in general to a stationary distribution that is independent of its initial values , no matter the measurement loss process is described by a bernoulli process , a markov chain or a semi - markov chain . when the observation arrival is modeled by a bernoulli process and",
    "the packet arrival probability is approximately equal to 1 , this covariance matrix is shown in @xcite to converge weakly to a unique invariant distribution satisfying a moderate deviation principle with a good rate function .    when a plant model is not accurate , which is the general situation in actual engineering applications of a state estimator , recursive state estimations that are robust against modelling errors have also been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "some of these methods have already been extended to systems with an imperfect communication channel , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "especially , in @xcite , a robust state estimator is derived using penalizations on the sensitivity of the innovation process of an estimator to parametric modelling errors , which has a similar form as that of the kalman filter and can be recursively realized without any condition validations and on line design parameter adjustments . moreover , some necessary and sufficient conditions have also been established on the convergence of the pseudo - covariance matrix ( pcm ) of this robust state estimator to a stationary distribution , which include the results on kalman filtering with intermittent observations as special cases .",
    "these investigations have made many important theoretical issues clear about state estimations with random measurement arrivals , and the obtained results appear greatly helpful in the analysis and synthesis of networked systems .",
    "some important issues of this state estimation problem , however , still need further efforts . among them",
    ", one essential problem is about a more accurate characterization of the stationary distribution of the covariance matrix in the kalman filtering or the pcm in the robust estimations , as this characterization is directly connected with their estimation performances and is important in determining requirements on the communication channel @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses properties of the stationary distribution of the pcm in the sensitivity penalization based robust state estimations with random measurement droppings .",
    "the data missing process is assumed to be described by a markov chain , which can include the bernoulli process as a special case . on the basis of a riemannian metric on the space of positive definite matrices ( pdm ) and a central limit theorem for markov chains ,",
    "it is proved that when the modified plant in the robust estimations is both controllable and observable , this pcm converges to a stationary distribution , provided that the data arrival probability is greater than zero .",
    "a convergence rate is also given .",
    "it has also been shown that when the pcm is started from the stablilizing solution to the algebraic riccati equation defined by a modified plant , the pcm process is both stationary and ergodic . from these results ,",
    "two approximations are given for the stationary distribution of the pcm with an arbitrary markov chain probability transition matrix , as well as its convergence rate to the actual value .",
    "these results are also valid for the covariance matrix of the kalman filter with intermittent observations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . at first , in section ii , the sensitivity penalization based robust state estimation procedure with intermittent observations is briefly summarized , and some preliminary results on markov process and riccati recursions are provided .",
    "afterwards , stationarity and ergodicity properties of the pcm process are investigated in section iii , while section iv derives an approximation of the stationary distribution of the pcm , as well as its convergence rate to the actual value .",
    "a numerical example is provided in section v to illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the suggested approximation method .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section vi .",
    "an appendix is included to give proofs of some technical results .    the following notation and symbols are adopted .",
