    "almost all biological activities involve transport in ionic solutions , which involves various couplings and interactions of multiple species of ions . many complicated types of electrolytes involved in biological processes , such as those in ion channel proteins , certain amino acids ( movable side chain ) are crucial to the functions of these ion channels .",
    "the electrostatic properties involving multispecies ( at least three species ) ions can be fundamentally different to those with only one or two species  @xcite .",
    "to see such difference , we study charge conserving poisson - boltzmann ( ccpb ) equation for multispecies ions which is derived from steady state poisson - nernst - planck systems with charge conservation law , and is the surface potential model for the generation of a surface charge density layer related to electric double layers  @xcite . for simplicity of analysis , we consider a physical domain @xmath1 with the simplest geometry , and represent ccpb equation as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total concentration of species @xmath4 with the valence @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the ( electrical ) potential , @xmath7 is the elementary charge , @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath9 is the absolute temperature .",
    "the parameter  @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dielectric constant of the electrolyte , @xmath12 is the thermal voltage , @xmath13 is the length of the domain @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the appropriate concentration scale ( cf .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 is known as the debye length and @xmath0 is of order @xmath17 for the physiological cases of interest ( cf .",
    "thus we may assume @xmath0 as a small parameter tending to zero .",
    "similar equations to ( [ p4 ] ) can also be obtained by the other variational method  @xcite .    under suitable scales on @xmath18 and @xmath0",
    ", we let @xmath19 s be the valences of anions , i.e. , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 s be the valences of cations , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . then the total concentrations of anions and cations are approximately given as @xmath25 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath24 ) , respectively .",
    "hence equation  ( [ p4 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath27   & & \\label{2-eqn1}\\\\[-0.5em ]   & & \\quad\\hbox{for}\\quad x \\in ( -1,1 ) \\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 s and @xmath29 s satisfy @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "most of the physical and biological systems possess the charge neutrality ( zero net charge ) .",
    "one may assume the pointwise charge neutrality i.e.  at all points the anion and cation charges exactly cancel in order to make calculations easier in a free diffusion system ( cf .",
    "@xcite p.  319 ) .",
    "here we replace the pointwise charge neutrality by a weaker hypothesis called the global electroneutrality being represented as @xmath32 which means that the total charges of anions and cations are equal , where @xmath33 s and @xmath29 s are the valences , and @xmath34 s and @xmath35 s are the concentrations of anions and cations , respectively",
    ". consequently , the ccpb equation ( [ 2-eqn1 ] ) may satisfy ( [ g - neutral ] ) .",
    "when one deals with more general ( realistic ) situations , such as when there are more than two species involved in the solution , situations become more subtle and complicated .",
    "note that the equation  ( [ 2-eqn1 ] ) has nonlocal dependence on @xmath18 which is essentially different from the classical poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation as follows : @xmath36 here @xmath37 s and @xmath38 s are bulk concentration of anions and cations , respectively . in equation ( [ 2-eqn1 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath34 s and @xmath35 s are for total concentration of anions and cations , respectively . for notation convenience ,",
    "we use the same notations @xmath34 s and @xmath35 s in equations ( [ 2-eqn1 ] ) and ( [ 2-eqnw ] ) , but with different physical meaning . in this paper",
    ", we shall show different asymptotic behaviors of the ccpb equation  ( [ 2-eqn1 ] ) and the pb equation  ( [ 2-eqnw ] ) for various constants @xmath39 satisfying ( [ g - neutral ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to compare the ccpb equation  ( [ 2-eqn1 ] ) and the pb equation  ( [ 2-eqnw ] ) under the hypothesis ( [ g - neutral ] ) .",
    "such a difference can be clarified in theorems  [ 2-thm : w ] and [ 2-thm5 ] , see also , remark  [ pbn - pb ] .",
    "boundary effects are important in a wide range of applications and provide formidable challenges @xcite . for ccpb equations , the main issue is how boundary conditions effect the solution values ( electric potentials ) at interior and boundary points .",
    "one may use the neumann boundary condition for a given surface charge distribution and the dirichlet boundary condition for a given surface potential ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we consider a robin boundary condition  @xcite for the electrostatic potential @xmath6 at @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 are extrachannel electrostatic potentials and @xmath44 is the coefficient depending on the dielectric constant @xcite , and related to the surface capacitance .",
    "the parameter ratio @xmath45 can be viewed as a measure of the stern layer thickness , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the effective permittivity and the capacitance of the stern layer , respectively ( cf .",
    "thus we may regard @xmath48 as the ratio of the stern - layer width to the debye screening length .",
