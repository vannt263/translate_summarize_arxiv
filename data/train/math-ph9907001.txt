    "physical models and theories are mere approximations to nature and the physical constants can never be known with absolute precision .",
    "therefore , if a fine tuning of the parameters is needed to reproduce some particular phenomenon , it is probable that the model is basically unsound and that its other predictions are unreliable",
    ". a wider range of validity is expected for theories that do not change in a qualitative manner for a small change of parameters .",
    "such theories are called _ stable _ or _",
    "rigid_.    a mathematical structure is said to be _ stable _ ( or _ rigid _ ) for a class of _ deformations _ if any deformation in this class leads to an equivalent ( isomorphic ) structure .",
    "the idea of stability of structures provides a guiding principle to test either the validity or the need for generalization of a physical theory .",
    "namely , if the mathematical structure of a given theory turns out to be unstable , one might just as well deform it , until one falls into a stable one , which has a good chance of being a generalization of wider validity .",
    "the stable - model point of view had a large impact in the field of non - linear dynamics , where it led to the notion of _ structural stability_@xcite@xcite .",
    "as emphasized by flato@xcite and faddeev@xcite the same pattern seems to occur in the fundamental theories of nature .",
    "in fact , the two most important physical revolutions of this century , namely the passage from non - relativistic to relativistic and from classical to quantum mechanics , may be interpreted as the transition from two unstable theories to two stable ones . in the non - relativistic mechanics case ,",
    "one notices that the second cohomology group of the homogeneous galileo group does not vanish and the corresponding algebra has a deformation that leads to the lorentz algebra which , being semisimple , is stable . in turn , the transition from classical to quantum mechanics may be regarded as a deformation of the unstable poisson algebra of phase - space functions to the stable moyal - vey algebra@xcite .",
    "i will refer to these two stabilizing deformations as the @xmath0-deformation and the @xmath1-deformation .",
    "the deformed algebras are all equivalent for non - zero values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "hence , relativistic mechanics and quantum mechanics may be derived from the conditions for stability of their algebras , but the exact values of the deformation parameters can not be fixed by purely algebraic considerations . instead , the deformation parameters are fundamental constants to be obtained from experiment . in this sense not only is deformation theory the theory of stable theories , it is also the theory that identifies the fundamental constants .    a review of deformation theory and of the transition from non - relativistic to relativistic and from classical to quantum mechanics as the deformation - stabilization of two unstable theories is contained in ref.@xcite .",
    "also , it is shown there that both deformations may be studied in the context of finite - dimensional lie algebras , which is simpler than the usual treatment of quantum mechanics as a deformation of an infinite - dimensional algebra of functions .",
    "the algebra that results from the @xmath0-deformation is the lorentz algebra and the one coming from the @xmath2-deformation is the heisenberg algebra .",
    "a simple fact in this construction , which however has non - trivial consequences , is that , to have both constructions in a finite - dimensional algebra setting , it is essential to include the coordinates as basic operators in the defining ( kinematical ) algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the full algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics will then contain the lorentz algebra @xmath3 , the heisenberg algebra for the momenta and space - time coordinates @xmath4 in minkowski space and also the commutators that define the vector nature ( under the lorentz group ) of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , namely @xmath7 & = & i(m_{\\mu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\nu \\rho } + m_{\\nu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\mu \\sigma } -m_{\\nu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\mu \\rho } -m_{\\mu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\nu \\sigma } ) \\\\   \\lbrack m_{\\mu \\nu } , p_{\\lambda } ] & = & i(p_{\\mu } \\eta _ { \\nu \\lambda } -p_{\\nu } \\eta _ { \\mu \\lambda } ) \\\\   \\lbrack m_{\\mu \\nu } , x_{\\lambda } ] & = & i(x_{\\mu } \\eta _ { \\nu \\lambda } -x_{\\nu } \\eta _ { \\mu \\lambda } ) \\\\   \\lbrack p_{\\mu } , p_{\\nu } ] & = & 0 \\\\   \\lbrack x_{\\mu } , x_{\\nu } ] & = & 0 \\\\   \\lbrack p_{\\mu } , x_{\\nu } ] & = & i\\eta _ { \\mu \\nu } \\im   \\end{array } \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 a unit that commutes with all the other operators .",
    "one knows that the lorentz algebra , being semi - simple , is stable and that each one of the 2-dimensional heisenberg algebras @xmath11 is also stable in the non - linear sense discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "when the two algebras are combined through the covariance commutators , the natural question to ask is whether the whole algebra is stable or whether there are any non - trivial deformations .",
    "the answer@xcite is that the algebra @xmath12 defined by eqs.([1.1 ] ) is not stable .",
    "this is shown by exhibiting a 2-parameter @xmath13-deformation of @xmath14 to a simple algebra @xmath15 which itself is stable , namely @xmath16 & = & i(m_{\\mu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\nu \\rho } + m_{\\nu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\mu \\sigma } -m_{\\nu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\mu \\rho } -m_{\\mu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\nu \\sigma } ) \\\\",

    "it is well known that already this subalgebra is not stable and may be deformed@xcite @xcite to the stable simple algebras of the de sitter groups o(4,1 ) or o(3,2 ) .",
    "this is the deformation that corresponds to the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this instability of the poincar algebra is however physically harmless and well understood .",
    "it simply means that flat space is an isolated point in the set of arbitrarily curved spaces .",
    "faddeev@xcite points out that einstein s theory of gravity may be interpreted as a deformation .",
    "this theory is based on curved pseudo riemannian manifolds .",
    "therefore , in the set of riemannian manifolds , minkowski space is an isolated point , whereas a generic riemannian manifold is stable in the sense that in its neighborhood all spaces are curved . however",
    ", as long as the poincar group is used as the kinematical group of the tangent space to the space - time manifold , and not as a group of motions in the manifold itself , it is perfectly consistent to take @xmath25 and this deformation goes away .    for the other deformation parameter ( @xmath26 ) there is no reason to imagine that it should vanish , even in tangent space , if one insists on the stability paradigm as the guiding principle for theory construction .",
    "one is therefore led to @xmath27 as our candidate for a _ stable algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics _ in the tangent space .",
    "the main features are the non - commutativity of the @xmath28 coordinates and the fact that @xmath10 , previously a trivial center of the heisenberg algebra , becomes now a non - trivial operator .",
    "two constants define this deformation .",
    "one is @xmath26 , a fundamental length , the other the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "the tangent space algebra @xmath27 would be the kinematical algebra appropriate for microphysics . for physics in the large",
    ", one might however use @xmath15 with ( finite ) @xmath29 related to the gravitational constant @xmath30 .",
    "the idea of modifying the algebra of the space - time components @xmath28 in such a way that they become non - commuting operators had already appeared several times in the physical literature .",
    "however , rather than being motivated ( and forced ) by stability considerations , the aim of those proposals was to endow space - time with a discrete structure , to be able , for example , to construct quantum fields free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "sometimes a non - zero commutator was simply postulated , some other times the motivation was the formulation of field theory in curved spaces .",
    "although the algebra discussed above is so simple and appears in such a natural way in the context of deformation theory , it seems that , strangely , it differs in some way or another from the past proposals . in some schemes , for example ,",
    "the coordinates were assumed to be the generators of rotations in a 5-dimensional space with constant negative curvature .",
    "this possibility was proposed long ago by snyder@xcite and the consequences of formulating field theories in such spaces were extensively studied by kadishevsky and collaborators@xcite @xcite .",
    "the coordinate commutation relations @xmath31 $ ] are identical to those in ( [ 1.2 ] ) , however , because of the representation chosen for the momentum operators , the heisenberg algebra is different and , in particular , @xmath32 $ ] has non - diagonal terms .",
    "banai@xcite also proposed a specific non - zero commutator which only operates between time and space coordinates , breaking lorentz invariance .",
    "many other discussions exist concerning the emergence and the role of discrete or quantum space - time , which however , in general , do not specify a complete operator algebra@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .    in @xmath27 ,",
    "the fact that @xmath10 becomes a non - trivial operator changes the structure of the heisenberg algebra .",
    "this has some consequences on the construction of the state spaces even for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this was partly discussed in ref.@xcite . here",
    "the emphasis will be on the study of the geometric structure of space - time that follows from the @xmath27 algebra and on the nature of quantum fields .",
    "in particular the larger set of derivations that @xmath27 possesses has for gauge fields some important consequences that do not depend on the size of the parameter @xmath26 , but only on the fact that it is different from zero .",
    "in sect.2 one collects the basic facts about the non - commutative geometry of space - time which are implied by the algebra @xmath27 . in particular ,",
    "the role of the elementary sets of the geometry is clarified and a differential calculus developed . in a general non - commutative geometry setting @xcite , differential calculus can not be developed through derivations , because for some algebras there is not enough derivations .",
    "then , the non - commutative analog of the dirac operator is used for this purpose . in the @xmath27 case",
    ", however , an approach through derivations is possible .",
    "this has the advantage of making the commutative limit ( @xmath33 ) very transparent .",
    "nevertheless , correspondence with the related dirac operator approach is also established .",
    "the representation theory of algebras is the basic tool to extract physical consequences from the non - commutative geometry .",
    "this is discussed at length in sect.3 . in the @xmath27 algebra ,",
    "the usual heisenberg algebras are replaced by the algebras of iso(2 ) and iso(1,1 ) .",
    "a construction of a quantum stochastic calculus based on these algebras is sketched in the appendix .",
    "integration in non - commutative space - time is discussed in sect.4 and finally sect.5 is dedicated to the construction of local quantum fields , the main emphasis being on the non - commutative geometry implications for gauge field interactions .",
    "every geometrical property of an ordinary ( commutative ) manifold @xmath34 may be expressed as a property of the commutative @xmath35-algebra @xmath36 of continuous functions on @xmath34 vanishing at infinity .",
    "for example , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the characters of @xmath36 and the points of the manifold @xmath34 , regular borel measures on @xmath34 correspond to positive linear functionals on @xmath36 , complex vector bundles over @xmath34 are given by the finite projective modules over @xmath36 , etc .",
    "similarly in non - commutative geometry one starts from a non - commutative @xmath35 -algebra and uses the same correspondence as in the commutative case to characterize the geometric properties of the non - commutative space@xcite@xcite .    in a general representation ,",
    "the operators in @xmath27 are not bounded operators . however , once a representation of @xmath27 is obtained , there are standard ways to construct bounded operators from unbounded ones , in the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath27 . for example , @xmath37 or @xmath38 and one constructs from the latter , by norm - completion , the associated @xmath39-algebra .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , the discussion of the representations may be carried out at the @xmath27 algebra level , even if the non - commutative space - time algebra is actually a @xmath35-algebra @xmath40 obtained by the restriction to the bounded operators in the universal enveloping algebra @xmath41 of @xmath27 and norm completion .      in the commutative case , the elementary sets of the space - time manifold @xmath34 ( the points with coordinates @xmath28 ) are in a one - to - one correspondence with the character representations of the algebra . in non - commutative case",
    "the elementary sets are the irreducible unitary representations of the algebra .    in @xmath27 ,",
    "the set @xmath42 is the minimal algebraically closed set that contains the space - time coordinate operators .",
    "it is therefore their representations that define the basic structure of non - commutative space - time .",
    "therefore it is appropriate to compare the nature of the representations of the @xmath43 algebra for the commutative and the noncommutative cases . in the commutative case",
    "@xmath43 is a poincar algebra and in the noncommutative case it is a desitter algebra ( of o(3,2 ) for @xmath44 and of o(4,1 ) for @xmath45 ) . in the following , for definiteness",
    ", i will use @xmath45 . in the commutative case",
    "the elementary sets @xmath46 of the geometry are the spinless representations of the poincar group corresponding to fixed @xmath47@xmath48 from the physical point of view it makes sense to consider these ( and not the points @xmath28 ) as the elementary sets of the geometry because each particular point @xmath28 in @xmath46 is just a particular aspect of the same event seen in different frames . in the noncommutative case",
    "the elementary sets are the representations of the desitter group which reduce to these poincar group representations in the @xmath33 limit .",
    "the correspondence is made very clear by using the explicit representation of the operators of the @xmath27 algebra as differential operators in a 5-dimensional commutative manifold @xmath49 with metric @xmath50@xmath51 in @xmath52 consider the family of hypersurfaces @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "for each fixed @xmath55 , @xmath56 carries a representation of the desitter group ( for @xmath45 ) .",
    "the intersection of each @xmath56 with any plane @xmath57 is a 3-dimensional hypersurface @xmath58 that corresponds to a spinless irreducible unitary representation of the poincar group .",
    "however , because of the @xmath59rotations in the @xmath28 operator ( eq.([2.3 ] ) ) , it is @xmath60 that is irreducible for the @xmath43 algebra .",
    "therefore the elementary sets of the commutative space - time geometry correspond to the @xmath61 sets and those of noncommutative space - time to the @xmath56 @xmath62s .",
    "it should however be clear the @xmath46 and @xmath56 sets are simply abstract representations of the irreducible representations of the algebra and their dimensionality should not be confused with the dimensionality of space - time .",
    "the manifold @xmath52 is simply the carrier of the representation of the non - commutative space - time algebra .",
    "space - time is still defined by the same four @xmath28 operators operating on the elementary geometric sets .",
    "fig.1 depicts the structure of the elementary sets with the @xmath56 @xmath63s , when intersected by the @xmath64 plane , generating the elementary sets of the pseudo - euclidean ( commutative ) minkowski geometry ( and the intersection with the @xmath65 plane generating an euclidean geometry ) .    although not changing the dimensionality of space - time , the @xmath56 sets , as compared to the @xmath46 s , have a richer group of motions and , in particular , a richer set of derivations , as will be seen below .",
    "a differential algebra may be defined either by duality from the derivations of the algebra when a sufficient number of derivations is available or directly from the triple @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a representation of the @xmath40 algebra in the hilbert space @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the dirac operator . in this latter case",
    "the commutator with the dirac operator is used to obtain the one - forms . in the most general non - commutative framework@xcite",
    "it is not always possible to use the derivations of the algebra to construct by duality the differential forms .",
    "in fact many algebras have no derivations at all .",
    "however when the algebra has enough derivations it is useful to consider them@xcite@xcite because the correspondence of the non - commutative geometry notions to the classical ones becomes very clear . in our case",
    "it means to obtain the usual commutative geometry notions in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "for this reason the construction through derivations will be used here and the correspondence to the dirac commutator approach will be established later on .    although not essential , the representation of the remaining operators of the @xmath27 algebra as differential operators on @xmath52 provides an intuitive interpretation of the derivations and is listed below @xmath70    the derivations of the algebra play , as in the classical case , the role of vector fields .",
    "the derivations that are considered , to construct by duality the differential algebra , play only a subsidiary role in identifying the minimal extension needed when going from the commutative ( @xmath71 ) to the non - commutative case ( @xmath72 ) . in the end",
    "it is the resulting differential algebra which plays the central role .",
    "the minimal algebraically closed subalgebra that contains the coordinate operators , @xmath73 , being semisimple , it only has inner derivations . in particular because of the commutation relation @xmath74=i\\eta _ { \\mu \\nu } \\im $ ] and the non - triviality of the @xmath10 operator , the derivations that correspond to the momentum operator are not contained in the set of derivations of the enveloping algebra of @xmath43 ( der@xmath75 ) . therefore , to obtain enough derivations , one should consider the full algebra @xmath27 and its generalized enveloping algebra @xmath41 , to which a unit and , for later convenience , the inverse of @xmath10 , are also added .",
    "@xmath76 the derivations of @xmath27 are the inner derivations plus a dilation @xmath77 which acts on the generators as follows @xmath78 & = & p_{\\mu } &   &   \\\\   \\lbrack { \\cal d},\\im ] & = & \\im   &   &",

    "the same result could have been obtained by studying the distribution of the random variable with characteristic function @xmath237      in the appendix , a quantum stochastic calculus is developed , based on iso(1,1 ) and iso(2 ) , that are the algebraic structures of the operator sets @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "the stochastic processes constructed there , are sums of independent identically distributed random variables .",
    "therefore , the  time  of the process is simply the continuous parameter that labels the probability convolution semigroup .",

    "the last case corresponds to the principal series of @xmath258 representations .",
    "one sees that the time and the space coordinates are noncommuting operators .",
    "therefore , when describing a process , time can not be simply considered a c - number parameter . instead , to describe , for example , a stochastic process that at each fixed time may be sampled to find out the value of the space variable , what one has to do is to find the subspaces of time eigenvectors , corresponding to each fixed eigenvalue @xmath259 .",
    "then , in each such subspace , one has to find the possible values of @xmath181 and their probabilities .",
    "if no further constraints are imposed on the values of @xmath181 , this will be the analog of brownian motion in the noncommutative one - time one - space setting .",
    "the eigenvectors of the time operator in ( [ 3.28 ] ) are obtained from @xmath260 the solution being @xmath261 with @xmath262 an arbitrary function of @xmath263 .",

    "@xmath275 for the other coefficients , they are more conveniently obtained by solving ( [ 3.29 ] ) in a @xmath164 basis , @xmath276 which leads to the recurrence @xmath277 for @xmath278 , using a recurrence relation for hypergeometric functions one obtains @xmath279 .",
    "then @xmath280 @xmath281 being pollaczek - meixner polynomials with generating function @xmath282    hence , without further restrictions on the dynamics , the process that at @xmath283 starts from @xmath267 , has a probability to be found at @xmath284 at time @xmath285 equal to @xmath286      the full algebra @xmath27 , described in sect.2 , is isomorphic to the algebra of @xmath287 , the group of motions of the pseudo - euclidean @xmath288-space @xmath289 .",
    "consequently , as pointed out in sect.2 , a representation may be obtained in the form of differential operators in a 5-dimensional commutative manifold . alternatively , as for the lower dimension subalgebras treated before , a representation is obtained in the space of functions on the upper sheet of the cone @xmath290 , with coordinates @xmath291 the invariant measure for which the functions are square - integrable being @xmath292    on these functions the operators of @xmath27 act as follows @xmath293    this is the appropriate representation to generalize to higher dimensions the construction of processes carried out in the previous subsections .",
    "here one has to distinguish two cases . because the energy - momentum operators @xmath294 are a commuting set , integration in momentum space is the usual commutative lebesgue integration .",
    "however the domain of integration must be consistent with the structure of the algebra of observables . from the representation ( [ 3.38 ] )",
    "one sees that , when @xmath295 are diagonalized , integration over momentum space corresponds to @xmath296 @xmath297 being the invariant measure defined in ( [ 3.37a ] ) and the @xmath298 in the functional @xmath299 being replaced by their representations in ( [ 3.38 ] ) .",
    "integration over configuration space , however , differs from lebesgue integration because @xmath300 is not a commuting set .    in the commutative case",
    "an integral @xmath301 has the following algebraic interpretation : in a representation where @xmath181 is diagonalized @xmath302 is the diagonal element @xmath303 and the integral ( [ 4.2 ] ) is a weighed trace , with the weights assigned to each eigenvalue by the measure @xmath304 . for compact operators",
    "a non - commutative integration theory has been developed with the integral replaced by the dixmier trace .",
    "infinitesimals of order @xmath305 are compact operators with eigenvalues @xmath306 as @xmath307 . then , given the sequence @xmath308 there is a linear form @xmath309 on the space @xmath310 of bounded sequences which satisfies the properties of linearity and scale invariance needed to interpret it as an algebraic substitute for the notion of integral .",
    "this form is the dixmier trace which , if the sequence ( [ 4.3 ] ) converges , coincides with its limit .",
    "the coordinate operators are not compact operators .",
    "therefore , when constructing the non - commutative version of integration over configuration space , the question of the regularization factor in the trace should be carefully analysed .",
    "consider first integration in one space variable .",
    "as discussed in sect.3 , the spectrum of @xmath181 is @xmath311 .",
    "therefore the trace is a sum over @xmath312@xmath313 the question is whether one needs a @xmath314dependent regularization factor , to interpret this trace as the integral ( like the @xmath315 in the dixmier trace ) .",
    "comparing @xmath316 with @xmath317 the conclusion is that , in this case , the trace itself has the same singularity structure as the corresponding continuous integral .. therefore it seems consistent to simply use the trace , without any regularization factor , as the definition of the integral .",
    "this is carried over to configuration space integration on the 4-dimensional case by defining an orthonormal basis @xmath318 for functions on the cone @xmath290,where @xmath319 , @xmath320 and @xmath321 is an hermite polynomial .",
    "integration is then defined by the trace . @xmath322",
    "being understood that the @xmath323 in ( [ 4.4 ] ) are represented by the operators in ( [ 3.38 ] ) .",
    "in the @xmath27 algebra , @xmath324 is a commuting set .",
    "therefore a complete set of eigenstates of the momentum may be constructed and , in momentum - space , calculations may be carried out as in the commutative case . however quantum fields over space - time are also needed , to construct local interactions . because the momenta and the coordinates are not heisenberg dual , the usual fourier transform can not be used to construct local fields .",
    "this is then replaced by the following construction :    given a representation where the operators @xmath324 act as multiplicative operators in a space of functions ( sect.3 ) , @xmath325 is also a well defined multiplicative operator .",

    ". moreover it is known that for compact @xmath34 there is a one - to - one correspondence between vector bundles and finite projective modules over the space @xmath331 of continuous functions on @xmath34 @xcite@xcite .",

    "as discussed before , if this representation is used , the trace has the same singularity structure as the corresponding commutative integral . for other representations however , a regularizing factor ( as in the dixmier trace )",
    "may have to be used .    to construct an action for the electromagnetic field consider a diagonal metric @xmath373 and construct @xmath374 where @xmath375 .",

    "the existence of additional field components is not associated to extra dimensions or a multi - sheeted nature for space - time .",

    "coupling the fermions to the gauge fields @xmath395 @xmath396 is a set of representatives of the internal symmetry lie algebra . from ( [ 8.38 ] )",
    "one sees that fermions may be coupled to the connection @xmath383 without having to introduce new degrees of freedom in the fermion sector .",
    "the existence of the additional degree of freedom on the connections is a consequence of the non - commutative space - time algebra which does not depend on the magnitude of @xmath26 but just on @xmath26 being @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , in addition to the specific effects coming from the non - commutativity of the @xmath41 algebra , a more dramatic consequence is the emergence of new interactions which , for each gauge model , follow from the gauge principle .    connes and lott@xcite and several other authors after them ( for a review and references see @xcite@xcite ) have used the @xmath397 scheme to construct a geometric formulation of the standard model .",
    "what essentially is done is to consider as geometric space the product of a commutative 4-dimensional space - time with a discrete space .",

    "this construction provides a nice bookkeeping of the higgs phenomena and the kobayashi - maskawa matrix although it is a little hard to believe that a phenomenological model , with so many free parameters as the standard model , is a direct manifestation of the intrinsic geometry of space - time .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom arising from the non - commutative space - time structure that i have been discussing have a quite different origin from those in the connes - lott construction .",
    "they are not associated to any discrete component in space - time but to the structure of the derivations and the differential algebra .",
    "also there is no reason to expect them to be related to the higgs phenomenon .",
    "in fact if the structure that we obtained from the structural stability idea is a good clue to the behavior of nature , we would expect the extra degrees of freedom to manifest themselves at the same level of dimensions as the size of the fundamental length parameter .",
    "they are a consequence of the structure of the differential algebra and they appear both in the abelian and non - abelian theories , through the fields that are connections",
    ". of particular interest from the experimental point of view is the pseudoscalar partner of the photon associated to the @xmath398 component of the abelian connection .",
    "the only non - trivial action of the derivation @xmath88 is on the coordinate operators @xmath28 . from ( [ 2.6 ] ) one sees that in the @xmath399 limit this action vanishes and all the effects of the @xmath400 derivation ( extra connection components , etc . )",
