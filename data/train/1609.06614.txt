    "<S> arguing that correlations are strongly suppressed at time scales when the sound peaks hit the boundaries , a cutoff time @xmath13 is introduced  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this cutoff causes the effective conductivity to depend on @xmath3 and to diverge for @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> anomalous conductivities have been observed to be accompanied by temperature profiles with divergent derivatives at the boundaries  @xcite , namely @xmath15 with @xmath16 and symmetrically for @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> an exact calculation of the temperature profile has been carried out for the harmonic chain with momentum exchange ( hcme ) in fixed boundary conditions ( bcs )  @xcite , but a more general theoretical framework is lacking . in a related phenomenological approach to heat conduction , quanta of heat are assumed to undergo lvy flights  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lvy particle density and current hence become analogous to the temperature and the energy current , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> excellent agreement has been observed in some cases  @xcite , but there is no known generic way to translate a heat conducting system into a lvy equivalent .    in this work we present a general framework which takes into account the effect of bcs for evaluating temperature profiles and in particular the exponent @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply this method to the hcme . </S>",
    "<S> let us start by introducing some general considerations . for small temperature differences </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 , the stationary distribution is close to local equilibrium . linearizing around it , we get  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the stationary heat current , which does not depend on space . the kernel @xmath22 is expected to be determined by the equilibrium properties of the system through @xmath23 at this point , replacing the current - current correlation by its infinite system counterpart generally ( although not always  @xcite ) provides the correct scaling exponent @xmath0 after properly introducing the upper cutoff time @xmath24 in . </S>",
    "<S> there is however no guarantee that this approximation can be made in general . in several studies </S>",
    "<S> the temperature profile  @xcite , the current prefactor @xmath25  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite or even the exponent @xmath0  @xcite were found to depend on the bcs .    in the context of anomalous transport , one can assume a large-@xmath3 scaling form of the temperature profile , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not depend on @xmath3 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> using the scaling forms   in the large @xmath3 limit , becomes @xmath30 with the asymptotic kernel @xmath31 where the fact that the limit   exists fixes the value of the exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> equation   determines both the temperature profile @xmath32 and the current @xmath28 once the boundary values of the temperature are specified . here </S>",
    "<S> we simply assume that there is no discontinuity at the boundaries , which imposes the normalization @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> one can therefore solve   for @xmath32 up to a multiplicative constant , impose the normalization and then compute @xmath28 using   with known @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming that @xmath34 can be replaced by its infinite system expression @xmath35 , as imposed by the scaling   and translational invariance , yields further simplification . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to the noisy dynamics  , momenta of neighboring sites are exchanged with a constant rate @xmath49 to allow the model to relax to a gibbs state under equilibrium conditions . </S>",

    "<S> , the solution   diverges near both boundaries @xmath54 and @xmath55 with an exponent @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> however , replacing @xmath57 by @xmath58 gives the solution   and @xmath59 , in contradiction to . </S>",

    "<S> on hd time scales a random fluctuation decomposes into two balistically moving sound peaks , whose evolution is governed either by kardar - parisi - zhang or edwards - wilkinson equations , and one symmetric heat peak generically shaped like a lvy distribution  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> contrary to the bulk equations , there is no general recipe for deriving the bcs for the hd equations . here </S>",
    "<S> the strategy is to introduce extra stretch and momentum variables in order to extend the structure of the bulk equations to the boundary equations @xmath77 at the cost of introducing additional conditions , that become the hd bcs after coarse - graining . as in the bulk </S>",
    "<S> , we expect the momentum exchange to lead to high order spatial derivatives , making it negligible after coarse - graining , see   and  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the kernel is the same as that of an infinite system and depends only on @xmath112 . the profile is therefore given by   with @xmath51 , yielding an exponent @xmath59 for the boundary singularities . </S>",

    "<S> the linear response relation   should be valid for other systems when the temperature difference is small , @xmath132 and the system size @xmath3 is large . in this regard , the hcme constitutes a landmark in which hd bcs can be obtained , the hd equations  - can be solved exactly and the solution is valid for any @xmath29 . the analysis leading to   shows that a single reflection of the sound peaks can be enough to modify the asymptotic temperature profile </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to apply the same approach to other systems and obtain the temperature profiles for systems such as fermi - pasta - ulam chains or gas models . </S>",
