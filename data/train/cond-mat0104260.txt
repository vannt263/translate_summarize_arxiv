    "two different scaling ranges are found for the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath35 ; one , from five to 60 days ( or twelve weeks ) with a non - brownian @xmath54 and thus @xmath55 type of behavior , and another , after that for up to one year with mostly brownian - like fluctuations within the standard error bars ( see table 2 ) .",

    "this so - called correlation matrix is displayed for the time interval hereby considered , i.e. from jan .",
    "01 , 1995 till dec . 31 , 1998 .",
    "the interval is so chosen because the latter has to be reduced on one hand at the lower end due to the size of the testing window box , and at the upper end by the fact that after jan . 01 , 1999 the 11 currencies are not independent any more since their conversion rates are fixed within the @xmath0 .",
    "as described elsewhere , e.g. in ref .",
    ", such a correlation diagram can be divided into its main sectors through a horizontal , a vertical and diagonal lines crossing at ( 0.5,0.5 ) .",
    "if the correlation is strong the cloud of points should fall along the slope @xmath64 line .",
    "it appears that the strongest correlation is that between @xmath65 and @xmath34 , while @xmath19 , @xmath24 , and @xmath10 show weak correlations with @xmath0 for @xmath1 exr as a reference currency ( fig .",
    "the rest of the referencing currencies , i.e. @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , view @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and also @xmath21 , and @xmath25 as the leading correlated currencies in defining the @xmath0 behavior , while the @xmath22 , @xmath9 and @xmath24 seem to be outside this leading process . @xmath23 and @xmath10 being rather peculiar with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath19 joins the more regular ones in the @xmath5 exr case .",
    "finally , _ no correlation _ between the @xmath0 and the 11 participating currencies exist from the point of view of @xmath2 exr ( fig .",
    "we have thus studied a few aspects of the @xmath0 exchange rates from the point of view of the fluctuations of the @xmath0 and the 11 currencies forming the latter .",
    "we have examined here the exchange rates toward @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in examining various @xmath66 exchange rates for the currencies forming the @xmath0 before jan . 01 , 1999",
    "we have searched at whether correlations would confirm historical and financial view points and so called standard knowledge . the fluctuation distribution density as examined confirms that the foreign exchange markets do not follow gaussian distributions .",
    "the distribution of the fluctuations is close to a gaussian one only for small fluctuations , with power - law distribution@xcite for large fluctuations .",
    "however the correlation between fluctuations were close to the brownian case , and the more so after the @xmath0 was introduced .",
    "there is no doubt that speculators have not yet found the best way to play on the @xmath0 exchange rates , as done if the dfa-@xmath14 exponent is markedly different from 0.5.@xcite it has been noticed that the introduction of the @xmath0 tends to smoothen the fluctuations and their correlations , as well gather together in a main stream most of the european currencies , forming the @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless it has been pointed out in the previous sections that some currencies are more tied to external ones than others due to economic and geographic - like conditions .",
    "several remarks follow from the correlations observed by examining the structural diagrams ( figs.7 ) . while the structural diagrams for @xmath19 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 with respect to @xmath0 show weak or no correlation at all , the structural diagram for @xmath7 shows very strong correlations between the time dependent @xmath14-exponents .",
    "it is clear that the leading currencies _ from the point of view of the exchange rate fluctuations _ were @xmath7 , @xmath8 , together with @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 , while @xmath10 and @xmath24 are far away from the main stream .",
    "it is known that the median is sometimes a better representation of the main behavior of a system , being more sensitive to the contributions from far away events .",
    "therefore we consider the ratio between the @xmath59 and the @xmath60 .",
    "this is done in fig . 8 for the mean and median values of the @xmath14 exponents",
    "fxr with respect to @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the case of @xmath2 is seen in fig .",
    "the fact that the @xmath59/@xmath60 ratio departs from unity indicates that the distribution of @xmath14 for @xmath67 ( @xmath29=fixed ) departs from gaussian , for which @xmath68 .",
    "therefore one may expect that the ratio @xmath59/@xmath60 could also be used in speculation cases , and improve the way gains can be obtained.@xcite    we have observed that the @xmath7 is the strongest currency that has dominated the correlations of the fluctuations in @xmath0 exchange rates with respect to the top world leading currencies , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and even @xmath3 and @xmath1 , while @xmath10 was the most extreme one in the other direction .",
    "can one gain or loose in investing in eur _ per se _ ? .. is still an open question , though the behavior of fluctuations is not in favor of speculators .",
    "is the @xmath0 a gain for humanity or not ? is the @xmath7 really the strong currency ? if one had removed all currencies and established that the @xmath7 was to become the currency in the @xmath7-zone , with the deutsche bundesbank ( buba ) in charge of financial policy , most would have shouted loudly . in the present european policy , all central banks , including the buba lost control of their financial policy ... somewhat .",
    "is that better ?",
    "the answer is found in both cases in the behavior of @xmath14 local , and in a previous observation by ref . that the change in @xmath14 as a function of time is directly linked to the interest rate of the involved currencies .",
    "thus if @xmath14 is too far away from 0.5 it is advisable for central banks to modify the exchange rate in order to avoid gigantic speculation . mr .",
    "a. greenspan just did it , without knowing the @xmath69 behavior theory .",
    "the same can be suggested to mr .",
    "w. duisenberg for the @xmath0 behavior .",
    "as long as @xmath14 is not too far away from 0.5 ( the closest is @xmath40 ) there is no fear to have .",
    "the trend is governed by more general european economy considerations . however if it is noticed that @xmath69 significantly deviates from 0.5 ( the cases of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) a major investigation on the @xmath0 and @xmath2 and @xmath3 rate evolution should be made .",
    "a change in interest rate should be swift if necessary .",
    "notice that to wait a long time , as in the plaza agreement , case is detrimental.@xcite    floating exchange rates ( and high capital mobility ) presently describe the monetary regime in most countries . in the early 1960s",
    "however almost all countries were linked together by fixed exchange rates within the so - called bretton woods system .",
    "international capital movements were highly curtailed , in particular by extensive capital and exchange rate controls . yet in 1961 mundell in his article on _ optimum currency areas_@xcite asked whether it is advantageous to relinquish monetary sovereignty in favor of a common currency ? it was noticed that due to high capital mobility in the world economy , regimes with a temporarily fixed , but adjustable , exchange rate become fragile . a currency union or a floating exchange rate was proposed to be a relevant alternative , as with the common european currency . under a fixed exchange rate , the central bank must intervene on the currency market in order to satisfy the public s demand for foreign currency at this exchange rate . as a result , the central banks loose control of the money supply , which adjusts itself to the domestic liquidity . to implement independent national monetary policy by means of",
    "so - called _ open market operations _ becomes futile because neither the interest rate nor the exchange rate could be affected .",
    "from fig.1 it is observed that already before 1999 the separate currencies in the then european monetary union were indeed fluctuating in rather similar ways .",
    "how this was implemented is nevertheless irrelevant for our purpose : complex monetary and fiscal policy of many ( sorts of ) governments have been surely influencing national economic activity , and correlation between fexcr and other economic data is out of our intent but could be usefully investigated .",
    "yet the speed of adjustment on fexcr markets and some temporarily @xmath70 are well seen in the various figures ; they could be related to the wake of some political @xmath71 disturbances .",
    "whether high labor mobility ( supposed to be the remedy in order to offset such economic policy disturbances ) was effectively intrinsic is hard to believe at this time . yet",
    "( after 1999 ) no supposedly strong currency was sacrificed for the @xmath0 , and the @xmath0 did not save any supposedly weak currency . even though in 1996 several countries were far away from the maastricht criteria,@xcite the @xmath0 seems to have been an interesting vaccine.@xcite    all inventors of moneys surely thought about stability .",
