    "the gravity probe b ( gp - b ) satellite is scheduled to fly in the year 2000 .",
    "it contains a set of gyroscopes intended to test the predictions of general relativity that a gyroscope in a low ( altitude@xmath0 ) circular polar orbit will precess , relative to a distant star , about 6.6 _ arcsec / year _ in the orbital plane ( desitter , or geodetic , precession ) and about 42 _",
    "milliarcsec / year _ perpendicular to the orbital plane ( lense  thirring , or frame  dragging , precession ) . to provide the desired measurement accuracy ( 1 part in @xmath1 for the geodetic effect ) , a magnetic london",
    "moment readout using squid has been chosen , so that the experiment will be carried out at low temperature ( @xmath2 ) , and the gyro rotors will be superconducting ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite for the design and status of the experiment ; the history of gp - b development is found in  @xcite , and a survey of space relativity tests is in  @xcite ) .",
    "the direction of the magnetic london moment developed in a rotating superconductor coincides with the direction of the rotation ( spin ) axis ( f.london  @xcite ; for basic superconductor physics see  @xcite ; the description of gyromagnetic effects can be found in  @xcite , ch .",
    "the corresponding magnetic flux through the pick - up loop of the sqiud is proportional to the sine of the angle between the london moment vector and the pick - up loop plane , so the change of this angle , and thus the drift of the gyroscope axis , can be detected from the squid signal at the roll frequency of the spacecraft which will be deliberately rotated .",
    "however , along with the london moment dipole , there will also be quantum  size sources of magnetic field ( fluxons ) pinned to the surface of the superconducting rotor ( see  @xcite , ch . 5 ;  @xcite , ch .",
    "12 ) which produce additional magnetic flux through the pick - up loop called trapped flux ; its time signature will be present in the squid output .",
    "the low frequency part of this signal , though comparatively small under the gp - b conditions , might corrupt the accuracy of the london moment readout . on the other hand , its high frequency part can provide additional information significant for the experimental results . to make sure the trapped flux does not affect the measurement precision , as well as to extract useful information from it",
    ", one has to analyze the trapped flux signal and develop the code generating it , for the use in simulations of the gp - b error analysis and data reduction .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper .",
    "note that the first work on the analysis of the trapped flux from a gp - b rotor was done by l.wai in his thesis  @xcite .    in sec . ii we give a closed form solution to a magnetostatic problem of a fluxon on the surface of the gyroscope . in sec .",
    "iii the solution is used to find the trapped flux signal in the pick - up loop as a function of the fluxon s position .",
    "the closed form expression for the trapped flux appears to be not very useful for further applications , so various exact and approximate formulas are also obtained . in sec .",
    "iv we investigate the motion of a fluxon with respect to the pick - up loop , thus finding the time signature of the trapped flux signal ; we then go on to analyze its frequency spectrum .",
    "the last section contains a brief description of the program used to simulate trapped flux for the gp - b data processing routines .",
    "pictures of the high frequency signal , its low frequency envelope , and various fourier spectra are presented and discussed .",
    "the gp - b experiment will be conducted at low temperatures , so the fluxons can be treated as static ( welded to the rotor s surface ) and non - interacting ones .",
    "in such a case the total fluxon field is a superposition of the fields of individual fluxons .",
    "in addition , the rate of change of this field due to the rotor s motion is negligible , hence the magnetostatic approach should be used .",
    "thus we consider a single fluxon whose characteristic size is on the order of @xmath3 (  @xcite , p. 184 ) ; due to a macroscopic size of the gyroscope ( 1.91 _ cm _ radius ) , the fluxon can be treated as a point source of magnetic field with the coordinate angles @xmath4 on the surface @xmath5 of the rotor .",
    "the spherical coordinates @xmath6 here correspond to a cartesian frame @xmath7 fastened to the pick  up loop so that the origin coincides with the loop center and the @xmath8 axis is perpendicular to the loop plane ; the real relative motion of the fluxon and the loop , i. e. , the dependence of the fluxon position angles @xmath4 on time , will be incorporated and examined in sec .",
    "iv .    in these settings ,",
    "the boundary value problem for the magnetic potential @xmath9 of the fluxon outside the rotor is formulated as    @xmath10    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the magnetic flux quantum , and the magnetic field is @xmath13 evidently , up to a factor @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the green s function of the external neumann boundary value problem for a sphere .",
    "a standard separation of variables leads to the following series representation of the solution to ( [ eq : laplace ] ) , ( [ eq : bvp - neumann ] ) : @xmath16 with the coefficients given by @xmath17    as it turns out , this series may be summed to give the closed form solution for @xmath15 . to determine it ,",
    "we first introduce ( [ eq : psi - coeffs ] ) into ( [ eq : psi - separation ] ) to obtain @xmath18\\ ] ] then , by applying the addition theorem for legendre functions ( see  @xcite , 10.11 , ( 47 ) ) , we convert the latter into @xmath19 , \\label{eq : psi - singleseries}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the angle between the directions to the fluxon and to the observer : @xmath21    the first of the series in the above expression for @xmath15 is obviously the generating function for legendre polynomials ( see  @xcite , 10.10 , ( 39 ) ) , the second one is just an integral of it , namely , @xmath22 using these results in ( [ eq : psi - singleseries ] ) , we can now write the magnetic potential in its final form as a finite combination of elementary functions : @xmath23 , \\label{eq : psi - closed}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the mentioned green function and @xmath25 is the position vector of the source .",
    "the first term here , as one would expect , is a half of the potential of a point charge , and the addition to it describes the contribution of the curved boundary .    since , surprisingly enough , we were not able to find this explicit formula in literature , it seems reasonable to give here a closed form expression for the green function of the corresponding dirichlet problem ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "in which the boundary condition ( [ eq : bvp - neumann ] ) is replaced by @xmath27 the result then is @xmath28 note that green s functions for the corresponding internal problems can be obtained from  ( [ eq : psi - closed ] ) and  ( [ eq : bvp - dclosed ] ) by means of inversion .",
    "magnetic flux measured by the pick - up loop of a gp - b squid is the flux through the circle of the radius @xmath29 in the plane @xmath30 , or , equivalently , the flux through the ( upper ) hemisphere .",
    "the dependence of the trapped flux on the fluxon position turns out to be rather complicated , especially for the gp - b design , when the gap between the rotor and the loop is very small as compared to the pick - up loop radius @xmath29 . for that reason we give here a number of different representations of the trapped flux as a function of the fluxon position ; each of them has its own merits and drawbacks and is thus used for different purposes pertinent to our investigation .      the simplest way to calculate",
    "the trapped flux is to integrate over the hemisphere the series expression for the radial component of the magnetic field obtained from  ( [ eq : magnfield])([eq : psi - coeffs ] ) : @xmath31 all spherical harmonics with @xmath32 here have averaged out over the azimuthal angle @xmath33 .",
    "the last integral is calculated with the help of the known relations of the theory of legendre polynomials ( see  @xcite , 10.10 , ( 14 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) ) : @xmath34 @xmath35 is the euler gamma - function . then , after inserting the values @xmath36 from  ( [ eq : psi - coeffs ] ) , we arrive at the following expressions : @xmath37 @xmath38 = { 2\\over \\sqrt{\\pi}}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( -1)^{k}\\,{k+3/4\\over ( k+1)!}\\,\\gamma(k+1/2)\\ , \\left(1-\\delta\\right)^{2k+1}p_{2k+1}(s ) \\label{eq : univ_series}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 denotes the dimensionless gap between the pick - up loop and the rotor , @xmath40 .    from the point of view of signal processing , @xmath41 is a transfer function which converts the `` input '' fluxon position signal @xmath42 ( the position is changing with the time as the rotor moves relative to the pick - up loop , see the next section ) , into an `` output '' trapped flux signal @xmath43 which is present in the gp - b readout .",
    "for the reason that the total contribution to the flux of any number of fluxons scattered in any way over the rotor s surface is given by the sum of the values of the same function @xmath44 taken at proper different values of its argument , it was called `` universal curve '' in  @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath41 is an odd function of @xmath45 ; in particular , @xmath46 means that a fluxon sitting exactly in the pick - up loop plane does not , of course , register any flux .    by setting @xmath47 in  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) ( the loop on the surface of the rotor ) , we immediately find @xmath48 ( the last equality here is proved by expanding its right - hand side in orthogonal series of legendre polynomials ) .",
    "this result obtained by l.wai  @xcite has a clear physical meaning : when the pick - up loop lies on the rotor s surface , same as the point source of field always does , the flux through the loop remains unchanged ( @xmath49 , half of the total ) while the fluxon stays in either of the hemispheres separated by the plane of the loop , and changes it sign by a jump when the fluxon crosses this plane .",
    "however , equation  ( [ eq : univ_d0 ] ) also demonstrates the difficulties in using expression  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) for gp - b , where @xmath50 is very small : for any @xmath51 the series  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) has an absolutely converging majorant , so its sum @xmath41 is an analytical function of @xmath45 , but it has a jump discontinuity at @xmath52 when @xmath47 .",
    "therefore the series  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) converges worse and worse with the separation @xmath39 becoming smaller and smaller , which makes  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) practically unacceptable for accurate numerical calculations at the required value of separation .",
    "it also turns finding _ a uniform in @xmath45 _ asymptotic expansion of @xmath41 for @xmath53 into a rather difficult mathematical problem .",
    "the effect is that for small positive values of @xmath39 the transfer function has a shape of a very steep `` kink '' ( recall that @xmath41 is odd ) : it is almost constant outside a small vicinity @xmath54 of the origin , with @xmath55 as shown below , and is equal to zero at @xmath52 with a huge gradient @xmath56 there ( see fig .",
    "that is why we are deriving three more representations for @xmath41 in the following subsections .",
    "an integral expression for @xmath41 is obtained by replacing the legendre polynomials in  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) by their integral representation ( see  @xcite , 10.10 , ( 43 ) ) @xmath57\\,d\\psi}{\\sqrt{2\\left(\\cos\\psi-\\cos\\vartheta_f\\right)}}\\ ] ] changing then the order of summation and integration , we arrive at a sum of two hypergeometric series which are readily summed up to result in : @xmath58 , \\,\\,\\,\\",

    "v ) , because the integrand in  ( [ eq : univ_integr ] ) is an algebraic one , and the weak singularity at the upper limit can be taken care of rather easily . the plot of the transfer function computed from  ( [ eq : univ_integr ] )",
    "is given in fig .  1",
    ", along with the graphs of its various approximations described in the next subsection .",
    "the relative error of the numerical computation has been kept within @xmath59 .      from the described behavior of @xmath41 for small @xmath39",
    "it is clear that to effectively approximate it one needs the value of its gradient at @xmath52 and the `` saturation '' value @xmath60 , in the first place .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to compute these quantities exactly , and they are @xmath61=1-(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\delta+o(\\delta ^2 ) ; \\label{eq : fd}\\ ] ] @xmath62= { 2\\over\\pi}\\ , \\left [ { 1\\over\\delta } + 2+o(\\delta\\log\\delta^{-1 } ) \\right ] , \\quad \\delta\\rightarrow0 ; \\label{eq : kd}\\ ] ] here @xmath63 are complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively ( see  @xcite , ch .",
    "ix for their definitions and asymptotic behavior at @xmath64 ) .",
    "the formulas are derived from  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) by the direct summation of the corresponding series of legendre polynomials carried out in the appendix .",
    "the simplest approximation of the transfer function for @xmath65 is evidently a piecewise - linear one , @xmath66 with @xmath67 defined in a natural way as @xmath68 it turns out that this approximation gives the right qualitative picture of the signal and even is not too bad quantitatively , providing , for all values @xmath69 , the error within @xmath70 for both @xmath71 and @xmath50 .",
    "this accuracy , however , is not enough for the gp - b simulations , moreover , the largest error , associated with the jump of the derivative of function  ( [ eq : univ_lin ] ) at @xmath72 , occurs in a very sensitive transition region where the fast growth of @xmath41 is replaced by its almost constant behavior .",
    "a much more attractive approximation is given by the function @xmath73 the parameters here are arranged in such a way that the slope at @xmath52 is exactly @xmath74 and , in the spirit of asymptotic methods , the true saturation value is achieved when @xmath75 ( note that another `` simple and natural '' approximating function , the hyperbolic tangent , is not acceptable , because the rate of approaching of @xmath76 by @xmath41 is a power rather than exponential one ) .",
    "the performance of the approximation  ( [ eq : univ_atan ] ) exceeds all expectations , giving , over the whole range of @xmath45 , the maximum error of @xmath77 for @xmath71 , and only @xmath78 for @xmath50 .",
    "= 0.6    fig .",
    "1 . universal curve @xmath79 .",
    "the accuracy is mostly lost outside the transition zone @xmath54 due to the fact that @xmath76 is achieved only at infinity .",
    "this can be dealt with by redefining the parameters to have both the exact slope at @xmath52 and the right value at @xmath80 , which produces @xmath81 this ` adjusted ' arctan gives the maximum error within @xmath82 for @xmath50 ; and even for as large a separation as @xmath71 the error is still about @xmath83 .",
    "same as  ( [ eq : univ_lin ] ) and  ( [ eq : univ_atan ] ) , the dependence  ( [ eq : univ_atan1 ] ) is shown in fig",
    "@xmath84 versus @xmath39 is plotted in fig .",
    "2 ; note a relative flatness of the of the function .",
    "= 0.6    fig .",
    "dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath39 .",
    "the explicit formula for the trapped flux can also be obtained , though not that easily , from equation  ( [ eq : univ_series ] ) , however , a direct way to get it is to integrate the closed form expression for the magnetic field through the pick - up loop plane @xmath30 . for this plane @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( the polar radius ) ; in addition , we can redefine @xmath33 by setting @xmath88 .",
    "then equations  ( [ eq : psi - closed ] ) and  ( [ eq : magnfield ] ) provide the needed component of the magnetic field in the form : @xmath89 \\label{eq : magnfield_z0}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 now we need to integrate  ( [ eq : magnfield_z0 ] ) over the area of the pick - up loop .",
    "first we calculate the simple , though rather cumbersome , algebraic integral of the field  ( [ eq : magnfield_z0 ] ) times @xmath91 over the polar radius from @xmath92 to @xmath29 ( if instead one first integrates over @xmath33 , elliptic integrals of a complicated argument appear in the result that make the closed form radial integration very difficult )",
    ". as we are then to integrate over the period of @xmath93 , the terms _ odd _ in @xmath94 can be omitted , and we obtain : @xmath95 \\label{eq : flux_1int}\\ ] ] in view of  ( [ eq : xy ] ) , this integration is also rather straightforward and leads to the desired result : @xmath96 \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : flux_closed}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the complete elliptic integral of the third kind ( see  @xcite , ch.ix ) . as a consistency check , one may calculate the saturation value and the derivative at zero of the transfer function  ( [ eq : flux_closed ] ) to see that they are indeed equal to the previously obtained values  ( [ eq : fd ] ) and  ( [ eq : kd ] ) .",
    "the first term in  ( [ eq : flux_closed ] ) evidently has a jump discontinuity at @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , for all finite @xmath39 , the second term must contain the discontinuity of the opposite sign , to make the sum of two analytical in @xmath45 .",
    "hence for small positive @xmath39 in the transition zone we are dealing with a small difference of two large quantities , which is always a problem . also , the first term in  ( [ eq : flux_closed ] ) coincides exactly with the expression ( 12 ) for @xmath47 , hence the second one should disappear in this limit , which it necessarily does in a very nonuniform way .",
    "evidently , such an expression can not be effectively used for both numerical and analytical purposes when @xmath39 is small enough , which is our case .",
    "now we need to determine the time signature @xmath100 of a fluxon polar angle in the pick - up loop frame , to complete the investigation of the trapped flux signal .    in doing that we use four cartesian coordinate systems .",
    "the first one , @xmath101 , has been introduced in sec .",
    "i ; it is fastened to the pick  up loop , and @xmath102 is the unit vector normal to the loop plane . the second coordinate system , @xmath103 , is associated with the roll axis of the spacecraft , @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "the roll axis is almost in the pick - up loop plane , that is , the roll axis ",
    "pick - up loop plane misalignment @xmath105 is very small .",
    "the third set of coordinates , @xmath106 , is related to the angular momentum vector @xmath107 in a way that @xmath108 .",
    "both @xmath109 and @xmath110coordinates are fixed in the inertial space , since the roll axis is pointed to the guide star , and we can so far neglect the pointing errors , as well as the relativistic drift of @xmath107 .",
    "we choose axes @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the plane containing both @xmath113 and @xmath114 , then the perpendicular to this plane axes @xmath115 and @xmath116 coincide ( fig .",
    "4 ) , and the following relations are true : @xmath117 @xmath118 here @xmath119 is the roll axis ",

    "3 . mutual orientation of roll and loop coordinates .",
    "= 0.6    fig .",
    "4 . mutual orientation of roll and angular momentum coordinates .    a symmetric top with the moment of inertia @xmath121 relative to the body symmetry axis and equal and slightly different value @xmath122 for the moments of inertia about the other two axes is a very good model for the gp - b rotors ( note that @xmath123 for them ) .",
    "therefore , we choose the fourth cartesian coordinate system @xmath124 fixed in the rotor s body with @xmath125 directed along the rotor s symmetry axis .",
    "the dynamics of a symmetric rotor is well known and relatively simple ( c. f.  @xcite ) .",
    "its motion in the @xmath110-coordinates is a precession about @xmath114 with the spin frequency @xmath126 and rotation about the rotor symmetry axis @xmath125 with the frequency @xmath127 @xmath128 is the angle between @xmath114 and @xmath125 .    for the signal of the trapped field",
    "we need , however , the time dependence of the position of a fluxon in the inertial coordinates , hence we need expressions of @xmath129 in terms of @xmath130 .",
    "the latter is found with the help of the euler angles ( see for instance  @xcite ) in the form @xmath131",
    "@xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 here the spin and polhode phases are @xmath136 and @xmath137 is a polhode frequency , @xmath138 ( in the body - fixed frame the instant angular velocity vector rotates around the rotor s symmetry axis with the polhode frequency ) .",
    "using this , we obtain the following expression for the unit vector @xmath139 in the direction of a fluxon ( i. e. , of an arbitrary fixed point of the rotor surface at some polar , @xmath140 , and azimuthal , @xmath141 , angles in the body - fixed spherical coordinates ) : @xmath142 @xmath143+\\cos\\xi\\sin\\gamma_b\\cos\\theta_s(t)\\ ] ] @xmath144+\\cos\\xi\\sin\\gamma_b\\sin\\theta_s(t)\\ ] ] @xmath145    according to the results of sec .",

    "as readily seen , the amplitudes of _ odd _ harmonics of @xmath164 ( @xmath172 ) are generally of the order of unity and decrease as @xmath173 for the large enough number @xmath174 .",

    "the majority of fluxon positions provide signals like the one drawn in the solid line in the figure .",
    "the dashed and dash - dotted lines correspond to rare fluxons oscillating in the small ( @xmath205 ) vicinity of the pick - up loop plane , which is why their amplitude is smaller . on the average , one can not expect too many fluxons like that , however , each of the four gp - b rotors will carry just one _ particular _ realization of the fluxon position distribution , so these ` weak ' fluxons are possible .",

    "5,c ) , while the remaining 40 are used to create a total net flux of @xmath207 along some random axis . this should account for a small residual magnetization of the rotor at the time when it was made superconducting ( see@xcite ) .",
    "this magnetization not only significantly increases the amplitude of the signal , but also smoothes it out .",
