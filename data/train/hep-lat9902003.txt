    "an important concept characterizing the confining force of non - abelian gauge theories is the potential of a pair of static charges separated by a distance @xmath5 . for charges in the fundamental representation ,",
    "confinement in yang mills theories in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions manifests itself in a gauge string formed between the charges , which leads to a potential rising linearly with the charge separation .",
    "when fundamental representation matter fields are added , this linear rise extends only to some distance @xmath0 at which there is enough energy in the gauge string to pair - create matter particles .",
    "these screen the confining force and the potential stays at a constant value , corresponding to the energy of two bound states of a static source and a dynamical particle .",
    "if the charges are in the adjoint representation , again a linear rise in the potential is observed . in this case , however , screening via string breaking is expected to occur even in pure yang mills theory , since the adjoint string can couple to gluons which may be pair - produced .",
    "the static potential itself is only defined up to an arbitrary constant .",
    "this is apparent from its divergence ( linear in 4  dimensions , logarithmic in 3  dimensions ) , which can not be absorbed in a parameter of the theory .",
    "however , there are two physical quantities which can be extracted from the potential : ( i ) the strength of the confining force as a function of distance , @xmath6 , is specified by the slope of the potential ; defines the string tension . for screened potentials ,",
    "this limit is zero and can not be used to define a string tension in the linear part . ]",
    "( ii ) the string breaking scale @xmath0 , where the screening of the charges sets in , gives the range of the force . while , for a given strength of the force , the string breaking scale in the fundamental representation potential depends on the bare mass of the matter fields ( it takes less energy to pair - produce lighter particles ) , it is a purely dynamical scale in the adjoint representation , which can not be tuned by any bare parameter of the theory .",
    "hence , like the string tension , it represents an independent , non - perturbative dynamical scale characterizing the physics of confinement .    despite a lot of effort",
    ", the screening phenomenon has not yet been observed in numerical simulations of qcd with dynamical fermions using the standard method of measuring large wilson loops @xcite .",
    "likewise , wilson loop calculations have also failed to exhibit string breaking for the adjoint potential in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite , and the evidence in 3 + 1 dimensions is somewhat inconclusive @xcite .",
    "however , recently string breaking was observed in the fundamental potential in the confinement phase of the su(2 ) higgs model in 2 + 1 @xcite and 3 + 1 @xcite dimensions by means of a mixing analysis . in those references",
    "it was demonstrated clearly that the wilson loop has very poor overlap with the screened two - meson final state , and hence is not suitable to extract the static potential for distances larger than the string breaking scale @xmath0 . instead , the simulations have to be supplemented by operators which have a good projection onto the two - meson state , and an analysis of mixing between the string and the two - meson states has to be performed for every distance @xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion has been corroborated by two further works .",
    "string breaking was also seen in qcd at finite temperatures @xcite , where polyakov loops rather than wilson loops have been used . at zero temperature",
    ", the potential beyond the screening length has been extracted in a quenched qcd simulation employing operators which show good overlap with the screened final state @xcite .",
    "finally , a recent calculation in three - dimensional su(2 ) gauge theory coupled to staggered fermions has laid claim to the observation of string breaking by measuring wilson loops on asymmetric lattices  @xcite .    in this paper , we employ the mixing analysis that has successfully been applied to observe string breaking in the su(2 ) higgs model @xcite to study the static potential of adjoint representation charges in 2 + 1 dimensional su(2 ) yang mills theory .",
    "we obtain clear evidence for string breaking and calculate the breaking scale @xmath0 in the continuum limit .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the operators used in the calculation , section 3 summarizes the simulation and the variational calculation used to extract the potential .",
    "our numerical results are presented in section 4 , a brief discussion of the results as well as our conclusions are contained in section 5 .",
    "we consider su(2 ) pure gauge theory with the wilson action s[u]= _ g _ x _ i < j , where @xmath7 denotes a plaquette of links @xmath8 in the fundamental representation ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the bare gauge coupling of mass dimension 1/2 .",
    "the links in the adjoint representation , @xmath11 , are related to the @xmath8 s by a^ab(x ) = ( ^a u_(x)^b u^_(x ) ) , where @xmath12 are the pauli matrices . with these definitions the operator describing two static adjoint sources with an adjoint representation flux tube between them , i.e. the correlation function of a string of length @xmath5 over a time interval @xmath13 , is just the adjoint representation wilson loop , g_ss(r , t)=w_adj(r , t)= ( w(r , t ) ^2 -1 ) , where w(r , t)=is the standard wilson loop and @xmath14 is a shorthand notation for the straight line of fundamental links connecting the sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the static potential in the adjoint representation is then defined in terms of the exponential decay of the wilson loop , [ defpot ] v(r)=-_t . in the region of linear confinement",
    "the wilson loop obeys the area law , whereas for distances beyond the breaking scale @xmath0 a perimeter law is expected . in practical simulations ,",
    "the limit @xmath17 is not realized , but @xmath13 is typically less than ten lattice spacings when the signal is lost in noise .",
    "as we shall see , due to the poor projection of the wilson loop onto the screened potential , this is not sufficient to observe string breaking , and one has to use additional operators with good projection onto the final state .",
    "the correlation function for a bound state of a static adjoint colour source and a gluon field , sometimes called gluelump in the literature @xcite , is given by the non - local gauge - invariant operator [ lump ] g_g(t ) & = & ( p(x ) ^a ) ^ab(t ) ( p^(y)^b ) + & = & with the adjoint representation wilson line ^ab(t)=(^a u(x , y ) ^b u^(x , y ) ) , y = x+t . here ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the `` clover - leaf '' of all four plaquettes with the same orientation , which emanate from the endpoints  @xmath20 of the adjoint wilson line into the @xmath21-plane  @xcite .",
    "we now follow the procedure proposed in @xcite and construct an operator projecting on two of these bound states at distance @xmath5 by [ mm ] g_gg(r , t ) & = & .",
    "finally , correlations between a string and a gluelump state , and vice versa , may be described by g_sg(r , t ) & = & , + g_gs(r , t ) & = & .",
    "the static potential , its excitations and the mixing between gauge string and two - meson state can then be extracted from measurements of the matrix correlator g(r , t ) = (    ll g_ss(r , t ) & g_sg(r , t ) + g_gs(r , t ) & g_gg(r , t )    ) .",
    "[ eq_matcor ] we also keep the single gluelump operator @xmath22 from ( [ lump ] ) in our simulations , in order to check whether @xmath23 defined in ( [ mm ] ) indeed has a good projection onto a two - gluelump state , for which one expects @xmath24 .",
    "hence , our procedure is entirely analogous to the one applied in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "there , the operator with explicit projection onto a two - meson state , @xmath25 , plays the same role as the two - gluelump operator @xmath23 considered in this work .",
    "note that the energy levels extracted from the operator @xmath22 in eq.([lump ] ) are logarithmically divergent with decreasing lattice spacing and hence do not have a continuum limit .",
    "this divergence is due to the self - energy of the static source which , although perturbatively computable , can not be absorbed by renormalization into a parameter of the theory . for a detailed discussion of this point , as well as a perturbative computation and subtraction of the divergence , see @xcite .",
    "for the computation of the string breaking scale , however , this divergence does not pose a problem .",
    "first , we observe that all operators @xmath26 used in the matrix correlator @xmath27 contain two temporal wilson lines and hence the same divergence ( it is the temporal lines whose length is taken to infinity that represent the propagation of the static sources in the definition of the potential , eq.([defpot ] ) ) .",
    "this divergence appears in the energy values of the static potential , which therefore do not have a continuum limit .",
    "this is well known , and exactly the same holds if only wilson loops are used .",
    "it reflects the fact that the static potential is defined only up to an arbitrary ( infinite ) constant , and does not itself constitute a finite physical quantity .",
    "on the other hand , the confining force and the string breaking scale are finite physical quantities .",
    "the force is defined by the slope of the static potential , and the string breaking scale by the equality of the energy stored in the string and the energy needed to pair - produce the constituents needed to form gluelump states .",
    "hence , both quantities are defined by energy differences such that the divergence cancels out and these quantities do have a continuum limit .",
    "all of these features can be seen explicitly in our calculations .",
    "we now describe the details of our numerical work . it is well known that the projection properties of operators can be significantly improved by using smeared link variables in the spatial directions . for this purpose , and to create a larger basis of operators ,",
    "we have employed the standard fuzzing algorithm @xcite to obtain smeared spatial link variables of unit length , which were then used instead of the original ones in constructing the correlation functions defined above .",
    "all links in the time directions were left unsmeared such that the transfer matrix remains unaffected by our smearing procedure . as a basis of operators used in the matrix correlator eq .",
    "( [ eq_matcor ] ) , we chose three different link fuzzing levels for the spatial wilson lines and three or five fuzzing levels for the clover - leaves @xmath28 .",
    "with increasing number of iterations in the fuzzing algorithm we have also increased the size of the clover - leaves by powers of two , starting from the simplest choice of @xmath29 plaquettes at the lowest fuzzing level , up to @xmath30 at the highest .",
    "depending on the number of fuzzing levels used to compute the clover - leaves , our correlator @xmath27 represents a @xmath31 or @xmath32 matrix .",
    "this size of the basis has been sufficient to yield good projection onto the first two lowest states in the calculation of the fundamental representation potential @xcite . for the single gluelump operator our basis",
    "consists of five different fuzzing levels .",
    "the procedure we follow to diagonalize @xmath27 by means of a variational calculation has been described in detail in the literature @xcite , and its application to the calculation of the adjoint potential has already been discussed @xcite . here",
    "we outline the procedure once more for the current problem . for the sake of clarity",
    "we assume that all links have been transferred to the temporal gauge , where the links in the time direction are set to unity .",
    "this choice greatly simplifies the notation , and since all @xmath26 are manifestly gauge - invariant , the physics remains unchanged .",
    "we then note that each of the @xmath26 represents a correlation function which can be written as g_ij(r , t)=_i(t ) _",
    "j(0 ) . here",
    "the @xmath33 s represent a spatial gauge string of length @xmath5 at different fuzzing levels for @xmath34 , and a two - gluelump operator at different fuzzing levels for @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "the variational diagonalization of @xmath27 consists in solving the generalized eigenvalue problem @xcite g(r , t)v_i(t , t_0)=_i(t , t_0)g(r , t_0)v_i(t , t_0),t > t_0",
    ". from the eigenvectors @xmath37 one may construct the corresponding eigenstates _",
    "i = c_i_k v_k^i_k=_k a_ik _ k , [ eq_eigenstate ] which are superpositions of the string and gluelump operators used in the simulation .",
    "the constants @xmath38 are chosen such that @xmath39 is normalized to unity .",
    "the diagonalized correlation matrix may then be written as [ diag ] _",
    "i(r , t ) = _ i(t ) _",
    "i(0 ) = _ j , k=1^na_ija_ik_j(t ) _ k(0)= _ j , k=1^na_ija_ikg_jk(t ) , and represents the ( approximate ) correlation functions of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "we extract the energies corresponding to the states @xmath39 by fitting a single exponential to these correlation functions @xcite , _",
    "i(r , t)~e^-e_i t . to check the stability of the procedure",
    "we have performed the same calculation for @xmath40 and obtained consistent results in all cases . due to the normalization of the @xmath39 , the coefficients @xmath41 take values between zero and one .",
    "they quantify the overlap of each individual correlator @xmath42 with the correlators of the mass eigenstates , @xmath43 , and play a crucial role in the mixing analysis of the numerical results .",
    "since all operators are gauge - invariant , the same considerations apply without fixing a gauge , only the notation becomes more involved . in this case",
    "adjoint wilson lines have to be inserted between the @xmath44 s in eq.([diag ] ) , but the @xmath43 are still expressed by the last of eq.([diag ] ) .",
    "we have worked at three values of the bare gauge coupling , @xmath45 .",
    "our chosen lattice sizes correspond to @xmath46 . at @xmath47",
    "we also considered @xmath48 in order to check for finite size effects .",
    "for all values of @xmath49 we have employed a maximum of 18 iterations of the fuzzing algorithm with a link / staple mixing ratio of 2.0 , which was sufficient to observe saturation in the projection onto the ground state . at @xmath50 measurements",
    "were taken after every compound update consisting of 5 over - relaxed and one heat - bath sweeps .",
    "for @xmath51 we increased the number of over - relaxed sweeps between measurements to 10 .",
    "typically , it was sufficient to collect between 500 and 1000 measurements in bins of 20 - 50 to obtain a satisfactory signal .",
    "statistical errors were estimated using a jackknife procedure .",
    "we begin the presentation of our numerical results with the spectrum of a single gluelump state , as given in table [ glen ] .",
    "this operator has been previously computed in @xcite , and we observe good agreement with the values reported in @xcite . upon conversion to physical units ,",
    "i.e. @xmath52 , one observes a slight increase in @xmath53 as the continuum limit is approached , which may signal the onset of the weak logarithmic divergence discussed in section  2 .       using the estimates for @xmath54 as determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq_deltae ] ) we have extrapolated @xmath55 linearly in @xmath56 to the continuum limit , using the data points for which @xmath57 .",
    "we find r_bg^2 = 6.500.94 .",
    "expressing @xmath0 in units of the scalar glueball mass , for which we take @xmath58 @xcite the result is r_bm_g = 10.3 1.5 .",
    "[ eq_rbmg ] in other words , the energy scale @xmath59 turns out to be smaller by an order of magnitude compared with the lightest physical state of the theory .",
    "we can now interpret our findings in the framework of the string picture .",
    "one would expect that at the breaking scale the energy of the flux tube is roughly equal to the energy of the lightest bound state consisting of the constituent fields which are pair - produced .",
    "for the adjoint string one would naively expect that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the slope of the linear part in the potential , and @xmath62 is , as before , the lightest glueball .",
    "therefore , in order to test the string picture we have compared the ratio @xmath63 to the estimate for @xmath61 which was extracted from the linear part of the potential . using our result in eq .",
    "( [ eq_rbmg ] ) we find that the relation @xmath64 is satisfied at the 20% level . in view of the many caveats surrounding this analysis , such as the determination of @xmath61 itself and the effects of the binding energy between the pair - produced gluons",
    ", one can not expect a much better quantitative agreement .",
    "however , the main purpose of this discussion is to argue that even only a roughly quantitative confirmation of @xmath65 would suggest that the situation in the four - dimensional theory is not much different .",
    "therefore one might expect to find a similar estimate of the breaking scale in units of @xmath62 in four dimensions .    to summarize , we have shown that the same type of variational calculation which has previously been successful in detecting string breaking in yang mills theory with fundamental matter , can also be applied to confirm the phenomenon in the potential with adjoint sources .",
    "in addition to calculating the breaking scale of the adjoint string in pure yang mills theory , we have computed the energies of a few excited states .",
    "we found a repeating pattern of potentials whose energies increase with the separation  @xmath5 up to the point where the sources support two gluelumps , at least one of which may be excited .    in view of these results",
    "there is little doubt that a similar picture will be obtained in the four - dimensional theory . in order to work towards more realistic models",
    ", one could also study the influence of fundamental matter fields on the value of the breaking scale obtained with adjoint sources .",
    "we leave these issues for future work , noting that recent lattice simulations have also studied similar systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is considerable phenomenological interest in these models , since adjoint fermion fields are contained as gluinos in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
