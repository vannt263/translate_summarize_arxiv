    "the interaction of ultraintense lasers with jets of molecular clusters or nanodroplets ( with typical size in the range @xmath0 nm and containing @xmath1 particles ) is a central research topic @xcite , with important applications , such as tabletop nuclear fusion for compact neutron sources @xcite , or the laboratory investigations of nucleosynthesis reactions , relevant to astrophysical scenarios @xcite .",
    "clustered media can be regarded as sparse distributions of tiny solid targets , a peculiar configuration that allows for both a deep penetration of the laser radiation and a strong laser - matter coupling with many individual , overdense targets , thus providing extremely efficient energy absorption @xcite .",
    "when hit by an ultraintense laser beam , the neutral atoms in a cluster are promptly ionized ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis of the concurring ionization mechanisms in different laser / cluster configurations ) and a dense `` nanoplasma '' @xcite is formed .",
    "the free electrons then absorb energy from the laser pulse @xcite and start expanding , causing the formation of strong electric fields , which lead to efficient ion acceleration , as first predicted by dawson @xcite . when the energy transferred to the electrons is much smaller than the electrostatic energy stored in the ion core , charge separation is localized to regions much smaller than the cluster @xcite , which then remains quasi - neutral and undergoes a hydrodynamic - like expansion @xcite ; in opposite conditions ( e.g. with small deuterium clusters exposed to extremely intense laser radiation ) the electrons suddenly escape from the cluster and the remaining bare - ion distribution undergoes a pure coulomb explosion ( ce ) @xcite . in intermediate situations ,",
    "the expansion dynamics is a mixture of the phenomenology of the two limits , with the expansion process being strongly dependent on the self - consistent dynamics of ions and trapped electrons @xcite . when increasing the laser energy , or when lowering the cluster size and density , the expansion conditions vary smoothly from quasi - neutral , hydrodynamic - like regimes to pure ce regimes , as confirmed by particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite of the self - consistent laser - cluster interaction and by kinetic or fluid modeling of the expansion of finite - size , non - quasi - neutral plasma expansions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the expansion regime can be controlled by regulating the amount of energy transferred to the electrons @xcite , which can be obtained with appropriately shaped laser beams .",
    "an important example is the irradiation of homonuclear deuterium clusters with two sequential laser pulses having different intensities @xcite . in this way , one can taylor the expansion dynamics so as to induce overrunning between ions and the consequent formation of expanding shells containing multiple ion flows . within such structures (",
    "here denoted as `` shock shells '' , following the terminology in @xcite ) , the relative velocities between deuterium ions from different flows can be sufficiently high for energetic collisions and _ dd _ fusion reactions to occurr @xcite .",
    "since these intracluster reactions occur early in the expansion , and before different exploding clusters overlap , they are expected to produce a time resolved burst of fusion neutrons before the bulk neutron signal due to intercluster reactions @xcite . in the case of heteronuclear clusters , e.g. deuterium - tritium clusters ,",
    "ion species having different charge - to - mass ratios expand with different velocities making intracluster , interspecies reactions possible also with standard single - pulse irradiation @xcite .",
    "this paper provides an organic review of the work on controlled expansions of clusters and nanoplasmas published in @xcite , complemented with novel simulation results obtained with a recently developed molecular - dynamics technique @xcite . in the following",
    ", the transition to the ce regime is analyzed with a self - consistent kinetic model ( section [ sec : expansion ] ) , the concept of shock shell is briefly reviewed ( section [ sec : shocks ] ) , and the possibility of achieving intracluster nuclear reactions in homonuclear clusters @xcite by driving a slow expansion followed by a sudden ce @xcite is explored ( section [ sec : reactions ] ) .",
    "in order to analyze the influence of the electrons on the expansion dynamics , a kinetic model for the collisionless expansion of a spherically symmetric nanoplasma has been developed @xcite , based on the assumptions that the electrons are nonrelativistic and resorting to the large mass disparity between electrons and ions .",
    "the expansion process is divided in two stages : an initial charging transient with frozen ions , and the long term expansion of both ions and electrons . in the second stage ,",
    "the expansion dynamics is described self - consistently by following the radial motion of the cold ions , while accounting for the three - dimensional dynamics of the hot electrons using a sequence of `` ergodic '' equilibrium configurations @xcite , represented by stationary solutions of the vlasov equation that depend on the total energy @xmath2 only .",
    "the electron density instantaneously in equilibrium with the electrostatic potential @xmath3 can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 indicates functional dependence on @xmath3 , @xmath6 is the energy distribution of the electrons , and @xmath7^{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\mathrm{d}r}^{\\prime}$ ] is the probability density of finding an electron having total energy @xmath8 at the radial position @xmath9 .",
    "the self - consistent potential @xmath3 satisfies the nonlinear poisson equation @xmath10 $ ] . by resorting to the theory of adiabatic invariants for time varying hamiltonians @xcite , a closed set of equations",
    "is then obtained in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the ion mass and charge , respectively .",
    "equations and , determining the ion trajectory @xmath14 ( @xmath15 : initial radius ) and the evolution of the electron energy @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : initial energy ) , are coupled with the nonlinear poisson equation . in eq . , the relation @xmath18 has been used , where @xmath19 is the energy distribution of the electrons resulting from the initial charging transient , a fast process that can not be described by equations ",
    "the self - consistent shape of @xmath19 is determined by a virtual charging transient , in which the ions stay immobile , while an external potential barrier , initially confining the electrons , is gradually moved from @xmath20 to infinity , with a series of small radial displacements ( the validity of this procedure has been confirmed by particle - in - cell simulations @xcite and ad - hoc solutions of the vp model @xcite ) .",
    "the initial , nonequilibrium electron distribution is assumed to be a maxwellian , with temperature @xmath21 , so that the whole expansion dynamics is fully determined by the single dimensionless parameter @xmath22 ( @xmath23 : maximum ion energy attainable from the ce of a uniform ion sphere with radius @xmath20 and total charge @xmath24 ; @xmath25 : initial electron debye length ) , which accounts for both the initial electron temperature and the cluster size and density .    the positive charge buildup at the ion front , @xmath26 , and the mean kinetic energy of the trapped electrons , @xmath27 , as functions of @xmath28 ,",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : qeq_teq ] .",
    "simple fits for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are found as @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath33 ) ,",
    "the fits reduce to @xmath34 , thus recovering the theoretical results for planar expansions @xcite , and to @xmath35 .    when the initial equilibrium is reached and the ions are allowed to expand , gaining kinetic energy , the electrons cool down and the charge buildup decreases ( until a ballistic regime is reached for both species @xcite ) . depending on the value of @xmath28 ,",
    "such behavior strongly affects the ion dynamics and the resulting distribution of ion energy @xcite : for @xmath36 , the spectrum is monotonic as in a ce ; for @xmath37 , it exhibits a local maximum far from the cutoff energy , thus being qualitatively different from the ce case . in this respect ,",
    "the transition value @xmath38 can be considered as the lower bound for the validity of the ce approximation .",
    "the cutoff energy is fit by @xmath39 , which , for @xmath40 , reduces to @xmath41 ; for @xmath37 , the location of the maximum is fit by the power - law @xmath42 .",
    "these scaling laws , valid for any combination of @xmath20 , @xmath43 , and @xmath21 , can be useful to interpret experimental data @xcite .",
    "in the absence of electrons , the explosion dynamics of a spherical distribution of cold ions is described by equation , which reduces to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of ions enclosed by a sphere of radius @xmath9 at time @xmath46 .",
    "if the initial profile of ion density is uniform and step - like ( i.e. @xmath47 for @xmath48 ) , the repulsive electric field grows linearly for @xmath49 , reaching its maximum at the outer boundary , which causes the outer ions to be always faster than the inner ones .",
    "thus , ions never overtake each other , @xmath45 is conserved along the ion trajectories ( so is the total energy of each ion ) , and the equation of motion can be integrated analytically @xcite , yielding , for ions initially at rest , the expansion velocity @xmath50^{1/2}r_0\\omega{_{\\mathrm{pi}}}$ ] , where @xmath51 is the initial ion plasma frequency . the radial trajectory is then given , in implicit form , by @xmath52^{1/2 } + \\log[\\xi{_{\\mathrm{i}}}^{1/2}+(\\xi{_{\\mathrm{i}}}-1)^{1/2 } ] = ( 2/3)^{1/2}\\omega{_{\\mathrm{pi}}}t$ ] , where @xmath53 is the expansion factor . in this solution",
    ", @xmath54 is independent of @xmath15 , the @xmath55 phase - space profile is always a straight line with equation @xmath56^{1/2}\\omega{_{\\mathrm{pi}}}r$ ] , and the ion density maintains its step - like form , decreasing in time as @xmath57 . the asymptotic ion energy distribution is @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ionspectrum_t0 ] ) .    if , more realistically , nonuniform density profiles are considered , the expansion features change qualitatively @xcite : when the initial density is a decreasing function of @xmath9 , the repulsive coulomb field reaches its maximum within the ion sphere @xcite , leading to ion overtaking and to the formation of multiple - flow regions ( shock shells ) with characteristic multi - branched phase - space profile as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] ( since the ion trajectories are no longer independent of one another , the above analytical solution no longer holds @xcite ) .",
    "the physical interest of these shock shells resides in the appearance of multiple flows with large relative velocities within a single exploding cluster , which can lead to energetic ion - ion collisions and to intracluster reactions in homonuclear clusters @xcite .",
    "an effective strategy to produce large - scale shock shells in a controlled fashion is combining different expansion regimes so that a slow hydrodynamic - like expansion , providing a smoothly decreasing ion - density profile , is followed by an abrupt ce .",
    "this is achievable with a double - pump irradiation scheme as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] , wherein a weak pulse ( intensity : @xmath59 ; duration : @xmath60 ) is followed by a strong pulse ( intensity : @xmath61 ; duration : @xmath62 ) , with suitable time delay @xmath63 : @xmath59 must be sufficiently high to ionize the atoms , creating a nanoplasma , but not so high as to expel a significant fraction of the electrons from the cluster , whereas @xmath64 must be high enough to drive a sudden ce . in these conditions ,",
    "a pronounced shock shell is formed , whose features are determined by the key double - pump parameters , namely @xmath59 and @xmath63 , which strongly affects the density profile of the cluster when being hit by the second laser . the effectiveness of the technique has been demonstrated @xcite by resorting to two- and three - dimensional pic simulations performed using the osiris 2.0 framework @xcite , closely matching realistic physical scenarios .",
    "the ability of producing multiple flows with high relative velocities within single exploding clusters makes the phenomenon attractive as a possible way to induce intracluster fusion reactions in homonuclear deuterium clusters . as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", the rates for intracluster reactions can be significantly higher than those for intercluster reactions , because the typical densities within a shock shell ( @xmath65 @xmath66 ) are higher than those within the hot plasma filament resulting from the exploded clusters ( @xmath67 @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , it is crucial to consider also that the expanding shock - shell stays appreciably dense only for a very brief time ( @xmath68 fs ) , much shorter than the typical disassembly time of the plasma filament ( @xmath69 ps ) : as shown in @xcite , the rates of intracluster reactions exhibit a sharp , time - resolved peak right after the shock - shell formation . once the expansion dynamics is known , the number of intracluster fusion reactions is obtained by summing over all possible contributions from collisions between ions belonging to different velocity branches in a shock shell ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] ) .",
    "the number of reactions per unit time and volume , @xmath70 , is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the cross section for _ dd _ fusion , while @xmath73 and @xmath74 indicate , respectively , the ion density and velocity on the @xmath75th branch .",
    "the number of intracluster fusion reactions , @xmath76 , is obtained by integrating @xmath70 over time and space , as @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are the shock - shell boundaries and formation time , respectively . in @xcite ,",
    "the influence of the double - pump parameters on @xmath76 was analyzed using a simple 1d model wherein the laser field of the first pulse gradually strips the initially neutral cluster of a part of its electrons according to a cluster barrier suppression ionization ( cbsi ) model ( cf . ref .",
    "this provided preliminary estimates for the optimal combinations of delay and intensities that maximize @xmath76 , and suggested that , for very large clusters ( @xmath81 nm ) , the intracluster reaction yield can become comparable with the intercluster neutron yield , with @xmath82 of the fusion reactions arising from intracluster collisions @xcite .    accurate calculations of the intracluster reaction yields achievable with the double - pump irradiation of homonuclear deuterium clusters are currently being performed resorting to three - dimensional molecular - dynamics simulations based on the recently developed scaled electron and ion dynamics ( seid ) technique @xcite , for different values of laser intensities , durations , and delays .",
    "preliminary results indicate that , with @xmath59 in the range @xmath83 w@xmath84 , @xmath60 in the range @xmath85 fs , @xmath86 w@xmath84 , @xmath87 fs , and @xmath63 in the range @xmath88 fs , the number of intracluster reaction per cluster can be as high as @xmath89 with a cluster size @xmath90 nm . these values are comparable with the estimate in @xcite ; furthermore , as predicted in @xcite , it is found that the optimal intensities of the first pulse are significantly lower , typically by an order of magnitude , than those estimated with the cbsi model .",
    "calculations based on the seid technique are being performed also in the case of heteronuclear deuterium - tritium clusters and nanodroplets irradiated by a single laser pulse , for either homogenous mixtures or layered targets composed by a deuterium core surrounded by a tritium shell .",
    "owing to the higher value of the deuterium - tritium fusion cross section for the energy range considered , higher number of intracluster reactions , on the order of @xmath91 , are obtained with respect to the pure - deuterium case .",
    "detailed results of these numerical simulations will be presented in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the ergodic model has been used to simulate the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas driven by energetic electrons over a wide range of values of plasma size , plasma density , and initial electron thermal energy , combined in the single dimensionless parameter @xmath28 : a qualitative change in the shape of the asymptotic energy spectrum of the ions when approaching the coulomb explosion regime has been identified and accurate fit laws for the relevant expansion features have been provided .",
    "the douple - pump irradiation technique to induce the formation of multiple ion flows during the expansion of large homonuclear deuterium clusters or nanodroplets has been described , and its applicability to produce intracluster _",
    "dt _ fusion reactions has been proved resorting to three - dimensional numerical simulations performed with a recently developed scaled molecular dynamics technique .",
