    "the study of chiral symmetry breaking has a long history , beginning with the seminal work of nambu and jona - lasinio  @xcite .",
    "because of its simpler structure , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has widely been used to study chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "being inherently a nonperturbative phenomenon , the dynamical generation of a fermion mass in gauge theories is usually studied with the help of the schwinger - dyson equations truncated in certain schemes . an often used truncation scheme is the rainbow ( or quenched ladder ) approximation ( for a review see ref .",
    "it is generally difficult to find a consistent truncation scheme such that the resulting dynamical fermion mass is gauge ( fixing ) independent .",
    "a common practice has been to forgo gauge independence in favor of obtaining a nonperturbative solution . nevertheless , the demonstration of the gauge independence of physical quantities is of fundamental importance in gauge theories  @xcite . in perturbation",
    "theory the usual connection between the order of the loop expansion and powers of the gauge coupling guarantees that physical quantities calculated to a given order in the loop expansion are gauge independent . in other words , as is well known , loop expansion is a consistent expansion scheme in perturbation theory .",
    "such a connection however is lost in nonperturbative studies in which contributions of a given order in the gauge coupling arise from every order in the loop expansion . as a result , establishing the gauge independence of physical quantities obtained in a nonperturbative calculation ( e.g. , the schwinger - dyson equations ) is a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "this is because an infinite subset of diagrams arising from every order in the loop expansion has to be resummed consistently , thus leading to potential gauge dependence of physical quantities whenever not all relevant diagrams are accounted for .",
    "therefore , we emphasize that in gauge theories no truncation schemes of the schwinger - dyson equations should be considered consistent unless the gauge independence of physical quantities calculated therein is unequivocally demonstrated .    the problem of chiral symmetry breaking in qed in a strong , constant external magnetic field has received a lot of attention over the past decade  @xcite .",
    "it was originally motivated by a proposal  @xcite to explain the correlated @xmath3 peaks observed in heavy ion collision experiments  @xcite .",
    "the proposal posits that the @xmath3 peaks are produced from the decay of a bound @xmath3 system formed in a new metastable phase of qed with broken chiral symmetry , which is induced by the strong electromagnetic field present in the neighborhood of the colliding heavy ions .",
    "even though the @xmath3 events were not observed in a later experiment  @xcite , it is still an interesting question to ask whether background fields can induce chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the result of the investigation suggests that it may be relevant for studying the electroweak phase transition in the early universe when a strong magnetic field was present  @xcite .",
    "the methodology developed also found interesting applications in the study of color superconductivity in high density qcd  @xcite , superconductivity and magnetic field induced phase transitions in condensed matter systems  @xcite , as well as the properties of strongly magnetized astrophysical media  @xcite .    in a recent article  @xcite , we have found a consistent truncation scheme for the case of chiral symmetry breaking in a strong , constant external magnetic field .",
    "we critically examined the consistency and gauge independence of the bare vertex approximation that has been extensively used in truncating the schwinger - dyson equations to calculate the dynamical fermion mass generated through chiral symmetry breaking in weakly coupled qed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we showed that the bare vertex approximation , in which the vertex corrections are ignored , is a consistent truncation of the schwinger - dyson equations in the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "the dynamical fermion mass , obtained as the solution of the truncated schwinger - dyson equations evaluated _ on the fermion mass shell _ , is manifestly gauge independent .",
    "this novel gauge independent approach poses a serious question on the validity of the results and conclusions obtained in earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , it leads to a consistent , nonperturbative calculation of the dynamical fermion mass to leading order in the gauge coupling , and allows one to identify the infinite subset of diagrams that contribute to chiral symmetry breaking in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold . on the one hand , we present the technical details of the results outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite . to begin with , we critically review the properties of the so - called @xmath4 functions , first introduced by ritus  @xcite in the studies of qed in constant external electromagnetic fields . in doing so , we correct a few mistakes found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we also derive the ward - takahashi identity in the bare vertex approximation both within and beyond the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "this allows us to ( i ) correct a few oversights found in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( ii ) verify the conclusion obtained therein on the ward - takahashi identity in the bare vertex approximation and within the lowest landau level approximation , and ( iii ) show that the ward - takahashi identity in the bare vertex approximation can be satisfied only within the lowest landau level approximation . by utilizing the @xmath4 function formalism and the ward - takahashi identity in the bare vertex approximation , we prove that the bare vertex approximation is a consistent truncation of the schwinger - dyson equations in the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "in particular , we verify that ( i ) the truncated vacuum polarization is transverse , ( ii ) the truncated fermion self - energy evaluated on the fermion mass shell is manifestly gauge independent .    on the other hand , we provide a detailed comparison between our results and those obtained in the literature  @xcite . based on the gauge independent analysis presented in this article , we argue that to a large extent the results and conclusions obtained in those earlier studies can be attributed to inconsistent truncation schemes , gauge dependent artifacts , or both . along the way this detailed comparison also establishes several important aspects of the bare vertex approximation : ( i )",
    "the assumption of a momentum independent fermion self - energy , a consequence of the ward - takahashi identity in the bare vertex approximation , is reliable in the momentum region relevant to chiral symmetry breaking in a strong magnetic field .",
    "( ii ) while the extension to a momentum dependent fermion self - energy violates the ward - takahashi identity in the bare vertex approximation , the resultant gauge dependence of the dynamical fermion mass is of higher order .",
    "( iii ) in a strong magnetic field the dynamical fermion mass can be reliably calculated in the bare vertex approximation and is gauge independent up to corrections of higher order .",
    "( iv ) there exists a direct correspondence between the schwinger - dyson equations truncated in the bare vertex approximation and the nonperturbative approach based on the 2pi ( two - particle - irreducible ) effective action truncated at the lowest nontrivial order both in the loop expansion as well as in the @xmath0 expansion ( @xmath1 is the number of fermion flavors ) .",

    "[ sec : ep ] we critically review the properties of the ritus @xmath4 functions . in sec .",

    "the truncated on - shell schwinger - dyson equations are numerically solved for various numbers of fermion flavors , and an analytic fit for the dynamical fermion mass is obtained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we compare our results to those found in the literature .",

    "appendix : vc ] we show that the vacuum current vanishes identically in a constant external magnetic field .",
    "appendix  [ appendix:2pi ] provides a summary of some exact relations derived from the 2pi effective action that are useful to the discussion in the main text .",
    "in this section we critically review the properties of the @xmath4 functions , first introduced by ritus in his seminal work  @xcite .",
    "they form a complete set of dirac matrix - valued orthonormal functions and hence provide a convenient formalism in the studies of qed in the presence of a constant external magnetic field  @xcite . in doing so , a few mistakes and confusions found in the literature  @xcite are corrected and clarified .",

    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the _ external _ gauge field and @xmath11 is a dirac spinor . instead of solving eq .",
    "directly , we show that there exists a complete set of orthonormal functions , referred to in the literature as the ritus @xmath4 functions , such that in the basis spanned by the @xmath4 functions eq .",
    "is rendered formally identical to the dirac equation for a massless fermion in the _ absence _ of external fields .",
    "we will take the constant external magnetic field of strength @xmath12 in the @xmath13-direction with the corresponding vector potential given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 constitute a maximal set of mutually commuting operators . , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which have been omitted here for the sake of presentational simplicity . ]",
    "the @xmath4 functions are constructed in terms of the simultaneous eigenfunctions ( eigenvectors ) of these mutually commuting operators .",
    "the eigenfunction equation for @xmath16 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath23 .",
    "note that the subscript @xmath24 in @xmath22 denotes symbolically a set of quantum numbers yet to be determined . in the chiral representation in which @xmath25 and @xmath18 are both diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , the eigenfunctions @xmath22 have the general form @xmath28 where @xmath29 are bispinors which are the eigenvectors of @xmath25 and @xmath18 .",
    "the scalar functions @xmath30 are found to be given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a normalization factor , and @xmath33 denotes the parabolic cylinder functions  @xcite with argument @xmath34 and nonnegative integer index @xmath35 given by @xmath36 the nonnegative integer @xmath37 in eq .",
    "labels the landau levels with @xmath38 being the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "note that in the absence of an external electric field , the scalar functions @xmath30 do not depend on the chirality @xmath39 ( hence the notation used ) .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath23 of @xmath40 is identified as the momentum squared of a massless fermion in an external magnetic field .",
    "this can be understood by writing @xmath41 and noticing the following properties : @xmath42 where , here and henceforth , the subscript @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) refers to the longitudinal : @xmath45 ( transverse : @xmath46 ) components .",
    "hence , one finds @xmath47 with @xmath37 being the quantum number of the quantized transverse momentum squared and @xmath48 the energy gap between adjacent landau levels ( referred to henceforth as the landau energy ) .",
    "it is important to note that eq .",
    ", together with the nonnegativeness of @xmath49 , imposes a constraint on the allowed value of @xmath50 when @xmath38 , namely , @xmath51 this is one of the subtle points that has been overlooked in the previous literature  @xcite that utilizes the ritus @xmath4 functions .",
    "physically , the constraint on @xmath50 when @xmath38 means that the spin of the lll fermions is always aligned parallel to the external magnetic field .",
    "following ritus  @xcite , we construct the @xmath4 functions as the matrix of the simultaneous eigenfunctions ( eigenvectors ) of the maximal set of mutually commuting operators @xmath52 , viz , @xmath53 where a prime on the summation symbol means that it is subject to the constraint , and @xmath54 note that the subscript @xmath24 in @xmath55 denotes symbolically the set of quantum numbers @xmath56 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that ( no summation over repeated indices is implied ) @xmath57 hence the matrices @xmath58 can be identified as the projection operators on the fermion states with the spin parallel ( @xmath59 ) and antiparallel ( @xmath60 ) to the external magnetic field .",

    ".   differs from that quoted in the literature  @xcite , which is applicable _ only _ for fermions occupying higher landau levels ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the presence of the projection operator @xmath67 $ ] in the orthonormal condition of the @xmath4 functions for the lll fermions has an important physical consequence that is responsible for an effective dimensional reduction in the dynamics of fermion pairing in a strong external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath4 functions form a complete set of orthonormal dirac matrix - valued functions , they can be used as a basis for the hilbert space of the ( perturbative ) asymptotic massless fermion states in the presence of a constant external magnetic field . throughout this article",
    "we will refer to the space spanned by the @xmath4 functions simply as the momentum space whenever no confusion may arise .",
    "explicit calculation shows that the @xmath4 functions satisfy an important property @xmath68 where @xmath69 for notational simplicity , in eq .",
    "we have used the _ same _ notation @xmath24 to denote both symbolically the set of quantum numbers @xmath56 on the left - hand side ( lhs ) in @xmath55 , as well as literally the momentum @xmath70 on the right - hand side ( rhs ) in @xmath71 .",
    "however , we emphasize that the quantum number @xmath72 should _ not _ be confused with the component of the momentum @xmath24 in the @xmath73-direction , which is determined by the quantum number @xmath37 as can be seen from eq .  .",
    "we note that @xmath74 does not commute with @xmath25 and @xmath18 , hence it is _ not _ diagonal in the basis spanned by the @xmath4 functions , as is evident from eq .  .",

    "one obtains @xmath77 eq",
    ".   reveals clearly the advantage of the @xmath4 functions in the studies of qed in a constant external magnetic field : when expressed in the momentum space spanned by the @xmath4 functions , the ( bare ) inverse propagator for fermions in a constant external magnetic field is rendered _ formally _ identical to that in the absence of external fields ( up to the projection operator @xmath67 $ ] that accounts for the spin alignment of the lll fermions ) .",
    "we are now in a position to show that in the momentum space spanned by the @xmath4 functions , eq .",
    "is rendered formally identical to the dirac equation for a massless fermion in the absence of external fields .",
    "this is achieved by considering the dirac spinor in momentum space @xmath78 defined by @xmath79 where the momentum argument @xmath24 in @xmath78 is given by eq .  .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "that in momentum space eq .   reads @xmath80 which , as advertised in the beginning of this section , is formally the dirac equation for a massless fermion in the absence of external fields , and whose solutions are well known .",
    "the condition that eq .",
    "has nontrivial solutions is given by @xmath81 , which is exactly the mass shell condition for a massless particle .",
    "we emphasize that because the @xmath4 functions are not solutions of the free field dirac equation , they do _ not _ correspond to the ( perturbative ) asymptotic states of massless fermions in the presence of a constant external magnetic field . nevertheless , as clearly displayed in eqs .   and",
    ", the latter can be expanded in the basis spanned by the @xmath4 functions in terms of the usual dirac ( or weyl ) spinors for massless fermions in the absence of external fields .",
    "so far we have been considering only the noninteracting theory for massless fermions in a constant external magnetic field .",
    "once the interaction with the ( quantum ) photon field is taken into account , the fermion will receive radiative corrections , which in turn give rise to the self - energy .",

    "following the same steps that lead to eq .",

    "we shall now clarify this confusion .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that in the presence of a constant magnetic field the fermion self - energy operator @xmath89 is a dirac matrix - valued scalar function of the form @xmath90 , \\label{sigmaop}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the external field strength . in order to highlight the fact that the self - energy is in general an _ off - shell _ quantity ,",
    "we have used the term self - energy operator instead of the usual term mass operator , which can be misleading .",
    "a comment here is in order .",
    "based on symmetry arguments  @xcite , for constant external fields the self - energy operator @xmath89 in general depends on two extra operators : @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the former vanishes identically in the absence of an external electric field .",
    "the latter renders either the fermion self - energy or the position of the fermion pole ( i.e. , the fermion dispersion relation ) explicitly dependent on the sign of the external magnetic field strength , hence is forbidden by a residual @xmath96 symmetry of the rotational @xmath97 symmetry that is broken in the presence of an external magnetic field ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sd ] for a related discussion ) .",
    "since @xmath98 commutes with @xmath16 , the self - energy operator @xmath89 commutes with @xmath16 and hence is diagonal in the basis spanned by the eigenfunctions of @xmath16 .",
    "while this statement is correct in itself , it does not imply that @xmath89 is diagonal in the basis spanned by the @xmath4 functions .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "we note that even though @xmath89 commutes with @xmath16 , it does not commute with @xmath25 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 is _ not _ diagonal in the basis spanned by the @xmath4 functions , which are constructed in terms of the simultaneous eigenfunctions ( eigenvectors ) of the maximal set of mutually commuting operators @xmath99 .",
    "this is precisely the same reason why the operator @xmath74 , in spite of commuting with @xmath16 , is not diagonal in the basis spanned by the @xmath4 functions .",
    "last , but not least , we note that @xmath89 does _ not _ anticommute with @xmath18 .",
    "this in turn suggests , as one would already have expected , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the full theory of qed in the presence of a constant external magnetic field .",
    "while can be confirmed only by explicit nonperturbative calculation , the above symmetry arguments seem to indicate that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking should be a generic phenomenon independent of the number of fermion flavors .",
    "indeed , it is one of the goals of this article to verify in a gauge independent manner that in a constant external magnetic field chiral symmetry is dynamically broken regardless of the number of fermion flavors .",
    "the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations in massless qed in an external magnetic field are well - known in the literature ( for reviews see refs .",
    "the equations for the full fermion propagator @xmath100 are given by as in eq .  , it is implicitly assumed that the vacuum current vanishes . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : vc ] we show that the vacuum current does indeed vanish identically in a constant external magnetic field . ]",
    "@xmath101 where @xmath102 is the bare fermion propagator in the external gauge field @xmath10 given by eq .  , @xmath103 is the fermion self - energy and @xmath104 is the full vertex .",
    "the full photon propagator @xmath105 satisfies the equations @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the free photon propagator ( defined in covariant gauges ) and @xmath108 is the vacuum polarization .",
    "the diagrammatical representation of the sd equations - is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] .        since the dynamics of fermion pairing in a strong magnetic field",
    "is dominated by the lowest landau level ( lll )  @xcite , we will consider the propagation of , as well as radiative corrections originating only from , fermions occupying the lll .",
    "this is referred to as the lowest landau level approximation ( llla ) in the literature @xcite .",
    "therefore , except where otherwise explicitly stated , the fermion propagator and the fermion self - energy in the sd equations - as well as in the rest of this article will be taken to be those for the lll fermions .",
    "for notational simplicity , no separate notation will be introduced .",
    "it is well known that the sd equations - correspond to an infinite hierarchy of integral equations .",
    "this is because the full vertex ( i.e. , the three - point vertex function ) @xmath109 depends on four - point vertex functions which in turn depend on higher - point vertex functions , and so on . in order to reduce the sd equations to a closed system of integral equations that is tractable",
    ", a truncation scheme of the sd equations needs to be employed by truncating this infinite hierarchy at some point .",
    "diagrammatically , a truncation scheme of the sd equations corresponds to a resummation of a selected infinite subset of diagrams arising from every order in the loop expansion .",
    "the simplest truncation is done at the level of the three - point vertex function by expressing the full vertex @xmath109 in terms of the ( bare or full ) entities that already appeared in the sd equations .    to this end",
    "we will work in the bare vertex approximation ( bva ) , in which the vertex corrections are completely ignored .",

    "[ fig : sdbva ] .",
    "this truncation is also known as the ( improved ) rainbow approximation and has been employed extensively in the literature  @xcite .",

    "the dynamical fermion mass , obtained as the solution of the truncated sd equations evaluated on the fermion mass shell , is manifestly gauge independent . in the weak coupling regime",
    "that we consider , such a gauge independent approach allows one to resum consistently an infinite subset of diagrams that arise from every order in the loop expansion and whose contributions are of leading order in the gauge coupling , thus leading to a consistent and reliable calculation of the dynamical fermion mass .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof of the gauge independence of physical quantities is the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity satisfied by the vertex and the inverse fermion propagator .",
    "it is known  @xcite that in ordinary qed the bva is not a consistent truncation of the sd equations because the corresponding wt identity between the full fermion propagator and the bare vertex in general can not be fulfilled .",
    "the situation however changes drastically in the presence of a strong , constant external magnetic field as the motion of low - energy fermions is restricted in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field , leading to an effective dimensional reduction from @xmath111 to @xmath112 in the dynamics of fermion pairing in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the wt identity in the bva within the llla was first studied in ref .",
    "it was shown that in order to satisfy the wt identity in the bva within the llla , the lll fermion self - energy in momentum space has to be a momentum independent constant . however , due to a mistake in ref .",

    "as we will see below , calculation performed by using the correct orthonormal condition shows that the conclusion obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on the wt identity in the bva remains valid .",
    "the reliability of such a momentum independent approximation ( in that the fermion self - energy has very weak momentum dependence ) and , consequently , of the wt identity in the bva has been verified within the llla in a certain gauge in the momentum region relevant to the dynamics of fermion pairing in a strong magnetic field  @xcite ( see further discussions in sec .

    "this , together with the _ gauge dependent _ results obtained in the llla  @xcite regarding the reliability of a momentum independent fermion self - energy in the bva in the momentum region @xmath227 , indicates clearly that the gauge dependent contributions to the dynamical fermion mass arising from the momentum dependent terms in @xmath233 and @xmath234 are of order @xmath235 .",
    "hence physical quantities sensitive only to the kinematic region of momenta @xmath227 can be reliably calculated in the bva , and are gauge independent up to corrections of order @xmath236 .",
    "this in turn means that , consistent with the underlying assumption of the llla , the kinematic regime of low - energy photon exchange ( @xmath237 ) is precisely that which determines the dynamics of fermion pairing in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we are now in a position to establish direct contact between the sd equations truncated in the bva and the 2pi ( two - particle - irreducible ) effective action truncated at the lowest nontrivial order in the loop expansion as well as in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "since the 2pi effective action is constructed in terms of the full propagators and bare vertices , the corresponding wt identities usually can not be satisfied . in general , any truncation of the 2pi effective action is inevitably gauge dependent and hence , strictly speaking , an inconsistent one .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown recently in refs .",
    "@xcite that the truncated _ on - shell _ 2pi effective action has a controlled gauge dependence with the explicit gauge dependent terms always appearing at higher order .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation that the dynamical fermion mass obtained from the on - shell sd equations truncated in the bva with a momentum dependent fermion self - energy that violates the corresponding wt identity , is gauge independent up to corrections of higher order    in appendix  [ appendix:2pi ] we briefly summarize some exact relations derived from the 2pi effective action that are useful to our discussion here .",

    "[ fig:2pi ] , in which it is noted that the vertices that appear in @xmath241 $ ] as well as in the corresponding fermion self - energy and vacuum polarization are the _ bare _ ones . with the above observation one can conclude fairly easily that the 2pi effective action truncated at the lowest nontrivial order in the loop expansion or in the @xmath0 expansion resums identically the same infinite subset of diagrams as the sd equations truncated in the bva .",
    "the direct correspondence with the 2pi effective action truncated at the lowest nontrivial order has the following important consequences .",
    "on the one hand , the wt identity in the bva guarantees that the truncation at the lowest nontrivial order in the loop expansion or in the @xmath0 expansion with a momentum independent fermion self - energy is a consistent truncation of the 2pi effective action in the momentum region relevant to chiral symmetry breaking in a strong magnetic field . on the other hand , the facts that vertex corrections in the 2pi",
    "effective action start to appear at the next - to - lowest - nontrivial order in the loop expansion or in the @xmath0 expansion and that the truncated on - shell 2pi effective action ( in general with a momentum dependent fermion self - energy ) has a controlled gauge dependence with the explicit gauge dependent terms always appearing at higher order , provide an unequivocal justification of our argument that in a strong magnetic field the dynamical fermion mass to leading order in the gauge coupling or in the @xmath0 expansion can be reliably calculated in the bva , and is gauge independent up to corrections of higher order .",
    "whereas a direct verification by explicit calculation is indispensable , to the best of our knowledge consistent truncations of the sd equations that include vertex corrections either within or beyond the llla have not appeared in the literature .",
    "clearly such a task is beyond the scope of the current article , and will be the subject of further investigations .",
    "in this article we presented a critical and detailed study of chiral symmetry breaking in qed in a constant external magnetic field .",
    "the main goal is to determine in a gauge independent manner the dynamical fermion mass generated through chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we focused on the strong field limit as well as on the weak coupling regime .",
    "the former leads to a wide separation of energy scales such that the dynamics of fermion pairing is dominated by the lowest landau level .",
    "the latter allows for a controlled , nonperturbative calculation of the dynamical fermion mass , in the sense that there exists a systematic expansion in powers of the gauge coupling ( up to logarithms ) such that contributions of leading order in the gauge coupling that arise form every order in the loop expansion can be consistently accounted for , while subleading contributions are suppressed by powers of the gauge coupling ( up to logarithms ) .",
    "consequently , in the weak coupling regime a gauge independent , consistent truncation of the sd equations is tantamount to a good and reliable approximation .",
    "the wt identity in the bva is at the heart of our proof that the bva is a consistent truncation of the sd equations within the llla .",
    "we first verified that , with the corrected orthonormal condition of the @xmath4 functions for the lll fermions , the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that in order to satisfy the wt identity in the bva within the llla , the fermion self - energy has to be a momentum independent constant remains valid .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the wt identity in the bva can be satisfied only within the llla .",
    "the proof then proceeds with the assumption that the bva is a consistent truncation such that the position of the fermion pole obtained therein is gauge independent . with this assumption",
    ", the wt identity in the bva implies that the pole of the lll fermion propagator is located at @xmath156 , with @xmath154 being the momentum independent fermion self - energy _ as well as _ the physical , gauge independent dynamical fermion mass . the proof is completed by verifying that such an assumption does not lead to any inconsistency .",
    "this is achieved by showing that ( i ) the truncated vacuum polarization is transverse , ( ii ) the truncated fermion self - energy evaluated on the fermion mass shell is manifestly gauge independent . in particular",
    ", we showed that the would - be gauge dependent contribution to the truncated fermion self - energy that arises from the gauge dependent term in the full photon propagator vanishes identically on the fermion mass shell .",
    "this detailed study leads to a gauge independent , nonperturbative calculation of the dynamical fermion mass to leading order in the gauge coupling .",
    "furthermore , it allows one to identify unambiguously the infinite subset of diagrams that contribute to chiral symmetry breaking in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we made a detailed comparison between our results and those obtained in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the gauge independent analysis we presented in this article shows clearly that the results as well as the conclusions of those earlier studies are inevitably gauge dependent and can be attributed to inconsistent truncation schemes , gauge dependent artifacts , or both .",
    "nevertheless , based on the gauge dependent results  @xcite obtained within the llla regarding the reliability of a momentum independent fermion self - energy in the bva in the momentum region @xmath227 , we argued that in a strong magnetic field the dynamical fermion mass can be reliably calculated in the bva and is gauge independent up to corrections of higher order .",
    "this is consistent with the underlying assumption of the llla that the kinematic region of low - energy photon exchange ( @xmath237 ) is precisely that which determines the dynamics of fermion pairing in a strong magnetic field .",
    "motivated by the fact that the gauge dependence of the dynamical fermion mass calculated in the bva but with a momentum dependent fermion self - energy is subleading , we established a direct contact between the sd equations truncated in the bva and the 2pi effective action truncated at the lowest nontrivial order in the loop expansion as well as in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "this direct correspondence , together with the facts that vertex corrections in the 2pi effective action start to appear at the next - to - lowest - nontrivial order in the loop expansion or in the @xmath0 expansion and that the truncated on - shell 2pi effective action has a controlled gauge dependence with the explicit gauge dependent terms always appearing at higher order , provides the justification of our argument that in a strong magnetic field the dynamical fermion mass can be reliably calculated in the bva to leading order in the gauge coupling or in the @xmath0 expansion .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presence of a strong , constant external magnetic field provides a consistent truncation of the schwinger - dyson equations in terms of the bare vertex approximation within the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "this allows us to study in a gauge independent manner the physics of chiral symmetry breaking in qed in an external magnetic field and to obtain a solution for the physical dynamical fermion mass .",
    "the gauge independent approach to the schwinger - dyson equations in gauge theories that we presented in this article is quite general in nature , and hence not specific to the problem of chiral symmetry breaking in a strong magnetic field discussed here .",
    "we believe this approach will be useful in other areas of physics that also require a nonperturbative understanding of gauge theories , such as the studies of hadronic structure and the connection between quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in nuclear and particle physics  @xcite , the physics of superconductivity and superfluidity in condensed matter systems  @xcite , as well as the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of hot and dense matter  @xcite .",
