    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been postulated to resolve the conflict between dynamical estimates of galaxy and galaxy cluster masses , and estimates of their luminous or baryon mass .",
    "dm , as a source of gravitational potential , is an essential ingredient in the current @xmath4cdm concordance cosmology of the universe as derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite and high redshift supernova searches @xcite .",
    "little consensus exists , however , on its properties at smaller galactic scales with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) currently being at odds . indeed , the lack of a consistent understanding of dm has led some to question the necessity of the dm postulate @xcite .",
    "an important diagnostic in the study of dm is its distribution throughout a galaxy .",
    "the strongest constraints come from observations of spiral galaxies , where neutral hydrogen gas can be used to detect the influence of dm beyond the stellar disk @xcite .",
    "the case for dm in the more massive elliptical galaxies is less concrete .",
    "unlike the simpler geometry of disk galaxies , the intrinsic three - dimensional shape of an elliptical can not be uniquely determined from its projected shape .",
    "similarly , the orbital structure of ellipticals is dominated by random motion , whereas the stars and gas in spiral galaxies move on nearly circular orbits .",
    "these fundamental limitations are exacerbated by practical ones . because the galaxy surface brightness drops steeply as a function of radius , measurements of the stellar kinematics in ellipticals",
    "do not extend far into the galaxy halo , and require substantial observational effort .",
    "furthermore , their gas content is low , and surveys of tracer populations such as globular clusters and planetary nebulae have until recently generated only modestly sized samples , the one exception being cen  a @xcite .",
    "the picture is only discouraging in contrast to the observations of disk galaxies , however , and  taken in their own right  the recent data on elliptical galaxies have greatly improved the understanding of these systems .",
    "measurements of the stellar kinematics in ellipticals now include higher order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) as a matter of course ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "knowledge of the actual losvd , as opposed to only the first and second moments , can lift the degeneracy between the mass distribution and the velocity structure @xcite . along with",
    "more sophisticated modeling techniques , the observations , sometimes going out as far as two effective ( half - light ) radii @xmath5 , have allowed for a better constrained dynamical picture of a growing number of ellipticals ( for references , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "most intriguingly , the circular velocity curves in the @xcite sample are quite flat , indicative of the presence of a dm halo . despite this",
    ", no clear trends have emerged about the dm distribution in ellipticals , with some galaxies showing evidence for dm within @xmath6 ( mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath1 band @xmath7 ) , and others showing little or no evidence @xcite .",
    "gas is scarce in early - type galaxies , but not rare .",
    "polar ring galaxies , a rare breed of s0s with a ring of neutral hydrogen perpendicular to the galaxy s symmetry plane , have been used to constrain the mass and shape of dm halos , but much depends on the assumption of self - gravity of the ring @xcite .",
    "the most consistent evidence for a dm halo around ellipticals comes from studies of their hot gas , which radiates in the x - ray around 1  kev . using a sample of giant ( @xmath8 )",
    ", ellipticals @xcite conclude that dm does not dominate within an effective radius , but that the dm fraction within @xmath9 is in the range of 39 - 85% . because early type galaxies with @xmath10 have faint x - ray spectra which tend to be dominated by the contribution from the stellar component , e.g. x - ray binaries , this finding can not be extended to fainter ellipticals .",
    "imaging by x - ray satellites _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , which shows bubbles and other structures , has complicated the picture presented by @xcite , which assumes  as is typical  sphericity and ( isothermal ) hydrostatic equilibrium . for a recent review of the topic of hot gas in ellipticals ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing of light by elliptical galaxies is an additional probe of dm halos , especially at large radii .",
    "@xcite have used the distortion ( shear ) of faint background galaxies by a foreground galaxy to measure the mass - to - light ratio of early - type galaxies . adding the shear signal from many hundreds of early type lens galaxies in their fields they derive @xmath11 within @xmath12 .",
    "strong lensing , where the lens galaxy produces multiple  typically two or four  images of a background source , yields more specific information , but the sample of lens systems is limited @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite deduces that dm can not account for more than 33% of the mass within one @xmath14 , or 40% within @xmath6 , consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "finally , globular clusters ( gcs ) , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , and satellite galaxies provide discrete tracers of a galaxy s kinematics and , with suitable assumptions , of the dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gcs are not as numerous as pne , and the additional difficulty of absorption line spectroscopy on faint objects has limited the use of gcs as kinematic tracers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis is further complicated by the fact that gcs do not generally trace the light distribution of their host galaxy . in this paper",
    "we focus on the planetary nebulae ( pne ) that can be used to investigate the dynamics of early - type galaxies .",
    "this approach stretches back to @xcite and their study of m32 .",
    "pne are part of the brief phase in the life of an intermediate mass ( 0.88  @xmath15 ) star when it evolves from a red giant to a white dwarf ; this makes pne a good tracer of old stellar populations ( but see @xcite for a discussion on `` young '' pne ) . during this transition",
    "the star ejects most of its mass , leaving a hot stellar remnant which rapidly ( @xmath16 years ) cools to a white dwarf .",
    "the pn proper is an expanding shell of dense gas being photo - ionized by the central stellar remnant .",
    "pne are bright objects , emitting on the order of a few hundred @xmath17 in a few emission lines , most notably [ ] @xmath18 ( up to 15% of the total luminosity ; * ? ? ?",
    "this not only enables us to detect them at extragalactic distances ( out to 1015  mpc on 4-m class telescopes ) , but also to measure their velocity along the line of sight .",
    "we have collected pne samples for a set of early - type galaxies with the rutgers fabry - prot ( rfp ) , which can be thought of as a narrow band ( @xmath19 ) filter with a tunable central wavelength .",
    "scanning around the ( redshifted ) [ ] @xmath18 emission line , the rfp generates a three - dimensional data cube where the galaxy background has been strongly reduced and monochromatic point sources , such as pne , stand out against the background .",
    "detection and measurement of the radial velocity are all achieved in one observing run .",
    "other techniques that look for extragalactic pne include the planetary nebula spectrograph @xcite , an instrument using slitless spectroscopy , and on / off band photometry in conjunction with multi - object spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : ",
    "[ s : observations ] summarizes the observing strategy and conditions ;  [ s : reduction ] and  [ s : calibration ] discuss the data reduction and calibration ;  [ s : extraction ] to  [ s : compcont ] show the process of our pn candidate selection , including accounting for completeness and interlopers ; and we present the samples in full in  [ s : results ] . considering the recent interest in ngc  3379 @xcite we present our mass models for this galaxy in ",
    "[ s : massmodels ] .",
    "a summary of our findings is given in ",
    "[ s : wrapup ] .",
    "we observed the four galaxies in our sample with the rfp over the course of two runs at the ctio 4  m blanco telescope ( f/8 cassegrain focus ) .",
    "details of the setup are given in table  [ t : setup ] .",
    "the rfp has a circular field of view with a diameter of @xmath20 , and a spectral response function that is well approximated by a voigt profile with a @xmath21   , equivalent to @xmath22 at 5000   .",
    "there is a wavelength gradient between the center and the edge of an image of 4.6   .",
    "we typically scanned a wavelength span of 25    around the appropriately redshifted 5007    [ ] emission line in steps of approximately 1   .",
    "at this wavelength the free spectral range of the rfp is 48    and we used one of two blocking filters with a fwhm of 44    to ensure that only one order was transmitted .",
    "we used tek @xmath23 pixel ccds , with @xmath24 pixels ( binned to @xmath25 on the 1994 run ) , but only read out the portion of the ccd illuminated by the rfp .    at the start of each run we observed a set of emission lines around 5000    using a calibration lamp",
    "the resulting `` ring '' images allowed us to establish the relationship between the gap setting @xmath26 and the transmitted wavelength @xmath27 at the center of the image ; to determine the free spectral range of the etalon ; and to measure the shape of the spectral response function . to monitor changes in the wavelength calibration we took further images of the lamp throughout each night .",
    "we discuss the wavelength calibration in more detail in ",
    "[ s : wlcal ] .",
    "for each run we obtained one series of dome flats at settings spaced @xmath28 apart .",
    "twilight flats are not advisable , because of the spectral structure of the sky at the resolution of the rfp .",
    "additionally we observed spectrophotometric standard stars on each run : six 90  s exposures of ltt  3218 in 1994 and six 300  s exposures of ltt  2415 in 1995 @xcite .",
    "the leo galaxies , ngc  3379 and ngc  3384 , were observed with multiple pointings , typically one pointing per night .",
    "ngc  1549 and ngc  4636 , on the other hand , had only one pointing each , but were observed throughout the course of a run to get the full wavelength coverage .",
    "ngc  1549 was observed at the start of each night , ngc  4636 towards the end .",
    "the exposure time for each image was 900  s. to avoid systematic effects in the photometry consecutive exposures were not sequential in wavelength and were dithered by a few pixels .",
    "the appropriate blocking filter was determined by the central wavelength in an exposure being smaller or larger than the switching wavelength @xmath29 ( see table  [ t : setup ] ) .",
    "exposures were repeated if the seeing or the photometric conditions were particularly poor .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  [ t : fields ] .",
    "the seeing was poor during both runs : @xmath30 in 1995 and in the range 1.72.2  in 1994 .",
    "the latter is partly due to difficulties in focusing the telescope and problems with the auto - guider .",
    "conditions were mostly photometric in 1994 , with the exception of the last half of the first night , which only affected the observations of ngc  4636 . for the 1995 run we were less fortunate .",
    "the first two nights are fully photometric , but not the two following nights . as a result",
    "only half of our fields was observed completely under photometric conditions . as we will show below",
    ", this affected the quality of our pn photometry , but not of our radial velocity measurements .",
    "we used iraf for most of our data reduction .",
    "each image was overscan corrected , trimmed and bias subtracted . since the dark current contribution was negligible for the length of our exposures , no dark frames were taken .",
    "each image was flatfielded using the flatfield image with a central wavelength closest to that of the image .    to aid the cosmic ray removal process and the photometry ( see  [",
    "s : flcal ] ) we aligned the images for each pointing ( a `` stack '' ) using the few stars that were visible in each field ( see table  [ t : fields ] ) . in all cases a simple shift over a few pixels proved to be adequate . since the psf was well resolved , we shifted the images by integer pixels to avoid interpolation effects .",
    "cosmic rays were tagged , not removed , by combining all the images in a stack using the iraf task ` imcombine ` with the ` crreject ` rejection algorithm , creating a mask for each image which covered the comic ray events . to be conservative",
    "we added a rim of masked pixels around each event .",
    "the padded masks covered on average 8% of the field of view .",
    "the final step in preparing the images in a stack was the removal of the background light . in our case",
    "the background is mainly light from the galaxy and its ghost , with the sky contributing an almost negligible amount .",
    "ghosts are the result of the reflections between the ccd and the etalon , which create a faint in - focus replica of the original object , mirror reflected about the optical axis .",
    "we removed the background to reduce gradients which would bias the photometry , allowing us to detect pne closer to the galaxy .",
    "we wrote a fortran program which estimated the background with a ring filter @xcite , where we replaced the median with a more robust estimator of the mean @xcite .",
    "a ring filter removes objects at scales smaller than the diameter of the ring and we chose our diameter to be about twice the seeing radius .",
    "the shifted , masked and background subtracted stacks formed the basis for our further analysis .",
    "the calibration of the rfp stacks consists of three parts : ( i ) image registration , i.e. assigning celestial coordinates to each pixel position ; ( ii ) spectral calibration ; ( iii ) flux normalization , i.e. accounting for variations in the observing conditions .      in each field",
    "we had only a few stars to register the images ( see table  [ t : fields ] ) .",
    "these astrometric reference stars generally did not have published positions , because of their proximity to the galaxy being observed , and we had to determine their coordinates from observations with a larger field of view . for ngc  3379 and ngc  3384",
    "we had deep broad band ( @xmath31-like ) images with @xmath32 pixels ; for ngc  1549 and ngc  4636 we used images from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) with @xmath33 pixels . using the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite we were able to identify 80 or more stars in each of these images and consequently measured the celestial coordinates of the rfp reference stars .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in a single rfp coordinate , as estimated from the variance in the reference star positions , is @xmath34 for ngc  1549 and ngc  4636 , compared to about @xmath35 for the other two galaxies . in the case of the leo  i galaxies ( ngc  3379 and ngc  3384 ) we noticed a systematic @xmath36 offset between the @xcite coordinates and our own when we compared our pne sample with their lists ( see  [ s : samp3379 ] ) .",
    "we found that the offset can be attributed completely to the difference in astrometric reference star coordinates .",
    "since our project does not require absolute astrometry we did not investigate the matter further .",
    "the transmitted wavelength @xmath37 at a position @xmath38 on an rfp image taken at a gap setting @xmath26 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are parameters relating @xmath26 to the central wavelength of an rfp image , @xmath42 is the position of the optical axis of the rfp and @xmath43 is the focal length of the camera lens of the rfp . to calibrate this relation",
    "we observe several emission lines from a calibration lamp at a range of @xmath26 settings at the beginning of a run . during a run",
    "we take additional calibration images ( `` night rings '' ) , eight to ten per night , to ensure the stability of our calibration . over",
    "the course of our runs @xmath41 and @xmath43 were stable , consistent with our experience from other runs .",
    "the value for @xmath42 , however , fluctuates as a result of flexure in the spectrograph ; likewise , the wavelength zero - point @xmath40 shifts due to drift in the control electronics .",
    "the overall drift in @xmath40 was a little larger than 1    over a run ; the overall shift in @xmath42 never larger than 6  pixels during a night .",
    "we interpolated the values for @xmath40 and @xmath42 for each image from the values obtained from the night rings .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath37 due to the calibration is 0.05    ( @xmath44 at 5007   ) , based on the scatter in our calibration fits with the dominant source of uncertainty being @xmath43 .",
    "the initial calibration run also allows us to calibrate the spectral response function ( srf ) of the rfp , i.e. the line shape of a monochromatic source .",
    "although for a perfect etalon the srf is an airy function , experience shows that the srf is better fitted by a voigt function , the convolution of a gaussian with a lorentzian @xcite .",
    "the shape is determined by two parameters : the gaussian width @xmath45 and the lorentzian width @xmath46 ( see table  [ t : setup ] ) .",
    "note that the shape parameters are significantly different between the two runs , but that the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the profile is practically the same at @xmath47   .",
    "we intentionally did not want to resolve the intrinsic structure of the pn line profile ( see section  [ s : modspectra ] ) , since it would reduce the depth of our survey and would complicate our study unnecessarily .",
    "in each field of view we use a reference object to provide us with a fiducial flux for every image in a stack , to calibrate the extinction due to light cirrus .",
    "considering the narrow wavelength range we are observing it is reasonable to assume a flat spectrum for each reference object .",
    "we can then calculate normalization factors for each image in a straightforward manner .",
    "only the spectrum of the reference star in the west field of ngc  3379 showed an indication of absorption lines .",
    "for ngc  3379 we therefore decided to use the galaxy flux within a @xmath48 aperture as a reference source .",
    "the galaxy spectrum has a slight curvature at the blue edge , which we modeled with a smoothing spline .",
    "the uncertainty in each normalization factor is 3 - 5% .",
    "we were unable to get an independent determination of the atmospheric extinction during our runs , because we observed our spectrophotometric standard stars only once a night and all at approximately the same airmass .",
    "instead , we adopted a value for the extinction of 0.19  magnitude per airmass as given for ctio @xcite ; on photometric nights the flux normalization factors were found to be consistent with assumed extinction . finally , using the spectrophotometry for the standard stars , we converted our instrumental fluxes to physical units .",
    "comparison with previously published pn magnitudes shows no systematic effects ( see below ) .",
    "we extract spectra for every independent point in the field of view of a stack and for each spectrum decide whether or not an emission line is present . a more targeted approach , where we would look for emission line point sources in each image of a stack using , for instance , daophot @xcite , requires extensive fine tuning due to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the objects and still produces numerous spurious detections .",
    "( @xcite used this approach to look for pne around ngc  3384 . ) our method is not computationally expensive and has no bias due to a search algorithm .",
    "the fluxes for each spectrum were extracted using the ` apphot ` aperture photometry package in iraf .",
    "we performed a set of monte carlo simulations of our instrumental setup ( see table  [ t : setup ] ) to compare the results of psf and aperture photometry .",
    "psf photometry , assuming perfect knowledge of the psf , produced an appreciably larger scatter in the derived fluxes than aperture photometry did . because we have only one star in each field bright enough to determine a psf",
    ", there was the additional concern of the effects of a psf mismatch .",
    "both considerations lead us to use aperture photometry .",
    "each field of view was sampled on a triangular grid , the most isotropic choice .",
    "the spacing between sample points was chosen to nyquist sample the image , i.e. sample points are separated by half the smallest seeing fwhm in a stack , to guarantee no information was lost . following @xcite we chose our aperture radius to be slightly larger than two thirds of the seeing fwhm in",
    "order optimize the signal to noise ratio within the aperture . in this case",
    "the photometry apertures overlap slightly more than 50% in area . if the aperture contained masked pixels , e.g. a cosmic ray , the data point was removed from the spectrum . in cases where we measured a negative flux , we estimated the uncertainty from the uncertainties in the positive fluxes near the continuum level .",
    "no aperture corrections are needed , since we photometer a pn candidate and a reference star in the same way .    the final data product , then",
    ", is a set of @xmath49 spectra where each spectrum is a list of the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 the number of images in a stack , @xmath52 the wavelength , @xmath53 the flux , @xmath54 the uncertainty in the flux and @xmath55 a possible photometric error flag . in the following section",
    "we discuss how we determine which spectra indicate the presence of an emission line .",
    "to establish the presence of a pn candidate in a spectrum we fit a flat continuum model and an emission line model to each spectrum , measuring the difference in the goodness - of - fit using a statistic @xmath56 .",
    "after calibrating the distribution of @xmath56 with monte carlo simulations we choose a significance level @xmath57 and select all spectra with a value @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we visually inspect each stack at the candidate positions to verify the selection and avoid contamination from crs and image artifacts .",
    "the details of the procedure are described below .",
    "we expect most extracted spectra to have a flat , practically zero , flux distribution , since we removed the background in each image . in addition a flat model spectrum should encompass the spectra from foreground stars in our field . hence , our null hypothesis is a simple constant flux model . modeling spectra with a linear function @xmath59 yielded no significant improvements over the constant model , because of the flux uncertainties .",
    "the alternative hypothesis is that a spectrum contains an emission line .",
    "such a model needs to take into account the intrinsic structure of the [ ] line , since pne , as observed in our own galaxy , often have doubly peaked emission lines @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic width of each of these peaks is small ( @xmath60 ) , and the nebular expansion velocity @xmath61 , defined as half the separation between the two peaks , has a distribution with a mode around @xmath62 , but a mean of @xmath63 due to the large tail at higher velocities @xcite . based on the latter",
    "we calculate that the broadening of our _ observed _ line profile ( see below ) due to line structure is @xmath64 , negligible considering the wavelength sampling of our spectra ( see table  [ t : setup ] ) .",
    "we will assume from now on that pne can be treated monochromatic point sources .",
    "consequently , the line profile is determined by the effective filter transmission @xmath65 and the rfp spectral response @xmath66 .",
    "we separate the two because they are measured separately from each other .",
    "the measurement of the latter is described in section  [ s : wlcal ] ; for the former we use the filter curves provided by ctio .",
    "we assumed that temperature effects on @xmath65 are unimportant .",
    "the f/7.5 beam used for our observations is slow enough to have a negligible effect on the transmission properties of our filters @xcite .    the effective filter transmission @xmath65 changes the line shape from a simple voigt profile in two ways .",
    "the first modification is a discontinuous jump in the emission line profile , which is the result of changing from the `` blue '' filter @xmath67 to `` red '' filter @xmath68 whenever the central wavelength of an image is larger than the switching wavelength @xmath29 .",
    "the total flux of a pn observed at @xmath69 will differ between the two filters , since in general @xmath70 .",
    "hence , a spectrum will show a jump at @xmath71 .",
    "the jump is appreciable when @xmath69 close to @xmath71 , but is otherwise negligible .",
    "the second modification stems from the fact that the flatfield images are based on exposures of continuum sources .",
    "a flatfield image taken on the red edge of a filter includes light from the neighboring order of the rfp on the blue edge . as a result",
    "we overestimate the sensitivity of the detector when applying the flatfield to an emission line object , which has flux in one order only .",
    "ignoring this effect would lead to a wavelength dependent bias in the measured total flux of a pn .",
    "we can adjust for this effect by calculating a correction factor @xmath72 , the integral over the filter transmittance and the srf .",
    "figure  [ f : profiles ] illustrates how the two effects modify the line profile .    to account for the above two effects",
    "we characterize the spectrum of a pn candidate extracted from a stack of @xmath51 images in the following way : @xmath73 where @xmath49 is the flatfielded and normalized flux measured at position @xmath74 and rfp setting @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the total flux received from the pn candidate , @xmath66 is the srf , @xmath77 is the appropriate filter transmission , and @xmath78 is the continuum level . since the spectra we extract from the rfp stacks are critically sampled , we can not constrain the shape of the line profile in addition to fitting a peak wavelength , total intensity and background flux .",
    "hence , we fixed @xmath45 and @xmath46 to the values determined from the calibration run in our further data analysis .",
    "the factor @xmath79 corrects for the luminosity bias ; it depends implicitly on @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath78 can potentially give us a handle on the contamination of our sample ( see section  [ s : cont ] ) .",
    "we fit the two models to each spectrum by minimizing a goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath80 defined by @xmath81 ^ 2 \\over \\sigma_{f_i}^2 } .\\ ] ] we set @xmath82 for the continuum model and @xmath83 for the emission line model .",
    "the minimum @xmath84 value was found using the e04unf routine from the nag numerical library , which is designed to solve nonlinear least - squares programming problems in the presence of constraints on the parameters . since the uncertainties in our data points",
    "are not gaussian , the uncertainties in our best fit parameter values do not necessarily correspond to a @xmath85 error .",
    "we used simulated observations ( see section  [ s : finsel ] ) to verify the plausibility of uncertainties found in the fitting procedure .",
    "the continuum model @xmath86 and the emission line model @xmath87 are nested models , i.e. the parameters in @xmath86 form a subset of the parameters in @xmath87 ( the additional parameters of @xmath87 are fixed to some default value ) .",
    "the likelihood - ratio ( lr ) test or the @xmath88-test are conventionally used to decide between the null hypothesis @xmath86 and the alternative hypothesis @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "each of these tests uses a test statistic @xmath56 which is some simple function of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the best fit values of @xmath84 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively . under certain regularity conditions these test statistics have analytically known reference distributions ( e.g. @xcite ) , usually in the limit of large @xmath51 , which allow a level of significance to be determined for the observed value of @xmath56 .    in our case two of the regularity conditions",
    "are not met .",
    "first , the tests assume that the data are independent , identically distributed random variables . as a result of the flatfielding",
    "the data points in our spectra are not identically distributed .",
    "second , the default values for the additional parameters in @xmath87 can not be on the boundary of parameter space .",
    "the null hypothesis assumes that @xmath82 , clearly on the boundary of our parameter space .",
    "this is not an academic point : @xcite show that when this condition is violated the actual reference distribution is markedly different from the nominal reference distribution ( see their figure  3 ) .",
    "the problem of including boundary values in a parameter space has no standard analytical solution . @xcite",
    "present a more comprehensive introduction .",
    "we decided to use the lr test statistic @xmath91 , but to calibrate its reference distribution by way of monte carlo simulations instead of using the nominal reference distribution . ( the choice of the lr test over the @xmath88-test is motivated in the next section . )",
    "the reference distribution @xmath92 specifies the probability that the test statistic has an observed value @xmath56 under the condition that the null hypothesis is true . to calibrate @xmath93",
    "we simulated stacks of images that contain no emission line objects , preserve the noise characteristics of the original observations , and are reduced in the same way as the original observations .",
    "every field of view was calibrated separately .    as an example",
    ", we show the result of these simulations for the east field of ngc  3379 in figure  [ f : falsepos_hist ] .",
    "the nominal reference distribution of @xmath56 in our case is a @xmath94 distribution @xcite . in this particular case",
    "the actual reference distribution can be approximated by a @xmath95 distribution , as shown by the best - fitting @xmath96 curve , but this is not generally true .",
    "a proper calibration of the test statistic is clearly essential in order to avoid a plethora of false positives . for each field of view",
    "we choose the value of @xmath97 that corresponds to a significance level @xmath98 and select all spectra with @xmath99 .",
    "our experience shows that at this significance level we can observe a pn candidate in at least two frames .      since the photometric apertures overlap , pne candidates in each field of view tend to cluster in contiguous groups of 3 - 6 spectra sharing a similar central wavelength @xmath69 . instead of developing an algorithm to make a final selection of candidates from these clusters , we performed the final selection by hand .",
    "first we remove any obviously false identifications due to crs and image artifacts , e.g. the ghost image of a bright star .",
    "next we choose the brightest spectrum in a cluster as the candidate spectrum and visually inspect its position in every image of the stack .",
    "once we are convinced we have a bona fide pne candidate , we determine the exact position of the candidate and redo the photometry of the candidate to provide the final parameters for the object .",
    "we have two estimates for the uncertainties in @xmath76 , @xmath69 , and @xmath78 : the variances from the formal best - fit covariance matrix @xcite , and the empirical estimates from the artificial pne simulations ( see section  [ s : compcont ] ) . for pn candidates with @xmath99 we found that the best - fit parameters are only slightly correlated and that the two uncertainty estimates are consistent with each other .",
    "hence , we used the best - fit variances as our measure of the uncertainties in the magnitude and line - of - sight velocity .",
    "we note that @xmath69 is in our experience significantly better constrained than @xmath76 ; the continuum level @xmath78 is always consistent with zero , as expected .",
    "the false - negative simulations also allow us to estimate the random uncertainty in a pn position at @xmath100 , which does not include the systematic uncertainty discussed in section  [ s : imgreg ] .    in the same way that one can determine an aperture radius that optimizes the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath101 within some photometric aperture @xcite , we determine a wavelength window centered on the peak wavelength which optimizes @xmath101 in the spectral domain .",
    "numerical experiments show that a window width of 4/3 the spectral fwhm is optimal . to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio we simply added the signal from all frames within 1.4    of @xmath69 and divided this by the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties ( all quantities were converted to photons ) . taking into account the seeing , the background flux , the sampling and the photometric conditions of our observations",
    ", we find that our empirical values are in agreement with the theoretical expression of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  6 ) .",
    "to characterize our pn samples fully we need to address two issues : completeness and contamination .",
    "the former describes the probability that our experiment , i.e. the whole of observations , data reduction and analysis , would not detect a pn with a flux @xmath76 .",
    "the latter specifies the extent to which candidates in our samples are not actually pne . in the context of our experiment",
    "the completeness is closely related to the ( statistical ) power of the test statistic and we show that the lrt is preferred over the @xmath88-test because it gives us a more complete sample .",
    "it is more difficult to quantify the contamination , mainly because the distribution of possible contaminating sources is still poorly understood .",
    "based on our estimates , discussed in more detail below , contamination is not a serious concern in our samples .      for statisticians",
    "the usefulness or _ power _ of a test lies in its ability to reject the null hypothesis ( @xmath102 ) when in fact the alternative hypothesis ( @xmath103 is true .",
    "and @xmath78 are parameters of little interest ( `` nuisance parameters '' ) and we marginalize the distribution of @xmath56 over these two parameters . ]",
    "the power function @xmath104 is quantified by @xmath105 i.e. the probability that , given a level of significance @xmath57 , we reject the true ( alternative ) hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the actual form of @xmath104 is contingent upon our choice of @xmath57 , but is generally monotonically increasing .",
    "when multiple tests are available , statisticians look for the test with a minimum @xmath104 , the one least likely to lead to an invalid conclusion .    astronomers , on the other hand , think in terms of completeness : we want to maximize our ability to identify objects of a given type . since our experiments are limited by observing conditions ( exposure time , seeing , etc . )",
    "we rarely obtain a complete sample , instead quantifying the level of completeness in terms of a limiting magnitude .",
    "typically , the depth of a survey is defined by the flux level where the probability of detecting an object is 50% : @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "hence , the more powerful test is the test where @xmath107 is the smallest and so allows the survey to go deepest .",
    "we considered two statistics commonly used in model comparisons : the lr statistic @xmath108 and the @xmath88-statistic @xmath109 where @xmath51 is the number of data points in a spectrum , @xmath110 the number of parameters in @xmath87 , and @xmath111 the difference in the number of parameters between @xmath86 and @xmath87 . a third statistic that is sometimes used ,",
    "the goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath112 , was not considered , since it does not take into account an alternative hypothesis and consequently is not a powerful test .",
    "although @xmath113 and @xmath114 yield about the same significance for a spectral feature @xcite , the lr test is generally more powerful than the @xmath88-test , the latter being the more appropriate test when the uncertainties in the data are unknown @xcite .    in order to ascertain the limiting magnitude of our observations we simulated stacks with artificial pne and analyzed them as we would real observations",
    ". by comparing the analyses using @xmath113 and @xmath114 we found that the former is the more powerful of the two tests , as expected .",
    "an illustration of this point is given in figure  [ f:3379maglim ] : in the case of our ngc  3379 observations @xmath113 allows us to go @xmath115  mag deeper than @xmath114 .",
    "the limiting magnitudes for each field of view are shown in table  [ t : fields ] .",
    "each pn detection is based on the assumption that the detected emission line is the [ ] 5007 line .",
    "a simple way to check if a candidate is actually a pn , short of taking a complete spectrum , is to measure the flux in the [ ] @xmath116 emission line , since the line ratio @xmath117 is fixed @xcite .",
    "our wavelength range , however , does not include the redshifted @xmath116 line , and we have to rely on statistics to appraise the possibility of an interloper in our pn samples .",
    "the search for high - redshift emission line galaxies in order to determine their star - formation history @xcite , as well as searches targeted to quantify the contamination of intracluster pn surveys @xcite have improved our understanding of possible contaminants .",
    "the most likely candidates that  to our knowledge  could contaminate our samples are @xmath118 sources at @xmath119 , and [ ] @xmath120 at @xmath121 @xcite . in the absence of any other information , the most likely interloper is a @xmath118 source , since these tend to have significantly stronger lines than the [ ] sources @xcite . in particular , at the depth of our observations ( @xmath122 or @xmath123 ) the probability of the latter contaminating our samples is negligible . for the former @xcite determine a surface density of @xmath124 per unit redshift for @xmath118 with @xmath125 , consistent with the determination of @xcite for the leo group of galaxies .",
    "taking into account the redshift range ( @xmath126 ) and the effective area ( 5.816.2  @xmath127 ) of our surveys , we expect well fewer than one contaminating source in any of our samples .",

    "in many cases , however , the @xmath128 line will be broad enough to be resolved by the rfp and have an asymmetric profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such sources are unlikely to be selected in our detection procedure and would be recognizable from their spectra .",
    "additionally , these @xmath128 sources often have a faint continuum which can be used to identify an interloper , which partly motivated our inclusion of a continuum term in equation  [ e : emmodel ] .",
    "all our candidate spectra show continuum levels fully consistent with a zero background . on the basis of these considerations",
    "we believe that the possibility of contamination by @xmath128 sources in our samples can be ignored .",

    "additionally , the seeing of these observations was large ( @xmath129 ) and the first night we had non - photometric conditions . because of the lower surface brightness we were able to go deep enough to discover two pne in this system , whose velocities are consistent with the systemic velocity @xcite .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure  [ f : n1549spectra].1 and the properties of the pne in table  [ t:1549-pne ] .",
    "the e1 galaxy ngc  1549 is in close interaction with its neighbor ngc  1553 as is evidenced by the strong isophote twisting @xcite and the faint shells surrounding it @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is the most distant in our sample and has not been targeted for a pn survey before .",
    "photometric conditions varied throughout the five nights of observation , but this was mitigated by the relatively good seeing and the small airmass of the observations , which allowed us to go a little deeper than for the leo  galaxies .",

    "although @xcite have argued , purely on the basis of photometry , for a reclassification from e1 to s0 . because of its proximity ngc  3379 is an ideal candidate to look for extragalactic pne and we observed it with two pointings , giving an effective survey area of @xmath135 , which excludes the bright central ( @xmath136 ) part of the galaxy .",
    "the frames for each pointing were taken over two nights ; each pointing had one night of non - photometric quality .",

    "we can observe 57 of the @xcite candidates , and we recovered 30 of these .",
    "similarly , we can measure 15 velocities from @xcite and we recover 7 of these .",
    "the overlap with the previous work gives us an independent check on our calibration : comparisons of the pn magnitudes and line - of - sight velocities are shown in figures  [ f : n3379magcomp ] and  [ f : n3379velcomp ] .",
    "the magnitudes are consistent within their uncertainties , although there is clearly crowding near the limiting magnitudes of either survey .",
    "considering that 50% of our data was taken under non - photometric conditions , the agreement is remarkable .",
    "the additional tight agreement between the two velocity measurements further convinces us that we calibrated our data properly and adequately .",
    "in our sample of pne we have one candidate with an unusual velocity : e27 at @xmath139 .",
    "it is unlikely to be associated with ngc  3384 , because of the latter s velocity field , which would favor pne with velocities over @xmath140 .",
    "hence , it could either be an interloper or an intragroup pn , but we have no way of ascertaining either conjecture . in the mass models we present for ngc  3379 , we exclude this object in our data analysis .    the overall pattern of radial velocities ( see fig .  [",

    "ngc  3384 was observed with four pointings , giving an effective survey area of @xmath149 , which excludes the bright inner part of the galaxy , ghosts , and the brightest reference stars . because the rfp produces ghost images of bright objects the survey area has a complicated topology",

    "we can apply the tme to the ngc  3384 data , but we need to make some additional assumptions , since figure  [ f : rvfields ] shows the clear disk - like kinematics of the pn sample .",
    "we will assume that the s0 has a flat rotation curve at @xmath150 and that all pne lie in the plane of the disk with a power law density distribution .",
    "the disk has a presumed inclination @xmath151 ; hence we can split the line - of - sight velocities of the pne into a component due to the rotation and a random component .",

    "only the two leo galaxies , ngc  3379 and ngc  3384 , have pn sample sizes that are large enough to give potentially interesting results . in the following we consider spherical mass models for the e1 galaxy ngc  3379 ; attempts to build axisymmetric mass models for the s0 galaxy ngc  3384 were not successful and",

    "having specified the projection of our model into observable space , we calculate the posterior probability @xmath176 for a given trial model @xmath185 from the likelihood and the prior probability .",
    "we define the likelihood as follows @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the observed velocity dispersions from the long slit spectra and their uncertainties , and @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the radial velocities of the pne and their uncertainties .",

    "the high dimensionality of our model space ( @xmath195 ) precludes sampling the posterior @xmath176 using a simple grid .",
    "instead we explore the model space using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method .",
    "a mcmc is no more than a random walk which , given enough steps , yields a set of trial models whose density distribution in the model space is proportional to the posterior distribution .",
    "the main difficulty in using mcmcs is to ensure that the random walk has wandered enough through model space for the density of trial models to have converged to the posterior distribution . to improve the convergence of our mcmcs we use the slice sampler @xcite to generate the random walk instead of the more conventional metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "lacking a consensus among statisticians about the correct way to establish the convergence of an mcmc we use graphical checks of the random walks as well as the gelman & rubin @xmath196 statistic ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a more detailed description of our implementation we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we performed two sets of mcmc calculations : one for isotropic @xmath197 mass models and one for radially anisotropic @xmath198 mass models . in both cases we sampled @xmath177 at @xmath199 logarithmically spaced radii .",
    "we performed some exploratory calculations with a range of values for @xmath200 .",
    "our chosen value reflects the balance between an adequate resolution of @xmath177 and a reasonable convergence speed of the mcmcs .",

    "we discarded a total of @xmath203 iterations as a `` burn in '' period for the chains .",
    "once we have our set of trial models it is straightforward to establish the , e.g. , 95% credible region for a given @xmath181 by determining the range in @xmath181 that encompasses 95% of all the trial models .",
    "implicit in this determination is the marginalization of the posterior probability over all the other @xmath204 .",
    "likewise we calculate the corresponding confidence regions for , say , @xmath205 and gauge how well our models can match the data .",
    "the results of our calculations are summarized in figure  [ f : n3379_mcmc ] with credible regions of 99% , 90% , and 50% .    to provide some context we obtained the best - fit models for three parametric mass models : a hernquist density profile @xmath206 @xcite , an nfw profile @xmath207 @xcite , and a pseudo - isothermal profile @xmath208 @xcite , where in all cases @xmath209 with @xmath210 the appropriate scale length ; all three models have a second parameter @xmath211 that scales the density .",
    "the best - fit models maximize the likelihood of the data  defined in equation  [ e : likelihood]by varying @xmath212 , but keeping @xmath163 fixed , i.e. we do not assume a constant mass - to - light ratio for these models .",
    "they appear as the ( red ) curves in figure  [ f : n3379_mcmc ] .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ f : n3379_mcmc ] show that the non - parametric description of @xmath177 has more leeway than the parametric models in matching the actual data , especially around 1  kpc where the two sides of the galaxy have significantly different velocity dispersions and at the outer edges , where the pne show a steep drop in velocity dispersion .",
    "we emphasize that our method does not bin the pne velocities ; the figure shows binned pn data for clarity .",
    "the core radii of the parametric models are quite small , an indicator of the failure of these mass models : the anisotropic hernquist model has the largest scalelength with 0.6  kpc , the pseudo - isothermal model the smallest with 1.15  pc . a pseudo - isothermal profile , unsurprisingly , is not able to reproduce the data , because of its nearly constant velocity dispersion ; the hernquist and nfw profiles do better , but still show a clear bias , justifying our choice for a non - parametric approach .",
    "the difference between the two sets of models , at least in terms of matching the data , is a widening of the credibility contours in the case of the anisotropic models .",
    "( the results from mb for ngc  3379 in their figure  3 show a similar widening . )",
    "whether or not this is a significant difference can be answered by calculating the odds ratio ( see equation  14 of mb ) of the isotropic versus the anisotropic hypothesis : @xmath213 typically , an odds ratio @xmath214 is considered to be conclusive in favoring one hypothesis over another .",
    "since we do not have any _ a priori _ preference for the value of @xmath215 , the odds ratio reduces to the ratio of the average values of the posterior distributions . in the case of the parametric models @xmath216 , implying either hypothesis is equally likely . from the mcmcs we find @xmath217 in favor of isotropy , which is a hint , but hardly conclusive .",
    "as mb noted , this is not a surprising result : barring information about the higher order velocity moments @xmath177 has enough freedom to match to data , given some value ( or even profile ) for @xmath215 .",
    "the little information of these higher order moments encoded in the pn velocities is clearly not enough to be a useful discriminant .",
    "the circular velocity in both sets of models is flat between 1 and 4  kpc at roughly @xmath218 , but drops of rapidly outside the latter radius , matching the results of ( * ? ? ?",

    "the agreement with the analysis of mb is less convincing at large radii , a consequence of their use of the smaller @xcite pn sample .",
    "the largest difference between the two sets is within 0.6  kpc , where the anisotropic models need significantly less mass than the isotropic models to produce the same velocity dispersion profile .",
    "this is simply a reflection of degeneracy between mass and velocity anisotropy , which can only be broken by the inclusion of higher order moments velocity data ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the top panels of figure  [ f : n3379_mcmc ] show a constant @xmath177 between 0.1 and 2  kpc , before showing a small hump followed by a steep decrease at larger radii .",
    "the range in @xmath177 is consistent with the range found by @xcite for ngc  3379 from stellar population synthesis .",
    "the bump is related to the diverging velocity dispersion data points outside 1  kpc and creates a small plateau in the model velocity dispersion .",
    "the flaring of the @xmath177 credibility contours shows that the constraints on the mass - to - light profile from the pne are weaker than those from the long slit spectra , but are nonetheless informative within 10  kpc .",
    "compare the parametric models with their associated mass - to - light profiles : they agree fairly well with @xmath177 within 1  kpc ( long slit spectra ) , but diverge strongly in the region dominated by the pn data . despite this fact",
    ", the parametric models only allow us to conclude that the mass density should fall off steeper than @xmath219 , but can not discriminate between a hernquist or an nfw profile .",
    "the non - parametric estimate @xmath177 , however , not only matches the data better , but also gives us hints of a breakdown of our assumptions ( a plateau instead of a flaring of confidence contours ) .",
    "most remarkable , however , remains the relative flatness of @xmath177 .",
    "the implied total mass within 8  kpc is @xmath220 , a factor of a few smaller than the tme estimate in section  [ s : samp3379 ] .",
    "the total mass - to - light ratio implied is @xmath221 , consistent with the stellar population models of @xcite .",
    "the conclusion that our data show little evidence for dm in the inner 8  kpc of ngc  3379 is hardly surprising in the light of the work done by @xcite , @xcite , and  more recently@xcite .",
    "in particular , a cursory inspection of the pn data in figure  3 of @xcite shows a striking resemblance to the similar data in our figure  [ f : n3379_mcmc ] : a steep drop off in velocity dispersion between @xmath222 and @xmath223 . using a parametric model that guaranteed a positive distribution function they found no significant signature for the presence of dm within @xmath224 with @xmath225 and @xmath221 consistent with our own findings .",
    "the investigations by @xcite , based on absorption line spectra out to @xmath226 , arrive at the same but more general conclusion : ellipticals likely have nearly maximal mass - to - light ratios . specifically , they find @xmath227 .    on the basis of",
    "orbit superposition modeling @xcite determined a mass - to - light ratio for ngc  3379 in the @xmath1 band of @xmath228 .",
    "their sample included about @xmath229 pne and also showed the radial decline in velocity dispersion .",
    "indeed , they found the same decline in three more galaxies and concluded that elliptical galaxies contain little dm when compared to other galaxies .",
    "considering the range in modeling procedures employed to study the dynamics of ngc  3379 and the consistency of the results , it is fair to say that it shows no evidence for dark matter within the inner few effective radii . at the same time ,",
    "analysis of the hi  ring around ngc  3379 and ngc  3384 implies an enclosed mass of @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the total dynamical mass - to - light ratio @xmath231 within the 110  kpc ring @xcite and within a 10  kpc radius of ngc  3379 suggests that most of the dark matter is at large radii .",
    "our models might not capture the complexity of ngc  3379 acceptably .",
    "the galaxy is not perfectly spherical and might even be an s0 seen face on @xcite , but as @xcite have observed , either possibility is unlikely to have a large effect on our final answer .",
    "the fact , noted by @xcite , that the long slit data show a bump in the @xmath232 moment at @xmath233 is interesting in this regard as an indication of a more complex description for ngc  3379 than incorporated in our model .",
    "the twists in the photometric surface brightness and the kinematic velocity field ( both roughly 5 degrees , but in opposite directions ) already hint at such a departure from our assumptions .",
    "@xcite suggest that ngc  3379 might be triaxial .",
    "the system might also not have adequately relaxed .",
    "indeed , the asymmetry of the velocity dispersion profile beyond @xmath234 seems to corroborate the latter possibility , despite the lack of photometric evidence .",
    "a more worrisome development , from a recent paper @xcite , is the discovery of two populations of pne in ngc  4697 , one younger and inherently brighter than the other , creating a bias in the measurements of the pn kinematics .",
    "given its somewhat odd velocity field , it is entirely possible that ngc  3379 contains a bimodal population of pne . a sample size of 50  pne , however , is clearly unable to address these questions usefully . a larger sample of ellipticals combined with deeper observations are needed to investigate the relevant statistics .",
    "we have reported on a search for pne around four early - type galaxies using the rfp .",
    "we obtained reasonably sized samples in the case of the two leo galaxies , ngc  3379 and ngc  3384 , with adequate photometry and well determined radial velocities .",
    "the main limiting factor in our observations was the seeing ; our data are read noise limited and better seeing would have improved the limiting magnitude of our survey . in our analysis of the rfp data",
    "cubes two realizations were essential in optimizing the size of the extracted pn samples .",
    "the power of our detections comes from using the data cube as a whole , as opposed to looking for point sources in each monochromatic rfp image .",
    "secondly , applying the proper statistic is essential , along with a proper characterization of the reference distribution . a simple estimator yields mass - to - light ratios @xmath235 for the leo galaxies , although a more sophisticated analysis for ngc  3379 gives an estimate that is a factor two lower , making it consistent with stellar population mass - to - light ratios .",
    "although our models are relatively simple , they do produce conservative estimates of the mass - to - light ratios , and hence we do not find evidence for a dominant dm component inside a few @xmath14 , confirming the recent work by @xcite .    in order to address questions about the existence of multimodal pn populations or the properties of pn kinematics as a function of host galaxy luminosity , we clearly need a larger and deeper set of surveyed galaxies",
    ". the rfp has been decommissioned , but successor instruments will be coming online in the very near future .",
    "the prime focus imaging spectrograph on the southern african large telescope ( 11  m ) will have fabry - perot image spectroscopy as one of its modes and will be ideally suited to extend current surveys of extragalactic pne .",
    "it will be both competitive , considering depth and field of view , and complementary , being on the southern hemisphere , to the planetary nebulae spectrograph @xcite .",
