    "in the past two decades we have witnessed a booming period in neutrino physics thanks to a number of indisputable observations of atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillations @xcite , and thus achieved a smoking gun for the incompleteness of the standard model ( sm ) in particle physics  the neutrinos actually have finite rest masses and the lepton flavors are significantly mixed , motivating us to explore the other unknowns of massive neutrinos beyond the sm and search for their possible consequences in nuclear physics , particle astrophysics and cosmology .    in the standard three - flavor scheme",
    "there are six neutrino oscillation parameters : two independent neutrino mass - squared differences ( e.g. , @xmath5 and @xmath20 ) , three lepton flavor mixing angles ( i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and one cp - violating phase ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) . among them",
    ", the sign of @xmath25 and the size of @xmath24 remain unknown @xcite . but",
    "some preliminary hints for @xmath26 and @xmath27 have recently been seen by combining the t2k @xcite and no@xmath8a @xcite data on @xmath28 oscillations with the daya bay ( reactor @xmath29 oscillation @xcite ) and super - kamiokande ( atmospheric @xmath30 oscillation @xcite ) data @xcite .",
    "provided @xmath24 is really around @xmath31 or takes a nontrivial value far away from @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then remarkable cp- and t - violating effects will emerge in some upcoming long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .    among a number of ongoing and proposed accelerator - based experiments which aim to probe or constrain cp violation in neutrino oscillations @xcite , those with the beam energy @xmath14 gev ( e.g. , t2k @xcite , moment @xcite and ess@xmath8sm @xcite )",
    "are expected to involve much smaller terrestrial matter effects . to understand the salient features of the matter - corrected @xmath28 and @xmath34 oscillations in this energy region , it is important to expand their probabilities in terms of two small expansion parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the fermi constant and @xmath39 being the background density of electrons .",
    "but the previous analytical approximations in this connection , such as the popular one developed by freund @xcite , are usually subject to @xmath40 gev and will become invalid when @xmath12 approaches vanishing . ) @xcite , but we are going to show that they will become problematic in the @xmath41 gev region and definitely turn to be invalid in the @xmath42 gev region . ] the reason is simply that mainly the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments with @xmath43 gev were considered in those works .",
    "hence our present work is well motivated to offer the hitherto most systematic and useful analytical approximations for terrestrial matter effects on cp violation in the medium - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments with the beam energy @xmath14 gev .",
    "the strength of cp and t violation in neutrino oscillations is measured by a universal and rephasing - invariant quantity of the @xmath44 pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath45 @xcite , the so - called jarlskog parameter @xmath46 @xcite defined via @xmath47 where the greek and latin subscripts run over @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "when a neutrino beam travels through a medium , it can see two kinds of refractive indices because of its interactions with the constituents of the medium ( i.e. , electrons , protons and neutrons ) via the weak neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) @xcite .",
    "all the three neutrino flavors share a common  matter \" phase due to the refractive index arising from the nc forward scattering , but the electron neutrinos develop an extra  matter \" phase owing to the cc forward scattering .",
    "the latter is nontrivial , and hence it is likely to change the neutrino oscillation behavior . in this case one may define the matter - corrected neutrino masses @xmath50 and the corresponding pmns matrix @xmath51 , so as to express the probabilities of neutrino oscillations in matter in the same way as those in vacuum . for example , the t - violating asymmetry between the probabilities of @xmath28 and @xmath52 oscillations in matter is given by @xcite and @xmath53 is not so simple as that of @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , as one can clearly see in section 4 . ]",
    "@xmath55 in which @xmath12 denotes the neutrino beam energy , @xmath56 is the distance between a neutrino source and the detector , @xmath9 and @xmath57 are the matter - corrected counterparts of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( for @xmath60 ) , respectively .",
    "it is known that @xmath61 exactly holds for a constant matter profile @xcite . but a more transparent relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath46 , which can directly tell us why or how cp violation in matter is enhanced or suppressed as compared with that in vacuum , has been lacking .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath46 ( or @xmath9 ) is in principle a measurable quantity , but in practice it is not directly observable since it is always correlated with the oscillation terms as shown in eq .",
    "however , a careful study of the ratio @xmath62 changing with the neutrino ( or antineutrino ) beam energy @xmath12 is not only conceptually interesting but also practically indispensable for expanding the matter - corrected oscillation probabilities @xmath63 and @xmath64 in terms of the afore - defined small parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the @xmath14 gev region .",
    "so we plan to organize the remaining parts of this paper in an easy - to - follow and step - by - step way : starting from the analytical approximation of @xmath67 , passing through those of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( for @xmath71 ) , and ending with those of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in section 2 we aim to reveal a unique range of the _ neutrino _ beam energy @xmath12 in which the size of the effective jarlskog invariant @xmath9 can be enhanced as compared with its fundamental counterpart @xmath46 .",
    "we find that @xmath72 will hold if @xmath12 is below the upper limit @xmath73 gev in a realistic oscillation experiment .",
    "in particular , we find that @xmath62 peaks at the resonance energy @xmath74 \\ ; , \\ ] ] which is about @xmath75 gev ( or @xmath11 gev ) for @xmath27 ( or @xmath76 ) , corresponding to the normal ( or inverted ) neutrino mass ordering .",
    "accordingly , we arrive at the maximum value @xmath77 \\ ; , \\ ] ] which is roughly @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) for @xmath27 ( or @xmath76 ) . as for an _ antineutrino _ beam",
    ", @xmath62 decreases monotonically in the @xmath80 gev region and thus does not undergo any resonances . in this sense one may draw the conclusion that a medium - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment with @xmath12 being in the range @xmath13 should be able to explore leptonic cp violation with little matter - induced suppression . in ref .",
    "@xcite . in comparison ,",
    "our analytical result in eq .",
    "( 3 ) has a much higher degree of accuracy and thus the new result in eq .",
    "( 4 ) can explain the sensitivity of @xmath81 to the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "] in section 3 we concentrate on a geometrical description of leptonic cp violation in matter and make some analytical approximations for this intuitive and useful language .",
    "namely , we show how the three dirac unitarity triangles ( uts ) in the complex plane @xcite , , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) , the so - called majorana uts @xcite , will not be discussed here because they have nothing to do with leptonic cp and t violation in normal neutrino - neutrino and antineutrino - antineutrino oscillations . ]",
    "defined through the orthogonality relations @xmath84 are modified ( either enlarged or suppressed ) by terrestrial matter effects in a low - energy medium - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "we find that the third side of each ut ( i.e. , @xmath85 , @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) is essentially insensitive to the matter - induced corrections when the neutrino beam energy @xmath12 is low , but the other two sides  both their sizes and orientations  can get appreciable corrections .",
    "besides some new and useful analytical results to be obtained in a reasonably good approximation , a numerical illustration of the real shapes of the effective dirac uts in matter ( denoted as @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) changing with @xmath12 will also be presented .    in section 4",
    "we aim to combine our new results about @xmath9 and @xmath91 ( for @xmath92 ) with the probabilities of neutrino oscillations in matter .",
    "in particular , the effective probabilities @xmath63 and @xmath64 are expanded in the whole @xmath14 gev region with the help of the small quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we show that our analytical approximations are numerically more accurate than those made by freund in this energy region , and thus they are particularly applicable for the study of leptonic cp violation in the low - energy moment , ess@xmath8sm and t2k oscillation experiments . we also affirm that a medium - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment with the beam energy @xmath12 lying in the @xmath93 range is capable of exploring leptonic cp violation with little matter - induced suppression .",
    "given the effective neutrino masses @xmath50 and the effective lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath51 which have accommodated the matter - induced corrections to @xmath94 and @xmath45 , the effective hamiltonian responsible for the propagation of a neutrino beam in matter can be written as @xcite @xmath95 = \\frac{1}{2 e } \\left[u \\begin{pmatrix } m^2_1 & 0 & 0 \\cr 0 & m^2_2 & 0 \\cr 0 & 0 & m^2_3 \\cr \\end{pmatrix } u^\\dagger + \\begin{pmatrix } a & 0 & 0 \\cr 0 & 0 & 0 \\cr 0 & 0 & 0 \\cr \\end{pmatrix } \\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] in which @xmath96 denotes the charged - current contribution to the coherent @xmath97 forward scattering in matter .",
    "when a constant terrestrial matter profile is concerned , as in the present work , eq .",
    "( 6 ) allows one to derive the following relation between the fundamental jarlskog invariant @xmath98 and its matter - corrected counterpart @xmath9 : @xmath99 which is a reflection of both the naumov relation @xcite and the toshev relation @xcite .",
    "the latter means @xmath100 in the standard parametrization of @xmath45 and @xmath51 .",
    "namely , @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( for @xmath104 ) .",
    "the parametrization of @xmath51 is exactly the same as that of @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( 8) , and hence one may obtain @xmath105 and the same expression of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "note , however , that eq .",
    "( 7 ) is actually a parametrization - independent result .",
    "we shall use it to establish an approximate but more transparent relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath9 later on .",
    "in fact , the exact relations between @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( for @xmath71 ) have been derived by several authors with the help of eq .",
    "( 6 ) @xcite , but only the normal neutrino mass ordering ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) was assumed in those works .",

    "although eqs .",
    "( 9)(11 ) are exact , they are unable to reveal the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath59 in a transparent way .",
    "it is therefore important to make reasonable analytical approximations in this connection , so as to simplify the relations between @xmath57 and @xmath59 .",

    "the situation is similar for the second peak of @xmath444 . of course , a realistic experiment should optimize both @xmath12 and @xmath56 to make @xmath444 easily observable .",
    ".the benchmark values of @xmath12 , @xmath56 , @xmath444 and @xmath451 associated with the first and second peaks of the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath442 shown in fig . 10 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     furthermore , we plot the effective probabilities @xmath63 and @xmath64 changing with the baseline length @xmath56 in fig . 11 , where the inputs are exactly the same as those used for plotting fig . 10 . since these two probabilities depend on @xmath452 respectively , they receive different contributions from terrestrial matter effects and thus their peaks correspond to different values of @xmath56 .",
    "the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath64 is just the cp - violating asymmetry @xmath444 as illustrated in fig .",
    "note that @xmath444 is essentially insensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy in the leading - order approximation , because it is dominated by the @xmath431 term which is insensitive to the sign of @xmath25 .",
    "this observation implies that a reasonable determination of the cp - violating effect in the lepton sector ( or equivalently , the size of @xmath24 ) should in principle be possible in such a low - energy medium - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment even before the sign of @xmath25 is measured .",
    "we hope that some of our results obtained in this work will be helpful for the design of a low - energy oscillation experiment to explore leptonic cp violation .",
    "the proposed moment project @xcite is just an experiment of this type .",
    "the neutrino flux of the moment is expected to peak in the @xmath453 region , which happens to coincide with the @xmath93 region recommended above . in other words ,",
    "this experiment is capable of probing the effects of cp violation in @xmath28 and @xmath454 oscillations with little matter - induced suppression .",
    "the present studies indicate that the optimal baseline length of the moment experiment should be around @xmath455 km @xcite , which is also within the expectation shown in figs .",
    "10 and 11 .",
    "but the bottlenecks to the physics reach of this experiment include how to achieve a sufficiently intense neutrino ( or antineutrino ) flux and how to achieve a sufficiently high suppression of the atmospheric neutrino background , as pointed out and discussed in depth by blennow _",
    ". @xcite . in this connection",
    "we plan to go into details of the feasibility and physics potential of the moment project elsewhere in collaboration with its team members @xcite .",
    "in addition to the moment facility , the ess@xmath8sb project  a very intense neutrino super - beam for the measurement of leptonic cp violation  has recently been proposed based on the european spallation source linac @xcite .",
    "its neutrino beam energy and baseline length are expected to lie in the @xmath456 range and the @xmath457 range , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the lower - energy and shorter - baseline part of this parameter space is consistent with our recommendation about @xmath12 and @xmath56 made above .",
    "in fact , our analytical approximations are valid for the whole space of @xmath12 and @xmath56 of the ess@xmath8sb experiment , and hence they will be very helpful to understand the numerical analysis of this experiment s sensitivity to cp violation and matter contamination @xcite .    we stress that a low - energy medium - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment can not only help probe leptonic cp violation but also help test the other properties of lepton flavor mixing .",
    "therefore , a further study of this possibility is desirable @xcite .",
    "we have developed a new set of analytical approximations for the probabilities of @xmath28 and @xmath2 oscillations in matter to understand the effects of leptonic cp violation in a possible low - energy medium - baseline experiment with the beam energy @xmath14 gev .",
    "our primary motivation comes from the fact that the previous works of this kind , such as the popular one done by freund @xcite , are subject to the @xmath43 gev ( or @xmath123 gev ) region for a long - baseline oscillation experiment .",
    "we have shown that our analytical approximations are numerically more accurate than those made by freund in the @xmath0 gev region , and thus they are expected to be particularly applicable for the moment , ess@xmath8sm and t2k experiments .",
    "the new analytical approximations can also help us to easily understand why the matter - corrected jarlskog parameter @xmath9 peaks at the resonance energy @xmath10 gev ( or @xmath11 gev ) for the normal ( or inverted ) neutrino mass hierarchy , and how the three dirac unitarity triangles are deformed due to the terrestrial matter contamination .",
    "finally we have affirmed that a medium - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment with the beam energy @xmath12 lying in the @xmath93 range is capable of exploring leptonic cp violation with little matter - induced suppression .",
    "of course , more detailed works have to be done to combine our analytical results with a given experiment , such as the moment project , by considering both the neutrino beam issues and the detector issues .",
    "we plan to focus on such important but complicated issues elsewhere in collaboration with the moment team @xcite .",
    "we are indebted to yu - feng li and shun zhou for their useful discussions and comments .",
    "one of us ( z.z.x . ) is also grateful to fumihiro takayama for his warm hospitality during the chinese new year at the yukawa institute for theoretical physics of kyoto university , where part of this work was done .",
