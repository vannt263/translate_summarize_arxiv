    "the solid line in each panel is the mah of the corresponding cluster halo . to construct these curves for each one of the 14 halos identified at z=0 , we track down its most massive progenitor in the various redshifts for which there is a simulation output.the dashed curves are the best fits of the formula we propose in tasitsiomi et al .",

    "( 2002 ) based on the mahs of mostly galactic halos is shown with the dotted curves . even though it is a good fit for most cluster halos",
    ", it does not seem adequate for all clusters .",
    "the clusters which are not described well by this fit have mahs which are close to a power law in the scale factor .",
    "also given is the formation redshift , @xmath12 , of each halo calculated via the logarithmic mass accretion rate .",
    "clearly , cluster halos are newly formed objects  some are still forming ( @xmath13 ) . despite the large mah diversity",
    ", there is a typical mah ; it consists of 2 phases , an early ( @xmath14 ) , major merger dominated phase , and a later ( @xmath15 ) , slower accretion phase .",
    "* figure [ figure_profile ] . * density profiles and three profile analytical fits for three of the simulated clusters ( middle panel of each figure ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the fractional deviation of the three fits from the data , and the top panels show the local logarithmic profile slope as measured from the density profile ( points ) , as well as the predictions for the running of the slope from the three analytic fits .",
    "we find that there is no unique best fit analytic form for all clusters .",
    "cl1 is representative of clusters best fit by the moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and cl3 by the navarro , frank , and white ( nfw ; 1996 ) profile . in accordance with the large mah diversity",
    ", the concentration indices calculated from the best fits vary from 2.3 to 14.7 for a relatively narrow mass range .",
    "the logarithmic slope obtained by averaging between the smallest resolved radius and 3@xmath16 of the virial radius is equally diverse , varying from -1.23 to -2.01 .",
    "opposite to previous claims , there are no indications for an asymptotic slope being reached , at least not down to our smallest resolved radius .",
    "we do not find a correlation between the inner slope and @xmath12 , or the shape of the mah .",
    "what we do find is shown at the right panel : shown is one of the clusters that are currently undergoing rapid mass accretion and , in our definitions , has not formed yet .",
    "these objects which are still in their first mah phase , when the inner part of the halo is formed , are single power law like over a large range of scales , and have accordingly low concentration indices .",

    "the profiles at @xmath17 are scaled down by a factor of 10 with respect to each other . also shown are the best fit nfw ( dotted lines ) and jing & suto ( js ; 2000 ) ( dashed lines ) profiles .",
    "the inner profile is set up early on , in most cases during the period of rapid , major merger dominated accretion , it is almost a power law ( same as cl9 in figure [ figure_profile ] ) , and remains fairly intact when the outer parts of the halo are built during the second , milder mass accretion era . in most cases , as those shown in the figure ,",
    "the best fit analytic form at z=0 , is also the best fit in the past .",
    "for example , for the cluster shown in the left panel , the best fit analytic form is always the js density profile , whereas for the cluster on the right panel it is the nfw .",
    "* figure [ concentrations]*. _ left panel : _ median concentration vs. virial mass at different redshifts for the progenitors of clusters in our sample ( points ) .",
    "the vertical error bars represent the 1-@xmath18 scatter in concentration , while the horizontal ones show the mass range of the halos at each epoch .",
    "the predictions of well known and mostly based on galactic size halo samples c(m@xmath19,z ) recipes are shown with thick ( bullock et al . , 2001 ) and thin ( eke , navarro , and steinmetz , 2001 ) lines . _",

    "the error bars in both panels show the 1- @xmath18 spread around the mean .",
    "the figure shows that the concentration of cluster halos relate tightly to the mah : during the period of fast mass growth the concentration remains approximately constant and low (  3 - 4 ) , whereas during the slow accretion period the concentration increases with decreasing z as @xmath21 .",
