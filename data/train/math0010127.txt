    "for example , the boundary of a principal @xmath179-cell labeled by @xmath327 with @xmath328 zeros are written in the sum of the principal and the whisker parts of @xmath329-cells .",
    "we then define a boundary map @xmath330 on the principal @xmath179-cells into the projection of the boundary map @xmath331 on the principal parts of @xmath329-cells : @xmath332 for the bounary of the top cell , we have @xmath333\\langle s_{i1}\\rangle   + [ e;s_{il}]\\langle s_{il}\\rangle \\big ) ~,\\ ] ] where the incidence numbers are computed as @xmath334=[e;s_{l - i+1,l}]=2(-1)^{i+1}(1-\\delta_{il})~.\\ ] ] thus the principal part of the boundary of the top cell consists of @xmath335 cells of @xmath319-type , and the cells @xmath336 and @xmath337 are _ not _ in the part of the boundary .",

    ". then one can identify the cells which are not included in any parts of the boundaries of @xmath323-type as in the following proposition ,    [ prince ] all the cells which are free from the boundaries of cells with higher indices are generated by the following commutative diagram starting from @xmath340 , @xmath341 where @xmath342 represents a unique cell labeled with @xmath343 .",
    "the braid relation @xmath344=[i+1\\cdot i\\cdot i+1]$ ] shows the commutativity of the diagram .",
    "one can also show in a similar way as in ( [ topb ] ) that the principal part of the boundary of the @xmath342 consists of @xmath345 cells and is given by @xmath346 where @xmath347 , and the cells @xmath348 and @xmath349 do not appear .",

    "for the case of @xmath360 , we identify the seed cell @xmath361 as the face ( square ) , the cells in @xmath362 as the edges , and those in @xmath363 as the vertices . then counting the numbers of those cells , we obtain    [ h1complex ] the generating function ( poincar polynomial ) @xmath364 of the number of cells @xmath365 is given by @xmath366    it is easy to see that the number of @xmath179-dimensional cells @xmath367 in the @xmath20-dimensional hypercube",
    "is given by @xmath368 so that we have @xmath369 from proposition [ prince ] , we have @xmath20 number of the @xmath370 dimensional hypercubes in the principal graph .",

    "although we have a complete characterization of the cells in terms of colored dynkin diagrams ( section 3 ) , we have not obtained explicitly higher homology .",
    "it is however natural to consider the following conjecture on the betti numbers @xmath378 as the alternative sums of the numbers of _ whiskers _ : @xmath379 where @xmath380 is the number of whiskers defined by @xmath381 note here that all the @xmath179-cycles are given by the products of @xmath359-cycles , i.e. @xmath382 . the conjecture is confirmed for the cases of @xmath283 up to @xmath284 .",
