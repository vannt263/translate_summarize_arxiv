    "the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) enjoys a special status .",
    "the higgs bilinear @xmath0 is the only gauge and lorentz invariant dimension2 operator that can be constructed out of the sm fields .",
    "this operator can couple to the `` hidden '' sector at the renormalizable level @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an sm singlet .",
    "more general allowed couplings include , for example , a coupling to massive vectors @xcite and a scalar curvature @xcite , which could be relevant to dark matter and inflation , respectively . in the case of a scalar higgs portal , the phenomenology depends crucially on whether or not @xmath2 develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "if it does , the higgs boson mixes with the singlet @xcite , otherwise @xmath2 becomes a good dak matter candidate @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the first possibility . a significant higgs ",
    "singlet mixing can be probed at the lhc @xcite by measuring production cross sections for the higgs  like states , whereas the small mixing ( @xmath3 10% ) case is much more challenging .    in this paper , we explore some consequences of an unobservably small higgs  singlet mixing .",
    "we find , in particular , that such a mixing together with tiny singlet couplings can stabilize the electroweak ( ew ) vacuum , which otherwise appears metastable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can lead to a significant ( @xmath4 ) tree ",
    "level modification of the higgs self  coupling , which can be measured at colliders . finally , although higgs inflation within the sm is disfavored by the tentative 125 gev higgs signal seen at the lhc @xcite , such a possibility remains open in our framework .",
    "we start by reviewing properties of the higgs portal potential following ref .",
    "related work can be found in @xcite .      the scalar potential in the unitary gauge @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real fields ; @xmath9 are the quartic couplings and @xmath10 are mass parameters . in what follows , we will be interested in the case when both @xmath7 and @xmath8 develop non  zero vevs . denoting @xmath11 , extremization of the low energy scalar potential ( [ v ] )",
    "requires @xmath12 the diagonal matrix elements of the hessian at this point are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while its determinant is @xmath15 .",
    "then , the extremum is a local minimum if @xmath16 in this case , the mass squared eigenvalues are @xmath17 with the mixing angle @xmath18 given by @xmath19 following the convention of @xcite , the mixing angle is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a 2@xmath222 mass squared matrix .",
    "the range of @xmath18 is related to the ordering of the eigenvalues through @xmath23 and we take @xmath24 to be the smaller eigenvalue . the mass eigenstates are @xmath25 note that the lighter mass eigenstate @xmath26 is `` higgs  like '' for @xmath27 and `` singlet  like '' otherwise .",
    "the former case corresponds to @xmath28 .      in the limit @xmath29",
    ", we have @xmath30 where the neglected terms are suppressed by @xmath31 . as @xmath32 increases , @xmath33 and the singlet  higgs mixing approaches zero .",
    "the light eigenstate @xmath26 is almost a pure higgs , yet its mass squared is not @xmath14 as in the sm , but receives a finite negative correction @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , a given higgs mass corresponds to a @xmath35 @xmath36 than what it would be in the standard model .    a 125 gev higgs",
    "can then be obtained for various @xmath36 up to order one as long as @xmath37 as a result , all the couplings can remain positive at all scales , ensuring stability of the potential .",
    "this can be achieved with tiny @xmath38 and @xmath39 as long as @xmath40 is significant .",
    "as one increases @xmath29 ( while keeping both states as relevant degrees of freedom at a given energy scale ) , the effect on the light eigenvalue remains finite .",
    "the sm result is not recovered due to the large cross term @xmath41 , although the light state is ( almost ) exactly sm  like .",
    "the cross term generates a leading order @xmath42 correction to the determinant of the mass squared matrix , resulting in a finite shift in @xmath24 .    rewriting @xmath43 one finds that the @xmath44 limit means that both @xmath45 and @xmath46 increase in magnitude indefinitely , while @xmath47 .",
    "the hierarchy between @xmath48 and @xmath32 is then equivalent to tuning of @xmath49 to this value .",
    "note also that the vacuum energy is negative and scales like @xmath50 .    since the singlet",
    " higgs mixing can be very small , this scenario is essentially indistinguishable from the sm apart from the higgs quartic coupling .",
    "suppose that both mass eigenstates are sufficiently light so that they are degrees of freedom of our tev ",
    "scale effective theory , @xmath51 with @xmath52(tev ) . given the higgs mass @xmath53 ( which we also identify with @xmath24 ) ,",
    "the quartic couplings are given by @xmath54 for a tev  scale singlet , the correction to the quartic higgs coupling can be of order 100% , whereas the gauge ",
    "higgs coupling is modified by less than 10% .",
    "an ilc @xcite or high  luminosity lhc @xcite study of the higgs self  coupling would then be able to reveal the presence of the singlet .",
    "if the singlet is very heavy , @xmath55 the effective low energy theory contains just the higgs doublet and the higgs mass  coupling relation is not affected @xcite .",
    "the quartic coupling receives the singlet  induced contribution above the singlet threshold , which has an analogous stabilizing effect . in this case",
    ", the mixing @xmath56 can be as small as @xmath57 with the constraint coming from `` activating '' the singlet below the sm instability scale .",
    "the quartic couplings at high energies are determined by the following 1loop renormalization group equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the energy scale .",
    "the effect of the heavy singlet threshold can be included by inserting appropriate heaviside @xmath18functions .",
    "the rg equations for the gauge and the top yukawa couplings are given by the usual sm expressions .",
    "the low energy input values for these couplings are @xmath61 , while for the top yukawa coupling we use its running value at @xmath62 , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "a two  loop sm running of @xmath36 as well as finite corrections are considered in a recent analysis @xcite ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . within the uncertainties of @xmath62 , our 1loop sm results are consistent with theirs .",

    ", width=377 ]    figure [ f1 ] displays a few possible choices of low energy couplings consistent with @xmath65 gev and the resulting evolution of @xmath36 with energy .",
    "we have chosen small couplings @xmath66 in which case the singlet loop contribution to @xmath36 is suppressed , as is the singlet threshold effect ( for definiteness , we have set the singlet mass to be sub ",
    "tev ) . for @xmath67",
    "greater than about 0.015 , the higgs quartic coupling is positive at all scales .",
    "as seen from the rg equations , @xmath39 remains positive if it is positive at low energies .",
    "this also applies to @xmath38 as its evolution is dominated by the top ",
    "quark contribution .",
    "the potential is therefore positive  definite at high energies and the ew vacuum is stable . note that this result can be achieved with tiny @xmath68 and @xmath69 since what matters is @xmath67 .",
    "analogous examples can be constructed for @xmath70 as well . in that case",
    ", one must obey the additional constraint @xmath71 at all scales .",
    "even though this quantity is positive in the low energy limit , it may turn negative at higher energies signifying the existence of a run ",
    "away direction .",
    "this illustrates how the electroweak vacuum can be stabilized by invoking a heavy scalar which has practically no observable effects other than changing the higgs self  coupling . in that case , the bound on the reheating temperature @xcite relaxes and , furthermore , the higgs field can be responsible for inflation @xcite .",
    "one may also stabilize the higgs potential entirely by loop effects involving a relatively light singlet with a zero vev @xcite . as seen from the rg equations ,",
    "the singlet makes a positive contribution to @xmath36 , so a substantial cross coupling @xmath72 would stabilize the electroweak vacuum .",
    "although viable , this mechanism is quite constraining and the options for higgs  like inflation would be limited .",
    "in contrast , the tree ",
    "level mechanism described above works even for very small couplings and a heavy singlet providing ample opportunities for model building .",
    "scalar fields with the usual quartic potentials can drive inflation if they possess large couplings @xmath73 to scalar curvature @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "below we summarize basic ideas of higgs portal inflation , closely following ref .",
    "variants of this scenario which include dark matter considerations have appeared in @xcite .",
    "the relevant jordan frame lagrangian in the unitary gauge is @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the scalar couplings to curvature can be eliminated by a conformal transformation @xmath77 which brings us to the einstein frame .",
    "let us set @xmath78 to 1 and consider the limit @xmath79 at @xmath80 , the kinetic terms and the potential for new variables @xmath81 are given by @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "note that at large @xmath84 , the potential is independent of @xmath84 which allows for slow  roll inflation .",
    "the composition of the inflaton depends on the value of @xmath85 at the minimum of the potential .",
    "the minima of @xmath86 are classified as follows @xmath87 in all of these minima , the @xmath85 field is heavy ( @xmath88 in planck units ) and can be integrated out , leaving @xmath84 as the only dynamical variable during inflation .",
    "if we are to retain the subleading @xmath89 term in @xmath90 , the potential for @xmath84 becomes @xmath91 in planck units . here",
    "@xmath92 depends on the composition of the inflaton . for higgs inflation , @xmath93 ; for singlet inflation ,",
    "@xmath94 with @xmath95 ; and for mixed inflation , @xmath96    $ ] .    depending on the values of @xmath9 and @xmath97 , 3 variants of inflation are possible . since the shape of the potential is the same in all cases ( at tree level )",
    ", they all share the same prediction for the spectral index @xmath98 and the tensor to scalar perturbation ratio @xmath99 , with @xmath100 being the number of @xmath101-folds during inflation @xcite .",
    "obviously , the prerequisite for inflation is that the relevant @xmath102 be positive at high energies .",
    "then , given the low value of the higgs mass , higgs inflation becomes problematic @xcite . to revive this option",
    ", one may use the mechanism of @xmath36enhancement described in the previous section .",
    "although the minimalistic version of the original higgs inflation @xcite appears disfavored , the presence of an almost decoupled singlet can save the idea .",

    "( the sign of @xmath109 determines whether this is the only local minimum . )",
    "it follows then that @xmath38 must be positive , @xmath110 .",

    "this judicious choice is motivated by perturbativity ( @xmath112 ) all the way up to the planck scale .",
    "we take a conservative viewpoint @xcite and do not impose further constraints arising from loop corrections to the shape of the inflaton potential ( the `` running '' spectral index ) .",
