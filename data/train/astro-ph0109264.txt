    "recent results show that models reproduce fairly well the observed real spectra ( e.g. , audard et al .",
    "2001a , behar , cottam , & kahn 2001 ) , although a significant number of lines , mainly from si , s , ar , and ca l - shell lines , are either absent in the atomic databases or are not properly reproduced ( audard et al .",
    "we have therefore discarded wavelength regions where such lines dominate in order not to bias the spectral fitting convergence , and particularly to get more accurate elemental abundances .",
    "stellar coronal abundances have frequently been determined using the moderate spectral resolution of ccd spectra from _ asca _",

    ", abundance pattern in the sun : in brief , the solar corona and the solar wind display a so - called `` first ionization potential '' ( fip ) effect , for which the current consensus is that the abundances of low - fip ( @xmath0  ev ) elements are _ enhanced _ relative to their respective photospheric abundance , while the abundances of high - fip ( @xmath1  ev ) elements are photospheric ( e.g. , haisch , saba , & meyer 1996 ) .",
    "stellar coronal observations often showed a deficiency of metals relative to the _ solar _ photospheric abundances ( schmitt et al .",

    "( 2001 ) showed a trend towards enhanced high - fip elemental abundances ( normalized to o and relative to the solar photospheric abundances , anders & grevesse 1989 ) , while low - fip elemental abundances are depleted ; this effect was dubbed the `` inverse fip '' effect .",
    "subsequent studies of different active stars also showed such a trend ( gdel et al .",
    "2001ab ) , while the intermediately active binary capella showed neither a fip nor an ifip effect ( audard et al .",
    "however , we emphasize that stellar coronal abundances are often normalized to the _ solar _ photospheric abundances , while they should better be normalized to the _ stellar _ photospheric abundances .",
    "the latter are , however , difficult to measure because of the enhanced chromospheric activity , the high rotation rate and the presence of spots in active stars , particularly in rs cvn binaries . nevertheless , for some stars , photospheric abundances are known .",
    "gdel et al .",
    "( 2002 ; also in these proceedings ) discuss the transition from an ifip to a normal fip effect in the long - term evolution of the coronae from active to inactive solar analogs ; all targets have photospheric abundances indistinguishable from those of the sun , therefore suggesting that the observed transition is real .",
    "the apparent depletion of low - fip elements during quiescence should be contrasted with a significant increase of average metal abundances during flares ( e.g. , ottmann & schmitt 1996 , favata et al . 2000 ) . with the higher spectral resolution of _ asca _ ,",
    "individual elemental abundances were derived during time slices of a large flare in ux ari ( gdel et al .",
    "1999 ) ; low - fip elements were found to increase more significantly than the high - fip elements .",
    "recently , high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy of a flare in hr  1099 with _ xmm - newton _ identified similar behavior ( audard , gdel , & mewe 2001b ) .    in this paper , we present abundance patterns in rs cvn binary systems observed by _ xmm - newton_. our results generally show i ) a transition from an ifip effect to an absence of a fip bias with decreasing activity , compatible with a similar transition observed in solar analogs ( gdel et al .",

    "_ xmm - newton _ observed several rs cvn binary systems as part of the rgs stellar guaranteed time program . in this paper , we will concentrate on the quiescent observations of hr  1099 , ux ari , @xmath3  and , and capella .",
    "their light curves are shown in figure  1 .",
    "we have fitted simultaneously the rgs1 , rgs2 , and epic mos2 spectra ( except for capella where no epic data are available ) in xspec 11.0.1aj ( arnaud 1996 ) using the ` vapec ` model ( apec code with variable abundances ) .",
    "we have removed significant parts of the rgs spectra above 20     to take into account the inaccuracy and incompleteness of the atomic database for non - fe l - shell atomic transitions .",
    "additionally , some fe l - shell lines with inaccurate atomic data were not fitted .",
    "a free multiplicative constant model has been introduced for cross - calibration uncertainties , finite extraction region and , in the case of hr  1099 , the annulus - shaped extraction region .",
    "notice that the rgs1 and rgs2 each suffer from the loss of one ccd , but the combined spectra cover the whole rgs wavelength range ( see den herder et al .",
    "we have used either i ) a multi - temperature ( 5 t ) approach with free t , emission measures ( em ) and abundances ( the latter linked between the components ) , or ii ) 10 components on a grid of fixed t , but free em and free abundances ( linked between the components ) .",
    "both methods proved to give reasonable fits with similar abundances",
    ". therefore we will only give results from the 10-t approach .",
    "figure  2 shows the coronal abundances normalized to the o abundance in order to ease comparison between the different stars .",
    "note that the solar photospheric abundances from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) were used , except for the fe abundance that was taken from grevesse & sauval ( 1999 ) .",
    "the panels are ordered in decreasing activity from top to bottom . a clear trend for high - fip m / o ratios to significantly exceed low - fip m / o ratios",
    "is seen in the very active stars ( hr  1099 , ux ari ) , while for the less active , not tidally locked @xmath3 and , no clear correlation is observed .",
    "finally , in the intermediately active capella , any fip bias is absent with a possibility for a weak fip effect .",
    "the `` average '' temperature of a stellar corona is an indicator of activity .",
    "we define here @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the 10-t model temperatures and emission measures , respectively .",
    "the abundance ratios relative to o have been plotted against @xmath7 .",
    "figure  3 shows examples for the low - fip element fe and for the high - fip element ne .",
    "data points from solar analogs ( gdel et al .",
    "2002 and in these proceedings ) have been added ; both panels show a very different behavior in the abundance ratios : while the fe / o ratios exponentially decrease with increasing temperature , the ne / o ratios show no correlation with the average coronal temperature .",
    "other low - fip elements ( e.g. , mg , si ) show a similar trend .",
    "the above trends are given for `` quiescent '' x - ray coronae ; data from previous satellites showed that the metallicity z , or the fe abundance , generally increases during large flares .",
    "higher spectral resolution data showed that low - fip elements increased more significantly than the high - fip elements ( gdel et al .",
    "we reanalyzed the hr  1099 flare ( previously published by audard et al .",
    "2001b ) applying a more recent calibration .",
    "figure  4 shows the fe / o and ne / o ratios as a function of the average temperature during quiescence , flare rise , and flare peak .    consistently with our previous analysis ( audard et al .",
    "2001b ) and with previous results , the fe / h abundance increases during the flare ; however the ne / h abundance stays constant .",
    "after normalization with the o abundance , the fe / o ratio still increases and ne / o still remains constant , consistent with the picture that low - fip elements are enhanced during flares while high - fip elements stay equally abundant .",
    "this behavior of other low - fip elements and high - fip elements is analogous .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _ results show a correlation between the abundance pattern in active stars and the activity level .",
    "the bright and very active rs cvn binary systems show a coronal abundance enhancement for high - fip elements ( e.g. , c , n , o , ne ) compared to low - fip elements ( e.g. , fe , mg , si ) .",
    "we interpret this result as further evidence for an `` inverse first ionization potential '' effect such as found by brinkman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in a deep exposure of hr  1099 . our sample , containing hr  1099",
    ", ux ari , @xmath3 and , and capella , covers high to intermediate activity levels .",
    "the slope of the abundance ratios ( m / o ) as a function of the fip curve decreases with decreasing activity , with our `` least active '' rs cvn system ( capella ) suggesting either an absence of a fip bias or a weak fip effect ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "similarly , using the average coronal temperature as an activity indicator , we show that low - fip elemental abundances decrease with increasing temperature , while the high - fip abundances stay constant .",
    "note that evidently this behavior would change if abundances were normalized to a low - fip element such fe . however , absolute abundances suggest that _ only _ the low - fip elements are sensistive to the activity level , while this is not the case for the high - fip elements .",
    "such correlations correspond well to the long - term evolution from an ifip effect to a normal fip effect in solar analogs ( gdel et al .",
    "2002 ; also these proceedings ) .",
    "these latter stars are of solar photospheric composition . for most rs",
    "cvn binary systems , photospheric abundances are unknown , and when known , there is a large scatter in their measurements because they are difficult to derive from optical spectroscopy mainly due to chromospheric activity , high rotation velocities , and the presence of spots on the stellar surface .",
    "@xmath3 and is one of the rare cases with several measured photospheric abundances .",
    "we used the _ stellar _ abundances derived by donati , henry , & hall ( 1995 ) : a similar distribution as in fig .  2",
    "is obtained .",
    "notice that it is pivotal to measure accurate photospheric abundances in the most active stars that show a clear ifip effect ( e.g. , hr 1099 , ux ari ) and compare them with coronal abundances .",
    "it will allow us to verify whether low - fip elements really are depleted in the corona of the most active stars .",
