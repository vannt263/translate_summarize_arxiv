    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite that exists in systems with axial symmetry , plays a key role in spintronics @xcite realized with two - dimensional ( 2d ) carriers in semiconductor heterostructures as it allows to manipulate the spin by a gate - controlled confinement potential .",
    "spin - orbit ( so ) coupling mixes the spin states and removes the spin degeneracy for states with finite momentum . besides the rashba term caused by the asymmetry of the confinement , there exists also a so coupling due to the inversion asymmetry of the crystalline structure of the semiconductor bulk material ( dresselhaus term @xcite ) .",
    "both types of so coupling combine to an anisotropic spin - splitting of 2d electrons , which has been analyzed by inelastic light scattering @xcite and play a role also in weak localization studies @xcite .",
    "the intimate relation between spin splitting and spin relaxation , well - known for bulk material @xcite has found renewed interest for 2d electrons @xcite , furthered by the possibility to measure spin - relaxation times with monopolar optical orientation @xcite .",
    "the zero - field spin splitting @xcite has to compete with the zeeman spin - splitting if a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2d electron system .",
    "this results in a fan chart showing characteristic crossings of landau levels , which in magnetotransport data are detected as beating of the shubnikov de - haas ( sdh ) oscillations @xcite . for hole sytems ,",
    "the two so coupling mechanisms have been found to be responsible for anomalous sdh oscillations @xcite .",
    "the structural asymmetry of the confinement can be tuned into a regime where the rashba so coupling dominates over the bulk inversion asymmetry @xcite . in spite of this current interest in the rashba so coupling and its relevance for spin - related transport in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des )",
    "it is surprising that there is so far no rigorous magnetotransport calculation which takes this coupling into account .    here , we present fully quantum - mechanical calculations of the magnetoconductivity including the rashba so interaction .",
    "the calculations are based on the evaluation of the kubo formula with an extension of the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) by taking into account the electron spin degree of freedom .",
    "our results show besides the known beats in the sdh oscillations an additional modulation connected with the crossing of landau levels .",
    "this modulation , which is not seen in the density of states , arises as we take into account spin - conserving impurity scattering which is suppressed when the so coupled states are not degenerate .",
    "it survives even at higher temperatures , when sdh oscillations have died out , and could serve , if experimentally detected , as another fingerprint of so interaction . in lateral superlattices @xcite , where a 2des is subjected to a periodic potential ,",
    "there exist besides the sdh oscillations other @xmath0 periodic magnetotransport oscillations due to commensurability between cyclotron radius and lattice constant @xcite and due to the formation of a miniband structure @xcite . from our magnetotransport calculations for lateral superlattices with weak uni - directional ( 1d )",
    "modulation we predict a splitting of these periods due to so coupling and calculate their dependence on its strength and carrier density .    the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "after this introduction we describe in the section [ second_section ] the energy spectrum and the eigenstates of a 2des with rashba so interaction . for the calculation of the conductivity",
    "we simplify the energy spectum and introduce a constant spin - splitting model . in the section [ third_section ] the scba is extended by the spin degree of freedom to describe the scattering of spin - conserving impurities in a 2des with so interaction .",
    "the effects of this extension are illustrated for a two level system , where it is shown that for non - degenerate so coupled states the scattering efficiency is suppressed . in section [ sec_conductivity ]",
    "we present the conductivity and compare the cases with and without so coupling .",
    "finally in the section [ fifth_section ] we show results for a system with so interaction and a 1d periodic modulation and study in the power spectrum of the magnetoconductivity the evolution of the characteristic periods with increasing so coupling .",
