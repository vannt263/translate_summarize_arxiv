    "superconductivity is one of the most exotic states of matter , appearing in a broad range of systems in nature , from metallic superconductors to neutron stars .",
    "superconducting states stem from a condensation of cooper pairs , which are made of fermions with two different inner states with opposite momentum near each fermi surface .",
    "the different forms of the cooper pairs appear in various physical systems , such as those with different spins of electrons for metallic superconductors , those with different chirality of quarks for a dynamical mass generation in qcd , and those with different atomic states for superfluids in ultracold fermi gases .",
    "after the bcs theory was proposed , an exotic state called a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state was conjectured , in which the pair potential has spatial modulation @xcite .",
    "when a population imbalance exists between those different inner states , the difference of the sizes of the fermi surfaces results in a finite total momentum of the cooper pairs , yielding the fflo state .",
    "the modulation of the pair potentials can be classified into two classes : a phase modulation which is called the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state @xcite and an amplitude modulation which is called the larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state @xcite . when a persistent current exists , the pair potential becomes a plane wave like @xmath0 with a constant @xmath1 , resulting in a ff - like state .",
    "the population imbalance induced , for example , by a magnetic field on a quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) superconductor results in a lo state , described by a sine like shape , @xmath2 , with the elliptic parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the fflo states have been mostly analyzed thus far in the basis of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation in various systems , e.g. , the superconductor in magnetic field @xcite , superconductor - ferromagnet heterostructures @xcite .",
    "it is , however , known that the gl equation is only valid in the vicinity of the critical temperature .",
    "thus the gl formalism is not appropriate to discuss the lowest energy state at temperatures much lower than the critical temperature , where one has to use the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) formalism .",
    "recent developments of research in cold atomic fermi gases have renewed interest in the fflo state @xcite , and observation of a spin - polarized superfluid state was reported @xcite in which it is expected that the fflo state has been achieved . however , direct observation of its oscillating order parameter is still lacking .",
    "besides metallic superconductors and cold fermi gases , these states have been attracting much attention in qcd , because they are also expected to appear in chiral condensates or diquark condensates of quarks at high density and/or high temperature @xcite .",
    "however , in condensed matter systems , the direct confirmation of these states has not yet been achieved for 50 years since its proposal , in spite of tremendous efforts @xcite .    as a simple setup to realize phase and/or amplitude modulations",
    ", we consider a superconducting ring .",
    "when a ring is penetrated by a magnetic flux , the phase of the wave function on the ring depends on the magnetic flux even if magnetic field itself is not applied on the ring .",
    "this effect is known as the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect and can be used to make a persistent current for superconductors fabricated on a ring .",
    "the resulting pair potential becomes that of a ff - like state @xcite .",
    "when the population imbalance is induced , for example , by a magnetic field on the ring , excess particles which can not make a cooper pair appear .",
    "if we consider the pair potential as a background potential and focus on the energies of these excess particles , a normal state , the lo state , and the bcs state are favorable in this order . on the other hand , if we focus on the energies of cooper pairs , the bcs state , the lo state , and the normal state are favorable in this order .",
    "thus the lo state appears between the bcs state and the normal state when the magnetic field is increased @xcite .",
    "a question arises about the competition between the ab effect and the population imbalance for different spins . in the presence of these two magnetic fields ,",
    "the phase transition between the ff and lo states was reported in ref .",
    "another group suggested the existence of the half - vortex state in a similar setup of ultracold atomic gases @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that a novel phase , an angular fflo state or the so - called twisted kink ( complex kink or gray soliton ) crystal , is stabilized in which both amplitude and phase of the pair potential are spatially modulated along a superconducting ring with the ab magnetic flux penetrating the ring and the static zeeman magnetic field on the ring .",
    "we draw the phase diagram as a function of both magnetic fields by using the bdg formalism valid at temperatures much lower than the critical temperature ( including @xmath4 ) and find the twisted kink crystals to be the lowest energy states in a large region of the parameter space .",
    "we find the two kinds of first - order phase transitions ; one corresponds to phase slips separating the aharonov - bohm magnetic flux and another separates the number of peaks of the pair amplitude for the zeeman magnetic field .",
    "the twisted kink crystal in an infinite system was found in high - energy physics as a self - consistent solution of the gross - neveu model in 1 + 1 dimensions or equivalently , the bdg equation with the andreev approximation @xcite .",
    "however , only a phase modulation ( the ff state ) was found to appear in the phase diagram of the gross - neveu model in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "our work is a proposal to realize an fflo state with both phase and amplitude of the pair potential modulated .",
    "in this section , we make a brief review of the analytical solution of twisted kink crystal state and we show that the method used can be generalized in the presence of the magnetic fields .",
    "we study a quasi-1d superconducting ring under magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "[ ring ] ) by the mean - field bdg equation @xcite . here",
    ", we assume that the radius of the ring is large enough compared to its width so that the curvature effect can be ignored .",
    "although the mean - field approximation is not valid in strictly one dimension , we assume a quasi-1d system , which is more relevant to experiments and can be well described by the bdg equation for quasiparticles @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( we adopt the units @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } u(x ) \\\\",

    ", there is an odd - even phase transition . as an example , if we increase @xmath14 from @xmath123 for @xmath138 , the number of the peaks changes to 1 , 3 , 4 in the order .",

    "we have demonstrated that this fflo phase can be realized as the lowest energy state of our system instead of the half vortex state .",
    "we have shown the phase diagram as a function of the ab flux and the zeeman field .",
    "the fflo states , which enjoy an analytical description involving only a few parameters , together with the excess spin contribution result in a nontrivial phase structure .    while our phase diagram is calculated by taking the number of sites equal to 50 , we have also confirmed that the configurations remain qualitatively the same even if we increase the number of sites to 59 , 73 , and 100 for some choices of the parameters .",

    "here we briefly summarize the basic properties of the order parameters .",
    "one can derive the non linear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) from the bdg equation and the gap equation as @xmath139 all the solutions known before , including bcs , ff , lo , and the twisted kink crystal state , obey the above equation with suitable real parameters @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",

    ", the order parameter can be written as @xmath145 , with the real function @xmath146 and a constant @xmath147 .",
    "thus the nlse becomes @xmath148 the imaginary part of the above equation leads to @xmath149 this equation requires @xmath141 to be @xmath150 for the lo phase .    we can also show that if @xmath144 , the order parameter @xmath151 with real functions @xmath146 and @xmath152 must satisfy that @xmath152 is constant or @xmath153 . by substituting @xmath151 into nlse with @xmath144 , we obtain @xmath154 thus the imaginary part of the above equation requires @xmath155 or @xmath156 .",
    "the contraposition of this shows that if @xmath157 nor @xmath158 , @xmath141 must not be @xmath150 ."

    "<S> we find the angular fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states ( or the twisted kink crystals ) in which a phase and an amplitude of a pair potential modulate simultaneously in a quasi - one - dimensional superconducting ring with a static zeeman magnetic field applied on the ring and static aharonov - bohm magnetic flux penetrating the ring . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting ring with magnetic flux produces a persistent current , whereas the zeeman split of fermi energy results in the spatial modulation of the pair potential . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these two magnetic fields stabilize the fflo phase in a large parameter region of the magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we further draw the phase diagram with the two kinds of first - order phase transitions ; one corresponds to phase slips separating the aharonov - bohm magnetic flux , and the other separates the number of peaks of the pair amplitude for the zeeman magnetic field . </S>"
