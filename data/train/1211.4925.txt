    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) have attracted much attention to understand a relationship with quantum information @xcite . compared to local order parameters in the conventional landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism , in connections between quantum information and qpts , quantum entanglement , i.e. , a purely quantum correlation being absent in classical systems , can be used as an indicator of qpts driven by quantum fluctuations in quantum many - body systems@xcite . quantum fidelity , based on the basic notions of quantum mechanics on quantum measurement ,",
    "has also provided an another way to characterize qpts@xcite . in the last few years",
    ", various quantum fidelity approaches such as fidelity per lattice site ( fls)@xcite , reduced fidelity@xcite , fidelity susceptibility@xcite , density - functional fidelity@xcite , and operator fidelity@xcite , have been suggested and implemented to explore qpts .",
    "actually , the fidelity is a measure of similarity between two quantum states by defining a overlap function between them .",
    "the fact that groundstates in different phases should be orthogonal due to their distinguishability in the thermodynamic limit allows a fidelity between quantum many - body states in different phases signaling qpts because an abrupt change of the fidelity is expected across a critical point in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "thus , the fidelity has great advantages to characterize the qpts in a variety of quantum lattice systems because the groundstate of a system undergoes a drastic change in its structure at a critical point , regardless of of what type of internal orders are present in quantum many - body states .",
    "especially , the groundstate fls has been manifested to capture drastic changes of the groundstate wave functions around a critical point even for those can not be described in the framework of landau - ginzburg - wilson theory , such as a beresinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transtion and topological qpts in quantum lattice many - body systems @xcite .    even though such latest advances in understanding qpts have been made significantly , however , understanding _ directly _ degenerate groundstates originated from a spontaneous symmetry breaking as a heart of the landau - ginzburg - wilson theory has still been remained in unexplored research regimes .",
    "also , recently developed tensor network ( tn ) algorithms@xcite in quantum lattice systems have made it possible to explore directly degenerate groundstates with a randomly chosen initial state subject to an imaginary time evolution .",

    "further , in the quantum three - state potts model @xcite , a three - fold degenerate groundstate has been detected by using a bifurcation of fls and a probability mass distribution function .",
    "when the system has more than three - fold degenerate groundstates , the degenerate groundstates are orthogonal one another in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a quantum fidelity defined by a overlap function between degenerate groundstates may not distinguish all the degenerate groundstates properly .",
    "then , in this paper , we investigate how to detect generally @xmath2-fold degenerate groundstates calculated from a tensor network algorithm . to do this ,",
    "we introduce a quantum fidelity between degenerate groundstates and an arbitrary reference state .",
    "the quantum fidelity corresponds to a projection of each groundstate onto the chosen reference state .",
    "straightforwardly , for a broken symmetry phase , the number of different projection magnitudes denotes the groundstate degeneracy . at a critical point",
    ", the different projection magnitudes collapse to one projection magnitude .",
    "in such a property of the defined quantum fidelity , the different projection magnitudes of the groundstates can be called as multiple bifurcation of the quantum fidelity .",
    "a multiple bifurcation point is identified to be a critical point .    as a prototypical example",
    ", we explore the groundstate wavefunctions in the @xmath0-state potts model@xcite in transverse magnetic fields . by employing the infinite matrix product state ( imps ) with the time evolving block decimation ( itebd ) method @xcite ,",

    ", the @xmath0-fold degenerate groundstates in the broken symmetry phase are obtained by means of the quantum fidelity with @xmath0 branches .",
    "a continuous ( discontinuous ) qpt for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) has been manifested by a continues ( discontinuous ) fidelity function across the critical point .",
    "the multiple bifurcation points are shown to correspond to the critical points .",
    "also , we discuss a multiple bifurcation of local order parameters and its characteristic properties for the broken symmetry phase . we find a general relation between the order parameters from each of degenerate groundstates .",
    "the general relation shows clearly how the order parameters from each of the degenerate groundstates transform under the subgroup of the symmetry group @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath5 , we calculate the critical exponents agree well with their exact values . from the finite - entanglement scalings of the von neumann entropy and the correlation length ,",
    "the cental charges are calculated to classify the universal classes for each @xmath0-state potts model .",
