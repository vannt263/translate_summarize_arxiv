    "the absence of additional charge - carrying sectors of the theory , such as extremal black holes , suggests that electron stars are a promising arena to investigate the nature of strongly interacting fermi surfaces . in this letter",
    "we will probe two key features of fermi surfaces : their manifestation as quantum oscillations in a magnetic field and the luttinger theorem relating the area of the fermi surface to the total charge density @xcite .",
    "one of our main results will be that while the system exhibits the classic kosevich - lifshitz quantum oscillations characteristic of fermi liquids , the corresponding fermi surface area does not satisfy the luttinger theorem . while a direct comparison is premature , it is noteworthy that this same apparent dichotomy between fermi liquid oscillations and non - fermi liquid physics has haunted much recent discussion in the cuprates following the seminal experiments of @xcite .",
    "the geometry behind the mismatch in our holographic setup will become apparent : many of the bulk fermions do not participate in the oscillations and therefore disrupt the ` luttinger count ' . in the final section",

    "we proceed to a dual field theory characterisation of the fermionic physics of the intermediate region , geometrically associated with the field theory energy scale @xmath46 .",
    "a density of fermions leads to robust characteristic features in the magnetic field dependence of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "expanding in small momenta about a point @xmath47 on the fermi surface of a fermi liquid leads to the green s function [ eq : gfl ] g^-1_(,k ) = - i + v^k_+ . here",
    "@xmath48 is the euclidean frequency measured relative to the chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "the constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ( locally defined on the fermi surface ) fermi velocity and effective electron mass . the momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the components of the momentum in directions perpendicular and parallel to the fermi surface at the point @xmath47 .",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ eq : gfl ] ) about a fermi surface leads to de haas - van alphen quantum oscillations in the magnetic susceptibility . restricting for simplicity to a circular fermi surface",
    ", the leading oscillation in the susceptibility per unit area is given by the kosevich - lifshitz formula @xcite [ eq : kl ] _",
    "@xmath41 is the temperature , @xmath53 the magnetic field and @xmath54 is the area of the fermi surface .",
    "the fermi momentum @xmath55 .",
    "thus from a measurement of the susceptibility one can determine the two coefficients in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : gfl ] ) .    we will now search for an oscillatory magnetic susceptibility of our electron stars .",
    "adding fully fledged magnetic fields and temperature dependence is involved and will not be considered here .",
    "instead , we will work in a regime where in our field theory @xmath56 .",
    "this is typically the experimentally relevant regime . in this limit",
    "we can ignore the backreaction of temperature and magnetic field on the spacetime geometry as only the very near horizon region will be affected .",
    "thus we keep the radial profiles of the functions @xmath22 satisfying the equations of the previous section and obtained numerically in @xcite .",
    "the crucial consequence of the magnetic field is to collapse the local fermion spectrum into landau levels labelled by @xmath57 .",
    "while @xmath53 is taken small , @xmath58 must be kept finite .",
    "the splitting of the spectrum leads to non - analyticities in the magnetic field dependence that are then smeared out by the temperature  the competition between these two effects leads to the formula ( [ eq : kl ] ) in a fermi liquid .",
    "thus to leading order at low temperatures and magnetic fields we can use the expression for the free energy density from @xcite = - q = - _ r_s^ ( s ) ds .",
    "this formula simply expresses the charge density of the dual field theory as an integral over the charge density in the electron star . in the presence of a small magnetic field and temperature , the local charge density @xmath13 in ( [ eq : flat ] ) must now be written as ( we drop from the outset the contribution of antiparticles , these do not see the fermi surface and hence do not contribute to quantum oscillations ) [ eq : sb ] = _ -^dp _ , where @xmath59 .",
    "we have dropped a factor of @xmath60 that appears in the @xmath61 term .",
    "the local temperature and magnetic field are related to the rescaled temperature and magnetic field of the dual field theory via [ eq : bt ] b_(r ) = = r^2 b , t_(r ) = = .",
    "the first of these relations used the fact that in the absence of magnetic sources the magnetic flux @xmath62 is constant . in the next few equations we drop the ` loc . ' subscript on @xmath63 and @xmath53 for clarity of expression .",
    "a finite temperature affects electron stars in two ways .",
    "it leads to fermi - dirac terms in the sum over states as in ( [ eq : sb ] ) and also results in the appearance of a black hole in the interior of the geometry .",
    "the black hole is classical in the bulk and thereby captures the leading finite temperature physics whereas the effects of hawking radiation , which is responsible for exciting the fermion fluid , are suppressed in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "changes in the local geometry , however , are insufficient to smooth out the quantum oscillations and therefore the expression ( [ eq : sb ] ) contains the leading effects of temperature for our purposes .    while performing the sums in ( [ eq : sb ] ) is a standard computation , we will outline the method used in @xcite which extracts the oscillating part efficiently and transparently . we first perform a poisson resummation of the sum over landau levels = _ k _ 0^ d _ -^+ dp . we then proceed to change integration variables from @xmath64 to the energy @xmath65 and also to decompose the fermi - dirac distribution into a sum over matsubara frequencies ( the latter involves adding a @xmath3-independent term that will be cancelled by the antiparticle contribution ) .",
    "thus = - _ k , n _",
    "-^+ dp _ ^ de e .",
    "the integral over @xmath65 is performed by deforming the integration contour in such a way that the argument of the exponential is always real and decreasing at large energies .",
    "the only obstruction to doing this is the pole coming from the matsubara frequencies .",
    "this obstruction is only present if @xmath66 and furthermore @xmath67 for @xmath68 or @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the rotated contour integral is manifestly non oscillating in @xmath53 .",
    "the only oscillating contribution comes from the poles and is given to leading order in @xmath71 by _ = 2 t _",

    "[ eq : final ] the expression ( [ eq : final ] ) can now be plugged into the formula ( [ eq : sb ] ) for the free energy of the boundary field theory .",
    "so long as the local fermi surface area proportional to @xmath72 is not small , i.e. so long as we are not at the boundary of the electron star , then the fact that @xmath73 allows us to perform a saddle point evaluation of the integral over radial position @xmath74 in ( [ eq : sb ] ) .",
    "because @xmath75 , the imaginary exponent in ( [ eq : final ] ) in the more rapidly varying one .",
    "after taking the saddle point we restrict to the first harmonic @xmath76 as higher modes are suppressed and then perform the sum over the matsubara frequencies @xmath77 . because @xmath78 , the @xmath11 integral in ( [ eq : final ] ) can be performed over the whole real line . the final result for",
    "the oscillatory free energy density is the kosevich - lifshitz form [ eq : klstar ] _ = , where we have expressed everything in terms of rescaled boundary field theory quantities .",
    "comparing with ( [ eq : kl ] ) , the effective fermi surface area is [ eq : af ] a_f = _ r , with @xmath79 being the radius at which the maximum is attained , and the effective fermion mass [ eq : mstar ] m^= .    because the numerator , the local fermi surface area , increases monotonically from zero at the boundary of the star to a constant in the interior , while the denominator is constant on the star boundary and diverges towards the interior @xmath80 .",
    "the physical reason the denominator appears is that the conserved magnetic flux is fixed at the boundary of spacetime and becomes concentrated towards the interior according to ( [ eq : bt ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath79 is shown in figure [ fig : radii ] below for various values of the parameters @xmath81 , using the numerical methods of @xcite .",
    "the fact that low energy physics is captured at a bulk radius of order @xmath3 rather than @xmath82 may indicate that the usual holographic ir / uv correspondence is complicated in the presence of a fermi surface , analogously to the modified rg flow in field theory @xcite .",
    "is the interior of the star . from top to bottom",
    ", curves have @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we are characterising the solutions by their ir scaling exponent @xmath6 rather than @xmath31 .",
    "[ fig : radii ] ]    the previous three equations are the first important result in this paper .",
    "we have shown that upon applying a small magnetic field at low temperatures , our strongly interacting field theory at finite density exhibits quantum oscillations with a kosevich - lifshitz form ( [ eq : klstar ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we found that the fermi surface area and effective quasiparticle mass defined through these oscillations are determined by the properties of the electron star at a unique radius @xmath79 .",
    "the fact that only an extremal orbit in the fermi surface contributes is of course familar @xcite . )",
    "at which the landau level is last occupied . ]",
    "the novelty in our setup is that the surface is extremal in real space rather than momentum space and that the spatial direction in question is not part of the field theory itself , but rather the emergent dimension characteristic of holographic duality .",
    "the general relativistic physics of the extra dimension manifests itself in e.g. the appearance of the metric function @xmath85 in ( [ eq : mstar ] ) : the effective mass and fermi surface area are not related to each other as for free electrons with a chemical potential @xmath3 , there is a gravitational redshift in the effective mass due to the fact that it is defined at a fixed radius in the bulk .",
    "the dependence of @xmath86 and @xmath87 on the parameters of the model @xmath81 can be computed using the numerical techniques of @xcite and are shown in figure [ fig : ratios ] below .",
    "it is important to plot dimensionless quantities and rescale by factors of @xmath28 in ( [ eq : rn ] ) to ensure that theories are compared with the same time coordinate .    .",
    "from left to right , curves have @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "[ fig : ratios],title=\"fig : \" ] . from left to right , curves have @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "[ fig : ratios],title=\"fig : \" ]    the left hand curve shows the fermi surface area divided by the charge density .",
    "this is a dimensionless quantity without any factors of the speed of light . restoring couplings @xmath88 .",
    "although somewhat dependent on the convention for charge normalisation , this is consistent with the general holographic intuition that the field theory is in a ` large @xmath0 ' limit , so that there many species of fermion and hence a large charge density with a fixed fermi surface area .",
    "we call this quantity the ` luttinger ratio ' as for a fermi liquid the luttinger theorem states that it is constant independently of the strength of interactions in the microscopic theory @xcite .",
    "the important conclusion of the left plot in figure [ fig : ratios ] is that the luttinger theorem does not hold for these systems , despite the fact that the quantum oscillations obey a kosevich - lifshitz form . in the plot",
    "we have varied the uv dimension of the charged operator , via @xmath20 , and a ratio of the current and energy momentum central charges , via @xmath31 , see below ( [ eq : condition ] ) above , keeping the charge of the fermionic operator constant .",
    "one might worry whether the normalisation of the charge operator should be changed simultaneously in a such a way that the luttinger theorem holds .",
    "however , we will now explain the physics behind the violation of the luttinger theorem in electron stars and their dual field theories .",
    "from the bulk perspective it is clear what is going on . in the bulk",
    "we have a fermi surface in a 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime . because the spacetime is not homogeneous , the fermi surface is not uniform in position space . as is well known @xcite and as we noted above , quantum oscillations are only sensitive to extremal cross sections of the fermi surface .",
    "if a 3 + 1 dimensional fermi surface is not simply a sphere in momentum space , then the area of the fermi surface measured by quantum oscillations does not contain enough information to deduce the full volume of the fermi surface .",
    "this is manifestly what is happening in our bulk setup : only fermions at an extremal radius are contributing to quantum oscillations .",
    "hence the resulting fermi surface area can not determine the full volume of the bulk fermi surface , which would need to be integrated over all radii .",
    "in our fluid limit the luttinger theorem does hold locally at each radius . therefore integrating the total fermi volume over all radii",
    "would indeed reproduce the total charge density as required by the luttinger theorem .    from the perspective of the dual strongly interacting field theory",
    "the interpretation is much more interesting .",
    "the dual field theory is 2 + 1 dimensional and spatially homogeneous .",
    "therefore any fermi surface will be a circle in momentum space and quantum oscillations should provide a unique definition of the area of this fermi surface .",
    "the question becomes , in the spirit of @xcite , what low energy degrees of freedom are not captured by the quantum oscillations and are thereby responsible for violating the ` luttinger count ' ?",
    "the bulk fermion field we have discussed so far corresponds to a ` single trace ' fermionic operator @xmath89 in the dual field theory . in our ` large @xmath0 ' limit , single trace operators have correlators that factorise despite the fact that they do not obey linear wave equations .",
    "thus if we decompose the operator into energy and momentum modes [ eq : modes ] ( x ) = ( c_,k e^- i t + i k x + c_,k^e^i t - i k x ) , then we can expect a useful description in terms of the creation operators @xmath90 .",
    "essentially the same decomposition is considered in @xcite .",
    "whereas those papers work on a spatial sphere and use the state - operator correspondence , we are using the existence of a fock space at large @xmath0 . unlike for free fields , however , we should not expect that only operators with a simple field theoretic ` on shell ' relation between @xmath48 and @xmath91 contribute to physical quantities .",
    "rather the on shell condition is that of the higher dimensional bulk theory [ eq : gauss ] g^tt(r ) ^2 + g^xx(r ) k^2 + g^rr(r ) k_r^2 = m^2 .",
    "this shows that for a given field theory momentum @xmath91 , fermions with a range of @xmath48 will be important .",
    "we can subsume the two bulk labels @xmath92 and @xmath18 into a single label , the effective mass @xmath93 of the field theoretic fermion . on shell fermions will then have _",
    "k(m ) = . in the limit in which we are working ,",
    "bulk interactions are such that fermions modify the background geometry , but the fermions still satisfy the gaussian dispersion ( [ eq : gauss ] ) .",
    "we can now imagine integrating out all degrees of freedom except for the charge - carrying fermionic field @xmath89 .",
    "the effective action that captures the fermionic ground state of the theory is then given by a continuum of modes labelled by their mass @xmath93 [ eq : heff ] h _ = dm a(m ) d^2k ( _ k(m ) - ) c_k^(m ) c_k(m ) , where in terms of the modes ( [ eq : modes ] ) of the operator @xmath89 c_k(m ) = c__k(m),k .",
    "the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the action are determined in the process of integrating out the other fields . in the dual bulk description",
    "this amounts to solving the einstein - maxwell - fluid equations as was done in @xcite . the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    "can then be read off from the distribution of the fermion fluid in the bulk radial direction and the background spacetime geometry .",
    "the effects of the emergent ir scaling are contained in these functions . because the single operator @xmath89 does not lead to a single fermionic excitation but rather a continuum thereof",
    ", we might refer to the @xmath96 excitations of ( [ eq : heff ] ) as ` smeared ' fermions .",
    "given the action ( [ eq : heff ] ) , it is clear that the luttinger count and quantum oscillations are reconciled in the same way as in the bulk description .",
    "the fermi surface is labelled by both @xmath93 and the momentum . only fermions that are at an extremal cross section in this total space contribute to quantum oscillations .",
    "said differently , there is a continuum of landau levels with an energy depending on @xmath93 .",
    "these form ` landau bands ' .",
    "oscillations are due only to electrons at the extrema of the landau bands .",
    "all of the fermions however contribute to the total charge density .",
    "previous methods of violating the luttinger theorem involve topological order , in which fractionalised excitations carry off part of the uv electronic charge density @xcite .",
    "integrating out these excitations may lead to a structure similar to the effective smeared action ( [ eq : heff ] ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to develop parallels .",
    "the holographic setup has the virtue that the smeared spectral weight can be described by ( dually ) free stable excitations .    the effective action ( [ eq : heff ] ) for the fermions does not capture all of the interesting low energy physics . in particular , the dynamical critical exponent @xmath6 in the ir can be thought of as being due to landau damping of the massless gauge fields of the uv quantum field theory by the ground state density of fermions .",
