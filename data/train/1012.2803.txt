    "symbiotic stars are interpreted as interacting binaries consisting of a cool visual primary and a hot compact secondary component accreting matter from the atmosphere of its companion .",
    "their spectral variability is determined from the orbital motion and the outburst events of the hot component .",
    "these events are often accompanied by intensive loss of mass in the form of optically thick shells , stellar wind outflow and bipolar collimated jets .",
    "the stellar wind is possible to be bipolar and highly collimated too .",
    "the ejected material forms complicated flow structure in the space between the components , whose elements determine the observed properties of the star .",
    "the interacting binary z and is considered as a prototype of the classical symbiotic stars .",
    "it consists of a normal cool giant of spectral type m4.5 @xcite , a hot compact component with a temperature of about @xmath0 k @xcite and an extended circumbinary nebula formed by the winds of the stellar components and partly photoionized by the compact object .",
    "z and has undergone several active phases consisting of repeated optical brightenings with amplitudes up to @xmath1@xmath2 mag and characterized by intensive loss of mass @xcite .",
    "the last active phase of z and began at the end of august 2000 @xcite and continued up to that time including six optical brightenings .",
    "the maxima of the light during the active phase were in december 2000 ( @xmath38 ) , november 2002 ( @xmath48 ) , september 2004 ( @xmath41 ) , july 2006 ( @xmath56 ) , january 2008 ( @xmath65 ) and january 2010 ( @xmath54 ) @xcite ( we also used data of the american association of variable star observers , aavso , and via private communication from a.  skopal ) .",
    "high resolution optical data indicating highly different physical conditions ( velocity , density , temperature ) in the line emission regions were obtained during this active phase @xcite .",
    "the current study is based on observations acquired during the first and fourth outbursts .",
    "the main features of the flow structure in the system during the active phase indicated by our data can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we suppose that an accretion disk is present in the system . only in this way we can explain the presence of the @xmath74686 line in the spectrum and its behavior during the first outburst @xcite .",
    "stellar wind was observed in the system during all the outbursts .",
    "two wind components with different velocity regimes were observed simultaneously ",
    "wind propagating at a moderate velocity , @xmath8@xmath9 @xcite , and wind with a high velocity , in excess of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "bipolar collimated outflow appeared during the fourth outburst . in the beginning of july 2006",
    "the h@xmath11 line had an absorption component shifted by @xmath12 from its center .",
    "it went into emission and later , in july ",
    "december 2006 , the spectrum contained additional emission components on either side of the central peak corresponding to velocities of @xmath13@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath15 line had the same features @xcite .",
    "both the emission and absorption high - velocity components are assumed to be formed in a bipolar collimated outflow @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the current study is to suggest a model for the flow structure in the system to explain all of these features .",
    "we believe that it will be helpful in explaining not only the data acquired during this active phase , but also all spectroscopic data taken during earlier phases , those following 1939 , 1960 and 1984 and possibly the activity of other classical symbiotic stars .",
    "according to the theoretical models @xcite an accretion disk is formed around the compact object in the z  and system when the wind of its giant has quiescent parameters .",
    "the radius of the disk is about 50@xmath16 for a wind velocity of 2025 and thus the outer part of the disk is optically thin .",
    "the mass of the disk is estimated as product of one quarter of the mass - loss rate of the giant @xmath17 yr@xmath18 @xcite , and the typical time interval between the active phases  about 10 years .",
    "based on the size and the mass of the disk of @xmath19 we can assume that its inner region is optically thick in the quiescent state of the system .    to change the system from quiescent to active state a sufficiently large increase of the accretion rate",
    "is needed .",
    "accretion of a considerable fraction of the disk s mass is required in order for an outburst to develop even in the combined model where the increased nuclear burning rate is taken into account @xcite .",
    "maximal increase of the accretion rate is possible in the framework of the mechanism proposed by @xcite and @xcite . according to this mechanism , even a small increase of the velocity of the wind of the donor is sufficient to change the accretion regime . during the transition from disk accretion to accretion from the flow ,",
    "the disk is partially disrupted and the increased velocity of the wind causes falling of the material of the disk onto the accretor s surface .",
    "however , even in this case a considerable amount of mass ( up to @xmath20@xmath21 per cent ) stays in the disk .",
    "then massive accretion disk exists in the system during the active phase too .        during the outburst the high velocity wind of the hot compact component collides with the accretion disk ,",
    "its velocity decreases near the orbital plane but does not change at higher stellar latitude .",
    "a consequence of this is that two different kinds of stellar wind are observed ",
    "p  cyg wind with a low velocity and an optically thin high velocity wind . as a result of the collision",
    "the density of the wind close to the orbital plane increases and the level of the observed photosphere locates at a larger distance from the star .",
    "thus , an optically thick disk - like shell forms , which occults the compact object . since its effective",
    "temperature is lower it is responsible for the continuum energy redistribution and the increase of the optical flux of the star .",
    "the interaction of the wind with the disk is equivalent to interaction of two winds and thus can form shocked region of collisional ionization with temperature of up to @xmath22 k ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite .    during the active phase the wind from the hot component `` strips '' the accretion disk carrying some part of its material in the circumbinary envelope . after each outburst",
    "some part of this material does not leave the potential well and after the cessation of the wind begins to accrete again . because of the initial amount of angular momentum a disk - like envelope extending to larger distance from the orbital plane than the accretion disk itself forms ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the existence of a centrifugal barrier creates hollow cones around the axis of rotation with small opening angle @xcite .",
    "the disk - like envelope does not exist during the first outburst of the active phase . during the recurrent outbursts the extended disk - like envelope can collimate the wind which escapes the compact object predominantly via the two hollow cones ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the bipolar outflow can be observed as high - velocity satellite components situated on either side of the mean peak of the line .",
    "their presence in the spectrum depends on the density of the disk - like envelope ( i.e. on the system s activity during its previous phases ) and on the wind intensity .",
    "they can appear only if the density of the disk - like envelope is sufficient to provide collimation and the mass - loss rate of the compact component is high enough .",
    "according to our model these spectral features can be observed during outbursts accompanied by loss of mass at high rate and preceded by similar strong outbursts .    according to the current theory the existence of bipolar collimated jets",
    "is supposed to be due to presence in the system of magnetized disk which transforms the potential energy of the accreting material into kinetic energy of the outflowing jets .",
    "this means that accretion must be realized to provide existence of the jets . in the spectrum of z  and during its 2006 outburst , however , different indications of stellar wind presented along with satellite emission components . if we believe that `` traditional '' jets were observed , it is necessary to explain accretion onto the star at the time when a strong mass outflow from its surface was observed . on the other hand , the proposed model of collimated stellar wind",
    "makes it possible to explain all features of the observed spectrum without any important contradictions .",
    "another question related to the nature of the collimated outflow is that about the orbit inclination .",
    "the velocity of the radiatively accelerated wind can not exceed @xmath23 .",
    "the highest observed outflow velocity during the 2006 outburst was @xmath14 .",
    "a preliminary analysis of our spectra obtained during late december 2009 showed velocities of @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "taking into account these velocities we obtain an upper limit of the orbit inclination of about @xmath26 .",
    "that is why the view about the nature of the outflow can shed some light on the question about the orbit inclination .",
    "we suppose that the model suggested by us can be used to explain the behavior of the line spectrum of other classical symbiotic stars during their active phases too since the classical symbiotic stars have the next general characteristics :    1 .",
    "the mass transfer in the majority of the classical symbiotic stars is realized by means of the stellar wind of the giant .",
    "the theoretical computations of @xcite and @xcite show that for systems with parameters close to those of z  and an accretion disk from wind accretion forms around the compact object .",
    "the accretion disk prevents the outflowing material during the active phase and outflow with two - component velocity regime forms .",
    "the systems with parameters close to z  and have similar accretion rate of their compact object .",
    "the accretion rate determines the regime of hydrogen burning .",
    "the view that hydrogen burns in a steady state in the classical symbiotic stars is commonly accepted .",
    "when the accretion rate goes above the upper limit of the steady burning range the white dwarf expands which is observed as optical outburst with typical duration of one year .",
    "the first outburst opening the active phase can be followed by repeated outbursts . during the repeated outbursts an extended envelope surrounding the accretion disk exists in the system and it can be responsible for the collimation of the stellar wind .",
    "according to our model a geometrically thin accretion disk exists in the system in the beginning of the first outburst and the inner region of this disk can be optically thick .",
    "the presence of a moderate - velocity wind is indicated by the p  cyg profiles of the triplet @xmath27 and @xmath28 lines during the light maximum .",

    "the position of the dip corresponded to the red absorption component of the p cyg lines of ( fig .",
    "the low velocity of the p  cyg absorption and the dip in the h@xmath30 emission profile can be explained with supposition for decrease of the velocity of the wind of the compact component after its collision with the disk ( fig .",

    "assuming that the broad component ( like the broad component of the @xmath31 line ) is emitted by an optically thin high - velocity wind from the compact object , this can be explained with absorption in the stellar wind which is responsible for the p  cyg profiles .    in the quiescent state",
    "an additional emission component was present on the short - wavelenghts side of the h@xmath30 line forming a shoulder in its profile .",

    "two emission components on either side of the central peak were formed in july .",
    "the disappearance of the blue - shifted absorption component and the appearance of emission are probably due to a decrease of the mass - loss rate and/or an increase of the number of emitting atoms in the region of the wind that does not project onto the stellar disk .",

    "@xcite concluded that the h@xmath11 wings during the outburst state were formed in a high - velocity stellar wind from the compact component .",

    "the equivalent width of the broad component was obtained with an error of 10 per cent depending mainly on the level of the local continuum .",
