    "effective field theories are a very useful tool , both in statistical mechanics and in particle physics.@xcite the basic idea is to construct an `` effective '' theory , valid at large length scales and long times , which contains only those degrees that are important in this regime , while all others have been integrated out . since the effective theory is simpler than the underlying fundamental theory that contains all degrees of freedom explicitly , it is easier to solve .",
    "if the fundamental theory is known , as is the case in condensed matter physics , effective theories can be derived from it .",
    "if it is not known , as in particle physics , the effective theory can be guessed with feedback from experiments . in either case",
    "the effective theory in general contains features that are not present in the fundamental or microscopic theory .",
    "for instance , interaction events between particles that are sequential occurences of fundamental interactions on microscopic scales will appear as basic interactions on the coarse - grained length and time scales of the effective theory .",
    "an example from particle physics is the fermi theory of beta decay , which assumed a point - like interaction between the particles involved.@xcite later , in more microscopic theories of the weak interaction , it became clear that there is internal structure in fermi s interaction related to the exchange of gauge bosons.@xcite    in condensed matter physics , the only interaction in the microscopic theory is the coulomb interaction .",
    "we will be concerned with electron - electron interactions in disordered metals , and therefore we take the `` fundamental '' interaction to be the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "let us consider processes in which two electrons interact at some point in space and time , and some time later a third electron interacts with one of the two some distance away from the first interaction point .",
    "in an effective theory that has integrated out the behavior at short length and time scales , such a process will appear as a `` fundamental '' interaction between _ three _ electrons , since the effective theory can no longer resolve the individual microscopic interaction processes .",
    "in classical statistical mechanics the importance of such effective many - body interactions is well known .",
    "an example is the expansion of transport coefficients in powers of the particle number density . to obtain the contribution at",
    "any given ( sufficiently high ) order in the density one needs to consider collisions between arbitrarily many particles.@xcite analogous effects have been considered for many - electron systems,@xcite although the connection with effective many - body interactions was not made explicit . furthermore , the construction of a complete effective theory requires that any many - body interactions that are generated in perturbation theory be included in further iterations of the renormalization process that integrates out the short - range degrees of freedom .",
    "this has never been done ; existing effective theories for disordered many - electron systems contain two - body interactions only.@xcite    in the present paper , we show explicitly that many - body interactions in such systems are generated under renormalization .",
    "the many - body interactions generated are of long range in space and time due to the diffusive electron dynamics . as a consequence of their long - range nature ,",
    "the naive renormalization - group ( rg ) scale dimensions of these terms vanish in two - dimensions , which implies that they should be important in theories of the anderson - mott metal - insulator transition near two - dimensions.@xcite we will clarify in what sense this is the case .",
    "we will further show that these many - body interactions can lead to qualitatively new scaling behavior if the interactions are strong enough .",

    "let us consider an ensemble of interacting electrons in the presence of quenched disorder . for simplicity , we will model the screened coulomb interaction by an instantaneous , point - like model interaction whose coupling constant we denote by @xmath1 .",

    "[ sec : iii ] .",
    "this observation justifies our using a point - like three - body interaction amplitude despite the fact that the one generated in perturbation theory was long - ranged . in the appendix",
    "we discuss a similar feature of @xmath0-theory .",
    "we conclude that the many - body interactions are indeed important for weak - coupling fixed points , as one would have expected . however , since they do not lead to new marginal ( in @xmath85 ) scaling operators , the relevant physics is already contained in the renormalization of the two - body interaction constants .",
    "weak - coupling fixed points will thus always be perturbatively stable with respect to @xmath76 , and also with respect to higher many - body interactions , i.e. , they have a finite basin of attraction .",
    "this in turn implies that the coupling of @xmath76 to the other coupling constants can not change the critical behavior , it will merely lead to power - law corrections to scaling . in particular ,",
    "all of the perturbative metal - insulator transition fixed points that are known to exist for the generalized nonlinear sigma - model defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] are stable with respect to @xmath76 .",
    "let us now consider strong - coupling fixed points , where the ratio of successive terms in the loop expansion is not necessarily some power of @xmath95 .",
    "this can happen if the fixed point value of @xmath88 is large , of @xmath96 , or infinite , even if @xmath72 is still of @xmath86 .",
    "of course , another possibility is that @xmath97 .",
    "no controlled theories exist of metal - insulator transitions that are governed by such fixed points , but they are structurally clearly possible .",
    "explicit , if uncontrolled , examples of fixed points where both @xmath72 and an interaction coupling constant are of @xmath89 have been given in refs .   and .",
    "it is also believed that strong - coupling physics governs the behavior in certain @xmath98-@xmath64 sytems , where the interaction strength may be the dominant energy scale in the problem.@xcite    the arguments in the previous subsection that ensure the irrelevance of @xmath76 obviously break down for such strong - coupling fixed points .",
    "we stress that this may be true even if the fixed - point value of @xmath72 is still small .",
    "the point is that with , e.g. , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and hence the one - loop term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.2e ] ) can overwhelm the bare scale dimension of @xmath76 .",
    "the same arguments hold for the higher many - body interaction terms , although to a lesser degree , since for them a larger negative bare scale dimension must be overcome in order to make them relevant .",
    "we conclude that the many - body interaction terms can not be dismissed _ a priori _ in any strong - coupling regime , where the dimensionless interaction amplitudes are large , even if the disorder is still small .",
    "in particular , they are likely to play a role in the resolution of the two - dimensional metal - insulator transition problem .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that many - body interactions are generated under renormalization of an action for interacting disordered electrons that contains two - body interactions only .",
    "such interactions turn out to be irrelevant with respect to the perturbative fixed points that describe metal - insulator transitions in @xmath66 .",
    "however , they need to be examinated , and they likely contribute to the leading behavior , in any strong - coupling theory .",
    "this implies in particular that even if strong - coupling solutions for the generalized nonlinear sigma - model with two - body interactions could be found , such solutions would be incomplete , and probably physically wrong .",
    "the task of determining the strong - coupling behavior of such systems , and in particular the situation in @xmath85 , is thus even harder than previously assumed .",
    "we conclude by recapitulating two aspects of our technical development that can easily lead to confusion .",
    "first of all , let us come back to the infrared divergence of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.11b ] ) . naively , this infrared divergence seems to offset the extra factor of temperature compared to the two - body interaction , making the three - body interaction marginal by power counting in @xmath85 .",
    "the same argument applies to higher many - body interaction amplitudes , which carry additional factors of temperature , but come with even more divergent loop integrals . as we show explicitly by analyzing an analogous effect in @xmath0-theory in the appendix ,",
    "this simple argument is fallacious and the many - body interactions are perturbatively irrelevant , but they are likely to play an important role in nonperturbative regimes .",
    "second , we have focussed on one particular three - body interaction term , namely , a spin - singlet three - body interaction . for this term",
    ", we have calculated _ all _ contributions to second order in the spin - singlet two - body interaction within a well - defined model .",
    "this proves the existence of many - body interactions in effective field theories for electrons , but our calculation is sensitive to only a small subclass of such terms .",
    "many - body interactions coupling four and more electrons , spin - triplet interactions , and terms coupling singlet and triplet density fluctuations certainly exist , and they all need to be examined in order to systematically deal with strong - coupling effects .    finally , we note that existing theories of the anderson - mott transition seem to lead to the conclusion that it is very similar to an anderson transition . however , it is reasonable to assume that in strongly correlated systems the metal - insulator transition should more closely resemble a mott transition.@xcite this suggests the existence of a saddle in parameter space separating the fixed points that describe the two transitions .",
    "the disordered mott transition is likely described by a strong - coupling fixed point .",
    "as discussed after eqs .",
    "( [ eqs:4.2 ] ) , on the strong - coupling side of such a saddle the many - particle interactions are likely to be important , even if the weak - coupling anderson or anderson - mott fixed point is locally stable with respect to them . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that a landau theory for the anderson - mott transition in high dimensions ( @xmath102)@xcite found indeed that for weak interactions , an anderson transition takes place with increasing disorder , while for strong interactions the metal - insulator transition has a different nature .",
    "it is likely that the many - body interactions discussed in this paper are important for understanding the missing link between this theory in high dimensions , and the usual treatment of the metal - insulator transition problem near two - dimensions .",
    "we would like to thank john toner for an enlightening discussion .",
    "this work was supported by the nsf under grant nos .",
    "dmr-01 - 32555 , and dmr-01 - 32726 .",
    "in this appendix we recall some aspects of @xmath0-theory that are analogous to the generation of many - body interactions discussed in the main part of the paper .",
    "see refs .   for a derivation of the results summarized below",
    ".    consider scalar @xmath0-theory , with an action s [ ] = - dx  ( x)[r - ^2 ] ( x ) - dx  ^4(x ) .",
    "[ eq : a.1 ] upon renormalization , a @xmath103-term with a coupling constant @xmath104 is generated by means of the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "this diagram represents a momentum integral over three propagators . in perturbation theory , and at criticality , this integral is strongly infrared divergent .",
    "naively , this raises the question whether @xmath104 can really be irrelevant with respect to the wilson - fisher fixed point . to investigate this",
    ", we consider the rg flow equations . adding a @xmath103-term to the action , one easily finds , within a momentum - shell rg , and to one - loop order , [ eqs : a.2 ] & = & 2r + , [ eq : a.2a ] + & = & u_4 - + , [ eq : a.2b ] + & = & -2(1-)u_6 - + , [ eq : a.2c ] where @xmath105 .",
    "linearization of these flow equations about the wilson - fisher fixed point @xmath106 yields three rg eigenvalues [ eqs : a.3 ] _ 1 & = & 2 - /3 + o(^2 ) , [ eq : a.3a ] + _ 2 & = & -+ o(^2 ) , [ eq : a.3b ] + _ 3 & = & -2 - 3 + o(^2 ) .",
    "[ eq : a.3c ] @xmath107 is the inverse correlation length exponent , @xmath108 is the scale dimension of the least irrelevant operator , and @xmath109 is irrelevant even for @xmath110 .",
    "the infrared properties of the triangle diagram thus do not lead to another ( besides @xmath108 ) eigenvalue of @xmath86 .",
    "this is true even though it does lead to a leading scaling behavior of @xmath104 that is given by @xmath111 , as can be seen by solving the flow equations .",
    "however , this just means that @xmath104 is not a proper scaling operator , since it couples to @xmath112 . with @xmath113 and @xmath114 ,",
    "the proper next - to - least irrelevant scaling operator is @xmath115 .",
    "its scale dimension is @xmath116 = \\lambda_3 $ ] , so @xmath117 is indeed irrelevant with scale dimension @xmath118 in @xmath119 .",
    "this phenomemon of the generation of a new operator that is irrelevant with respect to the perturbative fixed point in @xmath120 is completely analogous to the irrelevance of the three - body interaction with respect to the perturbative metal - insulator transition fixed points in @xmath66 , and the analogy extends to the long - rangedness of the new interaction .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that there is no general _ a priori _ guarantee that @xmath117 will no be relevant in , say , @xmath121 .",
    "indeed , the bare scale dimension of @xmath104 is @xmath122 , which naively implies a marginal operator in @xmath121 .",
    "the one - loop correction switches the sign of the @xmath86 correction , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : a.3c ] ) , so the one - loop approximation to @xmath123 makes @xmath117 more irrelevant with increasing @xmath95 , not less .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that , ( 1 ) this change of sign is a special property of @xmath0-theory , which can be seen only by means of an explicit calculation , and , ( 2 ) there is no guarantee that high - order terms in the @xmath95-expansion will not have a positive sign and make @xmath109 positive in @xmath121 . in @xmath0-theory there are no indications that this is the case , but it could happen in a different , more complicated field theory ."
