    "there has recently been some concern raised over the possibility that the slope of cepheid period - luminosity ( @xmath2 ) relation is not universal .",
    "ngeow et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , kanbur et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , koen & siluyele ( 2007 ) and other studies cited therein suggest that the optical @xmath2 relation shows a break around ten days . these results are controversial and are still being debated in the literature ( see for instance benedict et al .",
    "2008 , and pietrzynski et al .",
    "2007 ) . given the impact that cepheids have traditionally had on the determination of distances to galaxies it is important to confirm the effect , quantify it , and then if it proves to be real , fully assess the impact of it .",
    "however , it is not the purpose of this short contribution to attempt that assessment , rather we wish to show explicitly that the reddening - free form of the period - luminosity relation , the so - called wesenheit function ( @xmath1 ) , can be demonstrated to be largely immune to changes in the shape of the instability strip that may then be reflected in changes in the slope of the @xmath2 relation .",
    "ngeow & kanbur ( 2005 ) have already demonstrated in one instance ( the large magellanic cloud cepheid sample ) the robust nature of w in this regard . in the following",
    "we show why this is more generally true .",
    "we begin by noting that , for all stars , stephan s law in combination with simple spherical geometry gives rise to a two - parameter mapping of radius and effective temperature into total luminosity . by the definition of effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) we have    @xmath4    allowing a photometric color ( ( v - i)@xmath5 , say ) to stand in for temperature , and a monochromatic magnitude ( m@xmath6 , say ) to substitute for bolometric luminosity ,",
    "only one more observable is needed to complete the transfer from theory to observation . for cepheids ,",
    "their ( easily observed ) periods can stand in for their ( hard to observe ) radii ; where lines of constant radius in the color - magnitude plane functionally substitute for lines of constant period .",
    "the physically motivated equation above then becomes the following equation based exclusively on observables , while necessarily retaining the form of an equation with two ( and only two ) independent variables : in this case log(p ) and @xmath7 .",
    "thus    @xmath8log(p)@xmath9    it is important to note that both of these above equations describe and cover the infinite plane of the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "there is no period - luminosity relation in either of these equations .",
    "more forcefully stated , equation ( 2 ) is the period - luminosity relation for cepheids .",
    "any general correlation of period and luminosity will only come _ through a constraint _ of these equations .",
    "that constraint , in the context of cepheids , is imposed by the existence of an instability strip within which the natural period of oscillation is excited , and manifest as a periodic change of luminosity .",
    "the instability strip , expressed as an additional and external mathematical constraint on the above equations , produces the observed period - luminosity relations by narrowing down the range of luminosities seen at any given period .",
    "the slope of the red and blue boundaries to the instability strip as they cut lines of constant period determines the slope of the pl relation .",
    "this was first illustrated and emphasized in madore & freedman ( 1991 ) , their figure 3 .    before advancing further",
    ", we introduce the wesenheit function @xmath10 .",
    "this specific combination of magnitude and color is explicitly constructed so as to mathematically guarantee that their sum will be numerically independent of the total amount of interstellar extinction . with foreknowledge that ( by definition ) @xmath11 , and again having the added definitions that @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with simple algebra    @xmath14    then    @xmath15    which upon regrouping terms becomes    @xmath16 + [ a_v - r_{vi } \\times e(v - i)]$ ]    by construction and definition the last two terms sum to zero , leaving    @xmath17    in other words , @xmath1 , as constructed from observed ( reddened ) colors and ( extincted ) magnitudes , is numerically equivalent to @xmath18 , as it would be calculated from intrinsic colors and intrinsic magnitudes .",
    "this occurs , it must be noted , without any explicit knowledge of the reddenings and/or extinctions involved .",
    "simply put , @xmath1 is reddening - independent .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of @xmath1 is illuminating .",
    "as figure 1 illustrates , lines of constant @xmath1 fall , by construction , identically along reddening trajectories having a slope of @xmath19 .",
    "whether a star is at position b because it was reddened from its intrinsic position at a , or whether it is there because that is its intrinsic color and magnitude , is irrelevant : @xmath1 collapses the color - magnitude diagram in such a way that the distinction usually made by reddening is moot .",
    "all stars along a given reddening trajectory will have the same value of @xmath1 .",
    "stars with a given value of @xmath1 may have any value of reddening .",
    "we now interface @xmath1 to equation 2 .",
    "first of all    @xmath20    and so    @xmath21log(p)@xmath22    clearly if @xmath23 then @xmath1 will be not only reddening - free but it will also be a dispersionless function of period alone , with slope = @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , it appears observationally that @xmath25 and @xmath26 must be quite similar in magnitude given the fact that the dispersion in @xmath1 is found to be very small ( i.e. , on the order of @xmath270.08  mag ) .",
    "let us take the mean ridge - line relation between magnitude and color ( defining the instability strip that is to act as the constraint on the @xmath28 ) to be represented by @xmath29 .",
    "it then follows from equation 2 that    @xmath30 ~$]log(p)@xmath31 $ ]    and    @xmath32 ~$]log(p)@xmath33 $ ] .",
    "scatter in these mean ( period - luminosity ) relations will be determined by the color width of the instability strip multiplied by ( the projection factor ) @xmath25 , in the case of monochromatic @xmath2 relations , and multipled by ( @xmath34 ) in the case of the wesenheit functions . as noted above ,",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath35 are of similar magnitude then the scatter in the wesenheit function will be less than the scatter in the corresponding @xmath2 relations by the factor @xmath36 . should @xmath25 equal @xmath35 then @xmath1 would be dispersionless .    if the instability strip ( the constraint imposed upon equation 2 ) moves in a way that changes the slope of the mean period - luminosity relation through a change in @xmath37 this will result in a change in the slope of the mean w - logp relation , @xmath38 = @xmath39 \\times \\delta s$ ] . for",
    "the same tilt in the instability strip @xmath37 , the slope in the monochromatic pl relation will change by @xmath40 .",
    "this means that a 10% change ( say ) in the slope of the v - band @xmath2 relation mapped to @xmath1 would be reduced by a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "this is the same factor that results in the decreased scatter observed in @xmath1 as compared to the scatter at fixed period in the v - band @xmath2 relation . in the extreme case where @xmath25 equals @xmath35",
    "then @xmath1 would not change its slope at all for any change in tilt of the instability strip .",
    "the central portion of figure 1 shows a v-(v - i ) color - magnitude diagram with two possible realizations of the cepheid instability strip cutting across lines of constant period as laid down by the underlying period - luminosity - color relation .",
    "the strip to the left is significantly more vertical that the strip to the right .",
    "both instability strips share the same zero point in this realization , but they could differ without changing the conclusions of this paper .",
    "fiducial points are marked in both strips by open and filled circles .",
    "the filled circles in the more highly inclined strip mark the blue and red borders of the instability strip at two distinct periods .",
    "the open circles in the left - hand strip mark the same color boundaries at precisely the same two periods .",
    "the downward - sloping dashed lines crossing the entire figure are lines of constant period .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines carry the individual data points in the tilted instability strip over to the right and into its corresponding @xmath2 relation .",
    "data from the steep instability strip map to the left @xmath2 relation . clearly by tilting the instability",
    "strip one generates @xmath2 relations with different slopes .",
    "however , by projecting the instability strips along lines of constant period , as is done by following the broken lines to the upper left panel , one finds a dispersionless @xmath2 relation as defined by @xmath42 which , in addition to having no scatter , is incapable of distinguishing between stars originating either in the vertical or the tilted instability strip .",
    "the solid lines emanating from the filled data points in the tilted instability strip show the trajectories of reddening lines .",
    "their slight divergence from lines of constant period results in a composite w - logp relation that has some residual scatter and a slight dependence of its slope on the originating slant of the instability strip . unlike the gross differences seen in the ( left and right ) monochromatic pl relations the divergence in the @xmath42 relations can hardly be resolved and require an exploded view as given in figure 2 to see the impact .",
    "it has been claimed ( sandage & tammann 2008 , their table 1 ) that variations in the slope of the v - band @xmath2 relation are found at the 5% level around a median value of about -2.75 among nearby galaxies ( excluding the poorly populated sextans a / b data point ) in which cepheids have been discovered . if one were to rely exclusively on v - band @xmath2 relations for cepheid distances that might be cause for concern .",
    "but such is not the case .",
    "virtually all modern studies of the distances to galaxies as gauged by optical observations of cepheids use @xmath1 .",
    "for the sake of the following calculation we assume that @xmath26 = 2.45 ( as in freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) and that @xmath43 ( as derived , for example , from the sample of galactic cepheids observed by benedict et al .",
    "2008 , illustrated in figure 3 ) . in this case",
    "the reduction factor @xmath44 to @xmath1 in the slope change as given above is @xmath45 .",
    "that is , a 5% change in slope seen in v - band @xmath2 relation translates into a 1.5% change in slope of the mean @xmath1-logp relation . had @xmath25 and r been numerically identical then there would have been absolutely no impact of a change in the disposition of the instability strip on the slope of the mean @xmath1-logp relation . and",
    "indeed this would be almost exactly the case if we had adopted the value of @xmath25 = 2.43 as advocated by sandage & tammann ( 2008 ) based on a study of lmc cepheids . in that case the 5% slope changes in the optical would reduce to a less that two - tenths of a percent change in the slope in @xmath1 .",
    "we do not believe that either @xmath25 or @xmath35 are currently known to 10% precision themselves , so the exercise must be taken cautiously , being illustrative rather than definitive .",
    "the point stands however that the slope of @xmath1 is clearly going to be relatively impervious to possible changes in the slopes at optical wavelengths .",
    "not only does the scatter intrinsic to the @xmath1-logp relation collapse with respect to the optical @xmath2 relations , but the slope of the @xmath1-logp relation is also very insensitive to changes in slope of the originating optical @xmath2 relations .",
    "changes in the tilt of the instability strip that naturally explain and will give rise to changes in slopes of the monochromatic @xmath2 relations are greatly diminished in their overall impact in the projection of data into the @xmath1-logp plane .",
    "the wesenheit function is defined to be reddening - free ; however its slope is additionally and coincidently very resistant to changes in the slopes of the originating monochromatic , optical @xmath2 relations .",
    "the demonstration by ngeow & kanbur ( 2005 ) that the wesenheit function for lmc cepheids does not show any evidence for a break in slope over the full range of observed periods is a predictable and universal feature of @xmath1 .",
    "it naturally follows from the closely coincident slopes of the lines of constant period and reddening trajectories .    since @xmath1 is already the default method for determining true moduli to nearby galaxies when using cepheids observed at optical wavelengths , we conclude that slope changes in the @xmath44-band @xmath2 relations , confirmed or not , will have minimal impact on the wesenheit function , or the distance scale based upon it .",
    "this point has already been made by ngeow & kanbur ( 2006 ) where they suggest that slope changes may affect determinations of @xmath46 at the 1 - 2% level .",
    "this paper was written while the authors were in residence at linstitute dastrophysique and lobservatoire de paris .",
    "we each thank professor daniel egret , director of the paris observatory , and dr .",
    "stephan charlot at iap for the opportunity to be with them for an extended visit and for their kind hospitality and support during that time .",
    "finally , we thank the referee for carefully reading the manuscript and alerting us to transcription errors in the first draft of this paper .                                        * fig .",
    "2  an expanded view of the @xmath47-logp relation as generated by two instability strips of different tilt .",
    "the slight offset in slopes between the lines of constant period and reddening lines leads to dispersion in w and a ( very ) slight relative tilt of the two relations . both the dispersion and change in slope collapse to zero linearly with the difference ( @xmath25 - @xmath48 ) . *        * fig .",
