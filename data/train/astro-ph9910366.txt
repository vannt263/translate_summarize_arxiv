    "the analysis of gravitational lensing of the primordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is of growing interest since it gives a direct probe of the mass distribution up to very high redshift .",
    "the detection of the lens effects on the cmb would be very precious for constraining the cosmological parameters , with no ambiguities about the distance of the source plane .",
    "although the effect on the cmb power spectrum is rather weak and affects only small scales ( @xmath1 ) it is now recognized that gravitational lensing can produce some specific features worth for investigation . in this paper",
    "we focus our investigations on the temperature maps only although it has been noticed recently that lenses can also affect significantly the polarization properties of the cmb maps ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far there are two distinct effects that kept the attention : the small ( sub - arcmin ) scale strong deformation of the temperature fluctuations which can be used to probe galaxy cluster gravitational potential ( @xcite , @xcite ) and an intermediate and large scale statistical effect ( bernardeau 1997 , 1998 , @xcite ) which is a way to determine the cosmological parameters and provides a consistency test against other cmb analysis .",
    "the detection of the small scale lens effects , remains to be proved feasible .",
    "in particular the accumulation of secondary anisotropies ( such as the sunyaev - zeldovich and ostriker - vishniac effects , and the non - linear sachs - wolfe effect ) will mask the primordial lens effects and make the interpretation of lensed secondary anisotropies dependent on the _ unknown _ redshift where the secondary anisotropies where generated . at scales above 1 or 2 arcmins",
    ", the interpretation of the lens effects should be more straightforward but the number density of fluctuations is not large enough to allow an accurate mass reconstruction of the lens ( in particular in the case of clusters of galaxies ) . therefore at scales larger than a few arcmin only a statistical detection of the lens effect seems possible .",
    "more specifically bernardeau ( 1998 ) investigated the effect of lensing by the large - scale structures on the distribution of the cmb ellipticities .",
    "the consequences are the same as for the lensed distant galaxies : the gravitational distortion induces an excess of elongated structures of cmb ellipticities .",
    "the intrinsic cmb ellipticity distribution being known for a gaussian field ( e.g. bond & efstathiou 1987 ) it is then possible to compute the lensed distribution .",
    "the lensed distribution is unfortunately rather close to the unlensed one , in particular because the smoothing caused by the cmb beam tends to circularizes the local structures .",
    "the orientation of the local ellipticity is expected to be much more robust against the smoothing effects and therefore more efficient in tracing the lens effects . due to the low number density of structures on cmb maps",
    "such effects can be hardly detected in cmb maps alone , so in this paper we rather investigate the possible cross - correlation of cmb ellipticities with the distant galaxy ellipticities .",
    "it has been recognized before that a fair fraction of the lenses that act on cmb temperature maps are at low redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are different consequences .",
    "temperature maps and galactic density survey should exhibit some correlations ( @xcite ) , and it induces a non - zero three - point function ( or equivalently a bispectrum ) in the cmb maps ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the coupling between lens effects and low redshift primary or secondary anisotropies such as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect or the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .    in this paper",
    "we focus our analysis in the expected correlation between the cmb ellipticities and those of distant galaxies .",
    "we indeed expect their relative angle to be not - uniformly distributed unlike what would happend if there were no lensing effects .",
    "we examine here the amplitude and the observability of this effect .",
    "it is worth stressing that , unlike in the analysis performed by @xcite , the correlation signal we are aiming at is independent on any possible galaxy bias .",
    "it would then provide a complementary constraint on the fundamental cosmological parameters a priori independent on those provided by the observations of the primary anisotropies .",
    "we discuss the physical mechanism , and introduce the relevant quantities in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we investigate the amplitude of the effect for different cosmologies and we calculate the signal - to - noise ratio in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is a discussion on the contribution of the different possible foreground contaminations before we conclude in section 6 .",
    "a bundle of light rays coming from a high redshift source from the direction @xmath2 is deflected by a quantity @xmath3 , whose derivatives @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the isotropic and anisotropic deformation of the light bundle . the convergence @xmath6 and the shear @xmath7 depend on the integrated gravitational potential along the line - of - sight @xmath8 and",
    "distort the image of distant galaxies as well as the cmb fluctuations .    at any position on the cmb temperature map",
    ", we can define an ellipticity @xmath9 from the curvature of the temperature field @xmath10 : @xmath11 this relation is similar to the ellipticity of a galaxy defined from its second order moments .",
    "a peak of temperature with the same curvature on both axis has a zero ellipticity , but in opposition with the galaxies , the cmb ellipticity can take any value between zero ( circular peaks ) and infinity ( symmetric saddle points ) . however , it is always meaningful to define the orientation of the cmb ellipticity @xmath12 , which runs from 0 to @xmath13 .",
    "the gravitational lensing effect tends to stretch the structures and therefore to produce an excess of elongated structures relative to the number of rather round objects ( bernardeau ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "the lenses tend also to align the cmb ellipticity with the shear @xmath14 acting on the cmb at the angular position @xmath8 .",
    "this is similar to the effect which occurs on the ellipticity of distant galaxies , althought the corresponding shear @xmath15 can not be identified with @xmath14 since the galaxies are at much lower redshift .",
    "the variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 are however correlated because the light coming from either the cmb or the distant galaxies are passing through the same portion of low - redshift universe , and consequently , for a given line - of - sight @xmath8 , the cmb ellipticities are preferentially aligned with the distant galaxies .    in the paradigm of inflation , the cmb fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "therefore the un - lensed cmb ellipticity distribution is very specific and furthermore independent on the shape of the temperature power spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of gravitational lensing on the statistic of a gaussian random field can be calculated analytically , at least using perturbative methods . according to ( [ edef1 ] ) ,",
    "the fields of interest are the second derivatives of the temperature field , which defines the cmb ellipticity .",
    "it is usefull to introduce the matrix of the second order derivatives @xmath16 @xmath17 where the cmb ellipticity ( [ edef1 ] ) is defined as in bond & efstathiou ( 1987 ) as , @xmath18 we want to calculate the effect of lensing on @xmath9 and write the lensed ellipticity @xmath19 as a function of @xmath9 , the shear @xmath7 and the convergence @xmath6 . for this",
    "we need to calculate the lensed quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 and expand the expressions using the weak lensing approximation @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of weak lensing is only a re - mapping of the temperature fluctuations through the displacement field @xmath3 , with no modification of the temperature amplitude , @xmath23 the magnification matrix is the jacobian of the transformation between the source and the image plane .",
    "it is given by the first derivatives of the displacement field :    @xmath24    where @xmath6 is the convergence and @xmath7 the shear .",
    "the lensed curvature matrix calculated from eq.([curvmat ] ) and ( [ mapping ] ) is ( @xcite ) :    @xmath25    the first term is identical to the lensing term for galaxies , and the second term makes intervene the spatial derivatives of @xmath6 and @xmath26 .",
    "this second term accounts for the variation of the amplification matrix accross the cmb patterns .",
    "it can not be a priori neglected because the scale at which the shear is estimated corresponds roughly to the filtering scale , a scale over which the shear might significantly change .",
    "note that for the galaxy field , the shear is measured at a much smaller scale ( the galaxy size ) , and the shear gradient term is always neglected .",
    "however we will assume later that the shear field is gaussian ( which is a reasonable approximation for scales larger than a few arcmin ) , for which the shear gradient is uncorrelated to the shear itself .",
    "therefore we expect the shear gradients to play no role in the cross - correlation pattern . as a result , in the following , the second term of eq .",
    "( [ lensshapeeq ] ) will be ignored for the lensed cmb ellipticities as well .",
    "it is then easy to obtain the transformation equations for @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 the lensed ellipticity @xmath19 is obtained from eq.([e_def ] ) and ( [ gtau_lensed ] ) : @xmath30 note that this is very similar to the galaxy ellipticity transformation relations ( @xcite ) for which we have @xmath31 if @xmath32 is the intrinsic galaxy ellipticity .",
    "it is remarkable that the lensed ellipticity does not depend on the convergence @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the angle between @xmath19 and the shear @xmath14 at the redshift of the cmb , and @xmath34 the angle between @xmath19 and the shear of the distant galaxies @xmath15 : @xmath35 we should emphasize that the angles @xmath36 are twice the physical angles measured from the temperature map and the distant galaxies ( e.g. @xmath37 means that a lensed temperature fluctuation is perpendicular to a sheared distant galaxy , if they were both intrinsically circular ) .",
    "we want to calculate the probability distribution function @xmath38 of the relative orientation between the lensed cmb ellipticity and the sheared distant galaxies .",
    "this can be done by marginalizing the joint probability @xmath39 over @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt the point of view of conditional probability and write @xmath41 as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( which is a pure lensing contribution ) , is the joint probability that the shear is @xmath7 at the last - scattering surface and @xmath44 for the distant galaxies .",
    "@xmath45 is the probability to observe a lensed cmb ellipticity @xmath46 when the shear is @xmath7 at the last - scattering surface .",
    "it is calculated from the ellipticity distribution function @xmath47 of the unlensed cmb ( @xcite ) :    @xmath48    from the eq.([e_lensed ] ) and the weak lensing approximation ( @xmath49 ) we get , @xmath50 the integration over @xmath51 gives the desired probability ( [ desired_proba ] ) as a function of @xmath52 only , @xmath53    at this stage we need a model for @xmath43 .",
    "both the observables @xmath19 and @xmath44 will respectively be measured on the temperature fluctuation map and a galaxy survey . due to the limited beam size of the bolometers",
    ", we can not hope to measure @xmath19 with a resolution better than a few arcmin .",
    "let @xmath54 be this beam size , and @xmath55 be the smoothing length used to measure @xmath56 .",
    "these two smoothing scales can be totally different , and we will find latter that the better signal - to - noise is optained when they are equal .",
    "this discussion is left aside for now , and we assume in the following that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are both larger than a few arcmin .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume a gaussian distribution for the variable @xmath57 $ ] , and to write @xmath43 as a multivariate gaussian distribution , @xmath58 , \\label{plens}\\ ] ] whose correlation matrix @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 we used the property @xmath61 ( valid for the weak lensing limit ) , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",

    "note that the probability ( [ plens ] ) only depends on the relative orientation between @xmath7 and @xmath44 since we can choose any origin for the orientations .",
    "figure [ corcoef ] shows ( for lcdm ) the correlation function @xmath65 for a fixed @xmath66 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "the moments of the convergence are calculated using the perturbation theory and the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum given by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note on this figure that the maximum correlation is reached when @xmath55 and @xmath66 are nearly equal .    with a formal calculator eq.([proba_lens ] )",
    "can be integrated without difficulties over @xmath26 , @xmath56 and @xmath33 in order to get the final result : @xmath67 this equation constitutes the main result of this paper .",
    "it shows how much the relative orientation of the cmb ellipticity with the distant galaxies deviates from a random distribution , because of the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the amplitude of this effect for different cosmological models and different smoothing scales .",
    "we assumed a cdm power spectrum taking into account its non - linear evolution as described by @xcite .",
    "the deviation from a uniform distribution can be as large as @xmath0 , and the effect seems mostly sensitive to the curvature of the universe rather than @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "a possible observable is the average of @xmath70 over the total survey area : @xmath71 if the cmb ellipticities are significantly aligned with the distant galaxies , then @xmath72 should be significantly larger than zero .",
    "some values of @xmath72 are given in table [ theestimator ] for various cosmological models and smoothing schemes .",
    "in order to compute the signal - to - noise of the quantity ( [ thequantity ] ) , let us assume that we have at our disposal a cmb temperature map and a shear map of distant galaxies of angular area @xmath73 .",

    "this will give , by construction , the signal - to - noise of the cmb - lens positive detection against the hypothesis of no lensing on cmb .",
    "in that case the lensing and the cmb distribution functions are separable and can be written , @xmath86 using eq .",

    "one needs the temperature and the convergence correlation functions .",
    "the temperature correlation function can be evaluated from the angular cmb power spectrum @xmath118 given by the cmbfast code ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "however , we have to include the beam size effect ( which tends to enlarge the temperature correlation function and therefore to increase the noise ) and to correct for the instrumental noise . this can be achieved by a suitable wiener filtering of the power spectrum .",
    "the filtered @xmath119 are given by    @xmath120    where @xmath121 gives the beam size and @xmath122 is the typical level of noise for experiments like map and planck ( @xmath123 is the noise variance per pixel , and @xmath124 the pixel solid angle ) . the correlation function is then given by the standard legendre polynomial expansion :    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the angle between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the convergence correlation function is calculated as in section 3 , using the perturbation theory with the non - linear power spectrum evolution as described in @xcite .",
    "we then performed a numerical integration of ( [ finalnoise ] ) for standard - cmd , open - cdm and @xmath69-cdm cosmological models .",
    "the signal - to - noise is given in the table [ theestimator ] for different cosmologies , smoothing lengths .",
    "the survey size is assumed to be @xmath127 .",
    "the signal to noise ratio scales roughly like the square root of the area for larger surveys . a very good signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath128 )",
    "can be obtained at small smoothing scale , however even in the large smoothing scale case a significant detection can be obtained .",
    "this result contrasts with previous analysis of lensing on cmb where these typical signal - to - noise ratios were obtained with a whole sky survey .",
    "figure [ ssurnfunc ] shows how the signal - to - noise evolves with @xmath55 for different values of the beam size @xmath129 . the maximum signal - to - noise",
    "is obtained for @xmath55 comparable to @xmath54 , which is a consequence that at small scales the sheared galaxies behave essentially like a noise for the lensed temperature fluctuations , and at large scale the signal is smoothed away .",
    "undoubtedly , secondary anisotropies and foregrounds can affect our conclusions and should be examined in details .",
    "they may affect our calculations in three different ways : first some cmb fluctuations might be generated at low redshift and the assumption the source plane is located at @xmath130 breaks down ; secondary anisotropies are correlated with low redshift mass concentrations which might introduce spurious correlations between cmb ellipticities and galaxy shear ; galactic foregrounds can change our estimation of the cosmic variance .",
    "we compare in the next paragraphs the importance of various secondary effects .",
    "tsz effect is the most important source of secondary anisotropies .",
    "it corresponds to the scattering of cmb photons on electrons of the hot cluster gaz . during the scattering",
    ", the photon energy is redistributed from the low frequency to high frequency part of the black body energy distribution .",
    "the net effect is a deficit of photons at low frequency ( resp .",
    "an excess at high frequency ) , which creates a negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) fluctuation in the cmb map .",
    "such fluctuations , essentially centered on clusters of galaxies ( where the gaz is hot enough ) creates a specific ellipticity pattern , correlated with the gravitational shear generated by those clusters .",
    "therefore the ensemble average @xmath82 ( eq.([thequantity ] ) ) is not expected to vanish , even in the absence of gravitational lensing .",
    "the importance of this contribution depends on the amplitude and the extension of tsz , and it is beyond the scope of this paper to perform an exact calculation .",
    "however we know that the amplitude of tsz is proportional to the gaz temperature , which is important in the inner part of galaxy clusters only , at scales 1 - 2 ( see @xcite , where the tsz is calculated ) .",
    "tsz coming from larger scales ( filaments for instance ) do not have a significant contribution ( @xcite ) . therefore by observing the cmb at a resolution of 5 or larger , tsz should not be a problem . for smaller scales it can become difficult to disentangle between the lensing effect and the ellipticity - shear correlation generated by tsz",
    ". however we should emphasize that it is always possible to suppress this effect by either observing at 217 ghz ( for which tsz vanishes ) or by cleaning tsz taking advantage of its specific spectral signature .",
    "although these effects are sometime discussed separately in the litterature , they have the same physical origin : this is a doppler effect caused by the electron bulk motion .",
    "ov is a perturbative effect , while ksz is a non - linear effect which can be important in the inner part of the clusters .",
    "ov is negligeable at scale larger than 3 , but its contribution increases quickly with decreasing scale , and equals the primary spectrum at 2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ksz provides a significant increase of the ov only for scales smaller than 2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore as long as we work at scales larger than 2 - 3 , , ksz and ov are not important for our purpose . at smaller scales it become essential to estimate their contribution to @xmath72 .",
    "isw and rs effects describe the frequency shift of a cmb photon when it crosses a time evolving gravitational potential well .",
    "the induced fluctuations are pure gravitational effects .",
    "the first order isw occurs only for universes different than @xmath131 because for the flat @xmath132 universe the growth rate of structures is compensated by the universe expansion",
    ". however there is always a non - linear isw due to the time evolving potential of non - linear collapsing structures , which occurs in all cosmologies ( the rees - sciama effect ) .",
    "the amplitude of rs was computed by @xcite who found a very small contribution for @xmath133 .",
    "it is therefore irrelevant for our purpose .",
    "@xcite calculated the power spectrum contribution of galactic foreground and extra - galactic point sources .",
    "the galactic foreground contamination is dominant only at very large scales ( @xmath134 ) , but the point sources spectrum might become important for @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately the clustering properties of the point sources does not play a significant role ( @xcite ) , therefore their contribution is essentially white noise , which makes their removal possible , as long as we have a good model for them ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have computed the amplitude of the correlation between the lensed cmb ellipticities and the lensed galaxy ellipticities to the leading order of perturbation theory .",
    "we found that the modulation of the relative angle distribution can be as high as 10% for a smoothing scale of @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 .",
    "this lensing effect extends to scales well beyond the anisotropies generated by the foreground contamination and therefore it should be easily detectable with a low resolution experiment provided that the survey is large enough . in particular , future wide galaxy surveys ( sloan ) used jointly with all sky cmb experiments ( map , planck ) are very promising for the measurement of such a lens effect .",
    "a sky coverage of only @xmath138 will improve the signal - to - noise by a factor of 4 those given in table [ theestimator ] . at scales larger than a few arcmin ,",
    "any detected correlation between the cmb ellipticities and the shear of the distant galaxies can only be produced by lensing ( since foregrounds contribution is too weak ) , this does not depend whether the cmb is intrinsically gaussian or not ( although we used the gaussian approximation for the calculations ) .    at the arcmin scale and below ,",
    "the secondary fluctuations becomes important , and the contribution of each foreground should be carrefully estimated .",
    "moreover , at such small scales , the cmb and shear fields can not be approximated by gaussian field , and one might go beyond by considering a weakly non - gaussian distribution like the edgeworth expansion .",
    "the computation of the signal to noise ratio were made in a simplified way .",
    "in particular we assumed that the smoothing @xmath54 for @xmath6 takes most of the effects associated with the beam smoothing , which we believe should be a good approximation as long as the ellipticity orientations only are concerned .",
    "we plan to check this aspect in numerical simulations .",
