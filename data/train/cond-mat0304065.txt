    "it is therefore fortunate that recent work has demonstrated how to consistently implement site occupation restrictions into the bosonic field theory @xcite . for the above binary processes ,",
    "the reaction part of the action becomes @xmath242 .",
    "\\ \\label{anfra}\\ ] ] here the exponential terms capture the occupation number limitations , with @xmath243 = \\kappa^{-d}$ ] , which suggests that @xmath244 represents a _ dangerously irrelevant _ coupling . indeed , consider more generally the coupled reactions @xmath7 with @xmath245 and @xmath246 with @xmath247 , which display a continuous transition for @xmath248 .",
    "the mean - field equations obtained from the associated actions show that site occupation restrictions can be neglected at low densities , yielding the critical exponents @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath131 , and @xmath251 , except for the degenerate case @xmath252 , where one finds @xmath253 , whence @xmath231 , @xmath254 , @xmath131 , and @xmath255 @xcite . for @xmath118 ,",
    "expanding the exponentials leads to the action ( [ dpsft ] ) , which establishes that the competing processes @xmath1 , @xmath256 with site exclusion yield a dp phase transition .",
    "the above field theory should also permit a systematic analysis of the fluctuation corrections for the purely binary and triplet reactions .",
    "for the latter , one expects mere logarithmic corrections at @xmath148 to the mean - field scaling laws ; yet current simulations are inconclusive @xcite .",
    "in this overview , i have outlined how non - linear stochastic processes via their defining master equation can be represented by field theory actions , allowing for a thorough analysis and classification by means of the renormalization group .",
    "systems with a single ` particle ' species that display a non - equilibrium phase transition from an active to an inactive , absorbing state are generically captured by the directed percolation universality class .",
    "the second prominent example , sometimes applicable when additional symmetries ( degenerate absorbing states ) are present , is the parity - conserving universality class of even - offspring branching and annihilating random walks .",
    "the only other scenarios for non - trivial critical scaling behavior appear to be provided by the solely pair or triplet annihilation ",
    "fission reactions , where site occupation restrictions become relevant .",
    "the full classification of reaction - diffusion models with multiple particle species remains a formidable task .",
    "even the difference in diffusivities may become a relevant control parameter @xcite . specifically in one dimension , exclusion constraints can play a crucial role @xcite .",
    "another obviously important open problem concerns the influence of quenched disorder in the reaction rates .",
    "for example , a field theory rg investigation for dp with random percolation threshold yields run - away flows @xcite , reflected in intriguing simulation results with not entirely clear interpretation @xcite . a very recent strong disorder rg study , supplemented with numerical density matrix rg calculations , has revealed a novel disorder fixed point @xcite . a better understanding of spatially varying reaction rates might also explain the conspicuous rarity of clear - cut experimental realizations even for the supposedly ubiquitous dp universality class @xcite .",
    "in fact the single verification of dp scaling behavior appears to be its observation in spatio - temporal intermittency in ferrofluidic spikes @xcite .",
    "thus many intriguing issues are still open ; but i expect that in addition to increasingly more extensive monte carlo simulations and sophisticated numerical techniques , field theory representations and subsequent analysis by means of the renormalization group will remain an invaluable tool for the further understanding of cooperative phenomena and scale - invariance in interacting non - equilibrium systems .    _ acknowledgements : _ i am grateful for the opportunity to present this overview at the 2003 dpg spring meeting .",
