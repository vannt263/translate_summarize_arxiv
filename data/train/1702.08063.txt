    "the tremendous progress of understanding of perturbative superstring theory as well as its duality symmetries in various spacetime backgrounds  @xcite has led to a well substantiated proposal of m theory , the unifying theory of all superstring theories  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the new objects contained in m - theory which are solitonic gravitational back - reactions of various d - branes , are the m2 and m5-branes .",
    "these objects were expected naturally from the eleven dimensional ( 11d ) supergravity and , in this framework , they are considered as fundamental as the strings are for the various 10d supergravities .",
    "the basic obstacle in understanding these objects as fundamentals , lies in the absence of a coupling constant and the consequent problem of the definition of their self - interactions .",
    "an interesting proposal to define the self - interactions of the branes is to use their euclidean instantons to interpolate between vacua ( asymptotic states ) with different number of branes  @xcite .",
    "the simplest ones could be instantons interpolating between states of one and two branes .",
    "the study of the simplest such instantons is already a difficult problem but one hopes that finding explicit solutions and trying to understand their moduli space would be and interesting approach .",
    "the classification of all such instantons and the geometry of their moduli space is probably beyond the present day capabilities .",
    "almost three decades ago the problem of determining the corresponding self - duality equations for membranes has been solved in the case of @xmath10 dimensional embedding spacetime in ref  @xcite and in the case of @xmath11 in ref  @xcite . in the latter , using results from the study of nahm equations  @xcite for yang - mills ( ym ) monopoles it was shown that the self - duality equations form an integrable model and its lax pair and conserved quantities were determined",
    ". an important work by ward  @xcite clarified further the situation reducing the self - duality equations to laplace equation in 3d flat space , for the time function of the surface . this function is a level set function -as it is called in morse theory- and the problem of determining topology changing membrane instantons is reduced into the search for non - trivial ( multi - valued ) time functions .",
    "recent progress in this direction has been made in the works  @xcite .",
    "the classification of self - duality ( sd ) equations in various dimensions has shown that the possible sd equations are determined by the existence of cross products of vectors which in turn is related to the four division algebras  @xcite . apart from the trivial cases of branes of dimension @xmath12 embedded in @xmath13 space dimensions , the interesting cases concern the @xmath2 brane ( membrane ) and the @xmath0 brane .    in references @xcite and @xcite the study of membrane instanton equations in higher dimensions has provided some insight in the difficulty of the problem and certain explicit solutions have been obtained ( see also references  @xcite-@xcite ) . in the present work we extend the study to the case of 3-branes in @xmath14 spatial dimensions using the octonionic cross product for three 8-dimensional vectors . we obtain a convenient form of a four complex set for the sd equations which enable us to reduce the sd equations in six dimensions .",
    "the sd equations imply the euclidean second order equations for the 3-branes and satisfy automatically the gauss law of volume preserving diffeomorphisms symmetry of the theory . in the case of external fluxes in the theory such as the one coming from @xmath15-wave supersymmetric gravitational backgrounds , it is possible to redefine the time and to reduce the sd equations to the case of flat background , and find explicit solutions for the 3-sphere and the 3-torus . in the case of the sphere the instantons are periodic in euclidean time going from a finite radius to infinity and back in finite time , while in the case of the three torus the periodic solution interpolates between finite radii .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the hamiltonian formalism and the equations of motion ( eom ) for 3-branes in the light cone gauge and in flat spacetime , as well as , the corresponding gauss law .",
    "we discuss the symmetry in this gauge which is the volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the 3-brane and which gives the possibility to describe the 3-brane as an incompressible fluid . in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we derive the first order self - duality equations in eight dimensions and its various lower dimensional reductions and we present them in a very useful and suggestive complex form in four - dimensional complex space . we show that these equation imply the second order equations and the gauss law in euclidean signature spacetime . in section 5 , assuming factorization of time , we solve analytically the 3-brane self - duality equations for the case of spherical ( @xmath16 ) and toroidal ( @xmath17 ) topology of the brane .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present our conclusions and discuss the application of our methods to the issue of topology change of three branes , a problem which is relevant to cosmological brane models .",
    "in this section we briefly present the hamiltonian system in terms of the nambu 3-brackets . for the @xmath16 brane in @xmath18 minkowski spacetime",
    "the hamiltonian in the light - cone gauge is = d_3 ( _ i^2+\\{x_i , x_j , x_k}^2 ) [ ham ] where the indices run the @xmath19 transverse dimensions .",
    "the corresponding eom are _",
    "i = \\{\\{x_i ,",
    "x_j , x_k } , x_j , x_k }  , and the gauss law takes the form @xmath20 the volume element is d_3 = _ 2 ^2_3 d_1d_2d_3  , and the nabu 3-bracket for @xmath16 is defined as follows \\{x_i , x_j , x_k } = ^ _ x_i _ x_j _ x_k  for @xmath16 there are four functions , namely the polar coordinates of the unit four - vectors , e_1=_1_2_3 , e_2=_1_2_3 , e_3=_2_3 , e_4=_3  [ r4v ] they satisfy the @xmath21 relations \\{e_a , e_b , e_c } = ^abcde_d , [ so4 ] where the indices take the values @xmath22 .",
    "these equations are instrumental for the factorization of the time from the internal coordinates of the 3-brane .",
    "it is possible to write down explicitly the infinite dimensional algebra of the volume preserving diffeomorphisms @xmath16 , \\{y _ , y _ , y _ } & = & f^_y _ , using as a basis the hyper - spherical harmonics y_()&=&y_nlm(_1,_2 , _ 3 ) , = ( nlm ) , m =- l ,  , l , l=0,1,2 ,  ,",
    "the structure constants @xmath23 can be expressed in terms of the 6-@xmath24 symbols of @xmath25 since @xmath26 .",
    "when the brane has the toroidal topology @xmath17 , the global symmetries are @xmath27 and three translations along the cycles of the torus .",
    "the basis of functions on @xmath17 is taken to be e_n = e^in,^3 , n = ( n_1,n_2,n_3 )  this basis defines an infinite dimensional volume preserving diffeomorphism group of the torus through the nabu - lie 3-algebra \\ { e_n_1 , e_n_2 , e_n_3}= -i det ( n_1,n_2,n_3 ) e_n_1+n_2+n_3  it is important to notice that @xmath28 the above algebra remains invariant under the transformations @xmath29 .",
    "thus , for this 3-dimensional brane there is an important discrete symmetry , namely the 3-dimensional modular group @xmath30 which could have implications in the quantum mechanical spectrum of this object .",
    "the eom for the 3-torus are formally the same as in @xmath16 but it is much more convenient to complexify the eight transverse coordinates to four complex ones as we shall see later in the next section .",
    "it is known that @xmath12-fold , @xmath31-dimensional vector cross products are defined only in the following cases p=1,2,3 ,  & & n = p+1 + p=2&&n=7 + p=3&&n=7 + p=3&&n=8.[crpro ] in the above cases , for any set of @xmath12 vectors , @xmath32 , their @xmath12-fold cross product , which we denote by @xmath33 , is a linear map which satisfies the following properties _ p(v_1,v_2 ,  , v_p)v_k & = & 0 , k=1,2,3 ,  , p , while the norm of the cross product satisfies the important property , |_p(v_1,v_2 ,  , v_p)|^2&= & det(v_iv_j )  [ ncp ] in the present work we will focus on the last case @xmath34 of ( [ crpro ] ) since the other cases can be obtained by appropriate reductions to lower dimensions .",
    "now , we proceed to derive the light - cone self - duality equations for 3-branes living in eight transverse flat dimensions .",
    "we note in passing that it is possible after toroidal compactification to obtain interesting equations for charged 3-branes in lower dimensions .",
    "it is easy to observe that the potential energy term of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the determinant of the induced metric @xmath35 the cross product of three 8-dimensional vectors of case ( [ crpro ] ) is explicitly given as  @xcite _ i(v_1,v_2 , v_3 ) : = _ ijklv_1^jv_2^kv_3^l , = 1,2,8  [ ncp3 ] where the definition of @xmath36 and conventions used in the paper are given in the appendix . setting @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we find that the potential energy of the 3-brane is the norm squared of the above defined cross product of its tangent vectors ( see eq ( [ ncp ] )  ) . another way to see that is to use directly the identity ( [ phiphi ] ) given in the appendix for the tensor @xmath36 .",
    "it is obvious now that the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) of the 3-brane , can be written as = d_3 ( _ i^2+\\{x_i , x_j , x_k}^2 ) d_3 ( _ k - i _ k)(_k+i _",
    "k ) , [ ham2 ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for vacuum configurations , @xmath42 , and in euclidean time we find the self - duality equations _",
    "i = _ ijkl\\{x_j , x_k , x_l }  [ sd8 ]",
    "there is a natural generalization of the self - duality equations in 8 dimensions in terms of the symbol @xmath36 , _",
    "i = _ ijkl\\{x_j , x_k , x_l}. [ sd88 ] where now the indices @xmath43 run for 1 to 8 . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the shorthand notation x_ijk\\{x_i , x_j , x_k}[notijk ] where the indices run from 1 to 8 .",
    "we know however that the same equation exists in seven dimensions that is , @xmath44 , because of the existence of the cross product @xmath45 given in section 3 .",
    "then , employing the definition of @xmath36 given in the appendix , we find that eq ( [ sd88 ] ) implies the following eight non - linear ( first order ) differential equations _ 1&= & x_823+x_865+x_847+x_735+x_762+x_524+x_346 + _ 2&= & x_183+x_684+x_857+x_743+x_167+x_635+x_154 + _ 3&= & x_812+x_485+x_867+x_472+x_751+x_265+x_416 + _ 4&= & x_862+x_835+x_871+x_567+x_732+x_512+x_136[sda ] + _ 5&= & x_816+x_845+x_872+x_647+x_371+x_623+x_146 + _ 6&= & x_851+x_824+x_873+x_457+x_172+x_325+x_314 + _ 7&= & x_814+x_836+x_825+x_546+x_531+x_432+x_612 + _ 8&= & x_321+x_615+x_642+x_534+x_174+x_376+x_275  we notice that the self - duality equations of 3-branes in seven dimensions mentioned before , are simply obtained from the above system , by eliminating the last equation and the terms containing the index 8 on the right - hand side of the remaining seven equations .    next , we proceed to the complexification of the general system ( [ sda ] ) by choosing specific pairing of the 8 real coordinates , as follows z_1= x_1+i x_4 , z_2= x_2+i x_5 , z_3= x_3+i x_6 , z_4= x_8+i x_7  [ x2z ] after some elaborate manipulation of the original system of equations , we arrive at the following simple form _",

    "it is possible from the four complex equations to obtain various interesting reductions to lower dimensions .",
    "for example , if we demand that @xmath48 are real ( i.e. , @xmath49 , or if @xmath50 are all pure imaginary , that @xmath51 , then we obtain the self - duality equation of three branes in four real dimensions _",

    "a more detailed study of toroidal compactifications and double dimension reduction to lower dimensional branes , as well as their relation to extended continuous toda systems , will be discussed in a forthcoming work  @xcite .",
