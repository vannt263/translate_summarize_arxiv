    "mass entrainment of an external medium into a jet flow affects the spatial development of the jet and may be a crucial factor in the division between fr i and fr ii ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio sources .",
    "for example , deceleration , presumably via mass entrainment , of a turbulent , supersonic jet is one of the basic assumptions in the model of bicknell ( 1994 , 1996 ) that reproduces the break between fr i and fr ii sources in the radio - optical plane . additionally , there is evidence for jet slowing in the low - power radio source b2 1144 + 35 , which is observed to decelerate from 0.95@xmath0 to 0.02@xmath0 between 20 pc and 24 kpc from the core ( giovannini et al .",
    "mass entrainment may be important even in slower jet flows , such as the much slower ( 0.1@xmath0 ) parsec - scale jets in seyfert galaxies ( ulvestad et al .",
    "since our simulations do not include radiative cooling , which is a crucial element in the energetics of protostellar jets , the simulations we present here are not strictly applicable to those systems , although perhaps they are appropriate for the jets in galactic superluminals .",
    "rosen et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter rhcj ) confirmed that a reasonably strong magnetic field can slow mass entrainment by a three - dimensional , nonrelativistic , cylindrical supermagnetosonic jet .",
    "rhcj showed that the spatial growth of mass entrainment is a three - stage process that corresponds to the growth of the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability , from a linear stage through a nonlinear stage to a stage where the growth has become saturated .",
    "rhcj also found three stages of growth in the width of simulated radio intensity maps of the jets , and that these three stages in the width are associated with those of the growth of the jet plus entrained mass .",
    "however , some detailed differences did exist in the position of the transition between stages as a function of jet density .",
    "these differences usually occurred for jets lighter than the external medium , and took the form of continued mass entrainment even though the width in a simulated intensity image of the jet remained constant . a jet that entrains",
    "mass could have an observable spine - sheath morphology , in which the spine is more disrupted in a jet that is lighter than the external medium .",
    "in fact , recent application of the  spectral tomography \" process ( katz - stone et al .",
    "1999 ) has revealed the presence of a low intensity , steep spectrum sheath surrounding a high intensity , flat spectrum core or jet spine in a few wide - angle tail radio sources .",
    "in addition , rhcj found that the linear growth of jet plus entrained mass was related to a linear progression as higher order , small amplitude kh modes with short growth lengths are overwhelmed by lower order , larger amplitude kh modes with larger growth lengths .    in this paper , we extend our mass entrainment analysis to conical supermagnetosonic jets that have inlet conditions similar to some of the jets in rhcj . based on the kh linear stability analysis for supermagnetosonic jets in hardee , clarke , & rosen ( 1997 , hereafter hcr ) , the growth length at maximum growth ( i.e. , the inverse of the spatial growth rate at maximum growth ) is proportional to the radius of the jet . additionally , the maximum growth rates are reduced along an adiabatically cooling jet , in which the mach number increases with the jet expansion ( hardee 1986 ) . thus ,",
    "in general on supermagnetosonic jets the instability should grow more slowly as the radius expands than on a cylindrical jet .",
    "we investigate whether expanding supermagnetosonic jets are more stable than similar cylindrical jets and also whether expanding jets show the similar association between the spatial development of mass entrainment , the spatial development of the kh instability and the spatial development of the apparent width of magnetized material in simulated radio intensity images that has been seen previously in cylindrical jet simulations ( rhcj ) .",
    "examination of the potentially smaller effects of the kh instability on conical jets is an important extension of previous work , as there are observational examples of conical jets , some of which expand by orders of magnitude and remain undisrupted for more than 100 kpc .",
    "for example , the jet in m87 expands at a nearly constant rate in a recent high resolution ( 0@xmath1 8.2 pc ) radio image of the source out to knot a ( biretta , zhou , & owen 1995 ) .",
    "another example of jet expansion is provided by ngc 6251 , which has a jet that passes through a series of expansions , each of which has an average half - opening angle of @xmath24  for at least 10 kiloparsecs in length ( perley et al .  1984 ) .",
    "the jets in both of these radio sources appear more laminar than turbulent in the regions where the jets are conical .",
    "since we aim to investigate the spatial growth of the kh instability and mass entrainment , the simulations we discuss here span a significant axial length and are considered completed only after much of the computed region reaches a quasi - steady state .",
    "this approach contrasts with that of numerical simulations with periodic boundary conditions along the jet axis , e.g. , bassett & woodward ( 1995 ) , bodo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and bodo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which focus on temporal growth .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we explain the initialization of the 3d mhd simulations , and in  3 , we discuss , in order , the growth of mass entrainment , the observational characteristics associated with mass entrainment in simulated ( radio wavelength ) intensity and polarization images , and the testing of the presence and measurable consequences of the kh instability .",
    "these simulations were performed with the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics code zeus-3d , an eulerian finite - difference code with the consistent method of characteristics ( cmoc ) that solves the transverse momentum transport and magnetic induction equations simultaneously and in a planar split fashion ( clarke 1996 ) .",
    "interpolations are carried out by a second - order accurate monotonic upwinded time - centered scheme ( van leer 1977 ) and a von neumann - richtmyer artificial viscosity is used to stabilize shocks .",
    "the code has been thoroughly tested via mhd test suites as described by stone et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and clarke ( 1996 ) to establish the reliability of the techniques .",
    "the useful computational domain for the three expanding jet simulations discussed here is a 3d cartesian grid of 325 @xmath3 130 @xmath3 130 zones , which required roughly 105 mwords of memory on the cray c90 at the pittsburgh supercomputer center ( or psc ) .",
    "the central thirty zones span the initial jet diameter , 2@xmath4 , along the transverse cartesian axes ( the @xmath5-axis and @xmath6-axis ) . outside the uniform grid zones , the grid zones are ratioed where each subsequent zone increases in size by a factor of 1.050 .",
    "the 130 transverse zones span a total distance of 30@xmath4 . along the jet or @xmath7-axis",
    ", 225 uniform zones span the interval 0 @xmath8 30 and an additional 100 ratioed zones span an additional 30@xmath4 with each subsequent zone increasing in size by a factor of 1.015 .",
    "outflow boundary conditions are used except where the jet enters the grid , where inflow boundary conditions are used .",
    "the three simulations are initialized at the inlet with parameter values similar to simulations in hcr and rhcj . specifically , simulation a here is equivalent to run c in rhcj , simulation b is equivalent to run a , and simulation c is equivalent to run e. simulations a and b contain jets that are denser than the external medium and simulation c is of a light jet .",
    "details of jet properties are listed in table [ para ] . while some simulations in rhcj had a primarily toroidal magnetic field ,",
    "all of the simulations here have a primarily axial magnetic field . limiting this study to axial field jets",
    "was done to maximize the instability of the jet , since we anticipate expanding jets to be more stable and we know that a toroidal magnetic field can have an additional stabilizing effect ( compared with a primarily axial magnetic field of the same strength , e.g. , appl & camenzind 1992 ; rhcj ) .",
    "a smaller jet velocity , @xmath9 , is used in order to reduce all of the mach numbers ( i.e. , sonic , alfvnic , and magnetosonic ) because we wish the instability to grow significantly while the jet is within the computational domain and the growth length of the instability is roughly proportional to the product of jet radius and magnetosonic mach number , with @xmath10 .",
    "the magnetosonic speed is defined as @xmath11 , where the internal jet sound speed and the alfvn speed are defined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and we assume the adiabatic gas law , @xmath14 with @xmath15 = 5/3 . we have analyzed the simulations at a somewhat later time , at @xmath16 = 45 dynamical times for simulations a and b compared with @xmath16 = 36 in rhcj and @xmath16 = 16 for simulation c compared with @xmath16 = 14 in rhcj , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the external sound speed .",
    "the jets in all of the expanding jet simulations pass through at least 3 flow - through times at @xmath7 = 50@xmath4 .",
    "each simulation required about 40 cpu - hours on the cray c90 at psc .",
    "the jet is initialized across the computational domain with a uniform density , @xmath19 , and initial radius , @xmath4 .",
    "the magnetic field within the jet is initialized with a uniform axial component , @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the radial position , and a toroidal magnetic component , @xmath23 , with a radial profile that has the form @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 is the maximum value for @xmath23 and for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and for @xmath28 , @xmath29 ^b$ ] . in these simulations",
    "@xmath30 = 1.106 and @xmath31 = 0.885 , which leads to a fwhm of the @xmath23 radial profile equal to 0.5r@xmath32 .",
    "this radial profile for @xmath23 , which sets @xmath23 to zero at @xmath33 = 0.0 and for @xmath34 0.9 , is not physically motivated , but is mathematically well - behaved . the magnetic field",
    "is set to zero in the external medium .",
    "the jet thermal pressure is initially modified to satisfy an equation of hydromagnetic equilibrium ,    @xmath35    where the term on the right hand side describes the effects of magnetic tension .",
    "note that this equilibrium condition is one of static balance , but does not necessarily lead to hydromagnetic dynamic equilibrium , which is determined by the condition @xmath36 .",
    "owing to the small toroidal field in each of these simulations , this dynamic equilibrium is nearly satisfied and we have verified that no significant azimuthal velocity occurs within the jet near the inlet .",
    "the inlet values for @xmath20 and @xmath25 are given in footnotes to table [ para ] in the units used by zeus-3d , which sets the permeability of free space to 1 . while the thermal pressure has been modified to satisfy the radial static equilibrium ,",
    "the departure from a  top hat \" pressure distribution is small .",
    "the typical plasma @xmath37 8@xmath38 is 200 in simulation a and 1.1 in simulations b and c.    in the simulations the external medium is isothermal and the external density , @xmath39 , declines to produce a pressure gradient that is designed to lead to a constant expansion , @xmath40 , of a constant velocity adiabatic jet containing a uniform axial magnetic field and an internal toroidal magnetic field that provides some confinement , i.e. ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the jet radius at axial position @xmath7 , the constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 are based on the ratios at the inlet of jet thermal pressure to magnetic pressure from the axial component ( in @xmath44 ) or from the toroidal component ( in @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 is a normalization constant equal to 1 + @xmath44 - @xmath45 .",
    "we have confirmed that the initial expansion occurs quickly , within 57 dynamical times for the dense jet simulations and 12.5 dynamical times for the light jet simulation .",
    "a difference between these simulations and their cylindrical equivalents in rhcj is a slightly reduced angular precessional frequency , @xmath47 ( see table [ prec ] ) .",
    "we decrease @xmath47 to obtain the same normalized precession frequency , @xmath48 , at some small ( but nontrivial ) distance from the inlet in each expanding jet as in the appropriate cylindrical equivalent .",
    "the spatial kh stability analysis of expanding jets suggests that at peak growth the normalized precession frequency is constant ( hardee 1986 ) ; our choice for the precession frequency , @xmath47 , is below that for peak growth , but @xmath48 will increase with jet expansion .",
    "this avoids the unresponsiveness of a jet to too high a precessional frequency .",
    "the precession is in the counterclockwise sense at the inlet and should yield a clockwise spatial helical twist when viewed downstream from the origin / inlet .",
    "the simulations are analyzed at 6.5 , 7.9 , and 3.6 precessional periods for simulations a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "another difference between the simulation sets is that the radial variation of the toroidal magnetic field component , @xmath23 , peaks at 0.5@xmath4 in the expanding jet simulations , while in all three cylindrically equivalent simulations in rhcj this maximum in @xmath23 occurred at @xmath22 = 0.8@xmath4 .",
    "however , since the toroidal field is not dynamically important in these simulations , this difference is inconsequential .",
    "since the code does not include a tracer of jet material , we use magnetic field and axial velocity criteria to estimate the mass associated with the jet plus any external medium that has been accelerated or mixed with the jet sufficiently to be called  entrained \" ( rhcj ) . such a velocity criterion has been used previously as an estimate for mass entrainment ( bassett & woodward 1995 , loken 1996 ) . since rhcj found that the choice of the magnetic field or axial velocity criteria result in similar values for the estimated jet plus entrained mass , we have chosen to use the magnetic field criterion alone in this paper . as in rhcj , we define the linear mass density , @xmath49 , at any point along the jet as    @xmath50    where a is the cross - sectional area of the computational domain at @xmath7 , and @xmath51 is a switch set to 1 if the local magnetic field is above a threshold value and @xmath51 = 0 otherwise .",
    "we set the threshold to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . in a steady expanding flow , @xmath23 varies as @xmath54 and @xmath20 varies as @xmath55 .",
    "while the choice of the 4% level is somewhat arbitrary , we believe that a threshold at this value is a useful demarkation between  mixed \" ( i.e. , jet plus entrained material ) and  unmixed \" media .",
    "the unmixed external medium may contain some small magnetic field from numerical diffusion and should not be considered as entrained . in our previous simulations , this 4% @xmath56 level corresponded to external material accelerated up to @xmath57 15% of the jet speed in the dense jets and @xmath57 4% of the jet speed in the light jet . in a smooth flow of constant jet speed without entrainment ,",
    "the linear mass density remains constant for both cylindrical and expanding jets . in what follows ,",
    "@xmath58 is the linear mass density for the axial position @xmath7 normalized to the initial jet linear mass density .",
    "we display the spatial development of @xmath58 for the expanding jet simulations and for the equivalent cylindrical jet simulations in figure [ sig ] .",
    "in addition , the bottom panel of figure [ sig ] shows the average axial velocity of the magnetized ( with @xmath59 ) material , weighted by the linear mass density ( i.e.  @xmath60 ) , along @xmath7 . from a comparison of the linear mass density in equivalent cylindrical and conical jet simulations ,",
    "the jet plus entrained mass at the @xmath61 boundary is reduced by roughly one - half in the dense jets and by at least two - thirds in the light jet ( see table [ tran ] ) .",
    "calculations of the mean density of entrained material ( see figure [ aved ] ) , which is defined as the mixed linear mass density less the initial jet linear mass density and corrected for different cross - sectional areas , shows that this mean density is similar to the initial external medium density . thus , the primary reason for the reduction in entrained mass is the reduced external density in the expanding jet simulations , which is required by total pressure balance between the expanding jet and the isothermal external medium . for the parameters that we have simulated , the reduction of @xmath49 in the expanding jets appears similar to ( for the dense jets ) or greater than ( for the light jet ) the reduction caused by changing the magnetic field configuration from primarily axial to primarily toroidal in the cylindrical jet simulations of rhcj .    in rhcj",
    ", the linear mass density plots showed regions with different rates of increase of @xmath58 with @xmath7 , which we interpreted as different mass entrainment rates .",
    "specifically , successive regions of slow , fast , and no mass entrainment ( i.e. , mass mixed with the fast moving jet as measured by our magnetic criterion ) were found , and there was evidence that the three stages of growth were associated with linear , nonlinear and saturated growth of the kh instability . in both dense jets ( simulations a and b ) , the rate of increase of linear mass density with axial position remains approximately constant for the entire range plotted .",
    "however , for @xmath62 the fluctuation of @xmath49 about this constant rate also increases with @xmath7 , which is consistent with the notion of increasingly large  gulping \" vortices , such as those discussed by deyoung ( 1996 ) , at the jet surface .",
    "this in turn is a signature of a developing kh instability . in addition",
    ", there are noticeable changes in @xmath63 near this position ( @xmath64 20 ) when the linear mass density is computed with a smaller threshold value ( i.e. , smaller than 4% ) .",
    "if the onset of the fluctuations in @xmath49 in the dense expanding jet simulations is associated with the first transition point , then the first transition points of the dense jet simulations occur at roughly the same axial positions as that of the first transition points in their cylindrical equivalents ( see table [ tran ] ) .    of the dense expanding and cylindrical jet simulations , only the linear mass density in the cylindrical equivalent to the weak field jet ( simulation a )",
    "could be interpreted as leveling off before the outer @xmath7 boundary . from our analysis of the growth of magnetized mass in the simulations here and in rhcj",
    ", we suspect that the linear mass density in the dense expanding jets would eventually saturate beyond the second transition ( saturation ) position in the cylindrical jets .",
    "if this is true , then the distance between the first and second transition points would be larger in the dense expanding jets than in their cylindrical equivalents .    in the expanding light jet ( simulation c ) , there are three regions of differing rates of increase of @xmath58 with @xmath7",
    ". estimated rates of increase are shown for the second ( fast growth ) stage in the light jet simulations in figure [ sig ] .",
    "transition points between each region are listed in table [ tran ] for the expanding and cylindrical jets simulations .",
    "the first transition point is significantly closer to the inlet in the expanding jet simulation than in the cylindrical jet simulation .",
    "since the second transition point is at roughly the same position in both the expanding and cylindrical jets , we see that the distance between the first and second transition points is larger in the expanding jet than in the cylindrical jet . as with the dense jets , the light expanding jet",
    "has a smaller spatial rate of increase of @xmath58 with @xmath7 in the fast growth region than the light cylindrical jet .",
    "we postulate that the kh instability is associated with the mass entrainment in these expanding jet simulations and compare the transition positions in table [ tran ] with estimates of the growth lengths of the kh instability determined from a linear analysis .",
    "estimated growth lengths of the helical surface wave ( @xmath65 = 1 , @xmath66 = 0 ) for both the expanding and cylindrical simulations are listed in table [ grow ] .",
    "all of these estimates are from the simple approximation for the growth length at the maximum growth rate , @xmath67 ( equation 5 in hcr ) , where @xmath68 ( equation 4a in hcr ) .",
    "note that this method consistently underestimated the values found from more sophisticated root - finding techniques for the cylindrical jet simulations in rhcj .",
    "since the growth length depends strongly on the jet radius , for the expanding jet numerical integration was used to compute the number of effective e - folding lengths , @xmath69 , such that @xmath70 ( equation [ 17 ] in hardee 1986 ) . from the smaller inlet magnetosonic mach number ,",
    "the expanding jets have a slightly smaller initial e - folding length than their cylindrical equivalents .",
    "the similar e - folding length for the expanding and cylindrical jets is consistent with the similar ( or smaller in the light expanding jet ) axial position of the first transition point .",
    "the increasing radius of an expanding jet leads to a larger distance for 5 e - foldings , which suggests that the expanding jet simulations should remain more stable farther down the grid .",
    "this greater stability is consistent with the larger distance spanned between first and second transition points in the expanding jets than in their cylindrical equivalents .",
    "the average axial velocity of the magnetized material decreases at the same rate with @xmath7 in the dense expanding jet simulations ( simulations a and b ) .",
    "this is similar to the constant rate of increase in the linear mass density , although the significant fluctuations in @xmath49 are absent in @xmath71 . in the light expanding jet ( simulation c )",
    ", there are at least three regions where the average axial velocity behaves differently , and these regions are roughly coincident with the regions of differing mass entrainment rates .",
    "specifically , there is an initial region out to @xmath72 14 where there are very small fluctuations in the average axial velocity , which changes its smooth rate of decline at @xmath73 8 . beyond this initial region with small fluctuations",
    ", there are significant fluctuations superimposed on a roughly constant decrease in the average axial velocity for 14 @xmath74 35 , and there are small fluctuations about an approximately constant @xmath71 thereafter .",
    "the greater reduction in average velocity in the light jet simulation compared with the dense jet simulations is a result of mixing of the jet with the denser external medium .",
    "the region of approximately constant @xmath71 in the light expanding jet suggests that any mixing has ceased and is consistent with the saturation of the kh instability .",
    "we calculated ( but do not show ) the transverse area covered by magnetized material with @xmath75 .",
    "in general , the area occupied by magnetized material is approximately the same for the dense expanding jets and for their cylindrical equivalents at any computed @xmath7 .",
    "the area occupied by magnetized material in the light expanding jet simulation is slightly smaller than the area of its cylindrical equivalent .",
    "therefore , the relative increase in the area occupied by magnetized material , i.e.  ( magnetized area)/(initial jet area ) , is smaller in all expanding jet simulations than in their cylindrical equivalents .",
    "this is consistent with a smaller spatial growth rate of the kh instability .",
    "in addition , we computed ( but do not show ) the linear momentum flux density , @xmath76 , of the mixed and unmixed regions .",
    "as in the trans - alfvnic jets studied in hardee & rosen ( 1999 ) , the mixed material carries the bulk of the momentum flux .",
    "the maximum momentum flux density carried by the unmixed material in any computed plane of transverse zones is about 10% of the initial jet momentum flux density for the dense jets ( simulations a and b ) and about 5% for the light jet ( simulation c ) .      in figure [ radio ]",
    "we display maps of simulated total radio intensity , which are line of sight integrations of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field ( clarke 1989 ) .",
    "such an approximation is necessary when relativistic particles are not tracked explicitly .",
    "the total intensity is integrated along the @xmath6-direction and is plotted on the @xmath79-plane in the figure . in order to compare the morphology of the images , we have used different scales in each panel of figure [ radio ] . in each panel , the range covers 3 orders of magnitude and the grayscale maximum is 20% above the actual maximum intensity .",
    "the total intensity is overlayed by b - field polarization vectors .",
    "we note that b - vectors are aligned with filaments in the intensity image , as was also the case in the simulations in rhcj . of the three jets ,",
    "the dense equipartition jet ( simulation b ) has the most obvious spine - sheath morphology in the intensity images and also maintains the spine farthest across the grid .",
    "the light jet simulation ( simulation c ) has a more uniform intensity for @xmath80 40 than the dense expanding jet simulations , which is evidence for more uniform mixing and is consistent with a saturation of the kh instability .    in the cylindrical jets studied in rhcj ,",
    "the slow , fast , and saturation stages of mass entrainment and the kh instability are associated with slow , fast , and zero expansion rates of the combined spine and sheath in the simulated intensity image .",
    "the transition points between the different expansion rates , as determined from figure [ radio ] , are listed for both the expanding jets and their cylindrical equivalents in table [ siglam ] . in the dense expanding jet simulations presented here ( simulations a and b )",
    ", a low intensity quickly expanding sheath appears at @xmath73 20 .",
    "this rapid expansion ceases for @xmath80 50 in the simulation with the stronger field ( simulation b ) , another indication of somewhat greater stability .",
    "the intensity image in simulation b appears to enter the third ( saturation ) stage although no equivalent stage for the magnetized mass ( @xmath49 ) appears on the grid ( see fig .",
    "[ sig ] ) .",
    "this suggests that this simulation continues to entrain mass for some distance beyond where the apparent expansion stops .",
    "this characteristic was seen in some of the cylindrical simulations of rhcj , although this usually occurred for light cylindrical jets . in simulations a and b , the transition points of the total intensity expansion listed in table [ siglam ] are similar to those listed for the linear mass density in table [ tran ] .",
    "we note that the fluctuations in the linear mass density may be associated with growing vortices at the jet / external medium interface , and there is evidence for such vortices in the wispy edges of the total intensity images in simulations a and b.    there are three stages of expansion in the total intensity image from the light jet simulation c ; particularly notable is the nearly constant width for @xmath80 45 .",
    "again we see a correspondence between the transition positions determined from the linear mass density and from the total intensity width . as with",
    "the transition points demarking different mass entrainment rates , the distance between the two transition points determined from the intensity images for the expanding jets is larger than the distance between the transition points for the cylindrical jets .",
    "this result is consistent with the initially shorter e - folding lengths but longer distances to 5 e - foldings on the expanding jet when compared to the cylindrical jet ( see table [ grow ] ) .",
    "thus , jet expansion has served to partially stabilize the lower magnetosonic mach number expanding jet relative to a cylindrical jet and the total intensity images show observational consequences of this stabilization .      in this subsection , we compare wavelengths and wave speeds measured in the simulations with those expected from a linear analysis of kh induced modes .",
    "subsequently , we examine the effect of the kh instability on the fluting of the jet surface via axial velocity cross - sections and on internal structure via axial cuts of each velocity component .      from the oscillations observed in the intensity images ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] ) , we estimate the wavelength of the surface helical mode , @xmath81 , to be : in simulation a , 15@xmath4 ; in b , 13@xmath4 ; and in c , 18@xmath4 . the error in this estimate",
    "is roughly 10% .",
    "we measured these wavelengths in a region centered on @xmath82 = 25 in simulations a and b , and @xmath82 = 20 in simulation c ; recall that the wavelength at maximum growth should be proportional to the jet radius .",
    "the expanding jets have a smaller precessional frequency , a lower jet velocity and a different wave speed than their cylindrical equivalents .",
    "these factors combine to give similar wavelengths in the expanding jets and their cylindrical equivalents ( see table [ siglam ] ) .",
    "if the observed wavelength of a mode is much larger than the wavelength associated with peak growth , @xmath83 , then the wave speed should be roughly @xmath84",
    ". however , if @xmath85 , the wave speed approximations for peak growth are more appropriate , and the wave speed should be @xmath86 ( e.g. , hardee 1987 , and hcr ) . from the approximation ( 4b ) in hcr for the wavelength at maximum growth , we estimate in simulations a and b at @xmath82 = 30 that @xmath87 and in simulation c at the same position @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the measured wavelengths indicate that the wave speed in these simulations should be @xmath89 . assuming that the initial values for the external density and the jet densities follow from the expected expansion , this approximation yields the wave speeds given in table [ wavesp ] .",
    "these wave speeds are consistent with wave speeds estimated from the product of the observed helical mode wavelength and the driving frequency , @xmath90 ( also in table [ wavesp ] ) .    in order to calculate the wave speed directly",
    ", we measure the movement over time of maxima in axial profiles of the simulated total intensity images ( figure [ intpro ] ) .",
    "the linear analysis approximation for wave speed suggests that the wave speed should increase only moderately with @xmath7 in the dense jet simulations . on the other hand , the wave speed should increase more dramatically in the light jet simulation .",
    "specifically , in the weak magnetic field dense jet ( simulation a ) , the wave speed increases from @xmath91 at @xmath64 15 to @xmath92 in the 25 @xmath74 40 interval . in the more strongly magnetized dense jet ( simulation b ) , the wave speed increases from @xmath93 at @xmath94 to @xmath95 for 30 @xmath74 50 .",
    "thus , the wave speed in the dense jets increases by roughly 1020% over this range of axial positions .",
    "in contrast , in the light jet simulation the wave speed increases from @xmath96 at @xmath64 15 to @xmath97 at @xmath64 30 .",
    "the large wave speed , which occurs where the kh instability has reached nonlinear proportions , does not increase much beyond this axial position .",
    "it is likely that this constant wave speed is related to saturation of the kh instability ( as inferred from the saturation in the linear mass density and the constant apparent width of the intensity image ) for @xmath80 40 .",
    "the measured wavelengths and wave speeds , except where the amplitude of the kh instability has grown beyond the linear approximation , are consistent with those estimated from the linear analysis of the kh instability .",
    "thus , we conclude that the kh instability is responsible for the growth of mass entrainment in these simulations .",
    "the growth of the kh instability and its effect on the jet is dramatically demonstrated in the grayscale cross - sections of axial velocity from simulations a , b , and c in figure [ cross ] . as observed in magnetic pressure cross - sections in previous simulations ( rhcj ) ,",
    "there are many corrugations in the fast moving surface at @xmath98 15 in all three simulations . that the many corrugations are roughly evenly spaced circumferentially on the jet is evidence for the surface waves of high order fluting modes . in all the simulations here and in simulations in rhcj ,",
    "the higher order modes that dominate close to the inlet are overwhelmed by the larger distortion amplitudes accompanying the slower growing , lower order modes farther down the jet . in figure",
    "[ cross ] the helical mode appears as the clockwise motion of the jet center about the initial jet axis as one moves down the jet .",
    "this clockwise rotation about the jet axis provides an additional estimate for the wavelength of the helical mode . in the light jet simulation , @xmath99 between @xmath100 , where much of the jet is to the left of the original jet axis , and @xmath101 , where the jet has been displaced to the upper right",
    "this wavelength is consistent with the very large wave speed ( @xmath102 = 7.6 ) measured at large @xmath82 .",
    "there is also a correspondence between features in the intensity images and the axial velocity cross - sections .",
    "recall that the simulated intensity images are integrated along the @xmath6 axis and the observer in figure [ radio ] is to the right in figure [ cross ] . for the light expanding jet simulation",
    ", a spine - sheath morphology is more evident in the cross - sections than in the intensity images .",
    "however , far from the inlet the area of the high @xmath103 material is smaller than for the dense expanding jets .",
    "this is another indication of greater mixing occurring in the light jet simulation .",
    "the effect of the kh instability on the internal structure of the jets is demonstrated by the one - dimensional cuts of velocity components along the jet axis ( @xmath104 = 0 ) shown in figure [ axis ] . in all three simulations , the variation in the axial velocity component is initially small , @xmath105 2% .",
    "at some point the variation grows to significant amplitude relatively abruptly . for the dense jet simulations this occurs at @xmath64 22 , and for the light jet simulation this occurs at @xmath64 15 .",
    "these positions are close to the first transition point ( in either magnetized mass or width of the simulated intensity image ) in all three jets .",
    "thus , changes in the nature of the mass entrainment rate associated with the growth of the kh instability are able to affect the jet dynamics significantly",
    ".    continued growth of the kh instability as illustrated by axial profiles of @xmath103 differs in the dense jet simulations beyond the first transition point .",
    "specifically , there are significant oscillations of @xmath103 in simulation a for 20 @xmath74 42 , but oscillations in simulation b remain relatively small out to @xmath106 47 .",
    "the smaller variations in the more strongly magnetized jet imply greater stability . in the light jet simulation",
    ", there is an additional , extremely abrupt ( 0.75@xmath9 ) decrease in @xmath103 at @xmath106 31 .",
    "examination of the axial velocity cross - sections in figure [ cross ] reveals that this extremely abrupt drop in axial velocity in the light jet simulation is created as the small high velocity spine is displaced off the axis by the helical mode of the kh instability , and is not associated with the onset of the plateau in the jet plus entrained mass .",
    "the second transition position in the light jet does coincide with the reappearance of the @xmath103 maxima in figure [ axis ] .    in the dense jet simulations the transverse velocity components show a noticeable relative phase shift in the region 10 @xmath107 30 .",
    "we consider the maximum in @xmath108 at @xmath109 10 in simulation a to be a precursor of , and therefore connected to , the maxima in @xmath110 at @xmath109 21 and in @xmath108 at @xmath64 23 .",
    "the phase shift is more easily seen in the more strongly magnetized jet ( simulation b ) , with extrema in @xmath110 at @xmath109 12 , 18 , and 23 repeated in @xmath108 at @xmath109 13 , 21 , and 25 . in the light jet simulation , the evidence for a relative phase shift between the transverse velocity components is less obvious , but perhaps the maximum in @xmath110 at @xmath109 7 contributes to the maximum in @xmath108 at @xmath111 10 . in all of the simulations ,",
    "the extent of the region where the phase shift is noticeable is related to the growth of the helical mode of the kh instability : the region begins where the fluctuations in transverse velocity reach a significant amplitude and ends where the displacement from the kh instability has become significant . where noticeable , @xmath108 is shifted farther down the jet than @xmath110 .",
    "such a sequence is in the sense of a clockwise spatial variation when viewed toward + @xmath7 from the inlet and consistent with the counterclockwise temporal precession at the inlet described in  2 .",
    "this phase shift is additional evidence for a significant presence of the helical kh mode .",
    "the magnetized , or jet plus entrained , mass in these expanding jet simulations increases more slowly than in their cylindrical equivalents .",
    "this reduction in the mass entrainment is a direct consequence of the reduced external mass density , which is required by an expanding pressure - matched jet . for the parameters that we have simulated",
    ", the reduction of magnetized mass in the expanding jet simulations appears similar to ( for the dense jets ) or greater than ( for the light jet ) the reduction caused by changing the magnetic field configuration from primarily axial to primarily toroidal in the cylindrical jet simulations of rhcj .",
    "thus , a conical jet appears more stable than its cylindrical equivalent , and should be considered , along with relativistic jets ( hardee et al .",
    "1998 ; and hughes , miller , & duncan 1999 ) , as another stabilizing influence in the propagation of astrophysical jets .    as in the cylindrical jet simulations , the spatial development of the magnetized mass passes through different stages , in which the spatial rate of increase of magnetized mass or the smoothness of this increase is different .",
    "we see evidence for a first transition , between a region of a nearly constant increase in magnetized mass and a more varied increase in magnetized mass in the dense jets . in the light jet simulation",
    "this first transition occurs between a region with a slow increase in magnetized mass to one with a faster increase .",
    "also , in the light jet simulation we see a second transition , between the region of fast increase and a region where the magnetized mass remains relatively constant . in the expanding jet simulations",
    "the distance between first and second transition points is similar to or larger than this distance in the cylindrical jet equivalent simulations .",
    "the observed behavior is consistent with slower growth of the kh instability on expanding jets relative to cylindrical jets .",
    "thus , we confirm the theoretical prediction that the kh instability grows on these expanding jets at a reduced rate relative to an equivalent cylindrical jet .",
    "previous work ( rhcj ) associated the different stages of spatial development with the linear , nonlinear , and saturated stages of the kh instability , and this appears to be the case in these expanding jet simulations .",
    "the simulations also contain wavelengths and wave speeds that are consistent with theoretical estimates of the wavelengths and wave speeds appropriate to the surface helical mode wave triggered at the precession frequency .",
    "simulated intensity images also reveal three stages in the expansion of the mixed jet and entrained material .",
    "these stages are similar ( slow , fast , and zero expansion ) and roughly coincident with the three stages of mass entrainment .",
    "however , in one case the jet continues to entrain mass while maintaining a constant jet width in the intensity image .",
    "the reduced kh instability growth rate in expanding jets does result in a lengthening span between transition points as determined from the intensity image relative to transition points for cylindrical equivalent jets .",
    "our present study confirms results from rhcj .",
    "the simulated total radio intensity images and the axial velocity transverse cross - sections show that dense jets are able to maintain a high velocity spine as part of a spine / sheath structure .",
    "we also see an alignment of polarization vectors with filaments in the simulated intensity images .",
    "in addition , the transverse cross - sections show a progression from high order , fast growing , small amplitude to low order , slower growing , large amplitude kh modes .",
    "axial cuts of each velocity component show that the internal structure exhibits a transition in the growth of the instability in roughly the same position as the first transition point in the mass entrainment rate or in the width of the intensity images . beyond this transition point , especially in the light jet simulation , the displacement of the jet from the initial axis complicates the profile .                                                      ccccccccccc a & 4.00 & w & 0.995 & 0.50 & 0.04 & 0.50 &  3.49 &  7.00 & 93.1   & 6.98 b & 4.00 & e & 0.54   & 0.37 & 0.38 & 0.52 &  3.67 & 10.00 &  9.80 & 7.00 c & 0.25 & e & 0.54   & 1.47 & 1.50 & 2.10 & 11.17 &  7.60 &  7.45 & 5.32"
