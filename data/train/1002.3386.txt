    "this discrepancy has been interpreted as a manifestation of the missing meson cloud effects in the models  @xcite .",

    "the model has been applied successfully for the studies of spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 low - lying baryons  @xcite .",

    ", we have estimated the meson cloud contributions for the dirac ( @xmath20 ) and pauli ( @xmath21 ) type transition form factors .",
    "a characteristic feature of the model , @xmath87 , is a direct consequence of the orthogonality condition between the nucleon and the roper states .",
    "however , this may not have significant consequences in the estimate of the meson cloud contributions , since they appear to be dominant at low @xmath4 , or conversely , the valence quark contributions are expected to be small at @xmath12  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have shown that the transition form factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the @xmath2 reaction may be more suitable quantities to study than the helicity amplitudes in order to disentangle the meson cloud contributions .",
    "for example , @xmath124 is small for both in experimental data and the valence quark model because of the cancellation between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 amplitudes .",
    "this implies also the meson cloud contributions are small . as for @xmath21 ,",
    "it is mainly determined by @xmath42 in the very low @xmath4 region , which measures the meson cloud contributions in our approach ( for @xmath38 ) .",
    "we admit that our estimate of the meson cloud contributions has some limitations due to the parameterization of the amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 based on the maid analysis .",
    "furthermore , we have faced that there are some discrepancies between the two data sets of the clas and maid in the high @xmath4 region .",
    "more precision experimental data in this high @xmath4 region are desired to constrain better the meson cloud contributions .    for a possible improvement",
    ", there is a room to add one extra free parameter to the model .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 ( fixed by the nucleon wave function ) in the factor @xmath134 in the roper wave function , can be replaced by a new free parameter @xmath135 to introduce a new long range scale , and may be adjusted by more precise , high @xmath4 data .",
    "needless to say , more lattice qcd data are also useful to constrain the valence quark contributions better .",
    "we plan to extend the present model for higher mass resonance region , like for instance , @xmath136 . in the past dynamical coupled - channel models",
    "are very successful in the description of the meson - baryon electro- and photoreaction , involving resonances such as @xmath137 , @xmath3 and @xmath136 .",
    "however , such models require a parameterization in the interaction with the quark core . in general",
    ", it is based on the baryon - meson phenomenology and not based on the quark ( and gluon ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the approach developed in this work is very promising to study the valence quark contributions in the meson - baryon systems",
    ". it can be tested , or compared with the bare parameters used in the dynamical coupled - channel models .",
    "an independent test may be to compare with the bare contributions ( no meson cloud ) determined by dynamical meson - baryon coupled - channel models by fitting e.g. , to the cross section data at each @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this kind of an extraction of the bare contributions was done for the @xmath108 reaction  @xcite , as well as other resonances including the roper  @xcite .",
    "however , often the meson cloud contributions become larger than the quark core contributions , and an estimate of the bare contributions are sometimes difficult to get as a smooth function of @xmath4 .",
    "another possible method is to use the lattice qcd data in the heavy - pion regime to fix the valence quark contributions .",
    "this method was successfully applied in ref .",
