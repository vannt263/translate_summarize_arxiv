    "the radio emission of jets in the hard state of black - hole binaries and of extragalactic parsec - scale radio sources is often flat in the @xmath5 representation , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the photon energy , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the emission of this type of jet is usually interpreted as due to the partially self - absorbed synchrotron process in a continuous conical jet ( @xcite , hereafter bk79 ) .",
    "the emission at a given energy is self - absorbed from its onset up to a certain height of @xmath9 , and it is optically thin at higher @xmath10 .",
    "the jet becomes optically thin at all @xmath11 at energies above the synchrotron break energy , @xmath12 .",
    "the model of bk79 is also assumed in an important method of measuring magnetic fields of extragalactic jets from core shifts , i.e. , angular displacements with frequency of the observed maxima of jet radio emission @xcite .",
    "this method can also be used to measure the jet power @xcite .    the angular emissivity pattern of such continuous , partially optically - thick , jets differs from that of optically - thin jets , either steady - state or in the form of moving blobs @xcite .",
    "the case of the angular dependence of the emission from partially self - absorbed jets was considered by @xcite . here ,",
    "we re - examine this problem , and obtain different results at viewing angles close to the jet axis .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is that the usual approximation that we view the jet from a side in the comoving frame breaks down in that case .",
    "we also consider implications of our results for the ratio of the jet - to - counterjet emission .",
    "we then apply our results to the compact radio jet observed from cyg x-1 in its hard spectral state .",
    "the angles in the comoving frame , @xmath13 , are shown for the jet and counterjet by the solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "the top solid and bottom dashed ( red ) and the two middle ( black ) curves are for @xmath14 and 5/3 ( @xmath15 ) , respectively .",
    "we see that at large @xmath3 , the jet - frame viewing angle for most values of @xmath16 is close to @xmath17 . ]     from the origin , and at the radial distance @xmath18 from the jet axis .",
    ", width=283 ]    we develop here the formalism of @xcite , hereafter zls12 .",
    "we use the notation similar to that of zls12 , except that now the doppler factor is @xmath19 , the dimensionless jet length , @xmath20 , is in units of the distance of the position of the onset of the synchrotron emission , @xmath21 , as in @xcite , and we take into account the effect of cosmological redshift , which we denote as @xmath22 .",
    "also , the jet radius is given now accurately as @xmath23 rather than by @xmath24 , where @xmath11 is the distance from the jet origin and @xmath25 is the half - opening angle .",
    "we consider the model of a conical jet moving with a constant bulk velocity , @xmath26 , and emitting synchrotron radiation ( bk79 ) .",
    "we are concerned with the angular distribution of the emission of such jets .",
    "we observe the jet at an angle , @xmath16 , with respect to the jet axis .",
    "this angle in the jet frame is given by @xmath27 where @xmath3 is the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the counterjet is viewed at @xmath28 .",
    "examples of the relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath13 are shown in fig .",
    "[ transform ] .",
    "we see that at large @xmath3 , the jet - frame viewing angle for most values of @xmath16 is close to @xmath17 .",
    "the jet is viewed at @xmath29 in the jet frame for @xmath30 , see case ( iii ) in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] . this case is also equivalent to @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "hereafter , we omit primes for other quantities in the comoving frame , and use a prime instead for quantities being integrated .",
    "we note , however , that unlike the case of a moving blob of a constant size , often assumed to model blazars , the comoving frame in our case is not stationary .",
    "both the distance from the origin and the radius increase with time in the comoving frame , and the magnetic field and the electron density decrease with time .",
    "thus , a photon directed at @xmath29 in the comoving frame moves in a changing environment , in spite of its comoving position being constant .",
    "therefore , we perform our calculations in the observer frame , in which the jet is stationary ( though its medium is moving ) .",
    "we do it using the emission and absorption coefficients transformed from the comoving frame , see below .",
    "the steady - state electron distribution per unit volume in the comoving frame at a given point ( defined in the observer frame ) is assumed to be a of a power - law form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the normalization and @xmath35 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "following bk79 , we assume conservation of the electron distribution along the jet , and conservation of the energy flux in the toroidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "we also define the dimensional energy , @xmath8 , in the observer s frame and a dimensionless one , @xmath36 , in the jet frame .",
    "thus , we have @xmath37 where @xmath21 corresponds to the onset of emission .    for calculation of the synchrotron emission and absorption , we assume the magnetic field is tangled @xcite , which implies the emission in the local frame is isotropic . the emission coefficient from isotropic relativistic power - law electrons per unit volume at the jet frame can then be written as , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the critical magnetic field , @xmath40 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath41 is the electron charge , and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) follows from averaging over the pitch angle , see , e.g. , zls12 .",
    "the emission coefficient in the local observer frame at @xmath8 equals @xmath45 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption coefficient averaged over the pitch angle for a power - law electron distribution can be expressed as , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fine - structure constant , and the constant @xmath48 ( @xmath49 for @xmath44 ) is given , e.g. , in zls12 .",
    "the absorption coefficient in the local observer frame at @xmath8 equals @xmath50 .",
    "the source function , @xmath51 , is then , @xmath52 which becomes @xmath53 in the observer frame .",
    "in order to obtain the spectrum observed from the jet , we need to calculate the emission towards the observer from a given location of the jet in the observer frame and then integrate it over the jet projected area .",
    "we can do it by integrating the radiative transfer equation over the line of sight , e.g. , equation ( 1.29 ) in @xcite , and then integrate the solution over the projected area . in the conical geometry and for an arbitrary angle , this can be done only numerically , which we do in appendix [ exact ] . however ,",
    "if the viewing angle in the observer frame is @xmath54 , see the case ( iii ) in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , we can approximate the jet locally as a cylinder , and neglect the variation of @xmath34 and @xmath55 along the line of sight .",
    "the above approximation also implies that the source function is constant along the line of sight . in this approximation",
    ", the radiative transfer equation solves for the observed intensity as @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath57 is the optical depth to synchrotron self - absorption integrated over the entire line of sight , @xmath58^{1/2 } , \\label{tau1}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the distance perpendicular to both the jet axis and the line of sight . the flux ( for either jet or counterjet )",
    "is then given by ( zls12 ) @xmath60 , \\label{int1}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the luminosity distance .",
    "since uppermost parts of the jet usually contribute weakly to the total flux , we assume here the jet extends to infinity .",
    "hereafter , the redshift terms are included , generalizing the corresponding equations in zls12 .",
    "the unit of energy in the flux is assumed to be the same as the unit of photon energy ( e.g. , both can be in ev or erg ) , which results in the unit of the flux of @xmath62 s@xmath63 . to get the flux in , e.g. , erg and the photon energy in ev , we need to multiply the above formula by erg / ev .",
    "above the synchrotron break energy , @xmath12 , see equation ( [ break1 ] ) below , the entire jet emission is optically thin , with @xmath64 .",
    "below it , the jet is optically thick from @xmath21 up to some distance , and optically thin above it .",
    "this results in the spectral index of the partially optically thick spectrum of @xmath65 regardless of @xmath66 ( as obtained by bk79 ) . in order to get the normalization of this spectrum",
    ", we can solve equation ( [ int1 ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to substituting equation ( 23 ) in equation ( 22 ) of zls12 , which yields @xmath67 which is valid for @xmath68 .",

    "example values of @xmath72 are @xmath73 , 2.10 , 1.61 for @xmath74 , 3 , 4 , respectively .",
    "the flux dependence on the angle is @xmath75 , see also @xcite .",
    "this can be compared to the angular dependence of a steady - state optically - thin jet of @xmath76 ( bk79 ; @xcite ) for @xmath65 .",
    "we see that at large angles the two dependencies are relatively similar , having similar powers of @xmath19 , e.g. , 13/6 and 16/7 for the partially optically - thick jet with @xmath74 , 3 , respectively , vs.  2 for an optically thin jet . however , at small viewing angles we have @xmath77 , which leads to a strong reduction of the flux , formally to null at @xmath78",
    ".    however , we point out that the approximation of equation ( [ int1 ] ) breaks down when the viewing angle is substantially different from @xmath29 , in particular for @xmath79 or @xmath80 , see fig .",
    "[ geometry ] . this is because a given line of sight goes through regions with variable magnetic field and the electron normalization , and @xmath81 is no longer constant along it .",
    "furthermore , the length along a line of sight is no longer given by that in a cylinder , which is assumed in equation ( [ tau1 ] ) .",
    "generally , the integration of the attenuated source function over the jet volume needs to be done numerically , see appendix [ exact ] .",
    "furthermore , the treatment needs to be changed for @xmath82 , in which case we no longer see the jet side , but instead view it from the top .",
    "an analogous effect occurs for the bottom view .",
    "these cases require a change of the method of the integration of the radiative transfer solution over the projected area ( appendix [ exact ] ) .",
    "thus , the question arises whether the angular dependence dominated by the above power of @xmath83 actually takes place . in order to address this question ,",
    "we consider the limiting approximation in which we view the jet at @xmath78 , see case ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "a conical jet has divergent velocities , see , e.g. , @xcite , which effect we neglect , and assume that @xmath78 along all the lines of sight through the jet .",
    "we note that the entire emission originating at a given distance , @xmath11 , is now attenuated by the same optical depth , corresponding to the positions @xmath84 .",
    "thus , we can simplify the radiative transfer equation for this case and multiply the source function by the jet cross section , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the jet radius .",
    "we can then write the radiative transfer equation directly for the flux , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is measured from the top of the jet down to the intersection of the line of sight with the jet boundary ( at @xmath89 ) .",
    "uppermost parts of the jet contribute weakly to the total emission , as well as the part closest to the jet origin are strongly self - absorbed , which is the case for photon energies well below the synchrotron break , @xmath12 , see below .",
    "thus we calculate the above integral from 0 to @xmath90 .",
    "( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the blue dotted curve shows the distributions for an optically thin steady - state jet , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "the red solid curve shows the exact dependence for a partially optically - thick jet , see appendix [ exact ] , for @xmath74 and @xmath93 .",
    "this dependence reaches the value of the small - angle limit of equation ( [ onaxis ] ) at @xmath78 .",
    "the black dashed curve shows the cylindrical approximation of equation ( [ thick ] ) , which is exact at @xmath29 , but it breaks down at small angles .",

    "then , we express the jet opening angle as a fraction of @xmath115 , @xmath116 . in theoretical models ,",

    "the total emission is , obviously , the sum of the fluxes from the jet and the counterjet .",

    "we can still use the approximation of a ray along the jet axis , but the direction of the emission is opposite .",

    "naturally , equation ( [ flux_cj ] ) with a replacement of @xmath152 also gives the jet emission at @xmath147 .",
    "we also note that we have neglected here a possible ( and likely in a range of angles ) obscuration of the counterjet emission at @xmath79 , by the accretion disc and stellar wind .",
    "also , the jet will synchrotron - absorbed reprocess the counterjet synchrotron emission .",

    "this approximation implies that the flux becomes null when the jet is viewed on axis , with @xmath95 , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "as stated in section [ jet ] , we first obtain the intensity emitted by a given point of the jet projection in a given direction , and then integrate it over the projected area . in order to efficiently deal with the geometry of an inclined cone and its projection , we set up two coordinate systems in the observer frame .",
    "one is the usual jet coordinate system , with the @xmath11 axis along the jet axis , and the @xmath59 and @xmath176 axes orthogonal to it .",
    "the other system has the origin at the top of the jet , at the height @xmath177 , at @xmath178 in the jet coordinates , and it is rotated clockwise by the viewing angle , @xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to an anticlockwise rotation of the jet itself . since the optically - thin jet emission declines fast with the distance , the results are almost independent of the assumed value of @xmath177 as long as it is much larger than the height at which the emission at a given frequency becomes optically thin .",
    "the coordinates in the rotated system are marked by the subscript @xmath16 .",
    "the transformations from the jet system to the rotated one and the reverse one are @xmath179 respectively , where @xmath180 is the three - dimensional clockwise rotation matrix fixing the @xmath59 axis .    the way we calculate the intensity depends on the viewing direction . for viewing from either the top or the side , @xmath181 , @xmath57",
    "is taken to be 0 when the ray leaves the jet , and integrated backward to its maximum value at the ray origin .",
    "for viewing the jet from the back , we follow the usual convention of the radiative transfer , and take @xmath57 to be 0 at the origin and integrate it to its maximum value at which the ray leaves the jet .",
    "this corresponds to the expressions for the intensity in the jet frame ( see section [ def ] ) of @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the running length measured along the ray .",
    "we then change the variable of integration from @xmath183 to the height , @xmath11 , measured in the jet coordinates as it is the only geometric quantity that the source and absorption functions vary with , the other quantities being constant .",

    "a given a point , @xmath192 , in the jet coordinates and the viewing angle , @xmath16 , we can define a straight line at that angle that passes through the point .",
    "we need to find the intersections of this line with the cone , given by @xmath193 the intersections with the cone can be found by squaring both sides and solving the resulting quadratic equation .",
    "however , squaring the equation for the cone also gives us a second cone flipped over the @xmath59-@xmath176 plane ( the counterjet ) .",
    "when the viewing angle is less than the jet opening angle , the first intersection is on the second cone and when it is greater than @xmath194 , the second intersection will be on the second cone , so the functions are assigned the value of infinity at these angles so that these cases can be separated .",

    "is difficult but it is easy to find where the base of the jet is in the rotated coordinate system .",
