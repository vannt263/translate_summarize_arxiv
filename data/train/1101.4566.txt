    "the study of large deviation functions has been of increasing importance for the understanding of many - body systems . on the one hand",
    "large deviation functions form the basis of a modern approach to equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite , on the other hand they are increasingly recognized of being of fundamental interest for the characterization of non - equilibrium systems where they are sometimes considered to play a role similar to that played by the free energy at equilibrium .",
    "important examples are given by the large deviations of the steady - state currents @xcite in systems that are far from equilibrium .",
    "recently , mehl _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended the study of large deviation functions far from equilibrium to the steady - state entropy production . studying a one - dimensional system composed of a single particle driven along a periodic potential , they reformulated the problem as a time - independent eigenvalue problem @xcite and showed that for this system the large deviation function of the entropy production exhibits a kink at zero entropy production .",
    "similar kinks in the large deviation function of the entropy production or in related large deviation functions of other quantities can also be found in a range of other systems @xcite .",
    "these are intriguing results that raise the important question whether the presence of this kink is a universal feature of systems with non - equilibrium steady states .    in this paper",
    "we study the entropy production in the steady states of different non - equilibrium interacting many - body systems .",
    "on the one hand we study the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) @xcite , a transport process in an open system where particles can enter or leave only at the system boundaries .",
    "on the other hand we investigate reaction - diffusion systems on a ring where the number of particles can change everywhere in the system due to reactions between the particles .",
    "our main emphasis thereby is on the entropy production in the long - time limit where we study the large deviation function in the same way as done by mehl _",
    "_ in their study of the single particle system",
    ". for all studied many - body systems we find a kink - like feature at zero entropy production , similar to what has been observed for the single particle system .",
    "we show that this kink is a generic feature in non - equilibrium systems obeying a detailed fluctuation theorem for the entropy production .",
    "it is worth noting that large deviation functions of the _ current _ have been studied previously in some related systems .",
    "studies of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite and of the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) @xcite revealed a non - analytical behavior of the current large deviation function at the value 0 of the parameter that is canonically conjugated to the particle current . using dynamical renormalization group techniques",
    ", it was later shown that the value of the corresponding exponent follows from the noise renormalization @xcite . very recently ,",
    "bodineau and lagouge @xcite studied the current large deviations in a driven dissipative lattice gas model with creation and annihilation processes , whereas simon @xcite investigated the large deviation function of the current for the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we introduce our models , before discussing in section iii our approaches for computing the entropy production at short times as well as the mean entropy production rate and the large deviation function for the entropy production in the long - time limit .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in section iv .",
    "finally , section v gives our conclusions .",
    "in order to elucidate the entropy production in interacting many - body systems , we discuss in the following reaction - diffusion systems on a ring as well as open transport systems where particles move through a system that they can enter or leave only at its boundaries . in the past , due to the combination of their conceptual simplicity and highly non - trivial results , diffusion - limited reaction systems @xcite and simple exclusion processes @xcite have greatly contributed to our understanding of processes far from equilibrium .",
    "for the same reasons , these models are also the natural choices for our study of the entropy production in many - body systems .    as reaction - diffusion systems we consider simple cases where particles @xmath0 diffuse on a one - dimensional ring , under the condition that every lattice site can only be simply occupied .",
    "this diffusion process is mimicked by the hopping of a particle to an empty nearest neighbor site with rate @xmath1 . in addition , we also allow for particle creation and annihilation . in the creation process",
    "a new particle can be created at an empty site with rate @xmath2 , whereas in the annihilation process @xmath3 particles on @xmath3 connected sites are destroyed with rate @xmath4 , yielding @xmath3 empty sites . in the following",
    "we characterize our models by the number of particles involved in the annihilation process and call @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) the model where @xmath3 particles are destroyed . as a variant , we also study the situation ( we call the resulting model @xmath7 ) where in a two particles reaction only one particle is destroyed .",
    "these models are the same as those studied in @xcite in order to better understand steady - state and transient properties of reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "all these systems have non - equilibrium steady states . in addition ,",
    "some or all reactions do not allow for a direct back - reaction , and microscopic reversibility is broken .",
    "however , as discussed in the next section , the computation of the entropy production requires microscopic reversibility , i.e. for every reaction the direct back - reaction must be possible .",
    "for that reason we are adding to the reaction schemes the direct back - reactions of the reactions just described .",
    "thus , any particle can be destroyed with rate @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , irrespective of whether neighboring sites are occupied or not , and a reversing of the annihilation process yields the creation of particles with rate @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that even with these expanded reaction schemes our systems are still characterized by non - equilibrium steady states , as long as @xmath12 . in the following we set @xmath13 and focus on the case @xmath14 . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we summarize the different reaction schemes in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".the different reaction schemes discussed in this work .",

[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as transport process we consider the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) where every configuration is reversible . in the total asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in an open one - dimensional system , particles that are fed into the system at , say , the left end with rate @xmath17 can leave the system at the right end with rate @xmath18 . inside the system particles can only jump to a right neighboring site , provided that site is not occupied .",
    "obviously , microscopic reversibility is always broken for this model . in the pasep ,",
    "however , particles can always jump in both directions , provided that the chosen site is empty , with the probability for a jump to the right being @xmath19 , whereas the probability for a jump to the left is @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , particles can exit the system at the left with probability @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) and enter at the right with probability @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) .",
    "it follows that microscopic reversibility is always fulfilled . in order to keep the number of parameters as small as possible , we set @xmath25 , with @xmath14 .",
    "whereas our main focus in the following will be on the large deviation function of the steady - state entropy production in the long time limit , we will also briefly discuss the entropy production at short times .",
    "focusing on our lattice models , let us consider a path in configuration space @xmath26 that starts at some configuration @xmath27 and ends at some configuration @xmath28 after @xmath29 diffusion or reaction steps .",
    "every configuration @xmath30 is uniquely characterized by the occupation numbers ( being 0 or 1 ) of all lattice sites .",
    "we will denote by @xmath31 the probability to find the configuration @xmath30 in the steady state . with",

    "the boundary term , @xmath41 , which can be neglected in the long time limit , needs to be included when investigating fluctuation relations of the entropy production at short times .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ent_prod ] ) the transition rates from configuration @xmath33 to @xmath30 and from configuration @xmath30 to @xmath33 are showing up together .",

    "it is the value of @xmath67 that characterizes this intriguing behavior of the large deviation function of the entropy production .",
    "a larger value of @xmath67 yields a more pronounced feature and a sharper and higher peak in the second derivative of the large deviation function .",

    "indeed , in that case one can fit the largest eigenvalue and the large deviation function to the quadratic forms ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) , thereby obtaining an excellent agreement .",
    "however , a closer look at the second derivative , see fig .",
    "[ fig7]d and [ fig7]e , reveals that qualitatively the case @xmath103 does _ not _ differ from the other cases : the second derivative exhibits a maximum at @xmath91 which is the signature of the kink - like feature .",

    "the kink - like feature might no longer be easily detectable by simple inspection of @xmath92 in systems where the entropy production approaches a nearly gaussian form , but it still reveals itself in a maximum in @xmath104 .    from our study , as well as from the observation of kink - like features in other systems fulfilling the fluctuation theorem , we can therefore conclude that this behavior is generic for non - equilibrium systems .",
    "our study of interacting many - body systems has yielded two main results regarding the entropy production in the steady states of non - equilibrium systems .    on the one hand",
    ", we showed that the kink observed in the entropy production large deviation function at zero entropy production is generic and directly follows from the fluctuation theorem .",

    "( [ eq : chip_ft1 ] ) and ( [ eq : chip_ft2 ] ) .",
    "it follows that the kink is characterized by the value of the mean entropy production rate in the steady state .    on the other hand ,",

    "<S> entropy production is one of the most important characteristics of non - equilibrium steady states . </S>",
    "<S> we study here the steady - state entropy production , both at short times as well as in the long - time limit , of two important classes of non - equilibrium systems : transport systems and reaction - diffusion systems . </S>",
    "<S> the usefulness of the mean entropy production rate and of the large deviation function of the entropy production for characterizing non - equilibrium steady states of interacting many - body systems is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the large deviation function displays a kink - like feature at zero entropy production that is similar to that observed for a single particle driven along a periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> this kink is a direct consequence of the detailed fluctuation theorem fulfilled by the probability distribution of the entropy production and is therefore a generic feature of the corresponding large deviation function . </S>"
