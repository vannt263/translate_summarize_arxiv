    "microscopic theories of low - energy nuclear structure arguably began with the realization that one could base nuclear wavefunctions on an _ independent particle model _ ( ipm ) , with the crucial proviso that one has a strong spin - orbit force .",
    "the ipm was motivated by filled shells ( ` magic numbers ' ) and by the magnetic moments of nuclei with one particle outside or one hole in a closed shell @xcite . even today",
    "many high - end methods for _ ab initio _ nuclear structure , such as green s function monte carlo @xcite , coupled - clusters @xcite , and the no - core shell model @xcite , use the ipm as a starting point , although each go far beyond it .    because the nuclear hamiltonian is rotationally invariant",
    ", total angular momentum @xmath4 is a good quantum number ( as is the third or @xmath5 component , @xmath6 ) . in the nuclear ipm , despite the lack of a core as in atomic physics , one uses an average or mean potential , typically one which is rotationally invariant , to construct the single - particle states .",
    "these single - particle states have good orbital angular momentum @xmath7 and intrinsic spin @xmath8 , which for electrons and for nucleons is @xmath9 , and following the rules for addition of quantized angular momentum @xcite , symbolized by @xmath10 , one can combine these into the total angular momentum for a single particle , @xmath11 single particle states which are degenerate or nearly so are grouped together into shells , and the ipm is often called the _ non - interacting shell model_.    for atoms , with weak coupling between orbital angular momentum and spin , single - particle states with the same @xmath7 but different @xmath0 are nearly degenerate . in that case",
    "it makes sense , to follow @xmath3-@xmath2 or russell - saunders coupling and couple together all the individual orbital angular momenta for @xmath12 particles , @xmath13 into total orbital angular momentum @xmath3 , and similarly for the total spin @xmath2 , and then construct @xmath14 indeed , such @xmath3-@xmath2 coupling could be found in the first approaches to the ipm for nuclei @xcite . with the understanding of a strong nuclear spin - orbit coupling , however ,",
    "it was seen as advantageous to adopt @xmath0-@xmath0 coupling @xcite , by first coupling up @xmath7 and @xmath8 for each particle as in ( [ ls1p ] ) and then summing the @xmath0s : @xmath15    nowadays the ipm has been superseded by the _ interacting _ or configuration - interaction ( ci ) shell model @xcite and other many - body methods .",
    "nonetheless one can consider how good the ipm is as a starting point by looking at semi - magic shells .",
    "for example , using the phenomenological interaction kb3 g ( which is a monopole - adjusted version@xcite of the kuo - brown interaction@xcite ) in the @xmath16-shell , one finds the full configuration - interaction wavefunction of @xmath17ca is @xmath18 a filled @xmath19 configuration ; and in the @xmath20-shell , using the phenomenological usdb ( universal @xmath20-shell interaction , version b ) interaction@xcite , the ground state of @xmath21o is @xmath22 filled @xmath23 configuration , and the ground state of @xmath24o is @xmath25 filled @xmath26 configuration .",
    "this simple success is not universal . in the @xmath20-shell , with the same usdb phenomenological interaction ,",
    "@xmath27si is only @xmath28 a filled @xmath29 configuration , and in the @xmath30-shell , using the cohen - kurath interaction @xcite , the ground state of @xmath31he is only @xmath32 a filled @xmath33 configuration while @xmath34c is about @xmath35 a filled @xmath36 configuration .",
    "in fact , it was known long ago , at least phenomenologically @xcite , that @xmath30-shell nuclei are intermediate between @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath3-@xmath2 coupling . in some @xmath30-shell cases",
    "the latter leads to a simpler description : the ground state of @xmath31he is @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath34c is @xmath39 @xmath38 ( see also section 5 of @xcite ) . for heavier nuclei , with stronger spin - orbit forces",
    ", @xmath3-@xmath2 coupling is less satisfactory : for the @xmath20-shell cases given above have grounds states which are roughly only @xmath40 components , and the @xmath17ca ground state has only about @xmath41 @xmath38 component .",
    "( how these decompositions are carried out will be described in more detail below . )",
    "this suggests @xmath3-@xmath2 decomposition as a tool to investigate theoretical wavefunctions , even if it is not directly experimentally measureable , especially for @xmath30-shell nuclei where phenomenological interactions suggest strong dominance by a few @xmath3-@xmath2 components .",
    "but what about more `` realistic '' interactions ?",
    "the past two decades have seen tremendous advances in _ ab initio _ calculations of nuclear structure , mostly for @xmath30-shell nuclides .",
    "as i will show below , both the phenomenological and _ ab initio _ wavefunctions , despite separated by six orders of magnitude in the basis dimensions , and over four decades in the origin of the interactions , show remarkable congruence in their @xmath3-@xmath2 decomposition . while @xmath3-@xmath2 composition is not directly measureable , it does have an effect on transitions such as gamow - teller , m1 , and so on ; furthermore this congruence suggests that both the old and the new calculations are probably doing something right .",
    "of course , any spin - orbit force will play a big role in the @xmath3-@xmath2 decomposition , and it is well - known that _",
    "ab initio _ three - body forces strongly influence spin - orbit interactions , for example to get the correct ground state spin for some @xmath30-shell nuclides @xcite . in this paper , intended as an introduction to and demonstration of the method",
    ", i only look at two - body interactions , but in the near future will examine how these results change with the addition of three - body forces .",
    "the tools used for this investigation come in three parts : the many - body method ; the interactions used ; and decomposition of the wavefunctions into @xmath3 and @xmath2 components .    the many - body method i use is configuration - interaction ( ci ) diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian in a shell - model basis @xcite , using the bigstick code @xcite . here",
    "one defines a finite single - particle space and has as input single - particle energies and two - body matrix elements ; three - body interactions can also be used , but will be investigated in future work .",
    "the calculations are carried out in occupation space , with occupation - representation of slater determinants built from single - particle states as the many - body basis states . in brief",
    ", one chooses a finite set of single particle orbits with good orbital angular momentum @xmath7 ( and thus good parity ) and good angular momentum @xmath0 and @xmath5-component @xmath42 ; with that it easy to build basis states with fixed total @xmath6 ; thus bigstick is termed an m - scheme code .",
    "bigstick computes the many - body hamiltonian in this basis from the input interaction matrix elements , i.e. , it computes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an occupation representation of a slater determinant with fixed @xmath6 , and finds the low - lying eigenpairs @xmath45 by the lanczos algorithm @xcite .    within this framework",
    "i use two different model spaces and interactions .",
    "first is the phenomenological cohen - kurath interaction @xcite , which works entirely within the @xmath46-@xmath47 space ; it has two single - particle energies and 15 unique two - body matrix elements .",
    "because the matrix elements were fitted to spectra , the radial component of the single - particle wavefunctions have not been rigorously defined ; fortunately for my purpose they are not needed . for a given number of valence protons and neutrons , and for fixed total @xmath6 , all possible configurations are used .",
    "the second are _ ab initio _ interactions in the so - called no - core shell model ( ncsm ) framework @xcite . here",
    "one uses harmonic oscillator single - particle states with a fixed frequency @xmath48 , and utilizes the @xmath49 truncation on the many - body states : one allows only many - body harmonic oscillator configurations which are a maximum of @xmath50 in energy above the lowest harmonic oscillator configuration .",
    "this allows one to exactly decouple the relative wavefunction from center - of - mass motion @xcite , although that is not important to this study",
    ".    high - precision _ ab initio _ interactions are fitted to low - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts and to deuteron properties . among the first",
    "was the argonne v18 @xcite , while more recent ones , such as the one used in this study @xcite , are derived from chiral effective field theory @xcite .",
    "these interactions generally have a large coupling between high- and low - momentum components , which is often interpreted as a ` hard core ; ' such a hard core can be seen directly in local interactions fitted to scattering data such as the argonne v18 and related potentials . while such interactions can be used directly in coupled - cluster ( cc ) calculations @xcite and , when local or nearly so , in green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) calculations @xcite , both of those very powerful methodologies favor the ground state .",
    "finding excited states are challenging , though not impossible , for cc and gfmc calculations , and the technology for projecting out the @xmath3 and @xmath2 components in those methods has not yet been developed .    for configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculations , on the other hand ,",
    "obtaining excited states and decomposition into @xmath3 and @xmath2 components is hardly more difficult than finding the ground state . on the other hand , unlike cc calculations , ci calculations include unlinked diagrams @xcite , and because of the strong coupling between low- and high - momentum states , the basis for ci grows exponentially and convergence with the size of the space is very slow in all but the smallest nuclides .",
    "therefore for _ ab initio _ ci calculations in computationally tractable spaces one usually softens or renormalizes the interaction via a unitary transformation .",
    "a very popular unitary transformation is the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) @xcite , whereby the hamiltonian is evolved by a flow equation : @xmath51,\\ ] ] where one commonly chooses the generator of the flow to be @xmath52,$ ] with @xmath53 the kinetic energy ; this drives the hamiltonian in momentum space towards the diagonal and weakens the coupling between low- and high - momentum states . because the transformation is unitary , any quantity represented by an eigenvalue , such as scattering phase shifts or the on - shell t - matrix elements if evolved in free space , remains unchanged .",
    "what do change are , for example , the off - shell t - matrix elements , but exploring that topic further is beyond the focus of this paper ; furthermore , 3-body forces are induced by the evolution @xcite .",
    "i follow the convention of parameterizing the evolution not by @xmath8 but by @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the nucleon mass ; then @xmath56 has units of @xmath57 .",
    "other authors follow @xmath8 , which is sometimes written as @xmath58 .",
    "it is worth describing in a little detail how the @xmath3-@xmath2 decomposition is carried out .",
    "suppose one wants to find the fraction of a ci wavefunction with a given @xmath3 , that is , to expand @xmath59 but in general , the dimension of the subspace of states with a given @xmath3 is greater than one .",
    "one naive method then is to generate all many - body states of a given @xmath3 or @xmath2 , that is , @xmath60 where @xmath61 carries any additional information needed to label such states .",
    "then the fraction of a state with that @xmath3 is @xmath62 this presupposes one can generate all the @xmath63 , for example by diagonalize the operator @xmath64 , but that is easy only in small spaces .",
    "instead i turn to a modification of the ` lanczos trick ' , invented for generating strength functions @xcite and which has been previously used to analyze phenomenological states in terms of their su(3 ) irreps @xcite .",
    "let @xmath65 be a ci wavefunction i wish to decompose in components labled by the eigenvalues of a hermitian operator , in this case @xmath64 .",
    "i carry out the lanczos algorithm with @xmath66 as my _ pivot _ , that is the starting vector @xmath67 : @xmath68 as is well - known for the lanczos algorithm @xcite , this procedure generates a krylov subspace and the eigenvalues of the tridiagonal matrix given by @xmath69 will converge to the extremal eigenpairs of @xmath64 , of which the eigenvectors are a linear combination of the lanczos vectors , @xmath70 which is an inversion of ( [ l_decomp ] ) .",
    "in fact the krylov space is exhausted by the eigenvectors of @xmath64 contained in the pivot , so that to get the fraction of @xmath71 with orbital angular momentum @xmath3 , it is just @xmath72 so that no sum is needed and one can simply read off the amplitude .    one can decompose using any hermitian operator , and the procedure for decomposition with spin @xmath2 is identical to the above .",
    "one can do joint decomposition , that is decompose a wavefunction into states of specific @xmath3 and @xmath2 , but i do not carry out such fine - grained analysis here .",
    "i give results for four nuclides from roughly the middle of the @xmath30-shell : @xmath73be , @xmath74b , and @xmath34c .",
    "in particular i look at states in @xmath34c known to be problematic , and at rotational bands in @xmath73be . for all ncsm calculations i used @xmath75 ( chosen",
    "so all the calculations could be easily carried out on a desktop computer using the bigstick code ) , an oscillator frequency @xmath76 mev for @xmath73be and 22 mev for the other nuclides for the single - particle basis , which roughly minimized the ground state energies , and an srg evolution parameter of @xmath77 @xmath57 .",
    "i also carried out an @xmath78 calculation for @xmath79b which required supercomputer time , for reasons discussed below in section [ b10 ] .",
    "because the phenomenological calculations with the cohen - kurath force only include `` normal '' parity states , i.e. , the same parity as the ground state , i only show those , although there is no barrier to dissecting unnatural parity states using the method described in section [ ls ]    in standard ncsm procedures one carefully finds the variational minimum as a function of @xmath80 and studies the convergence as a function of the model space parameter @xmath49 .",
    "instead , i demonstrate selected @xmath34c results are relatively robust under variation of both @xmath80 and @xmath56 . using a fifth light nuclide , @xmath81li",
    ", i demonstrate robustness as @xmath49 is varied from 6 to 12 .",

    "it will be interesting in the future to investigate other rotational bands in more detail , in particular @xmath81li / be .",
    "the results are fairly robust even when the basis is changed , and not very sensitive to the srg evolution  although there is some sensitive at the end of srg evolution",
    ". it will be very interesting therefore to use three - body forces , both `` true '' three - body forces and those induced by srg .",
    "the former are known to affect spin - orbit coupling , and it will be interesting to see if it brings the ncsm results closer to or further apart from the cohen - kurath ; the latter should decrease sensitivity to srg evolution . in principal of course , one should also evolve the @xmath64 and @xmath170 operators which should also decrease sensitivity to srg evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore an important future step will be to look at chiral interactions including _ ab initio _ three - body forces @xcite , and alternate _ ab initio _ approaches such as the jisp16 interaction@xcite which has off - shell matrix elements tuned to best match binding energies , and thus reduce the need for three - body forces .",
