    "predicting the equation of state is a simple approach to probe the validity of approximation methods in the theory of liquids .",
    "for hard - sphere ( hs ) fluids , several methods have been proposed to derive the equation of state , such as the energy , virial , or compressibility equation of state in terms of an approximate pair distribution function ; and the virial expansion of the equation of state  @xcite . among the many derivations ,",
    "the method proposed by shinomoto is unique .",
    "shinomoto derived the equation of state for hs fluids by calculating the density profile and pair distribution function  @xcite .",
    "the calculation is based on estimating the minimum work required to overcome the depletion force  @xcite between ( i ) an hs and a hard wall and ( ii ) between two hss .",
    "shinomoto s method is simpler and more concise than the numerous methods based on integral equations and is as accurate as the semiempirical carnahan - stirling equation of state  @xcite .",
    "using shinomoto s concept , the accuracy of the pair distribution function for an hs fluid turns out to be midway between that obtained by the born - green - yvon theory and by the percus - yevick theory  @xcite .",
    "shinomoto s method is not restricted to spherical molecules but is applicable to complex molecules as well . in this paper ,",
    "i apply shinomoto s concept to parallel hard - spherocylinder ( spc ) fluids . by calculating the pair distribution function of the spc fluid via shinomoto s method ,",
    "i obtain the fluid pressure by both shinomoto s original route and the virial route  @xcite .",
    "the results agree well with numerical simulation data via the former route when the length - to - width ratio is less than and equal to 0.25 , and via the latter route for spcs with length - to - width ratio greater than and equal to 2 up to @xmath1 .",
    "in this section , i extend shinomoto s method for a uniform monodisperse fluid consisting of parallel rigid spcs . although the discussion here is restricted to hard spc fluids , it is also applicable , with slight modifications , to general hard - body fluids .",
    "the length and width of the spcs are represented by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , and the number density of the bulk spc fluid is given by @xmath4 .",
    "the packing fraction is denoted by @xmath5 , with the volume of an spc being @xmath6 .",
    "the symmetry axes of all spcs in the fluid are aligned in a common direction .",

    "the minimum work @xmath11 is nonzero because spc@xmath12 is subjected to a nonvanishing effective force @xmath15 since the density @xmath16 is now inhomogeneous because of the existence of spc@xmath14 . for example , when spc@xmath14 and spc@xmath12 are close enough that their excluded volumes overlap , the pressure exerted on the surface of spc@xmath12 from surrounding spcs vanishes inside the excluded volume of spc@xmath14 because of the absence of any spc within this volume .",
    "however , outside this excluded volume , the pressure is nonzero .",
    "this mechanism to generate an effective force is similar to that required for the depletion force between particles suspended in the solutions of macromolecules  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the surface of the excluded volume of spc@xmath12 at @xmath13 , and let @xmath18 be a point on @xmath17 .",
