    "nuclear starburst - driven winds are now observed in dozens of external galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum ( strickland 2001 ; martin 1999 ; heckman 2002 ; veilleux 2002 ) . for nearby galaxies , detailed studies reveal that the superwind energetics are in the range 10@xmath11 to 10@xmath12 erg .",
    "galaxy - scale winds are suspected to be important in both galaxy evolution and for the state of the intergalactic medium . in the galaxy , early enrichment of the halo and the outer disk through powerful nuclear winds may account for the observed abundances of the thick disk and globular clusters ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , nuclear winds can regulate the growth of the central bulge ( carlberg 1999 ) and moderate the evolution of dwarf satellites ( irwin  1987 ) .    at a distance of only 8.0@xmath130.5 kpc ( reid 1993 )",
    ", the galactic center shows a remarkable range of energetic activity at infrared , radio , x - ray and @xmath14-ray wavelengths ( morris & serabyn 1996  hereafter ms ; yusef - zadeh  2000 ; cheng  1997 ) . while this activity has proved difficult to disentangle , there is now solid evidence on scales of arcminutes to tens of degrees for powerful mass ejections from the galactic center .",
    "potential sources of energy are young star clusters or the @xmath15 m@xmath16 central black hole ( oort 1977 ; frogel 1988 ; genzel1996 ; ghez  1998 ) .",
    "individual star clusters have ages ranging from 5  myr ( krabbe  1995 ) to 20  myr ( eckart  1999 ; figer  2000 ; gezari  2002 ) . while the star formation history is undoubtedly complicated , there is now abundant evidence that the galactic center has experienced starburst episodes at different times in the past ( e.g. tamblyn & rieke 1993 ; sjouwerman  1998 ; simpson  1999 ) .",
    "detailed modelling of the pah and fine structure features ( lutz 1998 ) suggests a starburst event some 7  myr ago , supported by a census of individual stars ( genzel  1994 ; krabbe  1995 ; najarro  1997 ) .",
    "an acute shortcoming of galaxy wind studies to date has been deriving reliable energetics from multi - wavelength observations .",
    "we will argue that the proximity of the galactic center makes this one of the most important arenas for studying the wind process .",
    "but current estimates of the central energetics span a huge range .",
    "sofue & handa ( 1984 ) presented evidence of a radio lobe on scales of @xmath17 pc ( now referred to as the galactic center lobe ) with implied thermal energetics of roughly @xmath18 erg .",
    "chevalier ( 1992 ) argued for a higher energy content ( @xmath19 erg ) arising from stellar winds driven by hot young stars over a 30 myr duration .",
    "several authors have deduced that an explosive nuclear event ( @xmath20 erg ) must have taken place from the high temperatures implied by the asca detection of 6.7  kev k@xmath21 line emission from he - like fe  xxv ( koyama  1996 ; yamauchi  1990 ) . on larger scales , sofue ( 1977 ; 1984 ; 1994 ; 2000 ) has long argued that the north polar spur is the byproduct of a central explosion which took place 15 myr ago . in his model ,",
    "the scale of the blast is 10@xmath2220 kpc , with explosive energies in the range 10@xmath23 to 3@xmath24 erg .",
    "the source of fuel for the observed activity appears to be the central molecular zone ( cmz ) , a molecular ` ring ' with radius 180  pc and total mass m@xmath25 m@xmath26 .",
    "recent estimates of mass inflow to the galactic center are of order 1 m@xmath16 per year ( ms ) .",
    "this is sufficient to trigger starbursts and nuclear activity associated with powerful seyfert galaxies ( @xmath110@xmath27 erg s@xmath28 ) .",
    "the kinematics suggest the gas is kept on @xmath29 orbits by a strong central bar , which guarantees cloud - cloud collisions on timescales of @xmath30 yrs .",
    "of particular interest here , a central explosion of order @xmath31 erg would provide a central gas mass m@xmath32 with sufficient radial impulse to produce the observed ring ( sanders 1989 ; saito 1990 ) .",
    "sophisticated hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. suchkov  1996 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) show that such rings are indeed formed by central explosions and that disk material is entrained by the expanding wind .",
    "so what are the true energetics of the galactic center wind , and is it a periodic or continuous flow ? is the wind driven by the central black hole or by bursts of star formation , or both ?",
    "here , we present the first clear evidence that the nuclear wind which gave rise to the galactic center lobe ( gcl ) is entraining large amounts of molecular gas and dust in the flow .",
    "the newly derived energetics , which are much larger than earlier estimates , are of the same order needed to explain the north polar spur ( nps ) in terms of a central explosion , which strongly suggests that the galactic center undergoes periodic bursts of nuclear activity , as we show .    in   2 , the new msx observations are presented and compared to existing far - infrared and radio data . in   3 , we find that the elevated dust temperature in the gcl requires a local heat source . in   4 , we derive the basic properties of the nuclear wind . in   5 ,",
    "we revisit sofue s earlier wind model for the nps in light of new observations . in   6 ,",
    "we argue that the galactic center arena is of extreme importance in our quest to understand large - scale winds .",
    "in fig .  [ rawdata ] , we present a 3  @xmath33 3  region of the galactic center reconstructed from scans with the msx satellite in ` band a ' at 8.28@xmath0 m .",
    "the galactic center is at the center of the field .",
    "the same data are presented in fig .",
    "[ unsharp ] after unsharp masking to accentuate the dust above the galactic plane ( see below ) .",
    "the msx image is made up of 6  pixels generated by convolving position - tagged , artefact - corrected level 2a data .",
    "the adopted kernel was gaussian with a 3  standard deviation using a cartesian projection and galactic coordinates for the world coordinate system .",
    "this results in a resolution of about 20 .",
    "full details of the galactic plane survey , data processing and the creation of the images are given by price  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the image is calibrated absolutely in radiance units of w m@xmath34 sr@xmath28 , and a mosaic of 3@xmath333 individual msx images was created to span a 3  @xmath33 3  area . in fig .",
    "[ rawdata ] , the central disk is characterized by point sources ( stars ) , small extended regions ( compact and ultracompact  regions ) , but the overwhelming impression is of a lattice of overlapping filaments and bubbles along the galactic plane .",
    "many of these features have counterparts in radio continuum ( cohen & green 2001 ; mezger & pauls 1979 ) .",
    "compared to the iras 12@xmath0 m data , the msx 8.3@xmath0 m map is four times more sensitive , with 35 times higher areal resolution .",
    "note from the star counts that there is moderate extinction in the plane even at 8@xmath0 m .",
    "our particular interest lies in the spectacular mid - infrared ` spurs ' which rise 1  above and below the plane at @xmath35 .",
    "there are similar features , rather less well defined , at @xmath36 .",
    "the prominent western spur first came to light in the original 20  cm scans of kerr & sinclair ( 1966 ) . in figs .",
    "[ radio ] and [ unsharp ] , we have superimposed the 3  cm map of sofue ( 1985 ) which has a beam size of 4.3  ( hpbw ) .",
    "there is a remarkably tight correlation of off - planar structure in both the radio and mid - infrared maps , in particular the eastern and western spurs at 3  cm coincide precisely with the same features at 8@xmath0 m .",
    "the spurs , which are also evident at 6  cm and 11  cm , appear to be largely thermal in origin , although there is some evidence for synchrotron emission from the eastern spur ( inoue  1984 ) .",
    "the western spur is prominent in the iras data base ( ms ) in the 12 , 25 , 60 , 100@xmath0 m bands . in a 2  beam ,",
    "gautier  ( 1984 ) obtained a dust temperature of @xmath37  k at @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "this temperature is broadly consistent with the dust temperature maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we now determine whether the dust temperature , or the observed constant emissivity of the spurs vertical to the plane , are consistent with heating by the stellar radiation field .",
    "the total flux at a frequency @xmath40 reaching a dust cloud located at a distance @xmath41 is obtained from integrating the specific intensity @xmath42 over an optically thin disk with uniform emissivity , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the directions of the line of sight and the outward normal to the surface of the disk , respectively . for the general case ,",
    "if we consider the flux seen at an arbitrary point along the polar axis of the disk , @xmath46 where the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy @xmath47 is integrated over frequency out to a radius @xmath48 . in the far field ( @xmath49 ) , this equation reduces to the familiar form @xmath50 . in the near field ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "the flux along the polar axis is constant . in principle , this could explain why the mid - infrared emissivity along the spurs is roughly constant .",
    "the equilibrium temperature a dust grain will assume at a distance @xmath41 from the source is given by @xmath52 where ( @xmath53 ) are the absorption and re - radiation efficiencies , and @xmath54 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "if we assume that @xmath55 , then for r @xmath56 12 kpc and @xmath57 l@xmath16 , we derive @xmath58  k at a vertical distance of 100  pc .",
    "for an exponential disk with scale length r@xmath59 @xmath56 3.5  kpc , the dust temperature rises to @xmath60  k. the infrared spurs appear to require a much larger heating rate than what the disk can provide .",
    "possible mechanisms are shock heating from the wind , or turbulent heating from the entrainment process .",
    "these processes are discussed below .      in figs .",
    "[ rawdata ]  [ unsharp ] , we show for the first time that dust is clearly associated with the _ entire _ gcl structure .",
    "this is a particularly important result since it shows that the galactic center wind is entraining dust in the flow .",
    "there is widespread evidence of entrainment in external galaxy winds .",
    "this includes reversals of the magnetic field in wind - blown shells , where the gas also shows evidence for rotation and expansion ( cecil  2001 ; 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , hot wind gas detected in [ o@xmath61 is found to be moving more rapidly than the cool gas ( heckman  2001 ) .",
    "the measured column density of dust in the shell implies a hydrogen column density of n@xmath62 h@xmath63 cm@xmath34 which compares with n@xmath65 h@xmath63 cm@xmath34 determined from co observations by sofue ( 1995 ) when averaged over both spurs .",
    "these high column densities could lead to even lower dust grain temperatures in the shell than derived in ",
    "3.1 due to preferential absorption of high energy radiation .",
    "this is not guaranteed since the gas and dust could have a complex ( fractal ) distribution .",
    "we expect that the shell comprises a complex matrix of molecular , neutral and ionized gas",
    ". there are numerous nebular sources within the ism for which the dust temperature measured independently from , say , the warm ionized medium and warm neutral medium are essentially identical ( lagache  2000 ; heiles  2000 ) , suggesting some form of local thermal equilibrium between the different phases .",
    "we now estimate the mass of entrained material in the wind .",
    "we model the gcl as a ` telescope dome'-shaped shell with thickness @xmath66 . if the cylindrical part has a height @xmath67 and radius @xmath41 , the total volume of the bipolar shell is @xmath68 .",
    "the volume enclosed by the dome in both hemispheres is @xmath69 . in order to reproduce the 8.3@xmath0 m observations ,",
    "our preferred model is ( @xmath66,r , h ) = ( 5,60,110 ) pc which gives @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath71 @xmath75 @xmath73 .",
    "the expected limb - brightening contrast is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the beam size of the iras measurement .",
    "thus , we find @xmath78 which explains why the central bipolar cavity looks remarkably free of filamentation compared to outside this region .    in our model , for the derived value of n@xmath79 (  3.1 ) , the volume - averaged shell density is @xmath80 h@xmath63 @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the total mass of the shells in both hemispheres is roughly m@xmath82  m@xmath16 . for a shell expansion velocity of @xmath83  ( sofue 1985 )",
    ", then the inferred _ minimum _ energetics in the bipolar wind is @xmath84 @xmath85 erg .",
    "new observations by sofue ( 1996 ) appear to indicate that the shell density could be a factor of a few lower ( @xmath86 @xmath81 ) , so a more conservative estimate of the required energetics is @xmath87 @xmath85 erg .",
    "the vertical velocity component of the shell structure is presently uncertain : we consider @xmath88  to be a plausible estimate .",
    "large radial and vertical motions are apparent in about a third of the cmz gas ( bally  1988 ) .",
    "the high - velocity component has a velocity range of 130200  but this is driven in part by the bar .",
    "we conclude that the minimum energy requirement for the dense shell is about 10@xmath89 erg for a covering fraction of unity (  assuming a closed shell surface ) .",
    "starburst and/or agn - driven winds are observed in several dozen external galaxies .",
    "detailed numerical simulations shed light on the basic mechanism ( strickland & stevens 2000 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; suchkov  1994 ) . in nuclear starbursts ,",
    "vast amounts of energy are injected by supernovae and stellar winds into a small central volume ( @xmath90 100 pc ) .",
    "the ` injection zone ' reaches temperatures of about 10@xmath91  k before the enormous pressure begins to drive a flow outwards .",
    "the nuclear wind is initially subsonic but becomes supersonic at the edge of the injection zone ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) .",
    "an adiabatic wind accelerates as it expands into the clumpy ism ( williams & dyson 2002 ) producing a conventional forward shock , contact discontinuity and reverse shock .",
    "the hot nuclear wind is surrounded by a weaker wind which percolates laterally through the clumpy medium .",
    "the hot wind drags material in a shear flow along the contact discontinuity ; the weaker wind entrains advected cool material along with the flow .",
    "the effectiveness of winds in entraining material is unclear , but models suggest moderate ( strickland & stevens 2000 ) to large ( suchkov  1996 ) amounts of mass loading can take place .",
    "it was initially thought that the bipolar x - ray emission seen in starburst galaxies could be explained by cooling in an adiabatic wind ( fabbiano 1988 ; bregman  1995 ) .",
    "mccarthy  ( 1987 ) attempted to confirm chevalier & clegg s wind model of m82 by assuming the optical filaments were in thermal equilibrium with the adiabatic wind .",
    "however , the ram pressure of the wind pressure greatly exceeds the thermal pressure once the wind breaks free of the injection zone .",
    "strickland  ( 1997 ) find that the observed x - ray emissivity in m82 declines too slowly to be explained by an adiabatic wind .",
    "both the optical and x - ray emission are more likely to arise from ram pressure confinement which produces a much flatter fall off with radius , and can even lead to increasing emissivity with radius ( veilleux  1994 ) .    due to the proximity of the galactic center , we make the simplifying assumption that all phases of the ism are uniformly filled at the resolution of the data ( cf .",
    "williams & dyson 2002 ) . the explicit dependence of derived quantities on filling factors can be found in cecil  ( 2001 ; 2002 ) .",
    "we now derive the properties of a galactic wind required to drive the shell material .",
    "asca has provided hard evidence for hot plasma towards the galactic center (  1 ) , and this is seen on similar scales to the gcl .",
    "the detection of very intense 6.7 kev k@xmath21 line from he - like fe ( koyama  1989 ; yamauchi  1990 ) leads to temperature estimates of 10@xmath92 to 10@xmath91k .",
    "the temperature range implies _ initial _ wind speeds ( @xmath93 ) in the range @xmath94  as expected from the numerical models .",
    "the fe k@xmath21 from the galactic center correlates well with the dense gas , which is expected since the hot x - rays are easily reflected by the cold neutral medium .",
    "once the x - ray spectra are corrected for the scattered component , the implied temperatures appear to be at the lower end of this range .",
    "the diameter of the injection zone is expected to be of order 100  pc in size .",
    "the dusty shell requires an energy input of at least 10@xmath89 erg .",
    "the clumpy appearance of the thermal radio emission and dust emission suggest that the covering fraction may be @xmath95 , such that the required energetics are @xmath96 erg .",
    "this is in line with sofue s ( 2000 ) minimum requirement to explain the north polar spur .",
    "the density of the hot medium over the dome volume is @xmath97 which is of order @xmath98 @xmath81 giving a mass of roughly 10@xmath99  m@xmath16 in the wind , where we have adopted the high temperature limit in line with simulations . for the inferred optical depth to the galactic center ( a@xmath100 @xmath71 30 ; becklin  1978 ) , x - ray absorption will only be significant for lower temperature gas .",
    "the expected x - ray emission measure is @xmath101 @xmath102 pc .    in order to arrive at a very rough dynamical timescale ,",
    "let us treat the gcl as a pressurized bubble with radial dimension @xmath41 , initially located at a radius @xmath103 within the stellar bulge , which is lifted by buoyancy .",
    "( this requires that the wind is only now breaking out of the injection zone for the first time . )",
    "assume that the medium outside of the shell has to fall around the lobe at a speed @xmath104 and that the lobe must move @xmath105 .",
    "the buoyancy timescale is therefore @xmath106 yr .",
    "our picture is of a light bubble that is temporarily overpressured relative to its surroundings and thus rises and expands as the ambient density falls .",
    "the enclosed mass in the galactic center is @xmath107  @xmath103  m@xmath16 , where @xmath103 is specified in parsecs ( ms ) , which leads to @xmath108  myr .",
    "mccray ( 1987 ) gives an approximate form for the cooling function @xmath109 , from which we derive the cooling time in the hot wind , @xmath110 yr .",
    "this greatly exceeds the buoyancy timescale : the nuclear wind can not cool radiatively and must therefore expand adiabatically .    for the derived wind model , the required pressure @xmath111 k",
    "@xmath81 is an order of magnitude higher than what is possible with stellar winds from the central regions ( chevalier 1992 ) . remarkably , the derived properties ( @xmath112 ) are characteristic of _ individual _ supernova remnants ( holt & mccray 1982 )",
    ". since the volume of the gcl ( @xmath113 pc@xmath114 ) is at least three orders of magnitude larger than a typical supernova remnant , this testifies to a very large energy injection into a smaller central volume at some time in the past .",
    "we observe soft x - ray emission along the polar axis of the galaxy out to at least 2  kpc .",
    "the rosat 1.5  kev image presented by wang ( 2002 ) clearly shows the hourglass geometry characteristic of a bipolar flow ( see fig .",
    "[ 4panel](d ) ) .",
    "this emission is very unlikely to arise from thermal cooling in the wind .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the fast wind ( koo & mckee 1992 ) is driving shocks into the halo gas via ram pressure .",
    "the energy of the rosat band would implicate temperatures of @xmath115  k , or shock velocities @xmath116 .",
    "but the initial shock velocity at the base of the flow may be somewhat lower at @xmath117 .",
    "when a shock is driven into dense gas , the reflected shock re - heats the post - shocked gas to even higher temperatures . this phenomenon has now been resolved in the cygnus loop by the chandra x - ray satellite ( levenson  2002 ; hester  1994 ) .",
    "if we assume that all of the thermal energy in the injection zone is converted to kinetic energy , the initial wind speed is in excess of @xmath118 .",
    "the manner in which the wind parameters vary with radius depends in part on the wind geometry ( strickland  1997 ) . for an adiabatic wind , the mass density and temperature decline as @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "thus , at the 2 kpc radius of the rosat emission , the wind temperature has dropped to 10@xmath122  k and the density to @xmath123 @xmath81 where we have adopted @xmath124  pc .",
    "therefore , at 2  kpc , if the visible shocked material is ram - pressure confined , the pre - shock density is roughly @xmath125 @xmath81 .",
    "the post - shock material will be heated to a temperature of @xmath126k for singly shocked material ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) , or even higher temperatures for material heated by a reflected shock ( hester  1994 ) .",
    "the post - shock temperature @xmath127 is within the range favoured by numerical models ( e.g. suchkov  1994 ) , providing the gas has roughly solar abundances .",
    "we have assumed a fixed wind speed although in practice the wind could accelerate along the flow , depending on the wind geometry . in either case , the post - shock densities will be of order @xmath128 @xmath81 , much less than that inferred from the dusty shell .",
    "this is in line with the density of material responsible for the x - ray emission in the hydrodynamical models ( suchkov  1994 ; strickland  1997 ) .",
    "the post - shock zone ( @xmath129 ) has two important consequences .",
    "first , it is the expected source of the soft x - ray emission observed along the minor axis (  5 ) .",
    "the limb - brightened emission measures will be 10@xmath34 or higher , in agreement with sofue s hypershell model .",
    "this assumes that the attenuation by the galactic ism is low above @xmath130 , which appears to be so ( sofue 2000 ) .",
    "secondly , for a sufficiently soft radiation field ( @xmath131  kev ) , we show below that the expected uv / x - ray emission is partly soaked up by the dense shell downstream of the shock .",
    "this creates an ionized interface between the hot wind and the cool gas in the shell .",
    "a partially ionized region must exist in order to produce the thermal radio emission although the required electron densities are about @xmath132 @xmath81 ( sofue & handa 1984 ; sofue 1985 ) .",
    "once the radio background is subtracted , the lobe has a flat ( ` thermal ' ) spectral index , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the radio source flux . this behaviour is not normally associated with a shell - type supernova remnant , and may reflect self - ionization by the shock - induced uv field ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) , providing fermi acceleration is unimportant and the wind is non - relativistic .",
    "the derived mass of the thermal plasma is m@xmath135 m@xmath16 .",
    "a rough estimate of the ionization fraction is therefore m@xmath136m@xmath79 @xmath1 10% .",
    "the uv / x - ray emissivity of the post - shock region may account for much of the local ionization and heating , particularly if the shock velocity does not exceed 600  or thereabouts .",
    "the expected emissivity per unit solid angle is @xmath137 erg cm@xmath34 s@xmath28 sr@xmath28 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the mass of the h atom .",
    "if the shell is completely filled , most of the photons will interact with the bipolar shell ; half of the photons will contribute to line radiation , and the remainder will produce energetic secondary electrons . if @xmath130  ev is given up in each ionization by secondary electrons , we derive an h@xmath21 emission measure of @xmath1100 @xmath102 pc , and a local electron density of about @xmath140 @xmath81 .",
    "this suggests the bipolar shell is partially ionized with @xmath141 in agreement with the rough value derived above",
    ". this agreement may be fortuitous : the covering fraction _ seen by the local radiation field _ may be 10% or less which will lower the derived h@xmath21 emission measure and ionization fraction .",
    "the derived x - ray flux is too low to irradiate the dust grains to the observed temperature (  3.1 ; voit 1991 ) .",
    "an alternative heat source are the ly@xmath21 photons produced in the post - shock region which are continuously absorbed and re - emitted by neutral atoms until they are ultimately absorbed by dust .",
    "if the ly@xmath21 heating is balanced by the far - infrared emission , an equilibrium grain temperature can be derived . following spitzer ( 1978 ) ,",
    "the derived grain temperatures fall in the range 2050  k depending on the details of the grain composition ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "the contribution to the grain heating by electron collisions within the shell gas is expected to be small .",
    "collisional heating requires low gas densities ( @xmath142 @xmath81 ) and much higher kinetic temperatures ( @xmath143k ) , but such harsh environs can easily destroy grains ( dwek & arendt 1992 ) . we refrain from presenting a more detailed analysis since the post - shock environs are expected to be very complicated for dust grains ( mckee  1987 ) .",
    "the north polar spur extends 80  in galactic latitude perpendicular to the plane , and is the largest projected structure seen at x - ray and radio wavelengths ( berkhuijsen 1972 ; haslam  1974 ; snowden  1997 ; sofue 2000 ) . in a long running series of papers , sofue ( 1977 ; 1984 ; 1994 ; 2000 )",
    "has suggested that the nps can be explained in terms of an extremely powerful central explosion in the last 15  myr with a blast radius reaching to 10 kpc or more .",
    "more local origins have been proposed (  egger & aschenbach 1995 ) .",
    "however , we agree with sofue that a galactic center origin is more likely for a number of reasons : ( i ) the radio continuum in the nps is thermal rather than the synchrotron emission observed locally in supernova remnants ; ( ii ) the loop appears well aligned with the galactic center ; ( iii ) there is now well established evidence on scales of arcminutes to tens of degrees for powerful mass ejections from the galactic center ; ( iv ) the required energetics may be rather lower ( @xmath144 erg ) than the model favoured by sofue ",
    "such energies are relatively common in well studied , nearby galaxies ( veilleux 2002 ) .    in light of the new results presented here",
    ", we now revisit sofue s ( 2000 ) hypershell model for the north polar spur .",
    "we return to the discussion of the wind parameters derived in  4.3 . at 10 kpc ,",
    "the wind density has declined to about 10@xmath145 @xmath81 and the wind temperature to about 10@xmath99  k. the expected emission measures in the post - shocked gas are now a hundred times lower than what we inferred at a radius of 2  kpc which falls below the sensitivity limit of x - ray satellites and so would not be seen .",
    "how are we to understand this ?",
    "a possible explanation is that the post - shock densities are in fact higher than we derive , due to material dragged along or accelerated by the wind , and being shocked by the wind .",
    "this is a highly complex process that has not been adequately modelled to date .",
    "another interpretation , which we now discuss in detail , considers how the hypershell model would appear _ in the near field_. this step improves on sofue s model in two ways .",
    "the nps is seen to extend to galactic latitudes of 80 , and therefore any large - scale model _ must _ consider the angular projection . first , our model provides a simple explanation of why the nps appears closed at the top , an effect that is not apparent in sofue s model .",
    "second , the near field projection provides a very long pathlength through the hypershell on the near side , such that even a very low emission measure can be boosted by factors of a hundred or more . as a result",
    ", the required nuclear energetics of the wind can be much lower ( see below ) .",
    "we point out that sofue ( 2000 ) did carry out a near - field projection of a conical wind flow but the @xmath146-shaped geometry arises from a truncation along the vertical axis at a constant wind density .",
    "sofue s particular cone model does not lead to limb brightening at the apex of the nps , and in fact leads to caustics at @xmath147  which are inconsistent with the x - ray / radio observations .",
    "consider the hypershell geometry in fig .",
    "[ model](a ) .",
    "narrow cone angle or cylindrical outflows are evident in several starburst galaxies ( bland & tully 1988 ; gtz  1990 ; mckeith  1995 ; shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) and arise in hydrodynamical models ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical models reproduce this combination of an open central cone developing into a more restricted opening angle further out .",
    "the projected morphology in the model over the inner 30  is _ precisely _ what is observed in the 1.5 kev rosat survey data ( see fig .",
    "[ 4panel](d ) taken from wang 2002 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission extends 16  in elevation above and below the galactic center .",
    "the model presents the hypershells in both hemispheres .",
    "sofue ( 2000 ) finds only weak evidence for the southern hypershell on the largest scales , but we note here that the 1.5 kev rosat survey clearly reveals the southern biconal outflow .",
    "now consider how the hypershell geometry would appear _ in the near field_. recall that the nps extends to 80  in galactic latitude .",
    "our viewpoint in the galactic plane is indicated by the symbol @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ model](a ) .",
    "the near - field projection is shown in fig .",
    "[ model](b ) .",
    "the open hypershell now _ appears _ to close since our line of sight at high latitude intersects a large column through the biconal shell .",
    "the observed ` mirage ' is quite robust to a range of parameters , although it does require that the central cone turns inwards inside of the solar circle , and that the geometry becomes cylindrical or even tapers (  the wine glass effect ) .",
    "there are two important reasons why the hypershell geometry must be confined to the solar cylinder (  the cylinder which extends perpendicular to the galactic plane and intersects it at the solar circle ) .",
    "first , if the conic geometry continues to extend beyond the solar circle rather than turn inwards , the projected emission produces caustics near @xmath149 .",
    "secondly , if the nps is at the distance of the galactic center , the projected angular width of the hypershell on the sky is fully consistent with the turn up of the cone in the orthogonal plane defined by @xmath150  ( compare figs .",
    "[ model](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this of course assumes that the hypershell has cylindrical symmetry about its long axis .",
    "given that the 1.5 kev data reveal a biconal geometry extending above and below the plane by 2  kpc or more , it is difficult to imagine another configuration that makes more sense given that it _ must _ include the angular projection .",
    "our model is only illustrative .",
    "we do not optimize the parameters since physical insight requires a detailed hydrodynamical simulation matched to the observed galaxy parameters .",
    "[ model](c ) and [ model](d ) show the contributions of the x - ray emission from the near and far side of the galactic center .",
    "a key prediction of our model is that much of the emission at low latitude ( @xmath151 ) within the nps must arise from the far side of the hypershell .",
    "the compression induced by the projection will partly compensate for the inverse square dilution and absorption by the ism . the illustrative model shown here",
    "does not include attenuation by the ism ( see sofue 2000 ) .",
    "the limb effect arises from the nearside , and the filling in arises largely from the farside of the hypershell .",
    "if we add attenuation by intervening gas , it is possible to suppress the degree to which projected shell appears filled in .",
    "we now return to the original question in   5.1 .",
    "the near - field effect assists the interpretation of the x - rays in two ways .",
    "the source of the emission is now @xmath132 kpc rather than @xmath152 kpc in sofue s model ; this increases the wind pressure by a factor of @xmath153 . the increased post - shock density and the longer column through the hypershell raises the emission measure by a factor of 100 to roughly 10@xmath34  @xmath102  pc or higher .",
    "this is sofue s requirement in order to match the nps at 0.75  kev . in our model , a central explosion of @xmath154 erg , which was needed to explain the gcl , is probably sufficient to account for the nps , rather than the upper limit of @xmath155 erg preferred by sofue ( 2000 ) .",
    "we note with interest that the projected emission measure of the bipolar shell at large radius would not be directly detectable in x - rays in external galaxies .",
    "it is plausible that most disk galaxies with active star formation have low surface - brightness bipolar winds",
    ". a physical manifestation of this may be the extraordinary ionization conditions that have been observed in the gaseous haloes of edge - on spiral galaxies (  collins & rand 2001 ) .",
    "our proposed model invites a range of tests . in our model ,",
    "the nps is very sharp edged which is expected regardless of how the hypershell emission decays with vertical height above the plane .",
    "the angular limb brightening caused by the near - field effect is more rapid than limb brightening in a distance source .",
    "thus , there should be little hot gas outside of the loop which defines the nps .",
    "moreover , there should be a lot of x - ray emission at galactic latitudes below @xmath156  from the far side of the hypershell .",
    "furthermore , in line with the hydrodynamical simulations , the gas on the inner edge of the nps will be characteristically hotter and more redshifted (  moving at higher velocities ) than the gas towards the outer edge of the nps .",
    "sembach  ( 1997 ) have shown the enormous potential of absorption - line uv spectroscopy towards halo stars and active galaxies used as background light sources .",
    "the initial work with fuse and the hubble space telescope reveals complex ionization and kinematics towards 3c  273 whose sightline falls close to the nps .",
    "halo clump giants and blue horizontal branch stars are crucial for testing the wind model .",
    "their projected density at @xmath157 is about 1 per square degree and they can be seen to 20  kpc .",
    "an exciting prospect is the nasa small explorer mission spidr due to launch in 2005 .",
    "this will map the distribution of civ and ovi ionization over a quarter of the sky ( including nps ) at arcmin resolution .",
    "future observations with spidr may reveal complex ionization and kinematics along and across the nps due to the turbulent boundary layer expected at the wind - halo gas interface .",
    "the halo probes will need to have distances of 10  kpc or more in order to see this effect .    in summary",
    ", we propose that the north polar spur arises from limb brightening as we look along the outer walls of the bipolar shell from a near - field perspective . furthermore",
    ", the faint hypershell would be very difficult to detect in external galaxies : _ energetic bipolar winds may be far more common in normal galaxies than is currently observed_.",
    "* recurrent nuclear activity . *",
    "we have presented evidence for mass ejections from the galactic center on scales of a few degrees to tens of degrees .",
    "this is evident from extended bipolar emission at mid - infrared , radio and x - ray wavelengths ; the three very different scales are shown together in fig .",
    "[ 3panel ] .",
    "the inner shell visible in the 8.3@xmath0 m data , and physically associated with the galactic center lobe , has a dynamical timescale of about a million years .",
    "this compares with roughly 15  myr for the hypershell model of the north polar spur . on all scales ,",
    "the observed structures show a remarkable similarity to the observed behavior in ngc 3079 ( cecil  2001 ; 2002 ) where an inner radio - emitting shell is observed at the centre of a much large conic shell .",
    "we note that ngc 3079 and the galaxy share important similarities in their wind parameters and their galaxy properties .",
    "moreover , note that the bipolar geometry and the central star forming region in fig .",
    "[ unsharp ] appear tipped over by about 20   towards the west with respect to the galactic plane , a phenomenon that is seen in m82 ( shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) .",
    "this may arise from a tilt of the orbital plane of the central gas and/or stellar bar with respect to the galactic plane , for which there is some evidence ( ms ) .",
    "the different dynamical timescales of the gcl and nps indicate that these arise from different events .",
    "however , we find in   5.2 that both phenomena require a central event with roughly equivalent energetics of about 10@xmath23 erg , and this activity must be periodic on timescales of 10@xmath2215  myr .",
    "the stellar census provides clear evidence of several starbursts which must have occurred in this time frame , and these are the likely source of the energy input .",
    "it is not guaranteed that each starburst must produce an energetic wind .",
    "if the supernovae largely occur within dense gas , their thermalization effiencies can be @xmath158 such that the explosive energy is radiated away ( thornton  1998 ) .",
    "the timescale of the gcl could be consistent with evidence pointing to a major starburst in the last 7  myr . for an energy injection zone of 100 pc or so",
    ", the wind may not develop for a few million years after the event . this has been investigated by sophisticated numerical simulations ( suchkov  1994 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ; strickland  2002 ) .    * the resolution problem . * we stress that studies of the large - scale wind in the galaxy are of fundamental importance in understanding this complex process . to understand why",
    ", we return to the powerful nuclear wind ( or superbubble ) in ngc 3079 .",
    "high resolution x - ray and optical images ( strickland 2001 ; cecil  2002 ) show that most of the mass of the wind resides within the extended filaments , and that the wind material is clumpy down to the smallest scales observed",
    ". the smallest cloud scales in simulations must be very well sampled to treat entrainment and acceleration properly ( klein , mckee & colella 1994 ) , but the necessary resolution is one or two orders of magnitude smaller than what can be presently achieved ( strickland 2001 ) . in ngc 3079 , we may be seriously underestimating the mass loss and associated energetics in the nuclear wind",
    ".    the galactic center does not suffer resolution problems to anything like the same degree , and is therefore an extremely important source of information on the ubiquitous phenomenon of nuclear winds .",
    "although the extinction to the galactic center from x - ray to mid - infrared wavelengths is high , moderate levels of extinction are also inferred towards the nuclear winds in external galaxies because these need to be highly inclined in order to see the extended wind emission .",
    "the proximity of the galactic center suggests a number of important experiments . the observed @xmath159al line emission in @xmath14-rays ( mahoney  1984 ; genzel & townes 1987 ) indicates that supernova activity appears to be ongoing .",
    "sub - millimeter observations will determine whether these supernovae reside within dense or tenuous gas .",
    "we have identified starburst activity as the likely source of the wind , but it is well known that agns produce powerful winds (  schiano 1986 ) . a key experiment is to trace the @xmath159al @xmath14-ray line emission or the pressure profile in thermal radio emission to establish if the injection zone is resolved or continues to rise towards the central black hole .",
    "radio continuum measurements are also needed in order to measure the transverse magnetic field associated with the wind .",
    "magnetohydrodynamical processes can radically alter the development of the wind .",
    "the post - shock regions are likely to be complicated .",
    "the fuse , chandra and xmm satellites are essential for measuring gas temperatures where the wind interacts with the halo or entrained ism , either through direct emission or from absorption lines towards background sources . in the coming years",
    ", we anticipate a far deeper understanding of galactic winds arising from detailed multiwavelength studies of the galactic center .",
