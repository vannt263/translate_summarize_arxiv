    "the production of quark - antiquark bound states in nuclear collisions has long been studied for evidence of a phase transition between normal nuclear matter , where quarks and gluons are confined in hadrons , to a plasma phase where colored partons are deconfined .",
    "early predictions of charmonium suppression as an unambiguous signature of deconfinement  @xcite have proven to be overly simplistic , as a variety of competing mechanisms have been identified which do not require color screening to disrupt bound state @xmath8 pair formation and hadronization .",
    "it is necessary to quantitatively account for these effects to correct interpretation of what the measurements of quarkonia suppression in nuclear collisions imply about the quantum - chromodynamics phase diagram .    the heavy charm and bottom quarks are of particular interest , as they are produced through hard processes that are calculable with perturbative quantum - chromodynamics techniques  @xcite and their bound states are accessible experimentally through decays to dileptons",
    ". models of @xmath9 and @xmath10 bound state production generally factorize quarkonia production into two stages : first , the prompt initial heavy quark production via gluon fusion , and after a formation time @xmath11 , the mechanism leading to hadronization into the final color singlet state  @xcite . in collisions involving nuclei ,",
    "the initial heavy quark production can be affected by modifications of the parton distribution functions  @xcite , energy loss in the nucleus  @xcite , and scattering with other partons  @xcite .",
    "effects which may be of hydrodynamic origin are also present in small systems  @xcite , and may further alter the heavy quark final state  @xcite .",
    "if these flow effects are due to quark - gluon - plasma formation , the presence of deconfined colored partons can inhibit coalescence into a bound state or dissolve fully - formed bound states  @xcite .",
    "the fully - formed pair may also be broken up through interactions with comoving hadrons outside the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "one way to isolate final - state effects is through studies of states with the same quark content but different binding energies , such as the charmonium states @xmath1 and @xmath0 , with binding energies of @xmath7640 and @xmath750 mev , respectively  @xcite . before the charmonium formation time",
    "@xmath120.15 fm/@xmath13 , the precursor state is thought to be the same and so any effects on the precursor are likely identical . while significant initial - state effects on open charm have been found at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite , these should equally affect all charm pairs before projection onto a final state .",
    "therefore any differences in the modification of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production are likely due to late time effects which are sensitive to differences in the fully - formed meson radius and binding energy .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath0 suppression in @xmath2@xmath14 collisions by the e866/nusea  @xcite and na50  @xcite experiments were found to be well explained by models based on the breakup of fully formed charmonium states inside the nucleus , which naturally leads to a larger effect on the @xmath0 due to its larger radius  @xcite .",
    "however , this model fails to reproduce data from @xmath15au collisions at midrapidity at rhic  @xcite , where the higher beam energy and shorter nuclear crossing time means the @xmath9 pairs project onto their final states outside the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "breakup mechanisms which occur after the formation time can however explain the different suppression .",
    "measurements over different rapidity intervals in asymmetric collisions can simultaneously provide information on the evolution of the @xmath9 state in different hadronic environments . in the @xmath16he - going direction , there are relatively few produced particles , while in the @xmath17-going direction , there may be significant final state interactions between the quarkonia state and the higher number of comoving hadrons .",
    "here , we present measurements in 2015 of the relative yields of @xmath0 to @xmath1 mesons at forward and backward rapidity in , , , and collisions at = 200 gev .",
    "we find that the relative production rate of @xmath0 to @xmath1 mesons in collisions is consistent with expectations from a modified color evaporation model of charmonium production  @xcite . in @xmath18he@xmath3@xmath17 collisions , over the forward ( @xmath18he - going ) rapidity interval",
    "@xmath19 the relative production rates of the two states are consistent with what is found in .",
    "however , over the backward ( @xmath17-going ) rapidity interval @xmath20 , the @xmath0 is preferentially more suppressed than the @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath72 , which is likely due to final state effects such as interactions with comoving hadrons .",
    "dimuons from @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays were measured with the phenix muon spectrometer , which comprises two arms covering the forward and backward rapidity intervals @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "muons considered in this analysis pass through a the forward vertex tracking detector ( fvtx )  @xcite , a hadron absorber with a thickness of @xmath21 interaction lengths , then through three multi - plane cathode strip tracking chambers which reside in a radial magnetic field .",
    "after the tracking chambers are more layers of absorbers and iarocci tubes for muon identification , where tracks must penetrate at least 2.5 interaction lengths of additional steel absorber . the dimuon trigger used in this analysis records events which have two tracks in the same spectrometer arm that pass through all absorber material .",
    "previous phenix measurements were not able to resolve the smaller @xmath0 peak in the dimuon mass spectrum near the larger , broad @xmath1 peak ( cf .",
    "however , the introduction of the four silicon tracking layers of the fvtx in 2012 now allows a precise measurement of the pair opening angle to be made before the muons undergo multiple scattering in the absorber .",
    "the additional fvtx tracking improves the dimuon mass resolution and reduces combinatorial background from hadron decays , allowing separation of the two peaks .",
    "the measured dimuon mass spectra from , , , and collisions at = 200 gev are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fits ] , with the a  d ( e  h ) plots showing data recorded in the south ( north ) phenix muon spectrometer arm .",
    "these distributions comprise peaks at the @xmath1 and @xmath0 masses ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 gev/@xmath24 , respectively ) on top of correlated background from charm and bottom hadron decays and drell - yan pairs , plus combinatorial background from light meson decays and hadrons which are not stopped in the absorbers .",
    "the fits to the data are shown as a solid [ black ] line with a shaded [ gray ] band representing the 90% confidence level of the fit , with the resonances and total background components of the fit represented by dashed [ blue ] and dotted [ red ] lines , respectively .",
    "the combinatorial background contribution is extracted using event mixing techniques and is normalized to match the like - sign background . to determine systematic uncertainties on the relative yields that vary from 1% in @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2 collisions to 4% in collisions , the mass range over which the normalization is done",
    "is varied from a nominal range of 25 gev/@xmath25 to 1.55 gev/@xmath25 and 2.55.5 gev/@xmath25 .",
    "the correlated background is modeled in the fit by an exponential .",

    "the nuclear overlap @xmath29 is defined as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the spatial coordinates of the participating nucleons .",
    "this quantity is found via monte carlo glauber simulations of the various collision species  @xcite , with the @xmath4he geometry modified as described in ref .",
    "table  [ tab : n_table ] summarizes the results of these simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : double_rat_nch ] shows that the double ratio decreases as the comoving particle density increases , which is qualitatively consistent with expectations of charmonium breakup through final state interactions .",
    "the forward - rapidity phenix data at relatively low comover density shows no preferential suppression of @xmath33 , but the forward rapidity lhc data show a relative suppression that is comparable to the backward rapidity phenix data at similar comover density , within uncertainties .",
    "the backward lhc data , at the highest comover density , also shows relative suppression .",
    "understanding suppression due to comovers could play a critical role in interpreting quarkonia data from @xmath17@xmath3@xmath17 collisions .",
    "existing data on excited charmonia states in @xmath17@xmath3@xmath17 collisions generally suffer from poor statistics , large combinatorial backgrounds , and cover limited @xmath34 ranges  @xcite .",
    "however , a clear sequential suppression of the excited bottomonium states has been observed in pb@xmath3pb collisions at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "while color screening is expected to play a role , given the high charged particle density in these collisions , it is reasonable to expect that similar breakup mechanisms can also have an effect on these states . in particular , the highly suppressed @xmath35 state has a binding energy of only @xmath7200 mev , and may be especially sensitive to breakup through interactions with comoving particles .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that the relative production of @xmath0 to @xmath1 mesons in collisions at = 200 gev is consistent with expectations from a modified color evaporation model of charmonium production . in @xmath18he@xmath14 collisions at forward rapidity",
    "we observe no difference in the @xmath33 ratio relative to @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2 collisions , which indicates that any possible nuclear effects that are present in this rapidity region are common between the two states , and therefore appear to occur on a timescale that is short compared to the charmonium formation time . at backward rapidity , where the comoving particle density is higher , we find that the @xmath0 is preferentially suppressed by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "this effect is likely not due to any interaction in the nucleus , because the @xmath9 pair exits the nucleus before final meson formation occurs .",
    "the preferential suppression appears consistent with interactions of the fully formed color - neutral meson with comoving particles .",
    "the magnitude of this breakup mechanism is dependent on the meson binding energy , and is likely important for interpretation of sequential screening of quarkonia in @xmath17@xmath3@xmath17 collisions .",
