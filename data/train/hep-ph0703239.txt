    "to test the predictions of the standard model for the simultaneous violation of the charge conjugation and parity ( cp ) symmetries in @xmath4-meson decays , it is very important to know the matrix element @xmath0 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix @xcite very accurately .",
    "the uncertainties in existing measurements , by the cleo @xcite , babar @xcite , and belle @xcite collaborations , are dominantly due to uncertainties in the theoretical calculation of partial decay rates to be compared with the experimental measurements .",
    "experimentally , the inclusive rate @xmath5 of @xmath1 decays in a restricted region @xmath6 of phase space is measured , where the dominant charm background is suppressed and theoretical uncertainties are reduced .",
    "the theoretical factor @xmath7 directly relates the inclusive rate to @xmath0 without extrapolation to the full phase space , as @xmath8 the uncertainties in the calculation of @xmath7 dominantly originate from the modeling of the fermi motion of the @xmath3 quark inside the @xmath4 meson .",
    "most of the recent analyses towards the determination of @xmath0 from measurements of @xmath5 @xcite rely on the calculation of @xmath7 by lange _",

    "_ but there are many more approaches known for describing the non - perturbative @xmath9 transition .",
    "we mention the altarelli - cabibbo - corbo - maiani - martinelli ( accmm ) model @xcite , one of the oldest models to describe the motion of the @xmath3 quark inside the @xmath4 meson . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that the @xmath4 meson consists of the @xmath3 quark and a spectator quark , with definite mass @xmath10 and momentum @xmath11 , which is considered quasi - free .",
    "the @xmath3 quark is treated as a virtual particle with a mass depending on @xmath11 . another popular model for describing the non - perturbative @xmath9 transition",
    "is the model of bareiss , jin , palmer , and paschos based on the parton model approach in the light - cone ( lc ) limit @xcite .",
    "all these models , including the sf models , contain phenomenological functions of the respective variables describing the motion of the @xmath3 quark inside the @xmath4 meson with parameters fitted to the @xmath3-quark mass and one or two characteristic moments of these functions .",
    "another approach tries to avoid these non - perturbative functions by assuming that the fragmentation of the @xmath4 meson into the @xmath3 quark and the spectator quark can be described as a radiation process off the @xmath3 quark with a proper coupling inserted in the standard soft - gluon resummation formula @xcite . for a similar approach ,",
    "referred to as dressed - gluon exponentiation ( dge ) in the literature , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given the variety of approaches for treating the non - perturbative transition , it is desirable to make an attempt to compare these approaches with respect to their predictions for @xmath7 and other physical observables . in this work , we shall make such a comparison between the simple sf approach and the parton model approach in the lc limit , which we shall refer to as the lc approach in the following .",

    "one popular method to incorporate fermi - motion effects is the introduction of a sf @xmath53 , which is supposed to describe light - cone momentum distribution of the @xmath3 quark inside the @xmath4 meson @xcite .",
