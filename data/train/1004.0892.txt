    "security is an important issue in wireless systems due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions . in a pioneering work ,",
    "wyner in @xcite addressed the security problem from an information - theoretic point of view and considered a wire - tap channel model .",
    "he proved that secure transmission of confidential messages to a destination in the presence of a degraded wire - tapper can be achieved , and he established the secrecy capacity which is defined as the highest rate of reliable communication from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver while keeping the wire - tapper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages .",
    "recently , there has been numerous studies addressing information theoretic security .",
    "for instance , the impact of fading has been investigated in @xcite , where it has been shown that a non - zero secrecy capacity can be achieved even when the eavesdropper channel is better than the main channel on average .",
    "the secrecy capacity region of the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages and associated optimal power control policies have been identified in @xcite , where it is shown that the transmitter allocates more power as the strength of the main channel increases with respect to that of the eavesdropper channel .",
    "in addition to security issues , providing acceptable performance and quality is vital to many applications .",
    "for instance , voice over ip ( voip ) and interactive - video ( e.g , .",
    "videoconferencing ) systems are required to satisfy certain buffer or delay constraints . in this paper",
    ", we consider statistical qos constraints in the form of limitations on the buffer length , and incorporate the concept of effective capacity @xcite , which can be seen as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time - varying service process can support while satisfying statistical qos guarantees .",
    "the analysis and application of effective capacity in various settings have attracted much interest recently ( see e.g. , @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we define the _ effective secrecy throughput region _ as the maximum constant arrival rate pairs that can be supported while the service rate is confined by the secrecy capacity region .",
    "we assume that the channel side information is known at both the transmitter and receivers .",
    "then , following a similar analysis as shown in @xcite , we obtain the optimal power allocation policies that achieve points on the boundary of the effective secrecy throughput region .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly describes the system model and the necessary preliminaries on statistical qos constraints and effective capacity . in section iii , we present our main results on the optimal power control policies .",
    "finally , section iv concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a scenario in which a single transmitter broadcasts messages to two receivers .",
    "the transmitter wishes to send receiver 1 confidential messages that need to kept secret from receiver 2 , and also at the same time send common messages to both receivers .",
    "a depiction of the system model is given in figure [ fig : systemmodel ] .",
    "it is assumed that the transmitter generates data sequences which are divided into frames of duration @xmath0 .",
    "these data frames are initially stored in the buffer before they are transmitted over the wireless channel .",
    "the channel input - output relationships are given by @xmath1=h_1[i]x[i]+z_1[i]\\,\\text{and}\\,y_2[i]=h_2[i]x[i]+z_2[i]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the frame index , @xmath3 $ ] is the channel input in the @xmath2th frame , and @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] represent the channel outputs at the receivers 1 and 2 at frame @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath6,\\ , j=1,2\\}$ ] s are jointly stationary and ergodic discrete - time processes , and we denote the magnitude - square of the fading coefficients by @xmath7=|h_j[i]|^2 $ ] . considering that receiver 1 is the main user to which we send both the common and confidential messages , while receiver 2 , to which we send only the common messages , can be regarded as an eavesdropper for the confidential messages , we replace @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 to increase the clarity in the subsequent formulations .",
    "the channel input is subject to an average power constraint @xmath12|^2\\ } \\le { \\bar{p}}$ ] , and we assume that the bandwidth available for the system is @xmath13 . above ,",
    "@xmath14 $ ] is a zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath15|^2\\ } = n_j$ ] .",
    "the additive gaussian noise samples @xmath16\\}$ ] are assumed to form an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) sequence .",
    "note that we denote the average transmitted signal - to - noise ratio with respect to receiver 1 as @xmath17 .",
    "we also denote @xmath18 $ ] as the instantaneous transmit power in the @xmath2th frame .",
    "now , the instantaneous transmitted snr level for receiver 1 becomes @xmath19=\\frac{p[i]}{n_1 b}$ ] .",
    "then , the average power constraint at the base station is equivalent to the average snr constraint @xmath20\\}\\le { { \\text{\\footnotesize{snr}}}}$ ] for receiver 1 . if we denote the ratio between the noise powers of the two channels as @xmath21 , the instantaneous transmitted snr level for receiver 2 becomes @xmath22=\\gamma\\mu^1[i]$ ] .",
    "we denote @xmath23 as the vector composed of the channel states for receivers 2 and 1 . under the block fading assumption",
    ", the maximal instantaneous service rate is decided by the secrecy capacity region of the gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages ( bcc ) for each interval with a pair of specific channel states realizations @xmath24 .",
    "we define @xmath25 as the power allocation policies for the common and confidential messages , respectively .",
    "we denote the region @xmath26 as the region in which both confidential and common messages are transmitted .",
    "@xmath27 represents the region where @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 lies in @xmath27 , only the common messages are transmitted .",
    "note that @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we then define the set @xmath32 as the power allocation policies satisfying the power constraints @xmath33    with the above notations , the secrecy capacity region of the fading bcc is given by @xcite    @xmath34      in @xcite , wu and negi defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a statistical qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath35 .",
    "if we define @xmath36 as the stationary queue length , then @xmath35 is the decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length @xmath36 : @xmath37 therefore , for large @xmath38 , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability : @xmath39 .",
    "hence , while larger @xmath35 corresponds to more strict qos constraints , smaller @xmath35 implies looser qos guarantees .",
    "similarly , if @xmath40 denotes the steady - state delay experienced in the buffer , then @xmath41 for large @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is determined by the arrival and service processes @xcite .",

    "@xmath46 , i=1,2,\\ldots\\}$ ] denote the discrete - time stationary and ergodic stochastic service process .",
    "we define the effective capacity region obtained when the service rate is confined by the secrecy capacity region as the _ effective secrecy throughput region_.    in this paper , in order to simplify the analysis while considering general fading distributions , we assume that the fading coefficients stay constant over the frame duration @xmath0 and vary independently for each frame and each user . in this scenario ,",
    "@xmath47=t r[i]$ ] , where @xmath48 $ ] is the instantaneous service rate for common or confidential messages in the @xmath2th frame duration @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "then , ( [ eq : effectivedefi ] ) can be written as @xmath50}\\}\\,\\quad \\text{bits / s } , \\label{eq : effectivedefirate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 $ ] denotes the instantaneous rate sequence with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "( [ eq : effectivedefirate ] ) is obtained using the fact that instantaneous rates @xmath51\\}$ ] vary independently .",
    "the _ effective secrecy throughput _",
    "normalized by bandwidth @xmath13 is @xmath52",
    "in this section , we investigate the fading broadcast channel with confidential message ( bcc ) by incorporating the statistical qos constraints .",
    "et al . _ in @xcite have shown that the fading channel can be viewed as a set of parallel subchannels with each corresponding to one fading state . in @xcite",
    ", it has been assumed that no delay constraints are imposed on the transmitted messages .",
    "under such an assumption , the ergodic secrecy capacity region is determined and the optimal power allocation policies achieving the boundary of the capacity region are identified .    in this paper , we analyze the performance under statistical buffer constraints by considering the effective capacity formulation . according to the formula for effective capacity ( [ eq : effectivedefirate ] ) , we first have the following result .    the effective secure throughput region of the fading bcc is @xmath53}\\},\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{3cm}\\text{subject to } \\ , \\forall { \\mathbb{e}}\\{\\mathbf{r}\\}\\in \\mathcal{c}_s\\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the vector composed of the instantaneous rates for the common and confidential messages , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath55 can take any possible value defined in the ergodic secrecy capacity region @xmath56 .",
    "since the secrecy capacity region is convex @xcite , we can easily prove the following .",
    "the effective secrecy throughput region is convex .    _",
    "proof : _ let the two effective capacity pairs @xmath57 and @xmath58 belong to @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , there exists some @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . by a time sharing strategy , for any @xmath64 , we know that @xmath65+(1-\\alpha)\\mathbf{r'}[i]\\}\\in\\mathcal{r}_{s}$ ] .",

    "the inequality in the last stage follows from hlder s inequality .",
    "hence , @xmath67 still lies in the _ throughput region_.",
    "@xmath68    then , the points on the boundary surface of the effective throughput region @xmath69 can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem @xmath70 where @xmath71 is any vector in @xmath72 .",
    "the optimal power allocation policies for the above problem can be solved using a similar approach as in @xcite , which is stated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) as well . note that due to the introduction of qos constraints , the service rate is limited by the channel conditions while the maximization is over the effective throughput .",
    "we first have the following result .    the optimal @xmath73 that solves ( [ eq : optproblem ] ) falls into the one of the following three cases : @xmath74 above , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the two terms that @xmath77 can take in the minimization in ( [ eq : cregion ] ) , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the associated effective throughput values .",
    "next , we derive the optimal power allocation @xmath73 that solves ( [ eq : optproblem ] ) for the different cases detailed above .",
    "note that the maximal confidential message rate is defined as @xmath80    * case i * : the maximal instantaneous common message rate is given by the rate of receiver 1 @xmath81 as long as the obtained power control policy satisfies @xmath82    then , the lagrangian is given by    @xmath83    with specific power control policies , the values of @xmath84 are determined .",
    "hence , we can define the following @xmath85 although implicitly , @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the other cases in the following analysis can be defined similarly .",
    "these two equations can be viewed as additional constraints that the power control policies need to satisfy , i.e. , the right hand side ( rhs ) of the two equations are also functions of @xmath88 , denoted as @xmath89 , since the power control policies @xmath90 depend on @xmath88 .",
    "now that @xmath86 and @xmath87 take values from @xmath91 $ ] and the rhs function takes values from @xmath91 $ ] , we can find the solution through an iterative algorithm according to the fixed - point theorem or @xmath87 taking value 0 or 1 will at the same time turn out to be some value in ( 0,1 ) for the function @xmath89 , which tells us that the solution of @xmath86 or @xmath87 is in ( 0,1 ) . ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath92 are the solutions to the following @xmath93 where ( [ eq : optcond1])-([eq : optcond3 ] ) are obtained by taking the derivative of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath95 for @xmath96 , @xmath95 for @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for @xmath99 , respectively . whenever @xmath95 and @xmath98 turn out to have negative values through these equations , they are set to 0 according to the convexity of the optimization problem .",
    "although the closed form expressions for @xmath92 are hard to find , we can get some insight by examining ( [ eq : optcond1])-([eq : optcond3 ] ) . define @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which are chosen to satisfy the average power constraint ( [ eq : avgpower ] ) with equality .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath95 in @xmath27 behaves similarly as in point - to - point transmission @xcite .",
    "now , consider ( [ eq : optcond3 ] ) . in order for @xmath98 to have a nonnegative value",
    ", the following should be satisfied @xmath102 if @xmath103 , we have from ( [ eq : optcond3 ] ) that @xmath104 after a simple computation using([eq : optcond2 ] ) , we get @xmath105 which gives us that @xmath106 if @xmath107 this tells us that when the power allocated to confidential message is large enough , there should be no common message transmission . furthermore , substituting ( [ eq : optcond2 ] ) and ( [ eq : subscond2 ] ) into ( [ eq : optcond3 ] ) , we have    @xmath108    this is for the case when both @xmath95 and @xmath98 turn out to have positive values directly from the optimization condition equations .    the following algorithm can be used to determine the optimal power allocation :    given @xmath109 , obtain @xmath110 ; denote @xmath111 , @xmath112 ; @xmath113 compute @xmath98 from ( [ eq : subscond2 ] ) ; @xmath114 or @xmath115 @xmath103 ; @xmath116 compute @xmath98 from ( [ eq : subscond5]);substitute @xmath98 to ( [ eq : optcond2 ] ) to get @xmath95;@xmath117 , @xmath118^+$ ] ; @xmath117 , @xmath118^+$ ] ;    the optimal values @xmath110 can be numerically computed to satisfy the average power constraint .    with the above analysis of the optimal power allocation policy of @xmath92 ,",
    "the condition ( [ eq : case1cond ] ) essentially requires that the power allocated to @xmath98 is large such that the interference from sending confidential messages is stronger in the expression for @xmath75 , i.e. , higher effective secrecy throughput .",
