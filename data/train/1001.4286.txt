    "one result for a micro or nano - mechanical array is that a localized nonlinear excitation called an intrinsic localized mode ( ilm ) can be generated.@xcite some ideas@xcite and applications@xcite for vibrational localization in small scale arrays have already been proposed .",
    "experimental and simulation studies with micromechanical arrays have shown that in the nonlinear regime a steady state ilm can be produced by chirping the frequency of the driver@xcite beyond the plane wave spectrum and then maintaining it there with a cw oscillator at constant amplitude.@xcite the resulting locked ilm is stable at a lattice site , and can be moved from one place to another by introducing a mobile impurity in the array.@xcite the interaction between an ilm and a vibrational impurity mode makes such motion possible . by using vibrational impurity mode dynamics a number of different processes",

    "a stationary ilm can be created above the band states by using a chirped driver .",
    "when an impurity mode frequency is also above the band state frequencies but below the ilm frequency the ilm is attracted to it .",

    "@xcite , fig . 9 . )",
    "two sets of frequency differences are important for the impurity mode control of the ilm .",
    "these are between the driver and the highest frequency pure - band state identified as @xmath0 and the frequency difference between the driver and the impurity mode called @xmath1 . since the ilm is locked to the driver it is stable at the frequency shift @xmath2 .",
    "when the ilm is near an impurity mode and @xmath3 , attraction occurs . in that case , the ilm releases some amplitude and becomes trapped at the impurity mode site . when the impurity mode is removed , the ilm amplitude is recovered .",
    "a sudden application of an impurity mode may end up un - locking the ilm from the driver and it will then disappear in an energy dissipation relaxation time ; hence , to maintain the locked ilm its change in amplitude should occur over a longer time interval than the damping time .    by employing simulations",
    "it is demonstrated in this report that an inhomogeneous , harmonic force constant , time dependent perturbation applied to a nonlinear lattice can be used to control ilms that are locked to a driver .",

    "the array is made from an alternative sequence of long and short cantilevers to insure coupling to the optic branch with the uniform acceleration force provided by a pzt transducer .",

    "the initial ilm is attracted to island modes of larger and larger amplitude shifting it towards the local mode at center of the disturbance ( site 111 ) .",
    "notice the interesting result that the ilm crosses the disturbance center due to its translational inertia and oscillates about that  equilibrium \" position .",
    "at the same time , the am of the nonlinear mode at the disturbance center begins to grow in amplitude .",

    "often one signal is used many times in general logic circuits .",
    "the signal is simply branched in such circuit diagrams ; however , in the nonlinear array for the ilm operation , each ilm signal must be prepared before the operation .",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows such a process for two triangular disturbances that slightly overlap . in this case two ilms appear although only one is initially present .",
    "+    branches are often seen in circuit diagrams and the crossing of circuit lines may exist at many locations .",
    "no interaction occurs between two crossing lines . for the one - dimensional nonlinear array",
    ", this corresponds to moving one ilm signal from a site to the other side of another ilm signal position .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows such a case .",
    "the ilm signal at site 55 propagates to site 99 , and that initially on site 123 is transmitted to site 79 .",
    "two transient phenomena have been observed in the production or destruction of an ilm .",
    "( 1 ) oscillation of the frequency locked ilm around the point of maximum disturbance and ( 2 ) transient amplitude modulation.@xcite the first signature indicates that the ilm has translational inertial while the source of the second effect is more subtle .    for a linear oscillator",
    "the am frequency is the difference frequency between the driver and the oscillator , i.e. , @xmath20khz , but the observed am oscillation frequency in the cases presented here is @xmath31 khz . in addition , the lifetime of the am ( @xmath32 periods ) is longer than the damping time , @xmath33 periods .",
    "thus , the observed am can not be explained by a simple linear calculation , instead it must be strongly influenced by the nonlinear effect .",
    "such am has already been observed in the sideband spectrum of driver locked ilms@xcite and has been identified with a low frequency deformation mode of the ilm itself.@xcite the oscillation parametrically receives energy from the main driver so this parasitic oscillation has a longer lifetime than for the linear case .",
    "the added translational component observed here may be the source of the large am depth .",
    "bistability of a driver locked ilm is a known property@xcite and such bistability is also known to occur for a duffing oscillator.@xcite by using the ilm eigenvector and a transformation method described in ref . @xcite and integrating along the array ( not along the cantilever ) , a duffing model has been created with effectively the same parameters as used in the above simulations .",
    "similar to the array case , locked and unlocked final states appear alternatively when the perturbation removal time is changed by 1/2 the am period .",
    "thus , one nonlinear oscillator with a fixed driver is sufficient to have both amplitude modulation and two end results , namely , locked and un - locked states .",
    "even if amplitude oscillation and bistability are explained by the single nonlinear oscillator model , the multiple input operation demonstrated here requires many degrees of freedom . since the end result is sensitive to the phase of the am of the ilm , logic operations are possible as long as a method to modify the am phase can be found .",
    "the triangular disturbance has a definite advantage for controlling ilms .",
    "since the locked ilm has fixed excitation amplitude , interaction of two nearby ilms usually causes repulsion interaction between them .",
    "the strong repulsion often ends up producing the no ilm result .",
    "although a single impurity mode may also manipulate ilms , the triangular disturbance has an advantage in terms of multiple ilm interactions because interactions will occur over a larger region of space .",
    "one question is how to make the operations shown here work for a large 1-d array . in this case ,",
    "multiple ilm interactions are possible .",
    "ideally , there should be no interaction during the crossing ; however , locked ilms are stationary stable and strongly interact when they cross each other .",
    "more desirable would be a localized excitation with a weaker interaction during a rapid crossing so that swapping would be easier . because solitons do not interact with each other and because solitons run while ilms",
    "do not , converting an ilm into a soliton and then after the swap converting the soliton back to an ilm , would make the swapping operation highly reliability in a large array .",
    "just exactly how to engineer such a process is not yet clear although the results in ref .",
    "@xcite may provide clues .",
    "so far it appears that handling the ilm - ilm interaction between stationary stable ilm is much simpler than dealing with the still to be explored ilm - soliton interaction .",
    "logic operations inverter and nor have been demonstrated in simulations involving a cantilever array .",
    "the triangular spatial perturbation to the array vibrational dynamics operated off - center to the initial ilm state inverts the existence or absence of the ilm .",
    "the operation is explained by a phase shift of the am produced by the attraction of the initial ilm(s ) and the growing ( or decaying ) array of impurity modes produced by the time dependent perturbation .",
    "any kind of logic operation can be achieved by combinations of the inverter and nor .",
    "the operations shown here are based on the transient response am together with the bistability of this duffing - like oscillator .",
    "such a process also would be expected to occur in other kind of mems oscillator arrays .",
    "finally this proof of principle study of possible logic operations may apply to actuator arrays and sensor arrays .",
    "if and when lattice dynamics ilms in condensed matter systems can be manipulated then information processing may also be possible .",
