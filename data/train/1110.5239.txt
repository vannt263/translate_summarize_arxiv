    "the goal of this note is to establish a close relationship between two a priori unrelated problems : the existence of homogeneous artinian ideals @xmath3 $ ] which fail the weak lefschetz property ; and the existence of ( smooth ) projective varieties @xmath4 satisfying at least one laplace equation of order @xmath5 .",
    "these are two longstanding problems which as we will see lie at the crossroads between commutative algebra , algebraic geometry , differential geometry and combinatorics .    a @xmath6-dimensional projective variety @xmath4 is said to satisfy @xmath7 independent laplace equations of order @xmath8 if its @xmath8-osculating space at a general point @xmath9 has dimension @xmath10 .",

    "one would naively expect this property to hold , and so it is interesting to find classes of artinian ideals failing wlp , and to understand what is from a geometric point of view that prevents this property from holding .",

    ". a famous result of togliatti ( see @xcite ; or @xcite ) proves that there is only one non - trivial ( in a sense to be precise in section [ monomial case ] ) example of surface @xmath18 obtained by projecting the veronese surface @xmath19 and satisfying a single laplace equation of order 2 ; @xmath20 is projectively equivalent to the image of @xmath21 via the linear system @xmath22 .",
    "note that the linear system of cubics given by brenner and kaid s example @xmath23 is apolar to the linear system of cubics given in togliatti s example .",

    "part of the great interest in the wlp stems from the fact that its presence puts severe constraints on the possible hilbert functions , which can appear in various disguises ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
