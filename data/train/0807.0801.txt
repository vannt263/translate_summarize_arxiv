    "in the standard model , renormalizability restricts the possible sources of flavour violations to only one matrix , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "its almost diagonal structure ( like the values of all the other free parameters of the model ) remains unexplained .    in extensions of the standard model , as soon as new degrees of freedom appear",
    ", the possibilities to generate transitions among flavours increase very rapidly , and may give rise to a richer phenomenology than what the standard model alone would allow .",
    "the wealth of recent experimental results produced at kaon and @xmath1 factories shows , however , that if new degrees of freedom exist just above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , their influence on low - energy flavour physics is smaller than one would naively expect , below the current experimental sensitivity .",
    "this imposes a nontrivial constraint for model building , and forces one to impose some sort of protection against flavour violations .",
    "a convenient way to do this , without excluding completely the possibility to have new effects in flavour physics , is the principle of minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to this , even in extensions of the standard model ,",
    "the only source of flavour violations is in the yukawa matrices , and since one of them can always be diagonalized , in the ckm matrix . in its latest , more complete implementation , the principle is formulated as a symmetry : one starts from the observation that the large global flavour symmetry group of the standard model in the absence of the yukawa couplings is saved even in their presence if they are promoted to the status of spurions , i.e. if they are assigned transformation properties under the flavour group .",
    "the principle of mfv requires that the same symmetry holds even in extensions of the standard model ",
    "the only allowed spurions being the yukawa matrices .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with minimal field content and exact r - parity ( mssm ) ( for a nice introduction , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and discuss the principle of mfv within this framework .",
    "our main points are :    1 .",
    "we observe that , if one considers the yukawa matrices as dimension - zero spurions , and allows any power of them to appear in local operators , imposing mfv on the mssm does not restrict the number of free parameters of the model , but amounts to a mere reparametrization .",
    "still , if one requires that the coupling constant of the model are of order one , some of them are irrelevant for the phenomenology and can therefore be dropped .",
    "2 .   in order to decide systematically which terms are irrelevant and which ones should be kept ,",
    "we find it convenient to introduce a counting rule , and use as expansion parameter @xmath2 , the cabibbo angle .",
    "we use this expansion parameter to take into account not only the highly hierarchical ckm matrix , but also the highly hierarchical quark and lepton masses .",
    "each of the mfv parameters will therefore be assigned an order in @xmath2  once one has set the accuracy of its calculation to a certain level , @xmath3 , it is immediate to see which mfv parameters should be kept .",
    "3 .   since imposing mfv amounts to a mere reparametrization of the generic mssm ,",
    "it is obvious that the principle is renormalization group ( rg ) invariant  what is not guaranteed is that the coefficients will keep their order in @xmath2 during the running .",
    "we will rewrite the renormalization group equations ( rge ) in mfv form , checking that the beta functions also respect the same counting rules as the parameters themselves .",
    "as such , this is only a necessary , but not yet sufficient condition to prove that the mfv principle is truly rge invariant .",
    "we will therefore study the solutions of the rge numerically , and show that indeed they respect the counting rules when evolving from the high to the low scale  none of the irrelevant parameters at the high scale may become so large during the rg evolution that it becomes of phenomenological importance at the low scale .",
    "we will also show that the converse is not true : generic mfv - like boundary conditions at the low scale will not necessarily evolve to a mfv - like mssm at the high scale .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the mfv hypothesis in the mssm is valid at different scales makes it even more restrictive at the low scale .",
    "we discuss in detail the possible new cp - violating phases allowed by the mfv hypothesis , and analyze their behaviour under the running .",
    "we show that they tend to vanish at the low scale  how fast they do that depends on the initial conditions at the high scale .",
    "while this paper was being completed , a preprint appeared which also analyzes the behaviour of mfv models under running @xcite .",
    "there , the numerical analysis is performed with the help of softsusy @xcite , one of the available codes which allow one to run the mssm with a generic flavour structure according to the full rge to two loops . in this paper , the authors start with mfv - compatible initial conditions at the gut scale , evolve all the parameters down to the electroweak scale , and project back the model on the mfv parameters , with the help of a fit .",
    "their analysis is valid for moderate @xmath0 , and only for real mfv coefficients . in this manner ,",
    "they find out that the mfv parameters have quasi fixed points at the low scale .",
    "we will confirm their finding , and also provide an analytical explanation for this behaviour .",
    "furher , we will perform the analysis also for large @xmath0 , and in the presence of new cp - violating phases in the mfv expansions .",
    "gauge interactions in the standard model are flavour blind .",
    "if one sets the yukawa matrices to zero , the standard model becomes invariant under a large global symmetry group @xmath4^{5}$ ] @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 the five @xmath7 factors have been decomposed in the three which remain a symmetry even in the presence of yukawa interactions ( related to baryon and lepton number and hypercharge ) , and the remaining two .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we write these as a phase transformation affecting @xmath8 and @xmath9 at the same time , the peccei - quinn symmetry of the two - higgs doublet model ( denoted here by @xmath10 ) and one affecting only @xmath9 .",
    "the yukawa matrices break @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 . as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the standard model remains formally invariant under @xmath14 in the presence of the yukawa matrices if these are promoted to spurion fields transforming as @xmath15 and @xmath16 the symmetry is broken whenever the yukawa matrices are frozen at a certain value  on the other hand , different forms of the yukawa matrices which are related by @xmath17 and @xmath18 transformations are physically equivalent . in what follows , we will choose the following background values@xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the ckm matrix .",
    "an extension of the standard model is said to respect mfv if it is symmetric under @xmath14 in the presence of yukawa spurions . while new matter fields in such an extension are of course allowed , one is not supposed to introduce new spurion fields beyond the yukawa matrices .      in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model ,",
    "the superpotential automatically satisfy the mfv principle . on the other hand",
    ", mfv strongly constrains the soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "we will illustrate this statement by considering the mass term for the left - handed squarks @xmath24 and showing first that mfv amounts in principle to a reparametrization of a generic hermitian @xmath25 matrix , and later that if one excludes the possibility of having enormous coupling constants , mfv is indeed quite constraining .",
    "mfv requires this term to become formally invariant under @xmath17 , hence it must transform like @xmath26 .",
    "since we are not allowed to introduce new spurions , we have to obtain this transformation property with the help of the yukawa matrices , as with terms like @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , one can construct invariants under @xmath17 also with the help of @xmath29-tensors .",
    "such terms have recently been systematically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and permit to extend the mfv principle to the r - parity violating interactions .",
    "interestingly , mfv alone is then sufficient to prevent the proton from decaying too rapidly  a fact which lends additional support to the validity of the mfv hypothesis at low energy .    for the r - parity conserving sector of the mssm , on which we concentrate in the present paper , these @xmath30-tensor terms",
    "have been shown to be very suppressed @xcite .",
    "hence , ignoring them altogether , mfv permits to write @xmath31 as the infinite sum : @xmath32 actually , the infinite sum collapses on its first few terms : the yukawa couplings are @xmath25 matrices , hence they respect the corresponding cayley - hamilton identities .",

    "further , identities involving two ( or more ) different combinations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 say , can be found by substituting @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ch1 ] ) and extracting a given power of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for example , a relevant identity is@xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    taking into account these identities ,",
    "the most general expression for @xmath31 respecting mfv becomes @xmath47 with the @xmath48 being real parameters .",
    "a generic @xmath25 hermitian matrix can be described by nine real constants  in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mq2 g ] ) , @xmath31 is expressed in terms of seventeen real constants , so that eight of them must be linearly dependent .",
    "even if we do not specify the linear relations which allow one to eliminate eight of these constants , it is clear that mfv amounts to a mere reparametrization of the soft susy - breaking terms of the mssm , since the original expansion in eq .",
    "( [ jwhk ] ) contains a basis and the cayley - hamilton relations are exact .",
    "a similar argument can be used also for all other terms .",
    "what is special about the mfv parametrization is that if all the @xmath48 s are of the same order of magnitude , the structure of @xmath31 is highly non - generic .",
    "conversely , if one writes down a generic @xmath31 matrix and projects it on the mfv basis , the coefficients @xmath48 so obtained will typically span many orders of magnitude .",
    "we define extensions of the standard model respecting mfv by the additional requirement that the coefficients appearing in front of the various mfv terms are of the same order of magnitude .      if one takes all the @xmath48 coefficients to be of the same order of magnitude , several of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mq2 g ] ) ( and in the analogous ones for the other soft susy - breaking terms ) can be disposed of . in this subsection",
    ", we will discuss how to do this in a systematic way , and will argue that it is more convenient to change basis in order to work with mfv .",
    "for example , taking into account the actual values of the yukawa coefficients of the up , charm and top quarks , we conclude that the two matrices @xmath49 are proportional to each other up to a correction of relative order @xmath50 , @xmath51 which is usually neglected since @xmath52 .",

    "the analysis of the previous section points to a possible way out : if the ratio @xmath322 were of order one instead of @xmath335 , much larger changes in the low energy mfv parameters would become possible .",

    "this , however , brings us far away from the sps-1a point , and moreover , will tend to make the squarks heavier , which makes their contribution to low - energy flavour violations , and correspondingly the phenomenological interest , smaller .",
    "such a situation is similar to the one realized in the case of the sps-4 points ( independently of the size of @xmath0 ) , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "we conclude that , if the spectrum at the low scale corresponds to the sps-1a input at the high scale ( note that the rge s discussed here show that an mfv - compatible change of the boundary conditions at the high scale has barely any influence on the spectrum ) , and if the values of the mfv parameters measured at the low scale are far away from those given in table  [ tab : sps1 ] , then the mfv hypothesis has to break down somewhere before reaching the gut scale .",
    "this may indicate that either mfv has emerged from the rge evolution of the parameters , starting from a non mfv kind of mssm , or that the mfv parameters have a dynamical origin at a scale much lower than the gut scale .",
    "the former solution can not be really investigated with our simplified rge s , because if any of the mfv parameters is far from its assumed order , our rge s lose their accuracy .",
    "one would have to study this solution with the full rge s , and see how much fine - tuned it is , or whether it can viewed as natural in any sense .",

    "another important aspect is that @xmath85 is set to zero at the gut scale , and so @xmath344 there . if we want to vary the flavour violating parameters in the trilinear couplings , we first need to define a scale of naturalness for them . for this",

    "[ fig : sps4 ] .",
    "this is confirmed with the help of the analytical solutions , and table  [ tab : sps4 ] .",
    "consider for example @xmath387 , which now depends ten times more strongly than in the sps-1a case on its initial condition @xmath388 . if we ignore for a moment that the beta function of @xmath101 also receives a contribution from @xmath121 and @xmath106 , which are potentially large , and evaluate the coefficient in front of @xmath242 in the seventh row of table  [ tab : sps4 ] with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : x12ic ] ) we get : @xmath389 in perfect agreement with the number in the table .",
    "the reason for the enhanced sensitivity to the initial conditions is due to the less strong growth of @xmath390 in going from the gut to the electroweak scale  the extra dependence on the initial conditions of @xmath101 coming from the terms proportional to @xmath121 and @xmath391 is negligible , as we have explicitly checked ( the reason can be understood rather easily : the @xmath91 s depend on @xmath101 through the beta function and vice - versa  so the extra dependence of @xmath387 on its initial conditions at the gut scale comes in through the beta function of the beta function and is therefore suppressed by two powers of @xmath392 ) .",
    "in fact , even the value of @xmath387 for initial conditions of the msugra type can be understood rather well on the basis of the analytical formulae obtained in the case of moderate @xmath0 : the relation @xmath301 holds to better than one percent and eq .",

    "in this paper , we have revisited the formulation of minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) within minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( mssm ) , and linked it to a counting rule which keeps track of the hierarchies in the yukawa couplings and in the ckm matrix in a coherent way .",
    "this allowed us to move continuously and in a controlled manner , between the moderate and the large @xmath0 case , keeping control over the expected order of magnitude of the different terms .",
    "we have argued that to implement these counting rules in an efficient way , it is convenient to express the soft susy breaking terms of the mssm in a different basis than in the conventional mfv . in order to study the renormalization group equations of the mfv parameters ,",
    "we have projected the beta functions of the soft susy breaking terms on this basis and checked that the beta functions obey the same counting rules as the coefficients themselves .",
    "we have then studied the behaviour of the running of the mfv parameters numerically , and first checked that this reproduces the full running with mfv boundary conditions at the level of accuracy at which we expected them to work .    in the moderate @xmath0 case",
    ", we were able to provide approximate analytical solutions to the rge s of the mfv parameters , and we discussed , in the case of the sps-1a benchmark point , the behaviour of the mfv parameters under the running .",
    "we confirmed the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite about a quasi fixed - point behaviour of these , and could explain it in detail with the help of our analytical solutions .",
    "the crucial observation is that the flavour blind part of the soft susy - breaking terms , the @xmath78 parameters , run fast , like the gluino masses , whereas all the terms with a nontrivial flavour structure ( the @xmath86 s , in our basis ) grow less rapidly  their beta functions do not contain the gaugino masses , but at best the @xmath78 s .",
    "this hierarchy in the beta functions explains why the ratios of the flavour - violating parameters to the flavour - blind ones tend to a small , finite value at the low scale .",
    "the only possibility we have identified to avoid this , and to make a larger range of values at the low scale at all possible , is to increase the value of the @xmath78 s at the gut scale  this , however , makes the squark masses heavier , which in turn suppresses flavour violations at low energies .",
    "our analysis of the sps-4 benchmark point , which has @xmath342 , shows that the picture does not change substantially for large @xmath0 .",
    "more parameters ( the @xmath91 s in our notation ) may become of order one , but their rge s are not particularly different from those of the @xmath86 s ( they also contain at best the @xmath78 s in their beta functions , and do not grow as fast ) , nor do they influence the other parameters of order one in a substantial way .    the picture which emerges from this analysis is that , if mfv is valid and has its origin at the gut scale ( or at any other high scale much higher than the susy breaking one ) , then it is a much more constraining framework than if one assumes it to be valid just at the electroweak scale .",
    "this is particularly true for the cp - violating phases . throughout our study , we have allowed mfv coefficients to have imaginary parts , whenever allowed by the hermiticity of squark soft susy breaking mass terms .",
    "the first important observation is that mfv does allow for new cp - violating phases not only in the trilinear terms , but also in the ll sector .",
    "this latter phase could have significant impacts on the mfv predictions for @xmath125 and @xmath126 observables ( but not for @xmath127 ones , where it is absent ) .",
    "however , if mfv has its origin at the gut scale , and @xmath0 is not too large , we have shown that all the cp - violating phases are strongly suppressed at the low - scale .",
    "this behaviour is essentially unaltered when @xmath0 is large , though in that case , the initial conditions at the gut scale have to be modified .",
    "in particular , when squark soft susy breaking mass terms are as large as in the sps-4 benchmark point , the suppression is much less pronounced .    a final comment about leptons , which in this analysis have only played a marginal role .",
    "one can of course apply similar ideas in that sector also , as has been shown by ref .",
    ". moreover , if one considers a grand unified theory , one has a more constrained framework , and has relations between the mfv parameters in the lepton and in the quark sector  @xcite ( indeed , independently from any mfv hypothesis , the relations between the two sectors have interesting phenomenological implications , @xcite ) .",
    "while these connections are very interesting and worth investigating , they mostly concern the boundary conditions at the gut scale  the rge below the gut scale are the standard mssm ones . as a first analysis of the running of the mfv parameters , we therefore found it more convenient to concentrate ourselves only on the quark sector .",

    "<S> we revisit the formulation of the principle of minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , both at moderate and large @xmath0 , and with or without new cp - violating phases . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a counting rule which keeps track of the highly hierarchical structure of the yukawa matrices . in this manner , we are able to control systematically which terms can be discarded in the soft susy breaking part of the lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that for the implementation of this counting rule , it is convenient to introduce a new basis of matrices in which both the squark ( and slepton ) mass terms as well as the trilinear couplings can be expanded . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the rge for the mfv parameters and show that the beta functions also respect the counting rule . for moderate @xmath0 , we provide explicit analytic solutions of these rge and illustrate their behaviour by analyzing the neighbourhood ( also switching on new phases ) of the sps-1a benchmark point . we then show that even in the case of large @xmath0 , the rge remain valid and that the analytic solutions obtained for moderate @xmath0 still allow us to understand the most important features of the running of the parameters , as illustrated with the help of the sps-4 benchmark point . </S>"
