    "errors bars are at most @xmath144 of the value of the response function while for the largest ( @xmath145 ) , they increase up to @xmath146 .",
    "indeed , in the last case , the response function is of order of @xmath147 and so can not be sampled accurately .",
    "nevertheless , a fairly good collapse of the data is observed indicating that @xmath148 is indeed a scaling function ( actually we have used @xmath149 instead of @xmath150 but this has no consequence on the asymptotic behaviour ) .",
    "we computed the fd ratio @xmath7 using the estimator previously derived and whose expression is given by equation  ( [ eq32 ] ) .",
    "the error bars are quite large .",
    "the numerical data are plotted in figure  [ fig3 ] for the largest lattice size ( @xmath142 ) . in contradistinction to cugliandolo conjecture  ( [ intro2 ] ) , the inset of figure  [ fig3 ] shows that the fd ratio does not depend on time only through the correlation function .",
    "however , it seems that it may be the case in the limit @xmath151 . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that the fd ratio depends on time only through @xmath150 and reach a plateau for large enough values of @xmath1 that we may estimate roughly to be @xmath152 .",
    "the same value is obtained for @xmath153 and @xmath142 excluding any possibility of finite - size effects .",
    "the limit @xmath20 has been conjectured to be universal  @xcite but incompatible values have been given by different groups : @xmath154  @xcite and @xmath155  @xcite by monte carlo simulations and @xmath156  @xcite for the @xmath157-model in dimension @xmath158 .",
    "our estimate is compatible with the last two ones .",
    "the estimate @xmath154 has probably been measured for a too - short time @xmath1 , far from the region where cugliandolo conjecture  ( [ intro2 ] ) and thus equation  ( [ intro3 ] ) hold .",
    "this puts stress upon the danger of using equation  ( [ intro3 ] ) to compute the fd ratio .",
    "the same analysis can be done below @xmath18 . in this regime",
    ", the correlation function decays as  @xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the equilibrium magnetisation and @xmath161 a scaling function that asymptotically behaves as @xmath162 .",
    "the autocorrelation exponent @xmath163 and the dynamical exponent @xmath164 are expected to take values which are different from those at @xmath18 .",
    "the response function is expected to scale as  @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "a controversy exists concerning the value of @xmath19 that has been estimated to be either @xmath167  @xcite or @xmath168  @xcite .",
    "our numerical data are presented in the figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we studied lattice sizes only up to @xmath153 but calculations were made for two temperatures : @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the error bars are much smaller than in the critical case for small values of @xmath11 .",
    "the relative error is at most @xmath171 for @xmath143 at @xmath172 but increase faster with @xmath11 : the relative error increases up to @xmath173 for @xmath174 . as a consequence ,",
    "the study was limited to the values of @xmath11 ranging from @xmath143 to @xmath174 .",
    "the response function displays the expected scaling behaviour ( [ mc10 ] ) with @xmath175 .",
    "however , the collapse is not perfect , especially for the smallest values of @xmath11 but a very small variation of @xmath19 does not improve it significantly .",
    "the value @xmath176 in particular improves the collapse for the small values of @xmath11 only .",
    "the response function has probably strong corrections to scaling .",
    "note that corrections have already been taken into account for the study of the scaling behaviour of the integrated response function  @xcite .    combining the relations ( [ mc9 ] ) and ( [ mc10 ] ) , the fd ratio @xmath177 is predicted to vanish as @xmath178 below @xmath18 .",
    "our numerical estimates for @xmath179 are plotted in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the statistical errors decrease with the temperature so that the data are less fluctuating than at @xmath18 . as expected , the fd ratio is equal to @xmath180 for small values of @xmath40 , signalling that the main contribution to the response function is due to equilibrium processes . on the other hand ,",
    "it vanishes in the limit @xmath181 as @xmath182 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , the data for @xmath183 collapse for large values of @xmath150 .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig5 ] shows unambiguously that the fd ratio does not depend on time only through the correlation function .",
    "this makes the relation  ( [ intro3 ] ) invalid .",
    "the study of the violation of the equilibrium fdt by the usual method relying on the equation  ( [ intro3 ] ) would have led to erroneous values of the fd ratio .",
    "using a formalism similar to kubo s one in the quantum case , we derive an exact expression of the response function of an ising - glauber - like model far - from - equilibrium ( equation  ( [ eq22 ] ) ) . at least for finite systems ,",
    "the dynamics of our model is equivalent to the glauber dynamics up to a time - renormalisation @xmath60 .",
    "the derivation is possible because the dynamics consists in a sequential update of the spins and the transition rate under a magnetic field can be written as a product of the transition rate without magnetic field and of a term depending only on the final spin configuration .",
    "the response function turns out to be related to time - derivatives of a correlation function involving the fluctuations of the spin excited by the magnetic field around its equilibrium average in its weiss field . in this sense , the expression is a generalisation of the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation .",
    "our expression is quite general : no assumption has been made during its derivation on the dimension of the space , the set of exchange couplings or the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , it can be easily extended to other classical models .",
    "generalised and non - linear response functions can be obtained analogously .",
    "however , the continuous - time expression  ( [ eq22 ] ) may not hold in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "analytic results would be desirable .",
    "unfortunately , the response function calculated for the ising - chain by glauber itself in his original paper  @xcite does not help because the magnetic field was coupled differently to the system ( by a multiplicative factor to make the calculation feasible while we coupled the field by a modification of the transition rate corresponding to the addition of the zeeman interaction in the equilibrium probability distribution ) .",
    "generalisation to the ising - glauber model is not trivial because equation @xmath184 sets a constrain on the sequence of spin - flips .",
    "nevertheless , it is tempting to imagine that like the equilibrium fdt @xmath184 , equations  ( [ eq22 ] ) to  ( [ eq22c ] ) hold for the ising - glauber model when suppressing this constrain on the sequence of spin - flips .    the expression  ( [ eq22 ] ) of the response function is then implemented in monte carlo simulations .",
    "our approach gives access to the response function and the fd ratio directly .",
    "in particular , the fd ratio can be obtained without assuming the validity of the cugliandolo conjecture  ( [ intro2 ] ) .",
    "we then study numerically the homogeneous two - dimensional ising - glauber model quenched from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic one .",
    "both the response function and the fd ratio display the expected scaling behaviour both at @xmath18 and below @xmath18 .",
    "the values , still controversial , of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are estimated to be equal to @xmath168 and @xmath185 respectively , in agreement with some previous works .",
    "the cugliandolo conjecture  ( [ intro2 ] ) does not hold for this model apart perhaps at @xmath18 in the limit of vanishing correlation functions .",
    "this would explain discrepancies of previous estimates of @xmath20 relying on cugliandolo conjecture .",
    "the above - presented numerical procedure may be extended to many different systems and would provided a unambiguous test of cugliandolo conjecture .",
    "we are currently studying the dynamics of spin - glasses in this framework .",
