    "in the high energy limit of hadron scattering , in the regime where the center of mass energy is larger than any other available scale , perturbative approach to processes with high momentum transfer allows factorization of the cross section into a hard matrix element with initial off - shell gluons and an unintegrated gluon density  @xcite . the unintegrated gluon density is a function of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 and transverse momentum @xmath2 of a gluon . after taking into account formally subleading corrections coming from coherence of gluon emissions ,",
    "one is lead to the ccfm set of equations  @xcite which introduce gluon density dependent on hard scale related to the probe as well as one introduces unintegrated quark densities .",
    "the status of phenomenological relevance of ccfm framework is not fully satisfactory . in principle",
    ", it is a set of equations that should be the ideal framework for application to final states at high energies and covering dglap and bfkl domains .",
    "it has been implemented in the monte carlo event generator @xcite .",
    "however , so far good agreement with high precision data has been successfully achieved only in rather inclusive processes like @xmath3 and drell - yan @xcite .",
    "it is known that on the theory side the ccfm physics is still to be completed .",
    "below we outline the main points .",
    "for instance :    * the ccfm system of equations has been so far solved in decoupled approximation in the , gluonic ( for short the equation for gluon density is usually called ccfm ) and non - singlet channels neglecting correlations between partons @xcite .",
    "this might result in improper treatment of the kinematical region where the gluon degrees of freedom are less dominant than sea quarks . since gluon",
    "might be artificially dominating over quarks where it should actually be suppressed .",
    "furthermore the corrections coming from inclusion of transversal momentum dependence to splitting functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not known and in order to have complete picture they should be calculated @xcite . * the impact of kinematical effects introducing energy conservation in the ccfm evolution have not been investigated in all detail . as it turns out from our study it is necessary to revisit the inclusion of the so called kinematical constraint  @xcite into the ccfm equation .",
    "the orgin of the kinematical constraint follows from refining the assumption that the @xmath6-channel off - shell gluon s @xmath7-momentum is dominated by @xmath8 .",
    "the kinematical constraint causes suppression of the gluon density and even overrides the angular ordering in regions of large @xmath2 .",
    "* only recently the ccfm has been promoted to non - linear equation@xcite therefore allowing for the possibility to investigate interplay of coherence effects and saturation @xcite in exclusive processes like dijet production at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in particular the important question is what is the role of the angular ordering and kinematical effect in the evolution at the non - linear level .",
    "the optimal form of initial conditions is also not known .",
    "this publication is a continuation of the work done in  @xcite .",
    "we compare numerically forms of non - sudakov form factor used in the literature and solve the full ccfm equation and its non - linear extension  including the @xmath9 pole and kinematical constraint in the kernel of the equation i.e. not only in the non - sudakov form factor .",
    "however we keep @xmath10 constant in order to have clear picture of the role of the kinematical effects .",

    "the ccfm equation for gluon density reads : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the moduli of the two dimensional vectors transversal to the collision plane are denoted @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath1 is gluon s longitudinal momentum fraction and @xmath15 .",
    "also the rescaled momentum is introduced as @xmath16 .",
    "+ the splitting function assumes the form : @xmath17    the sudakov form - factor evaluated in double logarithmic approximation reads : @xmath18    the non - sudakov form - factor regularizing @xmath19 singularity in angular ordered region is : @xmath20      the integration over @xmath21 in the equation  , although being constrained from below by the soft cut - off @xmath22 , is not constrained by an upper limit thus violating the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "moreover in the low @xmath1 formalism one requires that in the denominator of the off - shell gluon propagator one keeps terms that obey @xmath23 . in order to be consistent as argued in @xcite the non - sudakov form - factor should be accompanied by a kinematical constraint limiting the above integration over @xmath24 . in approximated form",

    "note , that for the full propagator @xmath38 , thus the full propagator causes stronger suppression of the amplitude which has to be taken into account when using @xmath28 .",

    "one imposes the kinematical constraint at the so called `` unresummed '' level on real emissions .",
    "however in @xcite it has been observed , at a level of bfkl equation , that imposing the kinematical constraint on unresummed equation and performing algebraic transformations leading to resummed equation one obtains a @xmath48-function affecting the full kernel .",

    "the ccfm equation has been promoted to non - linear equation by including a quadratic term @xcite which reads : @xmath54 where we also included the kinematical constraint of the form in the kernel .",
    "simpler versions of the equation above have been already analyzed in  @xcite and it has been observed that    * the equation leads to phenomenon called saturation at the saturation scale @xcite * the saturation strongly suppresses the gluon density at low @xmath1 and low @xmath0    the natural question arises how are these results modified when some of the approximations are not taken and how are they modified if the kinematical effect is imposed in the full form .",

    "the choices of the starting scale are motivated by a possibility to compare the equations in a region where both linear and non - linear equations are phenomenologically relevant .",
    "we use an initial condition which includes resummed virtual and unresolved contributions , according to  @xcite and  @xcite , in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the regge form - factor .    the first observation we make from the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots1d-1][fig : plots1d-3 ] is that the solutions of equations we study differ significantly .",

    "the positions of local maximum in the plots of @xmath61 dependence are correlated with the value of @xmath0 , with a shift to higher @xmath0 for the solution of the equation  .",
    "the peak can be explained by the fact that the contribution of the integral on the right hand side of   peaks at around @xmath62 . to point out : the peak is a result of presence of @xmath63  angular ordering condition .",
    "similar peaks are present also in the plots of @xmath0 dependence and resemble sudakov suppression of @xmath0 scales of the order of @xmath61 in case of equation   @xcite . however , in the case of   it seems , that the position of the peak does not depend on the value of @xmath61 .",
    "it seems that the kernel with the kinematical constraint included in an implicit way   produces similar effect , though weaker , as an implicit inclusion of the @xmath48-function only in the case of @xmath61 dependence , but for the @xmath0 dependence leads to much smaller suppression .",
    "thus the peak observed in solution of   is buried under the result of the evolution .",
    "we can conclude that the peak in the @xmath0 dependence is a result of an interplay of the inclusion of the explicit @xmath47 factor and the sudakov effect .",
    "we set the parameter characterizing the strength of the non - linear term @xmath64 the value @xmath65gev in the equation  .    by comparing the ccfm and kgbjs equations we see that the equations give quite similar distributions .",
    "this effect ( for our choice of the starting scale @xmath22 ) comes from the fact that the kinematical constraint suppresses the growth of the gluon so much that the non - linear effects enter only at very low @xmath1 .",
    "observations made in previous paragraphs are confirmed in 2-dimensional plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plots2d-1][fig : plots2d-2 ] ) , where we plot absolute relative difference of two amplitudes , solutions of the ccfm and the kgbjs equations , defined by the quantity @xmath66 the function @xmath67 , introduced before in  @xcite , can be used to measure the strength of the non - linear effects and to define a saturation scale using the condition : @xmath68 or @xmath61-related saturation scale : @xmath69    ( 30,0 ) ( 10 , -105 )    ( 222 , -105 )    ( 30,0 ) ( 10 , -105 )    ( 222 , -105 )    the conditions above can be seen as equipotential lines in the 2-dimensional plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots2d-1][fig : plots2d-2 ] where different equipotential lines correspond to different constants on the right - hand side of the equation above . the change in the slope of the @xmath70 at around @xmath71 reported in  @xcite , apparent in fig .",

    "[ fig : plots1d-1][fig : plots1d-2 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath73 the contribution of the integral on the right - hand side of the ccfm equation decreases and the gluon density is dominated by the initial condition .    by comparing the plots fig .",
    "[ fig : plots2d-1][fig : plots2d-2 ] to analogous plots in @xcite we see that their main features are very similar .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath74 approximation of the kgbjs and ccfm equations taken in @xcite does not , at least , modify the relative difference between linear and non - linear equation since the modifications of the kernel did not spoil the saturation pattern visible in the full equation .",

    "in particular we expect that the inclusion of the @xmath48-function is crucial for suppression of the cross section of emission of gluons in small angles since this configuration corresponds to large values of @xmath0 .",
