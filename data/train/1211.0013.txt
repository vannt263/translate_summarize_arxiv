    "a major development in observational astrophysics in recent years is the discovery that most , if not all , nearby elliptical galaxies host a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their center @xcite , and that the masses of the smbhs correlate tightly with the global properties of the spheroid components of their hosts , such as the stellar velocity dispersion ( the @xmath0 correlation , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the stellar masses ( the @xmath4 correlation , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these correlations suggest that the formation and evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies are closely linked ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of these scaling relations , however , remains a hot debate .",
    "a number of different models have been proposed to explain the correlations , such as feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn , e.g. , @xcite ) , gas competition between star formation and bh accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , galaxy mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a combination of merger and agn feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to unravel the origin of the correlations ,",
    "recent observational efforts have focused on their evolution in hope to identify the crucial physical processes in galaxy formation which give rise to the relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys suggest that there is either weak or no evolution in the @xmath0 relation up to @xmath5 , but there is a strong redshift evolution in the @xmath4 relation .",
    "however , it was also suggested that the relations between @xmath6 and total host - galaxy luminosity or stellar mass , @xmath1 , may not be evolving , or at least not as rapidly as the @xmath4 relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath4 and @xmath0 relations have different origins .",
    "more importantly , the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath1 provides a crucial clue on the origin and evolution of the mass scaling relation , because @xmath4 is closely connected to the formation of bulges , which is believed to result from major mergers @xcite , and thus depends strongly on redshift and the merging history of a galaxy @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath1 may simply reflect the growth of stars and bhs in a galaxy regardless its type .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 may represent a more fundamental property of galaxies . in this work , we adopt the latter as it is also easy to measure from the simulations .    theoretically , the evolution of the bh  host relations has been studied using numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and semi - analytical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these models differ in their predictions for the evolution of the scaling relations .",
    "in particular , @xcite employed a set of idealized merger simulations at various redshifts and found that the slope of the @xmath0 relation remains roughly constant at redshifts @xmath7 , but the normalization shows a weak redshift dependence .",
    "@xcite performed the first direct cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with bhs down to redshift @xmath8 , and found a weak redshift evolution in the normalization and slope of both correlations .",
    "@xcite also used a cosmological simulation but a different bh model and found that , while they reproduced the local correlations and the observed evolution of @xmath1 for massive galaxies , they predicted an evolution in the @xmath0 which contradicts with current observations .",
    "these studies have painted a confusing picture of the bh  host correlations .",
    "the confusion may come from the different samples used , and the different evolutionary stages of these galaxies .",
    "the galaxy samples used to derive the original correlations are dominated by local massive ellipticals and inactive galaxies .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the correlations vary with galaxy type and mass .",
    "@xcite showed different scaling relations for ellipticals and for spirals , and the latter have a larger intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0 relation than the ellipticals .",
    "@xcite suggested that the bh masses do not correlate with galaxy pseudobuldges or disks .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that , at the very high mass end , the bh masses derived from @xmath0 differ those from @xmath4 by nearly one order of magnitude .    at the low mass end ( @xmath9 ) , most of the observed galaxies are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . it was reported that , compared to inactive galaxies , agns show a larger dispersion in the @xmath0 relation , and that the slope differs from that of inactive galaxies or massive ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more interestingly , these authors found that while their samples show a large deviation from the `` classical '' @xmath0 relation , they seem to follow the @xmath4 relation .",
    "recently , @xcite compiled a sample of 26 quasars in the low - mass end ( @xmath10 ) , and found that the @xmath4 relation is consistent with that of the quiescent galaxies .    in order to understand the origin of the scaling relations , it is important to follow the formation and evolution of bhs and their host galaxies , in particular at the low - mass end , because these are the building blocks of the massive ones at the present day . based on our current understanding of structure formation in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology , the central bhs may follow the same hierarchical assembly of the galaxies as well .",
    "black holes in the mass range of @xmath11 thus serve as a bridge between the smbhs and their seeds , thus would provide crucial information on the growth of bhs .    in this work",
    ", we study the bh  host relations and their evolution in low mass systems using a high - resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation which includes important physics of dark matter , gas dynamics , star formation , black hole growth , and feedback processes .",
    "the simulation used the aquila initial condition @xcite , which was constructed to produce a milky way - size halo and its sub - structures ( referred to as `` aquila simulation '' hereafter ) .",
    "we also explore the origin of the relations by comparing model predictions with observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we describe our models and computational methods .",

    "the initial condition is originally from the aquarius project @xcite , which produced the largest ever particle simulation of a milky way - sized dark matter halo .",
    "the hydrodynamical initial condition is reconstructed from the original collisionless one by splitting each original particle into a dark matter and gas particle pair @xcite .",

    "star formation is modeled in a multi - phase ism , with a rate that follows the schmidt - kennicutt law ( @xcite ) .",
    "feedback from supernovae includes both thermal and kinetic forms .",
    "thermal feedback is captured through a multi - phase model of the ism by an effective equation of state for star - forming gas , and the kinetic feedback is modeled as a galactic wind based on @xcite .",
    "we adopt a constant wind velocity of @xmath12 , a mass - loss rate that is twice of the star formation rate , and an energy efficiency of unity such that the wind carries @xmath13 of the supernova energy .",
    "the wind direction is anisotropical , preferentially perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "this wind model causes an outflow of gas , transporting energy , matter and metals out of the galactic disk in proportion to the star formation rate .",
    "the model of black hole growth and feedback follows that of @xcite and @xcite , where black holes are represented by collisionless `` sink '' particles that interact gravitationally with other components and accrete gas from their surroundings .",
    "the accretion rate is estimated from the local gas density and sound speed using a spherical bondi - hoyle @xcite model that is limited by the eddington rate .",
    "feedback from black hole accretion is modeled as thermal energy , @xmath14 of the radiation , injected into surrounding gas isotropically .",
    "this feedback scheme self - regulates the growth of the black hole and has been demonstrated to successfully reproduce many observed properties of local elliptical galaxies ( e.g , , @xcite ) and the most distant quasars at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "mergers of black holes can happen once two black holes are close enough and their relative speed is less than the local sound speed . in the simulation",
    ", the black hole seeding scheme follows that of previous work @xcite : a seed black hole of mass @xmath16 is planted in the gravitational potential minimum of each new halo identified by the friends - of - friends ( fof ) group finding algorithm with a total mass greater than @xmath17 .",
    "the computation was performed using the parallel , n - body / sph code gadget-3 , which is an improved version of that described in @xcite . for the computation of gravitational forces , the code uses the `` treepm '' method @xcite that combines a `` tree '' algorithm @xcite for short - range forces and a fourier transform particle - mesh method @xcite for long - range forces .",
    "gadget implements the entropy - conserving formulation of sph @xcite with adaptive particle smoothing , as in @xcite .",
    "radiative cooling and heating processes are calculated assuming collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite , and the uv background model of @xcite is used , which describes a spatial uniform uv background leading to reionization roughly at @xmath18 in the simulation .",
    "the whole simulation falls in a periodic box of @xmath19 on each side with a zoom - in region of a size @xmath20 .",

    "each snapshot is processed by an on - flying fof algorithm which tests the dark matter linking length as if they are less than 20% of their mean spacing .",
    "gas and star particles are then linked to the nearest dark matter particle .",
    "a substructure detection algorithm subfind ( an extended version of @xcite for gas and star particle ) is then applied to each group by calculating the local density and searching for locally overdense region .",
    "such an overdense region will be marked as a substructure of the parent group . throughout this work",

    "the bh mass is computed directly in the simulation , and we calculate the projected half - mass effective radius @xmath34 , and the line - of - sight mass - wieghted stellar velocity dispersion @xmath35 within @xmath34 . this projection procedure is performed for over 100 random line - of - sights .    the resulting @xmath0 relation is shown in figure  [ fig : msigma ] at six representative redshifts , in comparison with the observed @xmath0 relation of the nearby galaxies by @xcite .",
    "we fit our data at each redshift with the same power - law formula as that in @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the slope and the normalization of the relation , respectively .",

    "[ fig : msigma ] , there is a clear trend of evolution of the @xmath0 relation in both normalization and slope .",
    "the modeled galaxies systematically lie below the local @xmath0 relation at high redshift .",
    "a correlation emerges quickly after the bhs are formed , as high as @xmath41 , which is also the fast growth phase of bhs .",
    "as the galaxies evolve to low redshift , they converge to the observed local relation quickly . by @xmath31",
    ", some dwarfs eventually reach the line defined by local massive ellipticals , but the overall slope is noticeable steeper .",
    "the steeper slope at the low - mass end was also seen in simulations of @xcite , and in low - mass agn observations of @xcite from precise bh mass measurements using megamaser ( note , however , @xcite reported a shallower slope with a large sample of agns . ) .",

    "the scattering in both slope and normalization becomes larger at higher redshift , due to smaller galaxy number and increasing difficulty in the measurement of @xmath35 .",
    "nevertheless , both slope and normalization show strong evolution with redshift out to @xmath42 , as illustrated by the fitting lines : @xmath43    the evolution of the normalization of the @xmath0 relation from our simulation is consistent with the result of @xcite from cosmological simulations , which also showed @xmath44 , and that of @xcite from merger simulations , @xmath45 by fixing the slope to 4.0 , but shallower than that given by @xcite , @xmath46 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite suggested that the expected velocity dispersion for a given stellar mass is larger at higher redshift .",
    "as for the evolution of the slope , @xcite did not see a monotonic trend possibly due to the limited number of redshifts in that study .",
    "instead they put an upper limit on the absolute value of the evolution of slope , @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite showed that the slope becomes steeper with decreasing redshift , similar to the trend we find , except that they have a much larger slope at @xmath48 since the massive bhs ( @xmath49 ) fall above the local correlation .",
    "the steep `` tilt '' at @xmath48 in their work may be caused by the rapid growth of these massive bhs which gained their masses rapidly through mild super - eddington accretion rates during this period .",
    "in fact , a similar trend is also present in figure  [ fig : msigma - ev ] at @xmath50 when the most massive black holes in our simulation assembled most of their masses .    in observation ,",
    "the @xmath0 relation has been studied by using the width of some emission lines such as oiii or h@xmath51 as a proxy for stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that this scaling relation either does not evolve ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or does so weakly , with bhs more massive than inferred from the local relation by a factor of a few at @xmath52 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in figure",

    "@xmath62    the modest evolution in the @xmath1 relation from our simulation agrees well with the result from @xcite in the same mass range .",
    "it appears that the bhs in massive galaxies ( @xmath63 grow more quickly than the stellar mass @xcite .",

    "however , most of the studies derived the bulge stellar mass from the luminosity of the spheroid . while this can be done robustly for local ellipticals , the uncertainty becomes larger at higher redshift , because the stellar populations in bulges are not well understood at @xmath66 , it is more difficult to distinguish between the host and the bulge component , and bulge may not have formed in some high redshift galaxies or agns .",
    "in fact , when considering the total luminosity or the stellar mass of the host galaxy , it was found that the @xmath1 has a much weaker evolution , if any , than the @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , consistent with our finding in figure  [ fig : mstar - ev ] .",
    "studies of quasar host galaxies indicate that @xmath1 relation may be present as early as @xmath67 @xcite , and that evidence for evolution of this relation is not conclusive because of the following three reasons : ( 1 ) bh mass calibration has a factor of 2 systematic uncertainty ; ( 2 ) bulge mass is not directly measured ; and ( 3 ) selection bias .",
    "@xcite studied 96 quasars and their host galaxies and found an evolution in @xmath68 from @xmath69 to the present day .",
    "however , the possibility that these host galaxies may be biased towards lower mass galaxies at high redshift is present , as pointed out by@xcite .",

    "this means that the galaxies at high redshift in our simulation have not yet reached virial equilibrium .",
    "this result suggests that the @xmath0 correlation may be a result of virial equilibrium of the galaxies .",
    "qualitatively , from the criterion for virial equilibrium as suggested by @xcite :    @xmath97    which gives a relation between the galaxy mass and the stellar velocity dispersion and effective radius :    @xmath98    since the luminosity of a galaxy , l ( @xmath99 ) , is proportional to the stellar surface brightness and the projected surface area : @xmath100    assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath91 and a constant surface brightness @xmath101 , the above two relations lead to @xmath102    from our results in the previous section , the self - regulated growth of stars and bhs in galaxies gives @xmath103 , therefore ,",
    "@xmath104    this virial equilibrim - origin model can explain the discrepancy between observations and our simulation .",
    "in the observations , most of the galaxies , in particular massive ones and those with bulges , may have reached relaxation and virial equilibrium quickly , because the more massive a galaxy is , the shorter relaxation timescale it has @xcite .",
    "it is believed that merger can trigger a rapid growth of bhs and the build up of ellipticals and bulge component @xcite , when large amount of shocked gas by gravitational interaction fuels bhs accretion and intense star formation @xcite .",
    "this scenario is also supported by observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spheroids formed through violent merger quickly relax and reach virial equilibrium . as a result",
    ", they satisfy the @xmath0 relation and show little or no evolution . on the other hand , low - mass systems take a longer time to reach virial equilibrium ,",
    "thus they may show some evolution in the @xmath0 .",
    "in order to achieve desired resolutions to resolve low - mass bh systems in cosmological simulations , we focus on a milky way - size halo in this paper .",
    "however , this has led to a serious limitation : the galaxy sample is very small .",
    "the large scattering due to the small number statistics in our results , in particular at high redshift , may have affected the actual evolution of the scaling relations we studied .",
    "in such a zoom - in simulation , there might be contamination by heavier low - resolution particles outside of the high - resolution zoom - in region @xcite .",
    "this could be more severe as we approach to the boundary of the zoom - in region . however , most of our galaxies are located well within the boundary .",
    "we checked the presence of low - resolution particles in all the subhalos which host bhs , and found that the mass fraction is very small , about @xmath105 .",
    "we conclude that the contamination is not significant in our galaxy sample .",
    "the seeds of galactic bhs is an outstanding problem .",
    "it is unknown where the seed of the milky way came from . in our simulation , we follow the previous studies @xcite and create seeds of @xmath106 in halos with mass above @xmath107 .",
    "although it is not our focus to reproduce exactly the same bh as in the milky way , our seeding scheme produced a @xmath108 bh in the main halo , much more massive than the current estimate of @xmath109 in the milky way .    a wide range of seed masses , from @xmath110 to @xmath111 ,",
    "has been proposed @xcite . for examples , a small seed of @xmath112 by the collapsed remnants from the first stars @xcite , or a massive one of @xmath113 by the catastrophic collapse of a supermassive star , or gas clump @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the effects of bh seeds on the bh scaling relations using semi - analytical merger trees .",
    "they investigated two seeding models , light seeds of @xmath114 from popiii stars , and heavy seeds from direct gas collapse ( which has a distribution function with a peak of @xmath106 ) , and suggested that the @xmath0 relation is a result of seeding mechanism and growth prescription , and that massive seeds produce better agreement with observations at @xmath31 .",
    "they also predicted a large population of low - mass bhs at high redshifts , which has not been detected .",
    "we plan to improve the current study in future work by increasing the statistics",
    ". we will perform uniform cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in larger boxes in order to obtain a large number of galaxies at different redshift .",
    "we also plan to investigate different bh seeding schemes and the resulting bh  host galaxy relations .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0 and relations @xmath1 relations in low - mass systems ( @xmath2 ) using the aquila simulation , a high - resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation focused on a milky way - size galaxy .",
    "the simulation included dark matter , gas dynamics , star formation , black hole growth , and feedback from both sne and accreting bhs .",
    "here is a list of our findings :    * the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations evolve differently with redshift : the former shows a remarkable evolution in both slope and normalization , while the latter shows little evolution in the redshift range @xmath115 .",
    "* there is a close link between the @xmath0 relation and the dynamical state of the system  the galaxies that fall on the observed correlation have a virial ratio @xmath116 close to 1 , indicating that they are in virial equilibrium , while those that off the relation instead have a ratio larger than 1 . *",
    "the star formation and black hole growth in galaxies are self - regulated  the ratio between black hole accretion rate and star formation rate remains nearly constant over @xmath3 , probably owing to feedback and gas availability in the galaxies .",
    "these results suggest that observed scaling correlations have different origins : the @xmath0 relation may be the result of virial equilibrium , while the @xmath1 relation may the result of self - regulated star formation and black hole growth in galaxies .",
