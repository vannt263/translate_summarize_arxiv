    "since the seminal works of zeleny @xcite and taylor @xcite on electrified jets and drops , of pellat @xcite on dielectric liquid rise between vertically oriented parallel electrodes , or of lippmann @xcite on electrowetting , the control of fluid interfaces deformation under an applied field has received an increasing attention for the past century .",
    "such a control technique plays a significant role in emerging micro / nano technologies with applications as different as electrospraying @xcite , ink - jet printing @xcite , electrospinning of polymer fibres @xcite , surface relief patterning @xcite , tuneable lensing @xcite , or microfluidics @xcite .",
    "when acting on finite volume objects such as drops , the electric stress tends to elongate the fluid interface in the direction of the electric field , as described by the well - established electrohydrostatic theory @xcite .",
    "this approach is usually relevant to the extreme situations where either both fluids , inside and outside the drop , are insulating dielectrics with no free charges present at their interface or the drop is a conducting fluid while the surrounding one is insulating . for a drop with zero net electric charge placed in a uniform external electric field ,",
    "the electrohydrostatic theory predicts that the drop surface is always deformed into a prolate spheroid .",
    "drop deformation toward an oblate spheroid was nevertheless observed in experiments @xcite . to explain qualitatively this different types of shape , taylor proposed a theory based on the leaky dielectric model @xcite , which was the basis for further developments leading to the so - called electrohydrodynamics @xcite",
    ". a recent investigation of electric deformations on fluid interfaces @xcite showed that prolate and oblate shapes in the field direction can be obtained for both drops and bubbles depending on conductivity and dielectric constant ratios . a magnetic field can as well interact with fluid interfaces and form well - organized peak structures @xcite , or elongate magnetic droplets @xcite .",
    "the quantitative description of these deformations also opened new horizons in fluid metrology by giving the opportunity to characterize , in a noncontact way , the mechanical properties of fluid interfaces , with a particular attention to the interfacial tension using an electric @xcite or magnetic @xcite field .",
    "a new application domain of these electric and magnetic manifestations is digital microfluidics , i.e. the manipulation of two - phase flows and droplets in microchannels @xcite as for instance , electric actuation @xcite to manipulate flowing droplets .",
    "however , in some particular cases , the use of electrodes or coils may become difficult , particularly for in situ characterization in open environments like oceans @xcite or for single microobjects such as cells @xcite . to overcome",
    "this difficulty , a second interface deformation approach due to radiation pressure effects , has been anticipated .",
    "for instance , it is now well established that acoustic radiation pressure can deform a fluid interface @xcite and even induce droplet ejection for drop - on - demand devices @xcite .",
    "recently , with the emergence of nanobiotechnologies , this strategy has been successfully extended to micrometer and sub - micrometer scales using optical waves .",
    "for example , the optical deformation of soft materials in general , and of biological micro - objects in particular , brought new insights on the viscoelastic properties and the elasticity of red blood cells @xcite .",
    "the optical radiation pressure of a laser beam focused on a fluid interface is also known as an efficient contactless tool for fast metrological measurements of interfacial tension @xcite and viscosity @xcite at a microscopic scale , which is particularly appealing in the difficult cases of weak interfacial tensions and large viscosities .",
    "thus , performing a detailed investigation of the deformation of drops by the optical radiation pressure in both the linear and nonlinear regimes of deformation , would combine the possibility of extending the fundamental and applied developments of finite volume electrohydrodynamics to the optical domain with the advantage of bringing quantitative insights on nonlinear deformation of finite size domains by laser waves , a domain which is still poorly known .",
    "this is the purpose of the present work .",
    "+ the optical deformation of liquid interfaces was first observed by ashkin & dziedzic @xcite using a focused laser beam to deform the water / air free surface .",
    "they experimentally demonstrated that the meniscus always bends toward the medium of lower optical index whatever the direction of propagation of the incident wave .",
    "later on , zhang & chang @xcite observed the deformation of a water droplet illuminated by a linearly polarized pulsed laser considering two different energies ( 100 @xmath2 and 200 @xmath2 ) . in these experiments ,",
    "the optical absorption was assumed to be small enough to discard thermal effects . at the lower energy ,",
    "zhang & chang observed an oscillation of the drop surface due to the propagation of capillary waves , a phenomenon that was further confirmed by lai et al .",
    "@xcite and by brevik & kluge @xcite . in both studies",
    ", authors solved the problem numerically using a linear wave theory which assumes a linearization of both the flow and optical radiation pressure .",
    "when the water droplet was illuminated with the highest available energy ( 200 @xmath2 ) , its front face adopted a sort of conical shape leading eventually to its disruption and the generation of micro - droplets at the tip . in order to avoid such a large amount of laser energy and access to stationary shapes instead of transient ones due to a pulsed excitation",
    ", new investigations were performed more recently by casner _",
    "_ @xcite and wunenburger _",
    "_ @xcite using the interface between two liquid phases in coexistence close to their critical point .",
    "the interfacial tension between such phases being extremely small ( @xmath3  n.m@xmath4 ) compared to the water superficial tension ( @xmath5  mn.m@xmath4 ) , deformations of many orders of magnitude larger than in previous experiment @xcite could be easily observed using a continuous laser wave .",
    "they experimentally confirmed that an interface always bends toward the fluid of lower refractive index whatever the direction of propagation of the beam . at large beam powers , typically of the order of @xmath6 , interface deformations become nonlinear .",
    "stable nipple - like shapes were observed when the laser wave is incident from the fluid of lowest optical index while propagation in the opposite direction leads to a needle - like shape , the disruption of the interface and a jetting instability driven by the total reflection of light within the deformation . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig photo cones ] , interface disruption is still observed in such near - critical two - phase samples during ( i ) the deformation and the subsequent draining of a thin film ( of largest refractive index ) which wets the cell edges near the critical point and ( ii ) the adiabatic growth of a heterogeneous liquid drop ( of largest refractive index too ) during a liquid - liquid phase transition driven by a localized composition quench induced by a laser @xcite . while very different in nature , these last manifestations show analogies , at least at the level of experimental pictures , with the deformation and disruption of charged drops observed by zeleny @xcite and taylor @xcite under strong electrical fields .",
    "indeed , by increasing the electric field , drops deformation evolves from rounded to conical shapes emitting eventually a jet of micro - droplets at the tip .",
    "a theoretical study was proposed by taylor @xcite indicating that the stable static solution for a conductive drop submitted to both electric and capillary couplings is near - conical with a semi - angle of @xmath7 . since then",
    ", many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works have been performed , to analyse stability and disruption of these conical shapes as well as on the value of the semi - angle versus electric properties of the liquids ( see for instance fig.2 in stone et al .",
    "@xcite for the dielectric case and the review of fernandez de la mora @xcite for conducting droplets ) .",
    "note finally , that deformed interfaces with conical shape can be found in the absence of electromagnetic excitation .",
    "a first example is the near - conical shapes observed during the deformation of the interface between immiscible fluids by selective withdrawal , with a straw whose tip is suspended above the unperturbed interface @xcite .",
    "other fluid dynamics examples are drop breakup from a nozzle @xcite or sink flows in the presence of an interface @xcite , thus illustrating the emergence of a sort of robust and general topological transition @xcite of fluid interface deformations under localized forcing . motivated by some amazing effects of the radiation pressure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig photo cones ] and suspecting that finite size effects may promote the observed near - conical shapes , we propose a numerical investigation of optical deformation of sessile liquid drops by continuous laser waves . indeed , beyond the simple deformation of spherical interfaces , we demonstrate in the present work that optical stretching can lead to near - conical shapes . above a radiation pressure threshold , drop disruption is also observed numerically , in the absence of total reflection of light however , demonstrating a new phenomenon of interface instability .",
    "the optical analogue of oblate deformation by an electric field , induced here by an optical squeezing , is investigated as well . at large radiation pressures ,",
    "the local squeezing leads to the formation of torus - like shapes .",
    "section ii is devoted to the physical model used to predict the deformation of drops by the optical radiation pressure .",
    "section iii briefly summarizes the numerical algorithm used here , based on the boundary integral element method ( biem ) .",
    "results on drop deformations for both stretching and squeezing are presented and discussed in section iv .     laser beam .",
    "the initially flat interface ( not shown ) takes a rounded shape which further becomes near - conical and eventually destabilizes to give birth to a jet .",

    "we assume that the three - phase contact line is motionless .",

    ", @xmath33 is the interfacial tension between fluids 1 and 2 , @xmath34 is the dynamic viscosity of fluid i and @xmath35 is the average viscosity of the fluids .",
    "it could be pointed out that , depending on the fluids and/or the large beam powers under consideration , ( those given in fig .",
    "1 , for instance ) , temperature effects may disturb or even overcome the mechanical effect of light on fluid interfaces , thus making a coupled heat and momentum transfer description necessary .",
    "the first expected additional effect is a direct laser heating due to the optical absorption of the drop and/or of the surrounding fluid .",
    "fluids must indeed be transparent at the used optical wavelength as it is generally the case for classical liquids in the visible window .",
    "typically , the optical absorption of water , used in ashkin & dziedzic and zhang & chang experiments @xcite , is of the order of @xmath36 in the visible region , while that of the micellar phases used in the examples illustrated in fig .",
    "1 is @xmath37 . in the latter ,",
    "the overheating induced by a beam power of the order of 1 w is smaller than 0.1 k @xcite .",
    "direct laser heating effects can then be discarded , even in critical fluids as far as temperature is not too close to the critical one .",
    "thus , we consider in the following all liquid properties ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) as constant in the presence of laser light , @xmath38 and @xmath39 being respectively the density and optical refraction index of fluid i. a second coupling is the thermocapillary effect . since the interfacial tension @xmath33 is a function of the temperature , local laser heating may drive interfacial tension gradients inducing stresses on the drop interface and its subsequent deformation @xcite .",
    "a typical value of @xmath40 for classical fluids is @xmath41 @xcite , which leads to negligible thermocapillary effects considering the above mentioned laser overheating . for the case illustrated in fig . 1",
    ", we already found that thermocapillary interface deformation is negligible near the critical point @xcite .",
    "consequently , we can safely discard temperature effects without affecting the generality of our purpose . finally , when getting very close to the critical point , the capillary length @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the density contrast and @xmath44 the acceleration due to gravity , vanishes while thermal fluctuations increase .",
    "then , the interface roughness @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 is the thermal energy , increases too and may dominate capillary effects . using the critical data given in reference @xcite for deformations presented in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath47 requires @xmath48 , a condition which has always been fulfilled in experiments .",
    "conversely , for classical fluids , @xmath33 lies between @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath43 is about @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "as a consequence , @xmath53 is orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath54 so that thermal fluctuations are also negligible for this class of fluids .    in addition , we assume in this study that inertial and gravity effects are negligible at the micrometric scale , which implies that the reynolds and bond number are small compared to unity . along with the condition @xmath47 which is also automatically satisfied",
    "as indicated above , we consider an incompressible quasi - static stokes flow in each phase .",
    "therefore , the hydrodynamics of each liquid phase is described by the stokes and mass conservation equations , respectively given by : @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are respectively the dimensionless velocity and the pseudo - pressure in fluid @xmath59 .",
    "this pseudo - pressure contains the electrostrictive contribution of light in dielectrics @xcite which was demonstrated to have no incidence on the shape or the height of the deformed interface @xcite .",

    "considering the classical expression of the divergence free hydrodynamic stress tensor @xmath64 , @xmath65 we can write the boundary condition at the interface as follows : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the unit vector normal to the interface directed from fluid 1 to fluid 2 , and @xmath68 is the viscosity ratio",
    "( [ stressjump ] ) simply expresses the fact that the normal stress on the interface is balanced by capillary forces and the optical radiation pressure , respectively represented in dimensionless forms by @xmath69 and @xmath70 . indeed , in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ stressjump ] ) , @xmath69 represents the dimensionless double mean curvature of the interface , given by : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the local slope of the interface .",
    "the second term , @xmath70 , is the contribution of the dimensionless optical radiation pressure at the drop interface . as the interface deformation",
    "is experimentally found to be directed toward the fluid of smallest refractive index whatever the direction of propagation @xcite , we consider the minkowski point of view which states that the photon momentum in a dielectric medium varies linearly with the refractive index @xcite ; for a review on the abraham - minkowski controversy see for instance the review of brevik @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath70 is nevertheless affected by the direction of propagation through its dependence on the incidence and transmitted angles .",
    "in addition , @xmath70 also depends on the polarization of the laser wave . in the present work ,",
    "we preserve the axial symmetry of the laser / fluid interaction by assuming a circular polarization of the laser wave .",
    "finally , for the sake of simplicity , we assume refringence of light at the drop interface at any incidence angle . by doing this , we eliminate situations where total reflection of light may occur at the interface as those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig photo cones ] for example .",
    "therefore , the laser wave is supposed to propagate from the optically less dense fluid .",
    "note that this choice is not restrictive at all ; by removing this assumption , we would find the same type of drop deformations but with an asymmetry in amplitude due to the nonlinear behavior of the transmission and reflection fresnel coefficients with the angle of incidence @xcite .",
    "another reason for this choice is made clear in sec .",

    "the expression of the rescaled optical radiation pressure becomes @xmath78 where @xmath79 is given by : @xmath80 in eqs ( [ raddown]-[radup ] ) , we have respectively denoted by @xmath81 and @xmath82 the incidence and transmission angles ; @xmath83 is the light celerity in vacuum .",

    "moreover , @xmath88 represents the intensity of the gaussian laser beam . by neglecting the weak z - dependence of the beam radius ,",
    "its expression is given by : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the beam power .",
    "in addition , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the fresnel transmission coefficients of energy fluxes .",
    "these coefficients are obtained from the ratio of the transmitted to incident normal components of poynting s vectors and are expressed as @xmath93 for a circulary polarized beam . in order to quantify effects of the laser wave on the interface deformation , it is convenient to define the electromagnetic to laplace pressure ratio .",
    "this ratio @xmath94 , taken at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 , is defined as : @xmath97 where @xmath39 refers to the optical index of the incidence fluid .",
    "when no slip is assumed at the interface , along with the fact that fluids are immiscible , it follows that the velocity @xmath98 , of the interface @xmath17 is equal to that of each fluid particle on @xmath17 , i.e. : @xmath99 moreover , the movement of the interface is described using a lagrangian approach .",
    "it consists in following each fluid particle of the interface in its lagrangian motion according to the kinematic condition : @xmath100this condition indicates that the interface is advected along with the flow until the equilibrium is reached for which normal velocities along the interface are zero ,",

    "finally , we assume a classical no - slip boundary condition on all the solid boundaries of the domain @xmath103the above system of equations is solved using a boundary integral element method ( biem ) .",
    "due to the axial symmetry of the laser / drop interaction , it consists in an axisymmetric integral formulation making use of the fundamental solution of stokes equations .",
    "the solution is sought with a constant boundary elements discretization technique according to the numerical scheme described below .",
    "a brief description of the numerical algorithm is presented in this section . for more extensive details on",
    "the biem applied to a two - phase axisymmetric flow , the reader may refer to the review by tanzosh et al . on the solution of free surface flow problems using this technique @xcite .",
    "the biem reveals to be an excellent tool to solve interfacial flow problems with high resolution as reported in the analysis of flow involving electric and magnetic fields @xcite or buoyancy @xcite @xcite.because solutions to stokes equation can be formulated in terms of green s functions , we can rewrite the governing equations as a system of integral equations over the boundaries of the computational domain . when doing so , the boundary integral form of the stokes equation for fluid @xmath59 ( @xmath104 ) can be written as follows @xcite@xmath105@xmath106 being the unit normal vector directed toward the outside of fluid domain @xmath59 . in this last expression ,",

    "in this section , we first present results on drop stretching by the optical radiation pressure .",
    "an outward deformation of the liquid drop is obtained when its optical index of refraction is larger than that of the surrounding fluid ( i.e. @xmath73 ) , resulting in the formation of near - conical shapes at different dimensionless initial drop radii @xmath19 and refractive index ratios , characteristic of most dielectric fluids .",
    "an instability arising from the destabilization of the drop above a threshold value of @xmath137 is also demonstrated .",

    "[ cone.5 ] , one clearly see that the shape of the drop progressively varies from rounded ( @xmath137=10 , 20 , 40 ) to near - conical ( @xmath137=500 ) .",
    "these stationary shapes result from the competition between capillary forces and optical radiation effects .",
    "increasing @xmath137 increases the height of the deformation and thus induces in turn an increase of the curvature of the interface .",
    "this effect is maximized at the tip of the deformation due to the gaussian profile of the light intensity and the normal incidence at the interface at @xmath95 , as illustrated in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ cone.5 ] .",
    "therefore , an important increase in @xmath137 eventually leads to pointed drop shapes , assuming the fixed contact line hypothesis and the finiteness of the drop volume .",
    "although the stress on the interface is here of optical origin rather than electrically or magnetically induced , the deformation of drops by the optical radiation pressure shows striking similarities with those observed in electro- and magneto - hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "there are nevertheless two major differences .",
    "first , the relative extension of the exciting field versus the drop size , considered as infinite in the case of electric or magnetic fields , is intrinsically finite due to the gaussian shape of the laser intensity in the current analysis .",
    "moreover , the associated radiation pressure nonlinearly decreases with the incident angle through the fresnel transmission coefficient , drastically reducing the mechanical effect of the beam at the edge of the deformation when its aspect ratio increases significantly ( see the right inset of fig .",
    "[ cone.5 ] ) .",
    "second , the pointed shape observed on the axis does not originate from a local increase of the electric field at the tip as in the electrostatic case because at a given @xmath137 , the optical radiation pressure at the tip , where the incidence angle is close to zero , remains regular .",

    "the main difference with the present investigation is that now , the volume of one of the two fluids , the drop , becomes significantly small compared to the other one . increasing @xmath137 still increases the height of the deformation , but the drop turns to adopt a near - conical steady shape , the semi - angle being surprisingly preserved along a wide plateau which extension increases towards smaller values of @xmath183 while increasing @xmath137 ( see fig .",
