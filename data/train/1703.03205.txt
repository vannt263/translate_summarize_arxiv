    "the effect of phonon disorder is included in the framework of the multicomponent cpa ( see below ) .",

    "we use a simple estimate of magnetic moment based on the following assumptions : ( i ) the magnetic state above the curie temperature can be represented by the dlm state , ( ii ) the average interatomic exchange field is zero , i.e. , the interatomic interactions can be neglected , and ( iii ) the energy per atom with magnetic moment @xmath33 is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . here",

    "it may be demonstrated on the comparison with the molecular dynamics @xcite that gives @xmath79 bohr for 5500 k , whereas the extrapolation of the debye theory not taking into account the high pressure leads to @xmath80 bohr .",
    "as already mentioned , the kubo - greenwood formula was used to calculate the electrical conductivity .",
    "the influence of the fermi - dirac distribution function at finite temperature appearing in this formula was examined and compared to electrical conductivity , which was obtained if only phonons were included but the temperature - induced broadening of the fermi - dirac distribution neglected .",
    "the relative change of the conductivity does not exceed a few percent even at 6000  k ( @xmath81 bohr ) .",
    "at this temperature , the change is about 1.3  % for the nonmagnetic state and 2.7  % for the dlm one .      finally , it is interesting to note that results similar to the multicomponent cpa are obtained using a phenomenological model in which the effect of phonons is simulated by a finite imaginary part i m  @xmath82 added to the fermi energy of corresponding green functions in the the kubo - greenwood approach ( the spin - independent finite relaxation - time model ) .",
    "specifically , we have tested i m  @xmath82=5.10@xmath83  ry which gave resistivity of non - magnetic bcc fe due to phonons about 54  @xmath0 cm and which corresponds to @xmath13 about 0.35 bohr . assuming the same i m  @xmath82 we obtained the total resistivities ( including the effect of spin disorder ) of 63 and 69  @xmath0 cm for bcc fe and bcc fe@xmath24si@xmath25 alloy .",
    "corresponding calculated values for @xmath27 bohr were 63 and 72  @xmath0 cm , respectively , in a good agreement with the above multicomponent cpa results ."

    "<S> the estimated value of the sdr is about 20  @xmath0 cm for bcc fe . </S>",
    "<S> very rough estimates of other contributions , namely , @xmath2 from phonons and @xmath10 from electron correlations are @xmath28 cm and @xmath29 cm . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from alloy disorder @xmath30 depends on the type and concentration of impurities , for bcc fe@xmath24si@xmath25 alloy we found @xmath31 cm . </S>",

    "<S> this fact demonstrates a strong violation of the matthiessen rule at the earth s core conditions . </S>",
