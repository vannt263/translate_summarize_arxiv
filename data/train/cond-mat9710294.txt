    "native defects at and near surfaces are commonly invoked in explaining various electrical and structural properties of surfaces and interfaces such as fermi - level pinning at clean and metal covered surfaces .",
    "@xcite also properties such as the surface chemical reactivity , nucleation processes , or diffusion at surfaces and interfaces  @xcite depend to a large extent on the presence and properties of native defects .",
    "motivation for the study of surface defects also arises from the investigation of bulk impurities : cleaving crystals in ultrahigh vacuum offers the opportunity to study defects at and near the cleavage plane .",
    "previous investigations on dopant atoms ,  @xcite antisites ,  @xcite and defect complexes  @xcite have shown that the concentration of such impurities corresponds well to the measured bulk concentrations . however , it is by no means obvious how the structural and optical properties of the defects are changed if they are close to or within the surface .",
    "we therefore compare theoretically the properties of defects at and below surfaces with their corresponding bulk defects in order to interpret the experimental data measured on cleavage planes .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze how the properties and behavior of native defects change with their distance from the surface . in particular , we focus on vacancies since these defects have been experimentally studied in bulk systems  @xcite as well as at the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "@xcite the atomic as well as the electronic structure of cation and anion vacancies in different surface layers and in a bulk environment are discussed .",
    "we also present results concerning the formation energies of the different vacancies as well as theoretical stm pictures that can be directly compared to experiment .",
    "we will show that subsurface vacancies are significantly different from surface or bulk vacancies : vacancies in the second surface layer are unstable against the formation of antisite vacancy pairs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we briefly describe our method . in sec.[section3 ] we present the atomic and electronic structure for gallium and phosphorus surface vacancies . in sec.[section4 ] these results are compared with calculations of vacancies below the surface and in the bulk .",
    "we discuss further the formation energies and conclude on the abundance in thermal equilibrium in sec.[section6 ] . based on the calculated atomic and electronic structure ,",
    "stm images of the various surface and subsurface defects are simulated and will be discussed in sec.[section5 ] .",
    "finally we will summarize our results .",

    "the eigenfunctions of the kohn - sham operator are expanded in plane waves  @xcite using a cutoff energy of 8 ry .",
    "tests were performed for the electronic structure using a cutoff up to 15ry .",
    "they did not result in significant changes in the character of the wave functions or the formation energies of the defects .",
    "for the integration in reciprocal space one special * k*-point in the ( @xmath0 ) surface brillouin zone ( point - group @xmath1 ) is used .",
    "@xcite with this choice of basis set we find the theoretical lattice constant to be @xmath2 .",
    "this value is @xmath3% smaller than the experimental result ,  @xcite which is typical for a iii - v semiconductor calculated within the lda ( ref .  ) and neglecting zero - point vibrations .",
    "the calculations of the bulk defects are performed in a 64-atom cubic supercell .",
    "a 96-atom supercell with six layers of gap and a vacuum region corresponding to four layers is used for the simulation of defects on and below the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "the surface cell in these calculations has a @xmath4 geometry in the @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] directions and the defect is created on one side of the slab . for the calculation of defects , structure optimization is performed to the first two outermost layers for the surface defects , to the first three layers for defects in the second surface layer , and to nearest and second nearest neighbors for all other vacancies . in order to quantify the errors due to the finite thickness of our slab and surface unit cell , we calculated the gallium surface vacancy also in larger @xmath7 and @xmath8 surface cells as well as for up to eight layers in the @xmath4 cell .",
    "these tests resulted in a variation of defect formation energies less than 50mev ( table  [ tab01 ] ) while the character and eigenvalues of the defect states remained almost unchanged .",

    "first let us briefly recall the properties of the defect - free gap(110 ) surface , which has been extensively studied .",
    "@xcite the point - group @xmath1 of this surface consists of a single mirror plane in the @xmath6 $ ] direction and the relaxation of surface atoms is characterized by a pronounced outwards movement of the anion and an inward shift of the cation in the surface layer .",
    "the result is a characteristic buckling of the surface atoms , which is commonly described by a tilting angle @xmath12 .",
    "we find this angle to be @xmath13 and the height difference between gallium and phosphorus surface atoms to be @xmath14 , in good agreement with previous theoretical  @xcite and leed data .",
    "@xcite the relaxation is driven by the lowering of the filled surface state located at the surface anions . as a result of the surface relaxation ,",
    "the back bonds of the anions are nearly perpendicular while the cations show a planar bonding configuration indicating that these atoms are @xmath15 and @xmath16 bonded .",
    "the gain in surface energy due to relaxation is @xmath17  mev per surface unit cell .",
    "let us now consider a gallium vacancy @xmath10 at the surface : removing a cation from the surface layer results in creating dangling orbitals at the two neighboring phosphorus atoms @xmath18 at the surface and one at the neighboring atom @xmath19 in the second layer of the slab [ fig.[fig01](a ) ] .",
    "the phosphorus atoms @xmath18 in the first layer are twofold and the atom @xmath19 in the second layer is threefold coordinated .",

    "all other atoms remain close to the positions of the unperturbed surface with a maximum relaxation smaller than @xmath20 .",

    "we find two defect - related states in the fundamental band gap :  @xcite one that we call @xmath49 is located @xmath50ev above the valence band , the other called @xmath51 is close to the upper surface band .",
    "for the neutral charge state , @xmath49 is singly occupied and @xmath51 is empty . from analyzing the wave functions and the local density of states ( ldos ) , we find that both @xmath49 and @xmath51 consist mainly of @xmath15-states centered at the three @xmath52 neighbors . from this analysis",

    "the lowest - lying localized level is determined at about @xmath55ev and can be characterized as back bonds of the three nearest - neighbor atoms .    the symmetry and nature of these defect states",
    "can be qualitatively understood in terms of a simple model :  @xcite creating a vacancy results in three dangling orbitals at the two surface atoms @xmath18 and at the atom @xmath19 in the second layer .",
    "rehybridization of these orbitals will give rise to three nondegenerated defect states . according to the point symmetry of the ( 110 ) surface ,",
    "these defect states are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the mirror plane .",
    "this is different from the bulk system , where @xmath56 symmetry gives rise to @xmath57 and @xmath58 states formed by the dangling orbitals of four nearest - neighbor atoms .  @xcite analyzing the character of defect - related wave functions , we find the @xmath53 state to be symmetric while the singly occupied state @xmath49 is antisymmetric .",

    "these results contrast ours : without including structural optimization , we find two nearly degenerate levels above the valence - band maximum , but upon atomic relaxation the levels split and take the energies shown in fig.[fig02](a ) .    the electronic structure of surface defects can be investigated experimentally by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) . in stm",
    ", the charge states can be estimated by examining defects on @xmath15- and @xmath60-type doped crystals and comparing the local surface band bending caused by the charged defects with that of other charged impurities such as ionized dopants .",
    "@xcite in sts , a tunneling spectrum at the defect site gives directly the position of ionization energies in the band gap as has been done for antisite defects at the gaas ( 110 ) surface .",
    "@xcite from our results , a first estimate of ionization energies of the defect can be obtained by the positions of the defect levels in the neutral charge state .",
    "as the gallium surface vacancy has a singly occupied state at midgap , we expect at least three charge states . while we are not aware of sts measurements on surface vacancies , this result appears to be in contrast to stm measurements by ebert ,  @xcite where the gallium surface vacancy was found to be neutral for",
    "@xmath60- and @xmath15-type material .",
    "however , it is important to take into account that the charge state of a surface defect is not determined by the position of the bulk fermi level but by the position of the surface fermi energy . indeed , photoelectron spectroscopy experiments  @xcite on gap(110 )",
    "indicate that the fermi level at the surface is pinned near midgap , which might stabilize the neutral charge state .",
    "further theoretical and experimental studies are necessary to clarify this issue .",
    "the phosphorus surface vacancy , @xmath61 , is surrounded by three low - coordinated gallium atoms ; two in the first layer ( @xmath62 ) and one in the second layer ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the calculated equilibrium geometry of the defect is summarized in table[tab02 ] and fig.[fig01](b ) . as for the gallium vacancy ,",
    "the equilibrium structure maintains the @xmath1 symmetry of the defect - free surface and atomic relaxations are mainly restricted to nearest - neighbor atoms .",
    "second nearest neighbors relax less than @xmath20 .",
    "however , the inward relaxation of the surface atoms @xmath62 is clearly less pronounced than for the gallium vacancy .",
    "the origin of this is the different configuration of surface cations and anions on the defect - free surface : since surface gallium atoms at the relaxed but unperturbed surface are located deeper in the surface than phosphorus atoms , the initial volume spanned by the nearest - neighbor atoms is much smaller for @xmath61 than for @xmath64 . as a consequence , the relaxation results in an _ increase _ of the surface buckling near the defect ( @xmath65 as compared to @xmath14 ) and not in a decrease as for @xmath10 .",
    "the distances between the atoms surrounding the defect are @xmath66 for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 separation .",
    "this compares to @xmath46 in bulk gap and @xmath70 in bulk gallium .",
    "@xcite the angle between the back bonds of the surface gallium atoms @xmath62 is @xmath71 as compared to @xmath72 for the relaxed unperturbed surface .",
    "thus , like the cations at the surface without a vacancy , the atoms @xmath62 prefer an @xmath16 bonding configuration .",
    "while this is the first _ ab initio _ calculation of anion surface vacancies at gap ( 110 ) , there have been several publications for anion vacancies at the ( 110 ) surface of gaas : calculating @xmath73 in a @xmath74 surface cell , yi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite determined the height difference between surface gallium atoms for the neutral vacancy to be @xmath75 and for the negatively charged defect to be @xmath76 .",
    "zhang and zunger  @xcite calculated the inward relaxation of the atom @xmath62 towards @xmath73 to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the negative and positive charge state .",
    "the positively charged vacancy at gaas ( 110 ) has also been calculated by kim and chelikowsky ,  @xcite who give an inward relaxation of @xmath79 .",
    "keeping in mind that gap has a slightly smaller lattice constant than gaas , these values are in close agreement with our result of @xmath80 .",
    "the analysis of the electronic structure reveals also similarities between cation and anion surface vacancies .",
    "again , we find two defect levels in the fundamental band gap [ fig.[fig02](d ) ] .",
    "the level @xmath49 is located 0.8ev above the valence - band maximum and the level @xmath51 mixes with the unoccupied surface bands close to the conduction - band minimum .",
    "the occupation numbers are again one and zero for these defect states . in the valence band",
    "we find two localized states at about @xmath81ev and @xmath82ev .",
    "since these are resonances in the valence band , they are not shown in fig.[fig02](d ) .",
    "the levels @xmath49 and @xmath51 consist mainly of @xmath15-states centered at the gallium neighbors , while the lower - lying resonance is mostly @xmath83-like in character . as for @xmath10 ,",
    "the energetically lowest level is symmetric with respect to the surface mirror plane , @xmath49 is antisymmetric , and @xmath51 is symmetric .",
    "the electronic structure of the anion surface vacancy has been previously calculated by daw and smith  @xcite using a tight - binding method combined with greens - function techniques . without considering atomic relaxations ,",
    "they found the same sequence of electronic states for gaas ,  @xcite namely a symmetric level near the valence - band maximum and two levels in the band gap , where the lower , antisymmetric level is below midgap and the symmetric level is near the bottom of the conduction band . in the calculations for gap ,  @xcite the authors determined the position of the highest occupied level to be at @xmath84ev , which is in good agreement with our value of @xmath59ev for the _ unrelaxed _ surface vacancy .",
    "in contrast to these results , tight - binding calculations by allen , sankey , and dow  @xcite predicted three deep levels at @xmath59 , @xmath85 , and @xmath47ev .    comparing our results with recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for gaas ( 110 ) , we find qualitative agreement for the position and character of levels : kim and chelikowsky  @xcite obtained for the positively charged vacancy the same symmetry of the vacancy states and very similar positions of levels to those we find for the neutral vacancy at gap ( 110 ) .",

    "@xcite determined the half - filled level above the center of the band gap while zhang and zunger  @xcite calculated this level to be @xmath86 and @xmath50ev above the valence - band maximum for the positive and negative charge state .",

    "we conclude that the equilibrium structure of subsurface vacancies is mainly determined by the coordination of the nearest - neighbor atoms : twofold - coordinated atoms in the surface layer can alter their position significantly without breaking the remaining bonds .",
    "however , threefold - coordinated atoms as completely surrounding a vacancy in the third or a deeper layer are strongly bound to their positions in the unperturbed lattice .",
    "thus the ability of atoms in the second layer to relax is comparable to that of bulk atoms .",
    "consequently , vacancies with only threefold neighbors ( i.e. , vacancies below the second layer ) show very similar properties to bulk defects , while vacancies that have twofold - coordinated neighbors ( i.e. , vacancies at the surface and in the second layer ) show a very different geometry and electronic structure .",

    "we will now discuss how the energy required to create a vacancy in thermodynamic equilibrium ( i.e. , the formation energy ) is affected by the surface .",
    "the formation energy of a defect is given by    @xmath105    @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the number of cations and anions with chemical potentials @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the number of excess electrons in exchange with the electron reservoir @xmath111 . since we are focusing on neutral defects ( @xmath112 ) , the formation energies are independent of the fermi level .",
    "the ga and p chemical potentials are related to each other by the condition of chemical equilibrium with the bulk gap crystal :    @xmath113    the formation energy thus can be written as  @xcite    @xmath114    moreover , we can approximate the upper limit of the chemical potential of each species by their corresponding bulk phases ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "with the definition of the heat of formation of the crystal ,    @xmath116    we get a range in which the chemical potential can be varied from gallium - rich to phosphorus - rich conditions :    @xmath117    assuming metallic orthorhombic gallium  @xcite and black phosphorus in an orthorhombic unit cell  @xcite to be the equilibrium structures of the condensed elemental phases , we get @xmath118ev .",

    "according to eq .",
    "( [ e_bild ] ) , the following discussion remains unaffected by considering a different chemical environment .",
    "let us first discuss the case without any atomic relaxation : the most striking feature is the fact that the energy per broken bond is almost unchanged with respect to the position of the vacancy ( surface , subsurface , bulk ) .",
    "@xcite the deviations are smaller than @xmath20ev , i.e. , close to the estimated error of our method . the largest difference ( @xmath120mev )",
    "is found for @xmath10 between the first and second surface layer .",
    "however , if we consider atomic relaxation , the picture changes qualitatively : for vacancies in the first _ and _ second layer , we find a strong relaxation . due to this relaxation",
    "the formation energy is largely reduced ( up to @xmath50ev , i.e. , the energy gained by atomic relaxation is one order of magnitude larger than for bulk vacancies ) .",
    "it is further interesting to note that the relaxation energy for @xmath10 is about twice as large as for @xmath61 .    for bulk vacancies and vacancies in the third surface layer ,",
    "the lowering of the formation energy due to atomic relaxation is small and almost independent of the type of defect .",
    "it has been shown in sec.[section4a ] that these defects are very similar with respect to defect levels and atomic equilibrium positions .",
    "the presence of the surface also induces differences in formation energy that are less than @xmath121mev indicating the bulklike nature of the subsurface vacancies .",
    "for simulating stm images we employ the tersoff - hamann approach .",
    "@xcite in this approach the tunneling current is proportional to the local density of states at the tip position , @xmath122 , integrated over the interval between the fermi surface and the applied bias @xmath123 :    @xmath124    a positive bias results in imaging the empty states in the specified energy range at position @xmath125 and negative bias in imaging the filled states . by mapping surfaces of constant @xmath126",
    "an isocurrent picture can be simulated .",
    "alternatively the integration might be evaluated for fixed tip height . calculations of various reconstructed semiconductor surfaces  @xcite as well as surfaces with impurities and adsorbates  @xcite have proven this approach to be very useful for the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "figures[fig05](a ) and [ fig05](b ) display our results for the occupied states of the gallium and phosphorus surface vacancy .",
    "the plots were taken at a distance of 3   from the outermost anion layer and include all occupied defect and surface states as well as surface resonances down to @xmath127ev below the valence - band maximum .",
    "the pictures are dominated by the filled dangling bonds above the anions .",
    "thus , for the defect - free surface the stm picture shows the periodicity of the surface lattice and the maxima of the charge density are close to the positions of the surface anions .",
    "if we focus on the cation vacancy [ fig.[fig05](a ) ] we find a localized perturbation in the lattice : the dangling bonds of the two neighboring atoms along the @xmath6 $ ] direction are laterally displaced according to the relaxation of the atoms and clearly appear less intense than the ones farther away from the defect .",
    "this signature of the defect has also been identified in stm experiments .",
    "@xcite however , from the experimental data it is not clear whether this effect is due to atomic relaxation or due to changes in the electronic structure near the vacancy .",
    "we therefore compared the ldos above the surface dangling bonds of the neighboring atoms with that of dangling bonds farther away from the defect .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig06 ] together with an inset defining the lateral positions where the tip height has been varied . in the investigated interval above the surface",
    "we find an exponential decay of the density into the vacuum .",
    "the decay constants at the two maxima are virtually identical ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "we therefore expect that in constant current stm the height difference between the two maxima is not a function of the tunneling current . from fig.[fig06 ] we find this height difference to be @xmath129 , which is very close to the difference in the atomic structure ( @xmath130   , table[tab02 ] ) .",
    "we note that the good agreement between the height corrugation in the electronic and atomic structure is related to the specific structure of the ( 110 ) surface and that of the defect : both rehybridization and charge transfer for this system are small , and our stm simulation mainly shows the filled surface dangling bonds , which are not significantly changed by the presence of the vacancy .",
    "this is true even for nearest - neighbor atoms .",
    "we expect larger deviations for charged surface defects or for more complex systems where defect states are less localized or where rehybridization of atoms near the defect is more prominent .",
    "the stm simulation of the anion surface vacancy is characterized by a depletion of the density of states due to the missing dangling bond [ fig.[fig05](b ) ] .",
    "the perturbation is very localized above the defect site and already the dangling bonds located at the second nearest neighbors are not influenced by the defect .",
    "this agrees well with experimental data for the neutral defect  @xcite and with the short - range character of the defect s perturbation of the surface as discussed in sec.[section3 ] .    simulating the vacancies in the second layer , we get the results shown in figs.[fig05](c ) and [ fig05](d ) . due to the large relaxation of the anion in the surface layer ,",
    "the gallium vacancy displays features similar to the surface phosphorus vacancy : the phosphorus atom above the vacancy has no states within the simulated energy range at that location , which can be explained by the large vertical displacement of this atom . for the phosphorus vacancy",
    "the dangling bonds of the second nearest neighbors are slightly displaced and depressed . as for the cation surface vacancy",
    ", we analyzed this behavior as a function of the tip height .",
    "we find the height difference of the tip to be @xmath131   as compared to @xmath132   structural relaxation .",
    "thus , also the signature of this vacancy is mainly governed by the relaxation of the surface atoms .",
    "we note that the stm simulations of the gallium surface vacancy [ fig.[fig05](a ) ] and of the phosphorus vacancy in the second layer [ fig.[fig05](d ) ] show a remarkable resemblance .",
    "the same holds for the anion surface vacancy [ fig.[fig05](b ) ] and the cation vacancy in the second layer [ fig.[fig05](c ) ] .",
    "therefore , we expect these defects to be hardly discernible in stm measurements of the occupied states",
    ". however , for the gallium vacancy at the surface and @xmath61 in the second layer , the highest occupied defect state has a different symmetry [ figs.[fig02](a ) and [ fig02](e ) ] .",
    "thus , both defects should be distinguishable in experiment .",
    "also @xmath61 at the surface and @xmath10 in the second layer should be distinguishable in experiments such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy because they exhibit very different positions of the highest occupied defect state [ figs.[fig02](b ) and [ fig02](d ) ] .",
    "the simulation of a gallium vacancy in the third layer is virtually identical to that of a defect - free surface [ fig.[fig05](e ) ] . for the phosphorus vacancy ,",
    "a slight depression above the missing atom is found [ fig.[fig05](f ) ] , which , however , might be too weak to be resolved in experiment .",
    "we therefore expect that _ neutral _ vacancies below the second surface layer can not be detected by stm measurements .",
    "for _ charged _ defects the local surface band bending induced by the impurity might change this result qualitatively .",
    "using first - principles total - energy calculations we investigated neutral surface and subsurface vacancies on both sublattices at gap ( 110 ) .",
    "atomic relaxations , electronic structure , as well as formation energies were analyzed , and stm pictures of the various vacancies were simulated .    for both the gallium and the phosphorus surface vacancy , we find a pronounced inward relaxation of nearest neighbors into the defect .",
    "the electronic structure is characterized by a singly occupied deep level for @xmath10 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus we expect them to be amphoteric , indicating that surface vacancies are electrically active and potentially a source of compensation . from the third surface layer on ,",
    "the defects show essentially the same properties as bulk vacancies , namely a breathing - mode - like relaxation of the nearest - neighbor atoms and a triply degenerate acceptor ( @xmath10 ) and donor level ( @xmath61 ) , respectively .",
    "vacancies in the second surface layer are found to be unstable against the formation of vacancy antisite complexes where the nearest - neighbor surface atom moves towards the vacancy site . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the highest occupied level lies near the empty surface band while for @xmath61 it is found at a midgap position .    as can be expected from their lower coordination number , surface vacancies are energetically preferred as compared to subsurface and bulk vacancies .",
    "our results show that , especially at and near the surface , the formation energy of defects is significantly affected by rather large atomic relaxations . for all vacancies with nearest - neighbor atoms in the surface layer",
    "we find relaxation energies that are at least six times higher than for defects with four threefold - coordinated nearest - neighbor atoms .",
    "our calculated stm images of the surface vacancies agree well with available experimental data .",
    "the comparison of the stm simulation with the atomic structure shows that _ neutral _ vacancies at this surface exhibit a close relation between atomic relaxation and height corrugation in the stm picture . to our knowledge , unlike charged subsurface defects , which have been frequently observed using stm , uncharged subsurface vacancies have not been reported by experimental groups so far .",
    "this is consistent with our results for vacancies from the third layer on , which exhibit virtually no interaction with the surface .",
    "however , vacancies in the second layer look like surface vacancies in our simulation . in experiment",
    "they might be discerned from surface vacancies by spectroscopic methods .                                                                  following the notation for the irreducible representation of the @xmath133 point group , we label the states @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) if they are symmetric ( antisymmetric ) with respect to the surface mirror plane .",
