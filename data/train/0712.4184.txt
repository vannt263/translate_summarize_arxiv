    "in the eternally inflationary background driven by the metastable vacua of the landscape @xcite , generally the bubbles with new vacua will nucleate in original vacua @xcite , which are mediated by the cdl instanton @xcite",
    ". however , these bubbles are either empty or dominated by the new vacua .",
    "thus in order to obtain an observable universe , a slow roll inflation and subsequent reheating has to be required inside the bubble .",
    "however , recently , it has been argued that some local quantum fluctuations with the null energy condition violation might be large enough to stride over the barrier among different vacua in the landscape , so that straightly create many thermalized regions in new vacua , some of which may correspond to our observable universe @xcite .",
    "the  thermalized \" here means that the resulting state is a thermal state full of radiation and matter , in which all components are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus this part of region after the thermalization is quite similar to that after the reheating following a slow roll inflation , and so can be followed by a standard frw evolution .",
    "these thermalized regions are referred as the `` islands '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , which in some sense inherits but is actually slightly different from the original idea of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , since here these islands are suggested to origin from large fluctuations in parent vacuum but emerges in a different or baby vacuum .",
    "it is this difference that makes the emergence of the island here inevitably be related to the tunneling in the landscape , especially the hm tunneling @xcite .",
    "we may phenomenally illustrate the island universe by applying the hm instanton .",
    "the hm instanton corresponds a fluctuation which makes the field jump to the top of the potential barrier , and then the field will rapidly roll down along the another side of barrier to the new vacuum and so it can be expected that the same reheating as that after slow roll inflation will occur , see fig.1 . in this sense , the emerging probability of the island in new vacua can be approximately given by that of the hm instanton between different vacua . there have been lots of studies on the hm instanton , e.g. @xcite and recent @xcite . while in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is not quite clear how to calculate the emerging probability of an island .",
    "the island universe should be distinguished from other models based on the upward fluctuations , for examples , the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the state after the fluctuation is assumed to be an observable universe with many structures , and also the recycling universe proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , in which the state after the fluctuation is another inflation state , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more discussions on upward fluctuations .",
    "the island in the landscape can share same remarkable successes with the slow roll inflation .",
    "the reason is that the inflation can be generally regarded as an accelerated or superaccelerated stage , and so can be defined as an epoch when the comoving hubble length decreases , which actually occurs equally during an expansion with the null energy condition violation .",
    "the emergence of the island leads to the decrease of the comoving hubble length , which makes the perturbations initially deep inside the horizon be able to leave the horizon .",
    "the island universe after the thermalization will enter into the usual frw evolution . during the period dominated by the radiation or matter the comoving hubble length is increasing , thus the perturbations on super horizon scale will reenter into the horizon , and become responsible for the structure formation of the observable universe . thus in this sense the emergence of the island naturally leads to a solution to the horizon problem , and also the generation of primordial perturbations .",
    "the total evolution can be depicted in a causal patch diagram shown in fig.2 , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author has firstly calculated the curvature perturbation of an island universe , in which the background vacuum is taken as that with the observed value of cosmological constant and the fluctuation is classically simulated as that driven by a scalar field with a reverse sign in its kinetic term , and it has been shown that the spectrum of metric perturbation before the thermalization is dominated by an increasing mode and is nearly scale invariant , which may induce scale invariant curvature perturbation .",
    "however , whether the resulting spectrum of curvature perturbation is scale invariant is dependent of the physics at the epoch of thermalization .",
    "thus in this sense there is generally an uncertainty .",
    "the case here is slightly similar to that for the bounce , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the emergence of the island in the landscape inevitably involves the fluctuations of many fields , since the landscape can be visualised as the space of a set of fields with a complicated and rugged potential .",
    "thus it will be more interesting to use more scalar fields with the reverse sign in their kinetic terms to phenomenally simulate the creation of island universe . in this case",
    "there is not only the curvature perturbation but the entropy perturbation .",
    "the curvature perturbation may be induced by the entropy perturbation under certain condition , which may be independent of the matching details at the thermalization surface .",
    "this in some sense may relax the uncertainty of spectrum of curvature perturbation leaded by the loophole of metric perturbation propagating through the thermalization surface .",
    "is the thermalization surface , after which the fluctuation is over , the local island universe produced in new vacuum starts its frw evolution , and with the lapsing of time finally will be dominated by new vacuum . when the energy density of parent vacuum is high , there may be not enough efolding number required by observable cosmology , which corresponds to the case that the phase transition point ` c ' in figure is below the ` a ' mode , while if the energy energy of parent vacuum is low enough , there are always some perturbations never reentering and remaining outside the hubble scale after they leave from it during the fluctuation , see ` b ' mode in figure , which means that in this case a part of island is permanently inaccessible to any given observer in island.,width=264 ]    in this paper , we will present a detailed calculation for the spectrum of curvature perturbation of the island universe emerged in the landscape , which will be given in a more general case making the predictions of our model more flexible .",
    "we find that the results obtained can be well related to those of inflation by a simple duality .",
    "in addition , we also simply estimate the non - gaussianity of this curvature perturbation .",
    "the final is our discussion .",
    "in this section , we briefly show some model independent characters of the island universe in the landscape .",
    "though the spawning of island in the landscape is actually a quantum process , it can be regarded phenomenally or semiclassically as an evolution with the null energy condition violation to study , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also earlier work in ref .",
    "when the island emerges , the change of local background may be depicted by the drastic evolution of local hubble parameter ` @xmath0 ' , where the  local \" means that the quantities , such as the scale factor ` @xmath1 ' and ` @xmath0 ' , only character the values in null energy condition violating region .",
    "then we introduce the parameter ` @xmath2 ' defined as @xmath3 , which describes the change of @xmath0 in unit of hubble time . for the null energy condition violating fluctuations , @xmath4 ,",
    "thus @xmath5 can be deduced .",
    "the simplest selection for the scale factor @xmath6 is given by a(t ) ~e^dt [ h]where @xmath7 is negative and runs up to @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a positive parameter dependent of time .",
    "we can obtain @xmath10 , which will be used in the calculations of primordial perturbations .",
    "in addition , we also assume @xmath11 , otherwise the perturbation spectrum will be not nearly scale invariant .",
    "this means that the change of @xmath9 in unite of hubble time must be quite small .",
    "the more rapid the fluctuation is , in principle the stronger it can be @xcite , which in some sense is also a reflection of the uncertainty relation between the energy and time in quantum dynamics . thus to make the fluctuate be strong enough to create the islands of our observable universe , @xmath12 is required @xcite .",
    "thus though during the fluctuation the change of @xmath0 is drastic , the expansion of the scale factor is extremely slow , since we have @xmath13 from eq.([h ] ) for @xmath9 approximately constant .",
    "the efolding number of mode with some scale @xmath14 leaving the horizon before the thermalization can be defined as = , [ caln]where the subscript ` e ' denotes the quantity evaluated at the time of the thermalization , and thus @xmath15 is the last mode to be generated .",
    "when taking @xmath16 , where the subscript ` 0 ' denotes the present time , we generally have @xmath17 , which is required by observable cosmology . by using eq.([caln ] ) , and",
    "also note that the scale factor @xmath1 is nearly unchanged here , we can obtain ( h_eh_i)(t_e_i)^2 , where @xmath18 is the energy scale of original or parent vacuum and @xmath19 is the thermalized temperature after the fluctuation , which is the same as the reheating temperature after the inflation , and also the constant @xmath20 is set in this paper .",
    "when taking @xmath21 and @xmath22gev , we have @xmath23 tev . for a lower @xmath24 , @xmath25 may be taken smaller .",
    "thus it seems that the above condition can be satisfied easily , which indicates that the efolding number required to solve the horizon problem of standard cosmology may be always obtained by selecting a low parent vacuum .",
    "the reason is that the smaller the energy scale of parent vacuum is , the larger its hubble scale is , thus the efolding number , see fig.2 for a further illustration . in principle , @xmath26 should be lower than that the monopoles production needs , while higher than tev .",
    "this can not only avoid the monopole problem afflicting the standard cosmology , but helps to provide a solution to the baryogenesis .",
    "this can be also explained as follows .",
    "the scale of the null energy condition violating region is generally required to be larger than the hubble scale of original vacuum @xcite , see also refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is also assured by the application of the hm instanton action , since in which the region tunnelling to the top of the barrier corresponds to the hubble scale of the original vacuum , which have been understood by using the stochastic approach to inflation @xcite .",
    "this sets the initial value of local evolution of @xmath1 , and since it is nearly unchanged during the fluctuation , we can have @xmath27 , which means that the smaller @xmath28 is , the larger the scale of local thermalized region after the fluctuation is , and thus the efolding number .",
    "in this section , we will study the primordial perturbations of island cosmology in the landscape , and , without loosing generality , will discuss the case with the scalar fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the reverse sign in their dynamical terms , see fig.1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relevant calculations have been done for constant @xmath2 , however , here we will relax the assumption of constant @xmath2 and allow it change , which will make the results more flexible for matching to the observations .",
    "we assume that both fields are uncoupled and regard their potentials not around the top as v(_1)= n_1(3n+1)8 , [ vv1]v(_2)= n_2(3n+1)8 , [ vv2]respectively , where the determination of prefactors has been showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in general both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are positive parameters dependent of the time in different forms .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 and @xmath32 were regarded as constants , thus in eqs.([vv1 ] ) and ( [ vv2 ] ) the integrals in the exponents can be integrated , which actually makes eqs.([vv1 ] ) and ( [ vv2 ] ) have more simple forms . here in order to have a detailed compare of spectrum with the observation we regard @xmath31 and @xmath32 be changed , thus the integrals in the exponents must be reserved .",
    "however , to have a simple equation of entropy perturbation , @xmath33 is constant is assumed here , which means that their changes with the time are same , and also @xmath34 , where @xmath9 is given by eq.([h ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath35 , thus both @xmath36 , which suggests that the potential of both fields are very steep in eqs.([vv1 ] ) and ( [ vv2 ] ) .",
    "the fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 during their evolution will climb up along their potentials , which is determined by the property of such fields , see e.g. refs . @xcite .",
    "thus in this sense they can be suitable for simulating the emergence of island in the landscape , since the emergence of island here actually corresponds to an upward fluctuation along the potential in the landscape .",
    "we can decompose both fields into the field @xmath37 along the field trajectory , and the field @xmath38 orthogonal to the trajectory by making a rotation in the field space d= d_1+d_2 , ds = d_1-d_2 , [ phis]as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the total potential @xmath39 , which is the sum of eqs.([vv1 ] ) and ( [ vv2 ] ) , can be rewritten as @xmath40 , where ( s ) & = & n_1(3n+1)8 + & + & n_2(3n+1)8 [ vphi1]is the potential of @xmath38 field , whose effective mass is given by @xmath41 .",
    "thus we have & & 2 + 6n-3dndn^2 + & & 2- 6 -52ddn(1)^2 , [ mus]where the high order terms like @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been neglected , and in the second line the higher order terms like @xmath44 and @xmath45 also have been neglected .",
    "we educe the second line of eq.([mus ] ) by using the definition of @xmath2 and @xmath46 , and also noting that @xmath47 is far smaller than @xmath2 , since @xmath48 , as has been assumed .",
    "thus we see that eq.([mus ] ) is not dependent of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but only the background parameter @xmath9 or @xmath2 .",
    "the perturbations will be decomposed into both parts after this rotation is done , one is the curvature perturbation induced by the fluctuation of @xmath37 field , and the other is the entropy perturbation induced by the fluctuation of @xmath38 field . in linear order ,",
    "as long as the background trajectory remains straight in field space , the entropy perturbation must be decoupled from the curvature perturbation , which actually can be seen in ref .",
    "when the entropy perturbation is decoupled from the curvature perturbation , the calculation of curvature perturbation is the same as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which only when the increasing mode of metric perturbation before the thermalization may be inherited by the constant model of the curvature perturbation @xmath49 after the thermalization , the spectrum is scale invariant , or the spectrum will be strong blue , whose amplitude is negligible on large scale . in this case",
    "the entropy perturbation @xmath50 may be calculated as follows . in the momentum space , the equation of entropy perturbation can be given by v_k^+(k^2-()^2)v_k = 0 , [ uki]where @xmath51 has been defined and the prime denotes the derivative for the conformal time @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is given by the sum of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , between which is not subtraction sign as usual , since the fields used here have the reverse sign in their dynamical terms , in which @xmath56 is determined by eq.([mus ] ) . note that for @xmath57 .",
    "thus eq.([uki ] ) is a bessel equation and its general solutions are the hankel functions with the order @xmath58 given by v & = & + & & 3 - 2+ddn2 , [ v]where @xmath59 , which has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been used .    in the regime @xmath60 ,",
    "all interesting modes are very deep inside the horizon of the parent vacuum , thus eq.([uki ] ) can be reduced to the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator , in which @xmath61 . in the superhorizon scale , i.e. @xmath62 ,",
    "in which the modes become unstable and increases , the expansion of hankel functions to the leading term of @xmath63 gives v_k(-k)^12-v , [ uk]where the phase factor has been neglected .",
    "the emergence of island goes with the abrupt change of @xmath0 , as has been mentioned in last section .",
    "thus it may be expected that the perturbation amplitude of @xmath64 will continue to change after it leaves the horizon , up to the thermalization epoch .",
    "this can also be explained as follows . to make the analysis simplified , we assume @xmath65 is constant . when @xmath62 , which corresponds to the super horizon scale , from eq.([uki ] ) , we have @xmath66 .",
    "this equation has one increasing solution and one decay solution .",
    "the increasing solution is given by @xmath67 , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the scale factor @xmath1 is nearly unchanged , but since @xmath68 , the change of @xmath64 has to be significant , thus generally one can not obtain that the @xmath69 is constant , which actually occurs only for the slow roll inflation in which approximately @xmath70 .",
    "this result indicates that we should take the value of @xmath64 at the time of thermalization to calculate the amplitude of perturbations .",
    "thus the perturbation spectrum of entropy perturbation is k^3/2p^1/2_s = k^3/2    [ ns]where eq.([v ] ) has been used , which means that the spectrum of entropy perturbation generated during the emergence of island is nearly scale invariant , since @xmath68 and @xmath71 , with a possible tilt determined by the evolution of background .",
    "when @xmath65 is constant , eq.([ns ] ) will be exactly back to that in ref .",
    ".    the spectrum of entropy perturbation can be inherited by the curvature perturbation , which can be accomplished by noting that the entropy perturbation sources the curvature perturbation by ||s [ dotxi]on large scale @xcite , where @xmath72 depicts the motion trajectory of both fields in field space .",
    "when @xmath73 is a constant , it is a straight line . in this case ,",
    "@xmath74 , thus the entropy perturbation will be not decoupled to the curvature perturbation , which also assures the validity of eq.([uki ] ) , or there will be some terms such as @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ". however , if there is a sharp change of field trajectory , @xmath77 must be not equal to @xmath8 , in this case @xmath49 will inevitably obtain a corresponding change induced by @xmath50 by eq.([dotxi ] ) , as has been pointed out and applied in ekpyrotic cosmology @xcite , see also earlier refs .",
    "@xcite and recent studies @xcite on the ekpyrotic collapse with multiple fields .",
    "it may be expected that at the split second before the thermalization @xmath33 will be not constant any more , since around this epoch both fields will be in the top of their potentials , and thus eqs.([vv1 ] ) and ( [ vv2 ] ) depicting the upward fluctuation along the potential are generally not valid any more . in this case , the entropy perturbation will be able to source the curvature perturbation . we assume , for a brief analysis , that before the thermalization the motion of @xmath30 firstly rapidly stops while the other field @xmath29 remains and then will stop moving after several split seconds . following ref .",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to a sharp change from initial value @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "it is this change that leads @xmath49 acquiring a jump induced by the entropy perturbation and thus inherits the nearly scale invariant spectrum of the entropy perturbation . in the rapid transition approximation ,",
    "one has obtained || s , [ xi]where @xmath80 .",
    "the amplitude of entropy perturbation can be calculated at the time of thermalization and given by |v_k(_e)a|      we can note that eqs.([ns ] ) and ( [ pxi ] ) can be related to those of the usual slow roll inflation by replacing @xmath2 as @xmath84 , which actually exactly gives the spectral index and amplitude of slow roll inflation to the first order of slow roll parameters .",
    "this replacement may be regarded as a duality between their scalar spectra , which , in some sense , is a reflection of duality between their background evolutions , i.e. the nearly exponent expansion with @xmath85 and the slow expansion with @xmath86 , see fig.3 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that this duality is valid for constant @xmath65 , here we find that it is still valid when @xmath65 changes .",
    "this result extends again the studies on the dualities of the primordial density perturbation in refs .",
    "@xcite , which discussed the cases of @xmath87 , and @xcite , in which the case of @xmath88 is included .",
    "the duality between the scalar spectra of inflation cosmology and island cosmology indicates that for a slow roll inflation model , we can deduce @xmath89 by studying the details of model to calculate its spectrum , however , by the dual relation showed here we also always can write down a dual @xmath90 for island universe model , both give same scalar perturbation spectra .",
    "for instance , for large field inflation model , we have @xmath91 , then in term of duality @xmath92 , we can take @xmath93 for island universe , one will find that in this case the scalar spectra of both models will be exactly same .",
    "thus in the level of scalar spectrum , the island universe model is actually degenerated with the slow roll inflation model .    , while the black dashed line is the horizon radius @xmath94 . for slow roll inflation , @xmath1",
    "is rapidly increased while @xmath0 is nearly unchanged . for island , @xmath1 is nearly unchanged while @xmath0 is rapidly increased .",

    "for instance , taking @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 , which is well in the region favored by the observation @xcite .",
    "however , it may be more possible that @xmath2 is not a constant . in this case",

    "for instance , taking @xmath165 , we have @xmath166 .",
    "thus dependent of different evolutions , the island universe can have large or small non - gaussianity , which makes it safely lie within the observational bound . here",
    "we do not consider the contribution of the nonlinear relation between @xmath50 and @xmath49 to the non - gaussianty , however , this contribution is actually the same order as that given by the cubic interaction terms of @xmath38 field and thus hardly can affect our rough estimate made here .",
    "we will back the detailed study of non - gaussianty of island universe in the future , noting the significant detection of non gaussianity @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have illustrated and calculated the spectrum of primordial perturbation of the island universe in the landscape .",
    "the landscape can be depicted as the space of a set of fields .",
    "the calculations implemented here closely capture this character of landscape , since in this case the emergence of island will inevitably involve the fluctuations of many fields , and thus the entropy perturbation can be generated , which may induce the curvature perturbation under certain condition .",
    "we showed a detailed results of the spectrum of curvature perturbation induced by the entropy perturbation and discussed that the parameter space required by the observations should correspond to what change of local hubble parameter during the emergence of an island .",
    "we find that in general case the results obtained can be well related to those of slow roll inflation by a simple duality .",
    "in addition , we also simply estimate the non - gaussianity of perturbation .",
    "the results shown here indicates that the island universe in the landscape can be consistent with our real world .",
    "thus given the landscape , the observable universes may be some of many thermalized regions spawned within the eternally inflating background , which appear either by a slow roll inflation after the nucleation of bubbles , followed by the reheating , or by a straightly thermalization in new vacua without the slow roll inflation , like islands , see fig.7 for the illustration .",
    "thus it is interesting to ask how we know whether we live in an emergently thermalized island or in a reheating region after slow roll inflation inside bubble .",
    "the island universe generally has a large non - gaussianity , which can be distinguished by coming observations , as has been shown here .",
    "however , a large non - gaussianity can be also achieved in some special inflation models .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that in the island the tensor amplitude is negligible on large scale @xcite , while there exists a large class of inflation models , such as large field inflation model , with moderate amplitude of tensor perturbation , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for the various inflation models .",
    "thus it seems that the detection of a stochastic tensor perturbation will be consistent with the inflation model , while rule out the possibility that an straightly thermalized region is regarded as our real world .",
    "however , low tensor amplitude on large scale is also not conflicted with the inflation model , e.g. some small field inflation models .",
    "thus in this case other distinguishabilities need to be considered .",
    "the bubble after the nucleation described by the cdl instanton is generally negatively curved , and thus the corresponding universe is an open universe , while the island generated by the upward fluctuation may be closed .",
    "thus in this sense it seems that the curvature measurement of our universe will be significant to make clear where we live in .",
    "however , we still need to look for more distinct signatures for island universe , which will be backed to in intending works .",
    "the emergence of island here is depicted as an upward fluctuation with the null energy condition violation , which might be interesting for the discussions of the initial conditions of observable universe , see refs . @xcite and also recent @xcite , since it might be closely relevant to the solution of above issue .",
    "the emergence probability of island can be approximately given by that of the hm instanton , which is actually exponentially suppressed . however , in the bubble nucleated by the cdl instanton , in order to have an universe like ours , the slow roll inflation with enough period is generally required .",
    "this only can be implemented by having a potential with a long plain above its minimum , which obviously means a fine tuning , since the regions with such potentials are generally expected to be quite rare in a random landscape . while the island of observable universe can actually emerge for any potential , independent of whether the potential has a long plain , as long as we can wait .",
    "thus in principle the island of observable universe can exist in any corner of landscape .",
    "this in some sense brings us an interesting expectation that we might live in a straightly thermalized  island \" in the landscape .",
