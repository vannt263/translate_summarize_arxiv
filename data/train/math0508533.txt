    "the present paper contains a probabilistic analysis of some mathematical model of asynchronous algorithm for parallel simulation . for the detailed discussion of synchronization issues in parallel and",
    "distributed algorithms we refer to  @xcite . here",
    "we give only a brief description of the problem .",
    "in large - scale parallel computation it is necessary to coordinate the activities of different processor which are working together on some common task .",
    "usually such coordination is implemented by using a so - called message - passing system .",
    "this means that a processor shares data with other processors by sending timestamped messages . between sending or receiving the messages the processors work independently .",
    "it can be happened that till the moment of receiving of a message some processor can proceed farther in performing its program than the value of timestamp indicated in this newly received message ; in this case the state of the processor should be _ rolled back _ to the indicated value .",
    "it is clear that due to possible rollbacks the mean speed of a given processor in the computing network will be lower than its proper speed .",
    "one of the most important performance characteristics of the system is the progress of the computing network on large time intervals .",
    "probabilistic models for such system are studied already for twenty years . from the probabilistic point of view these models consists of many relatively independent components which synchronize from time to time their states according to some special algorithm .",
    "the detailed review of all existing publications is out of range of this paper .",
    "we would like to mention only that the bibliography on this subject consists mostly of two group of papers .",
    "the first group of publication @xcite are devoted to the case of two processors .",
    "the paper  @xcite is of special interest since it contains an exhaustive basic analysis of the two - dimensional model and had a big influence on further research .",
    "the case of many processors was studied in @xcite .",
    "an important difference of such models from two - dimensional case is that in a realistic model with more than two processors one message can provoke a multiple rollback of a chain of processors . since the multi - dimensional model is much more complicated for a rigorous study , in the above papers the authors deal with the set of identical processors and their mathematical results",
    "are contained in preparatory sections before large numerical simulations .",
    "it should be noted also that probabilistic models with synchronization mechanism are interesting also for modelling database systems  ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , now synchronization - like interactions are considered as well in the framework of interaction particle systems  @xcite .",
    "the model considered in the present paper is of special interest for the following reasons .",
    "we deals with a nonhomogeneus model consisting of several different processors .",
    "we consider case of message - passing topology other from the topology of complete graph which was considered in all previous papers .",
    "our main interest is the cascade model which pressupose a subordination between processors .",
    "we put forward a conjecture on the cluster behavior of the system : processors can be divided into separated groups which are asymptotically independent and have their own proper performance characteristics .",
    "our main goal is to justify this conjecture .",
    "one should point out that in the case of complete graph topology the cluster decomposition into groups is degenerated and , thus , not interesting .",
    "we describe our model in terms of multi - dimensional continuous time markov process . to get asymptotical performance characteristics of the model we combine two probabilistic methods ( stochastic comparison and foster  lyapunov functions ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : description - of - continuous ] we introduce a general continuous time markov model and define a cascade model as a special subclass of the general model . in  section",
    "[ sec : definition - of - discrete ] we pass to the embedded markov chain .",
    "main problem is now to study a long - time behavior of markov chain with highly nonhomogeneous transition probabilities . to do this",
    "we consider relative coordinates and find groups of processors whose evolution is ergodic ( convergences to a steady state ) in these relative coordinates . to our opinion the method of foster - lyapunov functions seems to be the only one to prove the stability in relative coordinates for the markov chain under consideration .",
    "first of all in section  [ sec : case - n-2 ] we start from the case of two processors ( @xmath1 ) and the analysis here is rather simple and similar to  @xcite . in the study of the three - dimensional case ( section  [ sec : n-3-lyap ] ) the main point is the proof of ergodicity .",
    "we propose an explicit construction of some nonsmooth foster - lyapunov function .",
    "our construction is rather nontrivial as it can be seen by comparing with already existing explicit examples of lyapunov functions ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "all this analysis bring us to some conclusions presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "this section contains decomposition into groups ( clusters ) in the case of cascade model with any number of processors  @xmath0 and our main conjecture  [ con - n - main ] .",
    "we show that the proof of this conjecture could be related with progress in explicit construction of multi - dimensional foster - lyapunov functions .",
    "analysis of random walks in  @xmath2 ( which was done in  @xcite ) shows that , in general , this technical problem may be very difficult . in the next papers we hope to overcome these difficulties by using specific features of our concrete markov processes .",

    "we present here some mathematical model for parallel computations .",
    "there are @xmath0 computing units ( processors ) working together on some common task .",
    "the state of a processor @xmath3 is described by an integer variable @xmath4 which is called a local ( or inner ) time of the processor  @xmath3 and has a meaning of amount of job done by the processor @xmath3 up to the given time moment .",
    "assume that the state @xmath5 of the system evolves in continuous time  @xmath6 .",
    "any change of a state is possible only at some special random time instants .",
    "namely , with any processor  @xmath3 we associate a poissonian flow @xmath7 with intensity  @xmath8 and with a pair @xmath9 of processors we associate a poissonian flow @xmath10 with intensity  @xmath11 .",
    "this means , for example , that @xmath12 is a sequence of independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean  @xmath13 : @xmath14 , and similarly for the flows @xmath15 .",
    "we also assume that all these flows @xmath16 and @xmath15 are mutually independent .",
    "let us now define a stochastic process @xmath17 on the state space @xmath18 according to the following rules .",
    "\\1 ) at time instants @xmath19 the processor @xmath3 increases its local time  @xmath20 by @xmath21 :   @xmath22 .",
    "\\2 ) there is an exchange of information between different processors . at time",
    "instant  @xmath23 the processor  @xmath3 sends a message @xmath24 to the processor  @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that messages reach their destination immediately .",
    "a message @xmath24 coming to node @xmath25 from node  @xmath3 contains an information about local time @xmath26 of the sender  @xmath3 . _ if _ at the time instant  @xmath23 ( when the message @xmath24 arrives to the node  @xmath25 ) we have @xmath27 _ then _ the local time  @xmath28 rolls back to the value @xmath20 : @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , if the processor  @xmath25 rolls back , then all messages sent by the processor @xmath25 during the time interval  @xmath30 where @xmath31 should be eliminated .",
    "this may generate a cascading rollback of local times for some subset of processors .",
    "for example , assume that there is a processor @xmath32 which received a message @xmath33 at some time instant @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "then the local clock  of  @xmath32 should be rolled back to the value @xmath36 : @xmath37 and , moreover , all messages sent by @xmath32 during the interval  @xmath38 should be deleted , and so on .",
    "hence , at time instant @xmath23 a message from  @xmath3 to @xmath25 can provoke a multiple rollback of processor  @xmath39 in the system .",
    "from now we shall consider the following special subclass of the above general model .",
    "a chain of processors @xmath40 is called a _ cascade _ if any processor @xmath41 can send a message only to its right neighbour @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the processor  @xmath0 does not send any message and the processor  @xmath21 does not receive any message . in other words , @xmath43 . a message sent from @xmath41 to @xmath42",
    "can provoke a cascading roll - back of processors @xmath44  .",
    "recall that all above time intervals are exponentially distributed and assumed to be independent . obviously , the stochastic process @xmath45 is markovian .",
    "a very important property is that any `` truncated '' marginal process @xmath46 , @xmath47 , is also markovian .",
    "assume that for any @xmath41 the following limit @xmath48 exists .",
    "then the numbers @xmath49 , @xmath50 , characterize _ performance _ of the model .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to prove the existence of these limits and to calculate them .",
    "note that if we uniformly transform the absolute time scale @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a constant and @xmath53 is a new absolute time scale , the performance characteristics  ( [ eq : v*j - lim ] ) will not change .",
    "consider a sequence @xmath54 of time moments when changes of local time at nodes may happen ( we mean local time updates and moments of sending of messages ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath55 is a sequence of independent identically distributed r.v .",
