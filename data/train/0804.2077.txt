    "a neutral particle in an electric field gradient feels a force .",
    "the field polarizes the particle and , if it has a gradient , pulls on the induced dipole moment . in its ground state , a neutral particle",
    "is always attracted to regions of strong electric field . in other quantum states",
    ", the attraction may either be to strong fields , or to weak fields . here",
    ", we are concerned with the guiding and focussing of strong - field - seeking particles .",
    "static electric fields can not do the job and so a dynamic focussing scheme needs to be used @xcite .",
    "an alternating gradient ( ag ) focusser is a series of lenses , each focussing in one transverse direction and defocussing in the other .",
    "the focus and defocus directions alternate .",
    "particles have stable trajectories through the focusser because they are close to the axis when they travel through the defocussing lenses , and further away when passing through the focussing ones .",
    "the purpose of an alternating gradient guide is to transmit a large number of particles over arbitrarily long distances with as little loss as possible .",
    "such a guide might employ an electrode structure that is uniform along the beamline , with the alternation achieved by switching the applied voltages - alternation in time .",
    "alternatively , the voltages can be fixed with the alternating gradients set up by the electrode structure itself - alternation in space .",
    "early experiments with alternating gradient structures used two - rod and four - rod geometries to focus polar molecules , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these same ideas were later applied to cold atoms , demonstrating that an atomic beam or fountain could be focussed this way @xcite . of considerable interest at present",
    "is the application of ag focussing to the stark deceleration of strong - field seeking molecules .",
    "prototype alternating gradient decelerators have been demonstrated experimentally @xcite , and their focussing properties investigated in detail both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . for heavy molecules to be decelerated to rest , these decelerators will need to employ very many stages of ag focussing , typically 100 lenses or more .",
    "recently , a long ag guide with a double bend has been used to guide slow molecules from an effusive source @xcite . as buffer gas cooling technology advances , it is likely that such guides will be more widely used as efficient tools for extracting molecules from the cold buffer gas @xcite .",
    "an ag guide has also been used to separate conformers of c@xmath0h@xmath1no by exploiting the selectivity of the guide to the ratio of dipole moment to mass @xcite .",
    "the theoretical analysis we present here is suitable for describing all of these linear guiding structures .",
    "it can also be applied directly to other alternating gradient structures such as a storage ring for strong - field seeking molecules @xcite or linear ac traps of the kind demonstrated for both molecules @xcite and atoms @xcite .",
    "the physics we present also carries over directly to ac traps with cylindrical symmetry because the same terms appear in the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the anharmonic forces present in ag guides and traps for neutral particles tend to be detrimental to the phase space acceptance , often reducing this by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "similarly , these nonlinearities reduce the quality of the images in an ag focussing system .",
    "this problem has long been recognized . in reference",
    "@xcite for example , molecules were guided in a four rod geometry with the rod positions carefully chosen to optimize the linearity of the forces , resulting in a large improvement in transmission over previous two rod geometries .",
    "the optimization of electrode geometry with respect to minimizing nonlinear forces has been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have been used to predict the performance of several types of ag guides @xcite , decelerators @xcite and traps @xcite all confirming the hugely deleterious effects of the nonlinearities .    in this paper",
    "we use a mixture of analytical and numerical techniques to calculate the effect of the nonlinear forces on the particle trajectories and the phase space acceptance of an ag guide .",
    "we start by reviewing the linear theory since this is the foundation for the analysis of nonlinearities .",
    "it is well known that the motion consists of an oscillation driven at the frequency of alternation , called the ` micromotion ' , superposed on a slower oscillation of larger amplitude called the ` macromotion ' .",
    "a good approximate description of the macromotion is obtained using an effective potential .",
    "the anharmonic terms modify this effective potential and so alter the phase space acceptance .",
    "the leading anharmonic terms in this potential are a quartic term along with a term that couples together motion in the two transverse directions .",
    "the quartic term in the potential leads to terms in the force that are cubic in the transverse coordinates .",
    "we treat this quartic term analytically , deriving an expression for the phase - space acceptance in the presence of this term . to understand the effect of the transverse coupling term we apply a perturbation method which reveals the nature of the coupled trajectories and shows that this term tends to decrease the phase space acceptance even when it increases the depth of the effective potential .",
    "we use numerical techniques throughout to support the theory , test the approximations and obtain results when the perturbation approach ceases to be valid .",
    "we apply our analysis to some example ag guides for neutrals .",
    "our starting point is equation ( 8) of reference @xcite , which gives a suitable form for the electrostatic potential inside an ag guide , @xmath2 , as a function of the transverse coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 :    @xmath5    this equation is derived by writing down a multipole expansion of the potential , and then eliminating terms that are unsuitable for a guide .",
    "the scale factors , @xmath6 and @xmath7 characterize the size of the electrode structure and the applied voltages , while @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are dimensionless constants representing the sizes of the dipole , hexapole and decapole terms in the expansion .    a neutral particle inside the guide will be polarized by the electric field to a degree that depends on the particle polarizability and on the magnitude of the field .",
    "the interaction of this induced polarization with the electric field changes the potential energy of the particle ; this is the stark shift , @xmath11 .",
    "if the electric field is spatially inhomogeneous , so too is @xmath11 , and there is an associated force acting on the particle , @xmath12 . for our present purpose , we do not need to know the detailed dependence of the stark shift on @xmath13 , the magnitude of the electric field .",
    "we need only know that , for sufficiently small electric fields , the stark shift is quadratic in @xmath13 , @xmath14 , while for sufficiently large electric fields it becomes linear , @xmath15 .",
    "the constants of proportionality in the two cases are known as the polarizabilty , @xmath16 , and the dipole moment , @xmath17 . whether the electric field is considered small or large",
    "depends on the polarizability of the particle .",
    "for example , the stark shift of a caf molecule is in the linear regime at a field of 100kv / cm , whereas the stark shift of a li atom is quadratic in the same field .",
    "we now impose the additional constraint that @xmath18 , meaning that the electric field in the guide is dominated by a constant term , and that the decapole term is much smaller than the hexapole term .",
    "we then obtain the following approximate expression for the @xmath19th power of the electric field magnitude , valid throughout the region where @xmath20 :    @xmath21    in this equation , we have set the redundant scale parameter @xmath8 to unity and have introduced scaled transverse coordinates @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the electric field at the centre of the guide .",
    "the neglected terms are of order @xmath25 , @xmath26 and higher .",
    "since @xmath19 can be any number , we see from ( [ eq : e ] ) that the potential in which the particles move always has the same functional dependence on the transverse coordinates , irrespective of whether the stark shift is linear , quadratic , or intermediate .",
    "although we have treated the case of a long guide , similar terms appear in the treatment of cylindrically symmetric traps @xcite , and so our analysis could also be readily applied to that case .    in writing the equations of motion , we may either use the axial coordinate , @xmath27 , or the time , @xmath28 , as the independent variable .",
    "the former is most appropriate for long guiding structures , while the latter tends to be used for trapping geometries .",
    "we will use @xmath27 throughout , writing the equations of motion as    @xmath29    where the primes denote differentiation with respect to the scaled axial coordinate @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are dimensionless parameters that depend on the character of the stark shift , but not on the spatial coordinates . for a linear stark shift , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and    @xmath36    for a quadratic stark shift , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and    @xmath39",
    "we have introduced the quantity @xmath40 , which characterizes the stark shift on the axis of the guide in terms of the forward kinetic energy , and will be useful later in the paper .",
    "we have written the equations of motion for a lens that focusses in the @xmath4-direction when @xmath9 is positive . for focussing in the @xmath3-direction , simply interchange @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we note from ( [ eq : eqnofmotion ] ) that the dominant term in the force is linear in the transverse coordinate , focussing in one plane and defocussing in the orthogonal plane .",
    "in addition to the desirable linear term , there is a term cubic in the transverse displacement , and also a nonlinear transverse coupling term . by a suitable choice of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , it is possible to eliminate one or other of the nonlinear terms , but simultaneous elimination of both nonlinear terms is impossible without also setting @xmath31 to zero .",
    "for example , when the stark shift is linear , the cubic term in the force can ( in principle ) be eliminated by choosing @xmath43 ; alternatively , the coupling term can be removed by choosing @xmath44 ; the elimination of both terms is clearly not possible .",
    "thus , the lenses in an alternating gradient guide for neutral particles are necessarily aberrant . more generally , the values of @xmath33 and @xmath32 are linearly related via @xmath45 .",
    "this relationship shows that it is also impossible for both @xmath32 and @xmath33 to be negative , implying , as we will show later , that no matter how the electrodes are arranged at least one of the terms is detrimental to the transmission of the guide .",
    "in ( [ eq : eqnofmotion ] ) , we are considering the case where @xmath46 , and so the coefficient of the linear term is much larger than the coefficients of the nonlinear terms .",
    "it is therefore tempting to suppose that the effect of the nonlinearity on the trajectories is small .",
    "however , in going from a focussing lens to a defocussing lens , the linear term changes sign ( as it must ) but the nonlinear terms do not . the alternating gradient guide can support a stable beam because the envelope of the beam is always smaller in the defocussing lenses than in the focussing lenses .",
    "for this reason , the net effect of the linear forces is to confine the molecules , but this trajectory - averaged confining force is considerably weaker than the linear forces of the individual lenses .",
    "by contrast , the nonlinear forces are identical in the two lenses and simply add up .",
    "it follows that , even though the nonlinear terms in the individual lenses are small , their role is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the guided particles .",
    "throughout this paper we consider a linear ag guide consisting of alternate converging and diverging lenses each of length @xmath47 , separated by gaps of length @xmath48 . to understand the effect of the nonlinear forces",
    ", we first analyze the motion in the absence of the nonlinearities .",
    "this idealized motion has been discussed in some detail in reference @xcite and is based on the original work of courant and snyder @xcite who discussed the same problem in the context of charged particle focussing .",
    "we give a brief summary of this theory here , and extend the discussion of reference @xcite .      neglecting the nonlinear terms , we write the equation of motion in one dimension as    @xmath49    here , @xmath50 , where g(z ) is a function whose value is @xmath51 in a focussing lens , @xmath52 in a defocussing lens , and 0 in a drift space .",
    "we know the solution in each region of constant @xmath53 .",
    "for example , the solution inside a focussing lens is given by    @xmath54    the solution inside a defocussing lens is identical to ( [ eq : focusmatrix ] ) , with the replacement of @xmath31 by @xmath55 , and the transfer matrix denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "for a region of free space , let @xmath57 in ( [ eq : focusmatrix ] ) and call the matrix @xmath58 .",
    "knowing the solutions in each of the separate regions , we can construct the full trajectories piecewise , but the courant - snyder formalism offers a far better approach .",
    "this involves looking for a general solution of the form    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is a @xmath61-dependent amplitude function that has the same periodicity as the ag array , @xmath62 is a z - dependent phase , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined by the initial conditions .",
    "by substitution we find that ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) is a valid solution to ( [ eq : eqmotionlinear ] ) provided    @xmath67    and    @xmath68    it appears that all we have achieved is the replacement of the differential equation for @xmath69 by a more complicated differential equation for @xmath70 .",
    "the advantage is that we will never have to solve this new differential equation .",
    "we already know the solution to ( [ eq : eqmotionlinear ] ) , but piecewise , and our aim is to express this in a convenient form . from ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) we have    @xmath71    where    @xmath72    using ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) and ( [ eq : xprime ] ) we find the relationship between the coordinates @xmath73 at position @xmath61 and those at position @xmath74 , @xmath75 being the periodicity of the ag array . we make use of the periodicity constraint on @xmath60 , @xmath76 ( and hence also on @xmath16 ) and thus obtain :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and    @xmath79    is the phase advance per unit cell .",
    "since the integral is taken over a full period , @xmath17 is independent of @xmath61 .",
    "the matrix appearing in ( [ eq : csm ] ) is known as the courant - snyder matrix , @xmath80 .",
    "the procedure to obtain @xmath70 is now straightforward .",
    "we illustrate this procedure for a simple guide with no gaps .",
    "consider an alternating sequence of focussing and defocussing lenses , each of length @xmath47 , with @xmath81 defined to be at the entrance of a focussing lens .",
    "we first obtain an explicit expression for the transfer matrix between a point @xmath61 inside a focussing lens and the equivalent point one lattice unit further downstream .",
    "this matrix is @xmath82 .",
    "we then calculate @xmath83 , which , from the courant - snyder matrix is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "the explicit result is @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we calculate @xmath60 by equating the upper right hand element of @xmath86 to that of @xmath80 , obtaining    @xmath87    for @xmath88 .",
    "we can apply the same procedure to a point @xmath61 inside a defocussing lens ( i.e. @xmath89 ) .",
    "the result for @xmath70 is identical to ( [ eq : explicitbeta ] ) with the replacement of @xmath31 by @xmath55 and the replacement of @xmath61 by @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath60 has period @xmath91 , we now know it everywhere , and since @xmath92 can be calculated directly from @xmath70 we have the complete general solution to the equation of motion in the form of ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) . this same procedure can equally well be applied to more complicated guiding structures .      , as a function of the parameter @xmath93 . solid line : uniform aperture throughout the guide .",
    "dashed line : aperture at defocussing lenses only .",
    "dotted line : approximate result for small micromotion .",
    "[ fig : linacc],width=340 ]    returning to the case of a general guide , particles enter with a range of transverse positions and angles and we wish to know which of them are transmitted . consider a particle whose initial conditions are given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as in ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) . using the first line of ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) to form the quantity @xmath94 , and recalling that @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we find the invariant    @xmath98    suppose we record the transverse position and angle of the particle at the longitudinal positions @xmath99 , for a large number of integer values of @xmath100 .",
    "then a plot of these points on a phase - space diagram , whose axes are @xmath41 and @xmath101 , traces out the ellipse defined by ( [ eq : csinvariant ] ) .",
    "if we repeat this procedure for a different value of @xmath61 , the shape of the ellipse evolves periodically with @xmath61 according to ( [ eq : csinvariant ] ) , but its area remains the same , @xmath102 .",
    "a distribution of particles having @xmath103 fills the ellipse .",
    "if the guide has a constant transverse aperture with walls at @xmath104 , then it is clear from ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) that all particles having @xmath105 will be transmitted indefinitely provided that @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the maximum value of @xmath70 . if this condition is satisfied , the transverse extent of the beam never exceeds the transverse aperture of the guide .",
    "particles that have @xmath108 may also be transmitted by the guide provided that the turning points of the macromotion ( the cosine factor in ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) ) never coincide with the turning points of the micromotion ( the amplitude function in ( [ eq : trajeq ] ) ) . that condition may occur for a large number of particles if @xmath109 is a rational number , @xmath17 being the phase advance per unit cell defined by ( [ eq : mu ] ) . however , these `` resonances '' in the phase - space acceptance become very narrowly centred on these special values of @xmath17 once the guide is long compared to the wavelength of the macromotion , and we can usually ignore them . then",
    ", the transverse phase - space acceptance is simply @xmath110 . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", the maximum value of @xmath60 always occurs in the centre of a focussing lens . returning to our specific example of a gapless guide ,",
    "this is explicitly seen in ( [ eq : explicitbeta ] ) at @xmath111 .",
    "it follows that , in this case , the transverse phase space - space acceptance in one dimension is    @xmath112    since we are using @xmath61 as the independent variable , the acceptance has the units of @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "there are , of course , two transverse directions , and the 2d transverse acceptance is simply the square of the above formula .    so far , we have supposed that the transverse aperture formed by the electrodes of the guide is uniform along its entire length . for many electrode geometries ,",
    "this is a poor approximation .",
    "an interesting case is that of alternating two - rod lenses , discussed in @xcite and used in all experimental work on alternating gradient deceleration reported to date . here , the electrodes lie in the defocussing plane and",
    "there is no aperture at all in the focussing plane .",
    "the maximum beam envelope still occurs at the centre of the focussing lens , but there is no aperture at this point for the beam to crash into . instead ,",
    "the appropriate limiting value of @xmath60 to insert into the acceptance equation is its value at the entrance to the defocussing lens . as a result ,",
    "the phase - space acceptance increases . for the case of a gapless guide with an aperture at the defocussing lenses only ,",
    "the second term in the denominator of ( [ eq : exampleacceptance ] ) is replaced by @xmath115 .",
    "the acceptance in one transverse direction of a gapless guide is plotted in figure [ fig : linacc ] , for both kinds of transverse aperture .",
    "we see that when the aperture is defined only by the defocussing lenses ( dashed line ) the 1d acceptance peaks at a slightly higher value of @xmath93 where it is almost twice as large . later in this paper",
    ", we will make a `` small micromotion approximation '' which amounts to neglecting the modulation of @xmath60 , replacing it by the constant value @xmath116 . in this approximation ,",
    "the phase space acceptance in one dimension becomes @xmath117 . for a gapless guide",
    ", this approximate acceptance is shown by the dotted line in figure [ fig : linacc ] .",
    "we see that the approximate result agrees well with the exact results when @xmath118 , because the micromotion amplitude is indeed small in this regime . as @xmath93 increases ,",
    "the approximate result overestimates the acceptance . at @xmath119 for example , the approximate acceptance is 31% larger than the exact value with uniform aperture , and 2% larger for an aperture at the defocussing lenses only .",
    "we turn now to some specific examples .",
    "consider first a beam of ground state caf molecules travelling at 350 m/s into a gapless guide having @xmath120kv / cm and @xmath121 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath122 , and with @xmath123 mm the acceptance reaches its maximum value of 39mmmrad when the lenses are 24 mm in length .",
    "thus , the acceptance of the guide , which can transport the molecules over an arbitrarily long distance , is the same of that of a 1mm@xmath124 square cross - section pipe of length 26 mm . as a second example , consider li atoms launched with a speed of 10 m/s from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) into the same guide .",
    "here , @xmath125 , the optimal lens length is 4 mm and the transverse acceptance is 230mm.mrad , equivalent to 2.3mm.m / s in position - velocity space .",
    "this acceptance is larger than the phase - space area occupied by the atoms in a typical li mot , indicating that all the atoms can be successfully transported .",
    "the previous section showed how to calculate the transverse phase - space acceptance , but often the source is unable to fill this acceptance area completely .",
    "the final output of particles depends on the overlap between the acceptance and the phase - space area occupied by the particles at the guide s entrance , which we call the fill factor . as an illustration ,",
    "consider a beam formed in a supersonic expansion , passing through a small aperture ( a skimmer ) and then into the guide .",
    "for the purposes of calculation it is convenient to proceed in the opposite direction .",
    "we calculate the phase - space acceptance at the entrance of the guide , project this back through the skimmer and onto the source to find out what fraction is filled by the source . in practice , the source is usually large enough and divergent enough to completely fill the part of the acceptance that fits through the skimmer , and we assume this to be the case in the calculation that follows .",
    "( in units of @xmath126 ) between the entrance of the guide and an upstream square aperture of side @xmath126 .",
    "the result shown is for the particular case of a gapless guide with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "[ fig : fillfactor ] ]    let us write the phase - space ellipse accepted by the guide as    @xmath129    here , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , where @xmath81 is defined to be at the entrance of the guide .",
    "we project this ellipse through a distance @xmath133 and so obtain a new ellipse with coefficients @xmath134 .",
    "the relationship between the coefficients is    @xmath135    this is easily derived using the drift matrix @xmath58 ( see ( [ eq : focusmatrix ] ) ) .    at this point",
    ", we can calculate the area of that part of the phase - space ellipse that fits through the skimmer aperture .",
    "the aperture provides a constraint in the @xmath41 direction , but not in the @xmath101 direction . integrating the ellipse between @xmath136",
    ", we obtain the area ,    @xmath137    repeating this for the other transverse direction , and multiplying together the two results yields the 2d transverse phase - space acceptance of the entire guide and aperture setup .",
    "this result , divided by the 2d acceptance of the guide alone , @xmath138 , gives the fill factor .",
    "figure [ fig : fillfactor ] shows an example of how the fill factor decreases as @xmath139 increases , stressing the importance of minimizing the distance between the guide and any aperture placed upstream .",

    "even though the coupling is nonlinear , we have found the _",
    "normal modes _ familiar from the theory of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators . indeed , applying the multiple scales method to a pair of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators results in the relationship @xmath312 , which is remarkably similar to ( [ eq : xigammacurveszerob1 ] ) .",

    "the normal mode frequencies are found to be    @xmath316    we see that the frequency is lowered when @xmath32 ( and hence @xmath317 ) is positive because the coupling term reduces the trap depth along the diagonals of the guide .",
    "the opposite is true when @xmath32 is negative .",
    "note that the normal modes with @xmath318 and @xmath311 have equal frequencies , unlike the linear coupling case where the coupling removes the frequency degeneracy .",
    "there is another important difference too : the frequency of the normal mode differs from @xmath17 by an amount that depends on the square of the oscillation amplitude ( the total energy ) .",
    "this is similar to the frequency shift caused by the cubic term discussed earlier , and quite different from a linear coupling whose normal mode frequencies are independent of amplitude .    the two maxima in figure [ fig : contours ]",
    "are encircled by contours with @xmath319 . in this range , the two transverse oscillations exchange energy completely .",
    "looking at the contours near @xmath320 , the phase difference is zero when the amplitude of one mode has its maximum value , zero again when it has its minimum value , and reaches a maximum when the amplitudes of the two modes are equal .",

    "although the amplitude of one mode does grow at the expense of the other , the amplitudes do not exchange completely .",
    "the contours are open and the phase difference increases continually .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that motion with @xmath326 or @xmath327 is of this type , and does not yield any exchange of amplitude at all .",
    "the motions uncouple when all the energy is in one direction , in stark contrast to the classic motion of linearly coupled oscillators which exchange energy fully even when one oscillator begins at rest .",
    "for a given value of @xmath325 , the large @xmath287 contour has maxima at @xmath320 and @xmath328 , whose value , @xmath329 , is given by ( [ eq : ximax1 ] ) .",
    "the small @xmath287 contour has a maximum at @xmath330 with value    @xmath331    due to the exchange of energy between the transverse modes , there will be some particles whose maximal amplitudes of oscillation take them outside the boundaries of the guide , even though their initial amplitudes are within these boundaries .",
    "these particles are lost from the guide in the presence of coupling , and would not have been in its absence .",
    "we note again that the value of @xmath256 dictates the rate at which the amplitudes exchange , but not the degree of exchange .",
    "if the guide is infinitely long , and @xmath256 is small enough that our approximations hold , the loss of acceptance is independent of the size of @xmath317 .",
    "a larger value only results in the particles being lost more quickly , but those same particles will eventually be lost even when the coupling term is infinitesimally small . similarly , and somewhat counter - intuitively , the same particles are lost whether the nonlinear term increases or decreases the depth of the guide ( along the diagonals ) .    at the present level of approximation , it is straightforward to determine whether a particle with given initial conditions will be transmitted through the guide .",
    "we first relate the invariant quantity , @xmath332 , to the initial conditions .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath63 , the initial values of @xmath333 are related to the initial conditions via    @xmath334    and similarly for @xmath335 . with these , we can form @xmath336 and @xmath337 and hence @xmath304 from ( [ eq : xigammacurveszerob1 ] ) .",
    "an equivalent approach is to realize that , to lowest order in @xmath63    @xmath338    knowing @xmath304 we use ( [ eq : ximax1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ximax2 ] ) to find the maximum value of @xmath287 for the particle , and hence the maximum values of @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "these maxima will eventually be reached ( unless @xmath341 exactly ) , and so the particle will be guided indefinitely if these are smaller than the boundaries of the guide , and will be lost with certainty if they are larger .",
    "we applied this algorithm to a large number of particles to find the set that are transmitted by a guide in the presence of a very small transverse coupling .",
    "we find that the coupling reduces the acceptance of an infinitely long guide to 72% of its acceptance in the absence of nonlinear forces .",
    "this is a general result that depends only on the coupling term being small enough that our lowest order approximation is valid . in the absence of coupling ,",
    "the acceptance ellipses in the @xmath342 and @xmath343 phase spaces are uniformly dense - all particles that lie inside both ellipses are transmitted .",
    "this ceases to be true when the coupling is turned on .",
    "in fact , the sizes of the ellipses that enclose the stable particles do not change , but these particles are no longer distributed uniformly within them .",
    "for example , a particle that is close to the boundary of the ellipse in @xmath342 may be driven out of the guide if it also happens to lie close to the boundary in @xmath343 , but it will be successfully transmitted if it happens to lie close to the origin in @xmath343 .",
    "thus , the phase space acceptance in one direction has a dense region around the origin , becoming less dense towards the boundaries .    by eliminating the independent variable , @xmath259 , from ( [ eq : diffxi ] ) and ( [ eq : diffgamma ] ) , we have obtained a great deal of insight into the coupled motion of the particles .",

    "the points joined by a dashed line were calculated in the small micromotion approximation . [",
    "fig : coupledacceptance ] ]    having understood how the acceptance is reduced by a very small nonlinear coupling , we now consider larger values of the coefficient @xmath32 .",
    "applying the multiple scales method to higher orders in @xmath63 becomes quite awkward mathematically , so we turn to numerical methods .",
    "then we have a choice : we could either solve the exact differential equations given by ( [ eq : eqnofmotioncomplete ] ) , or we could use the small - micromotion approximation and solve ( [ eq : reducedeqsofmotion ] ) instead . in the former case , the step size needs to be chosen small relative to the micromotion wavelength , while for the latter it need only be small relative to the macromotion wavelength . for this reason ,",
    "the approximate method is computationally faster by the ratio of the two wavelengths .",
    "figure [ fig : coupledacceptance ] shows the results obtained by both methods for a gapless guide containing 100 lenses each having @xmath354 .",
    "the two methods give similar results , the greatest difference being for large positive values of @xmath32 where neglect of the micromotion underestimates the true acceptance .    in line with our discussion in section [ sec : smallcoupling ] , the acceptance drops on either side of the @xmath231 position , due to the exchange of energy between transverse modes .",
    "this loss mechanism is fully established once @xmath32 is large enough that a cycle of the slow amplitude and phase oscillations is completed within the length of the guide .",
    "the width of the sharp peak depends inversely on this length , a longer guide resulting in a narrower central peak . away from the central peak",
    "there is a striking asymmetry between positive and negative values of @xmath32 .",
    "this happens because there are two effects that cause the acceptance to depend on @xmath32 , one which reduces the acceptance for both positive and negative @xmath32 , and another which reduces the acceptance on the positive side but increases it on the negative side .",
    "the first effect is the exchange of energy between the two transverse oscillations , already discussed above .",
    "importantly , the wavelength of the amplitude and phase oscillations , @xmath353 , is a function of the particle s transverse energy , @xmath24 , and its value of @xmath304 .",
    "those particles with @xmath304 near 1/4 will have longer energy - exchanging wavelengths than others , and so this loss mechanism continues to be active as @xmath356 increases . as a result the central peak in the figure has broad wings where there continues to be more particle loss with increasing @xmath356 , reducing the acceptance on both sides of the central peak .",
    "the second effect is a direct result of the change in shape of the effective potential with the value of @xmath32 .",
    "as @xmath32 increases , the nonlinear term makes the effective potential shallower along the diagonals of the guide , allowing an increasingly large fraction of the particles to escape along these directions . for negative values of @xmath32 ,",
    "the guide becomes deeper along the diagonals , allowing extra particles to be confined .",
    "it so happens that , for negative @xmath32 , the two effects nearly cancel so that the acceptance is nearly a constant on the negative side .",
    "it is also important to note that the coupling term leaves the shape of the effective potential unaltered along the principal axes . for all negative @xmath32 , the potential depth is shallowest along these axes . in the presence of the coupling ,",
    "particles tend to explore many different regions of the guide , and so for many particles , increasing the potential depth along the diagonals does not improve the confinement since these particles can still escape along the principal axes .",
    "figure [ fig : coupledxytrajectory ] shows an example of the motion in the @xmath357-plane when @xmath354 , comparing @xmath358 to @xmath231 . in the absence of coupling the particle moves in a closed ellipse .",
    "the coupling results in a far more complicated trajectory , with the particle visiting far more points in the plane .",
    "-plane , for a gapless guide with @xmath359 .",
    "the initial conditions were arbitrarily chosen . when @xmath231 the trajectory is a closed ellipse ( thick line ) .",
    "when the transverse motions are coupled ( thin line , @xmath358 ) , the trajectory is more complicated and the particle visits many more points in the plane .",
    "[ fig : coupledxytrajectory],width=302 ]    finally in this section , we consider the effect of the transverse coupling on the example guides that we examined earlier . in the case of the two - rod guide used in many previous experiments on focussing , guiding and decelerating",
    ", @xmath32 is always negative and therefore has little effect on the acceptance .",
    "this , along with its simplicity , is a great advantage of the two - rod geometry .",
    "the four rod guide with two - pole symmetry discussed in reference @xcite has @xmath360 when the stark shift is linear , and this reduces the acceptance to about 40% of the value it takes in the absence of the coupling ( for @xmath119 and @xmath361 ) . when the stark shift is quadratic @xmath362 in this geometry and so the normalized acceptance is about 70% .",
    "the four rod bent guide used for guiding molecules in reference @xcite has @xmath363 when the stark shift is linear .",
    "this very large value for @xmath32 is a great disadvantage of this geometry since it reduces the acceptance enormously .",
    "it is , of course , necessary to consider the higher order terms to get a complete picture in this case .",
    "we return now to the general case where both @xmath364 and @xmath365 are nonzero .",
    "figure [ fig : contoursbothterms ] shows contours of ( [ eq : xigammacurves ] ) for several different values of the ratio @xmath366 , along with colour maps to indicate the values , @xmath304 , of the contours . as before ,",
    "the fixed points in these plots correspond to the coupled stationary modes .",
    "the ones at @xmath367 are the diagonal in - phase and anti - phase normal modes , while the fixed point at @xmath368 represents the clockwise and anticlockwise circular modes .",
    "when @xmath366 is small , as in ( a ) , the plot closely resembles the @xmath301 case shown in figure [ fig : contours ] .",
    "the main difference is that a greater fraction of the contours encircle the two maxima that correspond to the normal modes .",
    "part ( b ) of the figure shows the contours for @xmath369 .",
    "the saddle point has been replaced by a minimum meaning that the circular modes , as well as the diagonal modes , are stable .",
    "all motion involves a complete exchange of energy between one transverse direction and the other .",
    "as @xmath366 is increased further , the area of the plot containing contours centred on @xmath368 grows .",
    "eventually , once @xmath370 as in part ( c ) of the figure , this area includes all the contours . with a ratio greater than 1 , e.g. @xmath371 as shown in ( d ) ,",

    "( a ) @xmath372 , ( b ) @xmath369 , ( c ) @xmath370 , ( d ) @xmath371 . [ fig : contoursbothterms ] ]    it is clear from figure [ fig : contoursbothterms ] that the coupled stationary modes can be stable or unstable , depending on the ratio of @xmath364 to @xmath365 . to find the stability condition",
    ", we form the hessian matrix of the left - hand - side of ( [ eq : xigammacurves ] ) .",
    "a fixed point is a stable one if the determinant of this matrix is positive . using this procedure",
    "it is straightforward to show that the normal modes are stable provided @xmath373 , and the circular modes are stable when @xmath374",
    ".    we can also easily find the spatial frequencies of the coupled stationary modes , following the same procedure as before .",
    "the frequency in the @xmath41 direction is @xmath375 . with the help of ( [ eq : slowdiffs3 ] ) we find the normal mode frequency to be    @xmath376    and the frequency of the circular mode to be    @xmath377    comparing these with equations ( [ eq : frequencyexpansioncubic ] ) and ( [ eq : frequencycoupled ] )",
    ", we see that , to this order in @xmath63 , the change in frequency resulting from the inclusion of both cubic and coupling terms together is just the sum of the changes introduced by each term alone .",
    ", @xmath361 , plotted as a function of @xmath32 for various values of @xmath33 .",
    "the acceptance has been normalized to the value obtained when both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are zero .",
    "the points are the results of numerical simulations using the effective potential , ( [ eq : veff ] ) .",
    "the solid lines show the product of the numerical acceptance calculated with @xmath235 ( as in figure [ fig : coupledacceptance ] ) with the analytical result for the cubic term , equations ( [ eq : cubicf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cubicf2]).[fig : bothterms ] ]    to find the 2d phase space acceptance over a wide range of @xmath33 and @xmath32 we solved the equations of motion for a large number of particles using the effective potential given by ( [ eq : veff ] ) .",
    "the results for a 100-lens gapless guide with @xmath378 are shown by the points in figure [ fig : bothterms ] , for @xmath379 and @xmath380 .",
    "for all values of @xmath33 , the results are rather similar to the @xmath235 result shown in figure [ fig : coupledacceptance ] - there is a narrow spike centred at @xmath231 , a decline in acceptance for positive @xmath32 and a plateau for negative @xmath32 .",
    "this similarity suggests a hypothesis , which we could write symbolically as @xmath381 . in words ,",
    "the hypothesis is that the total acceptance is the product of the one obtained from the linear theory , @xmath224 , the factor @xmath225 given by ( [ eq : cubicf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cubicf2 ] ) , which is independent of @xmath32 and accounts for the cubic term , and a third factor , @xmath382 , that accounts for the coupling term independently of @xmath33 and is plotted in figure [ fig : coupledacceptance ] .",
    "the lines in figure [ fig : bothterms ] are plots of this product form , showing that for a large region of the parameter space this simple method agrees with the full numerical calculation to within a few percent .",
    "the largest discrepancies occur when both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are large and positive . here , the numerical calculations show that the acceptance is considerably larger than the product form suggests , e.g. 70% larger when @xmath383 , @xmath384 . away from this region ,",
    "the next largest discrepancies occur when @xmath32 is small and negative .",
    "the numerical calculations show that in this region the acceptance tends to be larger than the product form predicts , by up to 20% .    we are , at last , ready to put everything together to find the best way of building alternating gradient guides , decelerators and traps .",
    "we first found that , in the linear theory , the 2d phase - space acceptance is proportional to @xmath385 , and so to the value of @xmath386 .",
    "however , making @xmath9 as large as possible may not be the best strategy , because of the detrimental effects of positive @xmath33 and @xmath32 which are related to one another through @xmath9 : @xmath387 .",
    "if we make @xmath9 too large , the increased acceptance suggested by the linear theory will not be realizable due to the resulting large value of @xmath32 .",
    "decreasing @xmath32 by increasing @xmath33 does not necessarily help , since large positive @xmath33 also reduces acceptance . in the effective potential picture , increasing @xmath9 increases the depth of the potential , but increasing either @xmath33 or @xmath32 decreases the depth .",
    "we are only free to choose two of the three parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath33 , @xmath32 .",
    "what values should we choose to optimize the acceptance ?",
    "we will look at some examples for particular values of the operating parameters , @xmath388 and @xmath389 .     for an ag guide with a two - rod geometry , in the case of a linear stark shift .",

    "this is the easiest case to consider since there is only one free parameter , @xmath9 , determined by the the ratio of the rod radius , @xmath391 , to the gap between the rods , @xmath392 : @xmath393 and @xmath394 .",
    "the two nonlinear coupling coefficients are therefore @xmath395 and @xmath396 when the stark shift is linear , and @xmath397 , @xmath398 when the stark shift is quadratic .",
    "the calculation is hugely simplified by @xmath32 being negative because we know that the acceptance is insensitive to @xmath32 when it is negative , and we have an approximate analytical expression to describe the effect of the cubic nonlinearity .",

    "is increased from zero the acceptance first increases linearly , just as expected from the theory when the nonlinearities are neglected . however , as @xmath9 increases further , the growing cubic nonlinearity halts and then reverses the ascent of the acceptance , which reaches its maximum value near @xmath401 .",
    "we note that the rod radius needs to be @xmath402 to obtain this value of @xmath9 .",

    "we will examine this value in the context of some typical experiments at the end of the paper .",
    "the round points in the same figure show the results of numerical calculations of the transverse acceptance using the effective potential approach .",
    "our analytical result agrees very well with these numerical calculations .",
    "the square points show the results obtained from a full numerical calculation , including the micromotion . as in previous examples ,",
    "the inclusion of the micromotion increases the acceptance , but the overall shape of the plot remains unchanged , and the maximum of the acceptance still occurs close to the same value of @xmath9 .",
    "we have shown the result for a gapless guide operated at @xmath119 which is close to the optimal lens length ( see figure [ fig : linacc ] ) .",
    "results for other cases are just as easily obtained using the same procedure . in general , the optimal value of @xmath9 increases as @xmath93 is increased towards the edge of stability .",
    "figure [ fig:2rodva3](b ) provides the same information for a guide with gap lengths equal to the lens lengths .",

    "we will concentrate on the example of a gapless guide operated with @xmath119 . then",
    ", there are no new calculations to do since all the information we need is already given in figure [ fig : bothterms ] . for each value of @xmath9 and @xmath33",

    "we present the results , for both linear and quadratic stark shifts , in figure [ fig : generalva3 ] .",
    "let us concentrate first on the linear case , part ( a ) of the figure .",
    "we know from figure [ fig : cubic ] that negative values of @xmath33 increase the acceptance above the value given by the linear theory , and it is tempting to conclude that we should design the guide with negative @xmath33",
    ". however , negative @xmath33 implies large positive values for @xmath32 which greatly reduces the acceptance . as a result",
    ", the optimal acceptance is small and occurs for small values of @xmath9 , as illustrated by the results for @xmath406 shown in figure [ fig : generalva3](a ) .",
    "the figure shows that increasing the value of @xmath33 increases the maximum acceptance , and also the optimal value of @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the beneficial effect of a smaller @xmath32 outweighs the detrimental effect of a larger @xmath33 .",
    "the acceptance reaches its maximum value of @xmath407 when @xmath408 and @xmath409 . at this point",
    ", @xmath32 is very close to zero . for values of @xmath9 below the optimum",
    ", @xmath32 is negative and so has very little influence on the acceptance , which consequently increases rather linearly with @xmath9 .",
    "as soon as @xmath32 becomes positive further increases in @xmath9 only reduce the acceptance because of the associated increases in @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath410 , the same trends are seen - the acceptance increases linearly with @xmath9 up to the point where @xmath32 is zero , and then decreases . because increasing @xmath33 reduces the acceptance , the slope of this linear rise is smaller than before , the acceptance is maximized at higher values of @xmath9 , and this maximum value is reduced . for comparison",
    ", the result obtained in the absence of nonlinearities is shown by the solid line in the figure .",
    "the results for a quadratic stark shift are shown in figure [ fig : generalva3](b ) .",
    "the figure shows exactly the same characteristics as for the linear stark shift , but with all features occurring at lower values of @xmath9 .",
    "the acceptance obtains its maximum value when @xmath408 and @xmath411 . as before ,",
    "@xmath412 at this point , and this is also true of the turning points for higher values of @xmath33 .",
    "the maximum acceptance is @xmath413 , about half the value obtained for the linear stark shift .",
    "the recipe for designing an ag guide should now be clear - find an electrode structure that produces a small positive value of @xmath33 ( close to 0.075 ) , and a @xmath32 very close to zero , and choose lens lengths such that @xmath93 is close to 1 . if there is a need for gaps between the lenses , such as in an ag decelerator , it is best to keep the gaps short , in which case the above conclusions are not much altered .",
    "in this paper we have shown how nonlinear forces alter the trajectories of neutral particles in an ag guide , and have shown how to calculate the phase space acceptance of guides with these nonlinear forces included .",
    "we have found how to design the guide so that the acceptance is optimized . to conclude",
    ", we apply our results to some example experiments , revisiting those discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : linearpsa ] .    consider a beam of caf molecules entering an ag guide with a forward speed of 350 m/s .",
    "the guide has @xmath123 mm , @xmath414kv / cm , @xmath119 and @xmath361 , and the electrode geometry is designed so that @xmath9 and @xmath33 have optimal values , as in figure [ fig : generalva3 ] .",
    "the stark shift will be linear in this case , and the ratio of the stark shift at the centre of the guide to the forward kinetic energy is @xmath415 .",
    "the transverse acceptance will be approximately @xmath416 .",
    "the equivalent trap depth of this guide is approximately 30mk .",
    "the available acceptance is well matched to the phase space area occupied by the beam in a typical supersonic beam experiment where the molecules pass through a small skimmer before entering the guide .",
    "we can therefore expect the guide to transmit a large fraction of the total beam . for a second example we consider li atoms launched with a speed of 10 m/s from a mot , into an ag guide .",
    "the guide has the same parameters as above , except that @xmath9 is halved so that the acceptance is optimized for the quadratic stark shift . in this case @xmath417 , and the transverse acceptance is approximately @xmath418 . the equivalent trap depth of the guide is approximately 50@xmath17k , similar to the temperature of the atoms in the mot .",
    "again , we can expect the guide to transport a large fraction of the atoms .",
    "unless the length of the guide is shorter than the macromotion wavelength , in which case the transmission will be larger than the above estimates , the acceptance does not depend on the length .",
    "the guide can be made arbitrarily long , delivering atoms and molecules to an experiment far removed from the source .",
