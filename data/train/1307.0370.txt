    "looking at the diverging uniform ( @xmath210 ) susceptibility @xmath6 as @xmath14 ( fig .  [ chi ] ) intuitively suggests large low@xmath30 response and in turn increasing contribution of @xmath211 to the spin relaxation rate @xmath29 as @xmath14 .",
    "this is not what is observed , since we see no increase of @xmath94 ( fig .",
    "4b in the main text ) as @xmath14 , but instead @xmath94 decreases with decreasing @xmath2 , which is in agreement also with experimental data ( ref .",

    "this shows that @xmath118 goes to 0 as @xmath14 and is not diverging , rather its slow logarithmic approach to @xmath216 ( in contrast to linear in @xmath2 decrease for homogeneous system ) .",
    "this is in agreement with results in fig .  15 in ref",
    ".  @xcite , which show that @xmath115 at @xmath139 goes to 0 as @xmath63 and is only slightly increased by randomness for @xmath217 .",
    "another remarkable property of rhc can be seen in the difference between dynamic ( @xmath218 ) properties , e.g. @xmath219 , and strictly @xmath114 contribution .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ s_fig_sqw ] , which shows that @xmath220 is singular at @xmath114 since it consists besides the continuous background ( regular part ) also of a distinct delta peak at @xmath114 ( see fig .",
    "[ s_fig_sqw]b ) .",
    "this peak is non  dispersive and is the signature of non  ergodicity in the random system ( absence of diffusion ) at least for low@xmath2 .",

    "[ s_fig_sqw]c and also section above ) .",
    "distinction between strictly @xmath114 and @xmath221 properties can be traced back to the difference between diagonal elements , e.g. @xmath222 determining @xmath5 with only total spin @xmath223 ( triplet ) states contributing , and non  diagonal elements describing the transitions between , e.g. singlet and triplet states , which are relevant for dynamical ( @xmath221 ) properties .     for @xmath224 and @xmath225 showing much larger weight at low@xmath15 at @xmath226 .",

    "to show this , we present @xmath220 in fig .",
    "[ s_fig_sqw ] , where it is evident that the main contribution at @xmath229 comes from @xmath226 .",
    "this stays valid even in the low@xmath2 regime , where @xmath6 is already increased due to renormalization of @xmath3-s as observed in the rg flow .",
    "randomness does in fact slightly reduces the contribution of @xmath230 and slightly increases the contribution of @xmath217 , but the transfer of weight is much too small to make @xmath217 dominant .",
    "this is in agreement with finding for @xmath115 shown in fig .  15 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where even for very large randomness and @xmath139 the main contribution stays at @xmath226 similarly to the homogeneous system @xcite",
    ". it also agrees with experimental observation and direct statement of the authors @xcite , that there in no indication of important @xmath217 contributions as , e.g. , the d.c . field dependence of @xmath29 , being indication of the absence of ( anomalous ) low@xmath30 ( diffusion ) contribution .",
    "our analysis of local @xmath18 was based on assumption that there is no singular contribution emerging from long ",
    "wavelength @xmath199 physics .",
    "indeed , all our available data for @xmath231 for afm rhc confirm that the dominant regime at low@xmath2 is @xmath34 .",
    "still , @xmath199 regime needs further attention since it can lead at @xmath232 to a divergent @xmath233 either from the propagation ( prevented by randomness in the rhc ) in the homogeneous xx chain @xcite ( with @xmath234 ) or even more as the consequence of the spin diffusion @xcite ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "the latter can be realized at @xmath12 but vanishes at @xmath84 within the rhc @xcite .",
    "our results so far indicate that in spite of possible @xmath12 diffusion its contribution to @xmath8 is unresolvable for reachable systems , as follows also from nmr experiments @xcite where it can be directly tested via the magnetic field dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "concrete realization of a random system in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , has binary disorder distribution with two exchange couplings , @xmath236 $ ] and @xmath237 $ ] , which is in contrast with our continuous disorder distribution model , motivated by a usual theoretical reference .",
    "therefore the question arises , how different are the results for the binary distribution from our results . here",
    "we argue that the results are qualitatively and even quantitatively very similar for both distributions .",
    "this was realized already by j.  e.  hirsch @xcite , who showed that arbitrary disorder distribution lead to the similar low@xmath2 behaviour .",
    "axis is not rescaled and both distributions would therefore give almost the same @xmath94 .",
    "plots are for @xmath41 , @xmath238 and obtained with @xmath239 realizations . ]    to demonstrate the effect of binary distribution we show in fig .",
    "[ s_fig_bin ] the comparison of relaxation rate cdf - s for continuous disorder distribution with the ones for binary disorder distribution with the same effective width .",
    "it is seen that the difference is small and largest for strongest disorder , where it still remains only quantitative , while for low disorder cdf - s are essentially the same for both disorder distributions .",
    "therefore our results obtained with continuous distribution can easily be compared with measurements and they indeed agree qualitatively and to some extend even quantitatively with them ( see main text ) .",
    "using phenomenological stretched exponential form to fit experimental data on magnetization relaxation seems to be a common practice , which can be attributed to the fact that stretched exponential form can capture anomalously long tails in the distribution of the relaxation rates ( normal distribution can not ) and is at the same time very convenient for the fitting procedure .",
    "this immediately raises the question , how good this form really is for the description of experimental data and can it be motivated by some microscopic picture , e.g. model hamiltonian .    in fig .",
    "[ s_fig_pdf ] we show our rhc model results for relaxation time distributions ( pdf - s ) , which shows several important features when compared to the experimentally suggested stretched exponential forms ( see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "first one can see that the @xmath2 evolution is similar to the experimental one and more importantly at low@xmath2 anomalously long tails ( or large spread ) in pdf appear , which can be captured with stretched exponential form and not with , e.g. , normal ( gaussian ) distribution .",
    "this could be the reason for the success of the stretched exponential form in the fitting procedures and its phenomenological description of experimental data .    ) for several temperatures and one randomness @xmath240 .",
    "these results should be compared with the shape of experimental ones in fig .  4 in ref .",
    "temperature evolution of the distribution agrees with the experiment , as well as appearance of anomalously long tails of the distribution at low@xmath2 .",
    "points correspond to fitted @xmath89 which shows similar @xmath2dependence as experiment , while dashed vertical line corresponds to homogeneous ( @xmath51 ) model . ]",
    "however , the description of our rhc model results with stretched exponential is not perfect as can be expected , and the most obvious deviations can be found in the long tails .",
    "e.g. , for few specific value of @xmath88 analytical form of pdf - s is know @xcite and for @xmath241 has a form @xmath242}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\tau_0s^3}}\\,.\\label{pdfan}\\ ] ] on fig .",
    "[ s_fig_sea ] we compare our numerical result with @xmath243 ( for @xmath225 and @xmath68 ) with stretched exponential cdf obtained from eq .  ,",
    "@xmath244 $ ] .",
    "we observe that the rhc model predicts longer ( shorter ) tails in the pdf for smaller ( larger ) @xmath18 than stretched exponential form .",
    "this is in turn reflected in the corresponding time dependent magnetization relaxation function ( being laplace transform of pdf ) directly probed by experiment .",
    "one could , for example , from our pdf - s propose a new form ( instead of stretched exponential ) by approximating pdf - s with some function and performing its laplace transform .",
    "this is however not trivial and we leave it as a motivation for future work . in this way",
    "obtained form is expected to describe experimental data better than stretched exponential , although differences might be small and experimental data with higher resolution might be needed .",

    "<S> we stress that randomness of @xmath21 reduces the truncation error since some larger values of @xmath21 induce strong tension for formation of a local singlet and therefore in turn reduces the entanglement on larger distances . </S>",
