    "dusty plasmas ( dp ) have recently attracted a great deal of attention due to a variety of new phenomena observed in them and the novel physical mechanisms involved in their description @xcite . in addition to known plasma electrostatic waves @xcite , e.g. ion - acoustic waves ( iaw ) , new oscillatory modes arise in dp @xcite , among which the _ dust - ion acoustic wave _ ( diaw ) , essentially corresponding to ion - acoustic ( ia ) oscillations in a strong presence of dust .",

    "@xcite . for @xmath191 ,",
    "one recovers the _ dark _ soliton presented above .",
    "an important qualitative result to be retained is that the envelope soliton width @xmath27 and maximum amplitude @xmath173 satisfy @xmath192 ( see above ) , and thus depend on ( the ratio of ) the coefficients @xmath151 and @xmath153 ; for instance , regions with higher values of @xmath151 ( or lower values of @xmath153 ) will support wider ( spatially more extended ) localized excitations , for a given value of the maximum amplitude .",

    "[ figure2 ] we have depicted the behaviour of @xmath195 as a function of the wavenumber @xmath145 and the parameter @xmath109 : higher values of @xmath109 correspond to lower curves .",
    "remember that , for any given wavenumber @xmath145 , the dust concentration ( expressed via the value of @xmath109 ) determines the soliton width @xmath27 ( for a given amplitude @xmath173 ; see discussion above ) since @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , we see that the addition of _ negative _ dust generally ( @xmath197 ) results to higher values of @xmath195 ( i.e. wider or higher solitons ) , while _ positive _ dust ( @xmath53 ) has the opposite effect : it reduces the value of @xmath195 ( leading to narrower or shorter solitons ) . in a rather general manner , bright type solitons ( pulses )",
