    "<S> frequency conversion process is studied in a medium of atoms with a @xmath0 configuration of levels , where transition between two lower states is driven by a microwave field . in this system </S>",
    "<S> , conversion efficiency can be very high by virtue of the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) . depending on intensity of the microwave field , </S>",
    "<S> two regimes of eit are realized :  dark - state  </S>",
    "<S> eit for the weak field , and autler - townes - type eit for the strong one . </S>",
    "<S> we study both cases via analytical and numerical solution and find optimum conditions for the conversion .    </S>",
    "<S> frequency conversion is a useful technique for generation of coherent tunable radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> efficient conversion of a continuous - wave ( c.w . ) </S>",
    "<S> radiation at relatively low pump intensities requires high nonlinear optical susceptibility of an ( atomic ) medium , which can be achieved by tuning to resonances . </S>",
    "<S> however , this will also increase the medium absorption and refraction seriously limiting the conversion efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently proposed @xcite and demonstrated in many experiments that this problem can be overcome if one uses the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the uv radiation has been generated by use of dc electric - field coupling in atomic hydrogen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> radiation fields have been used to produce transparency in experiments on red to blue frequency conversion with molecular sodium @xcite , and on enhanced four - wave mixing with doped crystals @xcite . recently , blue to uv @xcite and uv to vuv @xcite conversion in atomic pb vapor have been reached with almost unity photon - conversion efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> eit is due to quantum interference in multilevel quantum systems ( atoms , molecules , dopants in solids ) induced by applied electromagnetic radiation . </S>",
    "<S> there are two basic mechanisms responsible for eit . </S>",
    "<S> the first one occurs at large strength of one ,  coupling  , electromagnetic field which mixes and splits quantum states ( autler - townes effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> when another , weaker  probe  </S>",
    "<S> field is tuned in between the two mixed states , it experiences no absorption not only because of the splitting but also due to interference between excitation paths to two mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism works well even in the case when the states mixed by the coupling field decay spontaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the second mechanism takes place at comparable intensities of applied fields . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the cancellation of absorption and refraction can be explained by creation of a coherent superposition of atomic states (  dark  state ) not excited by the radiation , and by preparation of atoms in this superposition ( which is termed coherent population trapping - cpt ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dark state should be stable in order to allow for the population trapping . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dark state should be a superposition of the metastable atomic states .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper we consider the frequency conversion in a scheme where both mechanisms of eit are possible . </S>",
    "<S> this is a three - level @xmath1 system ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the dipole - allowed optical transitions , and the microwave ( m.w . ) </S>",
    "<S> transition @xmath4 is a magnetic - dipole one . </S>",
    "<S> such systems can be realized , e.g. , on d - lines in alkali atoms , and may also be found in some molecules and doped crystals as well . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on the absorption reduction induced by the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field have recently been performed with similar systems in solids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is interesting , above all , because it allows easy control of the frequency conversion process by intensity of the microwave field . </S>",
    "<S> possible applications of the present system include generation of the optical field which is phase- and amplitude - correlated to the input field , optical phase conjugation @xcite , generation of squeezed light @xcite , as well as quantum noise suppression and quantum correlation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when one of the optical fields ( let say , @xmath5 ) and the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field @xmath6 are applied to the @xmath1 atom , they induce an optical susceptibility on transition @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the generation of the optical field with frequency @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , this field as well as the field @xmath5 will be quickly absorbed if they are tuned close to the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> however , the absorption can be substantially reduced for particular values of the microwave intensity . for the weak m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field , optical waves create the dark state which is only slightly disturbed . </S>",
    "<S> the strong m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field mixes and splits both ground states @xmath9 and @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> so that relatively weak optical fields experience eit of the autler - townes type . here we consider both cases , treating an interaction of the e.m . </S>",
    "<S> radiation with atoms as well as the propagation of radiation through the medium in exact manner .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical waves propagation along the @xmath11axis in the medium is described by the maxwell equations . in the slowly varying amplitude and phase approximation , and in continuous - wave limit these equations can be reduced to the following form @xcite :    [ maxw5 ] @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the dimensionless optical field amplitudes ( rabi frequencies ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 are the optical amplitudes and phases , respectively ; @xmath17 is the spontaneous decay rate in a channel @xmath18 , and @xmath19 *  * in the basis of atomic states @xmath20 . </S>",

( [ maxw5 ] ) ) are determined by the ( steady - state ) density matrix elements @xmath24 averaged over the atomic velocities with the distribution @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath27-projection of the atom velocity : @xmath28 , with @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the atomic density matrix . </S>",

    "<S> field phase @xmath33 and the phase @xmath34 of the atomic dipole moment @xmath35 : @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> presence of the field on @xmath42 transition and/or both optical fields means , corresponding to the maxwell equations , that the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> wave should also change along the propagation path . </S>",
    "<S> the eit - assisted generation of a microwave radiation has recently been observed in atomic cs vapor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we , however , will not consider this effect here since the changes are of the order of @xmath43 at the most @xcite which is negligible in the present context . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the propagation direction of the m.w . wave ( traveling or standing one in a m.w . </S>",
    "<S> cavity ) can be chosen perpendicular to the @xmath11axis .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the case when all three e.m . </S>",
    "<S> fields are in resonance with corresponding transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this situation can be studied analytically if we additionally suppose equal spontaneous relaxation rates @xmath44 @xmath45 , zero relaxation rate of the coherence between states @xmath9 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 , and zero atomic velocity @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ ims]-[ro3 ] ) , that the medium is absolutely transparent and not refractive for @xmath57 and @xmath58 these are exactly the conditions for the dark state in closed @xmath1 system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for arbitrary optical field amplitudes and phases , however , the refraction and absorption ( or amplification ) of individual frequency components can be substantial . here </S>",

    "<S> energy . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the total energy flow is proportional to intensity @xmath60 of the optical waves . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity is expressed in terms of rabi frequency as @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 , where the last equality follows from the steady - state density matrix equations @xcite . thus , we arrive at almost obvious conclusion that the dissipation of the e.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy is small when the excited state population is small : @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the expression ( [ ro3 ] ) shows that , for arbitrary @xmath66 and @xmath53 , this is the case for two ranges of the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> rabi frequency : @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> these values correspond to eit of the cpt - type and the autler - townes - type , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the change of the fields can be calculated analytically in present situation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of the resonant case is that the phase equation can be solved for arbitrary values of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation equation for the relative phase is as follows ( if we neglect the change of the m.w . </S>",

    "<S> field , @xmath80 , the density matrix elements to the second order in @xmath69 are :    [ ims-1 ] @xmath81 for generation of the field @xmath82 the dissipation of total optical energy is proportional to ( taking into account eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cos0 ] ) ) :    @xmath83 which has a solution @xmath84 at sufficiently small optical length @xmath85 , the total intensity decays linearly : @xmath86 . if we neglect this slow decay ( which would simply correspond to neglect of terms of the second order in @xmath87 ) , we obtain the following amplitude equations @xmath88 which can be easily solved :    [ sol1 ] @xmath89 the solution indicates that the e.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy is transferred back and forth between two optical waves as the optical length increases . </S>",
    "<S> the period of these oscillations is @xmath90 , which is much smaller than the characteristic length of the total energy dissipation : @xmath91 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diss1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , very efficient conversion takes place at    @xmath92    the loss of the optical intensity is @xmath93 at this point .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason for such an efficient process is a preparation of the medium in almost dark state . if the e.m . </S>",
    "<S> field between the states @xmath94 and @xmath46 is not applied then the dark state in @xmath1 system takes the form @xcite : @xmath95 the population of the dark state can be expressed in terms of the ground - state density matrix elements : @xmath96 which are , to the first order in @xmath69 , @xmath97 thus , the population of the dark superposition is @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that a large lower - level coherence is not established in advance ( since @xmath77 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as soon as @xmath99 is generated , the coherence emerges , and the medium is prepared in the nonabsorbing state .    </S>",
    "<S> even in real situation , when both the relaxation rate @xmath100 of the coherence between states @xmath9 and @xmath101 and the doppler broadening are present , the parameters of the process are in fairly good agreement with calculations presented above . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> we see that dynamics of the intensities and the phase does not change qualitatively as compared to the case of negligible decay of the dark state . the behavior of the phase @xmath53 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) follows the law @xmath111 obtained analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the jumps in the phase occur at points where the intensity of the field being absorbed approaches zero , according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxw5 ] ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 wave is generated and reaches its maximum at the length @xmath112 ( this corresponds to the real length of the gas cell of @xmath113 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is quite close to that calculated from analytical results , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ zmax1 ] ) , @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum intensity of the @xmath82 wave is @xmath115 which is slightly below the value @xmath116 calculated from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diss1 ] ) because of an additional dissipation due to decay of the dark state with the rate @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this rate must be sufficiently small in order to allow for the population trapping in @xmath117 , namely it must be much smaller than the optical pumping rate into the dark state : @xmath118 here , detuning @xmath119 includes the doppler shift : @xmath120 , where @xmath121 are the laser frequency detunings from transitions @xmath122 , @xmath123 is the eigenenergy of the atomic state @xmath124 . for the resonance @xmath125 and large doppler </S>",
    "<S> broadening @xmath126 , condition ( [ g - cond ] ) reduces to @xmath127 the better this condition is satisfied , the higher the efficiency of frequency conversion is . </S>",
    "<S> the rate @xmath100 is determined by m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field fluctuations , atomic collisions and other random phase disturbing processes . for parameters of the proposed here experiment </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath100 can be very small . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the rate @xmath128 has been observed in experiment @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> inasmuch as cpt is a basis for the considered above scheme , the generation occurs under quite restrictive conditions on e.m . </S>",
    "<S> wave frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that cpt takes place when the optical frequencies are in the narrow range (  black line  ) around two - photon resonance @xcite : @xmath129 considering that the wave @xmath130 is always generated at frequency @xmath131 ( simply due to photon energy conservation ) , the condition ( [ 2ph - cond ] ) tells us that the generation takes place only if the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field frequency is in the narrow range around resonance with transition @xmath42 : @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 demonstrates this fact . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the generation peak ( width of the black line ) is determined by the pumping rate into the dark state @xcite . in the presence of large doppler broadening this width is of the order of @xmath133 @xmath134 , which is a few khz for parameters of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that , at the same time , the large doppler broadening allows for a broad tuning of the generated wave . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we have plotted dependence of the generated intensity on detuning @xmath135 ( for fixed @xmath136 ) at the optical length @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that conversion efficiency remains fairly large for detunings of the order of the doppler broadening ( few ghz for na vapor ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the cpt survives even at large common detunings @xmath137 as long as the condition ( [ g - cond ] ) is satisfied .    </S>",
    "<S> the second mechanism of eit allowing efficient frequency conversion in the @xmath138 medium takes place at strong m.w . </S>",
    "<S> fields , @xmath68 . in this case , the absorption coefficients to the second order in @xmath139 are :    [ ims-2 ] @xmath140 the energy dissipation is determined by the equation    @xmath141 with a solution @xmath142 again , if we neglect the slow total energy dissipation ( i.e. , we neglect terms of the second order in @xmath69 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ims-2 ] ) ) , we obtain the solution of amplitude equations , very similar to the cpt case :    [ sol2 ] @xmath143 here , the period of intensity oscillations is @xmath144 , which is again much smaller than the characteristic length of the total energy dissipation : @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> maximum energy transfer to the @xmath82 field occurs at    @xmath146    the loss of the optical intensity is @xmath147 at this point .    </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations of the optical waves propagation give the results which are in very good agreement with analytical ones , and which are qualitatively very similar to the cpt - case in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the physical mechanism is , however , different . </S>",
    "<S> as we have discussed above , cpt does not work at strong m.w . </S>",
    "<S> fields except under the specific conditions ( [ phi - cond ] ) and ( [ g - cond ] ) . this can be proved by considering the density matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that for this case the ground state populations are equal to @xmath148 up to the second order in @xmath139 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the atomic population is , for arbitrary @xmath151 and @xmath53 , not all pumped into the dark state : @xmath152 . under the condition ( [ cos0 ] ) taking place at the generation , the ground - state coherence @xmath153 is negligibly small and @xmath154 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , a very weak optical absorption at strong m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field is due to the autler - townes effect , or , in other terms , due to the capture of almost all atomic population by strong m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field in two - level system @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism requires large m.w . </S>",
    "<S> intensities , but it has some advantages over the cpt - case . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it is more robust . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the relaxation @xmath100 does not play so important role , and the generation range of m.w . </S>",
    "<S> frequency @xmath156 is much broader ( it is of order of @xmath69 ) as compared to the case of weak m.w </S>",
    "<S> . field . similar to the case with a weak m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field , there is a possibility to tune the generated radiation over the doppler contour , and here the tuning is not as sensitive to the value of @xmath100 as in former case . </S>",
    "<S> note that here the optical length scales are determined only by @xmath69 and do not depend on the input intensity , @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the maximum conversion takes place at the same length for different input intensities . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially important for experiments with nonuniform light beams , e.g. , with the gaussian intensity profile . </S>",
    "<S> another important advantage is that this mechanism can be applied not only to @xmath1-system , but also to a v - scheme with one ground and two excited states . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the optical frequency conversion may be observed experimentally , for example , in a v - system of @xmath158 solid where the reduced absorption was recently demonstrated @xcite .    finally , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 represents the dependence of generated wave on rabi frequency @xmath69 of the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field at fixed optical length @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure clearly demonstrates two ranges of @xmath69 where eit and , correspondingly , efficient frequency conversion occur .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have described a scheme for efficient optical conversion based on eit in atomic @xmath1 system where the interaction loop is closed by a microwave field . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> intensity , two mechanisms of eit work in this scheme : cpt and autler - townes effects . </S>",
    "<S> intensity of the m.w . </S>",
    "<S> field plays also a role of controlling parameter in the conversion process - it determines optical length scales of the process , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ zmax1 ] ) , ( [ zmax2 ] ) , as well as the degree of the total energy dissipation , cf . eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ diss1 ] ) , ( [ diss2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> an optimal choice is always possible , which should allow an experimental realization of the proposed scheme in different systems . </S>",
    "<S> since the eit - assisted frequency conversion combines large nonlinearity with substantially reduced spontaneous emission noise , one may expect that the generated signal will be fluctuation - correlated with the pump wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such correlations persist even on a quantum level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the present scheme can be used for generation of two phase - correlated optical waves , which would be an alternative to conventional methods using electro- or acousto - optical modulators , or direct current modulation in laser diodes . </S>",
    "<S> another possible application may be a generation of squeezed light @xcite . </S>"
