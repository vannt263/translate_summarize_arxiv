    "the goal of this note is to provide a mathematical derivation of the fractional diffusion equation @xmath0 in view of some recent experiments on the purkinje cells ( and , in general , on neural structures ) , which seem to exhibit this type of nonlocal diffusion . in equation  ,",
    "the function  @xmath1 plays the role of a diffusive substance ( the concrete substance depending on the particular type of diffusion considered in different specific situations ) , @xmath2 is an adimensional normalization constant , and @xmath3 and  @xmath4 are fixed quantities ( representing , respectively , the velocity of propagation of an elementary signal and the length of the propagation device ) .",
    "moreover , the notation  @xmath5 stands for a time fractional derivative , that , for definiteness , we take here in the sense of caputo .",
    "namely , we recall the notion of caputo fractional derivative of order  @xmath6 ( see  @xcite ) , i.e. we set @xmath7 where  @xmath8 is the euler s gamma - function ( which , for a fixed  @xmath6 , also plays in   just the role of a normalizing factor ) .    equations such as   have recently appeared in connection to several experimental data and theoretical considerations related to the diffusion in the purkinje cells : compare , in particular , formula   here with the first formula in display in  @xcite and see also  @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the scientific literature has presented several deep and interesting descriptions of the time fractional diffusion in   also in connection with neuronal biology , see e.g. the discussion related to formulas  ( 8.3 ) , ( 8.12 ) and  ( 8.13 ) in  @xcite , but no attempt has been made till now to _ derive equation   from `` basic principles '' _ in a ( possibly highly simplified ) toy - model somehow related to neurons .",
    "our goal in this paper is to try to fill this gap in the literature , since we believe that derivations from basic principles and from simpler equations have several cultural and pratical benefits , such as clarifying a difficult but important research subject , enlarging the community of researchers working on a field , providing connections with different subjects and leading to a deeper and broader understanding of the phenomena .",
    "of course , in this type of derivation processes some dramatic simplification has sometimes to be expected , in order to reduce the arguments to the core whenever possible , and , in this sense , the situation that we present in this paper should not be intended as a `` full explanation '' of the functioning of the complex neural networks , but only as a simplified ( though , in our opinion , sufficiently `` realistic '' and with concrete scientific value ) model , related to , or at least inspired by , a simplified version of neural network .    also , differently from the classical literature , our aim is not to relate fractional diffusion with the standard one ( which is formally obtained in the limit as  @xmath9 ) , but rather to see fractional diffusion as a superposition of hyperbolic equations with a delay . in our setting , such delay is caused by the ramification of the mathematical structure on which the hyperbolic equation takes place .",
    "the construction of this ramified medium is inspired by the structure of the purkinje cells , which are a class of neurons located in the cerebellum , with a highly ramified structure , whose activity is of crucial importance for the coordination of complex motions .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the malfunctioning of the purkinje cells may lead ( among other symptoms ) to ataxia ( i.e. , lack of voluntary coordination ) , tremors and hyperreactivity , see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein .    thus , one of the roles of the ramified structure of the purkinje cells seems to be that of somehow `` smoothing out '' sharp impulses .",
    "a mathematical counterpart of this phenomenon can be seen by comparing the smoothing effects of the heat equation with the shocks typical of hyperbolic equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we provide a toy - model in which the fractional diffusion in   comes from the superposition of travelling waves . in a sense ,",
    "the highly ramified structure of the diffusion device ( in the appropriate space / time scale limit of finely ramified patterns and high velocity of the travelling wave ) provides , at the end of the structure , an averaged superposition of travelling waves with a nonlinear delay which , in turn , transforms the hyperbolic equation of a single travelling wave into a nonlocal diffusion of the averaged function as in  , thus providing a regularizing effect on the solution .",
    "this construction suggests the possibility that the fractional diffusion experimentally found in neurons could be related to the possibility of smoothing irregular signals , so to make the coordination of the movements less subject to shocks and discontinuities . in this sense , it is intriguing to wonder whether the regularizing effects of fractional parabolic equations ( when compared to hyperbolic equations ) could be seen as a mathematical counterpart of an evolutionary advantage of the high ramification of the purkinje cells , with the benefit of smoothing the transmission of the signals and perhaps favoring , at least indirectly , a general coordination of the organism .",
    "roughly speaking , the mathematical effect of highly ramified arbors in the transmission of signals may be thought as producing selected and appropriate delays in the signal transmission : these delays in turn `` average '' the signal by producing a situation similar to those of fractional diffusion .",
    "rather than just worsen the transmission of signals with a retardation , this finely tuned delay procedure might somehow contribute to coordination , since the regularizing features of fractional parabolic equations smooth out the data ( differently from the case of standard transmissions through hyperbolic equations ) .    in our analysis ,",
    "the mathematical methods exploited are all of elementary nature ( integration by parts , change of variable , superposition principle , integration theory , basic pde ) , all the ansatz and approximation assumptions are clearly stated step by step , the biological motivations are explained without assuming major prerequisites and providing quite exhaustive lists of classical and contemporary references , and we also indulge in explanations and clarifications , therefore the paper is _ easily usable by a wide group of interested researchers_. our goal here is not to give a complete explanation of the rich phenomena encoded by the complex structure of the purkinje cells ; nevertheless , we believe that the mathematical approach that we present here is useful to better understand some specific neuronal features . moreover , the new connection between fractional diffusion and hyperbolic equations may lead to a better understanding of the smoothing effects for travelling signals that are favored by the highly ramified neuronal structures .    furthermore , though a clear understanding of the time fractional diffusion in real world phenomena will require combined efforts from different perspectives ( e.g. with synergic approaches from biology , chemistry , physics , etc . ) , we hope that the mathematical insight presented here can better motivate the interest of fractional diffusion among the mathematical community , serve as a foundation ground for scientists with different background and suggest new connections between very different types of evolution equations , such as hyperbolic and ( fractional ) parabolic ones , which are made possible by the highly complex structures of the media . also , we believe that a mathematical model easy to handle may provide some initial insight ( to be enhanced by quantitative and more sophisticated studies ) about the level at which fractional diffusion arises in many natural phenomena , also trying to give information on the scales involved and on the basic causes of these features .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ kaj ]",
    "we recall some basic facts about the caputo derivative and the related time fractional diffusion .",
    "in particular , a simple integration by parts procedure , combined with an appropriate change of variables , relates the caputo derivative to the superpositions of delayed classical second derivatives .",
    "then , in section  [ tgsfd0202 ] , we will introduce a highly ramified mathematical structure , inspired by the neuronal spikes , and study the transmission of a hyperbolic travelling wave along such complex medium .",
    "we will see that the structure of the medium produces the superposition of delayed travelling waves which , at the end of the transmission device , in average and in the high speed limit , can be related to the fractional derivative and produce the time fractional diffusion equation in  .    in the computations needed for this scope ,",
    "an ancillary limit formula is stated , whose proof is given , for the facility of the reader , in section  [ stbd ] .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are then summarized in section  [ stbd:2 ] .",
    "the notion of fractional diffusion provides at the moment an intense topic of research , both for its very challenging theoretical difficulties and in view of concrete applications in biology , physics and finance ( see e.g.  @xcite for several explicit discussions and motivations ) . in general , fractional",
    "diffusion presents several phenomena in common with the classical diffusion arising from gaussian processes and brownian motions , such as the regularizing effects with respect to initial data : in this sense , see in particular  @xcite for a regularity theory in lebesgue spaces , and also  @xcite for a regularity theory in hlder spaces ( see also page  103 in  @xcite for a general discussion about the relation between `` abstract volterra equations '' and the time fractional diffusion ) . for higher regularity in time , see also section 5 of  @xcite , and for related results see  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , important and often unexpected differences between classical and fractional diffusion arise : for instance , solutions of fractional equations can locally approximate any given function , in sharp contrast with the classical case , see  @xcite .",
    "the monograph  @xcite also provides extensive and throughout discussions about fractional derivatives in time also in view of many applications .",
    "see also  @xcite for an approach to different types of time fractional derivatives from the perspectives of stochastic processes with long rest .    here , we recall some basic facts on the fractional caputo derivative in   and perform some preliminary computations which will be used in the forthcoming sections . to start with , for notational convenience ,",
    "we scale the constant in   and we integrate by parts , by obtaining that @xmath10 using the substitution  @xmath11 , we thus obtain @xmath12 where @xmath13 our goal is now to interpret   as a superposition of delayed effects caused by the ramified structure of the transmission medium , which is somehow inspired by the structure of the purkinje cells ( in neuronal transmissions , other types of delays leading to fractional diffusion may be caused by obstacles and bindings , see  @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we present a transmission media built by a highly ramified structure .",
    "such mathematical model is qualitatively inspired by the dendritic arbor of the purkinje cells .",
    "we will consider the transmission along this medium , as prescribed by the classical wave equation .",
    "the ramifications of the medium will cause the delay of some signals , whose superposition at the end of the structure will be related to the fractional derivative .    in this setting ,",
    "the superposition of travelling waves with high speed and a suitably tuned delay will produce a time fractional diffusion in the formal limit , thus providing a new bridge between equations of very different kind ( i.e. hyperbolic and fractional parabolic ) with the aim of encoding some of the features observed by the experiments in neuronal dendrites , such as the time fractional diffusion in the spikes of the purkinje cells .    in the classical transmission line analysis",
    "( see e.g. pages  514 in  @xcite ) the variation in space of the potential is related , via inductance , to the variation in time of the intensity of current ; on the other hand , the variation in space of the intensity of current is related , via capacitance , to the variation in time of the potential .",
    "the combination of these equations naturally lead to the wave equation ( for a derivation of the wave equation directly from maxwell s equations see e.g. ( 3.14 ) and  ( 3.15 ) in  @xcite ) . for models presenting wave equations in cylindrical neurons , see e.g. formulas  ( 6.20 ) and  ( 6.21 ) in  @xcite , and also  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the analysis of travelling waves in neurons is a classical and active topic of study in itself , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for other mathematical models related to diffusion in neurons based on monte carlo methods .",
    "the model of the ramified medium that we take into account is a very basic simplification inspired by a branch of the purkinje cell and goes as follows .",
    "we let  @xmath14 ( to be taken large in the sequel ) and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and  @xmath17 as in  .",
    "we let also @xmath18 we consider a set of  @xmath19 planar curves , with one common endpoint and the other endpoint lying on a common straight line .",
    "these curves will be denoted by  @xmath20 .",
    "the length of  @xmath21 is set to be  @xmath22 .",
    "the length of  @xmath23 is set to be  @xmath24 .",
    "iteratively , the length of  @xmath25 , for each  @xmath26 is set to be equal to @xmath27        see figure  [ ness ] for an exemplifying representation of such medium .",
    "of course , the reader may compare this picture and the classical drawing by s. ramon y cajal , see e.g. + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purkinje_cell#/media/file:purkinjecell.jpg , + as well as the many realistic pictures available nowadays , to appreciate the motivation related to the purkinje cell  though of course we do not aim to a full understanding of the purkinje cell by the very simplified model described here .",
    "we stress , in particular , that when we refer to concepts like `` horizontal '' , `` left '' or `` right '' we are clearly making no reference to concrete . in this case",
    ", the left end of figure  [ ness ] would act as a `` soma '' ( the cell body of a neuron ) , which is the site of final integration of the signals and ultimately is responsible to generate action potentials to send to downstream neurons . in our mathematical deduction",
    ", this situation can be also taken into account ( what counts is just the average delayed obtained by a signal travelling from one end of the transmission medium to the other ) . ]",
    "special directions in the cerebellum , but rather we are referring to the toy - model drawn in figure  [ ness ] : in any case , as it will be apparent in the computation , these directions play no role in our derivation , what counts is only the fact that the ramification produces branches of different lengths or , better to say , just the fact that the speed to travel to the end of a branch depends on the branch itself .",
    "also , figure  [ ness ] can be immersed in a more complicated neural network and we only focus on a `` single '' ramified system to keep the discussion as simple as possible ( in practice , of course , the response to an organism depends on the signal transmissions in many cells and not just one ) .",
    "see also  @xcite and the references therein for accurate descriptions of dendritic arbors .",
    "of course , different scalings and different parameters in the model presented lead to quantitatively different versions of fractional diffusions , which may be seen as the mathematical counterpart of the quantitative differences explored in  @xcite in view of the different densities of dendritic spines .",
    "see also  @xcite for an accurate analysis of anomalous diffusion in fractal media .",
    "of course , a detailed description of the geometry of the dendritic spines also in terms of density and statistics of the ramification may produce a better understanding of the neuronal diffusion and inspire quantitatively more accurate models .",
    "in addition , it would be very interesting to further investigate these questions and related problems in the light of the theory of wave propagation in networks ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein , where however dirichlet or control conditions are usually assumed on the vertices of the graphs , also in relation with vibrating strings with joined extrema ) .",
    "we will now take into account a travelling wave in the structure depicted in figure  [ ness ] , and compute the averaged effect of the delay induced by the ramification of the medium .    from the biological point of view",
    ", we think it is worth justifying our choice of considering hyperbolic equations as `` building blocks '' of our derivation procedure . indeed , some of the equations proposed to model neuronal diffusion , such as the hodgkin - huxley equation , are of parabolic , rather then hyperbolic type . nevertheless , we chose not to consider the hodgkin - huxley equation as the basis of our model , for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the hodgkin - huxley equation  @xcite is a rather complicated model and , at least from an `` aesthetic '' perspective , does not seem to be suitable as a `` basic principle '' from which one derives a time fractional process .",
    "more importantly , there are in the literature some non - thermodynamical theories that suggest ( and some experiments support ) that mechanical waves accompany action potentials , see  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that some reaction - diffusion processes can produce solitons and traveling waves , see  @xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", we thought it was intriguing , and also sufficiently realistic , to take the wave equation as the basic to deduce a time fractional equation in our simplified setting .",
    "thus , the idea is to consider a travelling wave ( say , from left to right ) in such medium , whose `` natural speed '' is given by  @xmath28 , that is a ( smooth ) function @xmath29 satisfying to be smooth , with a smoothness possibly depending on the length  @xmath4 of the transmission medium , but independent of the large parameters  @xmath19 and  @xmath3 .",
    "] @xmath30 and analyze ( for large  @xmath19 ) its effect on the right end of the structure , which we will denote by  @xmath1 .    in our toy - model ,",
    "the function  @xmath1 at the right end of the structure represents , somehow , the relevant information that the left end of the structure `` sends '' to the organism : in this sense , we think it is natural to consider such information at the right end of the structure as the superposition of the information sent in each of the branches which connect the left end to the right end . in view of this",
    ", we will see that  @xmath1 is the superposition of a series of  @xmath31 s , shifted by a nonlinear delay ( a precise formula will be given in   below )",
    ".    roughly speaking , the effect of any travelling function  @xmath31 on the right end of the structure may be seen as the superposition of the  @xmath32-contributions of @xmath31 along each of the ramifications  @xmath25 , for  @xmath33 .",
    "each of these contributions will be denoted by  @xmath34 .",
    "we drop the dependence on  @xmath35 for the sake of simplicity and we assume that  @xmath36 , namely the contributions are `` equally spread '' on the ramifications . also , we observe that the length travelled by the function  @xmath37 is equal to the one travelled by  @xmath38 ( which is in turn given by  @xmath4 ) plus the length of the additional quantity  @xmath39 .",
    "this causes a phase delay of  @xmath37 with respect to  @xmath38 of size  @xmath40 .",
    "hence @xmath41 iteratively , for each  @xmath26 , the length travelled by the function  @xmath34 is equal to the one travelled by  @xmath42 plus the length of the additional quantity  @xmath43 .",
    "this causes a phase delay of  @xmath34 with respect to  @xmath42 of size  @xmath44 .",
    "hence @xmath45 accordingly @xmath46 hence , the total contribution of a travelling function  @xmath31 on the right side of the structure is taken to be @xmath47 we set @xmath48 and we have that @xmath49 not to interrupt this calculation , we postpone the proof of   to section  [ stbd ] .",
    "now , in view of   and  , the total contribution of a smooth travelling function  @xmath31 on the right side of the structure becomes @xmath50\\\\   = \\ ; & \\frac{1}{n }   \\sum_{1{\\leqslant}k{\\leqslant}n }   f\\left(t - c^{-1}l\\,\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}\\right ) + o(c^{-1}\\,\\epsilon_n ) .",
