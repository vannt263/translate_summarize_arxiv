    "<S> we consider five dimensional desitter spacetimes with a deficit angle due to the presence of a closed 2-brane and identify one dimension as an extra dimension . from the four dimensional viewpoint </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the spacetime has a structure similar to a kaluza - klein bubble of nothing , that is , four dimensional spacetime ends at the 2-brane . </S>",
    "<S> since a spatial section of the full desitter spacetime has the topology of a sphere , the boundary surface surrounds the remaining four dimensional spacetime , and can be considered as the celestial sphere . after the spacetime is created from nothing via an instanton which we describe , some four dimensional observers in it see the celestial sphere falling down , and will be in contact with a @xmath0-brane attached on it .    </S>",
    "<S> * key word * : kaluza - klein bubble , de sitter spacetime    it is well known that the kaluza - klein vacuum is unstable against creation of bubbles of nothing in general  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first solution found by witten describes the kaluza - klein bubble in asymptotically flat spacetimes with a compactified space dimension . </S>",
    "<S> recently , extension to asymptotically ads spacetimes was considered from the aspect of the ads / cft correspondence or dynamical spacetimes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the regular , dynamical and non - trivial geometries might give us good examination for superstring theory . </S>",
    "<S> ( see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for similar solution in the context of the randall - sundrum brane world . ) on the other hand , a kaluza - klein bubble solution in de sitter spacetime has not been found .    </S>",
    "<S> consistent de sitter vacua in superstring theory were just recently found  @xcite and , thus , we now have all kinds of maximally symmetric spacetimes in superstring theory : minkowski , de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes . among these three types of spcetimes , </S>",
    "<S> a kaluza - klein bubble solution has not been found in and only in de sitter spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it seems natural to seek a kaluza - klein bubble solution in de sitter spacetime .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper can be considered as a first step towards this direction . while we shall not find a kaluza - klein bubble solution itself in de sitter spacetime , we examine properties of a spacetime with non - trivial topology , which has structures quite similar to those of a kaluza - klein bubble . </S>",
    "<S> first we shall discuss the five dimensional de sitter spacetime with a deficit angle due to the presence of a closed 2-brane and then find a spacetime structure similar to a kaluza - klein bubble . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the four dimensional spacetime ends at the 2-brane if we identify one dimension with an extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of full spacetime here is a straightforward extension of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in four dimension to five dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> non - trivial issue presented here is analysis from the four dimensional point of view .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the five dimensional desitter spacetime in the static chart @xmath1 through the double wick rotation @xmath2 we obtain a new metric @xmath3 where @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if we require the spacetime to be regular at @xmath5 , the coordinate @xmath6 must have the period @xmath7 . as seen later , the spacetime is exactly five dimensional desitter spacetime . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if we add a @xmath0-brane at @xmath5 then this condition is relaxed and the period can be any value smaller than this value : @xmath8 the equality holds if and only if the @xmath0-brane tension vanishes or there is no @xmath0-brane . in the following we consider a @xmath0-brane with non - zero tension at @xmath5 to make the period @xmath9 small enough and may regard @xmath6 as a coordinate of a compact dimension . again , as seen later , the spacetime is five dimensional desitter spacetime with a deficit angle .    for @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-dimensional subspace spanned by ( @xmath6 , @xmath11 ) and extended to the negative @xmath11 region is like an american football as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pancake ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( for @xmath12 it is a round sphere . ) at each point ( @xmath6 , @xmath11 ) on the surface of the football , a @xmath0-sphere with radius @xmath13 is attached and it is identified with the @xmath0-sphere at ( @xmath6 , @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if the longitudinal angular coordinate of each @xmath0-sphere is suppressed , a @xmath15 surface has a pancake - like ( or convex lens - like ) shape . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the pancake corresponds to the size of the compact dimension @xmath16 , and the edge of the pancake is at @xmath5 , where a @xmath0-brane with the topology of @xmath0-sphere is attached . while the thickness is independent of the time @xmath17 , the physical radius of the pancake changes as @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> -dimensional subspace spanned by ( @xmath6 , @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0-sphere is attached on each point and @xmath0-spheres at ( @xmath6 , @xmath19 ) are identified . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pancake ] ]    let us focus on the geometrical structure of timelike hypersurfaces @xmath20 where we live . </S>",
    "<S> the induced metric is @xmath21 the riemann tensor of the induced metric becomes @xmath22 since the induced metric has a constant curvature , the spacetime locally has maximal symmetry and is locally isometric to a four dimensional desitter ( @xmath23 ) spacetime . to investigate the global structure </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a new coordinate @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> then the induced metric is written as @xmath26 next we introduce the following coordinate @xmath27 via the coordinate transformation @xmath28 finally the induced metric becomes desitter one in the complete chart @xmath29    to see where @xmath30 chart covers the desitter spacetime , it is convenient to embed it in a five dimensional minkowski spacetime as @xmath31 the desitter metric is @xmath32 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , the @xmath15 slices are cross sections of the desitter hyperboloid @xmath33 with surfaces defined by @xmath34 the @xmath35 slices are the cross sections of the desitter hyperboloid with @xmath36 surfaces . hence , the coordinate system ( @xmath17 , @xmath11 ) covers the region @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the right boundary @xmath38 is just a coordinate artifact and the five dimensional spacetime can be analytically continued beyond it so that the four dimensional projection of the full five dimensional spacetime covers the region @xmath39 as well , where the desitter open chart is fitted . on the other hand , we can see that the five dimensional spacetime can not be extended beyond the other boundary @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the five dimensional spacetime is geodesically complete therefore , as depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , the regions @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent a similar one with the kaluza - klein bubble of nothing and the four dimensional world , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary @xmath40 ( or @xmath5 ) has the topology of a @xmath0-sphere and the area radius @xmath18 , and surrounds both regions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , from four dimensional observers viewpoints , it is interpreted that the four dimensional spacetime ends there .    </S>",
    "<S> -@xmath43 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the region of @xmath44 is removed . ]    in order to analyze the global structure we introduce null coordinates @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 in this null coordinate system the induced metric becomes @xmath47\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 the expansion rate of out / in - going null geodesic congruence is @xmath49 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the spacetime is locally a four dimensional desitter spacetime , the structure in terms of the expansion rates is simple as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . each expansion @xmath50 vanishes on the null surface @xmath51 , is positive in the region @xmath52 and is negative in the region @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are satisfied on the @xmath56 surfaces .    from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , one can easily see that , from the view point of observers sitting at the center @xmath57 ( i.e. @xmath58 ) of the spherical symmetry , the boundary @xmath59 is always beyond the cosmological horizons @xmath60 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> freely - falling observers off the center can be affected by the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> for example , let us consider comoving observers in the flat - chart covering the region @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> as easily seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , some observers ( the observer 1 in fig . 3 ) will reach the edge @xmath59 in finite affine time if the deviation from the center of spherical symmetry is large enough . for a small but non - zero deviation , the observer ( the observer 2 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) will not reach the edge but will be in the causal future of the bubble in lorentzian region after some time .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we investigated the spacetime structure from the four dimensional viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the extra dimension and the five dimensional structure . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the extra dimension is given by @xmath16 in the region covered by the coordinate system adopted in ( [ eqn:5dmetric ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is equivalent to @xmath62 and , thus , can be extended to the open universe region @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the size of the extra dimension is not bounded from above in the open universe region . </S>",
    "<S> it is , thus , natural to ask what the ratio of the size of extra dimension to the size of the four dimensional universe is . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see below that the ratio is roughly @xmath63 , which can be made arbitrarily small by fine - tuning the @xmath0-brane tension .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 in @xmath17-@xmath65 plane . </S>",
    "<S> only the region @xmath66 is considered since the other region @xmath67 is removed . </S>",
    "<S> the surface @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath68 and separates the spacetime into two regions , that is , the region @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 and the region @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the metric of the full five - dimensional spacetime , which is locally isometric to the desitter spacetime , is written as @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is the metric of @xmath75 and is transformed to the standard form by @xmath76 so that @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , without the deficit angle due to the @xmath0-brane , the five dimensional spacetime would be the maximally extended de sitter spacetime not only locally but also globally . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we shall see below that the presence of the @xmath0-brane and the deficit angle introduces an intriguing structure . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-brane is located at @xmath78 , where the extra dimension of @xmath79 shrinks .    in order to visualize the five dimensional spacetime structure in the presence of the closed @xmath0-brane and the deficit angle ( @xmath80 ) , it is convenient to go to a flat chart . note , however , that the same structure looks differently for different choices of the origin of the flat chart since the presence of the @xmath0-brane breaks the global translational invariance . here , we choose the origin of the flat chart @xmath81 as @xmath82 in this flat chart , the @xmath0-brane is located at the intersection of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for a deficit angle larger than @xmath85 or , equivalently </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath86 , the spacetime region is restricted by . if the deficit angle were smaller than @xmath85 ( and thus @xmath87 ) then it would be convenient to change the origin of @xmath6 so that @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> this would correspond to the change of the origin of the flat chart to the opposite point on the @xmath75 . with this change </S>",
    "<S> , the inequality in ( 19 ) would be opposite and @xmath9 in the right hand side would be replaced by the deficit angle @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the case of a large deficit angle ( @xmath86 ) the spacetime is the outside of a pancake - shaped region but not the inside . in the limit of zero deficit angle ( @xmath90 ) </S>",
    "<S> the maximally extended de sitter spacetime is recovered as the thickness of the pancake - shaped region vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> ] @xmath91 where we have chosen the origin of @xmath6 so that @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath93-dimensional spacetime has a pancake - like ( or convex lens - like ) shape as already discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the expression ( 19 ) also makes it evident that the ratio of the size of the extra dimension ( the thickness of the pancake ) to the size of the four dimensional universe ( the radius of the pancake ) is roughly @xmath63 .        </S>",
    "<S> the spacetime discussed here can be created from nothing via an instanton . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton is obtained simply by analytic continuation on the @xmath94 surface . in the euclidean regime ( @xmath95 ) , the five dimensional euclidean geometry is locally isometric to the @xmath93-sphere @xmath96 as @xmath97 while eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ slices ] ) becomes @xmath98 hence @xmath99 surfaces are cross sections of the four dimensional unit - sphere @xmath100 with the surface defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ slices - euclid ] ) ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of the spacetime with 2-brane at @xmath94 because @xmath94 surface is momentary static . </S>",
    "<S> note that the path depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 corresponds to a quantum creation of the whole universe with a closed 2-brane . </S>",
    "<S> as we have already mentioned , the region @xmath101 can be regarded as an open universe . </S>",
    "<S> so the current path may be interpreted as creation of the open inflationary universe with a 2-brane . </S>",
    "<S> ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 6 ] for creation of open universes via a singular instanton . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 7,8 ] a regular instanton similar to our instanton was proposed . )    </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize our study . </S>",
    "<S> in a five dimensional theory admitting a positive cosmological constant , we considered a spacetime with a closed 2-brane . despite the fact that it is locally a de sitter spacetime , a large enough deficit angle due to the presence of the @xmath0-brane introduces an intriguing structure . depending on observers , </S>",
    "<S> the spacetime can be effectively four dimensional at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , while the size of the extra - dimension is not bounded from above in general , its ratio to the size of the four dimensional universe can be made as small as one likes by fine - tuning the @xmath0-brane tension . </S>",
    "<S> if the deficit angle exceeds @xmath85 then the spacetime has a pancake - like ( or convex lens - like ) shape with the upper and lower surfaces identified . </S>",
    "<S> all observers are confined inside the pancake - shaped region surrounded by the closed @xmath0-brane .    </S>",
    "<S> the edge of the pancake mimics the surface of the kaluza - klein bubble of nothing and all observers in the pancake are outside the `` bubble '' . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is the boundary of the four dimensional spacetime . </S>"
