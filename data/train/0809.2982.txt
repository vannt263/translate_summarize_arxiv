    "recent advances in vacuum stabilization in string theory , most notably the kklt @xcite and the large volume @xcite varieties , have put stringy realizations of cosmic inflation on a much firmer footing .",
    "only when all moduli have been stabilized does it make sense to study which of them might be candidates for inflation .",
    "string theory provides an abundance of moduli fields , for example the size and shape of the extra dimensions , and thus many potential opportunities for inflation .",
    "these include single - field models , such as ref .",
    "@xcite , and multiple - field models such as the racetrack model @xcite , the n - flation scenario @xcite , or the swiss - cheese scenario @xcite .",
    "multiple field inflation has the advantage of more easily providing some of the nonstandard observational features that one would like for helping to discriminate between theories .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom allow the production of isocurvature modes ( perturbations transverse to the classical trajectory ) and it has become apparent @xcite that these may give rise to large nongaussianities in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations .",
    "one such model is the roulette scenario @xcite , in which the calabi - yau manifold ( the compactified extra dimensions of string theory ) relaxes from an initial excited state towards a minimum of its potential .",
    "the large volume compactification that is used ensures that this minimum exists for large ranges of the microscopic parameters .",
    "in addition , unlike kklt , it does not require tuning the constant term in the superpotential to very small values , and it gives a natural expansion parameter , the inverse volume @xmath2 , providing a controlled @xmath3 expansion . in this particular model , the last four - cycle and corresponding axionic partner to relax act as slow rolling scalar fields which drive the final stage of inflation .",
    "specializing to a specific set of microscopic parameters , we explored the various trajectories of inflation available within the context of this two - field model .",
    "the prediction of observable parameter values were in accordance with known results from cmb and large scale structure survey data .",
    "the influence of isocurvature perturbations , which seed inhomogeneieties between the species of fields driving inflation , was furthermore found to be quite important .",
    "in addition , recent claims of detection of nongaussianity in the wmap cmb data , specifically a nonvanishing nonlinearity parameter @xmath4 @xcite have sparked a large interest in deviations from gaussianity in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations as an additional observable that must be predicted by a successful theory of the early universe . given that precision measurements of @xmath4 from experiments such as planck will soon be available ,",
    "it is all the more important that the mechanisms governing the production and evolution of primordial nongaussianities be well understood .",
    "we will first provide an overview of the roulette model , followed by a discussion of primordial nongaussianities from inflation . in section [ sec :",
    "results ] we will give the main results of our paper , which are the numerical caluclations of nongaussianities in the curvature perturbation .",
    "the important aspects of our calculations , which follow @xcite , are presented in appendix a.",
    "the roulette model is a string theoretic inflationary scenario set in the context of a type iib large volume compactification .",
    "although there may be evolution of several khler moduli , the observable part of inflation is governed by last ( and lightest ) one to relax .",
    "since the earlier - evolving moduli stabilize to deep minuma , they rapidly decouple from the dynamics @xcite , before the final 60 @xmath5-foldings .",
    "the name `` roulette '' comes from the cyclic shape of the potential , resembling a roulette table whose grooves are the minima toward which the inflaton eventually relaxes ( figure [ potential1 ] ) . during inflation , the f - term potential of the large volume compactification is flat enough to allow slow - rolling over sizeable patches of field space . reheating , which we will not address here , occurs when the inflaton fields oscillate at the bottom of the potential .",
    "this model was first proposed as a single - field inflation model by conlon and quevedo in @xcite , and subsequently generalized to include the axion as a second inflaton field by bond , kofman , prokushkin and vaudrevange in ref .",
    "@xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the large - volume compactification @xcite , in which the 10 spacetime dimensions of type iib string theory are separated into a 4-dimensional noncompact spacetime and a conformally calabi - yau 3-fold .     and its axionic partner @xmath6 for parameters in table 2 .",
    "the potential is periodic in the @xmath6 direction.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    after minimizing the f - term potential in the large volume compactification with respect to the axio - dilaton and all khler moduli but @xmath7 , the potential can be expressed as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . after expanding in powers of @xmath2 this potential reduces to @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the uplifting contribution , of order @xmath12 @xcite , adjusted so that that @xmath13 at its minimum .",
    "it is crucial for the naturalness of khler moduli inflation that @xmath11 depends only very weakly upon @xmath14 in the case of interest , where @xmath15 . because of this , @xmath11 is nearly constant during inflation , and the slow - roll condition on @xmath14 is easily satisfied . fig .",
    "[ potential1 ] shows the form of the potential .    for notational purposes",
    "we define @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the kinetic term takes the diagonal form : @xmath18 with the @xmath19 component of the khler metric given by @xcite @xmath20}{4(2{\\mathcal{v}}+\\xi)^2\\sqrt{\\tau_2}}. \\label{k22}\\ ] ]    in the original khler moduli inflation model @xcite the standard model was confined to a d7-brane that wraps the inflaton cycle .",
    "it has recently been pointed out , however , @xcite that string loop corrections contribute to the khler potential in such a way that the exponential flatness of @xmath21 is destroyed . this would give large contributions to the @xmath22 parameter , thereby preventing slow roll from occuring .",
    "@xcite does point out that this can be remedied by removing the d7 brane from the inflating cycle , which has the disadvantage of complicating the reheating process .",
    "this could proceed via a mechanism akin to the ones studied in multiple - throat inflationary models in warped compactifications .",
    "see for instance ref .",
    "given that we are only concerned with the inflationary phase in the present paper , we will take the potential as is .",
    "slow - roll inflationary scenarios generically predict a near - scale invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations , with nearly gaussian statistics .",
    "this is expected , since individual quantum fluctuations can be treated as independent results and should therefore be gaussian by virtue of the central limit theorem . however , more complex field interactions , along with interactions with gravity , which is inherently non - linear , are sure to produce at least small deviations from gaussianity . due to the stochastic nature of these perturbations , it is therefore natural to develop statistical tools to compare predictions of the theory with cmb observations .",
    "wick s theorem tells us that the even moments ( @xmath23-point correlators ) of a linear field or distribution @xmath24 decompose into a sum over the permutations of two - point correlators , whereas the odd moments vanish .",
    "the measurement of deviations from gaussianity in a field @xmath25 , can therefore be made through the bispectrum ( the fourier transform of the three - point correlator ) , and through the connected part of the trispectrum , that is , the part of the fourier transform of the four - point correlator that can not be decomposed into products of the power spectrum .",
    "it is common to parameterize the small deviations from gaussianity in terms of their effect on the bardeen potential @xmath26 through @xmath4 @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a purely gaussian random field with @xmath29 . even for large @xmath4",
    "this parameterisation is sufficient , given that the fluctuations @xmath26 are order @xmath30 . already with the cobe observations it was shown that the nongaussian fraction of @xmath26 must be less than a few percent , @xmath31",
    "( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent measurements have tightened this limit to the level of @xmath32 .",

[ cols=\"^,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fnltable ]      in the case of more highly curved trajectories , the isocurvature modes were found to have a large , positive effect on the power spectrum of adiabatic perturbations , and consequently on the scalar spectral index @xmath34 , as recently shown in @xcite .",
    "large curvature in field space during the course of inflation resulted in a `` projection '' of the isocurvature modes onto the adiabatic direction .",
    "for some trajectories with long periods of curving , over 90% of the power spectrum originated from the isocurvature modes .",
    "table [ fnltable ] gives the proportion of the observable curvature power spectrum at the end of inflation that results from the influence of the isocurvature mode : @xmath35 where the subscript @xmath36 indicates that these quantities were evaluated at the cobe scale , which we take to be the modes that crossed the horizon 55 e - foldings before the end of inflation .",

    "the full scalar spectral index @xmath34 at cobe scales was computed by taking the derivative of a cubic fit of @xmath42 , with the power spectrum evaluated from : @xmath43 here we have used the fact that in the gauge @xmath44 with @xmath45 approximately constant , @xmath46",
    ". table [ fnltable ] gives a comparison of both methods of computing @xmath34 .",
    "our results indicate that a significantly larger power spectrum , along with a generically red - tilted spectrum is an expected result of curved trajectories in roulette inflation .",
    "this is of particular interest , given that the most recent cosmological data favor a scalar spectral index of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the subject of nongaussianity in the roulette model .",
    "because it gives examples of highly curved field trajectories , one might have hoped to find observably large levels of nongaussianity coming from the isocurvature modes . however , the numerics do not bear out this expectation , as we now describe .",
    "we tested the algorithm for computing @xmath4 from superhorizon evolution of perturbation modes on the two - field quadratic inflation model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , verified its results .",
    "we then analyzed the nonlinear mode evolution for a variety of roulette inflation trajectories , for modes @xmath48 corresponding to a range of horizon exit times @xmath49 before the end of inflation .",
    "the green s function in eq . was found by solving the ode numerically in matrix form , as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "this was done once per time step @xmath51 , giving a @xmath52 dimensional array , where @xmath53 corresponds to the number of discrete time steps sampled in the evolution ( typically around 1000 ) .",
    "figure [ roulettegreens ] shows this behavior for trajectory c of figure 2 .",
    "-0.9 cm    inflation in the @xmath54 valley , corresponding to the effective one - field scenario of conlon and quevedo @xcite produced no nongaussianities originating from superhorizon interaction between scalar modes ( @xmath55 , where the deviation from zero can be attributed to numerical uncertainty ) .",
    "this is not surprising , since it is the coupling between curvature and isocurvature modes that is expected to generate large bispectra . from the adiabatic fluctuations",
    "should give values of order @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "] in more complex inflationary trajectories with sufficient curving in field space , however , we found that values of @xmath4 between @xmath57 and @xmath58 were quite generically produced .",
    "but we did not find any examples which produced @xmath4 outside of the small range @xmath59 this is far below the level of sensitivity foreseen by the planck experiment , for example .",
    "figure [ fnltdep ] illustrates the time - dependence of @xmath4 at a series of wave - numbers @xmath48 from horizon exit to the end of inflation , for the representative trajectory c in figure [ trajectories ] ) , while figure [ fnlkdep ] shows the @xmath48-dependence of @xmath4 after it has stopped evolving .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath4 shown is typical for trajectories that continued to curve during most of the period of observable inflation : they produce slightly more pronounced values of @xmath4 during the curved part of the motion , but these values quickly descend to @xmath60 by the end of inflation .",
    "the two - field model studied in @xcite also exhibits this behaviour : @xmath0 descends to zero as the trajectory straightens out at the end of inflation , resulting in a bispectrum below the level of measurable sensitivity .",
    "table [ fnltable ] gives some computed values of @xmath61 ( where the @xmath62 form an equilateral triangle ) at scales @xmath48 that crossed the horizon at @xmath63 e - foldings , as well as @xmath64 for squeezed triangles , with @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "trajectories labeled a through g are shown in figure [ trajectories ] .",
    "the bottom part of table [ fnltable ] shows results for different parameter sets ( given in table [ paramset ] ) .",
    "values of @xmath4 are taken at the end of inflation .",
    "features in @xmath70 can be understood as being due to curvature of the trajectory at the time of horizon exit of particular modes .",
    "modes that experienced more curving after horizon exit ( _ i.e. , _ those which exited the horizon earlier ) produced larger magnitude @xmath4 than those which experienced no curving .",
    "these features in the bispectrum are completely absent in single - field inflation .",
    "one feature that was common to curved roulette trajectories was a slightly larger bispectrum on large scales , due to the modes which left the horizon before turning in field space occurred .",
    "this occurs because only superhorizon - scale modes can experience growth due to the coupling between isocurvature and adiabatic modes ( this effect can also be seen in table [ fnltable ] , which shows the correlation between large isocurvature contributions to the power and larger values of @xmath4 ) .",
    "smaller scales which exit the horizon later undergo less such growth .",
    "thus a simultaneous detection of larger @xmath4 in the cmb and smaller primordial non - linearity in large - scale structure may be a way to detect this type of result , if its magnitude can be enhanced to an observable level .",
    "one somewhat nonstandard feature of the roulette model , relative to simpler two - field models , is the nontrivial field metric @xmath71 ( eq .  ( [ k22 ] ) which multiplies the kinetic term of the axionic direction @xmath6 .",
    "we found that it had no substantial effect on the shape , size , or magnitude of the bispectrum . to test this , we tried replacing @xmath72 by a constant during inflation , and found that the spectrum of observables remained roughly unchanged .    as illustrated in table [ fnltable ] , the shape - dependence of the observed nongaussianities is as expected from this type of model @xcite , since nongaussianities from superhorizon evolution are larger in the squeezed configuration , whereas those generated on subhorizon scales ( like in dbi inflation ) are larger in the equilateral configuration . in all cases ,",
    "we find that @xmath4 is larger for the squeezed configuration .",
    "we have studied a model of khler moduli inflation built from a realistic construction of type iib string theory , using the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "we confirm previous results for the power spectrum and the superhorizon influence of isocurvature modes for typical inflationary trajectories .",
    "the main new undertaking is a search for nongaussian perturbations from highly curved trajectories .",
    "such deviations from gaussianity can originate from the superhorizon evolution of the second - order curvature perturbation and its interaction with isocurvature perturbations .",
    "when the full spectrum is considered , roulette inflation predicts a smooth power spectrum with a slight red - tilt , in excellent agreement with estimates based on the latest wmap data .",
    "in addition , as shown by @xcite , the superhorizon influence of isocurvature modes can come to dominate the scalar curvature power spectrum via the relation .",
    "this is the case for inflationary trajectories with large curvature , which can be pictured as a `` projection '' of the isocurvature perturbation modes onto the adiabatic direction .",
    "this contribution , which can account for over 90% of the curvature power spectrum , must therefore be considered in the context of these multiple - field inflationary models .    concerning the issue of nongaussianity",
    ", we did not find examples in which @xmath4 , produced by the mechanism considered in section [ sec : results ] , could be large enough to be observable by future missions ; we obtained results which did not exceed the level of @xmath4 expected in conventional single - field inflation models .",
    "it was hoped that trajectories with very sharp curving in field space would have yielded larger @xmath4 values , but two considerations could make this difficult .",
    "first , if the trajectory relaxes to a straight , effectively single - field form before the end of inflation , @xmath0 damps to zero , as illustrated in figure 1 of ref .",
    "we found trajectories with moderate curving until the end of inflation , which prevented the total erasure of @xmath4 .",
    "multiple - field ( `` multi - brid '' ) hybrid inflation models such as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite use this effect to produce sizable nongaussianities .",
    "second , large deviation from gaussianity from this method is correlated with large isocurvature modes being projected onto the curvature direction .",
    "if one is able to find models with large @xmath0 , it must be verified that the power - spectrum is not overly amplified and distorted by this effect .",
    "this phenomenon is also seen to play an important role in nongaussianity generated by the waterfall fields in hybrid inflation models @xcite .    however , it is possible that a more complete search of the model s parameter space would reveal examples with larger values of @xmath0 . in that case , running bispectra ( _ i.e. _ , which depend on the magnitude of the average scale of @xmath73 , as opposed to the shape - dependence ) , such as we find in the roulette model , could provide an interesting discriminator between models .",
    "recent developments in the detection of nongaussianity via large - scale structure , which would probe @xmath4 at smaller scales , promise to give additional observational handles on such a dependence @xcite",
    ".    it may be interesting to examine other such moduli inflation scenarios that arise once the assumptions of a strict hierarchy of scale are relaxed ( for instance , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the second dynamical field is the inverse overall volume , rather than the axionic partner ) . a more general study of two - field inflationary models with such an exponentially flat potential",
    "would furthermore reveal how generic the above - mentioned behavior is .",

    "we present here the important results of @xcite , which were used in the computation of the first- and second - order quantities that formed our main results .",

    "<S> using the gradient expansion method of rigopoulos , shellard and van tent which treats cosmological perturbations as gradients on top of a homogeneous and isotropic frw background , we study the production of nongaussianities in the roulette model of inflation . investigating a number of trajectories within this two - field model of inflation , we find that while the superhorizon influence of the isocurvature modes on the curvature bispectrum produces nonzero contribution to @xmath0 , the effect is negligible next to the standard inflationary prediction @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in both the squeezed and equilateral configurations of the bispectrum , although the former is slightly larger in the trajectories under consideration . </S>"
