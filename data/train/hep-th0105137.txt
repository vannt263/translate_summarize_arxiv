    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite asserts that a gravity theory on 5d anti de sitter space ( ads ) is ` dual ' to a 4d conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the duality takes the form of an equality of generating functionals depending on some 4d fields @xmath0 that act as boundary values for the gravity fields on ads and source terms for operators in the cft : _ .",
    "h |_bdy = h_0 d[h ] e^is_grav[h ] = e^i h_0 _ cft .",
    "this correspondence remains at present an unproven conjecture , but in string theory realizations it passes an impressive number of quantitative and qualitative consistency checks , and has proved extremely fruitful in suggesting new connections @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in that this duality can be extended to the equivalence between the 5d ` brane world ' scenario of randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite and a conformal field theory perturbed by four - dimensional gravity . in this duality",
    "the ` uv brane ' in the rs model where gravity is localized is mapped to a uv cutoff for the cft and the redshifted ` ir brane ' is mapped to spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance @xcite , which provides an ir cutoff of the cft . as stressed in ,",
    "both sides of this perturbed duality are macroscopically 4d theories with a discrete spectrum , and hence the equivalence reduces simply to the statement that both theories give identical predictions for all physical quantities such as the s - matrix .",
    "this conjecture also passes several quantitative checks @xcite and many qualitative ones @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will study 4d cft s that can be viewed as being dual to the rs model with supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological motivation for this class of models is quite different from the original rs model , where the redshift factor between the uv and ir branes was used to explain the hierarchy between the planck and weak scales . in the susy rs model , it is susy that solves the hierarchy problem .",
    "the motivation for the extra dimension comes from the susy flavor problem .",
    "if we assume that there is no flavor symmetry at the planck scale , then the low - energy effective theory necessarily includes contact terms of the form _",
    "eff ~d^4 ^q^q , where @xmath1 is the hidden sector field that breaks susy and @xmath2 is a visible sector field .",
    "such terms can not be forbidden by any symmetry , and give a contribution to the squark masses of order @xmath3 that has no reason to be flavor diagonal . in hidden sector models where soft susy breaking parameters are of order @xmath4 , it is therefore difficult to understand why the squark masses are nearly flavor independent , as required by constraints on flavor - changing neutral currents",
    ". showed that this problem can be solved if the visible and hidden sectors are localized on different branes , separated in an extra dimension .",
    "the spatial separation suppresses contact terms between the hidden and visible sectors @xcite . in ,",
    "this was referred to as ` sequestering ' the hidden sector .",
    "if there are no massless fields in the bulk other than supergravity , susy breaking is communicated from the supergravity sector to the visible sector by anomaly mediation @xcite ( after radion stabilization @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that the visible sector contains only the mssm and assuming no other couplings between the visible and hidden sectors implies that slepton mass - squared terms are negative , but by relaxing these assumptions realistic and predictive models have been constructed that preserve the attractive features of the scenario @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence extended to the susy rs set - up asserts that anomaly - mediated models can be realized in a purely 4d theory .",
    "the necessary ingredients in the 4d theory are determined simply by following the correspondence .",
    "the bulk supergravity modes in the 5d description are mapped to a strongly - coupled superconformal field theory ( scft ) in the 4d theory .",
    "visible sector fields localized on the uv brane in the 5d description are mapped to elementary fields in the 4d theory that are coupled to the scft only through planck - suppressed operators .",
    "hidden sector fields localized on the ir brane in the 5d description are mapped to composites of the scft that arise from the spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance .",
    "stabilization of the extra - dimensional radius is mapped to the stabilization of the modulus in the cft responsible for spontaneous breakdown of scale invariance .",
    "finally , the condition on the 5d theory that there are no light bulk modes other than supergravity responsible for transmitting supersymmetry breaking is mapped to the condition that only irrelevant scft operators couple to the visible fields .",
    "we will be interested in strongly - coupled scft s with no expansion parameters , such as large @xmath5 or large t hooft parameter .",
    "ads duals of such theories are not known , presumably because there is no parametric separation between the string length , the ads radius , and the planck length . in order to achieve sequestering in such a theory by decoupling the effects of massive bulk states , we require an extra dimension that extends over several ads radii . at the level of effective field theory ,",
    "the existence of such strongly warped susy models was demonstrated in . in it was shown that radius stabilization and anomaly - mediated susy breaking",
    "can be realized in this scenario .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that sequestering and anomaly mediation are indeed realized in a large class of 4d susy theories .",
    "the theories can be explicitly constructed and understood from a purely 4d perspective , and demonstrate that sequestering can be realized without positing extra dimensions or branes .",
    "however , we find the dual 5d description , where sequestering has a simple geometrical origin , very illuminating .",
    "we therefore refer to this class of models as ` composite extra dimensions . '",
    "considered susy models where the mssm has superpotential couplings to a strong scft and studied implications for flavor and susy breaking . constructed non - susy gauge theories whose low - energy dynamics mimics that of a theory with an extra dimension .",
    "we will briefly discuss the relation of these papers to our work in the conclusions .",
    "the prototype of the kind of scft to which our results apply is the strongly coupled fixed point of @xmath6 susy qcd with @xmath7 flavors found by seiberg @xcite . for @xmath8 ,",
    "this theory is asymptotically free in the uv but has a nontrivial conformal fixed point in the ir . for @xmath9 the ir fixed point",
    "is weakly coupled @xcite , and for @xmath10 the ir fixed point has a weakly - coupled dual description @xcite , but in the middle of the range the ir fixed point has no known weakly - coupled lagrangian description . in what follows",
    ", we will write our results for the special case @xmath11 , @xmath12 for simplicity . in that case",
    "there are 8 @xmath13 fundamentals @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we define @xmath16 to be the scale below which the theory is in the ir conformal regime , and above which the theory rapidly runs to its asymptotically free regime .",
    "the crucial question is the size of scalar masses induced by flavor - violating couplings of the form _ eff = d^4 t_j^t^j q_j^q^k , where @xmath17 is a hidden sector susy qcd field .",
    "note that we have assumed that the coupling is diagonal in hidden flavor , which can be made natural by imposing ( discrete and/or gauged ) flavor symmetries on the hidden sector . in order for anomaly mediation to dominate , we require that this term contribute visible scalar masses @xmath18 ( see section 3 ) , where @xmath19 is the susy breaking vacuum energy",
    ". we will discuss the mechanism of this susy breaking in the hidden sector in the next section .",
    "the suppression factor of @xmath20 must arise from the nontrivial cft scaling of the operator .",
    "this term can be viewed as a correction to the kinetic term for the @xmath17 fields in the uv lagrangian _",
    "uv = d^4 z_0 t_j^t^j + , z_0 = 1 + q^_j q^k .",
    "this contributes to a perturbation of the physical gauge coupling @xmath21 , given by @xcite = - g^2 - z + + ( g^2 ) , where @xmath22 is the holomorphic gauge coupling that appears as the coefficient of the gauge kinetic term in the lagrangian . because is a perturbation to the uv gauge coupling",
    ", it is necessarily irrelevant near the fixed point .",
    "this is simply because the theory near a fixed point must be insensitive to uv couplings in order to be ir attractive , as seiberg argued is the case in susy qcd .    to make this quantitative ,",
    "let us consider how the operator runs down to the ir in two stages .",
    "first , the running down to the scale @xmath16 where the theory becomes strong is the standard logarithmic running in the far uv , together with an order unity strong - interaction renormalization near @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath16 is defined such that @xmath23 is a _ fixed number _",
    "close enough to the fixed point coupling @xmath24 that below this scale we can expand about the fixed point : =  _ * ( g^2 - g_*^2 ) + , = _ * +  _ * ( g^2 - g_*^2 ) + , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the anomalous dimension at the fixed point is determined by the ( non - anomalous ) @xmath27 symmetry to be @xmath28 integrating these renormalization group equations from @xmath16 down to @xmath29 then gives z ( ) = z(_cft ) ( ) ^ _ * \\ { 1 + + } .",
    "we can rewrite this using evaluated at @xmath16 and the fact that @xmath30 has exact one - loop running , z ( ) = ( ) ^ _ * \\ { 1 + + } , where _ hole^-4 ^ 2 / g^2_hol ( ) is the holomorphic one - loop strong - interaction scale .    is useful because it shows that the leading dependence on @xmath31 ( contained in @xmath32 ) has disappeared in the ir below @xmath16 .",
    "the subleading dependence on @xmath31 is implicit in the dependence on @xmath16 , which is suppressed by the power @xmath33 .",
    "( note that @xmath16 depends on @xmath31 through its definition , @xmath34 , and also . )",
    "the fixed point behavior is cut off at the scale @xmath35 where the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken , so we obtain the required suppression for @xmath36 .    it is crucial that the perturbation is a singlet under the hidden sector flavor symmetries . for a non - singlet operator of the form = d^4 t^_j t^k q^_j q^k , with @xmath37 ,",
    "the contribution to the visible sector scalar masses is ( m^2_q)^j_k = - d^4 t^_j t^k this is a matrix element of a conserved current supermultiplet with vanishing anomalous dimension , so there is no cft suppression of operators of the form .",
    "a model - building requirement is therefore to insist on enough symmetry in the hidden dynamics to prohibit such operators .    in the susy",
    "limit the theory above has a moduli space of vacua , and away from the origin of moduli space the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the light fields below the scale @xmath38 where the conformal symmetry is broken are the moduli , which can be thought of as composites of the cft .",
    "we now consider the effective field theory for these moduli .",
    "the moduli space can be parameterized by the gauge - invariant holomorphic operators @xcite . in the @xmath13 gauge theory we are considering , the moduli space is parameterized completely by the ` meson ' invariants m^jk = t^j",
    "t^k = -m^kj . from we",
    "see that the dependence on @xmath39 can be eliminated by working in terms of the renormalized fields t^j = .",
    "since @xmath40 parametrizes the only explicit scale in the hidden dynamics , and since the new fields eliminate dependence on this scale near the ir fixed point , the leading low - energy interactions must be given by _",
    "eff = d^4 f(m , m^ ) + ( ^4 ) + ( _ cft^-_* ) , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a homogeneous function with its degree determined by dimensional analysis : f(m , m^ ) = ^4/3 f(m , m^ ) .",
    "the new fields are very convenient later because they have the same canonical dimension as their scaling dimension in superpotential terms , allowing us to simultaneously non - linearly realize the asymptotic ( canonical ) scale invariance in the uv and the non - trivial asymptotic scale invariance in the ir .    there is another way to derive the absence of @xmath31 dependence in the leading terms of the low - energy theory , , that may be illuminating .",
    "we can regard @xmath31 as a background gauge connection for an anomalous @xmath43 symmetry @xcite .",
    "because of the anomaly , @xmath39 is charged under this symmetry with a charge such that the renormalized fields are uncharged under @xmath43 .",
    "the leading terms in the low - energy effective theory are therefore independent of the @xmath43 gauge connection . by contrast , perturbations of the form can be regarded as background gauge connections for non - anomalous hidden flavor symmetries .",
    "therefore @xmath40 is uncharged under these gauge connections and can not cancel their effects in the low - energy theory , .",
    "we now show how to construct a realistic 4d model in which susy breaking is communicated by anomaly mediation , with the suppression of contact terms explained by the mechanism described above .",
    "our aim is to construct a model which illustrates the issues in constructing a realistic model , and separates these issues as clearly as possible .",
    "the model we discuss contains several explicit small superpotential couplings whose origin is not explained .",
    "we believe that completely natural models without fundamental small parameters are possible , but the leave their construction for future work .    the hidden sector will be taken to be @xmath13 gauge theory with 8 fundamentals @xmath14 ( @xmath44 , as discussed in the last section .",
    "the classical moduli space of this theory can be parameterized by the ` meson ' operators @xmath45 ( see ) .",
    "@xmath46 is an antisymmetric matrix with rank 2 , which can be conveniently parameterized by m = , = , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are unconstrained .",
    "note that this has 13 complex degrees of freedom , as required given the sixteen quark fields and the three d - flatness conditions .",
    "we will expand about the vacuum = .",
    "it will be convenient to further parameterize y = , ( ) = 0 .",
    "upon adding superpotential terms we will see that susy is broken by @xmath49 .",
    "the low - energy effective theory below the scale determined by the vev @xmath50 was described in the previous section .",
    "the contribution to the effective potential is a homogeneous function of the meson fields of degree @xmath51 , which must also be @xmath52 invariant .",
    "we will always work in terms of the ` renormalized ' primed fields of the previous section , dropping the primes .",
    "the vev breaks the @xmath52 global symmetry to @xmath53 , so expanding in powers of @xmath48 gives k_eff = a_0 ( x^x)^2/3 , where @xmath54 are unknown strong interaction parameters .",
    "it is convenient to work in terms of redefined fields = a_0 ^ 1/2 x^3/2 , = a_0 ^ 3/4 a_1 ^ 1/2 , which have a canonical potential : k_eff = ^ + ^ + ( ||^4 / ||^2 ) .",
    "as described so far , the model has unbroken susy and a moduli space of vacua .",
    "we now add superpotential terms that stabilize the moduli and break susy .",
    "we will take our model , and the superpotential in particular , to respect an @xmath13 subgroup of the global @xmath52 symmetry .",
    "( this flavor @xmath13 symmetry can be weakly gauged but we will not consider this here . ) for convenience we give names to the four @xmath13 doublets as follows : p^1,2 = t^1,2 , |p^1,2 = t^3,4 , n^1,2 = t^5,6 , |n^1,2 = t^7,8 , so that x = p^j p_j , = p^j |p_j , where @xmath55 are global @xmath13 indices , and we have defined @xmath56 , _",
    "etc_. in addition to the global @xmath13 we impose the following discrete symmetries : ( i )  & p |p , n |n , + ( ii )  & p n , |p |n , + ( iii )  & p ip , |p -i |p , n i n , |n -i|n , + ( iv )  & p ip , |p -i |p , n -i n , |n i|n . these symmetries",
    "ensure that the only allowed term of the form @xmath57 is ( accidentally ) @xmath52 invariant .",
    "therefore the only term of the form @xmath58 is a singlet of the cft flavor symmetries , and is suppressed by the renormalization group arguments of the previous section .",
    "these symmetries allow us to add the following terms to the superpotential : w = w_stab + w_mass + w_polonyi , where & w_stab & = _ 1 + & + _ 2 , + & w_mass & = c_1 _ a = 1 ^ 3 + & + c_2 , + & w_polonyi = , and where @xmath59 are the pauli matrices for flavor @xmath13 .",
    "gauge - singlet operators are enclosed by parentheses . at the scale @xmath16",
    "the @xmath13 gauge interactions become strong and the theory flows to a nontrivial conformal fixed point . at this point",
    "the scaling of the operators is controlled by the nontrivial fixed point .",
    "we will assume that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the scale where 4d quantum gravity becomes strong .",
    "we will work in units where @xmath62 .",
    "below the scale @xmath63 the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken and the effective degrees of freedom of the cft are the moduli . writing the superpotential in terms of the moduli fields defined in , , and we have & w_stab & = 12 _ 1 + & + 14 _ 2 , + & w_polonyi = ^1/2 , while @xmath64 is a sum of mass terms for every component of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the above , we have absorbed the unknown strong interaction coefficients of the potential into redefinitions of the superpotential couplings ( see and ) .",
    "the cft running of the superpotential perturbations is automatically taken into account by our working in terms of the primed fields defined in the previous section .",
    "our discussion assumes that the superpotential terms can be treated as linear perturbations to the cft in the energy range from @xmath61 to @xmath67 .",
    "the couplings @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are marginal and have dimensionless coefficients small compared to 1 .",
    "there are nonlinear corrections suppressed by higher powers of these couplings , but these are negligible logarithmic corrections similar to those found in weak - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "the coupling @xmath71 is irrelevant , and can therefore also be treated as a perturbation .",
    "we now determine the vev s .",
    "the stabilization term gives rise to a local susy preserving minimum with ^3 = - .",
    "( we will consider the effects of susy breaking on @xmath72 below . )",
    "this stabilizes the modulus and determines the scale of spontaneous breaking of the conformal symmetry .",
    "the mass of the @xmath47 field is of order m_x ~_1 . since @xmath73 and we want @xmath74 ( in planck units )",
    "we must have @xmath75 , and hence @xmath76 .",
    "we will take @xmath77 in what follows .",
    "below the scale @xmath78 we integrate out @xmath47 and consider the effective lagrangian of the remaining light degrees of freedom .",
    "we chose the couplings in @xmath64 so that all of the modes parameterized by @xmath65 and @xmath66 get masses @xmath79 .",
    "the only remaining degree of freedom below the scale @xmath80 is then @xmath1 .",
    "the effective superpotential is then w_eff = ^1/2 + ( ^2 / ^5 ) , where the terms higher order in @xmath81 come from the @xmath72 dependence in .",
    "the effective potential is k_eff = ^ + c + , where @xmath82 is an order one unknown strong interaction coefficient . if @xmath83 , this theory has a ( local ) susy breaking minimum with ~^1/2 , = o(/ ^7/2 ) , and @xmath1 gets a mass m_~. here we will simply make the dynamical assumption that @xmath83 . the condition that the higher order terms make only a small fractional correction to the susy breaking order parameter @xmath84 is 1 .",
    "this discussion assumes that @xmath72 is sufficiently heavy that we can integrate it out for purposes of susy breaking .",
    "we also assumed that susy breaking does not significantly shift the @xmath63 away from its susy value .",

    "we are now ready to check the numbers .",

    "the constraint is satisfied provided  _ * 1.7 . as discussed above",
    ", @xmath89 is a non - perturbatively determined exponent which we can not calculate .",
    "naive dimensional analysis @xcite tells us that @xmath90 . extrapolations using perturbation theory valid for the banks - zaks fixed points @xcite , @xmath91 , suggests that @xmath92 at the self - dual point , @xmath93 . in the absence of more rigorous information , we believe that values such as this are very reasonable .",
    "in fact we are able to construct models that allow smaller values of @xmath89 than by using stabilizing superpotentials with smaller powers of @xmath47 . in the present model ,",
    "such powers are forbidden by discrete symmetries , but we can add more fields and couplings that spontaneously break these symmetries and generate lower powers of @xmath47 below the breaking scale .",
    "the analysis of such models is slightly more involved than our present model and will not be detailed here .",
    "another dynamical assumption required in this model is that the uncalculable strong corrections have the right sign ( @xmath83 ) to give a local susy breaking vacuum at @xmath94 .",
    "this dynamical assumption can avoided by replacing @xmath95 by an oraifeartaigh sector with additional singlet fields .",
    "basically , the additional fields in the oraifeartaigh sector give larger calculable corrections than the uncalculable corrections if these singlets are sufficiently light .",
    "if some of the additional singlet fields are elementary , one must ensure that they do not get substantial @xmath7 terms , since ( standard model flavor violating ) contact interactions between these fields and the visible fields are not suppressed .",
    "we have constructed explicit models of this type .",
    "so far we have considered the hidden dynamics in flat spacetime , showing how to stabilize the moduli and break susy . because the energy scales and vevs in the hidden sector are much smaller than the planck scale , the main effect of coupling the hidden sector",
    "to supergravity is that the susy breaking contribution to the cosmological constant can be cancelled in the usual way .",
    "supergravity has a very small effect on the hidden dynamics and vacuum stabilization .",
    "the main effect of coupling supergravity to the visible sector is that susy breaking is communicated to the visible sector by the mechanism of anomaly - mediation .",
    "it is straightforward to adapt proposals in the literature @xcite for solving the tachyonic slepton problem and @xmath29-problem of anomaly mediation to the present framework .",
    "note that the stabilizing superpotential has another supersymmetric solution , @xmath96 .",
    "at this point on the moduli space the theory remains superconformal and supersymmetric , and therefore has lower energy than the local minimum , .",
    "in other words our supersymmetry - breaking vacuum is only meta - stable .",
    "however we have checked that tunneling to the true supersymmetry - preserving vacuum is highly suppressed over cosmological time scales , just as in the susy breaking scenario of .",
    "the main result of this paper is that it is possible to construct 4d susy field theories that realize the sequestering of the hidden sector .",
    "the original sequestering mechanism of had its origin in the spatial separation of the visible and hidden sectors in an extra dimension . in the 4-dimensional models considered here the role of the extra dimension",
    "is played by the many states of a superconformal field theory , as dictated by the ads / cft correspondence . using these ideas",
    "we have constructed an explicit realistic 4d model in which anomaly mediation dominates in the visible sector .",
    "the higher - dimensional realization of sequestering is geometric and highly intuitive .",
    "however , the local higher - dimensional ( @xmath97 ) susy is a significant technical complication that makes the construction of explicit models difficult . in the 4d models considered here",
    "the extra supersymmetry is implicit in the enhanced superconformal symmetry of the fixed point , and we only need to keep track of @xmath98 susy for model - building .",
    "there are many interesting further directions to pursue . in future work @xcite , we intend to extend the ideas of this paper to study 4d realizations of gaugino mediation @xcite and radion mediation @xcite , where the hidden sector has a superconformal regime ( dual to having the hidden sector on the ir brane in a susy rs set - up ) .",
    "we also wish to consider the important question of constructing fully natural models with a dynamical origin for scale hierarchies .",
    "we end with some comments on related work that has appeared recently .",
    "studied strong susy cft s applied to the flavor problem and susy breaking . although the relation to the ads / cft correspondence was not discussed in this paper , for purposes of susy breaking the models of can be viewed as the cft dual of gaugino mediation @xcite , with the hidden sector localized on the uv brane .",

    "in this approach the many states of the extra dimension arise from having many four - dimensional gauge sectors , while in our approach they arise from the excited states of a simple cft . in the framework of sequestering",
    "is difficult to realize because it is not clear how to maintain locality in the the extra - dimensional interpretation in the presence of gravity .",

    "<S> we study supergravity models in _ four dimensions _ where the hidden sector is superconformal and strongly - coupled over several decades of energy below the planck scale , before undergoing spontaneous breakdown of scale invariance and supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we show that large anomalous dimensions can suppress contact terms between the hidden and visible sectors , leading to models in which the hidden sector is ` sequestered ' and anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking can naturally dominate , thus solving the supersymmetric flavor problem . </S>",
    "<S> we construct simple , explicit models of the hidden sector based on supersymmetric qcd in the conformal window . </S>",
    "<S> the present approach can be usefully interpreted as having an extra dimension responsible for sequestering replaced by the many states of a ( spontaneously - broken ) strongly - coupled superconformal hidden sector , as dictated by the ads / cft correspondence . </S>"
