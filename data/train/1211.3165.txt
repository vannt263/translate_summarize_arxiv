    "cosmic rays ( crs ) are one of the most intriguing puzzles of the last century physics .",
    "it is strongly advocated that galactic crs are accelerated by supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which are energetic and numerous enough to sustain the cr population directly measured near the earth @xcite .",
    "a plausible mechanism for cr acceleration in snrs is provided by non - linear diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "the presence of high - energy electrons in snrs is undoubtedly demonstrated by their multiwavelength spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the acceleration of nuclei is an elusive phenomenon , which , from the observational point of view , so far is supported mainly by the impact of efficient ion acceleration on the thermohydrodynamics of the shockwaves , as inferred from x - ray observations , and from the spectral shape of @xmath1-ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the isotopic abundances measured for crs indicate that @xmath3 of the material is synthesized by wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars 100  kyr before the acceleration @xcite .",
    "wr stars represent an evolutionary stage of massive ob stars , and the latter cluster in space and time within the so - called ob associations .",
    "additionally , @xmath4 of snrs originate from the gravitational collapse of a massive - star core , therefore often inside an ob association .",
    "all these considerations have given credence to the hypothesis that at least part of the crs are accelerated by the repeated action of shockwaves from massive stellar winds and snrs inside massive stellar clusters .",
    "the propagation of high - energy crs in the interstellar space is often described in terms of diffusion by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with the possible inclusion of convection and reacceleration @xcite .",
    "while propagating , crs loose their energy through many different interaction processes .",
    "electromagnetic radiation arising from such interactions is the only probe we have of cr properties in the galaxy beyond direct measurements performed in the solar system .",
    "interstellar @xmath1-ray emission is produced by cr interactions with the interstellar medium , via nucleon - nucleon inelastic collisions and electron bremsstrahlung , and with the low - energy interstellar radiation fields via inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering by electrons .",
    "the intermediate steps , i.e. the escape of crs from their sources and the early propagation in the surrounding medium , have escaped observations so far .",
    "massive stars generate intense radiation , powerful winds and explosions which alter their neighborhood and power fast shockwaves and strong supersonic turbulence .",
    "if part of the crs are accelerated in regions of massive - star formation , this turbulent medium influences their evolution , e.g. through confinement and reacceleration phenomena counter - balanced by increased radiative losses .",
    "the cygnus  x region is home to numerous massive stellar clusters @xcite embedded in a complex of giant molecular clouds .",
    "most of the molecular gas along the line of sight shows interactions with the stellar clusters , notably with cyg  ob2 at a distance of @xmath0  kpc @xcite . at a comparable distance",
    "we find the snr @xmath1  cygni , e.g. @xcite , which appears as a potential cr accelerator .",
    "in addition , milagro detected very high - energy @xmath1-ray emission from the complex @xcite , pointing to the presence of enhanced cr densities .    in this paper",
    "we summarize the results of our analysis of two years of high - energy @xmath1-ray observations of the cygnus complex by the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite .",
    "the results , discussed in detail in @xcite , reveal an unexpected scenario , where the low - density cavities blown by the massive stellar clusters form a cocoon for freshly - accelerated particles , whereas the cr population averaged over the whole complex is similar to that found in other more quiet segments of the local arm .",
    "we analyzed the region at galactic longitudes @xmath5 and latitudes @xmath6 .",
    "the multiwavelength data and analysis method are detailed in @xcite : in this section we summarize the main features .    we have used @xmath1-ray data from the first two years of observations by the _ fermi _",
    "lat between 100  mev and 100  gev , applying tight rejection criteria to reduce the backgrounds due to charged crs and the earth s atmospheric emission .",
    "below 1 gev we accepted only @xmath1-rays that converted into pairs in the thin section of the lat tracker , to reduce the angular resolution degradation due to multiple coulomb scattering .",
    "the model described hereafter was fitted to the lat data by a binned maximum likelihood procedure on a @xmath7 angular grid and independently for 10 energy bins spanning the whole energy range considered , using post - launch lat instrument response functions .    since the densities of the bulk of galactic crs are expected to vary only on scales larger than those of the gas clouds , we modeled interstellar @xmath1-ray emission from their interactions as a linear combination of components traced by atomic hydrogen ( @xmath8 ) and co ( as a surrogate of molecular hydrogen , @xmath9 ) split along the line the sight to separate the cygnus complex from the more distant perseus and outer spiral arms , plus visual extinction residuals to take into account the neutral interstellar gas missed by these two tracers .",
    "we added an ic model calculated using the galprop code @xcite and an isotropic component to account for the extragalactic diffuse @xmath1-ray background and the residual background due to charged cr interactions in the lat .",
    "below a few gev the @xmath1-ray emission from the region is dominated by the three bright pulsars j@xmath10 , j@xmath11 and j@xmath12 . to be more sensitive to interstellar structures , at energies @xmath13  gev their emission was dimmed by excluding from the analysis photons detected in their periodic pulses in a circular region around each pulsar with a radius comparable to the lat point - spread function ( psf ) 95% containment as a function of energy .",
    "other sources from the 1fgl catalog @xcite either identified with , or associated with high - confidence to sources known from other wavelengths were included as well in the analysis model .",
    "we modeled @xmath1-ray extended emission associated to the cygnus loop snr as described in @xcite .",
    "we detected significant @xmath1-ray emission associated with the radio shell of the @xmath1  cygni snr and the very high - energy @xmath1-ray source ver  j2019 + 407 located on its rim .",
    "they were modeled using geometrical templates , namely a @xmath14 disk for the radio shell of the snr @xcite and a gaussian for ver  j2019 + 407 @xcite .",
    "residuals remain unaccounted for after fitting this model , hereafter the background model , to the lat data ( fig .",
    "[ morph]b ) .",
    "the residuals peak toward the central star - forming region of cygnus x. we modeled the excess as a gaussian , obtaining as best - fit parameters @xmath15 for the centroid and a radius of @xmath16 , with an improvement in the fit to the data above 1 gev at the @xmath17 level .",
    "the hypothesis of extended emission provides a better fit to the data than an ensemble of discrete point sources .",
    "no spectral variations across the emission region could be detected @xcite .",
    "the residual emission ( fig .  [ morph ] ) extends from the cyg  ob2 stellar cluster to the @xmath1  cygni snr , peaking toward the most conspicuous clusters like cyg  ob2 itself and ngc  6910 .",
    "however , it is more broadly distributed than any of these objects .",
    "it is unlikely that the broad @xmath1-ray excess is produced by a wind nebula powered by psr j2021 + 4026 ( likely to be associated with the 7-kyr old @xmath1  cygni snr ) or by psr j2032 + 4127 ( which is probably located behind cygnus in the perseus arm , @xcite ) .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of a wind nebula powered by a yet undiscovered pulsar , but the morphology of the @xmath1-ray excess strongly suggests an interstellar origin .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1-ray excess is bounded by the photon - dominated regions , visible through dust emission at 8  @xmath18 m .",
    "the excess closely follows the morphology of the ionized cavities formed by the boisterous winds of the numerous massive star clusters in cygnus x , as in a cocoon .",
    "the emission from the cocoon is hard and extends to 100  gev .",
    "the cocoon overlaps the tev source mgro  j2031 + 41 detected by milagro .",
    "those overlap as well the arcmin source tev j2032 + 4130 detected by hegra and magic . however , the flux measured by milagro above 10 tev exceeds the extrapolation of that measured by hegra at lower energies @xcite .",
    "ionized gas was not part of the background model .",
    "it can be traced by free - free emission in the microwave band .",
    "adding an ionized gas template instead of the @xmath19 gaussian provides an equally good fit , but only at the expense of a hard spectrum , much harder than for the other gas phases (   [ crcontent ] ) .",
    "it is consistent with that obtained with the gaussian template ( * ? ? ?",
    "s7 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ spec ] we compare    tev @xcite . the continuous ( blue ) line and upper dashed ( blue ) line show the spectrum expected from ionized gas illuminated by crs with the local interstellar spectrum , assuming an effective electron density of @xmath20  @xmath21 and 2  @xmath21 , respectively , to calculate the ionized gas densities from free - free emission intensities .",
    "the intermediate ( red ) dashed line shows the total ic expected if crs had the local interstellar spectrum across the cygnus x region , including emission from the tow major stellar clusters cyg  ob2 ( upper black dotted line ) and ngc  6910 ( lower black dotted line ) , as well as from the enhanced optical and infrared radiation fields pervading the cygnus  x cavities ( lower dashed line ) . from @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the @xmath1-ray spectrum of the cocoon with predictions based on the _ local _ cr spectrum , i.e. the cr spectrum in the interstellar space near the earth inferred from direct cr measurements , @xmath1-ray observations of nearby clouds and radio observations of synchrotron emission produced by cr electrons and positrons .",
    "such predictions fail to reproduce the observed @xmath1-ray spectrum . if we assume that the emission is purely hadronic we need to amplify the _",
    "local _ proton and helium spectra by @xmath22 .",
    "if we assume that it is purely leptonic we need an amplification factor of @xmath23 for the _ local _ cr electron and positron spectrum .",
    "the hardness of the @xmath1-ray spectrum points to freshly - accelerated particles since the lifetime of tev electrons in the enhanced radiation environment of the cocoon is @xmath24  kyr and the escape time for @xmath25  tev nuclei is @xmath26  kyr for the average galactic diffusion coefficient .",
    "the @xmath1  cygni snr is one of the potential sites where the young crs might have been accelerated .",
    "the shockwave still shelters energetic particles shining in @xmath1-rays .",
    "cr acceleration models ( taking into account cr pressure and magnetic feedback ) show that , based on the shockwave properties inferred from optical and x - ray observations , @xmath1  cygni may have released protons up to 80300  tev and electrons up to 630  tev at the end of the the free - expansion phase approximately 5 kyrs ago .",
    "if the dominant particle transport mechanism were diffusion , and the diffusion coefficient were similar to that in the galaxy at large , particles released by @xmath1  cygni at that time could fill the whole cocoon . yet",
    ", there is no proof of a physical link between the snr and the cygnus  x cavities .",
    "moreover , the anisotropy of the particle release with respect to the remnant ( fig .  [ morph ] ) , as well as the comparable extension of the @xmath1-ray emission at different energies , would point to an advection - dominated scenario instead of diffusive transport , but there is no proof either that the shockwave breaks free on its western rim adjacent to the cocoon . in the absence of advection",
    "the short diffusion lengths expected from the high magnetic turbulence level in the cygnus  x region could rule out the young @xmath1  cygni remnant as the only source of energetic particles in the cocoon .",
    "superbubbles created by the collective action of snr and stellar wind shockwaves are considered as potential cr accelerators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the few myr old clusters in cygnus  x have had time to produce very few snrs , if any .",
    "the total @xmath1-ray luminosity of the cocoon above 1  gev , @xmath27 at 1.4  kpc , however , represents only @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the mechanical power injected by stellar winds in cygnus  ob2 and ngc  6910 , respectively .",
    "wind - powered turbulence in the high - pressure gas within the cocoon , with a typical energy - containing scale of 10  pc , can efficiently confine and accelerate particles . with near - saturation turbulence and a regular magnetic field of 2  nt ( in pressure balance with the gas ) the particle energy distribution",
    "would peak at 10100  gev and potentially extend up to 150  tev . for a typical dimension of @xmath30",
    "pc the turbulence would scatter tev particles for more than 100  kyr , in agreement with the timescale inferred from the lack of @xmath31ni revealed by direct cr measurements @xcite .",
    "a @xmath1-ray excess revealed the presence of a cocoon of freshly - accelerated crs over a scale of @xmath30  pc in the heart of cygnus  x. the average cr population of the whole cygnus interstellar complex , over a scale of @xmath32  pc , was probed by the @xmath8 emissivity , i.e. the @xmath1-ray emission rate per hydrogen atom , which is derived in the fit of the background model to the lat data .    in fig .",
    "[ hispec ] we compare the @xmath8 emissivity spectrum of the cygnus complex with the model for the _ local _ interstellar spectrum that was shown to be in good agreement with lat measurements of diffuse @xmath1-ray emission from gas within 1  kpc from the sun @xcite .",

    "points include statistical uncertainties only , whereas the dashed bands show the systematic uncertainties related to the @xmath8 column densities and to the lat effective area .",

    "no counterpart to the broad excess of @xmath1-ray emission seen at energies @xmath33  tev at @xmath34 @xcite was detected by the lat so far .",
    "only the molecular clouds closer to the central star - forming region show a hint of a younger cr population from a slight spectral hardening at energies @xmath33  gev ( * ? ? ?",
    "this points again to an efficient confinement of the particles inside the cocoon .    in fig .",

    "unless we invoke the presence of large amounts of missing gas in the outer galaxy , models assuming a uniform cr diffusion throughout the galaxy would require a very large propagation halo or the presence of unknown cr sources in the outer galaxy to reproduce the lat data @xcite . on the other hand , the strong turbulence associated with the stellar clusters and cr acceleration can increase the diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the galactic disk , hence make the escape of crs faster and wash out the cr density around their sources @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _  lat observations of cygnus have added a few more pieces to the puzzle of galactic crs .",
    "the discovery of a cocoon of freshly - accelerated crs in cygnus  x confirms the long - standing hypothesis that massive - star forming regions house particle accelerators .",

    "studies of _ fermi _  @xmath1-ray observations of massive star - forming complexes in the inner galaxy are required to further investigate this issue .",
