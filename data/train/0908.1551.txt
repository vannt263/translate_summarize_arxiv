    "at the time of the outburst all points within the ball that are not yet infected get @xmath8-infected .",
    "we note that the @xmath8-infected region @xmath6 is increasing in @xmath11 , and at any given time @xmath11 the sets @xmath17 are disjoint .",

    "+ an interesting question for the cr - model  is that of coexistence : do all infection types grow unboundedly at the same time with positive probability ? in the 2-type cr - model",

    "the aim of the present article is to show how these extra assumptions can be avoided .",
    "( in fact it turns out that assuming condition is sufficient . ) as an immediate consequence the aforementioned coexistence results extend to basically all initial configurations for all radius distributions satisfying .",

    "if we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 , the possibility of coexistence does nt depend on the initial condition : @xmath47    we note that the condition on the events @xmath36 merely states that in the initial configurations no type strangles the other . as mentioned above",
