    "discoveries of new degrees of freedom at tev energy scale , with contributions to our understanding of the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking , can proceed in two different ways .",
    "one is a direct search of the higgs boson , the last piece to complete the standard model ( sm ) , and particles beyond the sm , to establish new physics ( np ) theories .",
    "the other effort , already ongoing , is to investigate processes in which sm is tested with higher experimental and theoretical precision . among the latter category ,",
    "rare @xmath7 decays are among ideal probes .",
    "besides constraints on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix including apexs and angles of the unitary triangle , which have been contributed by semileptonic @xmath8 and nonleptonic @xmath7 decays respectively , the electroweak interaction structure can also be probed by , for instance , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes which are induced by loop effects in the sm and therefore sensitive to the np interactions .",
    "unlike @xmath9 and @xmath11 that has only limited physical observables , @xmath4 especially @xmath12 , with a number of observables accessible , provides a wealth of information of weak interactions , ranging from the forward - backward asymmetries ( fbas ) , isospin symmetries , polarizations to a full angular analysis . the last barrier to access this mode , the low statistic with a branching faction of the order @xmath13 ,",
    "is being cleared by the @xmath7 factories and the hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "the ongoing lhcb experiment can accumulate @xmath14 events per nominal running year of @xmath15 with @xmath16 tev  @xcite , which allows to probe the short - distance physics at an unprecedented level .",
    "for instance the sensitivity to zero - crossing point of fbas can be reduced to @xmath17 and might be further improved as @xmath18 after the upgrade  @xcite .",
    "this provides a good sensitivity to discriminate between the sm and different models of new physics .",
    "there are also a lot of opportunities on the super b factory  @xcite .",
    "because of these virtues , theoretical research interests in this mode have exploded and the precision is highly improved , see refs .",
    "@xcite for an incomplete list .    toward the direction to elucidate the electroweak interaction , @xmath3 and its su(3)-related mode @xmath19 are not unique . in this work",
    ", we shall point out that @xmath20 and the @xmath21-counterpart @xmath22   and @xmath23 to abbreviate @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "] , which so far have not been investigated in detail  @xcite , are also useful in several aspects . due to",
    "the similarities between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , all experiment techniques for @xmath3 are adjustable to @xmath5 .",
    "the main decay product of @xmath27 is a pair of charged kaon and pion which are easily detected on the lhcb .",
    "moreover as we will show in the following , based on either a direct computation in the perturbative qcd approach  @xcite or the implication of experimental data on @xmath28 process , the branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath29 is found sizable .",
    "therefore thousands of signal events can be accumulated on the lhcb per nominal running year .    as a consequence of the unitarity of quark mixing matrix",
    ", tree level flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) is forbidden in the sm . when higher order corrections are taken into account",
    ", @xmath4 arises from photonic penguin , z penguin and w - box diagram .",
    "the large mass scale of virtual states leads to tiny wilson coefficients in @xmath30 quark decays and thus @xmath4 would be sensitive to the potential np effects",
    ". in certain np scenarios , new effective operators out of the sm scope can emerge , but in a class of other scenarios , only wilson coefficients for effective operators are modified . among the latter category , vector - like quark model ( vqm )  @xcite and family non - universal @xmath2 model  @xcite are simplest and therefore of theoretical interest . in this work",
    "we shall also elaborate the impacts of these models on @xmath5 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section : elements ] , we collect the necessary hadronic inputs , namely form factors . sec .",
    "ii contains the analytic formulas for differential decay distributions and integrated quantities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two - np - models ] , we give a brief overview of two np models whose effects we will study .",
    "v is our phenomenological analysis : the predictions in the sm ; update of the constraints on the vqm and @xmath2 model parameters ; the np effect on the physical quantities .",
    "we conclude in the last section . in the appendix",
    ", we give the effective hamiltonian in the sm and the helicity amplitude method .",
    "@xmath5 decay amplitudes contain two separate parts .",
    "short - distance physics , in which contributions at the weak scale @xmath32 is calculated by perturbation theory and the evolution between @xmath33 and @xmath30 quark mass scale @xmath34 is organized by the renormalization group .",
    "these degrees of freedom are incorporated into wilson coefficients and the obtained effective hamiltonian responsible for @xmath4 in the appendix a. the low - energy effect characterizes the long - distance physics and will be parameterized by hadronic matrix elements of effective operators , which are usually reduced to heavy - to - light form factors in semileptonic @xmath7 decays .",
    "the spin-2 polarization tensor , which satisfies @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the momentum , is symmetric and traceless .",
    "it can be constructed via the spin-1 polarization vector @xmath37 : @xmath38,\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu}(0)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt6 }   [ \\epsilon_{\\mu}(+)\\epsilon_\\nu(-)+\\epsilon_{\\nu}(+)\\epsilon_\\mu(- ) ]   + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\epsilon_{\\mu}(0)\\epsilon_\\nu(0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of the tensor meson moving on the @xmath39 axis , the explicit structures of @xmath37 in the ordinary coordinate frame are chosen as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the energy and the momentum magnitude of @xmath43 in @xmath7 meson rest frame , respectively . in the following calculation , it is convenient to introduce a new polarization vector @xmath44 @xmath45 which satisfies @xmath46 the contraction is evaluated as @xmath47 and thus we can see that the new vector @xmath44 plays a similar role to the ordinary polarization vector @xmath37 , regardless of the dimensionless constants @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",

    "using the newly - studied light - cone distribution amplitudes  @xcite , we have computed @xmath50 form factors  @xcite in the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd )  @xcite . at the leading power , our predictions are found to obey the nontrivial relations derived from the large energy symmetry .",
    "this consistence may imply that the pqcd results for the form factors are reliable and therefore suitable for the study of the semileptonic @xmath7 decays .",
    "the recent computation in light - cone qcd sum rules  @xcite is also consistent with ours .",
    "results in the light - cone sum rules in conjunction with @xmath7-meson wave functions  @xcite , however , are too large and thus not favored by the @xmath56 data . in our work the @xmath50 form factors are @xmath57-distributed as  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes a generic form factor among @xmath60 . neglecting higher power corrections , @xmath61 is related to @xmath62 and @xmath63 by @xmath64.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] numerical results for the @xmath50 and @xmath65 form factors at maximally recoil point and the two fitted parameters @xmath66 are collected in table  [ tab : formfactors ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at the one - loop level accuracy , the matrix element of @xmath4 transition receives loop contributions from @xmath72 .",
    "since the factorizable loop terms  @xcite can be incorporated into the wilson coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 , it is convenient to define combinations @xmath75 and @xmath76  @xcite @xmath77 with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the auxiliary functions used above are @xmath81 in the following , we shall also drop the superscripts for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for convenience .    on the hadron level resonant states , such as vector charmonia generated from the @xmath84 ,",
    "may annihilate into a lepton pair .",
    "therefore they will also contribute in a long distance manner  @xcite .",
    "but these contributions can be subtracted with a kinematic cutoff in experiment .",
    "moreover our following analysis of differential distributions will be mainly dedicated to the region of @xmath85 , also excluding contributions from the charmonia .",
    "within a graphic picture @xmath0 proceeds via three steps : @xmath7 meson first decays into an onshell strange meson plus a pair of leptons ; the @xmath27 meson propagates followed by its strong decay into @xmath86 . to evaluate the decay width of multibody decays",
    ", we shall adopt the helicity amplitude which mainly uses @xmath87 @xmath37 is the polarization vector with the momentum @xmath88 and @xmath89 denotes the three kinds of polarizations .",
    "the last term can be formally identified as a timelike polarization @xmath90 , and thus the metric tensor @xmath91 can be then understood as summations of the four polarizations . for the purpose of illustration we will first evaluate the decay amplitude of @xmath5 . in the sm , the lepton pair in the final state is produced via an off - shell photon , a @xmath92 boson or some hadronic vector mesons .",
    "these states may have different couplings but they share many commonalities : the lorentz structure for the vertex of the lepton pair is either @xmath93 or @xmath94 or some combination of them .",
    "therefore the decay amplitudes of @xmath95 can be rewritten as @xmath96 in which @xmath97 are the lepton pair spinor products : @xmath98 while @xmath99 incorporates the remaining @xmath50 part . in the case of massless leptons ,",
    "left - handed and right - handed sectors decouple , which will greatly simplify the analysis . the identity in eq .",
    "results in a factorization of decay amplitudes @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the momentum of the lepton pair and @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote lorentz invariant amplitudes for the lepton part .",
    "it is also similar for the lorentz invariant hadronic amplitudes : @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the timelike polarization gives vanishing contributions in the case of @xmath106 for @xmath107 : using equation of motion , this term is proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "an advantage of the helicity amplitudes is that both hadronic amplitudes and leptonic amplitudes are lorentz invariant .",
    "such a good property allows to choose different frames in the evaluation .",
    "for instance leptonic amplitudes are evaluated in the lepton pair central mass frame , while hadronic @xmath7 decay amplitudes are directly obtained in the @xmath7 rest frame . since @xmath27 and @xmath26 have several important similarities , @xmath5 differential decay widths can be simply obtained from the ones of @xmath3 in a comparative manner .    *",
