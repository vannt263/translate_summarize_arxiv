    "the goal of this paper is to investigate some properties of the solution and the free boundary arising from pricing convertible bonds with the additional call feature , by pde methods .",
    "but first we overview some basic financial notions , we are dealing with , in this paper .",
    "_ bond _ is a contract which is paid in advance and yields a specified amount on a known date , which is usually called maturity ( expiry ) date .",
    "it is commonly issued by the government or major companies that can guarantee the pay back of the predetermined amount to the holder , on the maturity date .",
    "bonds may also pay a known cash dividend , commonly named coupon , at intervals up to and including the maturity time .",
    "face value for a bond ( par value ) refers to the amount paid to the holder at the maturity time . in this paper",
    "we shall take the face value to be @xmath0 .",
    "_ convertible bond _ is a bond that entitles the holder the right to convert it into an agreed - upon amount of the company stock or asset , usually at any time of the holder s selection and sometimes at certain times during its lifespan .",
    "_ call feature _ refers to the issuing company s right to buy back the bond for an amount @xmath0 ; it is by intention we have taken the face value and the call value equal . clearly , the price of the convertible bond @xmath1 is less than this amount , i.e. , @xmath2 ( otherwise arbitrage to the benefit of the bank will take place ) .",
    "a convertible bond with call feature is worth less than a standard one .",
    "let @xmath3 be the price of the stock at time @xmath4 . consider a portfolio , consisting of being long one convertible bond and short a number @xmath5 of the stock at time @xmath4",
    ", @xmath6 suppose that the stock price follows a lognormal random walk , @xmath7 , where , @xmath8 is the volatility of the stock , and @xmath9 indicates the interest rate and @xmath10 is a wiener process .",
    "applying ito s formula , one can derive the changes in portfolio s value @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the coupon payment of the bond and the dividend of the stock respectively ( see @xcite for more detailed calculation ) .",
    "since the return should be at most that of a bank deposit and according to the fact that @xmath14 , we conclude @xmath15 in order to have a risk - free portfolio , using @xmath16hedging we consider @xmath17 .",
    "therefore @xmath18 with the terminal condition @xmath19 on the other hand , at any time prior to expiry , the bond may be exchanged into @xmath20 number of shares , so @xmath21 where @xmath20 is called conversion factor .",
    "furthermore when the stock price moves up , it is apparent that the bondholder s will is to convert the bond into the pre - determined number of shares rather than getting the face value on the expiry date ; @xmath22 conversely if there is no underlying asset , i.e. , @xmath23 , then the bond value satisfies the equation @xmath24 with termination value @xmath25 , and hence admits a solution @xmath26 even though this seems obvious from a financial point of view , we can not claim this from a pde point of view ( at least it is not straightforward ) .",
    "such a claim involves a verification of @xmath27 for a solution to our problem .",
    "this in general may fail . in this paper",
    "we shall consider solution only in a class with property ( [ bdry - regul-0 ] ) .",
    "this fact ( or mentioning of it ) is ignored many times in the existing literature .",
    "we shall use the following notations in this paper .",
    "@xmath28      let the operator @xmath29 be as follows @xmath30 we shall consider the convertible bond with the extra call feature . if @xmath0 is the call price , set by the firm , then theoretically we have @xmath31    hence we have the following two constraint variational inequality @xmath32 where @xmath33 . to give meanings to the above equations we shall look for solutions @xmath1 in the class @xmath34",
    "observe that taking the equation in this sense forces a smooth fit along the free boundary @xmath35 . from a financial point of view",
    "it is natural to assume that the value function @xmath1 should be continuously differentiable in order to avoid arbitrage . from a pde point of view",
    "this falls out naturally when variational formulation is considered @xmath36 where the equation is in appropriate sense ( weak or viscosity ) and with the boundary values as above .",
    "it is however not our intention to discuss such aspects of this problem here , but rather pay attention to the qualitative behavior of the free boundary when ( and if ) it approaches the fixed boundary @xmath37 . from the variational inequality approach  or any other for that matter one",
    "always obtains the fact that @xmath38 in @xmath39 . a very good source for such problems from both stochastic and variational point of view",
    "is avner friedman s book @xcite , chapter 16 .",
    "it should be remarked that in the above setting we did not assign boundary values to the characteristic boundary @xmath23 , due to the degeneracy of the equation at such points .",
    "degenerate points are treated by the problem as interior points and one can not assign boundary data ; see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , using the assumption ( [ bdry - regul ] ) , the value at @xmath23 can be computed directly from the equation , as we did above ( see ( [ termination ] ) ) @xmath40 one can also treat the problem by considering a regularization of the equation in @xmath41 where in the set @xmath42 we consider the evenly reflected coefficients of the operator , which amounts to @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    in this new setting",
    "the problem admits a solution ( call it @xmath45 ) and by uniqueness and symmetry of the problem , the solution is symmetric in @xmath46-variable , and hence @xmath47 now if we have enough regularity for solutions we may let @xmath48 tend to zero to obtain a solution to our original problem . indeed , such uniform estimates for @xmath45 in compact sets of @xmath49 is true by classical theory for uniformly parabolic equations .",
    "this convergence is not obvious on the boundary @xmath50 .",
    "in particular we _ can not _ claim that @xmath51 , at least not without any further analysis .",
    "property ( [ wx ] ) will be used in proving that the function @xmath1 is monotone increasing in @xmath46-variable but grows slower than @xmath52 .",
    "see proposition [ t1 ] .",
    "another approach to existence of this type of degenerate problem is the use of a mapping that send the origin to @xmath53 , so that the degeneracy appears at infinity point .",
    "then by solving the problem in finite domains , and letting the domain enlarge to the whole space one obtains a solution .",
    "[ as ] throughout the paper we shall assume certain conditions to be fulfilled .",
    "these conditions force the problem to behave correctly , in a certain sense that is crucial for the problem ; e.g. standard maximum principle , uniqueness , compactness should be available .",
    "these conditions will in general lead us to existence , uniqueness and qualitative properties which are expected .",
    "it should be mentioned that , as we shall discuss it later , these assumptions fall natural for the problem from a financial standpoint . for parabolic",
    "pde we refer to @xcite as a general background reference .",
    "* call feature : the call feature , as we explained above , determines the region @xmath54 where the equations take place .",
    "* we shall also assume @xmath55 .",
    "this assumption forces the value function @xmath1 to stay strictly below @xmath0 and hence the upper - obstacle never takes place in @xmath49 .",
    "this can , indeed , be seen from equation ( [ 1 ] ) . since in the set",
    "@xmath56 we would then have @xmath57 contradicting the assumption @xmath58 .",
    "it should however be remarked that this assumption does not affect the general results in this paper since if @xmath59 one may consider the obstacle problem with upper obstacle only .",
    "when these ingredients vary in @xmath60 and @xmath61 changes sign , then the techniques in this paper has to be modified substantially .",
    "* we shall further assume that @xmath62 otherwise there would be no touch between the graph of @xmath1 and that of @xmath52 , i.e. , no free boundary .",
    "this can be seen from equation ( [ lower - bound ] ) below .",
    "indeed from ( [ lower - bound ] ) we have @xmath63 so for @xmath46 on the free boundary we have this condition as well , and therefore @xmath64 . on the other hand if @xmath65 then @xmath66 and therefore @xmath46 is outside the region @xmath49 .    in most literatures",
    "there is an extra assumption @xmath67 , which addresses the fact that if dividend rate are higher than interest rate then no body will invest in the bond market .",
    "since we are just dealing with the case in which @xmath68 , when @xmath1 is strictly smaller than @xmath0 , we may skip the upper obstacle in the formulation of the problem .",
    "also the variational problem produces a supersolution to the pde and therefore @xmath69 holds in @xmath70 .",
    "we thus look into the following equations of variational inequalities @xmath71 with a smooth fit along the free boundary ( see proposition [ t1 ] for more explanation ) . in other words our solution to the above problem will be @xmath72 , and the corresponding sobolev spaces are @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "( -110,125)@xmath75 ( -98,144)@xmath4 ( 0,5)@xmath46 ( -12,106)@xmath76 ( -23,-8)@xmath77    an interesting way of thinking is the fact that black - scholes formula determines the value of the bond not only for the current and future times , but it can also evaluate the bond in the past , i.e. , for @xmath78 .    in the following proposition the existence and the uniqueness of the solution is formulated and then we show the monotonicity and regularity in both @xmath4 and @xmath46 directions .",
    "[ t1 ] there exists a solution @xmath79 , @xmath80 to problem ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the solution is unique in the class of all solutions with @xmath81 and satisfies @xmath82 consequently , in this class we also have that the exercise region ( if non - empty ) is an epi - graph in both @xmath46 and @xmath4 directions .",
    "although the statements of this theorem is well - known to experts , and is considered as `` common property '' , we shall sketch a proof of it in section [ pr ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in most known literatures the assumption ( [ bdry - regul ] ) is not taken into account and this may cause serious problems .",
    "this assumption , however , can be relaxed to boundedness and then uniqueness will be in the class of variational solutions .    an important feature for convertible bonds",
    "is the presence of the free boundary , and the so - called exercise region @xmath83 .",
    "if one chooses the ingredients in the problem in a way that conversion is never optimal then this falls under standard theory of bonds .",
    "we shall avoid such a discussion here , but we assume from now on that @xmath84    once we agree upon condition ( [ lambda ] ) then we need to make sure that the touching point between the free boundary and the fixed boundary @xmath85 exists as well as it does not come too close to the termination point @xmath86 .    [",
    "pro ] in problem ( [ 1 ] ) , there is @xmath87 such that the free boundary @xmath88 , hits the fixed boundary only at @xmath89 and at no other fixed boundary point .    to not digress from the discussion , we shall prove this proposition later in section ( [ pr ] ) .    in problem (",
    "[ 1 ] ) , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . moreover @xmath92 ( see theorem [ t3 ] ) , hence for every @xmath46 there is a @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 from here we deduce that there is a certain distance between @xmath76 ( in proposition [ pro ] ) and the maturity date , more exactly @xmath95",
    "in this section we shall state our main results concerning qualitative behavior of the solution to problem ( [ 1 ] ) and the free boundary arising from it .",
    "the proofs are also gathered in the next section .",
    "the following theorem states the optimal smoothness of the solution to problem ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "[ t3]the solution @xmath1 to problem ( [ 1 ] ) is uniformly @xmath96 in @xmath97 .",
    "finally we state a theorem , which shows that the free boundary is situated outside the set @xmath98 .",
    "in other words , it is located under any arbitrary downward parabola at the point @xmath99 and after scaling it tends to the line @xmath37 .",
    "[ t4 ] the free boundary @xmath100 in problem ( [ 1 ] ) , is uniformly parabolically tangential to the fixed boundary at @xmath101 . in other words",
    "there is a modulus of continuity @xmath8 ( @xmath102 ) and an @xmath103 such that @xmath104    the reader should notice that theorem [ t4 ] implies that a parabolic scaling @xmath105 of the free boundary at @xmath106 gives that the limiting free boundary @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 is the scaled free boundary ) will coincide with the @xmath4-axis .",
    "* it is notable that the free boundary arising from the american option behaves in a completely different way , i.e. , it is located above all arbitrary parabolas and after scaling it tends to the spatial axis . *",
    "a final remark concerning theorem [ t4 ] is that here we have intentionally avoided to discuss the regularity of the free boundary due to technical reasons . indeed",
    ", one expects the free boundary in this case to be smooth ( up to @xmath109 ) but a proof of this `` fact '' needs detailed analysis and blow - up techniques .",
    "there are several papers treating regularity of the free boundary for the american put / call option and it would be likely that these methods apply here , even though not directly . such a sketch of ideas is presented in @xcite . * we want to further remark that all estimates and statements in our main results , hold in a uniform fashion .",
    "more exactly the constants in our theorems above depend only on the norms of the ingredients and not the ingredients themselves .",
    "nevertheless we shall only do the proof for one solutions and not a general class of solutions , as it would require more definitions and complications .",
    "in this section we shall make change of variables so that the main equation falls under general theory of parabolic pde .",
    "we shall also state some general facts from the standard theory of the free boundary regularity , for parabolic equations ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "+    [ dis ] for the sake of simplicity first we translate @xmath1 to @xmath110 by @xmath111 inserting this in equation ( [ 1 ] ) , gives    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the following operator @xmath114 one may also derive from ( [ termination ] ) @xmath115 the obstacle should also be transformed and it becomes @xmath116 .",
    "now for @xmath117 we have @xmath118 in the set @xmath119 moreover @xmath120 satisfies the following problem @xmath121 one also observes that from ( [ x=0 ] ) we have @xmath122    we also define a scaled operator @xmath123 and its corresponding scaled function @xmath124 at the point @xmath125 , for some fixed @xmath126 , also in the forthcoming proofs , @xmath127 will either be @xmath128 or @xmath129 , dependent on the situation .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath130     ( -127,25)@xmath131    [ lem1 ] the solution @xmath120 to problem ( [ 3 ] ) satisfies @xmath132 along with the boundary conditions @xmath133    the proof follows now easily due to smoothness of the function @xmath134 locally in @xmath49 , and the equations in ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "[ l1 ] ( non - degeneracy for parabolic equations ) [ nd ] let @xmath120 be a solution of problem ( [ transf - eq1])-([transf - eq2 ] ) , then @xmath135 for all @xmath136 .",
    "the proof of non - degeneracy is quite standard and it follows by simple maximum principle ( see @xcite ) . in this particular case with",
    "@xmath137 we can not apply the proof for elliptic case ( as is standard for american put / call options ) ; cf .",
    "@xcite lemma 2.2 .",
    "we shall present another proof by defining @xmath138 in the cylinder @xmath139 .",
    "let further @xmath140 be chosen appropriately to have @xmath141 , so that @xmath142 is a sub - solution to the variational problem locally in @xmath139 .",
    "now if @xmath143 on the parabolic boundary @xmath144 then @xmath143 on @xmath139 .",
    "in particular if @xmath145 then we arrive at the contradiction @xmath146 . by continuity",
    "we may let @xmath147 tend to a free boundary point so that the lemma holds for all points in the set @xmath148 .",
    "the idea of the proof of this lemma appeared in a paper by g.s .",
    "weiss ( see appendix in @xcite ) for the elliptic case .",
    "we split the proof in cases , according to statement .",
    "the proofs being standard , we shall only sketch the ideas .",
    "we shall also consider the problem for the translated function @xmath149 .",
    "_ existence _ : + to prove the existence of the solution , one can utilize the regularization / penalization or perron s method , this is standard and follows from various literature , e.g. @xcite , also see @xcite .",
    "observe that due to degeneracy of the pde one needs more care in this part , that the usual uniformly elliptic / parabolic case .",
    "therefore an approximation of the problem to a uniformly parabolic problem or alternatively a domain change by a transformation will be needed .",
    "_ partial regularity _ : this is also quite classical and one can easily prove ( local ) @xmath150 regularity in the literatures .",
    "it should be noticed that once the reformulation of the problem as in lemma [ lem1 ] is done then one obtains standard parabolic equation with bounded right - hand side .",
    "classical pde then tells us that the solution is @xmath150 , for any @xmath151 .",
    "observe that without the assumption ( [ bdry - regul ] ) one can not obtain such regularities up to the boundary @xmath152 using classical techniques .",
    "_ uniqueness _ : + to show the uniqueness of the solution , we suppose that there exist two solutions @xmath153 and @xmath154 to problem ( [ 2 ] ) and define the set @xmath155 as follows @xmath156 we have @xmath157 in @xmath155 , hence @xmath158 in @xmath155 .",
    "moreover @xmath159 , i.e. , @xmath160 is a super - solution to the equation and therefore we can use the comparison principle ( see @xcite and @xcite ) to conclude that @xmath161 in @xmath155 , which leads us to a contradiction . observe that in the above argument we may use the values at @xmath37 , as both solutions should have the same ( non - assigned ) value at @xmath37 ; see ( [ x=0 ] ) .",
    "_ monotonicity _ : + in order to prove the monotonicity in @xmath4-direction we slide the solution @xmath110 slightly in @xmath4-direction and obtain @xmath162 @xmath163 we want to show @xmath164 , in @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
    "we have ( by inspections ) @xmath167 on the boundary of @xmath165 ( where we may also use the value ( [ x=0 ] ) ) and therefore according to comparison principle ( see the uniqueness part ) we can deduce that @xmath167 in the domain @xmath165 . observe that the operator does not change , while shifting in @xmath4-direction as the coefficients are independent of @xmath4 .    for the monotonicity in @xmath46-direction ,",
    "a similar slide in @xmath46-direction does not work , since the operator will change .",
    "we may does apply the maximum / minimum principle to @xmath168 ( introduced earlier , see ( [ wx ] ) ) in the continuation ( non - coincidence set ) for @xmath45 .",
    "we first consider @xmath169 from ( [ wx ] ) in the region @xmath49 , and observe that @xmath170 .",
    "next we apply the maximum principle to the equation @xmath171 in the region @xmath172 , and observe that @xmath173 satisfies @xmath174 in the region @xmath175 ; compare ( [ l - operator ] ) .",
    "on @xmath176 we have by ( [ wx ] ) that @xmath177 , and for @xmath178 as well as for @xmath179 we have @xmath180 . finally on @xmath23 with @xmath181",
    "we have @xmath182 .",
    "the last inequality depends on the fact that @xmath183 .",
    "the maximum and minimum principle both apply and we obtain @xmath184 .",
    "this naturally shows that the coincidence set ( exercise region ) for the @xmath185-problem is an epi - graph .",
    "as @xmath185 tends to zero , @xmath45 tends to @xmath1 and we obtain the same properties for @xmath1 and its graph .",
    "we recall from ( [ lambda ] ) that the @xmath186 . by monotonicity of @xmath1 in both @xmath46 and @xmath4-directions ( proposition [ t1 ] )",
    "we conclude that the set @xmath83 is connected , and its boundary is an epi - graph , in both spatial and time directions .",
    "in particular @xmath187 ( closure of the interior ) .",
    "hence @xmath188 .",
    "since @xmath189 in the interior of @xmath83 we may differentiate to obtain @xmath190 implementing these in equation @xmath191 gives @xmath192 .",
    "therefore @xmath193 for all points in the interior of @xmath83 .",
    "hence there exists a lower bound for @xmath194 , i.e. , @xmath195 this shows that the free boundary can not touch the time axis .",
    "next , if @xmath83 reaches all the way to @xmath86 , with @xmath196 , then @xmath197 and in @xmath198 we have @xmath199 , the continuity of @xmath1 breaks down , contradicting proposition [ t1 ] .",
    "from both arguments above we conclude that the free boundary neither touches the @xmath4-axis , nor any point on @xmath86 , with @xmath200 .",
    "we need now to exclude the point @xmath201 .",
    "this is a little bit more tricky and one should use a higher regularity of @xmath1 up to the corner points .",
    "it is in general well - known that variational problems produce the same amount of regularity for the solutions as that of the given obstacle in @xmath46-variable and half regularity in @xmath4-variable ( but @xmath202 is in general a regularity threshold ) .",
    "in particular @xmath203 exists and is continuous up to the boundary , including the point @xmath201 .",
    "this implies in turn that on one side @xmath204 ( derivative along the segment @xmath86 ) and on the other side @xmath205 ( derivative along the segment @xmath37 ) . this is a contradiction , and",
    "hence there is a @xmath206 such that @xmath207 .",
    "we first notice that due to ( [ t * ] ) , ( [ lower - bound ] ) and the monotonicity of the @xmath1 ( proposition [ t1 ] ) , the function @xmath1 solves an standard parabolic equation in the set @xmath208 hence we can conclude by classical parabolic theory that the @xmath1 is as smooth as stated in the theorem , up to the fixed boundary ( the ingredients are smooth enough ) .",
    "next we will prove the following lemma , which says that if the solutions grows quadratically from the free boundary then one can after rescaling obtain uniform regularity as stated in theorem [ t3 ] .",
    "we state the lemma in terms of the function @xmath120 , i.e. , a solution to equation ( [ 3 ] ) , or more exactly a solution to ( [ transf - eq1])- ( [ transf - eq2 ] ) .",
    "let us now introduce some notations : @xmath209 @xmath210 @xmath211    [ lem2 ] under the assumptions of theorem [ t3 ] , let @xmath120 be a solution of equation ( [ transf - eq1])- ( [ transf - eq2 ] ) .",
    "suppose also that for @xmath212 @xmath213 for all @xmath214 , and a universal @xmath215 independent of the ingredients in the equations .",
    "then @xmath216 where the norm depends only on the norms of the ingredients .",

    "define @xmath222 by ( [ growth - u ] ) we have @xmath223 here @xmath224 is the closest point to @xmath225 on the free boundary .",
    "now @xmath10 being bounded in @xmath226 and @xmath227 we can apply interior schauder estimate , to arrive at @xmath228 on the other hand @xmath229 and @xmath230 , which implies @xmath231 as stated in the lemma .    to prove theorem [ t3 ] we shall only need to show the growth estimate ( [ growth - u ] ) for small @xmath232 , as the estimate holds for @xmath233 .",
    "the proof of estimate ( [ growth - u ] ) will follow using the well - known scaling method and blow - up technique , standard in recent theory of free boundary regularity ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",

    "suppose this is true , then we see that ( [ growth - u ] ) follows by inspection .",
    "indeed , for any @xmath239 ( small ) we may choose @xmath240 such that @xmath241 . from ( [ s_j ] ) then it follows that @xmath242 .",

    "next for any @xmath262 , there is a @xmath263 such that @xmath264 and by using equation ( [ s_j ] ) we have @xmath265 therefore @xmath266 s are uniformly bounded in any compact subset of @xmath267 . since the operators @xmath268 are also uniformly elliptic ( in @xmath269 but away from @xmath270 ) and @xmath266 satisfying the equation ( [ eq - v ] ) and they are uniformly bounded by ( [ vn - uniform ] ) we conclude , by classical schauder theory , that they are uniformly @xmath271 in any compact subsets of @xmath267 .    in particular by compactness",
    "there is a subsequence ( relabeled with the same sequence ) such that @xmath272 where @xmath273 , and @xmath274 .    on the other",

    "it is also crucial to see that since @xmath282 and @xmath283 we have @xmath284 ( @xmath266 is a @xmath285 ) . by the fact that the compactness is in the space @xmath286 for a @xmath166 and",

    "now in the case @xmath291 above we have that the origin is an interior point of the set @xmath288 and @xmath292 takes a local minimum , which violates the minimum principle for caloric functions ( or parabolic pdes ) .",
    "when the limit in ( [ limit - value ] ) is zero then @xmath293 and here one can apply the hopf boundary point lemma ( see @xcite , lemma 2.6 ) to obtain a contradiction to ( [ hopf ] ) .      for",

    "all one needs is uniform behavior ( in their norm ) to have similar results .",
    "the standing conditions @xmath336 or / and @xmath337 may also be dropped but then a double obstacle may occur and if these value also change in time and stock - value @xmath46 then one may have too complicated situations as the bond value @xmath1 may touch both upper and lower obstacle and switch between them too many times .",

    "other aspects that may be subject for study , by our methods can be the case of convertible bonds with random interest and call feature . the problem now will become two space - dimensional and more delicate .",
