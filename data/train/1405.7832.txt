    "impact factor was first described in 1972 and the isi journal impact factor is today the leading indicator of journal influence @xcite , despite its weaknesses @xcite .",
    "the impact factor of a journal in a given year measures the average number of citations to recent articles from articles published in the given year .",
    "the conventional two - year impact factor is calculated based on citation data from a three - year period .",
    "for example , the impact factor of journal @xmath0 in 2014 is the ratio between the number of citations from all considered journals in source year 2014 to articles published in @xmath0 in target years 20122013 and the number of articles published in @xmath0 in the target years .",
    "a five - year impact factor is calculated in a similar way with a five - year target window .",
    "the advantage with the widely used impact factor is that it is easy to calculate and explain , once the selection of journals is made .",
    "even though impact factor is not seen as a flow - based metric , it is in fact an example of a zero - order markov model of flow between journals .",
    "the simple count of citations to journals corresponds to measuring the visit frequency of a random walker that visits journals proportional to their citation counts . while the measure is widely used , a major drawback is the underlying assumption that all citations carry equal weight , irrespective of origin .",
    "several rankings have been suggested to overcome the problem with uniform citation weights @xcite .",
    "the eigenfactor score @xcite and its per - article normalized article influence score , for example , builds on the pagerank algorithm @xcite and takes advantage of the entire network of citations . generally speaking , the eigenfactor score measures the relative journal visit rate of a random walker that navigates between journals by following random citations .",
    "therefore , the eigenfactor score of a journal can be interpreted as a proxy for how often a researcher who randomly navigates the citation landscape accesses content from the journal . in this way",
    ", the eigenfactor score corresponds to a first - order markov model for evaluating journal influence . in a recursive fashion ,",
    "important journals are those that are highly cited by important journals . in practice ,",
    "a citation from an influential journal will be worth more than a citation from a less significant journal , because its importance is inherited from the citing journal .",
    "however , the inherited importance is aggregated across a journal and pushed further no matter where it came from . as a result ,",
    "the actual inheritance structure of the article - level citation network is lost with strongest effect on multidisciplinary journals .",
    "while the main difference between impact factor and eigenfactor is that they correspond to a zero- and a first - order markov model of flow between journals , respectively , they differ in two other ways as well . first , while the conventional impact factor uses a two - year citation target window , eigenfactor uses a five - year target window by default .",
    "the extended time window was introduced because , in many fields , articles are not frequently cited until several years after publication .",
    "moreover , the eigenfactor score considers inheritance of importance _ between _ journals and therefore ignores self - citations . as a result ,",
    "the incentive to boost the ranking of a journal with self - citations vanishes . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the general effects of markov order rather than specific implementations .",
    "therefore , we exclusively study rankings with five - year target windows and exclude all self - citations .",
    "to model citation flows between journals , we first aggregate article - level citation data in journals and then model the network flow with a random walk process .",
    "we construct citation flows with different amounts of memory by aggregating the citation data in networks that correspond to zero- , first- , and second - order markov models .",
    "below we in turn describe how we aggregate the data and model the flow .",
    "we use article - level citation data from thomson reuters web of science 1980 - 2013 .",
    "the data include almost one billion citations between more than 30 million articles published in about 20,000 journals . in this study",
    ", we focus on articles published in the years 20072012 and their citations to articles published in 2002 - 2007 . specifically , we are interested in articles published in 2007 , their citations to articles published in 20022006 , and citations to the articles published in 2007 from articles published in 20082012 .",
    "we need the two overlapping time windows to construct the second - order markov model .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] illustrates how we construct journal citation networks with different amount of memory from article - level citation data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]a , we show a schematic citation network with articles published in 11 different journals .",
    "the articles were published in three different time periods , the early target years 20022007 , the early source year 2007 , which also is the target year of the late source years 20082012 . for the zero- and first - order markov models",
    ", we used the early target and source years 20022007 , and for the second - order markov model we also included the late source years 20082012 .",
    "we excluded proceedings , but included all journals @xmath1 that received citations during the target period .",
    "for the zero - order markov model , we counted the number of citations to articles published in the early target years 2002 - 2006 from articles published in the early source year 2007 . to construct the journal network",
    ", we aggregated these citations in the journals of the cited articles .",
    "that is , each citation @xmath2 between an article published in journal @xmath3 in the early source year to an article published in journal @xmath4 in the early target years , adds a weight of one to the cited journal @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "this procedure is exemplified in figs .",
    "[ fig : schematic]a and b , with articles published in the early target years in green and articles published in the early source year in blue .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic]a shows how one article published in journal 1 receives three citations , how four articles published in journal 3 receive eight citations , and how one article published in journal 4 receives two citations .",
    "for this zero - order markov network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]b , journals are connected to other journals with weights proportional to the number of incoming citations , independent of citation source .",
    "that is , a random walk process on a zero - order markov network is memoryless such that the next step does not depend on the currently visited journal .    for the first - order markov model",
    ", we aggregated the citations described above in pairs of citing and cited journals .",
    "that is , each citation between an article published in journal @xmath3 in the early source year to an article published in journal @xmath4 in the early target years adds a link weight of one between the citing and the cited journals , @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic]c illustrates how the 13 incoming links in the zero - order markov model have specific sources of the citing journals in the first - order markov model .",
    "accordingly , a random walk process on a first - order markov network has a one - step memory such that the next step depends on the currently visited journal .    for the second - order markov model",
    ", we also included citations from articles published in the late source years .",
    "we used citation chains @xmath7 , trigrams of articles published in journal @xmath8 in the late source years that cite articles in journal @xmath3 in the early source year that in turn cite articles in journal @xmath4 in the early target years , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]a . to construct the second - order markov network",
    ", we aggregated the trigrams in memory nodes @xmath9 , such that each citation chain @xmath7 adds a link weight of one between memory nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "that is , each journal has @xmath12 memory nodes , one for each other journal that cites it . constructed in this way , a random walk process on a second - order markov network has a two - step memory such that the next step depends not only on the currently visited journal , but also on the previously visited journal .",
    "the procedure to construct a second - order markov network above assumes that each article in the early source years only is cited by one journal in the later source years .",
    "for each citation from an article in journal @xmath3 in the early source year to an article in journal @xmath4 in the early target years @xmath13 , we identify all @xmath14 articles published in any journal @xmath8 in the late source years that cite the article in the early source year , and add a fractional link weight of @xmath15 between memory nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 . moreover , if we can not identify a trigram @xmath7 , because the article in the early source year was never cited by an article in the late source years , we add a fractional link weight @xmath16 between memory nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 for all @xmath12 memory nodes @xmath9 of journal @xmath3 . in this way , we obtain the first - order markov network if we aggregate the memory nodes in their respective journals .",
    "we use a random walk process on the networks with different amounts of memory to obtain the journal rankings .",
    "the random walk processes can be seen as proxies for how researchers navigate scholarly literature , as they read articles and follow citations in their search for information . in the zero - order markov model , a researcher would pick any citation and follow it to the cited journal irrespective of where the currently read article is published ( fig .

    "the random walk process generates a sequence of visited journals @xmath19 .",
    "in general , the journal visited at time @xmath20 depends on the full history of the dynamic process , @xmath21 but for the processes we consider here the memory is limited .",
    "for the zero - order markov model illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematicwalk]a , the probability to step to journal @xmath4 next is simply given by the relative number of citations to that journal irrespective of the currently visited journal , @xmath22 which therefore also is the stationary solution of the zero - order markov model , @xmath23    for the first - order markov model illustrated in fig .",

    "this link - weighted teleportation gives results that are more robust to changes in the teleportation rate @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we use teleportation rate @xmath29 in all analyses . note",
    "that this teleportation scheme is slightly different from the one used in eigenfactor @xcite .",
    "however , unrecorded teleportation to a journal proportional to the number of articles it publishes followed by a recorded first - order markov step , as used in eigenfactor , is approximately the same as a single recorded zero - order markov step .",

    "we normalize with respect to the average journal . in this way",
    ", a ranking score of a journal larger than one tells how many times higher the stationary distribution per article is compared with the average journal .",
    "the common framework for the three ranking models makes it easy to study effects of the markov order alone .",
    "however , the common framework also means that the models studied here are not identical to the established impact factor and eigenfactor , and conclusions should be treated with care even if the differences are small . in summary , unlike impact factor , we disregard all self - links , and unlike eigenfactor , we use recorded teleportation to journals proportional to their citation counts .",
    "in this section , we show the results of comparisons between ranking scores obtained with zero- , first- , and second - order markov models . we first show comparisons of the top journals in explicit ranking lists , and then show quantitative results for ranking scores and robustness .",

    "the ranking scores are given by the per article stationary distribution of random walkers normalized such that the average journal has score 1 , as described above .",

    "moreover , it is a trend that the higher - order markov models give wider range of scores .",
    "this effect can be explained by their non - uniform citations values ; citations from top ranked journals are worth more than citations from average ranked journals @xcite . in the second - order markov model with more detailed structural information and more specific re - distribution of flow value ,",
    "the range of scores is even wider .    ]",
    "figure  [ fig : distribution ] shows the cumulative journal frequency and ranking scores .",
    "the cumulative ranking scores show that the top 100 journals in the zero - order markov model share 15.9% of all flow , whereas the top 100 journals in the second - order markov model share 22.7% of all flow .",
    "the first - order model is in between the other models with 21.2% of all flow .",
    "overall , the higher - order markov models show a wide range of scores from the lowest to the highest values .          a method that is good in theory is of little use if the results are not robust in practice . for journal rankings ,",
    "the most crucial factor is how robust the results are to the particular selection of journals included in the analysis . for journals indexed by thomson reuters web of science , the citation data are more or less complete for the indexed journals .",
    "however , only a fraction of journals are indexed and the rankings inevitably depend on the selection . therefore , we examined the robustness of the different models by performing analysis on random sub - samples of the set of all journals .",
    "we generated sub - samples that contained 90% , 80% , ",
    ", 10% of all journals by randomly including the journals . since highly ranked journals are more likely to be included in practice , we complemented this uniform sampling with a proportional sampling in which we included journals proportional their citation counts . for each sub - sample size",
    ", we generated 10 samples and measured the ranking similarity between all pairs of rankings for each model .",
    "we used the normalized mutual information for rankings to measure the similarity @xcite .",
    "this measure quantifies between 0 and 1 how much information one ranking provides about the other for journals common to both rankings .",
    "results close to 1 mean that few journal pairs swap ranking order between rankings and indicate that the results are robust to the selection of journals .",
    "figure  [ fig : samplerobustness ] shows that the ranking robustness to journal selection tends to increase with markov order .",
    "all models become less robust with decreasing sample sizes , but the median ranking similarities among all journals are generally higher for the first- and second - order markov models ( fig .  [",
    "fig : samplerobustness]a ) , and among top 100 journals highest for the second - order markov model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : samplerobustness]b ) .",
    "for example , for the ranking similarity among top 100 ranked journals with 90% proportionally sampled journals reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : samplerobustness]b , the second - order model is more robust than the zero- and first - order models in 89% and 84% of the comparisons , respectively .",
    "at least three factors influence the robustness : the weight of citations , how local the model is , and the range of ranking scores . in the zero - order model ,",
    "all citations carry equal weight and perturbations of low - ranked journals will have as high impact as perturbations of high - impact journals . in the higher - order models ,",
    "the weight of citations from low - ranked journals is reduced and has less impact on the ranking .",
    "the zero - order and also the second - order model are more local in the sense that perturbations do not propagate across the network .",
    "for the zero - order model , it is simply because only directly cited journals are affected . for the second - order model , it is because the model can capture more constrained dynamics as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematicwalk ] and demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , the range of scores can influence the robustness in two ways .",
    "first , simply because any two journals tend to be farther apart in units of ranking score .",
    "second , because in the normalized mutual information between rankings we make pairwise comparisons with weights proportional to the ranking scores of the journals .",
    "since the top journals have more extreme ranking values in the higher - order models , effectively fewer journal pairs will dominate the similarity measure .",
    "all these effects together make the higher - order markov models more robust to the selection of journals included in the analysis .",
    "finally , to validate that the data are sufficient for analysis with higher - order markov models , we conducted a cross - validation test @xcite .",
    "if the data were not sufficient , the models would overfit the data and this could lead to false conclusions .",
    "for example , the ranking scores of the higher - order markov models could be different from the lower - order markov models simply because of noise in sparse data .",
    "we performed the cross - validation test by predicting movements of the random walker in the second - order markov model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : secondordernextstep ] ) with the zero- , first- , and second - order models .",
    "first , we divided all articles in 2007 into 10 random sets and generated 10 corresponding sets of trigrams , such that aggregating them all would give the complete set of trigrams .",
    "then , in each of 10 folds , we aggregated nine sets into a training set and used the last set for validation . for each fold and each order model @xmath121 , we measured the cross - entropy @xmath122 of the probability distributions @xmath123 of the validation set and @xmath124 of the training set for the zero- , first- and second - order models @xmath125 , @xmath126 that is , we measured the cost in bits of predicting the next journal in a random walk on the validation set with transition rates obtained from the training set .",
    "we found that navigation on the validation set costs 10.1(1 ) bits with the zero - order , 9.1(1 ) bits with the first - order , and 9.2(1 ) bits with the second - order markov model fitted on the training set .",
    "thus , the two higher - order models have a clear advantage over the zero - order model .",
    "while the two higher - order models perform similarly averaged over all journals , a journal - by - journal comparison highlights their differences .",

    "we have shown that the robustness of flow - based rankings to the selection of included journals tends to increase with increasing markov order .",

    "since the decision about which journals to include is difficult to make objectively and rarely made transparently , the robustness of a ranking scheme is important . whereas our analysis indicates that higher - order models perform better , the performance gain for the second - order markov model comes at the cost of requiring more citation data over a longer time period . while rankings can have many different objectives and be subject to various constraints that would favour other ranking schemes , if the sole objective of the ranking is to accurately capture likely pathways of researchers navigating between journals , model selection shows that using the more complex models pay off .",

    "<S> as the number of scientific journals has multiplied , journal rankings have become increasingly important for scientific decisions . from submissions and subscriptions to grants and hirings , researchers , policy makers , and funding agencies make important decisions with influence from journal rankings such as the isi journal impact factor . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the rankings are derived from the citation network between a selection of journals and unavoidably depend on this selection . </S>",
    "<S> however , little is known about how robust rankings are to the selection of included journals . </S>",
    "<S> here we compare the robustness of three journal rankings based on network flows induced on citation networks . </S>",
    "<S> they model pathways of researchers navigating scholarly literature , stepping between journals and remembering their previous steps to different degree : zero - step memory as impact factor , one - step memory as eigenfactor , and two - step memory , corresponding to zero- , first- , and second - order markov models of citation flow between journals . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that higher - order markov models perform better and are more robust to the selection of journals . </S>",
    "<S> whereas our analysis indicates that higher - order models perform better , the performance gain for the second - order markov model comes at the cost of requiring more citation data over a longer time period .    </S>",

    "<S> science builds on previous science in a recursive quest for new knowledge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> researchers put great effort into finding the best work by other researchers and into achieving maximum visibility of their own work . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they both search for good work and seek to publish in prominent journals . inevitably , where researchers publish becomes a proxy for how good their work is , which in turn influences decisions regarding hiring , promotion , and tenure , as well as university rankings and academic funding @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> researchers depend on the perceived importance of the journals they publish in . </S>",
    "<S> while actually reading the work published in a journal is the only way to qualitatively evaluate the scientific content , different metrics are nevertheless used to quantitatively assess the importance of scientific journals @xcite . in different ways , </S>",
    "<S> the metrics extract information from the network of citations between articles published in the journals .    in this paper , we analyze three flow - based journal rankings @xcite that at different order of approximations seek to capture the pathways of researchers navigating scholarly literature . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the metrics measure the journal visit frequency of random walk processes that correspond to zero- , first- , and second - order markov models . </S>",
    "<S> that is , given a citation network between journals and a random walker following the citations , movements in a zero - order model are independent of the currently visited journal , movements in a first - order model depend only on the currently visited journal , and movements in a second - order model depend both on the currently visited journal and the previously visited journal .    evaluating </S>",
    "<S> ranking methods inevitably becomes subjective , as their objectives often are different . </S>",
    "<S> which method is best , the most transparent @xcite , the most difficult to game @xcite , or the one with highest predictive power @xcite ? irrespective of the specific objective , perhaps the most important criterion is nevertheless the robustness of the method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because journal rankings depend on the selection of journals included in the analysis , we compare the robustness of rankings obtained with zero- , first- , and second - order markov models with random resampling techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> we first describe the commonly used metrics impact factor and eigenfactor , which correspond to specific implementations of zero- and first - order markov models , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then we put them in the same mathematical framework and show how a second - order markov model can be devised in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> we use data from thomson reuters web of science and compare the methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of ranking order , ranking score distributions , and robustness . </S>"
