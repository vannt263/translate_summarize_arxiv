    "in a theoretical analysis of impurity signatures , principally important is the fact that the equilibrium between the ( nearest neighbors ) lattice atoms , and the implanted impurity atom represents the structural balance between local geometry and chemical bonding , which depends strongly on the interatomic distances . in order to explore the dynamical nature of substituent effects on small",
    "length scales one can employ an approach based on a detailed atomistic view : it can be straightforwardly implemented within ab - initio numerical simulations , which are able to calculate the relative ionic displacements and the charge density redistribution accompanying the effect of the substitution .",
    "the results of calculations will then allow us both to capture the final binding geometry around the impurity site and to answer the fundamental question as to what extent the impurity atom is capable of adapting itself to the local environment and the existing chemical bonds .    in this paper",
    ", we apply such integrative approach to investigate the effects of substitutions for several @xmath2 transition - metal impurities such as divalent @xmath3 , @xmath4 and tetravalent @xmath5 in magnesium diboride @xmath0 .",
    "we consider @xmath0 containing substitutions of @xmath6 as a doped model system for which we perform a series of the relevant numerical simulations .",
    "there are two reasons that make this system attractive for detailed study .",
    "first , while different properties of magnesium diboride doped by a variety of impurity atoms have been extensively studied in the past decade , the investigation of impurities in this material is still a topical subject , raising a number of actual issues that are worthy of special attention ( for details see  @xcite , and the references cited therein ) .",
    "the other reason is that knowledge on how the arrangement of a single impurity ion influences on a local structural order may have useful predictive value in the rational design of magnesium diboride solid solutions .",
    "one of those issues , which is especially important to all aspects of local geometry and stability , is the influence of substitutions on a principal atomic configuration and the bonding properties of the cation environment .",
    "however , in many cases , information on the bonding situation around a substitutional impurity turns out to be limited , and there remain several questions about binding of metal elements incorporated into the place of the host @xmath7 cation . understanding the latter is very essential because the response of the system on doping is not clear _ a priori_. for example , it was experimentally established that the suppression of the superconducting properties proceeds much slower in the @xmath8- , @xmath9- and @xmath10-doped systems , as compared to compounds that contain other dopant ions of the same formal valences ( details can be found in  @xcite ) . in table 1 , using the data available from the literature , we have summarized some examples related to this observation .",
    "@rcccccccc @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 + @xmath20 @xmath21 & @xmath22@xmath23 & @xmath24@xmath25 & @xmath26@xmath27 & @xmath24@xmath28 & @xmath29@xmath30 & @xmath31@xmath32 & @xmath33@xmath32 & @xmath34@xmath35 + & @xmath26@xmath36 & @xmath37@xmath38 & @xmath39@xmath40 & @xmath41@xmath28 & @xmath42@xmath32 & @xmath43@xmath32 & @xmath44@xmath32 & @xmath45@xmath35 + & @xmath46@xmath36 & & @xmath47@xmath40 & @xmath48@xmath28 & @xmath49@xmath32 & & & @xmath50@xmath35 +     + @xmath23@xcite ; @xmath36@xcite ; @xmath25@xcite ; @xmath38@xcite ; @xmath27@xcite ; @xmath40@xcite ; @xmath28@xcite ; @xmath30@xcite ; @xmath32@xcite ; @xmath35@xcite    from the rate of decrease of the superconducting temperature @xmath51 with chemical substitution of the original @xmath52 with metal elements in @xmath0 one can expect that not all the impurity properties are matched well with those of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the given example of table 1 shows that conceptually @xmath8- , @xmath9- and @xmath10-containing solutions stand among other doped systems as a particular example . this feature prompted us to examine in more detail the role of these substitutional ions and ion - specific effects in the context of impurity - induced changes in local structure , dynamics and chemical bonding .",
    "therefore , the aim of the present paper is by employing ab initio calculations to study variations of certain lattice and charge characteristics , such as lattice distortions , interatomic forces , charge densities and bonding features , caused by compositional variations in @xmath0 . by comparative analysis of features of the impurity atom with those related to the host one we pay attention in our work to what is happening within an ionic environment in the elementary cell when an intensity of interionic and electronic correlations is affected by the replacements of a magnesium cation .",
    "according to the literature data ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , a crystalline structure of the bulk @xmath0 consists of alternating honeycomb layers of @xmath1 interleaved with closed packed layers of @xmath6 .",
    "each @xmath6 atom is located at the center of a hexagon formed by boron ; by donating two valence electrons it becomes a strongly charged ion with a charge very close to @xmath53 .",
    "consensus on the nature of the superconductivity in @xmath0 is based on a generic multiband model which employs the intra- and interband pair - scattering mechanisms .",
    "the presence of the interband channel connecting the @xmath54 and the @xmath55 electronic bands  @xcite gives rise to a unique property of @xmath0 - two - gap superconductivity , which is characterized by two gaps of different sizes that are simultaneously closed at the same temperature @xmath51 of the superconducting transition .",
    "the first - principles modeling of the effects of @xmath56 ion substitutions in the @xmath57 compositions , where @xmath58 stands for a transition metal cation such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , was performed using the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite in conjunction with a plane - wave - basis code and the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite .",
    "exchange - correlation effects were described through the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) framework  @xcite . for geometry optimization ,",
    "one of the host atoms was replaced by one @xmath58 element in a @xmath59-atoms supercell ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "such arrangement shown in figure 1 corresponds to @xmath61 in terms of the formal stoichiometry of the doped system .",
    "the lattice distortion caused by the substitution has the following features : ( 1 ) it is totally symmetric on the cation site , and ( 2 ) it involves displacements of @xmath62 nearest - neighbor boron atoms from regular positions . for a central boron atom , these displacements",
    "lead in turn to local symmetry breaking .",
    "full relaxation of atomic positions was made with periodic boundary conditions and theoretical ( structurally relaxed ) bulk lattice parameters .",
    "the convergence criteria for total energy and residual forces calculations were set to be within @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath63 ev /  , respectively .",
    "a cut - off energy of @xmath65 ev and a monkhorst - pack @xmath66-point grid  @xcite of @xmath67 has been employed .",
    "this computational scheme was successfully tested by a comparison of the calculated values of the lattice constants , @xmath68  ; @xmath69  ; @xmath70 , with the experimental data  @xcite , @xmath71  ; @xmath72  ; @xmath73 ( the deviations are @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ) .",
    "changes in chemical bonding upon incorporation of a dopant atom into a @xmath52-site was studied in terms of charge - density distributions . in order to characterize variations of the partial charges at the magnesium position upon substitution and to assign a specific meaning of ionic charges in the analysis , values of the bader effective charges  @xcite have been evaluated .",
    "their calculations were carried out by using software  @xcite , which utilizes a grid - based bader analysis algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of local many - body polarization effects was analyzed in terms of the born effective charges , values of which have been obtained by using the special extended method adopted at vasp .",
    "in tables 2 to 5 , we present the main results which characterize the influence of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 substitutional impurities on displacements of the boron atoms , the electronic charge redistribution around a cation , and the local properties of chemical bonding in @xmath76 .",
    "these results and several consequences of magnesium replacement are discussed below .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized at the end of the paper .",

    "we pay attention to the data of table 2 as they reveal certain trends .",
    "first , no significant changes are seen  local lattice distortions , and",
    "the induced changes in transverse ionic strengths caused by cationic substitution appear to be notably small .",
    "particularly , this observation relates to cases with @xmath86 and @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that the relevant bond lengths are preserved , and the boron layer remains planar .",
    "further , it is also seen from table 2 that longitudinal ( in - plane ) stresses are more strongly affected by the impurities , though the induced changes remain relatively small .",
    "the overall comparison of the data of table 1 with the simulation results of table 2 reveals a certain correlation between the variation in the magnitude of the @xmath51 suppression rate ( @xmath96 ) and the doping induced changes in the boron sublattice .",
    "this can be emphasized by observing the following difference : while in the majority of the doped solutions , the presence of several percents of divalent impurity metal atoms provides already a considerable suppression of @xmath51 , there are substitutions such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or even tetravalent @xmath10 low concentrations of which slightly influence both the superconducting order and the specific positions of the boron atoms .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy seems to be related primarily to the strong @xmath97 @xmath98-@xmath98 linkage dominating in the boron layer  @xcite which , as we have shown above , tends to keep the existing structural stability upon a change in the host cation .",
    "considering @xmath52 as a reference cation , another interesting result is that one may say according to  @xcite that the incorporation of just @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 into the @xmath52-site has little effect on actual interband pairing channels .",
    "correspondingly , in these cases , the protection function of the covalent boron linkage can not be markedly influenced ( at low doping levels ) what may provide a much weaker dependence of the superconducting temperature @xmath51 on impurity content .      in order to get further insight into why the substitutional @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 cause only minor changes in a planar geometry of the covalent boron layer",
    ", we undertook an investigation of how local properties of chemical bonding are affected by the overall electronic structure and elemental characteristics of each of the considered impurity ions . for characterization of impurity - induced changes in chemical bonding via the differences of the electron states between the host and foreign cations , we performed an extensive comparative analysis of the relevant charge partitioning schemes . figure 2 shows charge density maps calculated for @xmath0 and all three doped cases ; the maps are projected onto the @xmath99 plane and contain the central @xmath6 or @xmath100 cations , and surrounding @xmath1 atoms",
    ". figure 3 is instructive in another way : for each cation considered , it shows the line charge density distributions along the @xmath52-@xmath98 and @xmath58-@xmath98 directions , respectively .",
    "computed values of the bader effective charges ( @xmath101 ) presented in table 3 reflect the topology features of the underlying electron - density distribution emerging as a direct consequence of the relevant arrangements .",

    "comparison of figures 2 , 3 and the data of table 3 for the reference case of the @xmath56 ion reproduces the well - established result  @xcite that @xmath52 is an ionically - bonded cation ( with an admix of some weak covalency ) in a stable divalent state .",
    "analysis of cases where @xmath8 or @xmath9 substitutes for @xmath52 revealed three significant differences .",
    "first , as depicted in table 3 , the bader effective charges are quite different from the formal chemical charge @xmath114 .",
    "two other differences are very clearly delineated on figures 2 and 3 ; common to both ions they are : a depletion of the electron charge along the metal - boron bonding direction , and a large degree of electron charge accumulation of fairly good spherical form around the nuclei .",
    "correspondingly , the physical picture of the outer electronic structure of @xmath8 and @xmath9 incorporated into magnesium diboride can be drawn as follows : ( i ) the @xmath115 states appear to be completely filled ( what provides increased electron density at the substituent , causes the observed spherical charge distribution around it , and induces the smaller effective charge transfer , in comparison with magnesium ) , ( ii ) zinc and copper cations acquire fractional quantities of the @xmath116 electron populations , about @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively , ( iii ) the partially filled @xmath116 states constitute the resulting outermost orbitals , and ( iv ) the @xmath119-electron covalency effects are extremely low because the filled @xmath115 levels of the substituent are shielded by its @xmath116 states . remarkably , smallness of the effective charges relative to the nominal chemical valence @xmath120 is an indication of the fact that the substitutional cations have retracted the certain amount of the delocalized electrons that participate in metallic bonds .",
    "the reason why just the electrons shared by the boron atoms are excepted is that the significant changes in an equilibrium planar geometry of the covalent boron layer are absent .",
    "furthermore , of note is another observation from table 3 that the local loss of charge exchange activity is directly connected with the drop in the electronegativity difference with respect to boron in the series of elements @xmath52 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    it may be concluded thus that both substitutions give rise to a negative tendency which manifests itself ( i ) in increasing the electron density around outer orbitals of the @xmath8 or @xmath9 cations , and ( ii ) in decreasing the positive charge at the cation center up to the values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "this leads to partial neutralization of the overall charge on the substituents , makes the initial charge transfer channels much weaker and therefore causes the significant reduction of the polar contribution into the cationic nature of the substitutional ion .",
    "as a result , the initial , predominantly ionic character of the local environment is degraded .",
    "the variances of the bader effective charges from the nominal @xmath114 may therefore be regarded as a degree of @xmath8 or @xmath9 `` underbonding '' that should have a certain effect on physical properties of @xmath0 doped by these elements .",
    "for example , since the interband channel is unaltered ( because of minor changes in a planar geometry of the covalent boron layer ) , the experimentally observed smallness of suppression of the superconducting temperature is perfectly understandable via influence of the above - mentioned retraction of `` previously expelled electrons '' on the density of electronic states at the fermi level .",
    "this result correlates well with the conclusion made in  @xcite for a series of @xmath123-@xmath124 codoped @xmath0 systems that the superconductivity is much more affected by the relevant lattice distortion induced by impurity ion substitution than by the band filling .",
    "the trend towards electron density accumulation and a weakening of charge transfer channels breaks down for the case of the substitutional @xmath91 in the structure of @xmath0 .",
    "although @xmath91 possesses almost the same electronegativity difference as @xmath6 , the calculated value of the bader effective charge , @xmath125 , is considerably different from the formal valence @xmath126 . from chemical point of view",
    ", this implies that the zirconium cation in the @xmath0 lattice tends towards a lower oxidation state configurations of low - valent @xmath127 in complex sheet and cluster structures  @xcite . ] .",
    "in contrast to zinc and copper ions , @xmath91 attempts to expand definite amounts of charge density from itself toward an interstitial area .",
    "analysis of figures 2 and 3 strongly suggests the moderate enhancement of the positive charge on the cation which takes place due to delocalization of its @xmath128 electrons caused by partial donation of @xmath129 additional electrons .",
    "such a delivery of a partial charge ( along the metal  non - metal charge - transfer configuration ) is well correlated with a chemical readiness of the zirconium cation to give up the valence @xmath130 electrons in order to move back to the predominant oxidation state of @xmath131 and to activate the covalent bonding with neighboring atoms .",
    "consequently , as compared with the parent compound @xmath0 , an ionization increase @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 on a substitutional cation site and the presence of appreciable covalency in the same region may give rise to a tendency towards dielectrization of the system .",
    "this observation is confirmed by first - principles studies of the bulk compound @xmath113  @xcite , which show the presence the strong hybridization between the @xmath91 @xmath128 and the @xmath1 @xmath135 states as well as drastic fall of the density of electronic states at the fermi level .",
    "thus , we can conclude that electronic charge distribution at the @xmath52 position in the bulk magnesium diboride is very sensitive to the cation replacement .",
    "firstly , the substitution for an impurity ion of the same nominal charge @xmath120 leads to a substantial charge redistribution around the cation .",
    "secondly , the change in the chemical bonding character depends on the type of metal ion and its electronegativity versus boron , so that among substitutional ions considered two different trends can be distinguished .",
    "all this underlines in the light of the bonding situation that ion substitution not only always affects the existing chemical bonds but also that the resulting charge rearrangement is exhibited quite differently for the cations considered in the present work . moreover , in the context of superconductivity , these features can seriously limit the targeting efficiency of a number of potential substituents or even make them unfavorable towards the enhancement of superconducting properties .      to complete the results obtained for impurity - induced changes in the cation charge states ,",
    "it should be interesting to study how these changes proceed under pressure .",
    "for this purpose , the @xmath10- and @xmath8-doped case were considered .",
    "we employed the same set of calculations as used throughout this work and fully relaxed a doped system .",
    "the resulting pictures of the charge density maps are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the comparison of the charge distributions with those shown in figure 2 reveals no significant changes between them . the most remarkable difference is a slight increase of the bader effective charge of the @xmath10 cation  from @xmath136 at zero pressure to @xmath137 under pressure of @xmath138 gpa ( what evidently indicates the above - mentioned oxidation tendency to the tetravalent state ) .",
    "this implies that the charge state of @xmath10 remains relatively stable with compression until at least @xmath138 gpa .",
    "the @xmath8 substitutional cation also demonstrates the similar tendency to maintain its charge state under pressure .",
    "for example , the calculated change in the bader effective charge under compression of @xmath139 gpa , @xmath140 , shows that due to contraction of the filled @xmath115 levels , valence electrons do not favor extra oxidation . as a result ,",
    "the overall charge configuration of @xmath8 in magnesium diboride is essentially unaffected by pressure .",
    "another possible microscopic reason of lattice distortions stems from the fact well - known in the theory of local phase transitions that distortion of local geometry around an impurity may be caused by sufficient strength of the purely dynamical part of the charge transfer ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "generally speaking , significance of dynamical charge transfer processes generated by vibronic mixing of the proper electronic states is one of most important characteristic features of polar crystals  @xcite . on the atomic level , this feature is associated with many - body polarization effects that contribute to ionic dipole polarization , and it reflects a mixed ionic(polar)-covalent character of the relevant chemical bonds  @xcite . since the latter can be interpreted in terms of the born dynamic effective charges with respect to some reference ( nominal ) ionic value ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the calculations of the principal values of the born dynamic effective charge tensor @xmath141 can be employed as a test of how electronic effects of the many - body nature translate the polar contribution into ionic chemical bonding .",
    "it is also of note that although the idea of calculation of the born dynamic effective charges for a conducting material may seem senseless at first glance , it can be , due to logic behind the ionic bonds and charge transfer , reasonably useful for a mixed bonded solid , indicating how specific pieces of a composite picture of chemical bonding may be distinguished .    in table 4 , we have presented the converged values of the born effective charge for the magnesium cation in @xmath0 ( due to metallic properties of @xmath0 , we focused on dynamic charges only for cations and not for boron atoms ) .",
    "it may be assumed that the numerical convergence to stable values of table 4 is guaranteed by the nearly ionic character of the @xmath52 sublattice which , in the spirit of layered superconductivity approach  @xcite , can be figuratively imagined as a stack of the intrinsic insulating layers .",
    "calculations have also predicted principal values of the electronic dielectric constant for the bulk magnesium diboride : @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "the theoretical value @xmath144 , evaluated as an average @xmath145 , is quite comparable with the experimental estimate of @xmath146  @xcite thus proving the consistency of the present analysis .",
    "@*7cccc @xmath147 & @xmath148 & @xmath149 & @xmath150 + @xmath151 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 & @xmath153 +    the tensorial nature of the born effective charge provides subtle information concerning differences in directions and strengths of dynamical processes related to the ionic sites and caused by the polarization effects .",
    "as seen by comparing the values of table 4 , there exists a certain anisotropy , as is indicated by the observation that in the directions perpendicular ( the @xmath154-plane ) and parallel to the @xmath77-axis the components of the dynamic charge differ markedly from the formal value of @xmath155 .",
    "this suggests that , although on the average @xmath52 remains quite well ionized in the full @xmath156-particle ensemble ( @xmath157 ) , ( i ) the attached effective potential , which gives rise to polarization force fields acting in a local environment around magnesium , appears non - spherical , and ( ii ) due to deviation from the nominal ionic charge some contribution of the pure dynamic covalent nature in the magnesium ",
    "boron bonding should be assumed .",
    "the latter is entirely consistent with previous studies of dynamical covalency effects in @xmath0  @xcite .    in order to analyze how the change in the host cation influences the attached effective potential",
    ", we carried out the relevant calculations of the born effective charges for the substitutional impurities we are considering here .",
    "in contrast to the previous case of magnesium , the computational method failed to give uniform results consistent with hexagonal symmetry . in the physical sense , the lack of numerical consistency is not discouraging , and should be considered as an additional confirmation of the drastic changes of a charge state which arise around the host cation position due to its replacement . in other words ,",
    "impact of the substitutions with such unavoidable outcomes as falling of ionic character of chemical bonding , and the expansion of a metallic environment beyond the range of the boron layers  @xcite make it impossible to get from the method of calculations the target values of dynamic charges for the foreign cations . to obtain some approximate estimates of the born effective charges ,",
    "we have constructed a smooth procedure based on averaging the obtained results over the supercell , so that all the cations employed in the calculations are taken into account .",
    "this can be done since overall charge balance is maintained .",
    "due to electroneutrality of the simulation supercell , one can then expect that summation eliminates off - diagonal contributions , suppresses discontinuities , random perturbations and other artificial symmetry effects and thus will return the weighted - average components of the born effective charge tensor in the original diagonal form .    in table 5",
    ", we have presented the numerical values of the dynamic charges for @xmath81 , @xmath86 and @xmath91 substitutional cations as averages over the supercell .",
    "@*7lcccc & @xmath158 & @xmath159 & @xmath160 & @xmath161 + @xmath81 & @xmath162 & @xmath162 & @xmath163 & @xmath164 + @xmath86 & @xmath165 & @xmath166 & @xmath167 & @xmath168 + @xmath91 & @xmath169 & @xmath170 & @xmath171 & @xmath172 +    it is seen that the remaining uncertainties on the averaged values of charges are really negligible , so that this type of approximation is quite reasonable . nevertheless , one additional aspect which should be discussed here is the sensitivity of the retrieval accuracy within such a calculation procedure .",
    "first of all , we note that all off - diagonal contributions are exactly eliminated . on the other hand ,",
    "the required identity of the diagonal terms ( @xmath173 ) is restored at different accuracy levels : for zinc and copper , we get a more accurate retrieval than for zirconium .",
    "we believe that this result is not surprising because some discrepancy in the case of zirconium suggests that due to the expansion of metallic bonds into the cationic environment , the effect of charge fluctuations is not completely eliminated after summation over the supercell .",
    "the results listed in table 5 allow us to characterize the specific features of chemical bonds in terms of the born effective charges as follows .",
    "( i ) a dynamic component in resulting chemical bonding becomes smaller upon cation substitution ( as compared with that of @xmath52 ) , and ( ii ) this partial loss in initial dynamic covalency is caused by the relevant charge redistribution around the cation position . at the same time , as seen from table 5 , a rate of an anisotropy in the dynamics of valence charge distribution remains relatively unchanged in the cases of zinc and zirconium .",
    "moreover , of all three components just the @xmath174 component of the born effective charge , which is particularly interesting for dynamical covalency effects in magnesium diboride , tends to be close to the @xmath77-axis value of the @xmath52 cation and therefore appears , in comparison with in - plane @xmath175 , @xmath176 components , to be more robust to alteration of charge densities .",
    "following the same consideration as in  @xcite , this leads us to an understanding regarding why lattice distortions induced by @xmath81 , @xmath86 or @xmath91 ions are so small : the explanation is that the ionic strength changes induced by variations of dynamical charge transfer along the @xmath77-axis are not large enough to drive the relative boron displacements .",
    "in order to understand the leading factors that govern adjustments of the lattice positions during accommodating the foreign cation in @xmath0 , we investigated the induced deformations ( lattice distortions ) in the local geometry of the boron sites .",
    "the first - principles calculations were performed for three different substitutional cations such as divalent @xmath4 and @xmath3 , and tetravalent @xmath5 .",
    "these species are of particular interest because they demonstrate the lowest - observed - droop of the superconducting temperature among most of the impurities of the same formal valences .",
    "inspection of the relaxed lattice structures together with the results of the performed calculations allowed the following conclusions to be drawn : ( i ) at a low doping level , the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 substitutions cause only negligible changes in the structural arrangement of the neighboring boron atoms .",
    "( ii ) such an insignificant impact on the local geometry of the boron layer is mostly attributed to two aspects .",
    "the first is the observation that the existing in - plane @xmath98-@xmath98 covalent bonding is strong enough to keep effectively the boron atoms non - shifted under substitution of magnesium with @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the second is that dynamical covalency processes along the cation - boron bonding tend to be tolerant of changes in the host cation and , consequently , can not create a channel of instability in the boron layer .",
    "both aspects are important in view of the fact that the structural balance between local geometry and chemical bonding are related to the electron structure of the impurity and to the bonding connections carried out by the impurity .",
    "( iii ) a role of small deformations of the local geometry of the boron layer induced by the impurity ions may be insufficient to influence alone on superconductivity of the host system .",
    "( iv ) generally , our results emphasize that @xmath0 is the perfect material having a unique combination of an ideal planar layer structure , the predominantly ionic character of the cationic sublattice , and the high degree of chemical bonding stability .    in order to investigate the characteristic measures of impurity activity , such as charge states and the impurity - induced changes in the chemical bonding",
    ", we performed the comparison analysis of the underlying charge - transfer processes .",
    "it has been discovered that the replacement of @xmath56 by divalent @xmath4 , @xmath3 or tetravalent @xmath5 influences substantially the character of the charge transfer , so that the distributions of the charge around the impurities and degree of ionicity differ drastically both from that around the host cation and also from each other .",
    "it has been shown that the different cationic nature of the substituents dictates two entirely opposite directions along which the induced changes in the local structure take place .",
    "first , the change in the host cation leads to density contraction  the substitutional @xmath8 or @xmath9 demonstrate the considerable increase of the overall charge density due to retaining its valence electrons and the small amount of charge transfer to the boron layers .",
    "particularly , a larger accumulation of a charge and the least charge transfer are observed for the copper ion .",
    "it was argued that this process retracts the certain amount of the delocalized electrons from metallic bonds what causes the observed decrease in the superconducting temperature values as the substitution level grows .",
    "second , the change in the host cation leads to charge delocalization  no charge accumulation is observed for @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath10 incorporation into the @xmath52 site of @xmath0 tends ( a ) to preserve the initial charge transfer channels , and ( b ) by partial donation of @xmath128 electrons to add some amounts of ionicity and covalency into the local cation - anion coupling .",
    "it was suggested that such increasing of covalency character does not favor superconducting properties of the host material .",
    "the stability of charge states related to the impurity cations was tested against pressure : the pressure dependence of the charge transfer degree was found to be very weak .",
    "the theoretically observed effective charges indicate that the substitutional ions do not possess their formal valence ( oxidation state ) , and are characterized by different levels of electron delocalization ; zirconium as an electron donor is indeed stronger than magnesium . as a consequence , by comparison with less positively charged zinc and copper ,",
    "the behavior of zirconium remains much more tolerant ( affine ) to the usual ionic distribution associated with the host magnesium cation .    summing up",
    ", one can say that the induced local lattice distortions and changes of the charge transfer degree may serve as structurally sensitive prognostic parameters for signaling how the superconductivity in @xmath0-solid solutions is affected by impurities , for clarifying the functional roles and efficiency of such various factors as a geometry of the boron layer , the electronegativity difference , ionic character of the local environment , relative affinities toward magnesium and boron , etc . , and on this basis for facilitating more precise theoretical predictions in synthesis and characterization .",
