    "the development of the far - off - resonant optical techniques for trapping ultracold atomic gases has opened new directions in the studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "atoms can be confined regardless of their hyperfine ( spin ) state , thus avoiding freezing the atom s spin degree of freedom , making it available for the study of interesting spin dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the major achievements in this direction was the experimental creation of _ spinor _ becs @xcite .",
    "the spinor condensate formed by atoms with spin @xmath1 is described by a @xmath2-component macroscopic ( mean - field ) wave function , which gives rise to various phenomena that are not present in single - component becs , including formation of spin domains @xcite , spin textures @xcite , and multi - component ( vectorial ) solitons of bright @xcite , dark @xcite , gap @xcite and bright - dark @xcite types .    generally , the dynamics of the spinor @xmath0 bec is spin - mixing @xcite .",

    "spin - polarized _ states of the system , which are stationary solutions of the corresponding system of gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations @xcite .",

    "( fm ) , such as in @xmath3rb , and _ polar _ ( alias _ _  anti - ferromagnetic _ _ , afm ) , such as @xmath4na , ones , where the spin - dependent interactions are , respectively , attractive and repulsive .",
    "accordingly , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , spin - polarized states are modulationally stable / unstable in the afm / fm condensates .",
    "in this work , we focus on afm spinor condensates , and study , in particular , spin - polarized states of the spinor bec of @xmath4na atoms . assuming that this spinor system is confined in a strongly anisotropic trap , we first present the respective system of three coupled quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) gp equations .",
    "then , employing the so - called single - mode approximation @xcite , we use analytical and numerical methods to find the spin - polarized states of the system and study their stability via the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations ( i.e. , the linearization of the gp equations ) .",
    "the simplest possible form of these states are the stable thomas - fermi ( tf )  configurations ( for each hyperfine component ) .",
    "we also present other spin - polarized states , including ones in which one component maintains a pulse - like shape , inducing a hole in the other components , and structures with holes in all the three components .",
    "all these states feature instability regions too , but with values of the normalized instability growth rate up to @xmath5 .",
    "development of the oscillatory instabilities is examined by means of direct simulations .",
    "it is found that the structures with a hole in one component get weakly deformed , while the states with holes in all the three components suffer stronger deformations .",
    "if the three components are initially spatially separated , being confined in different harmonic traps , but are put in a single trap afterwards , spin domain - wall ( dw ) patterns are formed .",
    "a family of the dw solutions exists and is fully stable if , for a fixed value of the trap s strength , the chemical potential ( or the number of atoms ) exceeds a certain critical value .",

    "the development of the instability was investigated by means of direct numerical simulations , which demonstrate that it manifests itself at very long times , and results in a weak deformation of the states with a single hole in some of the components , and a stronger one in the states with holes in all components .",
    "fully stable families of spin - polarized states develop from initial configurations which are initially separated ( by means of three different traps ) components .",
    "these states form domain - wall structures between the components , at values of the chemical potential above a critical value . at the critical value ( corresponding to a certain norm , for a fixed trap s strength )",

    "it would clearly be interesting to investigate the existence and stability of higher - dimensional counterparts of the 1d spin - polarized states found in this work .",
