    "in 1982 , w .- m . ni wrote the first rigorous paper , @xcite , on an equation introduced ten years earlier by hnon in @xcite as a model for mass distribution in spherically symmetric clusters of stars .",
    "this equation goes now under the name of _ hnon equation _ , and was originally coupled with dirichlet boundary conditions : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the existence of solutions to ( [ eq : henond ] ) for @xmath5 is a standard exercise in critical point theory that can be solved by various simple approaches .    on the other hand , ni s main result states that has ( at least ) one solution provided @xmath6 and thus enlarges considerably the range of solvability beyond the classical critical threshold @xmath7 .",
    "it is also simple to prove , by means of the pohozaev identity , that for @xmath8 , problem ( [ eq : henond ] ) has no solution .",
    "thus for the dirichlet problem ( [ eq : henond ] ) the picture is rather sharp : setting @xmath9 , problem ( [ eq : henond ] ) is solvable if and only if @xmath10 . in the following",
    "we will call @xmath11 the _ hnon critical exponent_.    the key observation in ni s work is the fact that the presence of the weight @xmath12 , which is radial and vanishes at @xmath13 , allows one to gain compactness properties when one restricts the analysis to radial functions . indeed , by means of the pointwise estimate ( @xcite )",
    "@xmath14 , one can easily prove that the embedding of @xmath15 into @xmath16 is compact precisely for @xmath17 , and this is what one needs to prove existence of a solution to ( [ eq : henond ] ) .",
    "quite recently , much attention has been devoted to _ symmetry  breaking _ issues , namely to the question of whether least ",
    "energy solutions of are radially symmetric functions ( for example for large @xmath18 ) . in their seminal papers @xcite , smets _",
    "proved that this is indeed false for @xmath18 sufficiently large . in the last few years various aspects of the hnon equation",
    "have been analyzed , and the resulting literature is nowadays rather rich ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these papers concern the dirichlet problem .",
    "the hnon equation just recently started to draw attention when coupled with _",
    "neumann _ boundary conditions . in this case",
    "the problem reads @xmath19 and has been studied in @xcite , where the authors proved some symmetry  breaking results by connecting the question of symmetry of the ground states to the symmetry properties of extremal functions in some trace inequalities . in the paper @xcite of course",
    "it is assumed that @xmath20 , to use a variational approach in @xmath21 .    from the point of view of the mere _ existence _ of solutions for the neumann problem ( [ eq : henon ] ) , the situation presents both analogies and discrepancies with respect to the dirichlet problem . indeed ,",
    "also in the neumann case it is very easy to check that the problem admits at least one solution if @xmath22 , and it has been proved in @xcite that ni s result extends to ( [ eq : henon ] ) : by using an @xmath23 version of inequality ( [ grow ] ) , it is simple to prove that ( [ eq : henon ] ) admits at least one ( radial ) solution for every @xmath10 .",
    "if one wishes to complete the picture of the solvability for as a function of @xmath24 , like in the dirichlet case , one has to face the fact that the pohozaev identity gives no relevant information in presence of neumann boundary conditions . to our knowledge , it is not known whether the critical hnon exponent serves as a threshold between existence and nonexistence in .",
    "the purpose of this note is to fill this gap , by looking for radial solutions of   without any limitation on @xmath24 .",
    "of course without bounds on @xmath24 we can not make use of variational arguments , and we take instead an ode viewpoint . our main result is the following .",
    "[ th : main ] for every @xmath4 and @xmath3 , problem admits a strictly increasing radial solution .",
    "the preceding result shows that the uselessness of the pohozaev argument for nonexistence of solutions is not a technical obstruction , but reflects a completely different situation with respect to the dirichlet problem .",
    "though our arguments are rather simple , we point out that it is rather difficult to find in the literature existence results for elliptic equations without any growth condition ; some exceptions , for singularly perturbed elliptic problems can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "our main result can be easily extended to the more general problem @xmath25 under suitable assumptions on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but always with no growth restrictions on @xmath27 .",
    "the last section of the paper contains some numerical experiments that suggest a rather surprising fact : there are choices of @xmath28 , @xmath18 and @xmath24 for which many ( and possibly infinitely many ) radial solutions of seem to exist .",
    "we clearly state that this is only a numerical hint towards further research , since no rigorous proof has been written so far . by the way",
    ", we believe that for any choice of the parameters , problem has exactly one radial , increasing solution , but we have to state this only as a    * conjecture . * _ for every @xmath29 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the only solution of which is positive , radial and increasing is that of theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "_    the matter of uniqueness for radially symmetric solutions of semilinear elliptic equations on balls or annuli is a classical and often overwhelmingly difficult issue .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for a short summary of known results .",
    "we have been unable to find uniqueness results in the literature , concerning nonautonomous equations like with a monotonically increasing dependence on @xmath30 .",
    "a radial solution for must solve the ode problem @xmath31 we observe that @xmath32 corresponds to the neumann boundary condition , while we require @xmath33 to obtain classical solutions .",
    "since we do not impose any upper bound on @xmath24 , variational techniques do not seem to be useful to prove any existence result .",
    "for this reason we use a shooting method , which consists in finding @xmath34 such that the solution @xmath35 of the initial value problem @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 .",
    "equation @xmath38 can be written in the form @xmath39 and it is quite natural to introduce the auxiliary function @xmath40 . by the definition of @xmath41 and , we deduce that @xmath42 and that @xmath41 increases strictly if and only if @xmath43 where @xmath44 the curve @xmath45 will play a crucial rle in our discussion ; its peculiarity is that it is asymptotic to the coordinate axes , i.e. @xmath46 the next lemma is well known , see for example @xcite .",
    "[ lem:1 ] for every @xmath47 , problem is uniquely solvable on @xmath48 .",

    "we begin now a qualitative study of solutions to , with the aim of proving the existence of ( at least ) an initial datum @xmath50 such that the corresponding @xmath51 matches the neumann boundary condition at @xmath52 .",
    "take any  @xmath47 , and consider the solution @xmath35 of .",
    "the corresponding auxiliary function @xmath53 is strictly positive from @xmath54 until @xmath35 intersects the curve @xmath45 , see  .",
    "after the first crossing , the derivative of @xmath55 becomes negative .",
    "therefore there exists a zero of @xmath56 , and the first intersection point @xmath57 between the graph of @xmath35 and that of @xmath45 is well defined . by definition , @xmath58 ( at least ) on the interval @xmath59 .",

    "[ lem:2 ] for every @xmath62 we have @xmath63 .",

    "we are now ready to state our main result .    [ main ] for every @xmath4 and @xmath3 ,",
    "problem admits a strictly increasing radial solution .",
    "we have seen that the first critical point @xmath60 of @xmath35 is larger than 1 for small values of @xmath49 , and smaller than 1 for large values of @xmath49 .",
    "consider the map @xmath117 defined by @xmath118 .",
    "we have that @xmath119 , and lemma [ lem:3 ] implies that @xmath120 the implicit function theorem shows that @xmath121 is a continuous and even differentiable function .",
    "therefore , there exists @xmath122 such that @xmath123 .",
    "this means that @xmath124 is a radial solution of the neumann problem .    when @xmath24 satisfies the condition @xmath125 the maximum principle shows that every radial solution for the problem can change its monotonicity at most once , since it can intersect the curve @xmath45 at most twice .",

    "therefore @xmath130 is a supersolution that vanishes when @xmath129 intersects @xmath45 . from the maximum principle we deduce",
    "that @xmath131 can vanish at most twice .",
    "theorem [ main ] can be adapted to problem by imposing some suitable assumptions of the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "first of all , both functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined ( and continuous ) on @xmath48 , since we are looking for positive radial solutions ; furthermore we require :    ( h1 ) : :    @xmath26 is increasing , @xmath132    and    @xmath133 $ ] ; ( h2 ) : :    the function @xmath134 is strictly increasing ; ( h3 ) : :    @xmath135 ( @xmath136 if @xmath137 ) ; ( h4 ) : :    @xmath138 ( @xmath139 if    @xmath140 ) .    under conditions * ( h1)**(h4 ) * the equation @xmath141 defines implicitly a continuous curve @xmath142 which plays the same rle as the curve @xmath45 in the previous section . indeed if we call @xmath143 , then @xmath144 , which decreases since @xmath145 decreases and @xmath26 increases .",

    "( h3 ) * we get @xmath147 similarly , from * ( h4 ) * , @xmath148 we can now proceed exactly as in section [ sec : henon ] defining the auxiliary function @xmath41 and the points @xmath149 , @xmath60 .",
    "lemmas [ lem:2 ] , [ lem:3 ] , [ lem:4 ] and [ lem:5 ] can be proved also in this setting with minor changes .",
    "we then obtain the required generalization :    [ main2 ] let @xmath26 , @xmath150 be continuous functions . if assumptions * ( h1)**(h4 ) * are satisfied then problem admits a strictly increasing radial solution .",
    "[ esempi ] our assumptions are clearly satisfied by nonlinearities with arbitrarily fast growth at infinity , like @xmath151 , or @xmath152 for @xmath34 and @xmath153 . this latter case is particularly interesting , because it corresponds to trudinger ",
    "moser type problems without any restriction on @xmath154 and @xmath49 .",
    "though in this paper we work in dimension @xmath2 , it is immediate to check that our results hold also for @xmath155 , which is the case of the trudinger ",
    "moser problem .",
    "of course , * ( h3 ) * requires  @xmath137 , i.e. @xmath156 .",
    "similarly , a nonlinearity that is superlinear at zero forces @xmath157 to be infinite . also , we notice that homogeneity of @xmath26 plays no role , as long as @xmath158 satisfies the above assumptions ; for example @xmath159 , with @xmath18 , @xmath160 , is an admissible function .    it is proved in @xcite that in dimension @xmath2 , for any @xmath4 and for large values of @xmath161 , the problem @xmath162 does not have any positive radial solution whose derivative changes sign .",
    "we could not find any similar statement for a nonlinearity like @xmath163 .",
    "this section is devoted to the description of some numerical experiments .",
    "such results are purely numerical and non rigorous ; the purpose of the authors is , on one hand , to give some examples of the existence result proved in section [ sec : henon ] .",
    "on the other hand we want to point out some features of interest in the behavior of the solutions for the shooting problem when @xmath49 diverges to @xmath164 .",
    "these numerical experiments seem to indicate that the structure of the set of radial solutions of problem ( [ eq : henon ] ) is still far to be understood , and deserves further study .      the monotone solution for the hnon equation corresponds to a choice of the parameter @xmath49 such that the first maximum point @xmath60 of the solution of the shooting equation coincides with @xmath165 .    in the table on the right",
