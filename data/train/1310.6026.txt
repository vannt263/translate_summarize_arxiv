    "modern cosmology faces some major challenges , one of which is the phase of accelerated expansion experienced by the late time universe  @xcite , commonly referred to as cosmic acceleration . a universe described by general relativity and filled with matter ,",
    "is naturally expected to decelerate after the initial phase of rapid expansion following the big bang .",
    "the observed acceleration on large scales requires either an additional component , such as a static or dynamical dark energy , or a modification of the laws of gravity on the largest scales , commonly referred to as modified gravity .",
    "given the plethora of models that address the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration  @xcite , and given the wealth of high precision large scale data that will come readily available via upcoming and future experiments like dark energy survey  @xcite , euclid  @xcite and large synoptic survey telescope  @xcite , it is crucial and timely to identify the optimal parametrization that will allow model independent tests of gravity . in the recent years , there has been a wide effort in the community in this direction , with several alternatives being put forward and analyzed  @xcite-  @xcite .    in the quest for the optimal framework to perform cosmological tests of gravity , some authors have recently proposed an ` effective ' approach to unify dark energy and modified gravity modeling  @xcite-@xcite , inspired by effective field theories of inflation  @xcite and large scale structure  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to it as the _ effective field theory of dark energy _ ( hereafter eft ) .",
    "the aim of this approach , in particular the one in  @xcite , is that of creating a model independent framework that encompasses all single - field dark energy and modified gravity models , describing the evolution of the background cosmology and of perturbations with a finite number of functions of time introduced at the level of the action .",
    "the action is written in unitary gauge , in terms of an expansion in the operators that are compatible with the residual symmetries of unbroken spatial diffeomorphisms , organized in powers of the number of perturbations .",
    "there is a finite number of such operators for each order of perturbation ; in particular , only three functions affect the background dynamics . in principle",
    "it is possible to link each operator with the corresponding observable effects it produces on the cosmology  @xcite , although in practice such an identification is not always feasible",
    ".    this formalism has been conjectured as a unified description of dark energy and modified gravity to apply to tests involving data on linear cosmological perturbations , therefore it is generally assumed that a background evolution will be specified _ a priori _ ; in other words , the background functions will be chosen to closely mimic the evolution of the standard cosmological model ( @xmath1cdm ) , and one focuses on effects at the level of perturbations .",
    "however , fixing the expansion history does not determine all the eft functions , and there remain one completely free function of time out of the original three .",
    "given this high degree of freedom , and given that the remaining function affects also the evolution of perturbations , it is important to explore what general viability / compatibility rules can be placed on the background eft functions by requiring that the corresponding model gives a viable expansion history , rather than fixing the latter a priori . besides allowing us to exploit the valuable information from geometrical probes , these conditions will guide us in choosing appropriate ans@xmath0tze for these functions when moving to the main goal of the the eft approach , that is studying the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations in a model independent way .    in this paper",
    "we perform a dynamical analysis of the background cosmology , treating the three eft functions as unknown functions of time . despite the underdetermined nature of the system",
    ", we identify a set of variables that allows us to write it as an infinite - dimensional system with an important recursive structure .",
    "we then analyze several autonomous subsystems of increasingly higher dimension that , as we will illustrate , correspond to higher differential order for combinations of the eft functions ; in other words , we explore more and more general models of dark energy / modified gravity identifying at each order conditions of cosmological viability . furthermore , we exploit the recursive nature of the system to draw quite general conclusions on its cosmological dynamics , building on our findings at the lower orders .",
    "while we apply our method to some specific cases in order to elucidate it , the machinery we set up is general and can be used to perform dynamical analysis of models of dark energy / modified gravity within the broad and model independent eft framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly review the eft formalism , focusing on the terms and equations that are of interest for the background cosmology . in sec .  [ sec3 ] we set up the dynamical system , describe our strategy to make it autonomous and then proceed with the dynamical analysis at different , increasing , orders in sec .",

    "finally we discuss our results and conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we follow the work of  @xcite and consider the effective field theory of dark energy in jordan frame , described by the following action in unitary gauge : @xmath3 + s^{(2)}_{\\rm de } +   s_{m } [ g_{\\mu \\nu}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the bare planck mass , @xmath5 the ricci scalar , @xmath6 the perturbation to the upper time - time component of the metric and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are free functions of the time coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "our notation follows more closely that of  @xcite .",
    "the terms in the square brackets are the only ones that affect the dynamics of the background , and therefore the only ones of interest for our analysis . as such ,",
    "we have not written explicitly all the quadratic and higher order operators that describe the dynamics of perturbations , rather collecting them into @xmath11 . finally , @xmath12 is the action for all matter fields , that in the jordan frame are minimally coupled to the metric . for a detailed explanation of how action  ( [ eq : theaction ] )",
    "is constructed we refer the reader to  @xcite . here",
    ", let us stress that this action encompasses all single - field dark energy and modified gravity models , including the @xmath13 effective regime of higher dimensional theories",
    ". given one of these models , it is possible to translate it into the eft formalism by finding the appropriate matching for the eft functions as elucidated in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the important difference of  ( [ eq : theaction ] ) w.r.t .",
    "eft of inflation  @xcite is in the conformal factor @xmath14 , which can not be reabsorbed by a redefinition of the metric tensor because of the presence of matter .    varying the background action with respect to the metric and assuming a spatially flat flrw metric one obtains the following equations : @xmath15 where the dot indicates derivation with respect to time and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the background energy density and pressure of the @xmath18 matter component , for which we assume a perfect fluid form .",

    "the covariant , background - independent approach that we adopt  @xcite , aims at offering a general framework to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in a model independent way . in the latter context",
    ", it is common to fix the background history to the one of @xmath1cdm , or something close to that , and to focus on the dynamics of perturbations .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the cosmological concordance model is in very good agreement with current observables constraining the expansion history and that most alternative models are highly degenerate with it at the level of background dynamics , while predicting modifications at the level of perturbations . in the eft framework",
    "this practice would translate into assuming that the background is given _ a priori _",
    ", i.e. typically it is chosen to be close to the @xmath1cdm one , and one focuses on the coefficients of the higher order operators contained in @xmath11 .",
    "if we were to fix the expansion history , we could use eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann1 ] ) and  ( [ friedmann2 ] ) to eliminate two of the three eft functions , typically @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this however would still leave us with one completely undetermined function of time , @xmath7 for which we should make some arbitrary choice . in our analysis",
    ", we do not fix the expansion history , but rather we keep all the three functions free and , via a dynamical analysis of the background , we identify viable forms , as well as compatibility conditions for their time dependence in order for the model to produce an expansion history that is viable .",
    "the aim of our analysis is , given the high degree of freedom , to identify general rules of cosmological viability and compatibility for @xmath22 , that can guide us in later fixing them to some form or ans@xmath0tze when performing forecasts for large scale structure data .",
    "in this section we will set up the necessary ingredients to perform a dynamical analysis of the effective field theory of dark energy .",
    "we need to rewrite the equations for the background into an autonomous system of first odes , for which we can then study the stability around equilibrium points . to this purpose , we introduce the following dimensionless variables : [ variables ] x= , y= , u=,_0 = - ,  , _ n=-, ",
    ",_0 = - ,  , _ m = - ,  where the indices @xmath23 are unbounded from above .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann1])-([de_cons ] ) , we can write the following set of first order odes :    [ syst ] @xmath24    where @xmath25 this is a nonlinear , non - autonomous system that , however , displays a hierarchical structure in the equations for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 . we will shortly describe our strategy to approach it .",
    "( [ friedmann1 ] ) can be read as a constraint equation @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "when describing the cosmology of the different points , we will consider also the following parameters : @xmath30 respectively the de and radiation fractional energy density and the effective equation of state .",
    "note that what we define the fractional density parameters , are the standard ones rescaled by the function @xmath7 , as it is common to do in presence of a conformal coupling  @xcite .    in order to solve system  ( [ syst ] ) we first need to make it autonomous .",
    "the simplest option corresponds to setting @xmath31 to constant and evolve only the three core equations  ( [ systx])-([systu ] ) ; we refer to this case as the zero - th order one and analyze it sampling the space @xmath32 to find viable cosmologies . as we discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ seczero ] , this case corresponds to assuming that @xmath14 and @xmath33 are power laws in the scale factor . to go beyond this zero - th order analysis",
    ", we can start exploring the hierarchy of equations  ( [ systalpha ] ) and  ( [ systlambda ] ) , by setting @xmath34 and @xmath35 constant for given @xmath36 . we are then left with a @xmath37-dimensional system formed by the three core equations for @xmath38 , plus @xmath2 equations for @xmath39 and @xmath40 equations for @xmath41 .",
    "we perform the dynamical analysis of this system sampling the space @xmath42 and determining the regions for which one can obtain viable expansion histories . what is the corresponding form of the eft functions that we explore at this order ?",
    "let us develop the following argument in terms of @xmath14 ; it is then trivial to reproduce it for @xmath33 . from the definition of the @xmath26",
    ", we see that fixing @xmath43 gives [ nth_der ] ^(n)(t)=^(n)(t_0)a^-_n , where @xmath44 is the present time .",
    "now that we have an expression for the @xmath45 derivative of @xmath14 , we can use it to write [ taylor_exp ] ( t)=_i=0^n-1(t - t_0)^i + ^(n)(t_0)_t_0^ta^-_n()d , that shows that the constant @xmath34 ( @xmath46 ) parametrizes the remainder in a taylor expansion of order @xmath47 around the present time for the function @xmath7 .",
    "notice that in order for the above argument to hold one does not necessarily need @xmath44 to be the present time ( with @xmath48 ) ; the latter can be the desired choice in view of constraining the form of the eft functions at recent times  @xcite , where they are expected to have a non - trivial dynamics and where they are more likely to be probed .",
    "however , one can in principle choose any other @xmath44 that is suited to one s purpose , as long as @xmath49 is rescaled by @xmath50 in  ( [ nth_der ] ) and  ( [ taylor_exp ] ) . in the following sections",
    ", we separately analyze the stability of the system  ( [ syst ] ) at different orders .",
    "in particular , after analyzing the zero - th order case in sec .",
    "[ seczero ] , we maintain @xmath51 constant and focus on the @xmath52 channel of the system , solving @xmath53 equations for the variables @xmath54 .",
    "in other words , we focus on the class of models for which @xmath33 is a power law in the scale factor , while the conformal factor @xmath14 can be increasingly general as we go up with the order . alternatively one could fix @xmath14 to a constant and open the @xmath55 channel , which would correspond to exploring all minimally coupled models of de . finally , one could work with both channels and , for instance , explore , within this parametrized framework the full class of horndeski theories  @xcite .",
    "while we leave the former , as well as the most general case , for future work , we want to stress that the machinery set up in this paper is quite general and easily applicable to the other cases mentioned above .",
    "finally , let us point out that the structure of the system is such that the planes @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are all invariant manifolds , which implies that trajectories starting on one of these planes remain on it .",
    "this ensures that viable trajectories identified at a given order , will exist at all higher orders .",
    "we exploit this feature at the end of this section , when we reconstruct the dynamics at a generic order @xmath60 .",
    "the dynamics of system  ( [ syst ] ) can be studied analyzing the evolution around fixed / critical points , i.e. points @xmath17 satisfying the equilibrium condition @xmath61 . in the following we",
    "briefly summarize the general procedure ; for an exhaustive description of the technique , and for some applications to cosmological models we refer the reader to  @xcite-@xcite . after determining its fixed points , one proceeds to calculate the eigenvalues @xmath62 of the jacobian matrix @xmath63 of the system in order to linearize it around each critical point .",
    "this determines the stability nature of the point , in other words it controls how the system behaves when approaching the point .",
    "we are interested in hyperbolic critical points , since around these the linearized dynamical system is a good approximation of the full nonlinear system . by definition a critical point is said to be hyperbolic if all eigenvalues of @xmath63 have @xmath64 .",
    "hyperbolic critical points are robust , in the sense that small perturbations do not change qualitatively the phase portrait near the equilibrium . for an n - dimensional system one",
    "has n eigenvalues for each point and the stability depends on the nature of these eigenvalues , according to the following classification :    * all @xmath62 are real and have the same sign : * * negative eigenvalues @xmath65 stable node/ attractor ; * * positive eigenvalues @xmath65 unstable node ; * all @xmath62 are real and at least one positive and one negative @xmath65 saddle points ; * at least one eigenvalue is real and there are pairs of complex eigenvalues : * * all eigenvalues have negative real parts @xmath65 stable focus - node ; * * all eigenvalues have positive real parts @xmath65 unstable focus - node ; * * at least one positive real part and one negative @xmath65 saddle focus .",
    "a working cosmological model needs to first undergo a radiation dominated era , followed by a matter era , and then enter a phase of accelerated expansion ( de ) as indicated by observations  @xcite . in terms of critical points",
    "we need two saddle points for the radiation and the matter dominated eras , followed by a late time accelerated attractor , i.e. a stable node with @xmath66 .",
    "in addition we impose the constraints that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , given that matter and radiation energy densities should be positively defined , and @xmath69 to guarantee a stable gravity  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we allow the effective dark energy density to be negative since this quantity may not correspond to the energy density of an actual fluid , and may indeed be negative in some models of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "finally , in reconstructing viable trajectories , we require that the matter era is long enough to allow for structure formation .",
    "the simplest option to make the system  ( [ syst ] ) autonomous is setting @xmath71 and @xmath51 to constant and evolve only the core equations  ( [ systx])-([systu ] ) .",
    "the corresponding behavior of the eft functions is @xmath72 where the constants will depend on the initial conditions and their value does not affect the stability analysis .    unless @xmath73 , the system  ( [ systx])-([systu ] ) is not closed due to the dependence on @xmath74 through @xmath75 .",
    "we can use  ( [ systalpha ] ) for @xmath76 to get = ( 2_0 - _ 0 ^ 2 - 3 + 3y - 3x -u ) .",
    "the resulting critical points of the system and the analysis of their stability are shown in table  [ zeroordercp ] .",
    "we find that the same results are still valid if @xmath73 . in what follows we present their eigenvalues and discuss the cosmological viability .",

    "we will focus on its radiation dominated version , since it is the only point that can supply a radiation era for the zero - th order trajectories .",
    "it can be be easily seen that it corresponds to a saddle with @xmath92 if @xmath93 .    combining all the information above ,",
    "we conclude that viable cosmological models for the zero - th order case , can be recovered setting @xmath73 and @xmath94 , and they are characterized by the transitions @xmath95 ( radiation@xmath65 matter @xmath65 de attractor ) .",
    "one can actually further constrain the space @xmath32 . indeed , a peculiar feature of the zero - th order system is the disposition of the critical points . a careful analysis of the eigenvectors  ( [ eq : zeroorderp1])-([eq : zeroorderp4 ] )",
    ", shows that for any pair of critical points the heteroclinic orbits , i.e. the lines connecting the two points , are strainght lines .",
    "this is valid for any choice of @xmath32 and it allows us to put a stricter bound on @xmath51 by requiring a long enough matter era for the trajectories of interest .",

    "since after we set @xmath73 the coordinates of @xmath77 and @xmath89 are fixed ( i.e. independent on @xmath51 ) , we can use the constraint on the position of @xmath86 to put a stringent bound on @xmath51 ; indeed if we change the latter , and hence move @xmath86 , the duration of the matter era will change significantly . in other words , we need @xmath86 to be always close to its @xmath1cdm position , and this forces @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath73 and @xmath98 , _ and they are characterized by the transitions _ @xmath95 .",

    "we saw glimpses of this pattern already in the second order system in  [ secsecond ] , but it is not until we have @xmath60 that it displays fully .",
    "we will now exploit this feature to reconstruct the dynamical properties of the system at any given order @xmath60 , building on the findings of the lower order analyses .",
