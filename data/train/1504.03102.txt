    "since the discovery of a bow shock in the periphery of the bullet cluster 1e 0657 - 558 @xcite , it has been well established that shock waves exist in and around galaxy clusters .",
    "using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations for the large - scale structure ( lss ) formation of the universe , the origin and nature of shock waves in the intracluster medium ( icm ) as well as in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrated that abundant shocks are produced by supersonic flow motions during the process of hierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures , and that they could be classified into two categories , according to their locations relative to the host structures . _",
    "external shocks _ are formed at the outermost surfaces surrounding clusters , filaments , and sheets of galaxies by the accretion of cool ( @xmath1 k ) , tenuous gas in voids onto those nonlinear structures . since the accretion velocity around clusters can be as high as @xmath2 a few @xmath3 and the sound speed of accreting gas",
    "is @xmath4 , external shocks are strong with mach number as large as @xmath5 . on the other hand , _ internal shocks _ are produced inside the nonlinear structures , where the gas has been already heated to high temperature by previous episodes of shock passage , so their mach number is typically low with @xmath6 . while most of internal shocks have @xmath7 , those with @xmath8 play the most important role in dissipating the shock kinetic energy into heat in the icm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "internal shocks could be further classified by their origins into a number of types , which in fact may not be mutually exclusive .",
    "_ turbulent shocks _ are induced by turbulent flow motions in the icm and they are expected to have very small mach numbers , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "turbulent motions in the icm could be generated by several different processes : major or minor mergers , agn jets , galactic winds , galaxy wakes , and etc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "bow shocks found in the outskirts of merging clusters are commonly referred as _ merger shocks _ @xcite . in most cases merger shocks are weak with @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ infall shocks _ form by infall of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ; @xmath9 k ) into the hot icm along adjacent filaments @xcite .",
    "they could have relatively high mach numbers , reaching up to @xmath10 , and thus the ensuing cosmic - ray ( cr ) acceleration can be more efficient than in other types of shocks .    including the shock in the bullet cluster , a number of shocks have been found in x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these observations ,",
    "shocks are detected as sharp discontinuities in the temperature and surface brightness distributions , and their physical properties including the sonic mach number , @xmath11 , are estimated from the ` deprojected ' temperature and density jumps @xcite .",
    "most of the shocks detected in x - ray observations are weak with @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , shocks in the icm have been detected by radio observations , especially as the so - called radio relics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for reviews ) .",
    "radio relics are usually found in the cluster outskirts around the virial radius , @xmath13 .",
    "the radio emission is understood as synchrotron radiation from cr electrons with the lorentz factor of @xmath14 that are believed to be accelerated at the shocks associated with them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "high energy nonthermal particles can be produced via diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) at astrophysical shocks , such as interplanetary and supernova remnant shocks as well as cluster shocks in collisionless tenuous plasma @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that turbulence flow motions in the icm can produce magnetic fields of up to @xmath15 level ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    since the radio - emitting electrons with the lorentz factor of @xmath14 would not advect nor diffuse in the icm more than @xmath16 kpc away from the shock surface before they lose the energy due to radiative cooling via synchrotron emission and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is commonly thought that their acceleration sites are likely to be close to where the synchrotron emission is seen .",
    "so the physical properties of shocks in radio relics are inferred from observed quantities such as the injection spectral index at the shock edge , @xmath17 , and the spatial profile of surface brightness @xcite . note that the spectral index for the synchrotron spectrum _ integrated _ over the downstream behind a steady planar shock is expected to be @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most cases ,",
    "the mach number of shocks in radio relics was found to be in the range of @xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pre - acceleration of thermal electrons to suprathermal energies and subsequent injection into the fermi first - order process at shock have been one of the outstanding problems in the dsa theory .",
    "it is thought that the particle injection and dsa acceleration might be very inefficient at weak shocks ( @xmath20 ) because of small density compression across shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "especially , in the so - called `` thermal leakage '' injection model , proton injection is expected to be strongly suppressed at weak shocks ; the relative difference between postshock , proton thermal and flow speeds is greater and so it is less likely for postshock protons to recross the shock front at weaker shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although postshock electrons move faster than protons , they are tied to magnetic field fluctuations more tightly because of smaller rigidities ( i.e. @xmath21 ) .",
    "so it was speculated that the dsa of electrons at weak shocks would not be efficient either , for instance , not enough to explain the observed radio flux of spectacular giant radio relics such as the sausage relic .",
    "a pre - exiting population of electrons with the lorentz factor of @xmath22 was suggested as a possible solution to the low electron injection problem at weak cluster shocks @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite has suggested that a @xmath23-like distribution of suprathermal electrons may exist in high beta ( @xmath24 ) icm plasmas just like in solar winds , and facilitate the electron injection at weak shocks .",
    "recently , using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of weak shocks in high beta plasmas , @xcite and @xcite have shown that some of the incoming electrons gain energy via shock drift acceleration ( sda ) and are reflected specularly toward the upstream region .",
    "those reflected particles can be scattered back to the shock surface by plasma waves excited in the upstream region , and then undergo multiple cycles of sda , resulting in a power - law type suprathermal population up to @xmath25 .",
    "these studies suggest a possibility that `` self pre - acceleration '' of thermal electrons to suprathermal energies via kinetic plasma processes at the shock itself might provide seed electrons enough to explain the observed flux level of bright radio relics .",
    "the morphology of radio relics is , in some cases , observed to be elongated and arc - like with a sharp edge on one side . and",
    "some of radio relics are found as a pair in the opposite side of clusters .",
    "so they are often interpreted as products of binary mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several numerical studies have suggested that merger shocks with sufficient amount of shock kinetic energy flux could produce radio relics @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "synthetic radio maps were constructed by identifying shocks in simulated clusters and modeling cr electron injection / acceleration and magnetic field strength .",
    "however , there remain a few issues to be resolved , before the simple picture of merger shocks being the origin of radio relics is accepted .",
    "the first issue concerns the frequency of observed radio relics .",
    "although structure formation simulations have demonstrated that shocks are produced frequently during mergers and they should last for the cluster dynamical time of @xmath26  gyr , only about @xmath27 of x - ray luminous clusters host some radio relics , putative merger shocks , and the fraction of merging clusters with giant radio relics is even much lower @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that icm shocks may light up as radio relics only when they encounter fossil relativistic electrons that are left over from either a previous episode of shock / turbulence acceleration or a radio jet from agn @xcite . in such a scenario , only a small faction of icm shocks become radio - emitting structures for a fraction of the dynamical time ( @xmath28  myr ) . so the rareness of radio relics could be explained .",
    "of course , this model can be justified only if the injection and acceleration of electrons at weak shocks in the icm is very inefficient , so that the re - acceleration of pre - existing cr electrons must be required for the birth of radio relics .",
    "the second issue involves the discrepancies in the shock properties inferred from radio and x - ray observations of a few radio relics . among several dozens of observed radio relics , only a fraction of shocks associated with them",
    "also have been detected in x - ray observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the case of the toothbrush relic in 1rxs j0603.3 , for exmaple , the radio index was measured to be @xmath29 , indicating a ` radio mach number ' , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "but the temperature and density discontinuities in x - ray observations suggest an ` x - ray mach number ' , @xmath31 , and the position of shock identified in x - ray observations is shifted from that in radio observations by @xmath32 kpc @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested that for the radio relic in a2256 , if the observed index @xmath33 measured between 63 and 1360  mhz is interpreted as the injection index , the radio mach number can be estimated to be @xmath34 , while the temperature jump measured in x - ray observations implies the x - ray mach number , @xmath35 . in the case of the sausage relic in ciza j2242.8 , @xcite used the observed radio spectral index near the edge ( shock surface ) , @xmath36 , to obtain a radio - inferred shock mach number , @xmath37 . but x - ray - inferred mach number reported later by suzaku and chandra observations turned out to be lower with @xmath38 @xcite . recently , however , @xcite estimated a steeper value , @xmath39 , by performing a spatially - resolved spectral fitting , implying a weaker shock with @xmath40 in good agreement with x - ray observations .    in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter , paper i ) , we studied properties of shock waves in the outskirts of simulated galaxy clusters using sets of lss formation simulations .",
    "we find that in addition to merger shocks , infall shocks are produced in icms by continuous infall of density clumps ( i.e. minor mergers ) along filaments of galaxies to hot icms .",
    "unlike weak bow shocks ( @xmath0 ) driven by major mergers , infall shocks do not show pairing structures and have higher mach numbers ( @xmath41 ) . in a few cases ( e.g. , coma 1253 + 275 and ngc 1265 ) , observed radio relics",
    "are thought to be associated with infall shocks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a scenario in which suprathermal electrons are injected directly at the shocks without a help of fossil cr electrons , and accelerated to radio - emitting energies .",
    "then the frequency of radio relics depends on the shock statistics , while the radio luminosity of radio relics is determined by the shock kinetic energy flux and the assumed dsa efficiency model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this scenario",
    "the rareness of radio relics , compared to the frequency of the icm shocks , can be controlled by adjusting the models for the dsa acceleration efficiency and the magnetic field amplification .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed , using structure formation simulations and generating mock radio maps of simulated cluster samples , that radio emission tends to increase toward the cluster periphery and peak around @xmath42 , mainly because the kinetic energy dissipated at shocks peaks around @xmath43 and the mach number of shocks tend to increase toward the cluster outskirts .",
    "such findings can explain why radio relics are rarely found in the cluster central regions .",
    "we study the properties of radio and x - ray shocks in the simulated cluster sample of paper i , based on a dsa model in which suprathermal electrons are injected and accelerated preferentially at shocks with higher mach numbers .",
    "we first calculate synchrotron emission at shocks by modeling primary cr electron population based on recent dsa simulations @xcite and magnetic field distribution based on a turbulent dynamo model @xcite .",
    "we produce mock radio and x - ray maps by projecting the synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission , respectively .",
    "we then identify `` synthetic radio relics '' in the radio map and extract their properties , such as radio and x - ray shock mach numbers , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and their locations in the map .",
    "we examine the radio and x - ray properties of relic shocks , and attempt to understand discrepancies derived from radio and x - ray observations in some radio relics .    in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we present numerical details such as the calculation of synchrotron emission at shock , the construction of mock radio and x - ray maps , and the extraction of radio and x - ray shock mach numbers . in section  [ sec : projection ] , we discuss how the two - dimensional ( 2d ) projection of three - dimensional ( 3d ) shock distributions affects the radio and x - ray observations of icm shocks . in section  [ sec :",

    "summary follows in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the construction of galaxy cluster sample and the identification of shocks are described in detail in paper i , so here they are summarized only briefly .",
    "the lss formation simulations adopted a standard @xmath46cdm model with the following parameters : baryon density fraction @xmath47 , dark matter density fraction @xmath48 , cosmological constant fraction @xmath49 , hubble parameter @xmath50 , rms density fluctuation @xmath51 , and the primordial spectral index @xmath52 .",
    "an updated version of a particle - mesh / eulerian hydrodynamic code described in @xcite was used for the simulations .",
    "three sets of simulations were performed : ( 1 ) 16 different realizations of lss formation in a comoving cubic box of @xmath53 with @xmath54 uniform grid zones , ( 2 ) 16 different realizations in a comoving cubic box of @xmath55 with @xmath54 zones , and ( 3 ) one realizations in a comoving cubic box of @xmath53 with @xmath56 zones .",

    "here , @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant    shocks ( actually , shock zones ) are identified by a set of criteria given in paper i , and their sonic mach numbers , @xmath11 , are estimated from the temperature jump condition , @xmath65 @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the gas temperature .",
    "hereafter , the subscripts `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' indicate the preshock and postshock quantities , respectively . only shocks with @xmath68",
    "are considered .",
    "note that a shock surface normally consists of many of these shock zones .",
    "the shock speed and shock kinetic energy flux at shock zone are , then , calculated as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , where @xmath71 is the preshock thermal pressure and @xmath72 is the gas adiabatic index .",

    "for the efficiency , the values presented in @xcite ( also shown in figure 2 of paper i ) are adopted .    in paper",
    "i , we find that the morphology of shock surfaces is quite complex due to the dynamic history of clusters , and in general a connected shock surface can consist of a number of grid zones of different types of shocks including merger shocks ( see figure 7 in paper i ) .      to calculate radio synchrotron emission at cluster shocks , we need to model the strength of magnetic fields as well as the energy spectrum of cr electrons .",
    "the icm is observed to be permeated with magnetic fields of a few @xmath75 g in the cluster core region and a few @xmath76 g in the cluster periphery ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we adopt the turbulent dynamo model of @xcite , which assumes that turbulent flow motions are induced via stretching and compression of the vorticity generated behind curved surfaces of shocks in clusters , and the magnetic fields are amplified by the turbulent flows .",
    "then the strength of the resulting magnetic fields can be modeled in terms of the number of local eddy turn - over by the following fitting formula : @xmath77 & \\textrm { for } t / t_{\\rm eddy } < 4 \\\\      ( 0.36/41 ) \\cdot ( t / t_{\\rm eddy}-4 ) + 0.04 & \\textrm { for } t / t_{\\rm eddy } > 4 \\end{array } \\right . , \\label{bdynamo}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the turbulent energy density and @xmath79 is the reciprocal of the vorticity calculated from the local flow speed .",
    "the fitting function @xmath80 represents the fraction of the turbulent energy transferred to the magnetic energy via turbulent dynamo , and it is derived from a magneto - hydrodynamic simulation @xcite .",

    "this is in a good agreement with the observed magnetic field strength in actual clusters .      for the energy spectrum of cr electrons",
    ", we first assume that the cr acceleration at shock is described by the test - particle model @xcite , since most of the shocks found in clusters are weak ( see introduction ) .",
    "then , the momentum distribution of cr protons at the shock position is described by the power - law form for @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the dimensionless proton momentum , @xmath86 is the proton mass , and @xmath87 is the spectral index .",

    "the normalization factor @xmath89 at each shock zone is determined by setting the cr energy flux through the shock zone as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the postshock flow speed and @xmath92 is given in equation ( [ fcrp ] ) .",
    "we do _ not _ consider the re - acceleration of pre - existing crs in this work .",
    "here , @xmath93 is the injection momentum above which particles can participate in the dsa process .",
    "according to recent pic and hybrid simulations , both protons and electrons initially can gain energies via sda while confined between the shock front and the preshock region by scatterings due to self - generated upstream waves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see introduction ) .",
    "particles should have the rigidity ( @xmath94 ) large enough to cross the shock front , i.e. , @xmath95 , in order to take part in the full first - order fermi process .",
    "here , @xmath96 is the most probable momentum of thermal protons of postshock gas with temperature @xmath97 , while the most probable momentum of thermal electrons is @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , @xmath98 is expected to depend on the shock mach number , obliquity angle , and shock speed . here , for the sake of simplicity , we set @xmath99 in all shock zones regardless of the shock speed and mach number and the icm temperature .",
    "since the dsa process operates on cr protons and electrons with the same rigidity in the same manner , the momentum distribution of primary cr electrons at shocks should follow that of cr protons , except less efficient injection and radiative cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the injection rate of cr electrons is expected be much lower than that of cr protons , because postshock thermal electrons need to be pre - accelerated from the thermal momentum to @xmath98 in order to get injected into the dsa process . since the electron pre - acceleration is not yet fully constrained by plasma physics ( despite of recent pic simulations , see introduction ) , it is often parameterized by the cr electron - to - proton ratio , @xmath100 .",
    "different types of observations have indicated a wide range of @xmath101 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so we adopt the cr electron momentum distribution of @xmath102 for @xmath83 with @xmath103 . adopting a higher value of @xmath100 , as suggested in some recent pic simulations @xcite ,",
    "will increase the amplitude of @xmath104 and therefore the synchrotron radiation flux uniformly for all shocks .    at the same time of gaining energy via the dsa process at shock ,",
    "cr electrons lose energy via synchrotron emission and ic scattering . as a results ,",
    "an equilibrium momentum exists where the momentum gain is balanced by the radiative losses",
    "@xcite : @xmath105^{1/2},\\ ] ] where all the quantities except @xmath106 are expressed in cgs units and the electron equilibrium momentum is normalized as @xmath107 .",
    "here , @xmath108 takes account for the loss due to ic scattering of cosmic background photons ( @xmath109 ) as well as the synchrotron loss .",
    "then , the cr electron spectrum _ at the shock location _ has the form of @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "as the primary cr electrons are advected downstream in the postshock region , they also lose energy with the cooling time @xmath111 .",
    "so the cutoff momentum due to radiative losses decreases with the postshock distance ( @xmath112 ) away from the shock front as @xmath113 . as a result ,",
    "the downstream , integrated electron spectrum steepens by one power of @xmath114 as @xmath115 for @xmath116 , where the ` break ' momentum , @xmath117 is the lowest momentum up to which the postshock cr electrons have cooled down . in our simulation sample",

    "the advection time for cr electrons to pass such thickness is @xmath120 for @xmath121 , which is of the order of the dynamical time of typical clusters or the merger time .",
    "for the cr electrons emitting at ghz in @xmath75 g magnetic field ( @xmath122 ) , the cooling time becomes shorter than the advection time ( @xmath123 ) , so they have cooled down before existing the shock zone .",

    "modifications to models for those will lead to rescaling of synchrotron radiation flux .",
    "so these may affect quantitatively some of the shock properties in the flux - limited , mock sample of radio relics , because a radio relic will consist of multiple shocks in the projected maps ( see section 2.4 ) .",

    "however , this practice is justified only when the break momentum of the volume - integrated electron spectrum is @xmath170 , that is , when the break frequency in the integrated radio spectrum is @xmath171  mhz .    for the calculation of @xmath172 ,",

    "again , only x - ray shocks with @xmath179 are considered .",
    "note that a pixel identified as x - ray shock may not be a ` radio pixel ' and vice versa .",
    "in fact , only a small fraction ( @xmath180 ) of radio pixels are identified as x - ray shocks .",
    "although the fraction may differ in real observations , this suggests that x - ray observations could miss a substantial fraction of radio shocks .",
    "since it is caused by the smoothing in projection , this problem may be difficult to be overcome , even if the angular resolution of x - ray observation is improved .",
    "in this section , we examine how the projection affects the radio / x - ray observations of shocks such as the morphologies and derived shock parameters . as a representative example , we consider a cluster from @xmath61 box simulation with @xmath56 grid zones .",
    "this cluster is identical to the one appeared in the left panels of figures 1 and also in figure 7 of paper i. it has the x - ray emission - weighted temperature @xmath181 kev and @xmath182 .",
    "the shock that produces the largest amount of cr protons in this cluster is an infall shock with @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( see paper i ) .    figure  [ fig : map ] shows projected maps of the cluster , viewed from four different angles , zoomed around the area of @xmath185 ( dashed circle ) , where @xmath186 is the distance from the cluster center in the projected plane . here , the synchrotron flux , @xmath158 , is shown as contours of black solid lines , which is superposed with the bolometric x - ray surface brightness , @xmath187 , in gray - scale .",

    "the four maps in figure  [ fig : map ] exhibit morphologies of radio structures , distinct from each other .",
    "for instance , the radio map in the upper - left panel seems to show a paired structures on the opposite side of the cluster , which could be interpreted as radio relics due to a pair of merger shocks . here",
    ", we tag the radio pixels associated with the left structure as `` l - relic '' ( red color ) , while those associated with the right structure as `` r - relic '' ( green color ) .",
    "in other three panels , if the shock zone with the largest synchrotron contribution along a given los belong to either l - relic or r - relic , we color the corresponding radio pixel as red or green , respectively . in the upper - right and lower - left panels ,",
    "elongated radio structures with length @xmath189 are composed of both red ( l - relic ) and green ( r - relic ) pixels .",
    "this illustrates that even a single connected radio structure in the sky may consist of a number of disconnected shock surfaces in the real 3d volume .",
    "so it could be misleading , if we try to extract the nature of underlying shocks only from the morphology or shock parameters inferred from radio observations .",
    "the radio map in the lower - right panel , on the other hand , has a number of small structures , and the structure located near the center could be interpreted as so - called `` radio mini - halo '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) . here",
    ", we do not intend to address the natures of observed paired structures or halo - like structures in detail , but we just point that the morphology of observed radio structures critically depends on the projection of underlying 3d structures .    in figure",
    "[ fig : slice ] , we compare the spatial distributions of @xmath67 , @xmath190 , and @xmath11 in a slice ( left panels ) with those of @xmath191 , @xmath166 , and @xmath172 in 2d projection ( right panels ) .",
    "the slice passes through @xmath192 away from the cluster center , and contains the most radio - luminous shock zones for the l and r - relics , which are projected at @xmath193 @xmath194 and @xmath195 @xmath196 in the 2d maps , respectively .",
    "they are identified as infall shocks with @xmath197 for l - relic and @xmath198 for r - relic .",
    "the right panels are from the same map as that for the upper - left panel of figure  [ fig : map ] , and the contours are drawn with the level of @xmath199 . for @xmath166 , only pixels with @xmath200 are plotted , while for @xmath191 and @xmath172 , only pixels with @xmath201 are plotted .",
    "note that the bolometric x - ray surface brightness in outskirts near @xmath202 ranges typically @xmath203 in observed clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "comparison of @xmath11 in the slice map ( left - bottom ) and @xmath166 in the 2d map ( right - middle ) indicates that the mach number and location of shocks with @xmath204 agree well in the two distributions , especially for the shocks associated with l - relic .",
    "this is because the radio spectrum in projected maps is governed by one or a few radio - luminous shock zones with high mach numbers in a given los .",
    "so @xmath166 derived from radio observations could be a good proxy for the mach number of radio - luminous shocks , implying that the properties of such shocks could be extracted reasonably well from radio observations .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are noticeable differences between the distributions of @xmath67/@xmath11 in the slice maps ( left - top / bottom ) and those of @xmath191/@xmath172 in the 2d maps ( right - top / bottom ) . as seen in top panels , the distribution of @xmath191 is smoother than that of @xmath67 , partly because the contribution from the x - ray bright icm dominates over the emissions from the whim in surrounding filaments , and also because the projection ( integration along loss ) inevitably irons out any sharp features .",
    "the temperature jump across a shock in the @xmath191 map looks reduced .",
    "we find that @xmath172 derived from x - ray observations tends to underestimate the actual shock mach number ( see the next chapter ) .",
    "we further examine in detail the region near l - relic , where the slice maps indicate a shock of @xmath205 formed by the infall of the whim along a filament .",
    "there is @xmath206 of positional shift between the locations of shocks in the @xmath166 ( right - middle ) and @xmath172 ( right - bottom ) maps .",
    "this is because @xmath166 picks up the infall shock , while due to the dominant contribution of x - ray from the hot and dense icm along the los , @xmath172 picks up a foreground shock with smaller mach number formed in the icm ( sse below ) .",
    "this may explain spatial offsets between the shock surfaces inferred from radio and x - ray observations in some radio relics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig:3d ] shows the distributions of radio and x - ray emissivities , @xmath157 and @xmath144 , as functions of @xmath11 for shocks within @xmath185 in our simulated clusters .",
    "both distributions have rather large spreads , but the following points are clear , firstly , @xmath144 decreases with increasing @xmath11 , while @xmath157 increases with @xmath11 , peaks at @xmath207 and decreases slightly for higher @xmath11 .",
    "these behaviors can be understood as follows .",
    "weaker shocks which tend to form in hot and dense regions near the cluster core produce more @xmath144 , while shocks formed in cluster outskirts with @xmath208 several accelerate crs and produce @xmath157 most efficiently .",
    "secondly , on average , @xmath144 varies over two orders of magnitude , while @xmath157 varies over 10 orders of magnitude .",
    "although both radio / x - ray surface brightnesses on projected maps are dominated by contributions from a small number of bright shock zones along each los , the tendency is much stronger in the case of radio .",
    "in this section , we first examine the surface brightnesses and derived mach numbers of pixels with shocks , i.e @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 , obtained in projected radio / x - ray maps .",
    "as noted in section 2.5 , radio pixels which contain shocks in radio maps may not be identified as shocks in x - ray maps , and vice versa .",
    "so when we study a correlation between any two quantities , for instance , @xmath166 versus @xmath172 , we use a subset of pixels in which both quantities are specified .",
    "figure  [ fig : xlum_sync_mach_all ] displays the relations between @xmath209 vs @xmath211 , @xmath166 vs @xmath209 , and @xmath172 vs @xmath211 for pixels within @xmath185 from the cluster center .",
    "the bottom panel shows that bright x - ray shocks with large @xmath211 tend to be weak with small @xmath172 ; the brightest x - ray shocks have @xmath213 .",
    "the middle panel , on the other hand , shows that the synchrotron flux @xmath209 of radio pixels increases with @xmath166 up to @xmath214 and then decreases for larger @xmath166 .",
    "these behaviors should be guessed from those of @xmath157 and @xmath144 shown in figure  [ fig:3d ] . as a result ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath209 and @xmath187 turns out to be rather poor with wide variations in the top panel .",
    "what is clear is that the shocks which are brightest in radio are not necessarily brightest in x - ray . as a matter of fact ,",
    "brightest x - ray shocks have modest radio brightnesses , and vice verse .",
    "figure  [ fig : machs_all ] displays the relations among mock - observed mach numbers , @xmath166 and @xmath172 , and weighted mach numbers , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , for pixels within @xmath185 . as noted in the previous chapter ,",
    "the x - ray mach numbers tend to be smaller than the radio mach numbers ( upper panels ) .",
    "again , this is mainly because x - ray observations incline to pick up weaker shocks than radio observations along given loss .",
    "the correlation between @xmath210 and @xmath212 is rather poor ; the pearson s linear correlation coefficient of @xmath166 and @xmath172 is @xmath217 ( upper - left panel ) and that of @xmath215 and @xmath216 is @xmath218 ( upper - right panel ) .",
    "so it could be misleading if @xmath172 is guessed from @xmath166 , and vice versa .",
    "it is expected that @xmath219 and @xmath220 for the same band are correlated better .",
    "we find that @xmath166 is often smaller than @xmath215 as shown in the lower - left panel , but the correlation between them is quite good with @xmath221 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath172 and @xmath216 in the lower - right panel , on the other hand , is still poor with @xmath222 .",
    "this demonstrates that the smoothing in projection would make the estimation of shock properties harder in x - ray observations than in radio observations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rad_all ] , we examine the radial distributions of observable properties of shock pixels .",
    "both @xmath166 and @xmath172 tend to increase with radius , and @xmath166 shows a larger variance than @xmath172 .",
    "shocks with x - ray mach number @xmath223 a few would be rare within @xmath185 , while shocks with radio mach number @xmath166 up to several could be found .",
    "radio bright shocks , for instance , those with @xmath224 , are found mostly in @xmath225 .",
    "this suggests that future radio observations could detect many more shock structures in cluster outskirts . on the other hand , x - ray bright shocks",
    "are preferentially located and so found close the center .",
    "the bolometric x - ray surface brightness of x - ray shocks follows @xmath226 with @xmath227 for @xmath228 , which is consistent with the observed x - ray profiles in cluster outskirts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we build up a catalog of `` synthetic radio relics '' by finding connected structures in our radio maps , which meet the following conditions .",
    "( 1 ) all pixels within structures have @xmath229 .",
    "( 2 ) a structure has at least five pixels .",
    "note that the area of a single pixel is @xmath230 ( @xmath231 or @xmath232 ) .",
    "so five pixels corresponds to , for instance , @xmath233 in simulations of @xmath234 box with @xmath54 grid zones . using these conditions , we have 9583 radio relics samples : 4626 from simulations of @xmath234 with @xmath54 grid zones , 4850 from simulations of @xmath235 with @xmath54 grid zones , and 107 from simulation of @xmath234 with @xmath56 grid zones .",
    "we then assign the following quantities to synthetic radio relics .",
    "the average distance from the cluster center , @xmath236 , is defined by the synchrotron - weighted average of the distance of the pixels that belong to a radio relic , @xmath237 , where @xmath186 is the distance of pixels from the cluster center .",
    "the derived mach numbers of radio relics are defined by the synchrotron / x - ray weighted averages of the corresponding derived mach numbers of pixels , @xmath166 , @xmath215 , @xmath172 , and @xmath216 .",
    "for example , @xmath238 and @xmath239 . the number of pixels with @xmath172 could be smaller than that with @xmath166 , since @xmath172 is specified only at the pixels identified as x - ray shocks .",
    "in fact , about 40% of sample radio relics contain no pixel with @xmath172 , so the corresponding x - ray mach number is not assigned to them .",
    "the synchrotron power at 1.4 ghz and bolometric x - ray luminosity of a radio relic are calculated with @xmath240 and @xmath241 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : machs_relic ] displays the relations among the derived mach numbers for sample radio relics .",
    "the relations follow and so look similar to those for pixels in projected maps shown in figure  [ fig : machs_all ] , but the correlations are tighter with @xmath242 @xmath243 @xmath244 , @xmath245 @xmath246 @xmath247 , @xmath242 @xmath248 @xmath249 , and @xmath250 @xmath251)@xmath252 . especially , the correlation between @xmath253 and @xmath254 is very good , indicating that the mach number estimated from radio spectral index would be a fair representation of suitably averaged mach number of shocks associated with radio relics .",
    "most of our sample radio relics have @xmath255 .",
    "this is partly because with the model cr acceleration efficiency we employ @xcite , the amount of cr electrons emitting synchrotron is very small for weak shocks with @xmath256 ( see figure 3 of paper i ) .",
    "if the cr electron acceleration at weak shocks would be more efficient than in our model , radio relics with smaller @xmath253 could be more common .",
    "as noted in introduction , merger shocks are expected to have mostly @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , we find that our synthetic radio relics normally involve projections of multiple shocks along loss , resulting in different morphologies for different viewing angles ( see figure  [ fig : map ] ) . in @xmath257 of sample radio relics , the brightest pixels with largest @xmath209 include infall shocks along loss , suggesting that infall shocks may account for some radio relics with flat spectra .",
    "this seems reasonable in the sense that infall shocks could be the major sources of crs in clusters , as discussed in paper i.    figure  [ fig : rad_relic ] displays the radial distributions of @xmath253 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "upper panels show that most of our synthetic radio relics are found at @xmath261 .",
    "although there are wide variations , @xmath253 and @xmath258 tend to increase toward outskirts , and on average the radio mach number is larger than the x - ray mach number .",
    "the lower - left panel shows that the radio power at a given radial distance can vary widely , yet most powerful radio relics are found at @xmath262 .",
    "this results mainly from the combined effects of the radial distribution of shock kinetic energy flux and @xmath11 , the strong dependence of cr acceleration efficiency on @xmath11 , and the geometrical increase of relic surface area toward outskirts ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the lower - right panel shows a strong radial decline of the bolometric x - ray luminosity of sample radio relics ( not including the contributions from the background icm ) toward outskirts .",
    "this reflects mostly the radial decreases of gas density and temperature ; the effect of the increase of the mach number and relic surface area is not large here .",
    "we compare our synthetic radio relics with observed radio relics .",
    "table 1 lists the properties of the observed radio relics we use ; here , @xmath263 is the redshift of associated clusters , @xmath264 is the largest linear scale on the sky , and @xmath265 is the integrated radio spectral index . they are chosen from @xcite and @xcite with the following criteria ; ( 1 ) @xmath266 ( our radio relic sample is constructed at @xmath154 ) , ( 2 ) @xmath267 with @xmath268 , and ( 3 ) both @xmath259 and @xmath265 available .",
    "note that @xmath265 in table 1 was calculated between @xmath269 mhz and @xmath270 ghz .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , here we ignore the effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : relic ] shows @xmath259 vs @xmath236 and @xmath265 for synthetic ( colors ) and observed ( filled squares ) radio relics .",
    "the distribution of @xmath259 of observed radio relics seems to fall within the range predicted by our synthetic observation .",
    "on the other hand , there are noticeable differences in the distributions of @xmath236 and @xmath265 between synthetic and observed radio relics .",
    "first , four observed radio relics are found with @xmath272 mpc among twelve , while the fraction of synthetic radio relics with @xmath272 mpc is very small , less than @xmath273 .",
    "second , while the integrated spectral index of synthetic radio relics lies @xmath274 ( corresponding to @xmath275 ) , some of observed radio relics have steeper spectral indices . for example , the radio relics found at abell 548b b and abell s753 have @xmath276 ( @xmath277 ) , and the radio relic at abell 2345w has @xmath278 ( @xmath279 ) . the discrepancies could be partly because weak shocks close to cluster core might be under - represented in our structure formation simulations due to the limited spatial resolution and omission of some non - gravitational processes .",
    "but it could be also possible that weak shocks accelerate cr electrons more efficiently than we assume here , as hinted in recent pic simulations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand , the re - acceleration of `` pre - existing '' cr electrons , which is not considered in this study , could play an important role in the production of cr electrons at weak shocks with @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "especially , if fossil relativistic electrons are present in the form of isolated clouds , instead of being spread throughout the general icm space , the relative rareness of radio relics can be understood , as discussed in the introduction @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , ` lighting - up ' of radio relics is governed mainly by the occasional encounters of icm shocks with fossil electron clouds , instead of the mach - number - dependent dsa efficiency and the shock kinetic energy flux . as a result",
    ", the frequency and radio luminosity of radio relics may depend less sensitively on the shock mach number , and much weaker shocks could be turned on as radio relics with steeper spectral index .",
    "these features are more consistent with the observational data in figure 9 .",
    "moreover , only a small fraction of icm shocks become radio sources for the period much shorter than the cluster dynamical time sale @xcite .",
    "so the model naturally explains why radio relics are rare , while structure formation simulations predict shocks should be ubiquitous in the icm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the exploration of this scenario requires extensions of the models we employ here , so beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the existence of shocks in clusters of galaxies has been established through observations of radio relics due to synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated cr electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as through x - ray observations of shock discontinuities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not clear whether the properties of shocks inferred from radio and x - ray observations represent their true nature , because we can only measure the quantities projected onto the sky , integrated along loss .",
    "in fact , for a few relics such as the tooth brush relic and the radio relic in a2256 , radio and x - ray observations have reported inconsistencies in quantities such as shock mach number and position @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explored a scenario in which electrons freshly injected and accelerated to high energies via dsa process at the structure formation shocks produce radio relics .",
    "we constructed synthetic maps of galaxy clusters in radio and x - ray by employing the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation data reported earlier in paper i. first , the volume - averaged synchrotron emissivity at shock zones was calculated by adopting the cr electron acceleration efficiency based on a dsa model @xcite and magnetic fields based on a turbulent dynamo model @xcite .",
    "the bolometric x - ray emissivity at grid zones was also calculated using the gas density and temperature from simulations .",
    "then , mock maps of the synchrotron and x - ray surface brightnesses in 2d projection were produced by integrating volume emissivities along loss for simulated clusters . in the synthetic maps ,",
    "the properties of shocks and radio relics , such as the shock mach number and location , were examined in detail .",
    "\\1 ) in most cases , radio and x - ray shocks in 2d maps are the outcomes of projection of multiple shock surfaces along loss , because shocks are abundant in the icm with a mean separation of shock surfaces , @xmath280 . as a result ,",
    "the morphology of shock distributions in 2d maps depends on the projection direction ; for the same cluster , very different morphologies may turn out for different viewing angles .",
    "\\2 ) synchrotron emissivity depends sensitively on the shock mach number , especially with our dsa model for the cr electron acceleration , while bremsstrahlung emissivity depends on the gas density and temperature .",
    "hence , radio observations tend to pick up shocks of @xmath208 a few to several along a los , while x - ray observations preferentially select weaker shocks ( @xmath0 ) with high density and temperature .",
    "consequently , the properties of shocks in 2d projected maps could be different in radio and x - ray observations .",
    "the shock mach number estimated with x - ray observations tends to be smaller than that from radio observations , if a radio relic consists of multiple shocks along loss .",
    "in addition , the location of shocks from x - ray observations could be shifted with respect to that from radio observations .",
    "\\3 ) for radio relics , the mach number estimated from the radio spectral index seems to be a fair representation of suitably averaged mach number of shock surfaces associated with them . on the other hand , the discontinuities in x - ray temperature tend to be smeared due to projection effects including possible multiple shocks and multiple icm components , resulting in the x - ray mach number lower than the real mach number of the associated shock .",
    "\\4 ) when the properties of our synthetic radio relics are compared with those of observed radio relics , there are clear differences in the statistics of radial location and spectral index ; more radio relics have been observed closer to the cluster core and with steeper spectral indices than our synthetic observation predicts .",
    "this discrepancy may imply that weak shocks in high beta plasmas in fact accelerate cr electrons more efficiently than we model here ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , as shown in the previous studies of @xcite and @xcite , the re - acceleration of pre - existing electrons in the icm may enhance the production of cr electrons at weak shocks with @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we could also conjecture that radio relics might be activated only when shocks encounter clouds , which contain fossil electrons either accelerated earlier by shocks / turbulence or left over from old radio jets ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model may explain how very weak shocks can turn on the synchrotron emission and why radio relics are rare relative to putative shocks in galaxy clusters .",

    "<S> radio relics detected in the outskirts of galaxy clusters are thought to trace radio - emitting relativistic electrons accelerated at cosmological shocks . in this study , using the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation data for the large - scale structure formation and adopting a diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) model for the production of cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons , we construct mock radio and x - ray maps of simulated galaxy clusters that are projected in the sky plane . </S>",
    "<S> various properties of shocks and radio relics , including the shock mach number , radio spectral index and luminosity are extracted from the synthetic maps and compared with observations . </S>",
    "<S> a substantial fraction of radio and x - ray shocks identified in these maps involve multiple shock surfaces along line of sights ( loss ) , and the morphology of shock distributions in the maps depends on the projection direction . among multiple shocks in a given los , </S>",
    "<S> radio observations tend to pick up stronger shocks with flatter radio spectra , while x - ray observations preferentially select weaker shocks with larger kinetic energy flux . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the shock mach numbers and locations derived from radio and x - ray observations could differ from each other in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the distributions of the spectral index and radio power of the synthetic radio relics are somewhat inconsistent with those of observed real relics ; a bit more radio relics have been observed closer to the cluster core and with steeper spectral indices . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the inconsistency could be explained , if very weak shocks with @xmath0 accelerate cr electrons more efficiently , compared to the dsa model adopted here . </S>"
