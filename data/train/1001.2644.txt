    ", we performed a timing analysis over the entire enhancement interval .",
    "we first eliminated the times of all the bursts found via our untriggered burst search and converted the remaining burst - free intervals to the solar system barycenter .",
    "we then generated a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite over a range of periods from 0.1  s to 10  s using ctime burst data in the 50@xmath0102  kev band .",
    "we found a very significant signal with a lomb power of 72.6 ( chance occurrence probability , p@xmath15 ) at a period of 2.0699  @xmath16  0.0024  s , which is consistent with the spin period of .",
    "further , to confirm our detection , we also employed the z@xmath17@xmath18 test ( with m = 2 ) @xcite on the burst - free and barycentered tte data .",

    "our spin period measurement is consistent with the one found for  using contemporaneous x - ray data ( _ swift_/xrt ) @xcite and radio data @xcite .",
    "therefore , we clearly confirm with the detection of these hard x - ray pulsations that the enhanced persistent emission seen in the inset of figure  [ fig : lc_ch14 ] originates from .",
    "next we searched in the enhanced persistent emission for evolution in the intensity of the pulsations using a sliding boxcar technique .",
    "we found that the pulsed signal peaks over a 90  s interval , from @xmath11@xmath21 to @xmath22  s , which encompasses the peak of the enhancement . finally , we searched for any other intervals exhibiting pulsed emission in the burst - free continuous ctime data of 2009 january 22 and during the four subsequent days , using a sliding boxcar of 120 s with 10 s steps .",

    "we estimated the background level using the data segment between @xmath11  to @xmath11 + 60  s. figure  [ fig : pptte ] shows the source pulse profiles during the enhanced emission interval in six energy bands that have the same logarithmic width .",

    "this pulse becomes equally prominent in the 22@xmath033 kev range and then dominates in the 33@xmath050 kev band .",
    "the pulse profile changes remarkably in the 50 - 74 kev band , which is the most statistically significant of all the energy bands investigated , and is distinguished by a broad structure that peaks at around phase 0.0 .",
    "the 74@xmath0110  kev profile resembles the 50 - 74 kev one . as noted above",
    ", the pulse profile above 110  kev is consistent with random fluctuations .",
    "therefore , our results set an observed upper energy bound of 110  kev for the hard x - ray pulsations in  during this enhanced emission episode .",
    "we computed the rms pulsed fraction using a fourier based approach as described in @xcite . in summary , we take the fourier transform of each pulse profile , then we calculate the rms pulsed flux by taking the fourier coefficients of up to third harmonic into account , and finally obtain the pulsed fraction values by dividing the rms pulsed flux by the phase - averaged flux . in figure",
    "[ fig : pfall ] , we show the pulsed fraction spectrum of  in the same energy bands as in figure  [ fig : pptte ] .    .",
    "the energy bands are the same as those used in figure  [ fig : pptte ] .",
    "[ fig : pfall],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    although marginally significant , there is an indication of a minimum in the rms pulsed fraction around @xmath130  kev .",
    "the rms reaches its maximum value of 0.55 @xmath16 0.12 in the 50@xmath074 kev band , and then dips below detection at energies greater than @xmath1110  kev .",
    "we analyzed time - integrated and time - resolved spectra of the enhanced emission , using the cspec burst data ( 8.6@xmath0897  kev ) .",
    "similar to the timing analysis , we excluded all bursts identified with the untriggered search within the enhancement period .    since the detector response matrices ( drms ) of gbm",
    "are time dependent due to the continuous slewing of the spacecraft , a drm should be generated for every 2 - 3 degrees of slewing ( corresponding to every @xmath120@xmath050  s of data ) .",
    "therefore , we generated drms for every 50  s starting from @xmath11 , for this analysis .",
    "we found clear evidence for spectral curvature below 100  kev in the time - integrated spectrum of the entire burst - free enhancement period ( 72@xmath0248  s ) ; a single power law thus resulted in a very poor fit .",
    "we employed five other spectral models ; cut - off power law , power law + blackbody , optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung , and single / double blackbody .",

    "the spin phase for each photon was calculated using barycentered times , as was done for the timing analysis .",
    "we calculated the background spectrum , from the burst - free interval at @xmath11  to @xmath11 + 60  s.    the spectra of both the phase minimum and maximum were adequately fitted with power law + blackbody models , where we kept the power - law indices and the blackbody temperatures linked .",

    "we report here the discovery of coherent pulsations in the persistent hard x - ray emission from  in the _",
    "fermi_/gbm data lasting @xmath1150  s. coherent pulsations with a 55% rms pulse fraction have never been detected in the persistent emission at these high energies from a magnetar as yet .",
    "these pulsations were detected only at the onset of a major bursting episode and were not directly related to a major burst or flare from the source .",
    "previously , intermediate flares with pulsating tails were observed from sgr1900 + 14 @xcite and very recently from  ( @xmath16  hours after @xmath11)@xcite .",
    "thermal components were also found in the decaying tails of intermediate events from sgr1900 + 14 with much lower blackbody temperatures of @xmath12  kev @xcite .",
    "the thermal component of the enhanced emission we report here is hotter ( 17  kev ) , exhibits a strong dependence of the pulse profile with energy with a very high rms pulsed fraction ( up to 55% ) , and is clearly not associated with a decaying event tail .",
    "energetically , however , the fluence of this enhanced emission is comparable to that of tail emission of the intermediate flares from sgr1900 + 14 .",
    "our timing analysis showed that the detection of pulsations is most significant in the 120@xmath0210  s interval after trigger .",
    "we find that the spectrum requires a blackbody component along with a power law between 122@xmath0223  s , which is consistent with the time interval of the most significant detection of pulsations .",
    "moreover , as determined by the energy dependent pulse profiles and rms pulsed fractions , we find that the high - energy pulsations are most significant in the 50@xmath074  kev range . strikingly , the blackbody component of the enhanced persistent emission spectrum peaks at around 51  kev ( i.e. , the wien peak of 17  kev , see figure  [ fig : nufnu ] ) .",
    "these two independent pieces of evidence lend strong support for a blackbody radiation component to account for the curvature in the spectrum of the enhanced emission .    in our spin - phase - resolved spectral analysis",
    ", we find that the blackbody flux to the total emission is ( 52@xmath1618)% and ( 35@xmath1618)% in the phase - maximum and phase - minimum spectra , respectively .",
    "this also suggests that a major contribution to the observed pulsations is from the blackbody component .",
    "if we assume a surface hot - spot during this pulsating interval , then the best - fit blackbody corresponds to an effective radiating area ( as projected on the plane of the sky , far from the star ) of @xmath31 , where @xmath32k ( @xmath33kev ) is the observed ( gravitationally redshifted ) temperature .",
    "we have used here the blackbody flux at the peak of the pulsations ( i.e. , phase maximum ; @xmath34 ) where the hot - spot is expected to be relatively close to face - on , in order to minimize the effects of projection and gravitational lensing by the neutron star , so that @xmath35 would be relatively close to the physical area , @xmath36 , of the hot spot on the neutron star surface . for a circular hot - spot",
    ", this corresponds to a radius of @xmath1120@xmath37 m .",
    "the internal field of magnetars can be significantly stronger and more tangled than the external dipole field . as the internal field twists the stellar crust , the magnetosphere also becomes twisted , possibly in a complex manner  @xcite .",
    "if we identify the inferred size of the hot - spot as the size of a twisted region on the stellar surface , the rate of energy dissipation is expected to be @xmath38 for global stability case @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed luminosity of the spot , @xmath39    it may be possible for the magnetic twist to grow to a global instability level during a highly active bursting period due to frequent starquakes @xcite . as the magnetosphere untwists , a large amount of energy must be dissipated @xcite . a small `` trapped fireball ''  plasma of @xmath40 pairs and photons confined by a closed magnetic field region ",
    "could then potentially account for the inferred hot - spot , and in particular its roughly constant temperature and size .",
    "confining a  fireball \" of energy at least comparable to that emitted by the observed blackbody component , @xmath41erg , within a region of radius @xmath42 m requires @xmath43 or @xmath44 g . this is consistent with the surface dipole field of @xmath45 g inferred from the measured @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "therefore , a sufficiently small closed magnetic loop anchored by the crust could provide the required confinement .",
    "moreover , the blackbody emission is expected to be accompanied by non - thermal , high - energy radiation produced by collisionless dissipation , with the luminosities comparable to the blackbody components @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with our observations of .    in conclusion ,",
    "the area of the blackbody emitting region observed here is the smallest  hot spot \" measured for a magnetar , which likely arises from magnetically confined hot plasma on the neutron star surface , possibly caused by the gradual dissipative untwisting of the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "if the total radiated energy was initially confined to the inferred extremely small size of the enhanced emission region ( as in a mini `` trapped fireball '' scenario ) , this would indicate a very large magnetic energy density , similar to the `` trapped fireball '' model for the tails of sgr giant flares .",
    "the observed enhanced emission that we report here is much less energetic than a giant flare tail , while its energy is comparable to the tail energy of intermediate events and at the high end of typical sgr bursts .",
    "despite some distinct properties , the enhanced emission of  carries various flavors of all three sgr phenomena , and thus it is most likely related to the very pronounced bursting activity that immediately followed it .",
