    "it has been known for a while that very intense electromagnetic fields are created in ultra - relativistic hadronic and nuclear collisions @xcite . however , no convincing experimental evidence of their impact on the scattering dynamics has been observed . in recent years , a renewed interest to this subject",
    "was motivated by the relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are intense enough to modify the properties of the nuclear matter produced in these collisions . in order to evaluate the impact of these fields on the nuclear matter , it is crucial to know their space - time structure . in @xcite production of the electromagnetic fields",
    "was studied using the hadron transport models , neglecting the nuclear medium electric and magnetic response and flow . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that the quantum nature of the nucleus wave function gives rise to strong field fluctuation , so that even in central collisions the r.m.s .",
    "does not vanish .",
    "in @xcite it is argued that due to the finite electric conductivity of nuclear matter , the lifetime of the electromagnetic field is significantly longer than in vacuum .",
    "anomalous transport can also affect the field producing oscillations @xcite and even forcing the field into the topologically non - trivial configurations @xcite . the electromagnetic field in the nuclear medium , unlike that in vacuum",
    ", strongly depends on the initial conditions @xcite . the nuclear medium produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions",
    "is well described by the relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "relativistic magneto - hydrodynamic calculations were done in @xcite in the ideal limit ( infinite electrical conductivity ) .    in a recent publication",
    "@xcite we argued that one can treat the sources of the electromagnetic field , i.e. the valence quarks , neither as point particles ( classical limit ) nor as plane waves , which have infinite spatial extent .",
    "this is because the interaction range , the quark wave function size and the dimensions of the produced nuclear matter have similar extent . as the first step towards understanding the quantum dynamics of the electromagnetic field sources , in @xcite we modeled valence quarks as spinless gaussian wave packets . solving the klein - gordon equation we computed the charge and current densities and the resulting electromagnetic fields in vacuum . in the present work",
    "we extend our approach to compute the spin contribution to the electromagnetic field . as in @xcite",
    "we start with the initial gaussian wave packet and evolve it in time according to the dirac equation . at this point",
    "we completely neglect the medium effects as our goal is to study the effect of quantum diffusion of the quark wave function . this way our calculation is applicable to any hadronic and nuclear collisions .",
    "before we proceed to the description of our calculation , it is worthwhile to set the notations , definitions and normalizations .",

    "in the rest frame , although the particle momentum vanishes , the momentum of the fourier components in ( [ a5 ] ) is finite , which is the reason for the wave function diffusion .",
    "although the particle spin projection on any axis is conserved , only spin projection on the momentum direction is conserved for states with given momentum .",

    "other parameters used in our numerical calculations were the valence quark mass @xmath34  gev , electric charge @xmath35 ( we omit the quark charges 2/3 and -1/3 ) and the boost factor @xmath36 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the results of our calculations are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ all]-fig .",
    "[ bvt ] . shown in fig .",
    "[ all ] is the dependence of the magnetic field on time @xmath37 ( left panel ) and distance @xmath31 ( right panel ) . on the left panel notice that at later time the magnetic field changes sign .",
    "we have observed this effect before for a scalar particle @xcite , where it is , in fact , much more prominent .",
    "we will add a few more comments about the sign flip later in this section .    in fig .",
    "[ bvb ] we plot each of the lines shown in fig .  [ all ] ( left panel ) separately along with its convective and spin components .",
    "also plotted is the corresponding classical ( boosted coulomb ) field for comparison . at large @xmath31 ,",
    "the classical ( i.e.  point ) and quantum ( i.e.  wave packet ) sources induce the same field as expected .",
    "while the convective current contributes to the monopole term falling off as @xmath38 at large @xmath31 , the leading spin current contribution starts with the dipole term which falls off as @xmath39 . at later times , due to the quantum diffusion",
    ", the deviation from the classical field is observed in a wider range of distances .    in fig .",
    "[ bvt ] we plot each of the lines shown in fig .  [ all ] ( right panel ) separately along with its convective and spin components as well as the classical field . in order to better demonstrate the sign flip dynamics we use the linear scale for the vertical axis .",
    "it is seen that while the convective part of the magnetic field changes its sign from positive to negative , the spin part changes its sign from negative to positive at about the same time .",
    "this makes the sign flip effect for the magnetic field generated by spin-1/2 particle less pronounced than for the field generated by a scalar particle ( computed in @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the spin flip can be traced back to ( [ b20 ] ) in which the last two terms are proportional to the rate of decrease of charge density and the corresponding increase of the current density due to the quantum diffusion of the wave packet in the outward radial direction .",
    "we computed the magnetic field created by a single valence quark , which is represented by a wave packet satisfying the dirac equation and moving in free space with relativistic velocity .",
    "we observed that the classical description of the valence quarks as point - particles is not accurate for calculations of the electromagnetic field in hadron and/or nuclear collisions as it breaks down at distances as large as @xmath40  fm at @xmath36 .",
    "moreover it misses an important spin - flip effect that occurs due to the quantum diffusion of the wave packet .",
    "this paper is a step towards our ultimate goal of determining the structure and dynamics of electromagnetic fields created in relativistic hadron and nuclear collisions , and in particular , in heavy - ion collisions . in the forthcoming publication",
    ", we intend to study the effect of the conducting medium on the electromagnetic field created by quantum sources .",
