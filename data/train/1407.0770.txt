    "recently solids with electronic states described by the bloch wave functions , obeying the `` pseudo - relativistic '' dirac equation ( with fermi velocity @xmath8 replacing the velocity of light ) attracted widespread attention .",
    "one outstanding example is graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hexagonal lattice made of carbon atoms",
    ". the effective low energy two - band model ( near its @xmath9 and @xmath10 points in the brillouin zone ) is described by the four - component ( two pseudospins / sublattices and two valleys ) massless 2d dirac hamiltonian ( in fact there are two species of such quasiparticles for each spin ) .",
    "although a similar two - band electronic structure of bismuth was described by a four - component nearly massless dirac fermion in 3d caused by spin - orbit interaction long ago @xcite ( with spin replacing pseudospin ) , only recently several systems were experimentally found to exhibit the 3d dirac quasiparticles .",
    "their discovery followed recent exploration of the topological band theory@xcite .",
    "one of the effective ideas to get a 3d dirac semi - metal is to close the insulating gap by tuning a topological insulator towards the quantum phase transition to trivial insulators when the reflection symmetry is preserved@xcite .",
    "the time reversal invariant 3d dirac point in materials like @xmath11 was theoretically investigated@xcite and experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "a well known compound @xmath12 is a symmetry - protected 3d dirac semimetal with a single pair of dirac points in the bulk and nontrivial fermi arcs on the surface @xcite .",
    "most recently conductivity and magneto - absorption of a zinc - blende crystal , @xmath13 was measured@xcite and is in agreement with theoretical expectations in dirac semimetal @xcite .",
    "ab - initio calculations and symmetry arguments predict@xcite that cristobalite @xmath14 exhibits dirac points at three symmetry related @xmath15 points on the boundary of the fcc brillouin zone .",
    "pyrochlore iridates @xcite and inverse perovskites @xcite were also predicted to be weyl - semimetals .",
    "several known materials with well known magnetic or transport properties have recently undergone a `` delayed '' realization that they are actually dirac semimetals@xcite .",
    "the discovery of the 3d dirac materials makes it possible to study their physics including remarkable electronic properties .",
    "this is rich in new phenomena , not seen in 2d dirac semi - metals like graphene and surface states of topological insulator also harboring 2d weyl quasiparticles .",
    "examples include the giant diamagnetism that diverges logarithmically when the chemical potential approaches the 3d dirac point ; linear - in - frequency ac conductivity that has an imaginary part@xcite ; quantum magnetoresistance showing linear field dependence in the bulk@xcite .",
    "most of the properties of these new materials were measured at relatively high temperatures .",
    "however some of the topological insulators and suspected 3d dirac semi - metals exhibit superconductivity at about the liquid @xmath16 temperature .",
    "the well known topological insulator @xmath17 doped with @xmath18 , becomes superconducting at @xmath19@xcite . at present",
    "its pairing symmetry is unknown . some experimental evidence@xcite point to a conventional phononic pairing mechanism .",
    "the spin independent part of the effective electron - electron interaction due to phonons was studied theoretically@xcite .  for a conventional parabolic dispersion relation ,",
    "typically independent of spin , the phonon mechanism leads to the @xmath20-wave superconductivity .",
    "the layered , non - centrosymmetric heavy element @xmath21 was found to be superconducting @xcite .",
    "its electronic properties like specific heat , electrical resistivity , and magnetic - susceptibility indicate that @xmath21 is a moderately coupled , type - ii bcs superconductor with large electron - phonon coupling constant of @xmath22 .",
    "it was shown theoretically to possess a very asymmetric 3d dirac point created by strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "if the 3d is confirmed , it might indicate that the superconductivity is conventional phonon mediated .",
    "more recently when the @xmath18 doped @xmath17 was subjected to pressure@xcite , @xmath23 increased to @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "quasilinear temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath26 exceeding the orbital and pauli limits for the singlet pairing , points to the triplet superconductivity .",
    "the band structure of the superconducting compounds is apparently not very different from its parent compound @xmath17 , so that one can keep the two band @xmath27 description ( @xmath28 @xmath29 orbitals on the top and bottom layer of the unit cell mixed with its neighboring @xmath30 @xmath29 orbital ) .",
    "electronic - structure calculations of the compound under pressure@xcite reveal a single bulk three - dimensional dirac cone like in @xmath30 with large spin - orbit coupling .",
    "usually the phonon mediated pairing leads to the @xmath20-wave `` conventional '' superconductivity , while the @xmath31-wave pairing in @xmath32 or heavy fermion superconductors like @xmath33 `` unconventional ''",
    "nonphononic mechanism typically hinges on nonlocal interactions .",
    "the case of the dirac semi - metals is very special due to the strong spin dependence of the itinerant electrons effective hamiltonian .",
    "it was pointed out@xcite that in this case the triplet possibility can arise although the triplet gap is smaller than that of the singlet , the difference sometimes is not large for spin independent electron - electron interactions . very recently",
    "the spin dependent part of the phonon induced electron - electron interaction was considered@xcite and it was shown that the singlet is still favored over the triplet pairing . another essential spin dependent effective electron - electron interaction is the stoner exchange among itinerant electrons@xcite leading to ferromagnetism in transition metals . while in the best 3d weyl semimetal candidates it is too small to form a ferromagnetic state , it might be important to determine the nature of the superconducting condensate .",
    "obviously it favors the triplet pairing .",
    "it therefore of importance to clarify theoretically two questions .",
    "( i ) does a conventional phononic superconductivity exist in these materials with just a minute density of states compared even with high @xmath23 cuprates that apparently utilize much more powerful pairing mechanism than phonons offer ? ( ii )",
    "is it possible that phonons in 3d dirac materials lead to triplet pairing that even becomes dominant under certain circumstances ?    in the present paper",
    "we construct the theory of the superconducting transition in 3d dirac semi - metal at arbitrary chemical potential including zero , assuming the local ( probably , but not necessarily , phonon mediated ) pairing .",
    "the possible pairing channels are classified in this rather unusual situation using symmetries of the system .",
    "in contrast to the 2d case , the triplet pairing is not only possible , but for a moderately strong exchange interaction is the preferred channel taking over the more `` conventional '' singlet one .",
    "it turns out that the triplet superconductivity is easier realized in the intriguing case of a small chemical potential .",
    "the superconductivity there is governed by  a quantum critical point ( qcp)@xcite . the concept of qcp at zero temperature and varying doping constitutes a very useful language for describing the microscopic origin of superconductivity in high @xmath23 cuprates and other `` unconventional '' superconductors@xcite .",
    "quantum criticality , although occurring often in 2d ( even in the context of surface superconductivity in topological insulators@xcite ) , is very rare in 3d .",
    "we find and characterize the quantum critical points corresponding to both the singlet and the triplet superconducting transitions .",
    "there are experimental methods to tune the chemical potential by doping ( for example by copper@xcite ) , gating@xcite , pressurepressurebise etc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model of the phonon mediated and exchange effective local interactions of dirac fermion is presented and the method of its solution ( in the gorkov equations form ) including the symmetry analysis of possible pairing channels is given in section ii .",
    "in section iii the phase diagram for spin independent interactions is established and the regions in parameter space where singlet and triplet states are nearly degenerate are identified .",
    "the stoner exchange interaction is considered perturbatively in section iv .",
    "a novel case of zero chemical potential ( qcp ) is studied in section v. section vi contains discussion on experimental feasibility of the phonon mediated surface superconductivity in 3d weyl semi - metals , as well as a comparison with earlier calculations andconclusion .",
    "electrons in the 3d dirac semimetal are described by fields operators @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the valley index ( pseudospin ) for the left / right chirality bands with spin projections taking the values @xmath36 with respect to , for example , @xmath37 axis . to use the dirac ( `` pseudo - relativistic '' ) notations ,",
    "these are combined into a four component bi - spinor creation operator , @xmath38 , whose index @xmath39 takes four values . the non - interacting massless hamiltonian with fermi velocity @xmath8 and chemical potential @xmath0 reads@xcite,@xmath40where three @xmath41 matrices , @xmath42",
    ", @xmath43are presented in the block form via pauli matrices @xmath44 .",
    "they are related to the dirac @xmath45 matrices ( in the chiral representation , sometimes termed `` spinor '' ) by @xmath46 with@xmath47here @xmath48 is @xmath49 identity matrix .",
    "we consider a special case of 3d rotational symmetry that in particular has an isotropic fermi velocity .",
    "moreover we assume the time reversal , @xmath50 , and inversion symmetries although the pseudo lorentz symmetry will be explicitly broken by interactions .",
    "the spectrum of single particle excitations is linear , see fig.1 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath0 is counted from the dirac point .",
    "electrons interact electrostatically via the density - density potential @xmath51:@xmath52 in weyl semi - metals there is no static screening at @xmath7 , although dynamically it is screened within rpa @xcite .",
    "the screening length is therefore not small like in good metals .",
    "however in most materials that realize the dirac semi - metals @xcite , there is a large dielectric constant @xmath53 that allows phonon - electron coupling agd,@xmath54to overpower it to create the cooper pairs as mentioned in introduction . here",
    "@xmath55 denotes the displacement of ions and the electron - ion coupling @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ion mass .",
    "the effective electron - electron interaction due to both electron - phonon attraction and coulomb repulsion ( pseudopotential ) can be generally expanded in derivatives .",
    "the leading term usually called the local ( or the @xmath58-wave pairing ) coupling is    @xmath59    unlike the free hamiltonian @xmath9 , eq.([kinetic ] ) , this interaction hamiltonian does not mix different spin components .",
    "such a coupling implicitly restricts the spin independent local interaction to be symmetric under the band permutation ( the constants in front of the interband @xmath60 and intraband @xmath61 terms are the same ) .",
    "if the mechanism of pairing is due to acoustic phonons only , such an additional term is not generated .",
    "a more general case with additional independent term was considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "usually such coupling with a positive coupling constant @xmath62 leads to the @xmath20-wave `` conventional '' pairing , while an `` unconventional '' @xmath31-wave pairing in @xmath63 or heavy fermion superconductors like @xmath33 requires subleading interaction terms with two derivatives ( most probably beyond electron - phonon mechanism ) .",
    "two qualitatively different cases will be considered , see fig.1 .",
    "when the chemical potential @xmath0 is much larger than the debye energy @xmath2 characterizing the outreach of the phonon - electron coupling , see fig.1a , the physics is similar to that considered for the parabolic bands within the bcs approximations @xcite . the opposite case , @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "1b ) is unusual and most of our findings are devoted to this case .",
    "the coulomb forces in eq.([ee ] ) in addition to direct repulsion lead to spin dependent forces due to exchange .",
    "the exchange interaction among itinerant electrons first considered by stoner @xcite , although small and unable to form a ferromagnetic state in materials under consideration , will be important for the nature of the condensate since it will lift the degeneracy between the singlet and the triplet pairing:@xmath64spin density in dirac semi - metal has the form @xmath65where the matrices @xmath66are also the rotation generators .",
    "since we consider the local interactions as dominant , the superconducting condensate ( the off - diagonal order parameter ) will be local@xmath67where the constant matrix @xmath57 should be a @xmath41 antisymmetric matrix . due to the rotation symmetry they transform covariantly under infinitesimal rotations generated by the spin @xmath68 operator , eq.([spindensity ] ) :    @xmath69   \\label{transformation } \\\\ & = & \\int_{r}\\psi _ { \\gamma } ^{+}\\left ( r\\right ) \\mathbf{\\sigma } _ { \\gamma \\delta } ^{i}\\left\\ { m_{\\delta \\kappa } ^{t}-m_{\\delta \\kappa } \\right\\ } \\psi _ { \\kappa } ^{+}\\left ( r\\right ) \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the representations of the rotation group therefore characterize various possible superconducting phases .",

    "a peculiarity of superconductivity in dirac semimetal at zero chemical potential is that electrons ( and holes ) in cooper pairs are created themselves by the pairing interaction rather than being present in the sample as free electrons .",
    "therefore it is shown that it is possible to neglect the effect of weak doping and consider directly the @xmath7 particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "this point in parameter space is the qcp sachdev .",
    "microscopically , cooper pairs of both electrons and holes are formed .",
    "the system is unique in this sense since the electron - hole symmetry is not spontaneously broken in both normal and superconducting phases .",
    "supercurrent in such a system does not carry momentum or mass .",

    "the dependence of the gap is @xmath169 for @xmath170 ( or @xmath171 ) .",

    "critical exponents coincide with the classical mean field 3d exponents .    in the strong coupling limit @xmath177 and @xmath178 . as we see in the next subsection ,",

    "the dirac superconductor therefore is a rare example of 3d quantum critical point .",
    "to summarize , we have constructed a microscopic theory of superconductivity ( at zero temperature ) in 3d time reversal and inversion invariant massless dirac  semi - metals . in these materials",
    "there are at least two bands of opposite chiralities .",

    "the `` conventional '' phonon mediated local attraction model we classified , under simplifying assumptions of the 3d rotation invariance , inversion and the time reversal , possible pairing channels .",
    "there are three singlet channels and one triplet .",
    "comparison of energies of these condensates for arbitrary chemical potential and the electron - electron interaction strength demonstrates that a singlet pairing always prevails , as shown in fig .",
    "however , one notices that in large portions of the phase diagram the energy density differences are much smaller that the typical values of energy densities themselves .",
    "this means that interactions that are small but discriminate between the spin singlet and the spin triplet are important in order to determine the nature of the superconducting order there .",
    "the best candidate for such an interaction in materials under consideration is the exchange ( the stoner term ) .",
    "parameters of the model are therefore the chemical potential @xmath0 , the effective electron - electron coupling strength @xmath62 and the stoner coupling exchange constant @xmath82 .",
    "our main results are given in figs .",
    "8a , 8b and 11 . in certain ranges of parameters that include the electron - phonon coupling parametrized by dimensional effective electron - electron coupling @xmath1 and the exchange interaction parametrized by @xmath4 , the triplet pairing is favored over the singlet one .",
    "8a , 8b demonstrate that the triplet exists either at small chemical potential of order debye energy @xmath2 or perhaps as small @xmath195 and large chemical potential , while the singlet prevails in the upper - right corner of the diagram beyond the red line .",
    "the second region where triplet is competitive happens to be beyond the range of validity of the perturbation theory and in fact will not materialize since the superconducting order instability is probably weaker than the stoner instability for ferromagnetic correlations , so we are left with the triplet states when the chemical potential is small .    to this end",
    "we have investigated the limit of zero chemical potential , where the tendency towards the triplet pairing should be maximal .",
    "this is presented in fig.11 . in this limit",
    "one can not use the dimensionless coupling strengths @xmath1 and @xmath4 , therefore should go back to the dimensional coupling strengths @xmath62 and @xmath196related to the former by eqs.([lambda],[lambdaex ] ) used in this phase diagram .",
    "transition to superconductivity in this case is a rare occurrence of quantum critical point in 3d with distinct critical couplings and exponents .",
    "[ [ experimental - feasibility - of - the - triplet - superconductivity - due - to - phonon - and - exchange - interactions . ] ] experimental feasibility of the triplet superconductivity due to phonon and exchange interactions . _  _ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    to estimate the pairing efficiency due to phonons , one should rely on recent studies @xcite .",
    "the effective dimensionless electron - electron coupling constant due to phonons @xmath197 defined in eq.([lambda ] ) , is obtained from the exchange of acoustic phonons and is of order@xcite @xmath198 ( somewhat lower values are obtained in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "note that a reasonable electron density of @xmath199 in @xmath200 already conforms to the requirement that chemical potential less than the debye cutoff energy @xmath201 .    to estimate the strength of the exchange interactions due to itinerant electrons one , as usual",
    ", starts from the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the effects of coulomb interaction in 3d dirac electrons are being studied extensivelywan .",
    "rg analysis reveals the logarithmic divergence of fermi velocity @xmath202 , while the effective fine structure constant @xmath203 is marginally irrelevant .",
    "when a dirac point is located on the fermi level , the coulomb interaction is not screened .",
    "the stoner theory@xcite predicts that when @xmath4 becomes of order @xmath136 , the material develops ferromagnetism .",
    "below that only the correlations play a role , but as is seen in figs.8a - b , such a relatively small exchange is sufficient to damage the singlet condensate in favor of the triplet .      in this paper we especially focused on the qualitatively distinct case of dirac fermions with small chemical potential",
    "the situation is quite similar to that of the 2d weyl semi - metal in topological insulators .",
    "although in the original proposal of ti in materials @xcite the chemical potential was zero , in experiments one finds often that the dirac point is shifted away from the fermi surface by a significant fraction of @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "there are however experimental methods to shift the location of the point by doping ( for example by copper@xcite ) , gating , pressure etc.@xcite .",
    "superconductivity was in fact observed in otherwise non - superconducting tis @xmath205 and @xmath17 under pressure@xcite @xmath206 ( for @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is possible that at a certain pressure the system passes through the quantum critical point and is therefore a candidate for the maximal enhancement of the triplet superconductivity .",
    "here we compare our results with the earlier work ref.@xcite designed to model the symmetries and parameters of cu doped @xmath17 .",
    "the case that can be directly compared is when the relativistic mass term ( denoted by @xmath207 in ref.@xcite ) is small compared to chemical potential . in this work",
    "a more general effective electron - electron interaction was considered with two couplings @xmath208 and @xmath209 for local intraband and interband attractions , respectively .",
    "they are related to our @xmath62 by @xmath210 .",
    "qualitatively , for @xmath211 one gets nearly degenerate energies ( critical temperatures were compared in ref.@xcite  instead ) .",
    "this is similar but not identical to our result without exchange , see fig .",
    "we indeed obtain the degeneracy of the two gaps , the singlet and the triplet ( their @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively ) , but only in the limit of large @xmath62 .",
    "the gaps are definitely not degenerate when the coupling @xmath62 is below @xmath214 .",
    "even within the bcs regime ( eqs.([bcs_s],[dt_bcs ] ) ) , @xmath215 .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath136 only for quite large coupling ( whatever uv cutoff used in ref .",
