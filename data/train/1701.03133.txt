    "<S> it was clear from the beginning that the scenarios of the ideal bose gas , well - known from thermodynamics , are not sufficient because of interactions between the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to liquid helium where interactions are strong  @xcite , ultracold vapours can be modelled nearly from first principles , the s - wave scattering length being the main relevant coupling constant . in lower spatial dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> interactions qualitatively change the phase diagram and lead to the emergence of a paired vortex phase ( kosterlitz  thouless transition , 2d ) or a quasi - condensate ( 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundaries are fuzzy , however , and the cross - over region , as it has been called , poses a challenge to conventional pictures . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , thermal and quantum fluctuations that are prominent anyway in lower dimensions have to be modelled in the presence of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> as the density is lowered through the cross - over region , density fluctuations become comparable to phase fluctuations , so that a luttinger liquid approach  @xcite breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> it is then questionable whether one can operate a clean splitting into a ` quasi - condensate ' and a ` thermal cloud ' familiar from spontaneous symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain why the cross - over is so difficult to describe with mean - field theories that build on the bogoliubov prescription .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we provide a critical assessment of mean - field theories for the description of the cross - over in a homogeneous one - dimensional bose gas between the ideal gas and the quasi - condensate . </S>",
    "<S> these approaches have the common feature that the many - body system is broken down to relevant collective observables that are treated as ` hydrodynamic fields ' , examples being the ( total ) density or a c - number valued condensate field . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic fields parametrise an approximate form of the many - body hamiltonian which is simple enough to be diagonalised in a quasi - particle basis with a well - defined dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> this permits to compute different mean values and correlation functions . throughout the paper , </S>",
    "<S> we exclude the case of strong interactions which leads to fermionisation ( impenetrable bosons , tonks - girardeau regime ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of variants for mean - field theories : some are based on perturbative expansions ( weak interactions , weak density fluctuations ) whose validity becomes doubtful in the cross - over region , others are constructed in a ` self - consistent ' way and may suggest a comprehensive treatment of both regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we give an overview on several approaches and work out in detail the equation of state , density fluctuations , and correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous approaches that have been implemented to improve on the simple mean - field theories . for a unified - notation review , </S>",
    "<S> the readers are referred to  refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the `` g1 '' variant of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation attempts to fix the issue of a gapless dispersion relation by carefully observing features a successful theory might have  indeed it had some success in modelling experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much has been written about a gapless spectrum in relation to the goldstone and hugenholtz - pines theorems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find here that its impact is marginal with respect to the performance of a mean - field theory in the cross - over of the one - dimensional bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we analyze two approximations , one gapless ( modified popov approximation of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , the other not ( hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory developed by walser and the holland group  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> their predictions for the equation of state and density fluctuations are qualitatively similar , however ( see figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : eqn - state - all4 ] , [ fig : g2-all4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> they also fail both in providing a smooth description as the chemical potential crosses zero , and predict a critical point ( discontinuity in the equation of state ) . </S>",
    "<S> this artefact has been noted before for mean - field theories in three dimensions , see refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a different fate arises when the self - consistent and gapless theory of yukalov and yukalova  @xcite is extrapolated to a one - dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals giving the non - condensate density and other quantities diverge in the infrared , similar to the simpler bogoliubov theory . in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this is claimed to be removed with dimensional regularization , effectively subtracting the divergent piece , although the resulting ` density ' becomes negative . </S>",
    "<S> an infrared regularization has also been operated in the modified popov theory , but following a different argument : the infrared - divergent pieces were identified as spurious phase fluctuations and eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expressions are discussed here .    </S>",
    "<S> another important development was the construction of an expansion for large particle numbers , but in a number - conserving way , following arguments laid out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and extended in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that for our system of interest , the homogeneous bose gas in the thermodynamic limit , the predictions of mean - field theory are qualitatively quite similar , whether it is formulated in a number - conserving way or in the grand - canonical ensemble with symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked this with the example of extended bogoliubov theory developed by mora and castin  @xcite : one key technique , the projector orthogonal to the condensate mode , is irrelevant for a homogeneous system where the elementary excitations naturally appear at finite momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the expansions behind these approaches , for example in the fraction of non - condensed particles , are bound to break down in the cross - over because there is no condensate in the dilute phase . in the case of extended bogoliubov theory , it is the assumption of weak density fluctuations that fails .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that none of the mean - field theories analyzed here describes the cross - over of the bose gas from dilute to dense in a satisfactory way : some theories are simply restricted ` by construction ' to either side of the phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> other theories give wrong predictions for one side , or suggest a critical point , e.g. , a discontinuity in the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , it is possible to follow the cross - over with the help of complex - field simulations ( stochastic gross - pitaevskii equation , sgp , for a review , see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> proposals of this technique date back to stoof s group  @xcite , davis and the burnett group  @xcite , and gardiner s group  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see also related classical field work by goral and the rzaewski group  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sgp has been applied to one - dimensional bose correlations by one of us  @xcite . with a suitably chosen cutoff , </S>",
    "<S> its predictions are in excellent agreement with experiments in one  @xcite and two dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these simulations successfully achieve a reasonable modelling of the entire cross - over . </S>",
    "<S> another ` benchmark ' is provided by the exact solution of the lieb - liniger model at finite temperature by yang and yang @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been used to cross - check perturbative calculations of density fluctuations in the dilute phase by kheruntsyan and the shlyapnikov group  @xcite .    to conclude with a comparison to experiments </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that many setups require modelling beyond the one - dimensional regime , mainly because the transverse confinement is not strong enough . as the ratio between trap frequencies is changed </S>",
    "<S> , one observes a `` dimensional cross - over '' from a true three - dimensional condensate to a one - dimensional quasi - condensate with large phase fluctuations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following relatively early anisotropic expansion experiments  @xcite , theoretical work on this has been performed by al khawaja et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and gerbier  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental work by the bouchoule group  @xcite demonstrated , for example , the breakdown of hartree - fock mean field theory by analyzing the density fluctuations , and mapped out the dimensional cross - over ( for a review , see ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> setups deeply in the one - dimensional regime have been reported in refs.@xcite where yang - yang thermodynamics could be checked . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of mean field theories becomes manifest experimentally in the boundary regions of a trapped system  @xcite . for the comparison with theory , the local density approximation ( lda ) is often applied . </S>",
    "<S> we check the accuracy of this approximation using sgp simulations for both a homogeneous system and a trapped one .    </S>",
