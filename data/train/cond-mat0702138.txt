    "studies on the emergence of collective and synchronized dynamics in large ensembles of coupled units have been carried out since the beginning of the nineties in different contexts and in a variety of fields , ranging from biology , ecology , and semiconductor lasers , to electronic circuits @xcite .",
    "collective synchronized dynamics has multiple applications in technology , and is a common framework to investigate the crucial features in the emergence of critical phenomena in natural systems . for instance , it is a relevant issue to fully understand some diseases that appear as the result of a sudden and undesirable synchronization of a large number of neuronal units @xcite .",
    "recently , synchronization phenomena have also been proved to be helpful outside the traditional fields where it applies , for instance , in sociology where it can be used to study the mechanisms leading to the formation of social collective behaviors @xcite .    among the many models that have been proposed to address synchronization phenomena ,",
    "one of the most successful attempts to understand them is due to kuramoto @xcite , who capitalized on previous works by winfree @xcite , and proposed a model system of nearly identical weakly coupled limit - cycle oscillators .",
    "the kuramoto ( km ) mean field case corresponding to a uniform , all - to - all and sinusoidal coupling is described by the equations of motion , @xmath0 where the factor @xmath1 is incorporated in order to ensure a good behavior of the model in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath2 , @xmath3 stands for the natural frequencies of the oscillators , and @xmath4 is the coupling constant .",
    "moreover , the coherence of the population of @xmath5 oscillators is measured by the complex order parameter , @xmath6 where the modulus @xmath7 measures the phase coherence of the population and @xmath8 is the average phase . in",
    "what follows , we will focus on the synchronization of coupled oscillators described by the dynamics eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramodel ] ) , because of its validity as an approximation for a large number of nonlinear equations and its ubiquity in the nonlinear literature @xcite .    the km approach to synchronization was a great breakthrough for the understanding of the emergence of synchronization in large populations of oscillators , in particular it presents a second - order phase transition from incoherence to synchronization , in the order parameter eq.([eq : kuraorderparam ] ) for a critical value of the coupling constant .",
    "however , a large amount of real systems do not show a homogeneous pattern of interconnections among their parts @xcite where the original km assumptions apply .",
    "many real natural @xcite , social @xcite and technological @xcite systems conform as networks of nodes with connectivity patterns that diverge considerably from homogeneity , and are usually characterized by a scale - free degree distribution , @xmath9 ( the degree @xmath10 is the number of connections of a node ) .",
    "the study of processes taking place on top of scale - free networks has led to reconsider classical results obtained for regular lattices or random graphs due to the radical changes of the system s dynamics when the heterogeneity of the connectivity patterns can not be neglected @xcite . in this case one has to deal with two sources of complexity , the nonlinear character of the dynamics and the complex structures of the substrate , which are usually entangled . a contemporary effort to attack this entangled problem was due to watts and strogatz , that in 1998 , trying to understand the synchronization of cricket chirps , which show a high degree of coordination over long distances as though the insects where  invisibly \" connected , end up with a seminal paper @xcite about the small - world connectivity property .",
    "this work was the seed of the modern theory of complex networks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the understanding of the synchronization dynamics in complex networks still remains a challenge .    in recent years",
    ", scientists have addressed the problem of synchronization on complex networks capitalizing on the master stability function ( msf ) formalism @xcite which allows to study the stability of the _ fully synchronized state _",
    "the msf is the result of a linear stability analysis for a completely synchronized system . while the msf approach is useful to get a first insight into what is going on in the system as far as the stability of the synchronized state is concerned , it tells nothing about how synchronization is attained and whether or not the system under study exhibits a transition similar to the original km . to this end",
    ", one must rely on numerical calculations and explore the _ entire phase diagram_. surprisingly , there are only a few works that have dealt with the study of the whole synchronization dynamics in specific scenarios @xcite as compared with those where the msf is used , given that the onset of synchronization is reacher in its behavioral repertoire than the state of complete synchronization .    in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have shown how , for fixed coupling strengths , local patterns of synchronization emerge differently in homogeneous and heterogeneous complex networks , driving the process towards a certain degree of global synchronization following different paths . in this paper , we extend the previous work to different topologies , even those with modular structure , and report more results supporting the previous claim .",
    "first , we extend the analysis carried out in @xcite to networks in which the degree of heterogeneity can be tuned between the two limits of random scale - free networks and random graphs with a poisson degree distribution .",
    "second , in order to get further insights about the role of the structural properties on the route towards complete synchronization , we study the same dynamics on top of networks with a non - random structure at the mesoscopic level , i.e. , networks with communities .",
    "the results support the usefulness of the tools developed and highlight the relevance of synchronization phenomena to study in detail the relationship between structure and function in complex networks .",
    "let us now focus on the paradigmatic kuramoto model . in order to manage with the km on top of complex topologies we reformulate eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramodel ] ) to the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coupling strength between pairs of connected oscillators and @xmath13 is the connectivity matrix ( @xmath14 if @xmath15 is linked to @xmath16 and @xmath17 otherwise ) . the original kuramoto model introduced above assumed mean - field interactions so that @xmath18 ( all - to - all ) and @xmath19 .",
    "the first problem when dealing with the km in complex networks is the definition of the dynamics . in the seminal paper by kuramoto @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramodel ] ) , the coupling term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ks ] ) is an intensive magnitude .",
    "the dependence on the number of oscillators @xmath5 is avoided by choosing @xmath20 .",
    "this prescription turns out to be essential for the analysis of the system in the thermodynamic limit @xmath21 .",
    "however , choosing @xmath20 the dynamics of the km in a complex network becomes dependent on @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit , the coupling term tends to zero except for those nodes with a degree that scales with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a second prescription consists of taking @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the degree of node @xmath15 ) so that @xmath12 is a weighted interaction factor that also makes intensive the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ks ] ) .",
    "this form has been used to solve the so - called _ paradox of heterogeneity _ that states that the heterogeneity in the degree distribution , which often reduces the average distance between nodes , may suppress synchronization in networks of oscillators coupled symmetrically with uniform coupling strength @xcite .",
    "one should consider this result carefully because it refers to the stability of the _ fully synchronized state _",
    "( see below ) not to the _ whole evolution _ of synchronization in the network .",
    "more important , the inclusion of weights in the interaction strongly affects the original km dynamics in complex networks because it imposes a dynamic homogeneity that could mask the real topological heterogeneity of the network .",
    "finally , the prescription @xmath24 @xcite , which may seem more appropriate , also presents some conceptual problems because the sum in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ks ] ) could eventually diverge in the thermodynamic limit if synchronization is achieved .",
    "to our understanding , the most accurate interpretation of the km dynamics in complex networks should preserve the essential fact of treating the heterogeneity of the network independently of the interaction dynamics , and at the same time , should remain calculable in the thermodynamic limit . taking into account these factors ,",
    "the interaction @xmath12 in complex networks should be inversely proportional to the largest degree of the system @xmath25 keeping in this way the original formulation of the km valid in the thermodynamic limit ( in sf networks @xmath26 ) .",
    "in addition , the same order parameter , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuraorderparam ] ) , can be used to describe the coherence of the synchronized state .",
    "since @xmath27 is constant for a given network , the physical meaning of this prescription is a re - scaling of the time units involved in the dynamics .",
    "note , however , that for a proper comparison of the synchronizability of different complex networks , the global and local measures of coherence should be represented according to their respective time scales .",
    "therefore , given two complex networks a and b with @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , the comparison between observable must be done for the same effective coupling @xmath30 . with this formulation in mind",
    "( [ ks ] ) reduces to @xmath31 independently of the specific topology of the network .",
    "this allow us to study the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kscn ] ) over different topologies in order to compare the results and properly inspect the interplay between topology and dynamics in what concerns to synchronization .",
    "recent results have shed light on the influence of the local interactions topology on the route to synchronization @xcite . however , in these studies at least two parameters ( clustering and average path length ) vary along the studied family of networks . this paired evolution ,",
    "although yielding an interesting interplay between the two topological parameters , makes it difficult to distinguish what effects were due to one or other factors . here , we would like to address first what is the influence of heterogeneity , keeping the number of degrees of freedom to a minimum for the comparison to be meaningful .",
    "the family of networks used in the present section are comparable in their clustering , average distance and correlations so that the only difference relies on the degree distribution , ranging from a poissonian type to a scale - free distribution . later on in this paper",
    ", we will relax these constraints and study networks in which the main topological feature is given at the mesoscopic scale , i.e. , networks with community structure .",
    "therefore , let us first scrutinize and compare the synchronization patterns in erds - rnyi ( er ) and scale - free ( sf ) networks .",
    "for this purpose we make use of the model proposed in @xcite that allows a smooth interpolation between these two extremal topologies . besides , we introduce a new parameter to characterize the synchronization paths to unravel their differences .",
    "the results reveal that the synchronizability of these networks does depend on the coupling between units , and hence , that general statements about their synchronizability are eventually misleading .",
    "moreover , we show that even in the incoherent solution , @xmath32 , the system is self - organizing towards synchronization",
    ". we will analyze in detail how this self - organization is attained .",
    "the first numerical study about the onset of synchronization of kuramoto oscillators in sf networks @xcite revealed the great propense of sf networks to synchronization , which is revealed by a non - zero but very small critical value @xmath33 @xcite . besides",
    ", it was observed that at the synchronized state , @xmath34 , hubs are extremely robust to perturbations since the recovery time of a node as a function of its degree follows a power law with exponent @xmath35 .",
    "however , how do sf networks compare with homogeneous networks and what are the roots of the different behaviors observed ?",
    "we first concentrate on global synchronization for the kuramoto model eq .",
    "( [ eq : kscn ] ) . for this",
    "we follow the evolution of the order parameter @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuraorderparam ] ) , as @xmath37 increases , to capture the global coherence of the synchronization in networks",
    ". we will perform this analysis on the family of networks generated with the model introduced in @xcite .",
    "this model generates a one - parameter family of networks labeled by @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 measures the degree of heterogeneity of the final networks so that @xmath40 corresponds to the heterogeneous ba network and @xmath41 to homogeneous er graphs . for intermediate values of @xmath39 one obtains networks that have been grown combining both preferential attachment and homogeneous random linking so that each mechanism is chosen with probabilities @xmath42 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "it is worth stressing that the growth mechanism preserves the total number of links , @xmath43 , and nodes , @xmath5 , for a proper comparison between different values of @xmath39 .",
    "specifically , assuming the final size of the network to be @xmath5 , the network is build up starting from a fully connected core of @xmath44 nodes and a set @xmath45 of @xmath46 unconnected nodes . then",
    ", at each time step , a new node ( not selected before ) is chosen from @xmath47 and linked to @xmath48 other nodes .",
    "each of the @xmath48 links is attached with probability @xmath39 to a randomly chosen node ( avoiding self- connections ) from the whole set of @xmath49 remaining nodes and with probability @xmath42 following a linear preferential attachment strategy @xcite . after repeating this process @xmath46 times ,",
    "networks interpolating between the limiting cases of er ( @xmath41 ) and sf ( @xmath40 ) topologies are generated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with this procedure , the degree of heterogeneity of the grown networks varies smoothly between the two limiting cases .",
    "the curves @xmath50 for several network topologies ranging from er to sf are shown in fig.[10000r ] . we have performed extensive numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kscn ] ) for each network substrate starting from @xmath51 and increasing it up to @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "a large number ( at least @xmath54 ) of different network realizations and initial conditions were considered for every value of @xmath37 in order to obtain an accurate phase diagram .",
    "the natural frequencies @xmath3 and the initial values of @xmath55 were randomly drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "fig.[10000r ] reveals the differences in the critical behavior as a function of the substrate heterogeneity .",
    "the global coherence of the synchronized state , represented by @xmath36 , shows that the onset of synchronization first occurs for sf networks .",
    "as the network substrate becomes more homogeneous the critical point @xmath33 shifts to larger values and the system seems to be less synchronizable .",
    "on the other hand , it is also clear that the route to complete synchronization , @xmath34 , is faster for homogeneous networks .",
    "that is , when @xmath58 the growth rate of @xmath36 increases with @xmath39 . to inspect in depth the critical parameters of the system dynamics",
    "we perform a finite size scaling analysis .",
    "this allows to determine with precision the curve @xmath59 and study the critical behavior near the synchronization transition .",
    "we assume a scaling relation of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is as usual a universal scaling function bounded as @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are critical exponents to be determined .",
    "the detailed analysis performed for both sf and er topologies shows that the critical value of the effective coupling , @xmath33 , corresponds in scale - free networks to @xmath65 , and in random networks to @xmath66 , accordingly with fig.[10000r ] . in both cases",
    ", the transition strongly recalls the classical transition of the original km @xcite with a critical exponent near @xmath67 for the sf network @xcite . for intermediate values of @xmath39 ,",
    "the results show that the critical point shifts to larger values as the degree of heterogeneity increases . they are shown in table[table1 ] together with some topological properties of the networks .",
    ".[table1 ] topological properties of the networks used in this work and critical points for the onset of synchronization obtained from a fss analysis ( eq .  ( [ eqfss ] ) ) .",
    "the topological quantities reported are the result of an average over 1000 network realizations . @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath69 have been set for all networks .",

    "the original work by kuramoto pointed out that at the onset of synchronization small clusters of locked oscillators emerge and that the recruitment of more oscillators into these clusters as the coupling is increased makes it larger the global coherence @xmath36 of the system .",
    "obviously the emergence of these clusters would depend on the underlying topology which drives the possible configurations that locked oscillators would eventually form . to see how this initial coherence is achieved we propose a new order parameter , @xmath71 .",
    "this parameter measures the local construction of the synchronization patterns @xcite and allows for the exploration of how global synchronization is attained .",

    "the parameter @xmath71 measures the fraction of all possible links that are synchronized in the network .",
    "the averaging time @xmath74 should be taken large enough in order to obtain good measures of the degree of coherence between each pair of physically connected nodes .",
    "besides , @xmath71 is computed after the system relaxes at some large time @xmath75 .",
    "note that in the limit of all - to - all coupling the information provided by @xmath71 is exactly the same that the one provided by @xmath36 because in this case @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , no additional information would be provided by this new parameter in the all - to - all case . here , however , it turns out to be the key parameter to characterize how synchronization emerges at a local scale .    in fig.[r ]",
    "we represent the evolution of both order parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath71 , as a function of the coupling strength @xmath37 for several values of @xmath39 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath71 shows a change in synchronizability between er and sf and provides additional information to that reported by @xmath36 .",
    "interestingly , the nonzero values of @xmath71 for @xmath77 indicate the existence of some local synchronization patterns even in the regime of global incoherence ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "right at the onset of synchronization for the sf network limit , its @xmath71 value deviates from that of the er recovering the known result about the synchronization of sf networks for lower values of the coupling . in this region , while the synchronization patterns continue to grow for the er network at the same rate , the formation of locally synchronized structures occurs at a faster rate in the sf network . finally , when the incoherent solution in the er network destabilizes , the growing in its synchronization pattern increases drastically up to values of @xmath71 comparable to those obtained in sf networks and even higher .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath39 , the results show that the effect of varying the heterogeneity of the underlying network is twofold .",
    "on one hand , the more heterogeneous the network is , the smaller the values of @xmath37 needed for the onset of synchronization .",
    "conversely , the increase in the degree of heterogeneity results in larger values of @xmath37 in order to achieve complete synchronization . in short , as the heterogeneity is increased , the onset of synchronization is anticipated , but at the same time , the appearance of the fully synchronized state is delayed .",
    "these results undoubtedly point out that statements about synchronizability are dependent on the coupling strength value . to shed new light on this phenomenon , we have studied the characteristics of the synchronization patterns along the evolution of @xmath71 . following the usual picture ,",
    "synchronization patterns are formed by pairs of oscillators , physically connected , whose phase difference in the stationary state tends to zero . in order to determine which pairs of nodes",
    "are truly synchronized we should determine the coherence of their dynamics .",
    "note that eq.([r_link ] ) is the average dynamical coherence between every pair of linked nodes and then the synchronization degree of every pair of connected oscillators can be written in terms of a symmetric matrix @xmath79}dt\\right    |\\;. \\label{eq : dij}\\ ] ] then one has to analyze each matrix term @xmath80 in order to label a link @xmath81 as synchronized or not . as introduced above , from the computation of @xmath71 one",
    "determines the fraction of physical links that are synchronized so that one would expect that @xmath82 elements of the matrix @xmath83 are @xmath84 , while the remaining elements are @xmath85 .",
    "however , this is not the real situation since the network dynamics is not well defined in terms of a fully synchronized cluster and a set of completely incoherent oscillators . on the other hand",
    ", the worst scenario would be found if there were @xmath86 elements of matrix @xmath87 so that @xmath88 , implying that all the physically connected pairs are equally synchronized and hence the parameter @xmath71 could not be interpreted as the fraction of links that are dynamically coherent and no information about the topological patterns of synchronization could be extracted from matrix @xmath83 .",
    "the situation found is not as simple as the former possibility and not so dramatic as the latter .",
    "the contributions @xmath80 of the @xmath43 elements of matrix @xmath83 that correspond to physical links can be ordered from the highest to the lowest one .",
    "we have checked that for two situations , corresponding to the onset of synchronization ( @xmath89 ) and when high global coherence ( @xmath90 ) is observed for a sf network , synchronized links can be clearly identified . for the onset of synchronization",
    ", a subset of nearly @xmath91 of links displaying coherent dynamics with high degree of synchronization , @xmath92 , is well separated from the behavior of the remaining links as a dramatic decrease of @xmath80 takes place . in this sense , it is clear that the dynamics of a @xmath93 of the possible pairs can be regarded as synchronized which is in agreement with the obtained value @xmath94 for @xmath89 and support that although macroscopic coherence is not observed ( @xmath95 at this point ) the system is seen to walk towards it . for @xmath90 ( @xmath96 ) a plateau of nearly @xmath97 of links",
    "is observed , thus revealing the high degree of global coherence , @xmath98 , at this point .",
    "therefore , the shape of the ranked @xmath99 curves confirm that @xmath71 gives the fraction of synchronized links and thus the latter allows to obtain information about synchronized patterns from @xmath83 .    to determine exactly which pairs of nodes are regarded as synchronized , the matrix @xmath100 is filtered using a threshold @xmath101 such that the fraction of synchronized pairs equals @xmath71 . in this way",
    "@xmath101 is a moving threshold so that if @xmath102 oscillators @xmath15 and @xmath16 are considered synchronized .",
    "the value of @xmath101 depends on the particular realization and is determined by means of an iterative scheme starting from @xmath103 . decreasing it with @xmath104 one",
    "computes the amount of links that fulfills the condition . in this way , the value of @xmath101 progressively decreases and more pairs of oscillators are chosen .",
    "the process lasts until @xmath101 is such that the fraction of chosen links is equal to the desired value @xmath71 previously computed from @xmath100 .",
    "finally , when the synchronized links are identified the clusters of synchronized nodes are reconstructed .",
    "figure [ pattern ] represents the number of synchronized clusters and the size of the giant component ( @xmath105 ) as a function of @xmath71 for the same values of @xmath39 used in fig .",
    "the local information extracted from it points to a novel feature of the synchronization process that is not possible to derive from figs.[10000r ] and [ r ] , and that is unexpected .",
    "the emergence of clusters of synchronized pairs of oscillators ( links ) in the networks shows that for values of @xmath37 for which the incoherent solution @xmath32 is stable , the networks have developed a largest cluster of synchronized pairs of oscillators involving @xmath106 of the nodes , and an equal number of smaller synchronization clusters . from this point on , the behavior of both @xmath105 and @xmath107 depends on the specific value of @xmath39 .",
    "when heterogeneity dominates , the gc grows and the number of smaller clusters goes down , whereas for less heterogeneous networks the growth of @xmath105 is more abrupt and nodes are incorporated to it more faster .",
    "moreover , the results highlight the fact that although heterogeneous networks exhibit more coherence in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath71 , the microscopic evolution of the synchronization patterns is faster in homogeneous networks , being these networks far more locally synchronizable than the heterogeneous ones once @xmath108 .",
    "the observed differences in the behavior at a local scale are rooted in the growth of the @xmath105 .",
    "for homogeneous topologies , many small clusters of synchronized pairs of oscillators ( note in fig.[pattern ] the large number of clusters formed when a @xmath109 of the links are synchronized ) merge together to form a gc when the effective coupling is increased .",
    "this coalescence of many small clusters results in a giant component made up of almost the size of the system once the incoherent state destabilizes .",
    "on the other hand , for heterogeneous graphs , the growth of the giant component is more smooth and the oscillators form new pairs starting from a core made up of half the nodes of the network .",
    "that is , in one case ( er - like networks ) , almost all the nodes of the network takes part of the giant component from the beginning and latter on , when @xmath37 is increased , what is added to the @xmath105 are the links among these nodes that were missing in the original cluster of synchronized nodes .",
    "for sf - like networks , the mechanism is the opposite .",
    "nodes are added to the @xmath105 _ together _ with most of their links , resulting in a growth of @xmath71 much slower than for the homogeneous topologies .    the above picture is confirmed in fig.[nets ] , where we have represented the evolution of the local synchronization patterns of the giant components in er and sf networks for several values of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath110 the two networks follow different paths toward synchronization . in particular ,",
    "the giant component for the sf network seems to retain the topological features of the substrate network , while this is not the case for the er network ( for instance , the small - world property is clearly lacking ) .",
    "this study about the patterns of self - organization towards synchronization reveals that the quantitative difference about the macroscopic behavior , shown by the computation of the evolution of the global coherence @xmath36 for er and sf networks , has its roots on a qualitatively different route at the microscopic level of description . the use of the new parameter @xmath71 which involves the computation of the degree of coherence between each pair of linked nodes is a useful tool for describing such differences .",
    "moreover , the results suggest that the degree of heterogeneity of the network is the key ingredient to explain the two different routes observed .",
    "the technique developed to extract the synchronization patterns allows the analysis of the topological features of such clusters of nodes .",
    "we can compute the average measures of relevant quantities such as the clustering coefficient or the degree distribution , and see how these magnitudes evolve from the uncoupled limit , where no synchronization occurs , to the coherent regime where the synchronized network coincides with the underlying substrate .",
    "it is then relevant to explore the regions where the onset of synchronization takes place and characterize topologically these emergent synchronized clusters .    in fig.[clust ]",
    "the evolution of the average clustering coefficient @xmath111 of the giant synchronized cluster referred to @xmath112 in the underlying network , is plotted as a function of @xmath37 for both the ba and er networks .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the results depicted in the figure have been computed taking into account that nodes with degree 1 does not contribute to the clustering coefficient of the @xmath105 , as @xmath113 is not properly defined for these nodes .",
    "the results are illustrative of the local organization of synchronized nodes .",
    "the figure shows that for both topologies the clustering decreases as the coupling is increased beyond their respective @xmath33 or , in other words , as the giant component grows by the addition of new synchronized pairs of nodes .",
    "however , the effects of the two different routes to complete synchronization observed for er and sf networks are well appreciated from the results . for the heterogeneous network",
    "there is a smooth decrease of the clustering coefficient for @xmath114 and the effects of the emergence of global coherence are not dramatic in what refers to the behavior of @xmath111 .",
    "this is because in this case the giant component mainly grows by recruiting new synchronized nodes and their links . on the other hand , for the er graph the behavior observed for @xmath115 , i.e. when",
    "no macroscopic coherence is observed , is interrupted by a sudden jump near its critical value .",
    "in fact , for @xmath116 the clustering of the synchronized cluster quickly approaches the value of @xmath117 of the substrate network .",
    "this effect becomes clear if one has in mind the coalescence of small clusters , which happens around the critical point for er graphs .",
    "in fact , taking into account the giant synchronized component on er for @xmath115 , implies to consider one of the several disjoint synchronized clusters of similar sizes that are in this region .",
    "moreover , the coalescence process leads to the formation of a giant cluster that contains almost all the nodes of the network ( see fig .  [ pattern ] ) , but a number of links significantly smaller .",
    "hence , when the clusters collapse into a much larger one , the topological features change dramatically as observed from the evolution of the clustering coefficient .",
    "all the results reported above point out that the ultimate reason behind the two different routes to complete synchronization is the heterogeneous character of the sf network and the role played by the hubs . the natural cohesion that hubs provide to sf network prevents the existence of independent macroscopic clusters of synchrony as occurs for er networks .",
    "it is then interesting to study how these hubs participate in the formation of the final synchronized state . for this",
    ", we first study the evolution with @xmath37 of the composition of the synchronized cluster in terms of the degree of its components . in @xcite , we reported the probability that a node with degree @xmath10 belongs to the giant synchronized cluster as a function of its degree @xmath10 and the coupling @xmath37 for the sf network .",
    "this probability turns out to be an increasing function of @xmath10 for every value of @xmath37 and therefore the more connected a node is , the more likely it takes part in the cluster of synchronized links .",
    "in particular , the results confirm the hypothesis made above that the hubs participate from the very beginning on the formation of the synchronized cluster .",
    "a similar result was obtained in @xcite , where zhou and kurths studied the hierarchical organization in complex networks , using the msf and a mean - field approach in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the above characterization of the synchronized cluster in terms of the degree of its component can be completed studying their effective degree , @xmath118 .",
    "the effective degree of a synchronized node is the number of links it shares with other nodes belonging to the same synchronized cluster .",
    "obviously , at the complete synchronized regime a node with degree @xmath10 will have @xmath119 .",
    "we have plotted in fig.[ki ] the quantity @xmath120 ( the fraction of links that a node has with synchronized neighbors ) as a function of @xmath37 and the degree @xmath10 of the nodes ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the results reveal that although hubs are the first to take part of the synchronized cluster , their neighbors are progressively incorporated to the cluster as @xmath37 grows . besides , if a node with small @xmath10 is synchronized the probability that its neighbors are also synchronized grows very fast with @xmath37 which is an effect of the network topology .",
    "these results further support the statement about the essential role played by the hubs in the recruitment of oscillators into the synchronized group and in the emergence of complete synchronization in sf networks .",
    "in light of the results of the above section we have extended the study beyond unstructured networks to structured or modular networks .",
    "this is a limiting situation in which the local structure may greatly affect the dynamics , irrespective of whether or not we deal with homogeneous or heterogeneous networks and then they constitute a perfect framework for testing the new order parameter @xmath71 introduced in the last section .",
    "many complex networks in nature are modular , i.e. composed of certain subgraphs with differentiated internal and external connectivity that form communities @xcite .",
    "the use of modular networks where a proper comparison in synchronizability can be performed ( same number of nodes and links ) restricts us to the consideration of synthetic structured networks . to this end",
    ", we make use of a common benchmark of random network with community structure , first proposed by newman @xcite considering one hierarchical level and later extended to several hierarchical levels @xcite .",
    "the modular network structure we build is as follows : in a set of @xmath5 nodes , we prescribe @xmath121 compartments that will represent our first community organizational level , and @xmath48 compartments , each one embedding four different compartments of the first level , that define the second organizational level of the network . the internal degree of nodes at the first level @xmath122 and the internal degree of nodes at the second level @xmath123 keep an average degree @xmath124 so that these networks are strictly homogeneous in the sense of the degree distribution , @xmath125 . networks with two hierarchical levels are labeled as @xmath122 - @xmath123 , e.g. a network with @xmath15-@xmath16 means @xmath15 links with the nodes of its first hierarchical community level ( more internal ) , @xmath16 links with the rest of communities that form the second hierarchical level ( more external ) and @xmath126 links with any community of the rest of the network .",
    "synchronization processes on top of modular networks of this type have been recently studied as a mechanism for community detection @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the situation in which starting from a set of homogeneous ( in terms of the natural frequencies ) kuramoto oscillators with different initial conditions the system evolves after a transient of time to the synchronized state .",
    "it was shown that the community structure is progressively unveiled at the same time the system s dynamics evolves toward the coherent state and the synchronization is attained .",
    "in particular , the nodes belonging to the first community level are the first to get synchronized , subsequently the second level nodes achieve the frequency entrainment and finally the whole system shows global synchronization .",
    "here we adopt a different perspective since we will consider as previously a set of non - identical kuramoto oscillators with random assignment of natural frequencies and hence the final degree of system s synchronization will depend on the strength of the coupling .",
    "it is then interesting to study how the degree of synchronization evolves as a function of @xmath37 and whether the coherence between nodes is progressively distributed following the hierarchy imposed by the underlying topology . for this , we make use of the order parameters @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuraorderparam ] ) , and @xmath71 , eq ( [ r_link ] ) , to characterize the synchronization transition on two slightly different modular networks with two well defined hierarchical levels , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , being this difference the cohesion of the internal community core , 13 links out of 15 possible neighbors or 15 links ( i.e. , all - to - all ) at the most internal level . both networks have @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "fig.[communities ] shows the results for both kinds of networks revealing that the path towards synchronization as a function of the interaction is again affected by the structure .",
    "they also show that the information provided by @xmath71 is essential to unveil the synchronization process .",
    "while the global synchronization parameter @xmath36 is reflecting that the @xmath127 structure globally synchronizes always better , @xmath71 tells us again about the local synchronization .",
    "it shows that local synchronization is indeed favored in the @xmath128 structure since @xmath71 is larger for this topology for small values of @xmath37 where the system is locally forming synchronized clusters .",
    "this result , not captured by the macroscopic indicator @xmath36 , is expected since the internal cohesion of communities at the first hierarchical level is larger for the 15 - 2 than for the 13 - 4 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath71 shows that when the coupling @xmath37 is increased the number of links synchronized in the @xmath127 network becomes larger than in the @xmath128 structure revealing that complete synchronization is then favored by the presence of more external links connecting the first level communities .",
    "fig.[gc_comm ] shows the size of the giant component of synchronized clusters and the number of them as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "an interesting effect of the community structure of the networks and of the dynamics of the synchronization process is revealed in the figure .",
    "right at the value of @xmath37 where the onset of global coherence takes place , the size of @xmath105 suddenly falls to increase again at larger values of the coupling strength .",
    "additionally , note that this point coincides with that corresponding to a change in the concavity of the @xmath131 curves .",
    "this change at the microscopic level is due to the readjustment of links that connect synchronized nodes .",
    "in fact , as fig .",
    "[ nlinks ] illustrates for both networks , in this region of @xmath37 values , the number of links connecting synchronized nodes of the third level decreases while the number of those ascribed to the second level raises .",
    "that is , the synchronization process takes place in such a way that the first to synchronize are the nodes of the inner community level , then the second and so on until the whole network gets synchronized .",
    "the relevant fact is that in order for @xmath71 and @xmath36 to grow , the nodes and links of the second level adjust their phases at the expense of those of the outer layer , the third level .",
    "this is also reflected in the number of clusters of synchronized links ( @xmath107 ) , i.e. , the network appears like if the nodes of the third level were `` temporarily '' disconnected .",
    "moreover , as the @xmath127 network has more links connecting the first and the second hierarchical levels , @xmath132 raises faster in this network than in the @xmath128 .",
    "we have further inspected the synchronization path in modular networks . this can be easily done and visualized by the representation of the filtered matrix @xmath100 .",
    "it implies to reassign the values of matrix @xmath100 so that @xmath133 if @xmath102 , and @xmath134 otherwise . plotting this filtered matrix for different values of the coupling @xmath37 one",
    "can easily determine which links are the first to synchronize since the form of the adjacency matrix ( that includes all the physical links between nodes ) is also easy to interpret because of its nested structure .",
    "fig.[13 - 4 ] shows how the community structure determines the internal organization of the system in the route towards full synchronization for the @xmath127 network . for this study",
    "we have computed the value of the filtered matrix @xmath100 for a number of initial conditions and then took its average value so that @xmath135 $ ] accounts for the synchronization strength of the network link @xmath81 .",
    "the results point out that link synchronization depends on the organizational level they belong to .",
    "those connecting nodes belonging to the same first level community are the fastest ( in terms of the coupling strength @xmath37 ) to reach full synchronization . for larger values of @xmath37 full synchronization",
    "is attained progressively for the subsequent organizational levels .",
    "then , one can conclude that the inner the link is the faster it gets synchronized in agreement with previous studies reported above @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have explored several issues about synchronization in complex networks of kuramoto phase oscillators .",
    "our main concern has been the study of the synchronization patterns that emerge as the coupling between non - identical oscillators increases .",
    "we have described the degree of synchronization between each pair of connected oscillators .",
    "the use of a new parameter , @xmath71 , allows to reconstruct the synchronization clusters from the dynamical data .",
    "we have studied how the underlying topology ( ranging from homogeneous to heterogeneous structures ) affects the evolution of synchronization patterns .",
    "the results reveal that the route towards full synchronization depends strongly on whether one deals with homogeneous or heterogenous topologies .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that a giant cluster of synchronization in heterogeneous networks comes out from a unique core formed by highly connected nodes ( hubs ) whereas for homogeneous networks several synchronization clusters of similar size can coexist . in the latter case , a coalescence of these clusters",
    "is observed in the synchronization path which is macroscopically manifested by the sudden growth of global coherence . another important effect of the underlying topology is manifested in an anticipated onset of global coherence for heterogeneous networks with respect to more homogeneous topologies .",
    "however , the latter reaches the state of full synchronization at lower values of the coupling strength , therefore showing that statements about synchronizability of complex networks are relative to the region of the phase diagram where they operate .",
    "additionally , we have shown that these systems are seen to organize towards synchronization even when no macroscopic signs of global coherence is observed .",
    "finally , the framework of structured networks has provided a useful benchmark for testing the validity of the new parameter @xmath71 and the information obtained from the computation of matrix @xmath136 .",
    "the results obtained by means of these quantities allow to conclude that for modular networks synchronization is first locally attained at the most internal level of organization and , as the coupling is increased , it progressively evolves toward outer shells of the network .",
    "the latter process is however achieved at the expense of partially readjusting some pairs of synchronized nodes between the inner and outer community levels . besides",
    ", we have obtained evidences that a high cohesion at the first level communities produce a high degree of local synchronization although it delays the appearance of the global coherent state .",
    "this study has extended the previous findings about the paths towards synchronization in complex networks @xcite , and provides a deeper understanding of phase synchronization phenomena on top of complex topologies . in general",
    ", the work supports the idea that in the absence of analytical tools to confront the resolution of non - linear dynamical models in complex networks , the introduction of new parameters to describe the statistical properties of the emergence of local patterns is needed as they give novel and useful information that might guide our comprehension of these phenomena . on more general grounds , this work adds to other recent findings @xcite about the topology emerging from dynamical processes .",
    "the evidences that are being accumulated point to a dynamical organization , both at the local and global scales , that is driven by the underlying topology .",
    "whether or not this intriguing regularity has something to do with the ubiquity of complex heterogeneous networks in nature is not clear yet .",
    "more works in this direction are needed , but we think that they may ultimately lead to uncover important universal relations between the structure and function of complex natural systems that form networks . another issue to explore in future works concerns the behavior of non - linear dynamical systems on top of directed networks @xcite , which will allow deeper insights into the behavior of natural systems .",
