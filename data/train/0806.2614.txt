    "pion compton scattering , @xmath10 , allows one to extract the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the ( charged ) pion . in a classical picture",
    "these polarizabilities characterize the deformation response ( i.e. induced dipole moments ) of a composite system in external electric and magnetic fields . in the proper quantum field",
    "theoretical formulation the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are defined as expansion coefficients of the compton scattering amplitudes at threshold . however , since pion targets are not directly available , real pion compton scattering has been approached using different artifices , such as high - energy pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung @xmath13 , radiative pion photoproduction off the proton @xmath14 , and the crossed channel two - photon reaction @xmath15 .    from the theoretical side",
    "there is an extraordinary interest in a precise ( experimental ) determination of the pion polarizabilities . within the framework of current algebra",
    "@xcite it has been shown ( long ago ) that the polarizability difference @xmath16 of the charged pion is directly related to the axial - vector - to - vector form factor ratio @xmath17 measured in the radiative pion decay @xmath18 @xcite . at leading ( nontrivial ) order the result of chiral perturbation theory @xcite , @xmath19 ,",
    "is of course the same after identifying the combination of low - energy constants as @xmath20 .",
    "recently , the systematic corrections to this current algebra result have been worked out in refs.@xcite by performing a full two - loop calculation of pion compton scattering in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the outcome of that extensive analysis is that altogether the higher order corrections are rather small and the value @xmath21@xmath9",
    "@xcite for the pion polarizability difference stands now as a firm prediction of the ( chiral - invariant ) theory .",
    "the non - vanishing value @xmath22@xmath9 for the pion polarizability sum ( obtained also at two - loop order ) is presumably too small to cause an observable effect in low - energy pion compton scattering .",
    "however , the chiral prediction @xmath23@xmath9 is in conflict with the existing experimental determinations of @xmath24@xmath9 from serpukhov @xcite and @xmath25@xmath9 from mainz @xcite , which amount to values more than twice as large .",
    "these existing experimental determinations of @xmath16 certainly raise doubt as to their correctness since they violate the chiral low - energy theorem notably by a factor 2 . in",
    "that contradictory situation it is promising that the ongoing compass @xcite experiment at cern aims at measuring the pion polarizabilities with high statistics using the primakoff effect .",
    "the scattering of high - energy negative pions in the coulomb field of a heavy nucleus gives ( in the region of sufficiently small photon virtualities ) access to cross sections for @xmath26 reactions .",
    "as an alternative , one could also directly analyze the bremsstrahlung process @xmath27 , omitting the whole kinematical extrapolation from virtual to real photons . in the appendix",
    "we will write down the corresponding fivefold differential cross section @xmath28 including born terms , the pion polarizability difference @xmath16 , and an ( equally ) important pion - loop correction .    in any case , the effects of the pion s low - energy structure on ( real or virtual ) compton scattering observables turn out to be relatively small . for center - of - mass energies @xmath29 ( i.e. sufficiently below the prominent @xmath30-resonance ) the differential cross sections @xmath31 in backward directions are reduced at most by about @xmath32 in comparison to the ones of a structureless pion @xcite .",
    "therefore , a precise knowledge of the pure qed radiative corrections to pion compton scattering is indispensable if one wants to extract the pion polarizabilities from the data with good accuracy . in certain kinematical regions",
    "the effects from the pion s low - energy structure and the pure qed radiative corrections may become of comparable size .",
    "although calculations of radiative corrections are abundant in the literature , we are not aware of a detailed and utilizable exposition of the radiative corrections to scalar ( spin-0 ) boson compton scattering .",
    "the case of spin-1/2 electron compton scattering has been treated already in the early days of quantum electrodynamics by brown and feynman @xcite .",
    "the radiative corrections to the thomson limit , valid close to threshold , have been reported in ref.@xcite . in the work of akhundov et al .",
    "@xcite the one - photon loop diagrams to virtual pion compton scattering have been considered , but no accessible sources to the corresponding analytical expressions ( which are necessary for an implementation into data analyses ) are given .",
    "since those previous results were mainly presented in numerical form it is difficult to implement them independently into future data analyses . as a consequence of that deficit the radiative corrections to pion compton scattering are",
    "sometimes merely adapted from the known ones for myons by simply replacing the mass : @xmath33 .",
    "of course , such a substitutional procedure mistreats profound differences in the couplings of photons to scalar spin-0 bosons and spin-1/2 fermions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap and to present a detailed calculation of the one - photon loop radiative corrections to pion compton scattering , @xmath34 . we give closed - form analytical expressions for the @xmath1 corrections to the two invariant amplitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 as they emerge from 11 classes of contributing one - loop diagrams .",
    "ultraviolet and infrared divergencies are both treated by the method of dimensional regularization which ensures gauge invariance at every step .",
    "while the ultraviolet divergences can be absorbed in renormalization constants , the cancellation of infrared divergencies requires the inclusion of soft photon radiation below an experimental detection threshold @xmath4 .",
    "the total finite radiative correction depends then logarithmically on the small energy resolution scale @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the radiative corrections become maximal in backward directions , reaching about @xmath5 at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath35 for @xmath36mev .",
    "with such a size and kinematical signature the radiative corrections are not negligible in comparison to the effects from the pion polarizabilities , which also show up preferentially in the backward directions .",
    "furthermore , we include in our calculation of the radiative corrections also the leading pion structure effect through a two - photon contact - vertex proportional to the pion polarizability difference @xmath37@xmath9 .",
    "we find that these structure effects do not modify the relative size and angular dependence of the radiative corrections .",
    "our results can be utilized for analyzing the compass experiment at cern .",
    "we start out with defining the invariant amplitudes for the ( real ) pion compton scattering process : @xmath38 .",
    "it is advantageous to work in the center - of - mass frame and to choose ( in this frame ) the coulomb gauge @xmath39 for the ( transverse ) photon polarization vectors .",

    "before we turn to the explicit evaluation of the one - photon loop diagrams in the next section we add several remarks about regularization and renormalization .",
    "we use the method of dimensional regularization to treat both ultraviolet and infrared divergencies ( where the latter are caused by the masslessness of the photon ) .",
    "the method consists in calculating loop integrals in @xmath58 spacetime dimensions and expanding the results around @xmath59",
    ". divergent pieces of one - loop integrals generically show up in form of the composite constant : @xmath60 containing a simple pole at @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , @xmath61 is the euler - mascheroni number and @xmath62 an arbitrary mass scale introduced in dimensional regularization in order to keep the mass dimension of the loop integrals independent of @xmath58 .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergencies are distinguished by the feature of whether the condition for convergence of the @xmath58-dimensional integral is @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "we discriminate them in the notation by putting appropriate subscripts , i.e. @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the actual calculation",
    "an infrared divergent term originates typically from a feynman parameter integral of the form : @xmath67 .",
    "since scalar quantum electrodynamics is a multiplicatively renormalizable field theory , all ( ultraviolet ) divergencies can be absorbed in renormalization constants @xmath68 ( see appendix a in ref.@xcite ) .",

    "in this section , we present analytical results for the radiative corrections of order @xmath79 to the invariant amplitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 of pion compton scattering .",
    "our convenient choice of coulomb gauge ( in the center - of - mass frame ) eliminates still all @xmath46-channel pole diagrams since for these either the initial state or final state photon coupling vanishes identically . dropping also the diagrams with a tadpole - type self - energy insertion ( the loop consisting of a single virtual photon line , which is set to zero in dimensional regularization ) we are left with the 20 one - photon loop diagrams shown in fig.2 . for the purpose of an ordering scheme they have been divided into classes i - xi . due to an increasing number of internal pion propagators their evaluation rises in complexity . in order to simplify all calculations , we exploit gauge invariance and employ the feynman gauge where the photon propagator is just proportional to the minkowski metric tensor @xmath80 .",

    "the issue of coulomb - strong interaction interference in pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung has been studied recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "according to this work it is advantageous to restrict oneself to momentum transfers @xmath181mev @xmath182 , since there the ratio between polarizability and born contributions remains essentially the same as for real pion compton scattering .",
    "we want to point out here , that for the purpose of determining the pion polarizabilities ( i.e. the dominant difference @xmath153 ) one can omit the whole extrapolation procedure and directly analyze the pion bremsstrahlung process as it is measured in the laboratory frame .",
    "the relevant ingredients to the cross section ( at sufficiently low momentum transfers @xmath183 where the one - photon exchange dominates ) are summarized in this appendix .",
    "consider the pion bremsstrahlung process , @xmath184 , where a virtual photon transfers the ( small ) momentum @xmath185 from the nucleus ( of charge @xmath186 ) to the pion .",
    "the extremely small recoil energy @xmath187 of the nucleus can be neglected .",
    "the fivefold differential cross section in the laboratory frame reads @xcite : @xmath188 with @xmath189 and @xmath190 the squared amplitude summed over the final state photon polarizations @xmath191 : @xmath192 this expression has been derived from a t - matrix for the virtual compton scattering process , @xmath193 , of the form @xmath194 with @xmath195 and @xmath196 two ( real ) amplitudes . @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the angles between the momentum vectors @xmath199 and @xmath200 and @xmath201 , respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath202 is the angle between the two planes spanned by @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the ( three ) tree diagrams of scalar quantum electrodynamics lead to the following contributions to the amplitudes @xmath195 and @xmath196 : @xmath205 with @xmath206 the initial energy of the pion , @xmath207 the final energy of the pion and @xmath208 .",
    "the photon energy is denoted by @xmath209 .",
    "note that the diagram involving the two - photon contact - vertex of scalar qed vanishes here , due to the orthogonality of the time - like virtual photon and the space - like real photon polarizations , @xmath210 .",
    "the contributions from the pion electric and magnetic polarizabilities ( taking @xmath211 as a good approximation ) read : @xmath212 it follows directly from the s - matrix insertion in eq.(27 ) evaluated in the present kinematical situation , @xmath193 . at the same order ( in the small momentum expansion )",
    "there are the pion - loop corrections of chiral perturbation theory @xcite . on the one hand side ,",
    "they introduce the charge form factor of the pion : @xmath213 with @xmath214@xmath215 @xcite the mean square charge radius of the pion , @xmath216mev the pion decay constant , and the logarithmic loop function : @xmath217        as a result , the tree level born terms , @xmath218 and @xmath219 in eq.(39 ) , have then to be multiplied by the pion charge form factor @xmath220 , because a virtual photon ( with @xmath221 ) coupling to the pion can resolve this part of structure of the pion .",
    "moreover and specific for ( virtual ) compton scattering , there is the pion - loop diagram shown in fig.5 .",
    "it describes photon scattering off the  pion - cloud around the pion  and leads to the following contribution @xcite : @xmath222\\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2 q \\sqrt{4m_\\pi^2 + q^2}\\,\\tilde l(q )   -{2q^2 \\over \\tau } \\sqrt{4m_\\pi^2   + \\tau^2}\\ , \\tilde l(\\tau ) \\bigg\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this irreducible loop contribution depends on both , the photon virtuality @xmath180 and the squared invariant momentum transfer @xmath223 between the initial and final state pion , with @xmath224 where @xmath225 . in the cross section",
    ", the pion - loop correction in eq.(43 ) compensates in part the effects from the pion polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to include it in the analysis of pion bremsstrahlung data , if one wants to extract reliably the pion polarizability difference @xmath226 .",
    "of course , there are yet the one - photon loop radiative corrections to virtual pion compton scattering @xmath193 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "these will be presented ( in the same style as done here for real pion compton scattering ) in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
