    "photonic crystals ( pcs ) were first introduced theoretically by yablonovitch @xcite . , and experimentally by john @xcite .",
    "pcs , constructed with periodic structure of artificial dielectrics or metallic materials , have attracted many researchers in the past two decades for their unique electromagnetic properties and scientific and engineering applications @xcite .",
    "these crystals indicate a range of forbidden frequencies , called photonic band gap , as a result of bragg scattering of the electromagnetic waves passing through such a periodical structure @xcite . as the periodicity of the structure",
    "is broken by introducing a layer with different optical properties , a localized defect mode will appear inside the band gap .",
    "enormous potential applications of pcs with defect layers in different areas , such as light emitting diodes , filters and fabrication of lasers have made such structures are interesting research topic in this field .",
    "negative index materials ( nims ) with simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability , known as left - handed materials or metamaterials , were introduced by veselago @xcite nearly forty years ago .",
    "after the experimental realization of metamaterials by smith et al .",
    "@xcite , such materials have received attention for their very unusual electromagnetic properties @xcite . by possibility of manufacturing pcs with metamaterials , called metamaterial photonic crystals ( mpcs ) in recent years",
    ", a new research area was opened to researchers where numerous interesting results have been reported so far . among the papers published in mpcs properties ,",
    "there are a number of reports in such structures with defect layers .",
    "the properties of the defect modes in different one - dimensional ( 1d ) conventional pc and 1d mpc have been reported by several authors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the characteristic matrix method is used to investigate the effects of the lossless negative and positive defect layers on the defect modes in 1d lossy mpc transmission spectra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the mpc structure and theoretical formulation ( characteristic matrix method ) are described in section 2 , the numerical results and discussions are presented in section 3 and the paper is concluded in section 4 .",
    "a schematic diagram of a one - dimensional mpc structure with defect layer is shown in figure 1 . the mpc structure is composed of alternative nim layers ( layers _ a _ ) and pim layers ( layers _ b _ ) , where nim is dispersive and dissipative . the thickness and the refractive index of the layers are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . layer _",
    "c _ is a defect layer and is assumed to be a lossless and non dispersive material with thickness and refractive index of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the calculations are performed using the characteristic matrix method @xcite , which is the most effective technique to analyze the transmission properties of pcs .",
    "the characteristic matrix of the structure is given by :    @xmath6=(m_{a } m_{b})^{n/2 } m_{c } ( m_{b } m_{a})^{n/2}$ ]    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the characteristic matrices of layers _ a _ , _ b _ , and _",
    "c_. the characteristic matrix @xmath10 for te waves at incidence angle @xmath11 in vacuum is given by @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , _ c _ is speed of light in vacuum , @xmath14 is the angle of refraction inside the layer _",
    "i _ with refractive index @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "the refractive index is given as @xmath18 @xcite , where the positive and negative signs are assigned for the pim and nim layers , respectively .",
    "the final characteristic matrix for an _ n _ period structure is given by : @xmath19^n= \\prod^n_{i=1 } m_i \\equiv \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } m_{11 }   &   m_{12}\\\\ m_{21 }   &   m_{22 } \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the matrix elements of @xmath21^n$ ] .",
    "the transmission coefficient of the multilayer is calculated by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the transmissivity of the multilayer is given by @xmath25    the transmissivity of the multilayer for tm waves can be obtained by changing @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the permittivity and permeability of layer _ a _ with negative refracting index in the microwave region are complex and are defined as @xcite , @xmath29 @xmath30 where _ f _ and @xmath31 are the frequency and damping frequency in ghz , respectively .",
    "the behaviours of the real parts of the permittivity and permeability of layer _ a _ , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , versus frequency have been discussed in our previous report @xcite .",
    "the transmission spectrum of the mpc structure was calculated based on the theoretical model described on the previous section .",
    "the calculations are carried out in the region where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are simultaneously negative , where a new gap , called the zero-@xmath34 gap @xcite , will appear @xcite . layer _",
    "b _ is assumed to be the vacuum layer with @xmath35 . the thickness of layers _ a _ and _ b _ are chosen as @xmath36 mm and @xmath37 mm , respectively . the defect layer _",
    "c _ is either nim or pim non dispersive and non dissipative .",
    "the total number of the lattice period is selected to be @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the transmission spectrum for @xmath39 mm with positive refractive index of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for two different loss factors ( @xmath42 ghz and @xmath43 ghz ) and for normal incidence are shown in figure 2 .",
    "as it is clearly seen , the rate of the transmittance and the height of the defect modes are affected by the loss factor .",
    "the frequency of the defect modes as a function of the refractive index of the defect pim and nim layers for normal incidence and for two different small lattice s loss factors are show in figure 3 .",
    "as it is seen , the frequency of the defect modes decreases as @xmath5 increases and the modes are nearly insensitive to the small loss factors .",
    "in addition , for the pim defect layer ( figure 3(a ) ) two defect modes appear for some specified refractive indices .",
    "the behaviour is quite different in the nim defect layer ( figure 3(b ) ) where no defect modes are observed in some specific regions .",
    "the effects of @xmath5 on the height of the defect modes for regions i , ii and iii are shown in figure 3(a ) for pim defect layer and for two different loss factors in figure 4 .",
    "it is seen that the height of the defect modes almost quadratically depends on the refractive index .",
    "the minimum height decreases for the regions with large @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the height of the modes is very sensitive to the loss factor and decreases as @xmath31 increases .",
    "the transmission spectrum for @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 mm and for two different loss factors ( @xmath42 ghz and @xmath47 ghz ) are presented in figure 5 .",
    "as it is seen , the frequency of the defect modes move toward the lower frequencies ( figure 5(a ) ) and the height of modes decrease as the thickness of the defect layer increases ( figure 5(b ) ) .",
    "the behaviors of the frequency and height of the defect modes versus @xmath4 for two different @xmath31 are shown in figures 6 and 7 , respectively . as it is seen , the frequency of the defect modes is nearly insensitive to the loss factors but the height is very sensitive to @xmath31 and decreases as the loss factors increases .    in this section , the effects of the incidence angle on the defect transmission spectra are investigated .",
    "the transmission spectra of te and tm polarized waves for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 incidence angles for @xmath52 mm , @xmath53 , and for two different loss factors ( @xmath42 ghz and @xmath47 ghz ) are shown in figures 8 and 9 , respectively .    as it is observed from figure 8 , and reported in @xcite , the width , the depth and the central frequency of the band gap for te waves increase as the incidence angle increases .",
    "but , for tm waves , the gap disappears for the incidence angles greater than @xmath54 . as @xmath11 increases the width and the depth of gap decrease and the central frequency shifts toward the higher frequencies ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the defect mode s frequency for te and tm waves as a function of the incidence angle for two different loss factors are shown in figure 10 .",
    "here it is clearly seen that the frequency of the defect mode is nearly insensitive to the small loss factor and it disappears for tm waves for the incidence angle greater than @xmath54 .",
    "the change of the height of the defect mode for both polarizations as a function of the incidence angle for two different loss factors is shown in figure 11 .",
    "it is seen that the height of the defect modes decreases for te polarized waves while it increases for tm polarized waves as the incidence angle increases .",
    "it is also seen that the height of the modes are very sensitive to the loss factor for both polarizations .    in the last part",
    "the effects of the number of the lattice period , _",
    "n _ , and the loss factor on the transmission properties of the defect mode are studied .",
    "so far @xmath38 was assumed .",
    "the results are presented in figures 12 and 13 for normal incidence angle . as it is seen from figure 12(a ) and as reported in @xcite , the width of the band gap for @xmath55 is almost independent of _ n_. however the depth and the height of the defect mode reduce as _",
    "n _ increases for @xmath42 ghz .",
    "it is interesting to note that the frequency of the defect mode remains unchanged but the width of the mode decreases as the number of the lattice period increases ( figure 12(b ) ) .",
    "the transmission spectra of the structure for four different loss factors and for @xmath38 are shown in figure 13 . as it is seen from figure 13(a )",
    "the width and the depth of the band gap and the frequency of the defect mode are nearly insensitive to small loss factor but the transmission is affected by @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the height of the defect mode decreases as the loss factor increases ( figure 13(b ) ) .",
    "in this paper the transmission properties of one - dimensional lossy photonic crystals with negative and positive refractive indices layers and a lossless defect layer at the center of the crystal were investigated by characteristic matrix method .",
    "it was shown that by adding a lossless defect layer to a 1d lossy mpc , a localized defect mode appears inside the band gap .",
    "the position of the defect mode depends on the physical properties of the defect layer such as the refractive index and thickness but it is independent of the loss factor .",
    "the results show that as the refractive index and thickness of the defect layer increases the frequency of the defect mode decreases .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the frequency and the height of the defect mode are sensitive to the incidence angle and polarization . for a pim defect layer with the refractive index between @xmath56 to @xmath57 ,",
    "two defect modes appear in a specific range of the transmittance spectrum , while for an nim defect layer the spectrum is quite different where no defect modes is observed in a certain range of the refractive index ( @xmath58 to @xmath59 ) .",
    "the absence of the defect mode in some specified region is not clear and is the subject of our future studies .",
    "it was also seen that : _ i _ ) by increasing the incidence angle the frequency of the defect mode increases . _ ii _ ) by increasing the thickness of the defect layer the frequency of the defect mode moves toward lower frequencies .",
    "_ iii _ ) the height of the defect modes is very sensitive to the loss factors .",
    "_ iv _ ) the depth of the band gap increases and consequently the height and the width of the defect mode decrease , so the mode becomes narrower for @xmath55 .",
    "_ v _ ) the width and the depth of the band gap and the frequency of the defect modes are nearly insensitive to small loss factors but the height of the defect mode is very sensitive to small @xmath31 and decreases as the loss factor increases .",
    "such properties are quite useful in designing new types of optical devices in microwave engineering .    99",
