    "the homogeneous and isotropic universe model has enjoyed great success in explaining the observational data . by contrast , as anyone well knows , our universe is not exactly homogeneous and includes a lot of objects which serve as local nonlinear inhomogeneity .",
    "usually , effects of local non - linear structures on the global property of the universe are considered by intuitive way or using some approximate methods .",
    "one of the effective ways to test the validity of our intuition or the approximation is to construct and study an exact or almost exact solution of the field equations , which may not be so realistic but should be able to fully describe non - linear effects in an inhomogeneous universe model .",
    "one example of exact inhomogeneous solutions is the so - called swiss - cheese universe model @xcite : the dust in arbitrary number of non - overlapping spherical regions is removed in a model of the homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with dust , and then each removed region is filled with a schwarzschild black hole of the same mass as that of the removed dust .",
    "the remaining dust filled region , which is corresponding to  cheese \" , is playing a role of the glue to connect schwarzschild patches .",
    "however , due to the existence of the cheese region , the swiss - cheese model may be too special to see significant effects of local inhomogeneities on the global evolution of the universe .",
    "hence , it is important to study a universe model in which black holes are uniformly distributed without the cheese region .",
    "we call such an inhomogeneous universe model the  black hole universe \" in this paper .    about this issue",

    "they divided a virtual 3-sphere into @xmath0 cells",
    "( @xmath15 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 120 and 600 ) and put a black hole portion of the schwarzschild spacetime on a spherical region centered in each cell .",
    "then they derived the equation of motion for this  lattice universe \" from junction conditions between the schwarzschild cell and the 3-sphere .",
    "it is demonstrated that the maximal radius of the lattice universe asymptotes to that of the corresponding homogeneous and isotropic closed universe filled with dust in the limit of the large number of black holes .",
    "here we should note that the lattice universe is not an exact solution and there are gaps between each schwarzschild black holes ( see a figure 3 in ref .",

    "our purpose in this paper is to numerically construct initial data of the black hole universe . as a first step , we consider regularly aligned black holes with an identical mass . by its symmetry",
    ", no anisotropic relative velocities between neighboring black holes will appear , and this system is similar to a cold gas , i.e. , dust . in order to obtain such initial data sets",

    "one of the fascinating issues of inhomogeneous universe models is the so - called averaging problem .",

    ". however , the effect of local inhomogeneities on the global expansion definitely exists and the expansion history may be different from that of the homogeneous and isotropic universe@xcite .",

    "significant differences between our present work and ref .",
    "@xcite is the spatial topology and the existence of the cosmic volume expansion . in our present case ,",
    "the spatial topology is @xmath2 with one point removed , and the expansion rate is finite while the initial date sets considered in ref .",
    "@xcite have a topology of @xmath3 with @xmath0 points removed , and their expansion rates vanish , i.e. , time symmetric .",
    "one of remarkable advantages of our work over ref .",
    "@xcite is that a dynamical simulation of expanding universe is possible starting from our initial data , while only contracting universe is possible with the initial data given in ref .",
    "to solve this issue , we need to rely on numerical relativity .",
    "our work may be the first step for the concrete analysis of the effects of non - linear inhomogeneities in expanding universes .",
    "although we can not address the real time evolution of the black hole universe yet , the one - parameter family of initial data sets can be regarded as a fictitious time evolution of the black hole universe . using the initial data sets , we study the cosmic volume expansion rate of the black hole universe model in sec .",

    "the gravitational force is given by the spatial gradient of the newtonian potential @xmath180 which is related to the conformal factor @xmath16 by @xmath181 , and thus the newtonian potential is obtained by solving the hamiltonian constraint , which gives the hubble equation after averaging . since the metric is assumed to be almost equal to that of the eds universe model , the term proportional to @xmath182 should be so small that it is a negligible higher order correction in the hamiltonian constraint .",

    "[ fig : hubble ] suggests that the deviation of @xmath188 from @xmath49 decreases with larger @xmath206 , and hence it seems that the newtonian @xmath0-body simulation becomes correct asymptotically for @xmath207 .",

    "however , in order to get definite conclusion , the investigation of the time evolution is necessary .     as a function of @xmath117 . ]",
    "in this paper , we have constructed numerically the initial data of an expanding universe model which is composed of regularly aligned black holes .",
    "this system is equivalent to a black hole located at the center @xmath35 of a cubic domain @xmath39 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the black hole is represented by a structure like the einstein - rosen bridge , and thus @xmath35 corresponds to the asymptotically flat spatial infinity .",
    "since the physical domain does not include infinity , the physical domain is @xmath39 with @xmath35 removed , i.e. , @xmath138 whose topology is @xmath2 with one point removed .",

    "these requirements are compatible with a finite expansion rate of the universe and the puncture method to numerically treat a black hole , respectively",
    ". then , we can solve constraint equations by giving the parameter @xmath117 , where @xmath114 is the coordinate length of an edge of the cubic domain @xmath39 , and @xmath157 gives a coordinate value which is almost equal to the coordinate radius of the black hole horizon .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is determined so that the integral of the hamiltonian constraint over @xmath138 is compatible with the periodic boundary conditions ; this integral leads to the effective hubble equation .",
    "we find from numerically obtained solutions that the neighborhoods of vertices of @xmath39 are well approximated by the milne universe , whereas the other region remains inhomogeneous even in the case of @xmath211 .",

    ", we studied the relation between the effective mass density @xmath74 of black holes and the effective hubble parameter @xmath49 , which are defined in a simple and natural way .",

    "once we regard our one parameter family of initial data sets as fictitious time evolution of the black hole universe , our result would imply that the hubble equation of the eds universe would be realized when the universe expands enough .",
    "the validity of the newtonian approximation in the system has also been discussed .",
    "we numerically solved the hamiltonian constraint equation simplified by the cosmological newtonian approximation and compared it with the full solution with fixed @xmath117 .",
    "we found that the deviation of the spatial metric obtained by the cosmological newtonian approximation from that of the full calculation is less than 1% for @xmath213 around the boundary of @xmath39 and better for larger values of @xmath117 .",
    "however , the deviation of the hubble parameter defined in the cosmological newtonian approximation scheme and full relativistic one is 20% even for @xmath213 .",
    "thus , we may say that , as expected , the backreaction effects of the inhomogeneities on the cosmic volume expansion is very large in the case of @xmath205 . however , we may also say that , for the larger @xmath117 , the backreaction effects become smaller .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the backreaction effect acts as the brake for the cosmic volume expansion .",
    "although our results in this paper agree with naive expectations , it is not clear by the present analysis if the dynamics of the black hole universe can be described by the eds universe on average or not . because the black hole universe can not be exactly the eds universe and the effect of inhomogeneities definitely exists .",
    "for instance , if we have an effective positive curvature term on average as the effect of the inhomogeneities , the black hole universe eventually re - collapses .",
    "the effect of the inhomogeneities might give a qualitative difference of the global expansion history of the universe@xcite .",
