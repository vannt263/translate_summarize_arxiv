    "undoubtedly , the single most important quantity in ( classical ) information theory is the shannon entropy , and its properties play a key role : for a discrete probability distribution @xmath0 on @xmath1 @xmath2 the quantum ( von neumann ) entropy is understood to be of equal importance to quantum information : for a quantum state ( density operator ) @xmath3 , @xmath4 [ eqdef : s ] s ( ) = - which reduces to when @xmath5 is diagonal .    for @xmath6-party systems",
    ", one can apply these definitions to obtain the entropy of all marginal probability distributions ( in the classical case ) and reduced density operators ( aka quantum marginals ) in the quantum case .",
    "the collection of these entropies can be regarded as a vector in @xmath7 , and the collection of all such vectors forms a set whose closure is a convex cone .",
    "it is an interesting open question to determine the inequalities which characterize this cone .",
    "as discussed in section  [ nonshan ] , it is now known that in the classical setting the shannon inequalities given below do not suffice ; they describe a strictly larger cone .",
    "this work has motivated us to consider analogous questions for the von neumann entropy in @xmath6-party quantum systems .",
    "although we are unable to answer this question , we can fully characterize the cone associated with a subset of quantum states known as stabiliser states in the 4-party case .",
    "moreover , we can show that for any number of parties , entropy vectors for stabiliser states satisfy additional inequalities in the class known as linear rank inequalities discussed in section  [ sect : linrank ] . in the classical setting , distributions whose entropies satisfy this subclass of stronger inequalities , suffice to achieve maximum throughput in certain network coding problems @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the classical shannon entropy for an @xmath6-party classical probability distribution @xmath0 on a discrete space @xmath8 , has the following properties , commonly known as the _ shannon inequalities _ :    1 .",

    "the monotonicity property implies that if @xmath17 then @xmath18 for all @xmath19 and , thus , @xmath20 is a product of point masses .",
    "some of the most remarkable features of quantum systems arise when is violated . indeed , for a pure entangled state @xmath21 for which @xmath22 , but the entropy of the reduced states @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be ( and usually is ) strictly positive .",

    "strong subadditivity : @xmath32 3 .",
    "weak monotonicity : @xmath33    however , in contrast to the classical setting , this weaker version of monotonicity is not completely independent of strong subadditivity . in fact , it can be obtained from the latter by the ( non - linear ) process known as _ purification _",
    "described in section  [ sect : pure ] . using a slight abuse of notation , we use @xmath34 and @xmath35 to denote , respectively , the mutual information and conditional mutual information for both classical and quantum systems , defined explicitly in the latter case as @xmath36 for pairwise disjoint sets @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath37 .",

    "the first non - shannon entropy inequality was obtained in 1997 - 98 by yeung and zhang  @xcite for @xmath39-party systems .",
    "their work established that the classical entropy cone is strictly smaller than the polyhedral cone defined by the shannon inequalities .",
    "this was the only non - shannon inequality known until 2006 , when dougherty , freiling and zeger  @xcite used a computer search to generate new inequalities .",
    "then mat  @xcite found two infinite families , one of which can be written as [ eq : matus - s ] t ( ab : cd ) + i(a : b|d ) + & & 0 where @xmath40 is a non - negative integer , and @xmath41 is defined in below .",
    "the case @xmath42 in yields the inequality in @xcite . moreover , either of the mat families can be used to show that the 4-party entropy cone is not polyhedral . in @xcite additional non - shannon inequalities were found . in the quantum setting ,",
    "lieb  @xcite considered the question of additional inequalities in a form that could be regarded as extending ssa to more parties , but found none .",
    "much later pippenger  @xcite rediscovered one of lieb s results and used it to show constructively that there are no additional inequalities for 3-party systems .",
    "he also explicitly raised the question of whether or not additional inequalities hold for more parties . despite the fact that is still the only known inequality ,",

    "[ sect : linrank ] we discuss what is known about linear rank inequalities beginning with the ingleton inequality in section  [ sect : ing ] and concluding with a discussion of their connection to the notion of common information in section  [ comminfo ] . in section  [",
    "sect : stab ] we discuss stabiliser states , beginning with some basic definitions in section  [ stabdefs ] . in section  [ sect : stab.ent ] we consider the entropies of stabiliser states , showing half of our main result that pure stabiliser states generate entropy vectors which satisfy the ingleton inequality and a large class of other linear rank inequalities . in section  [ sect:4party ]",
    "we prove the other half , _",
    "i.e. _ , that all extremal rays of the 4-party ingleton cone can be achieved using 5-party stabiliser states .",
    "we conclude with some open questions and challenges .",
    "we now introduce some notation needed to make precise the notion of entropy vectors and entropy cones . we will let @xmath43 denote an index set of finite size @xmath44 so that in many cases we could just assume that @xmath45 .",
    "however , it will occasionally be useful to consider the partition of some the index set into smaller groups , e.g , by grouping @xmath28 and @xmath29 as well as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 gives rise to a @xmath49-element @xmath50 .",
    "when the size of @xmath51 is important , we write @xmath52 .    an arbitrary @xmath6-partite quantum system is associated with a hilbert space @xmath53 ( with no restrictions on the dimension of the hilbert spaces @xmath54 ) with @xmath55 .",
    "the reduced states ( properly called reduced density operators , but more often referred to as reduced density matrices ( rdm ) and also known as quantum marginals ) are given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",

    "we study the question of which such vectors arise from classical or quantum states , _",
    "i.e. _ , when their elements are given by the entropies @xmath63 of the reduced states of some @xmath6-party quantum state .",
    "classical probability distributions can be embedded into the quantum framework by restricting density matrices to those which are diagonal in a fixed product basis .",
    "a function @xmath64 , associating real numbers to the subsets of a finite set @xmath51 , which satisfies the shannon inequalities , eqs .

    "the existence of non - shannon entropy inequalities implies that there are vectors in @xmath66 which can not be achieved by any classical state .",
    "neither the classical nor quantum set of true entropy vectors is convex , because their boundaries have a complicated structure @xcite .",
    "however , the closure of the set of classical or quantum entropy vectors , which we denote @xmath68 or @xmath69 , respectively , is a closed convex cone .",
    "the inclusion @xmath70 is strict for @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "it is an important open question whether or not this also holds in the quantum setting , _",
    "i.e. _ , is the inclusion @xmath72 also strict ?    in this paper , we consider entropy vectors which satisfy additional inequalities known as linear rank inequalities , i.e. those satisfied by the dimensions of subspaces of a vector space and their intersections .",

    "it is well - known that any pure state @xmath83 can be written in the form = _ k _ k with @xmath84 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 orthonormal . indeed , this is an immediate consequence of the isomorphism between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the set of linear operators from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , and the singular value decomposition .",
    "it then follows that both @xmath89 and @xmath90 have the same non - zero eigenvalues @xmath91 , and hence @xmath92 .",

    "conversely , chan and yeung @xcite have shown that every such relation for groups , is valid for all entropic poly - matroids .",
    "this result motivates the search for a similar , combinatorial or group theoretical , characterization of the von neumann entropic poly - quantoids , and our interest in stabiliser states originally grew out of it .",
    "however , it must be noted that if some subgroups of @xmath104 are not general , but , e .. g , normal subgroups as in theorem  [ thm : normsubgp ] below , then the chan - yeung correspondence breaks down . in this case",

    "( this was observed in @xcite and also follows from theorem  [ thm : normsubgp ] . )    to complete the argument , it suffices to observe that the ingleton inequality is balanced , so that the ingleton expression is identically zero for the sum - type `` rank function '' from the second term in , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath272 defines a poly - matroid satisfying ( [ eq : ingleton ] ) with equality .",
    "any linear combination of mutual informations and conditional mutual informations is a balanced expression ( and vice versa , any balanced expression can be written as such a linear combination ) .",

    "therefore , we can conclude using the same argument as above that    any pure stabiliser state on an @xmath97-party system generate an @xmath6-party entropy vector which satisfies the kinser @xcite family of inequalities , and more generally those of dougherty et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a consequence of theorem  [ thm : stab - ingleton ] is that the family of inequalities holds for stabiliser states ; however , rays generated by the stabiliser state entropy vectors do not span the entropy cone @xmath273 .",
    "in fact , from the proof of theorem  [ thm : stab - ingleton ] , we see that _ every _ balanced inequality that holds for the shannon entropy , holds automatically for stabilizer quantum entropies .",
    "note also that apart from , all other necessary entropy inequalities for the shannon entropy are balanced  @xcite .",
    "by direct calculation using symbolic software , we can compute the extreme rays of @xmath39-party poly - quantoids plus ingleton inequalities .",
    "the results are given ( up to permutation ) as rays 0 to 6 in table  1 below , as elements of the 5-party cone @xmath274 ( on subsets of @xmath275 ) of vectors which satisfy ( @xmath100 ) and the complementarity property @xmath101 as described at the end of section  [ sect : pure ] .",
    ".extreme rays of the 4-party quantum ingleton cone [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the following stabiliser states found by ibinson @xcite ( some of which were known earlier ) realise entropy vectors on the rays 1 through 6 shown in table  1 .",
    "@xmath276 where in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r5 ] ) , @xmath277 and @xmath278 are the logical @xmath279 and @xmath187 on the famous @xmath154-qubit code  @xcite .",
    "these are also extremal rays of the quantum entropy cone @xmath280 .",
    "in addition , ray 0 in table  1 is realised by the ( stabiliser ! ) state @xmath281 on @xmath282 qubits .",
    "let us call an @xmath6-party poly - quantoid _ stabiliser - represented _ , if it is in the closure of the cone generated by the entropy vectors of @xmath97-party stabiliser states in the sense used above .",
    "then the above reasoning proves the following analogue of a theorem by hammer , romashchenko , shen and vereshchagin  @xcite :    [ thm : stabiliser - quantoids ] a @xmath39-party poly - quantoid is stabiliser - represented if and only if it satisfies the ingleton inequality ( and all its permutations ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to conjecture that the closure of the cone generated by the entropy vectors of stabiliser states is identical to that obtained when inequalities obtained from common information as in @xcite are added to the classical ones .",
    "however , it is not even clear if stabiliser states satisfy the additional linear rank inequalities shown to exist in @xcite .",
    "the difficult question of whether or not the quantum entropy satisfies inequalities beyond positivity and ssa remains open for four or more parties .",
    "do quantum states which do not satisfy ingleton always lie within the classical part of the quantum entropy cone ?",
    "we know that the quantum entropy cone @xmath283 is strictly larger than the classical one @xmath284 .",
    "recall that @xmath285 denotes the polyhedral cones formed from the classical inequalities ( in each case ) and the ingleton inequality .",
    "we want to know whether or not @xmath286 is strictly larger than @xmath287 , _",
    "i.e. _ , are there quantum states whose entropy vectors do not satisfy the ingleton inequality and are not equal to any vector in the closure of the classical entropy cone , @xmath288 ? if the answer is negative , then @xmath39-party quantum entropy vectors must also satisfy the new non - shannon inequalities .",
    "this question extends naturally to the 5-party case , in which all linear rank inequalities are known from @xcite .",
    "however , for more parties , one can ask the same question for both the cones associated with inequalities obtained using one common information as in @xcite , and for the cones obtained using all linear rank inequalities .",
    "although we know from @xcite that additional inequalities are required , we do not even have explicit examples to consider .",
    "after completion of the present research , we became aware of independent work by gross and walter @xcite , who use discrete phase space methods for stabilizer states to show that the entropies of stabilizer states satisfy all balanced classical entropy inequalities .",
