    "the advent of large ground - based telescopes and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) has made it possible to resolve faint individual stars in nearby galaxies , thereby enabling us to study galactic archaeology for such external galaxies in the same way that one studies our home galaxy , the milky way .",
    "in particular , our knowledge of the stellar halo of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) has dramatically expanded over the last two decades .",
    "indeed , m31 provides us with a global yet detailed view of a galaxy with a similar morphology to the milky way .",
    "the most significant discovery in the m31 halo is probably its complex substructures such as the giant southern stream ( gss ) in the outer halo @xcite .",
    "this andromeda gss has attracted particular attention , as it reveals an on - going hierarchical formation process of m31 and thus places invaluable constraints on galaxy formation models .",
    "the gss contains a high concentration of metal - rich stars @xcite and is located behind m31 with a significant degree of elongation along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered significant substructures around m31 by mapping red giant branch ( rgb ) stars with the isaac newton telescope .",
    "the gss was once thought to be tidal debris dispersed by interactions with m32 or ngc  205 as judged from its projected trajectory on the sky @xcite , but subsequent studies have revealed that it is probably not related to these two satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , spectroscopic observations of gss stars with keck / deimos revealed that they show a markedly different radial motion from m32 and ngc  205 .",
    "recently , @xmath17-body numerical simulations have been performed in view of these kinematic results and these have showed that the gss s progenitor had a highly eccentric orbit and a mass of about @xmath18 m@xmath19 @xcite . furthermore , deep photometric observations with _",
    "hst_/acs reaching down to below the main - sequence turn - off @xcite detected intermediate - age stars in a gss field located at a projected distance of @xmath20 kpc from the m31 center as well as in the general halo field at @xmath21 kpc along the southern minor axis @xcite .",
    "in spite of these detailed studies however , it remains unclear what the detailed properties of the gss s progenitor galaxy are .",
    "besides , we do not fully understand the connection between the gss and the other substructures in the m31 halo such as the ne- and w - shelves , although the latest simulations @xcite imply a connection among them . to unveil the origin of the gss , it is of particular importance to carry out the detailed analysis of its stellar populations by assembling a statistically significant set of observational data such as color , metallicity , and age distributions of the stars , in addition to the other halo fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "stellar halos generally have such low surface brightness ( sb ) that detecting them beyond the milky way is a major challenge .",
    "for example , @xcite estimate the sb of the galactic halo at the solar radius to be @xmath22 mag arcsec@xmath23 .",
    "the m31 halo was long believed to be an outward extension of its bulge , since surprisingly metal - rich stars ( @xmath24\\rangle\\sim -0.6 $ ] ) were found in the inner halo of m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the sb profile measured along the south - east minor axis from integrated light and resolved star counts follows a de vaucouleurs @xmath25 profile out to @xmath20  kpc @xcite , quite unlike the power - law behavior deduced for the halo of the milky way . both the de vaucouleurs profile and high metallicity are suggestive of an active merger history for the halo ( or bulge ) component of m31 .    the existence of metal - rich populations in the m31 halo has been confirmed by several subsequent studies .",
    "@xcite found that a high - metallicity population with @xmath26 } \\sim -0.5 $ ] is dominated in a field located at @xmath20 kpc along the south - east minor axis , based on a wide - field mosaic ccd camera on cfht .",
    "they also discovered that 30%40% of the stars at this location belong to a metal - poor population .",
    "furthermore , in their later complementary paper @xcite , they showed that a similar high - metallicity population is distributed in a field at @xmath27 kpc along the south - east minor axis .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the outer halo shows little or no radial metallicity gradient .",
    "_ hst _ has made great contributions to the exploration of the inner halo populations of m31 . using _",
    "@xcite analyzed the data for 16 fields at different distances from the m31 center , from @xmath28 to 35 kpc , down to limiting @xmath29 and @xmath1 magnitudes of @xmath30 .",
    "from the metallicity distributions in each field , obtained by comparison of the rgb stars with galactic globular cluster templates , they detected similar abundance distributions peaked at @xmath31 } \\sim -0.6 $ ] in all of the sampled fields .",
    "although in some fields a very metal - rich ( @xmath31 } \\geq -0.2 $ ] ) component is clearly present , possibly attributable to disrupted disk populations , they identified no evident metallicity gradient in their limited region .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated m31 inner substructures discovered by @xcite , based on the deep _ hst_/acs survey spanning the range from @xmath32 to 45 kpc reaching a few magnitudes below the rc .",
    "their systematic surveys confirmed that the inner halo of m31 is strongly polluted by metal - rich and intermediate - age populations disrupted from the m31 disk and the gss by interactions between m31 and dwarf galaxies .",
    "brown et al.s studies based on ultra - deep _",
    "hst_/acs observations have unraveled star - formation histories in selected locations of the m31 halo @xcite . with a minimum of 32 orbits per field ,",
    "these observations have been sufficiently deep to resolve stars below the oldest main - sequence turn - off .",
    "@xcite first demonstrated that a minor axis field projected at @xmath21 kpc contains an indisputable population in age ( predominantly 610 gyr ) and abundance ( @xmath31 } > -0.5 $ ] ) .",
    "@xcite present results from inner halo fields they associate with the `` tidal stream , '' `` outer disk , '' and `` spheroid '' . in all cases ,",
    "the fields were shown to have experienced an extended star - formation history , in contrast , they quantified differences between them .",
    "@xcite investigated a field at 21 kpc and found evidence that its population is marginally older and more metal poor than the inner halo field . furthermore , @xcite , based on an additional field at @xmath33 kpc , found that the mean ages ( the mean [ fe / h ] values ) at 11 , 21 and 35 kpc gradually change like 9.7 ( @xmath34 ) , 11.0 ( @xmath35 ) and 10.5 ( @xmath36 ) gyr ( dex ) , respectively .",
    "the inclusion of kinematic information has been extremely useful but has also added another dimension of complexity to the puzzle .",
    "spectroscopic studies of @xcite uncovered successfully the presence of an extended halo component having a power - law sb profile of @xmath37 over the range @xmath27165  kpc resembling the milky way s halo , while the sb of m31 s spheroid at @xmath38  kpc has been known to show an @xmath25 law resembling a galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "they also reported that m31 s halo may extend to @xmath39  kpc , suggesting that halo stars of m31 and the milky way occupy a substantial volume fraction of our local group .",
    "however , it remains to be seen whether this flat portion of the halo profile is affected by substructure .    in the meantime",
    "@xcite analyzed a sample of 29 stars in a field at @xmath40 kpc on the minor axis and found the mean metallicity to be in the range of @xmath31 } = -1.9 $ ] to @xmath41 . despite still remaining uncertainties of calibration and sample selection issues , their estimated mean",
    "metallicity is significantly lower than the results deduced from the above photometric analyses . @xcite and @xcite recently discovered a metal - poor halo out to @xmath42 kpc that is similar to that of the galaxy , both in terms of its metallicity , radial profile , as well as the amount of substructure .    as noted above , the stellar halo of m31 as well as the milky way is filled with quite complex fossil records .",
    "our principal goal is thus to identify each component of the halo and clarify its formation history .",
    "to do so , we need to obtain both the global and local structures in the stellar halo and deduce plausible origins of them .",
    "detailed studies based on large numbers of stars , such as with wide - field imagers , are required to investigate the fundamental nature of the large halo regions in m31 .",
    "indeed , our external viewpoint for this galaxy makes it possible to study the entire area of its halo @xcite ; detailed stellar maps will allow us to detect giant streams as well as a wealth of fainter substructures at sb levels of @xmath43 mag arcsec@xmath23 . in the south - quadrant halo of m31 , ibata et al",
    ". also discovered much fainter stream - like substructures reaching @xmath44 mag arcsec@xmath23 as well as previously unknown surviving dwarf satellites and peculiarly extending outer globular clusters .",
    "the properties of these faint substructures in the outer halo , such as radial distributions of surface brightness and metallicity , have been reproduced by some recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which thus provide us with useful theoretical templates to understand the formation history of the stellar halo .    here",
    "we report on our wide - field , photometric observations of the m31 halo , using subaru / suprime - cam , aimed at obtaining the detailed physical properties of the m31 halo , such as color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , metallicity distributions , surface brightness and age , compared with previous studies using cfht / megacam ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our suprime - cam survey is deeper and covers as - yet unexplored fields along the north - west minor axis of the halo as well as some fields in the south - quadrant halo already explored by other telescopes .",
    "a large set of our imaging data provides an important clue to understanding the complex halo substructures and their origin in the course of the formation history of the m31 halo .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in   [ sec : data ] , we present observations and detailed procedure for calibrating the photometric suprime - cam data . ",
    "[ sec : stream ] is devoted to our results for the quantitative analysis of the gss , including the morphology of the obtained cmds , the distance estimate using the tip of the rgb stars ( trgb ) , their metallicity distribution using the observable globular cluster templates and theoretical isochrones , and their age distribution based on the luminosity distribution of the stars . in ",
    "[ sec : halo ] , we expand our method to the entire regions of the m31 halo in order to globally determine the fundamental properties of the m31 halo . then , we elaborate the technique for separating the foreground and background contaminants .",
    "the spatial distributions of the stellar populations in the m31 halo are also presented in the section .",
    "furthermore , we present the cmds of the detected streams and other spatial substructures , and show the radial profiles and the radial metallicity distributions of the stellar populations in the halo . finally , we discuss the implications of our results and compare with previous studies . in   [ sec : summary ] we draw conclusions and future directions .    throughout this work",
    "we adopt the m31 cepheid distance modulus of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 770 kpc ) from @xcite , if not otherwise specified .",
    "reddening corrections are applied in each field based on the extinction maps of @xcite , and the @xcite reddening law @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we also adopt the convention that @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote , respectively , the projected radius and three - dimensional radius from the m31 center .",
    "in our observational studies of andromeda s stellar halo , we use the suprime - cam imager @xcite on the 8.2-m subaru telescope @xcite on mauna kea in hawaii .",
    "suprime - cam consists of ten @xmath51 ccds with a scale of @xmath52 per pixel and covers a total field - of - view @xmath53 . using this wide - field imager ,",
    "we have carried out a systematic imaging survey of two series of fields far from the m31 center : fields along the minor and major axis of the spheroid ( hereafter referred to as `` halo '' fields ) and fields along the andromeda gss ( `` stream '' fields ) .",
    "our targeted fields of the halo and stream fields are , respectively , located at between 22 and 91  kpc ( figure  [ fig : map ] ) and at @xmath46 32  kpc ( @xmath54 ) from the m31 center .",
    "tables  [ tab : infoobs ] summarizes the names of these targeted fields and their observations .    during four nights in august 2004",
    ", we obtained the suprime - cam image of the one stream field ( hereafter referred to as gss1 ) and also made imaging surveys for eleven halo fields in the south part of m31 ( se19 and sw12 ) .",
    "in addition to these targeted fields , we obtained the imaging data at the control field ( hereafter referred to as compl103bm21 ) to estimate the number of foreground dwarf stars of the milky way and unresolved background galaxies in each m31 s field .",
    "the weather conditions in august 2004 were unfortunately slightly poor , with seeing varying from @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , we carried out additional imaging of gss1 , se1 , se6 , se9 and sw1 on a photometric night in august 2005 in order to calibrate the data . in august 2007 and august 2008 ,",
    "the halo fields in the north part of m31 ( nw115 ) were observed in photometric conditions , along with the control fields ( compl103bm25 and compl103bm16_5 ) .",

    "typical exposure times of each object field observed in 20042005 and 2007 are 1800 sec and 720 sec in @xmath29 and @xmath1 band , respectively , and those in 2008 are 1440 and 2160 sec in @xmath29 and @xmath1 band , respectively , so that the images reach down to magnitude of the rc of m31 . each field",
    "was observed with adequate dithering pattern to cover gaps between adjacent ccd chips .",
    "some of these fields were observed in short exposures of 5 and 10s ( 12 and 15s ) in @xmath29 ( @xmath56 ) bands .",
    "they are used to improve photometric accuracy and to investigate space variation of foreground dwarf stars along the galactic latitude at the same galactic longitude .",
    "in addition , all the targeted fields in the m31 halo are overlapping with neighboring fields in order to calibrate the adjacent fields whose photometric zero points are unknown in poor condition , such as se2 , se3 and so on .    the position angle of each field observed in 20042005 is 0 , i.e. , north is up and east is to the left of each image . in the 20072008",

    "[ fig : cmdgs1cont ] ) .    as in the case of the agb bump , we set tighter limits on the mean magnitude of the rc based on a gaussian - weighted fit to the suitably corrected @xmath1-band lf . the bottom left and right panels of figure  [ fig : lfgs1agbrc ] shows the zooming cmd and the lf near the rc magnitude , as in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : lfgs1agbrc ] for the agb bump .",

    "figure  [ fig : agbrcmag ] shows the corresponding average @xmath1 magnitudes of agb bump and rc features plotted as a linear function of age , where the error bars are evaluated by employing @xmath303 dex shift in the observed mds .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines indicate the measured mean magnitudes of the agb bump and rc .",
    "these magnitude measurements have a negligible statistical error due to a huge number of available stars , but they contain a systematic error associated with reddening and distance uncertainties , which amounts to about @xmath304 mag .",
    "it is worth noting that for metal - poor and old populations with [ m / h ] @xmath305 and age of @xmath306 gyr , the agb bump feature is invisible in the theoretical luminosity functions , and only a very weak feature is present for more metal - rich stars @xcite , so the model predictions for the agb bump with older ages are not shown .",
    "the mean magnitude of the rc in gss1 field indicates that the average age of stars is 7.1 gyr , whereas the agb bump magnitude in the field suggests younger age .",
    "however , as seen in figure  [ fig : agbrcmag ] , the dependence of the agb bump magnitude on age is much weaker than that of the rc , so that small systematic errors in the measured agb bump magnitude can lead to a large difference in the estimated age .",
    "the abundance of @xmath278 elements somewhat affects the agb bump - based age estimation , in such a manner that lower [ @xmath278/fe ] ratios yield older ages ( see open circles for [ @xmath278/fe]@xmath307 in fig .  [ fig : agbrcmag ] ) , whereas the rc - based age estimation is rather insensitive to this effect .",
    "much larger systematics may be caused by the followings : ( 1 ) the agbb feature appears only when [ m / h]@xmath308 and age of @xmath309 gyr , so the mean age of the stars is dominated by relatively metal - rich and thus bright populations .",
    "( 2 ) if the gss contains relatively young populations associated with secondary star formation activities , the mean luminosity of the agbb reflects the relative fraction of each population , especially being biased in favor of younger , brighter populations .",
    "this effect would be more significant for agbb than rc , because the number of the stars in the agbb feature is much small , so the poisson error in the number of the populations , especially for the small number of bright stars among the agbb stars is relatively large , thereby having a larger probability of yielding a brighter agb magnitude and younger ages .",
    "thus , while taking into account that agb bump magnitudes yields younger ages , we adopt the rc - based age estimation , giving upper limits on the age of gss stars . based on the available @xmath1-band magnitude of the rc (",
    "because its @xmath29-band magnitude is unavailable in the current study ) , we arrive at @xmath310 gyr for the mean age of gss stars , where the error includes 0.22 mag systematic uncertainties in the rc magnitude arisen from reddening , distance modulus and so on , while the uncertainties in stellar evolutionary models are not taken into account .",
    "@xcite compared teramo models @xcite with padova models @xcite in their similar study for the stellar population of ngc  5128 and found an additional 1  gyr uncertainty due to the age difference between the two model predictions .",
    "we note that the mean age of gss stars derived from the rc magnitude is slightly younger compared to that derived by @xcite .",
    "they estimated the gss s mean age to be 8.7  gyr and the mean metallicity to be @xmath283[fe / h]@xmath284 based on the main - sequence fitting with the distance modulus of 780 kpc and the victoria - regina isochrones , whereas our re - computed mean age based on the md constructed by the victoria - regina theoretical isochrones ( where the md is shown in the panel ( a ) of the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : metal_err ] ) is 8.1 gyr .",
    "this result is consistent with the gss s mean age found by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mean age and metallicity estimations based on different assumptions as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : metal_err ] are listed in table  [ tab : gsage ] . in particular , all mean ages derived from the agb bump magnitude are much younger than those derived from the rc magnitudes .",
    "the theoretical models provide robust mean ages without assumptions such as @xmath278-enhancement and age to estimate the metallicity , while the ages are somewhat sensitive to the assumption of distance as well as in the case of using the galactic globular cluster templates .",
    "therefore , we note that our technique applied to calculation of mean age based on the rc magnitudes produces several gyr uncertainty in accordance with assumptions such as distance , extinction , @xmath278-enhancement and stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the use of the agb bump magnitude suggests systematically younger ages , although this age estimation is rather sensitive to the accurate determination of the agb bump magnitude .",
    "we note that the presence of the agb bump feature implies the dominance of young and metal - rich populations in the gss ; @xcite reported that in the models with ages @xmath311 gyr there exist very few agb bump stars compared to the rc or horizontal - branch stars and that in metal - poor ( [ m / h]@xmath312 dex ) and old ( age @xmath306 gyr ) models the agb bump is not present at all .",
    "thus , the presence of the agb bump itself yields the younger age estimate .",
    "it is also noted that the current implication for young and metal - rich populations in the gss may be associated with the result of @xcite ( as depicted in their figure 17b ) , suggesting that star formation activities in the gss had continued until some gyrs ago ; it is inferred that the progenitor of the gss may have had three main star formation activities : ( 1 ) 30% of the stars were provided in the first star formation ( e.g. , by the collapse of the initial gas ) before 8 gyrs ago , ( 2 ) 40% of the stars were provided in the second star formation ( e.g. , supernova feedback or galactic interactions ) about 8 gyrs ago , and ( 3 ) remaining 30% of the stars were provided in the third star formation ( e.g. , the tidal interaction in the first pericentric encounter with m31 ) after the second star formation .",
    "the total mass of the stellar system expected for the progenitor galaxy of the gss can be estimated from the mean metallicity of stars in the gss ( [ fe / h]@xmath313 ) , combined with the metallicity - luminosity relation for local group dwarfs @xcite .",

    "however , while the cmd analysis also predicts the lack of metal - rich stars in the more remote outer region , the figure shows the unexpected high fraction of metal - rich stars at @xmath449 kpc .",
    "this is because the derived mean / median metallicities in the outer halo are somewhat overestimated due to the heavy contamination of the galactic disk dwarf stars as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : m31sb ] .",
    "therefore , we re - calculate the mean / median metallicities by imposing a more stringent color cut of @xmath426 , to ensure a minimal contamination from the galactic disk .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : m31md2 ] .",
    "the mean / median metallicities in the south - east region show a systematic decrease of about 0.2 dex while keeping no spatial gradient .",
    "in contrast , the variation in the north - west region based on the stringent color criterion shows now a strong metallicity gradient .",
    "we further test whether this strong metallicity gradient is a real feature or not , in addition to the above - confirmed morphological variation in the cmd along the north - west minor - axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : m31mdsn ] denotes the ratio of the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , plotted as a function of north - west minor - axis distance from the m31 center ( in projection ) , where the s / n ratio means the ratio of the number of objects used to calculate the mean / median metallicity in each summed - up field to the number of the foreground sources in the scaled control field .",
    "the vertical axis of fig .  [ fig : m31mdsn ] means the ratio of the s / n ratio of @xmath426 selection sample to the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath444 selection .",
    "basically , because the vertical value is more than 1.0 in most regions of the north - west halo , the spatial variation of mean / median metallicities based on the stringent color criterion of @xmath426 is statistically more reliable than that based on a @xmath444 color cut .",
    "however , note that the absolute mean / median metallicities are clearly somewhat underestimated in the inner fields with a lot of metal - rich stars at @xmath459 kpc along the north - west minor axis .",
    "eventually , we conclude that this test provides the lower limit to the radial metallicity gradient photometrically detected in the north - west minor axis halo .",
    "in this study , one of our major purposes is to clarify the general properties of the underlying , smooth halo component of m31 . as mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] , recent large - scale photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the m31 halo have revealed the existence of the metal - poor and old populations ( like a classical smooth halo in the milky way ) , which are buried in the inner complex metal - rich and young substructures ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . by the term `` smooth '' ,",
    "what we mean here is not necessarily that the component is perfectly spatially smooth , but instead that any substructures that may be present in the halo are below detectability with the current survey .",
    "the surface brightness profile as shown in   [ sec : m31sb ] is a good indicator to describe the radial extent of the halo . since many studies of the density distributions of the milky way halo have already been made , it is useful to compare such results with our current studies of the m31 halo .",
    "the milky way halo has been characterized by a steep power - law density profile @xmath460 : its power - law index , @xmath461 , is in the range of @xmath348 to @xmath462 .",
    "some of the variance in the value of @xmath461 appear among different research groups , which can be attributed to the presence of substructures in the halo ; previous studies have commonly been limited in sky coverage , so some local structures in the halo can affect a final result . surveys covering significant portions of the sky have been feasible only recently . for instance , the most recent sdss study by @xcite , which made use of good distance estimates to halo stars near main - sequence turnoff covering 6500 deg@xmath463 of sky , found @xmath464 corresponding to @xmath465 as a power - law index of the surface brightness profile .",
    "similarly , @xcite have found the stellar density distribution with @xmath466 , based on about @xmath467 color - selected main - sequence turnoff stars contained in the sdss dr5 catalog .",
    "although in these sdss surveys accurate investigations of the density profile are limited only within @xmath468 kpc ( or at most 40 kpc , relied on the quest rr lyrae sample of @xcite ) due to the uncertainty in the determination of the distance to remote stars , these results for the milky way halo are completely consistent with the present result of the m31 halo , @xmath469 ( i.e. , @xmath470 ) , as derived for the north - west minor - axis halo out to @xmath471 kpc .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare our current result of the radial profile of the m31 halo with other observational studies dedicated to the outer halo .",
    "our photometrically - estimated north - west profile is in reasonably agreement with the south - east profile of @xmath472 based on the large south quadrant area out to 140 kpc ( in projection ) from the m31 center by the photometric cfht / megacam survey of @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our result is slightly flatter than @xcite and @xcite who have found an extended stellar halo in m31 following @xmath473 ( or @xmath37 ) out to @xmath474 kpc , based on the kinematically - selected rgb sample by the keck / deimos observation .",
    "however , we note that the former authors have not removed unresolved background galaxies which significantly affect fields under the worse seeing condition as discussed in   [ sec : daopars ] and their survey is more than one magnitude shallower than our suprime - cam survey .",
    "the latter authors have estimated the radial profile of the m31 halo derived from secure spectroscopic rgb sample in the remote outer halo , but it is based on only @xmath475 red giants to determine the outer profile beyond @xmath476 kpc .",
    "recent numerical simulations predict that most of the mass in the stellar halo originates in satellites that were accreted more than 8 gyr ago ( corresponding to at @xmath477 ) .",
    "the halo is smoothly built from the inside out within the finite dynamical time scale , and becomes the dominant contributor at 3060 kpc and within @xcite .",
    "our derived surface density profile of the m31 halo in the external view is in excellently agreement with the density profile of the accreted stellar halo ; it is described as a hernquist profile with @xmath478 kpc within the radial range dominated by the ancient halo , as expected by the @xcite model . in the meantime , our nfw fitting based on the observed sb profile returns several times higher concentration value ( @xmath479 ) than that derived from the simulations based on dark matter distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming the typical virial radius ( e.g. , @xmath480 kpc ) of milky way - type galaxies .",
    "this fact suggests that the visible baryonic matter like stars may well converge in the galactic center compared to the invisible dark matter because of baryon dissipation during accretion processes .",
    "another major purpose of the current study is to probe the origin of various substructures as found in both the inner and outer parts of the m31 halo .",
    "their metallicity distributions as well as the spatial distributions of substructures are useful information to untangle the formation history of the halo because each substructure preserves such fossil records associated with star formation and merging / accretion events .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , the spatial distribution of mean / median metallicity along the south - east minor axis of the m31 halo remains approximately constant with increasing radius from the center .",
    "this is because our observing fields with suprime - cam coincidentally overlap some overdense stream - like substructures , characterized by stream  d , c and b of @xcite , which dominate the metallicity distribution of the stars in these fields .",
    "stream  d and c have similar high mean metallicity but clearly different cmd morphology and metallicity distributions as shown in   [ sec : scd ] , suggesting that these two populations are different . stream  b brushes our outermost south - east field at @xmath481 kpc , as shown in the south quadrant map of @xcite .",
    "this constancy in the mean metallicity variation is consistent with the prediction by many previous studies , proposing that the halo is built - up through the dissipationless chaotic assembly from small subgalactic fragments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , the absence of metallicity gradient conflicts with the result of @xcite and @xcite , who found a strong metallicity gradient in the south - east minor axis discrete fields out to @xmath482 kpc , based on the kinematically - selected rgb sample with the keck / deimos spectrograph .",
    "the mean metallicities in the subaru fields ( se2 and se9 ) which overlap with the two fields studied in @xcite ( their a0[30kpc ] and m6[87kpc ] ) are actually almost consistent with those given in their paper ( @xmath283[fe / h]@xmath483 ) , although their work showed a metallicity gradient over larger radii out to @xmath474 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "some discrepancies with the @xcite result are puzzling .",
    "these authors re - analyzed the same data as @xcite but using a different method for metallicity determination and found a strong metallicity gradient , where the metallicity at @xmath481 kpc is [ fe / h]@xmath484 , i.e. , more metal - poor than our result of [ fe / h]@xmath485 .",
    "although comprehensive understanding of this descrepancy is difficult only from our photometric studies , stream  b which distributes over our fields at @xmath481 kpc may affect the determination of a global metallicity distribution , as mentioned above . to settle this issue ,",
    "it is necessary to carry out a wider - field photometric / spectroscopic survey over the large outer part of the m31 halo .",
    "in addition , we compare with the main - sequence fitting results based on the _",
    "hst_/acs deep observations of @xcite who found the trend that the mean age becomes simply older beyond 30 kpc in the south - east inner region .",
    "in fact , we have found that at 27 kpc , 41 kpc ( corresponding to stream  d ) , and 57 kpc ( corresponding to stream  c ) , the mean ages are @xmath486 , @xmath487 , and @xmath488 gyr , respectively , as derived from their mds and rc magnitudes using the theoretically - computed relation of @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rejkuba ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that there exist some inhomogeneities of the halo , which is yet on the way to the equilibrium structure .",
    "the mean metallicity variation along the north - west minor axis , based on continuous suprime - cam pointings out to @xmath489 kpc , shows a strong spatial gradient with increasing radius .",
    "this is consistent with the result of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this spatial dependence of abundance distribution may conflict with the scenario of galactic halo formation via hierarchical merging , where successive merging events can erase any spatial gradients in metallicities as confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , the study of @xcite predicts a gradient in [ fe / h ] averaged over each full simulated halo of at most 0.5 dex over a few tens of kpc .",
    "it is yet difficult to clarify the physical origin of the detected metallicity gradient in the halo because there exist few observations and simulations for the presence of a strong abundance gradient with increasing radius in the halo .",
    "a possible explanation for the current result is that the observed spatial distribution of metallicities may reflect just a snapshot of the dynamical evolution , which is on the way to the equilibrium structure characterized by a flatter metallicity gradient . in particular , the halo structure",
    "is dominated by transient substructures , which may largely affect the spatial distribution of metallicities instantaneously .",
    "indeed , modern galaxy formation simulations within the context of the standard @xmath490cdm cosmology predict that the outer halo beyond @xmath491 kpc is dominated by numerous faint arcs , shells and streams , as the relaxation time of these subsystems as found at large distances from the galaxy center is quite long at such locations , where even the dynamical time is of order of gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , dynamical friction is at work , which acts more strongly on more massive subhalos , making them fall rapidly into the potential well , where they become disrupted and their contents are mixed into the evolving galaxy .",
    "we then observe a rather steep metallicity gradient just after this event occurs .",
    "satellites with sufficiently long accretion times of more than several gyr would contribute to the wide range of the stellar halo , so it is difficult to find any density substructures in such well - mixed systems at the present day . it is noteworthy that previous studies found kinematically cold substructures based on the detailed keck / deimos spectroscopic observations in the south regions of the m31 halo , where no evidence for the presence of substructures has been deduced from photometric observations @xcite .",
    "these results suggest the possibility that there are also as - yet unrelaxed debris from disrupted dwarf satellites underneath the smooth halo at the north - west 30 - 40 kpc fields .",
    "some @xmath17-body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicted that these optically faint substructures below our detected surface brightness levels may still exist in phase space , kinematics . in this",
    "regard , we discuss about the possibility of the existence of these dispersed faint substructures in this subsection .    as long as the surface brightness profiles ( fig .  [",
    "fig : m31sb ] and [ fig : m31sbfit ] ) are concerned , there is no evidence for overdense substructures in the north - west and south - east regions at 30 kpc .",
    "however , we find the age difference between both fields ; the mean age of the stellar population in the north - west part ( @xmath492 gyr ) is about 2.5 gyr younger than that in the south - east counterpart field ( @xmath493 gyr ) , as derived from their mds and rc magnitudes using the theoretically - computed relation of @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rejkuba ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can not insist that the two populations originated from the same stellar population because the ks probability for this hypothesis based on their two cumulative mds is rather low .",
    "therefore , we expect that there might be a dispersed faint substructure in the seemingly smooth regions at @xmath494 3050 kpc in the north - west minor axis halo , which preserves the information of ancient accretion events .",
    "in addition , note that the age difference could be occurred by the difference in the distance of the same population substructures . to distinguish these much fainter substructures from the smooth inner halo we need additional kinematic studies as well as some abundance information ( such as @xmath278-element abundance ) as predicted in @xcite .",
    "suppose that in the north - west region of m31 halo there exists such a well - mixed substructure with sufficient long accretion time ( e.g. , 9 gyr ) , it may be possible to trace this accretion event from our photometric data if the event provides some specific stellar populations .",
    "if so , we expect a specific magnitude of the rc / agbb feature , where a clustered distribution of stars in color - magnitude diagrams allows us to easily identify the presence of such stellar populations , compared to attempts to detect faint spatial substructures from already smeared out surface density distribution .",
    "also we can estimate the mass of an accreted satellite as @xmath495 , which corresponds to @xmath31_{\\rm mean } \\sim - 1.0}$ ] . then",
    ", if we suppose that this progenitor galaxy genuinely has an intermediate - age population , it is likely that such a galaxy possibly having interstellar gas has undergone a star formation driven by , for instance , the second or third collision or supernova wind about 7.5 gyr ago .",
    "the recent models also predict that substructures that we can discover in the remote outer halo more likely have low surface brightness compared to the inner substructures with high metallicity and high surface brightness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite predict that in a stellar halo of milky way type galaxies being built entirely from accretion within a @xmath490cdm context , the fraction of the system ( of the order of 10% of its stars ) are comprised of distinct substructures , i.e. , a few to a dozen streams which are brighter than 35 mag arcsec@xmath23 at projected distances greater than 30 kpc from the host galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : kvjf8 ] shows the same cumulative distribution derived from our m31 observations and @xcite : the gss , stream  a to f and the major - axis diffuse structure .",
    "the gray zone indicates plausible upper and lower limits , if simply extrapolated to the entire survey region .",
    "it is evident that both luminosity functions derived from the models and the observations are reasonably similar , suggesting that the outer halo of m31 as well as the milky way halo has been built up by recent accretion events of satellite galaxies .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ fig : font08 ] plots the average metallicity against sb for these substructures including our w - shelf data .",
    "gray circles show the stream  a and b substructures of @xcite . since metallicity uncertainties are just roughly plotted based on the error analysis in   [",
    "sec : metal_err ] , in practice they may be slightly larger . despite this , we find that higher sb tidal debris tend to be more metal - rich , which is confirmed by some recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result implies that higher sb debris may tend to come from the more luminous , metal - rich dwarf satellites and/or recent encounters .",
    "however , while more detailed theoretical approaches to the issue are required , it is also of great importance to explore more and fainter substructures in the larger region of the m31 halo using the next - generation wide - field imager such as hyper suprime - cam , to set tighter limits on the halo formation history .",
    "it is worth noting that recent high - resolution @xmath17-body simulation made by @xcite provides an interesting scenario for the m31 halo : a merging event of a dwarf satellite into the halo of m31 gives rise to an elongated substructure similar to the gss , the giant stellar stream found in the south - east part of m31 s halo .",
    "also , their model suggests that further stream - like substructures emerge in the form of concentric shells around a galaxy after collisions with a disk component and subsequent relaxation process , and that a multiple large - scale shell system is finally formed in the outer region of the halo ; the outermost large - scale shells have a radius of @xmath496 kpc and survive for at least 4  gyr .",
    "if this is the case , then widely - separated shell structures would appear in the form of concentric shells around m31 s halo .",
    "although with this anticipation it is difficult to understand the existence of the clearly different radial metallicity gradients found along the north and south parts of m31 , we actually have been able to identify two overdense substructures at the north - west counterpart fields .",
    "considering their cmd morphology , it appears that the counterpart of stream  e is stream  b and that of stream  f is stream  a , although there is some positional shift of about 1520 kpc .",
    "since it is not yet clear that these counterpart streams indeed have the same populations , we need to carry out further observations of the m31 halo with a wider and deeper imaging survey , in order to clarify the detailed stellar population and the true spatial extension of these substructures .",
    "we have investigated the structure and stellar populations of the stellar halo in the andromeda galaxy , using deep and wide - field @xmath29 and @xmath1-band images taken with subaru / suprime - cam . from the analysis of the cmds through comparing isochrones and globular cluster fiducials ,",
    "the fundamental properties of each halo structure identified here have been derived , such as distance , surface brightness profiles , metallicities and ages of the stellar populations .",
    "our results for each of the gss and other halo structures ( substructures and smooth halo ) are summarized as follows .",
    "we have identified an intermediate - age and metal - rich rc population as well as a broad rgb sequence in the andromeda gss . from the @xmath0 cmd and the lf ,",
    "we have measured the distance to our observed stream field of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 kpc ) based on the @xmath1-magnitude of the trgb and reddening @xmath497 .",
    "this result supports the previous prediction of @xcite that their field  5 ( @xmath498 kpc ) which falls near gss1 is at about 100 kpc further away along the line of sight relative to m31 s main body .    from the photometric comparison of more than 7000 bright rgb stars in our stream field with the rgb templates of galactic globular clusters ,",
    "we have obtained the metallicity ditributions ( mds ) of the gss for a statistically significant sample .",
    "it shows the characteristics summarized as the peak metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath499 , the average metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath500 and the median metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath501 .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with that of kinematically selected rgb stars in the same stream field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , based on the stellar mass / luminosity - metallicity relation observed for the local group dwarf galaxies shown in @xcite and @xcite , the mass of the plausible progenitor is in the range of @xmath9 to @xmath10 , which is consistent with the work of @xcite .",
    "the feature near rc , showing an extended brighter part relative to its peak , is an unambiguous signature of an intermediate age population , which is also supported by the existence of an agb bump .",
    "we have estimated the age of the stellar population in the gss , by convolving the mds and the rc magnitudes with the theoretical models from @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have found that the dominated population of the gss has the mean age of @xmath8 gyr , consistent with the main - sequence fitting results with the _",
    "hst_/acs observations by @xcite .",
    "the gss possibly originated from the accretion or minor merger of a massive dwarf satellite within the mass range of @xmath9 to @xmath502 , like m32 , but previous studies suggests that m32 itself is probably not a progenitor of the gss , as we already mentioned in section  1 .",
    "considering the finite dynamical time of such a mass accretion , the progenitor has to be bound to m31 several billion years ago as judged from the current residual substructure .",
    "the first pericentric merging may well induce the third star forming event from the remaining gas , whereas 30% of the gss stars were provided in this event .        * in the outer halo beyond @xmath4 kpc , m31 contains a multitude of overdense substructures compared to the smooth radial profile , such as streams , arc and shells .",
    "we confirm the two substructures , namely stream  c and d , discovered by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from our constructed stellar density maps we have found two as - yet unknown overdense substructures in the north - west halo , which we call stream  e and f in this work .",
    "it is yet unclear to what extent these substructures are spatially distributed .",

    "this result implies that higher sb debris may tend to come from the more luminous , metal - rich dwarf satellites and/or recent encounters .",
    "* by separating regions showing obvious substructures , we have found that the remaining area of the survey exhibits a smooth metal - poor stellar halo component in the north - west minor axis halo .",
    "this structure needs not to be perfectly spatially smooth , but the intrinsic inhomogeneities are below the sensitivity of this study .",
    "the smooth halo is vast , extending out to the radial limit of the survey , at @xmath503 kpc .",
    "the sb profile of this component can be modeled with a hernquist profile as suggested by simulations , and the resulting scale radius of @xmath15 kpc is comparable to what modern halo formation simulations predict .",

    "our nfw fitting based on the observed sb profile returns a several times higher concentration value than that derived from the simulations based on dark matter distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* we have detected metallicity inhomogeneities in different radial directions .",
    "the spatial distribution of mean metallicity along the south - east minor axis of the m31 halo remains approximately constant , while that along the north - west minor axis shows a strong spatial gradient with @xmath49 out to 100 kpc .",
    "this fact suggests that the halo may be yet in the course of the dynamical evolution , leading subsequently to a flatter metallicity gradient .    in conclusion , the outer halo of the andromeda galaxy as well as that of the milky way can be formed from distinct stellar substructures deposited from over @xmath506 independent accretion events of subhalos with masses similar to typical dwarf galaxies , i.e. , of order @xmath9@xmath502 .",

    "<S> we present a photometric survey of the stellar halo of the nearest giant spiral galaxy , andromeda ( m31 ) , using suprime - cam on the subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of @xmath0 color - magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar population is used to measure properties such as line - of - sight distance , surface brightness , metallicity , and age , and these are used to isolate and characterize different components of the m31 halo : ( 1 ) the giant southern stream ( gss ) , ( 2 ) several other substructures , and ( 3 ) the smooth halo . </S>",
    "<S> first , the gss is characterized by a broad red giant branch ( rgb ) and a metal - rich / intermediate - age red clump ( rc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-magnitude of the well - defined tip of the rgb suggests the distance to the observed gss field of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 kpc ) at a projected radius of @xmath4 kpc from m31 s center . </S>",
    "<S> the gss shows a high metallicity peaked at [ fe / h]@xmath5 with a mean ( median ) of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , estimated via comparison with theoretical isochrones . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the luminosity of the rc , we estimate the mean age of its stellar population to be @xmath8 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of its progenitor galaxy is likely in the range of @xmath9 to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we study m31 s halo substructure along the north - west / south - east minor axis out to @xmath11 kpc and the south - west major axis region at @xmath12 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm two substructures in the south - east halo reported by ibata et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2007 ) and discover two overdense substructures in the north - west halo . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the properties of these four substructures as well as other structures including the western shelf and find that differences in stellar populations among these systems , thereby suggesting each has a different origin . </S>",
    "<S> our statistical analysis implies that the m31 halo as a whole may contain at least 16 substructures , each with a different origin , so its outer halo has experienced at least this many accretion events involving dwarf satellites with mass @xmath9@xmath10 since a redshift of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> third , we investigate the properties of an underlying , smooth and extended halo component out to @xmath14 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the surface density of this smooth halo can be fitted to a hernquist model of scale radius @xmath15 kpc or a power - law profile with @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo density profile , its metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non - uniform with non - monotonic variations with radius , suggesting that the halo population has not had sufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations . </S>",
    "<S> further implications for the formation of the m31 halo are discussed . </S>"
