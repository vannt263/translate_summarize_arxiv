    "einstein field equation leads to the solutions satisfying the definition of a perfect fluid , a homogenous isotropic mass and energy distribution with no viscosity , such as friedmann - lematre models ( for a good review see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it also provides the chance to investigate the interior distributions of the perfect fluid through energy - momentum tensor ; not to forget that the energy - momentum tensor can actually be extracted from charged bodies bearing interior pressure .",
    "a relativistic star is supposed to consist of such a fluid either charged or with axial rotation @xcite . in order to find out the relativistic , isotropic mass and charge the interior solution has been suggested by b. guilfoyl @xcite .    in this article , we are about to form a static charged relativistic star using these so - called solutions ; besides , studying the dynamical properties of the exterior geometry via a rotating test - particle is included .    as it goes without saying , in general relativity geodesics motions are of great importance . since",
    ", it makes precious anticipations about the cases such as precessions of periastron in planetary orbits and theoretical explanations for light deflection in gravitational fields .",
    "furthermore , there are lots of researches which have been dedicated to the study of geodesic motions in different kinds of geometrical background , which could be derived from general relativity , for example , schwarzchild , schwarzchild - de sitter , reissner - nordstrm and kerr geometries ( see @xcite-@xcite and an important text book @xcite ) . the exact equations of motion have been also derived @xcite , and lots of further theoretical predictions provided ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "in this case we are considering reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) geometry as the exterior geometry of a static charged relativistic star .",
    "the procedure that we are going through in this paper concerns the process in which charged particles get trapped in gravitational and electrical fields of relativistic stars .",
    "the chosen approach is a lagrangian formalism and numerical simulations also have been involved . in order to do so",
    ", three classes of solutions presented by guilfoyl have been utilized to construct a relativistic star and to compare the pertinent geodesic behaviors of the test charged particle .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section two contains dynamical preliminaries for a charged particle in rn geometry , section three considers a brief review on guilfoyl s interior solutions . in section four",
    ", we introduce the lagrangian formalism . finally",
    ", sections five and six , consist of the simulations of charged particle s motions on various types of relativistic stars .",
    "first , let us consider a spherical source which has been schematically illustrated in figure [ star-1 ] . it indicates the charged star , considered to be the gravitational source , with @xmath1 being the radius , and the total mass and charge being @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "a test - particle which is moving on this star , is assumed to travel on the    rn geodesics .",
    "the rn geometry is a static spherically symmetric vacuum solution for the einstein equations in for dimensions ( @xmath4 ) and is defined by the metric : @xmath5    in which the variable coefficients are : @xmath6    where @xmath7 stands for the gravitational constant and @xmath8 for the speed of light . in order to simplify the calculations",
    ", we use geometrical units , fixing : @xmath9    according to these units , one can relate length dimensions to quantities like mass and electric charge , i.e. ( see @xcite appendix 4 ) : @xmath10 = [ m_0 ] = \\ell,\\ ] ] @xmath11 = [ q_0 ] = \\ell,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 notates the length dimension . since @xmath8 and @xmath7 are supposed to be 1 , the remaining ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14 , become dimensionless .",
    "these assumptions are commonly used in general relativity . taking these into account",
    ", one can rewrite ( [ pre - rn-1 ] ) as : @xmath15 we will use this metric in further considerations .",
    "if we write the killing equations for killing vector @xmath16 , as @xcite : @xmath17",
    "one can obtain 10 killing vectors for the spacetime defined by metric ( [ rn-1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , since for the rn spacetime we have @xmath4 , the number of killing vectors would be @xmath18 .",
    "due to this fact , the rn spacetime has killing symmetry and we can define energy and obtain time - like geodesics .    by considering the characteristics of the test - particle ( @xmath19 stands for the mass and @xmath20 for the charge )",

    "the metric components @xmath25 can be derived from the exterior geometry of the source , the rn metric ( [ rn-1 ] ) .",

    "the motion of the particle , depends on its energy , for sets of solutions for @xmath43 .",
    "the rn spacetime allows three types of orbits ; for one zero , we will have scape orbits , for two zeros , periodic bound orbits are available , and for three zeros , we will have scape / capture orbits and periodic bound orbits .",

    "in this article , a relativistic star , is defined to be a charged spherically symmetric cold perfect fluid .",

    "this star ( figure [ boundary condition ] ) is not the one that will be used as the massive source for the test particle to move on .",
    "it is only used for discussing the interior solutions and it is in fact , a boundary condition to derive the desired constants in the interior solutions .",
    "however , the massive source in figure [ star-1 ] has the same distributions but in lower dimensions .",
