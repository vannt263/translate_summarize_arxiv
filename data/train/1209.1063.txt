    "in recent years gete thin films doped with @xmath0 transition metals have received considerable attention from experimentalists interested in the field of magnetic semiconductors@xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic order was observed for the cr , mn , and fe doped films , whereas ti , v , co and ni doped films were found to be paramagnetic@xcite .",
    "the curie temperatures @xmath1 of these thin films have been found to depend on the type and concentration of the dopants , with a high value of 140 k , reported for ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te for @xmath4=0.51@xcite .",
    "later on this group of researchers reported even higher value of @xmath5 190 k in dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) ge@xmath6mn@xmath7te@xcite .",
    "@xmath1s around 200 - 250 k have been reported by fukuma @xcite for ge@xmath2cr@xmath3te thin films for low values of @xmath4 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the thin films in all these studies were of predominantly rock salt structure .",
    "for spintronic applications , the desired properties of such ferromagnets are half - metallicity and relatively high curie temperatures .",
    "possibility of half - metallicity in cr- and v - substituted gete bulk compounds has been reported by zhao @xcite , based on theoretical calculations using linear augmented plane waves ( lapw ) wien2k code for some ordered ge - v - te and ge - cr - te compounds .",
    "these authors left the issue of the curie temperature unattended , as only the electronic band structure , density of states and charge density were studied , and not the exchange interaction in these compounds . a theoretical study of the electronic structure of ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te , based on the generalized gradient approximation plus hubbard u ( gga+u ) , has been presented by ciucivara@xcite among the magnetic properties only the magnetic moment was considered , the issue of the exchange interaction and @xmath1 was not addressed . recently a large number of experimental studies related to magnetism and magnetic transitions in several ge - te based alloys , such as ge - cr - te , ge - mn - te and ge - fe - te ) have been reported .",
    "@xcite in addition , there is substantial amount work on dmss in general ( for a review see [ ] ) , where the magnetic properties arise via percolation effects among a very small concentration of the magnetic atoms . for a discussion on magnetic percolation in dmss readers may consult the work by bergqvist @xcite    in view of the large body of existing experimental work as mentioned above , we have embarked on a systematic theoretical study of the gete system doped with @xmath0 transition metal atoms .",
    "the most commonly occurring structure for both bulk and thin films of these compounds is the nacl or the rock - salt ( rs ) structure .",
    "however , from the theoretical viewpoint an equally interesting structure to study is the zinc blende ( zb ) structure . both rs and zb are fcc - based , but differ in terms of the distance between the ge and te atoms . thus irrespective of whether one dopes the te- or the ge - sublattice with a magnetic ( @xmath0 ) atom ,",
    "the magnetic effects are expected to differ because of different levels of hybridization between the @xmath0 orbitals and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbitals of the ge or te atoms .",
    "experimentally it may be possible to grow both rs and zb structures , even though the ground state structure appears to be rs .",
    "thus we have studied the electronic and magnetic properties of both these structures for different concentrations of the magnetic v , cr , and mn atoms .",
    "we have employed supercell method as well as the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to study the effect of doping at various concentrations .",
    "the supercell calculations are carried out using the full potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method using the wien2k code@xcite .",
    "the cpa calculations are carried out within the frame - work of the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method using the atomic sphere approximation ( asa)@xcite . in a limited number of cases , when the half - metallicity is predicted on the basis of both supercell and cpa calculations , we have provided results for exchange interactions and curie temperatures for these alloys .",
    "the crystal structures of the ternary gete based compounds ge@xmath2tm@xmath3te ( tm stands for transition metal atoms v , cr and mn ) were constructed from the unit cell of rs and zb structures as follows .",
    "the doping levels of x=0.25 or 0.75 were achieved by replacing the ge atoms at the vertex site or face - center sites , respectively , of the rs / zb unit cell , with the tm atoms . both cases ( x=0.25 or 0.75 )",
    "have the same space group ( @xmath11 , or 221 ) for the rs structure , and ( @xmath12 , or 215 ) for zb .",
    "the x=0.5 doping is obtained by replacing the ge atoms at the four compatible face - center sites . in this way",
    "we generate tetragonal structure ( @xmath13 , 115 ) for the zb case and ( @xmath14 , 123 ) for rs .",
    "this procedure of realizing the doping levels results in minimal primitive cells , with the highest possible symmetry .",
    "numerous semiconductors are known to crystallize in the zb or rs structures .",
    "as such these ternary compounds should be compatible with a large number of semiconductors .",
    "calculations were carried out within the framework of the density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite , using the wien@xmath15k@xcite code based on the full - potential linear augmented plane wave plus local orbitals method .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) proposed by perdew was used for exchange and correlation potentials@xcite .",
    "we consider full relativistic effects for the core states and use the scalar - relativistic approximation for the valence states , neglecting the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the latter is known to produce only a small effect on the results that are of interest in this work , e.g. , density of states and the energy gaps .    as a note to practitioners of this code",
    ", we used @xmath16 k points ( monkhorst - park grid@xcite ) for the brillouin - zone integration , set @xmath17 and carried out the angular momentum expansion up to @xmath18 in the muffin tins , and used @xmath19 for the charge density .",
    "all core and valence states are treated self - consistently .",
    "convergence with respect to basis set and k - point sampling was carefully verified . the self - consistent calculation is allowed to stop only when the integrated charge difference per formula unit , @xmath20 , for the input and output charge densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 is less than @xmath23 . in the calculation of ge - x - te in different structures ,",
    "the muffin - tin ( mt ) radii are chosen to be @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 a.u . for ge , x",
    "( x = v , cr , mn ) and te atoms , respectively .",
    "for each case equilibrium lattice parameter was obtained by minimizing the total energy with respect to the cell volume .",
    "all electronic properties such as the density of states ( dos ) , energy bands and magnetic moments were then calculated for the equilibrium lattice parameters . among all the ternary tm compounds with",
    "the doping levels considered , we find 9 half - metallic ( hm ) cases : one mn - doped , three cr - doped , and three v - doped cases for the rs structure ; and one cr - doped and one v - doped cases for the zb structure ( see tables i - iv ) . there is a small drop in the value of the equilibrium lattice parameter with increasing dopant concentration in all cases .",
    "this is supported by the measurements of lattice parameters for the thin films of ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te and ge@xmath2cr@xmath3te grown in rs structure @xcite .",
    "bulk moduli , calculated by using birch - murnaghan equation of state @xcite , are found to increase with the doping level for v- and cr - doping . for mn - doping",
    "this change is non - monotonic .",
    "the equilibrium lattice constants , x - te bond lengths , and bulk moduli , magnetic moments , minority - spin gaps , and half - metallic gaps for the ternary compounds in rs structure are summarized in tables i and ii .",
    "the same quantities for the ternary compounds in zb structure are summarized in tables iii and iv . in general , the band gap tends to increase with decreasing lattice parameter .",
    "this is understandable as the increased hybridization due to decreasing inter - atomic distances leads to increased separation between the energies of the bonding and anti - bonding states .",

    "what is certain is that the ground state is not fm , with @xmath37 being a minimum at the @xmath38-point .",
    "thus the ground state for zb ge@xmath36mn@xmath35te may involve a complex magnetic structure or the substance may enter a spin - glass state at low temperatures . in order to ensure that our results do not suffer from a convergence problem",
    ", we have looked at the @xmath37 values as a function of increasing shells of neighbors .",
    "the results for zb ge@xmath36mn@xmath35te with fm reference state are shown in section ( c ) of fig.[f9 ] .",
    "results for 10 shells of neighbor are indistinguishable from those for 63 shells considered in all our calculations , indicating that our results are well - converged .",
    "experimentally , ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te alloys , with x = cr , mn , fe have been reported to exhibit ferromagnetic behavior @xcite over wide range of the concentration @xmath4 .",
    "the structure of these compounds , grown as thin films , is usually found to be rs or small deviations from this . for ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te the structure",
    "is found to be rhombohedrally distorted nacl for small mn concentrations , with the distortion vanishing for @xmath39@xcite",
    ". these studies also report presence of carriers in the samples , with transport measurements most often indicating p - type carriers @xcite , independent of temperature .",
    "fukuma and co - workers identify the carriers as holes @xcite . depending on carrier concentration , brought about by varying mn concentration or hydrostatic pressure ,",
    "t@xmath40 may vary non - monotonically@xcite .",
    "highest reported t@xmath40 is around 130 - 140 k for mn concentration @xmath4 slightly over 50% in the ge - mn sublattice , and for @xmath41 t@xmath40 is @xmath42 70 k @xcite .",

    "note that the lattice parameters reported for @xmath43 and 0.55 in ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te are 5.939 and 5.895  , respectively , which compare well with our calculated values 5.964 and 5.914  , for @xmath41 and 0.50 , respectively ( table [ i ] ) .",

    ". solid lines in ( a ) and ( c ) represent the results for the equilibrium lattice parameter .",
    ", width=264 ]    our zero temperature results indicate that exactly at the concentration @xmath4=0.25 , ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te should be either a semiconductor with small gap or at best a zero gap semiconductor , in both rs and zb structures .",
    "the magnetic structure of the ground state in this case is not fm , it is either afm or more complex . at finite temperatures , free carriers in the conduction band and holes in the valence band",
    "are expected and the number of such carriers may be significant in view of the fact that the gap is close to zero .",
    "however , it is believed that there are also a large number of carriers , mainly holes , with temperature - independent concentration@xcite .",
    "rs gete is reported to be a narrow gap semiconductor with a band gap of about 0.2 ev@xcite .",
    "its very high @xmath10-type conduction is ascribed to large cation ( ge ) vacancies@xcite , which seem to dominate over transport due to thermally excited carriers .",
    "we have thus decided to explore this issue , in the framework of our zero temperature formalism , in several ways .",
    "guided by the fact that experiments indicate presence of uncompensated carriers , with temperature - independent concentrations , we first explore the effects of such carriers using the simplest possible approach .",
    "the easiest thing for us is to find the change in mn - mn exchange interaction by moving the fermi energy up ( simulating holes ) or down ( simulating electrons ) .",
    "this is a one step non - self - consistent ( frozen potential ) calculation , in the spirit of the rigid band model .",
    "after self - consistency has been achieved for the equilibrium lattice parameter , exchange interactions are calculated for the self - consistent potential and the correct fermi energy , and then also for the same potential but assuming the fermi energy to be slightly higher / lower to simulate holes / electrons .",
    "the fermi energy coming out from the self - consistent calculation for the equilibrium lattice parameter is simply moved up or down by 0.136/0.68 ev ( 0.01/0.05 ry ) . in fig.[f12 ] we show this change for both zb and rs structure ge@xmath36mn@xmath35te and @xmath44 ev ( 0.05 ry ) . in both cases , i.e. fermi energy changed by @xmath450.68",
    "ev , there is an increase in the mn - mn interaction . in fig.[f13 ] we compare the results of changing he fermi energy by 0.136 ev and 0.68 ev in rs ge@xmath36mn@xmath35te for two different lattice parameters .",
    "this indicates that both electron- and hole - doping of the system would be an efficient way to drive it toward ferromagnetism .",
    "of course , hole- and electron - doping can be simulated in other ways as well , for example , by changing the effective valence of the atoms .",
    "this can be done by changing the valence of the magnetic or the nonmagnetic atoms . in fig.[f13a ] we show the effect of altering the valence of mn atoms from 7 to 6.8 , 6.9 and 7.1 for different lattice parameters .",
    "this is equivalent to studying the effect of alloying of mn with other elements to the left or right in the same row of the periodic table using virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) .",
    "these calculations are self - consistent , as opposed to the above results with rigidly shifted fermi levels , but may suffer from the weaknesses of vca .",
    "we have also included the case where mn concentration in the ge - sublattice is reduced from 25% to 22% and the remaining 3% of the sites on this sublattice are left vacant . in all these calculations",
    "it is the magnetic atom mn , whose concentration is effectively altered to create the electrons or holes .",
    "next , we explore the effect of creating holes or electrons by keeping the concentration of mn atoms fixed at 25% .",

    "we have examined theoretically the possibility of half - metallic ferromagnetism in bulk ge@xmath2tm@xmath3te alloys , with tm being the transition metals v , cr and mn .",
    "fp - lapw calculations reveal the possibility of half - metallicity for some of the ordered alloys . for these cases",
    "we have calculated the exchange interactions and the curie temperatures .",
    "the later calculations apply to cases where the ge and the tm atoms occupy randomly the ge - sublattice .",
    "the effect of this disorder is taken into account using the cpa .",
    "ferromagnetic interactions are strongest in the cr - doped zb gete .",
    "the cr - doping case is most promising , as in both rs and zb structures fm interactions dominate , and these remain fm with changes in the lattice parameter .",
    "the next promising case is v - doping in the zb structure , the rs counterpart showing strong antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions , particularly at and around the equilibrium lattice parameter .",
    "these afm interactions weaken on both sides of the equilibrium lattice parameter value and become fm only at much higher volume . our calculations for tm = mn and",
    "@xmath4=0.25 shows the substance to be afm ( for the ordered as well as disordered compounds , with the gap being narrower in the disordered case ) .",
    "we show that this afm behavior is linked to the substance being a narrow / zero gap semiconductor / semimetal at this mn concentration .",
    "we further establish that the presence of uncompensated carriers should drive the material toward ferromagnetism .",
    "the origin of these carriers could be vacancies , impurity atoms , and/or structural imperfections .",
    "in fact both ge - te and ge@xmath2tm@xmath3te samples are known to have large number of holes ( @xmath10-type carriers ) due to cation(ge ) vacancies@xcite .",
    "a comparison of the results in figs .",
    "[ f14 ] and [ f15 ] clearly shows that holes in the ge - mn sublattice is much more effective in driving the system to ferromagnetism than the holes in te - sublattice .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the experimental observation that all ferromagnetic films of ge@xmath2tm@xmath3te have a large number of temperature - independent p - type carriers , associated with vacancies in the ge sublattice .",
    "the calculated exchange interactions due to carriers originating from these causes are sufficient to account for the observed ferromagnetism in thin films of ge@xmath2mn@xmath3te .",
    "our results for the exchange interactions are consistent with experiments in that the highest t@xmath40 reported so far seem to be for thin films of ge@xmath2cr@xmath3te .",
    "some differences between our calculated results and the experiments could be ascribed to the fact that our calculations are for bulk alloys , while experimental results are mostly for thin films .",
    "for example , distortions with respect to the bulk structures may be present in thin films , in addition to the fact that the lattice parameters of the thin films are usually larger than their bulk counterparts.@xcite    mn@xmath35te@xmath3z@xmath2 , where z stands for sn - atoms or vacancies .",
