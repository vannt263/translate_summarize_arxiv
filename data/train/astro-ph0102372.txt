    "the lack of homogeneity of the matter distribution on small scales , produces local departures of the hubble flow , inducing streaming motions of galaxies into the direction of larger concentrations of matter like clusters of galaxies or filaments .",
    "the determination of the amplitude of peculiar velocities is important , since it is dependent on the cosmological matter density parameter , @xmath17 .",
    "thus , there is a possibility to constrain the value of @xmath17 using the non - hubble component of galaxy motions .",
    "a characterization of this peculiar velocity field can be obtained by measuring the apparent distortion of the clustering pattern in the two - point correlation function for galaxies in redshift space , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath18 are the separations perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight , respectively .",
    "the anisotropy of the correlation function in redshift space depends on the peculiar velocity distribution function . on non - linear scales virialized regions dominate , inducing the well known `` finger of god '' effect , seen in redshift surveys allowing for estimates of the galaxy one - dimensional pairwise rms velocity dispersion @xmath19 ( @xcite ) . on larger scales , where the linear regime applies ,",
    "velocities are dominated by the infall into overdense regions as bulk motion of galaxies are generated by new levels of clustering .",
    "this effect results in a compression of the @xmath20 contours along the line of sight direction ( @xmath18 ) , and allows estimates of the parameter @xmath21 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath22 is the linear bias parameter",
    ". extensive studies of @xmath0 for galaxies have been carried out ( see for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the results of the different galaxy surveys are consistent with a one - dimensional pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath23 , and parameter @xmath24 .",
    "to examine larger volumes , clusters and groups of galaxies can be used as suitable tracers of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "several works have characterized the clustering properties of rich clusters of galaxies ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) concluding that the cluster autocorrelation function has a similar shape to that of galaxies , only with a larger amplitude .",
    "an analogous conclusion was also obtained for groups of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . due to the fact that the amplitude of the correlation function of galaxy systems is significantly larger than that",
    "corresponding to galaxies , it is expected a more significant contribution by the mean streaming velocity term . by contrast , galaxies with similar peculiar velocities would appear strongly distorted along the line of sight due to their smaller correlation amplitude .",
    "small scales effects , such as galaxy velocity bias and strongly non - linear regimes would not be present in the analysis of groups which could provide a more suitable estimate of the mean relative motions at intermediate and large scales .",
    "the subject of this paper is about redshift space distortions of galaxies and groups of galaxies .",
    "we study a sample of galaxies obtained from the updated zwicky catalog ( uzc , @xcite ) and groups of galaxies ( guzc ) obtained from this catalog using a friends - of - friends algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of these samples are briefly described in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we estimate the pairwise characteristic velocity for groups applying a minimum @xmath25 analysis to the parameters of the exponential velocity distribution model .",
    "we also estimate the @xmath13 parameter . for comparison , we repeat the calculations for the galaxy parent catalog and compare our results with estimates from other works . in section 4 ,",
    "we test the adequacy of the methods applied to estimate @xmath26 and @xmath27 using mock catalogs taken from numerical simulations corresponding to the empirical power spectrum ( peacock 1997 ) which reproduces the global properties of galaxy clustering .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the sample of galaxies was drawn from the uzc , containing 19,369 objects with apparent zwicky magnitudes @xmath28 and with 96% completeness in redshift .",
    "the region covered by the catalogue is @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 , providing accurate coordinates within 2@xmath32 and reliable redshifts in the range @xmath33 km s@xmath34 with a reasonably complete sky coverage ( see @xcite for more details ) . for our statistical purposes ,",
    "we have considered galaxies with galactic latitudes @xmath35 to avoid galactic obscuration . moreover , given the strong density gradient beyond @xmath36 km s@xmath34 we adopted this limit in @xmath37 .",
    "the algorithm adopted by @xcite for the construction of the catalog of groups of galaxies is basically the one described by @xcite with the improvements by @xcite and by @xcite in order to minimize the number of interlopers .",
    "the groups present a surrounding density contrast ( @xmath38 ) , relative to the mean density of galaxies of 80 .",
    "the uzc group catalog ( guzc ) contains systems with at least 4 members and mean radial velocities , @xmath39 15,000 consistent with the galaxy catalog . from the guzc catalog we have considered groups with the same restrictions in galactic latitude and declination than those of the galaxy catalog ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "very rich groups containing more than 40 galaxies were not considered ( only 6 groups ) in the sample to avoid few nearby large clusters and structures possibly related to systematics in the identification procedure biasing towards large percolating structures .",
    "in addition to the above criteria , those groups with @xmath42 2,000 were also discarded , to prevent any significant contribution of the group peculiar velocities in the measured redshifts which were used to determine their distances . with all the restrictions applied ,",
    "the final sample is made up of 513 groups .",
    "we analyze the effects of the peculiar velocity field on the correlation function of groups and galaxies as a function of the separations @xmath1 and @xmath18 . to compute @xmath43",
    "we generate a random catalog with the same angular limits and radial selection function than the sample of objects .",
    "we cross correlate data - data and random - random pairs ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively ) binning them as a function of separation in the two variables @xmath1 and @xmath18 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath0 is ( davis & peebles 1983 ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the number of data and random points respectively .",
    "this estimator is sensitive to uncertainties in the mean density compared to more stable estimators ( eg .",
    "hamilton 1993 ) .",
    "however , since our analysis is confined to the most inner scales where the correlation function has a large amplitude , there is not a real need to use these alternatives .",
    "the random catalog has 400 times more objects than the data sample to minimize fluctuations . to calculate @xmath0 for galaxies",
    "we have adopted the same cuts in radial velocity and galactic latitude than for the sample of groups to make the results more comparable . within these restrictions ,",
    "the final sample of galaxies comprises 14,755 objects .    in figure 1",
    "are displayed the levels of equal amplitude of the 2-point correlation function of groups ( panel a ) and galaxies ( panel b ) in the coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath18 .",
    "it can be appreciated the compression of the groups iso - correlation curves in the @xmath18 direction which indicates the lack of high pairwise velocities in the sample of these systems of galaxies . from the comparison with clusters derived from surveys in two dimensions it is clear the existence of either large pairwise velocities or large projection biases as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the presence of such projection biases in cluster samples derived in two dimensions has also been pointed out by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the sample of groups analyzed in this paper is derived from a nearly complete spectroscopic survey , so that we would not expect the artificial strong elongation along the line of sight observed in samples of clusters identified in two dimensions .",
    "this elongation would be originated by the systematic presence of groups along the line of sight in the fields of 2-dim clusters . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "such strong elongations along the line of sight are not expected in a hierarchical scenario of structure formation .",
    "this is confirmed by the compression observed in panel ( a ) and provides a clear evidence for the infall of groups onto larger structures .",
    "the level contours are well defined in the non - linear and mildly - linear regime @xmath49 .",
    "the analysis developed in the next sections will therefore consider these level contours . due to the larger velocities of galaxies and their smaller correlation amplitude ,",
    "it can be seen in panel ( b ) of this figure a large distortion of the iso - correlation curves in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the large relative peculiar velocities associated to the non - linear regime at small galaxy separations .      in order to characterize the pairwise velocities of galaxies and groups in uzc from the correlation redshift - space distortion map ,",
    "we have used two different procedures .",
    "the first method corresponds to that adopted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compare the observed correlation function @xmath0 with the convolution of the real - space correlation function with the pairwise velocity distribution function @xmath51 ( @xcite )    @xmath52f[w'+h_0 \\beta \\xi(r )                    ( 1+\\xi(r))^{-1 } r']dw ' \\label{pred}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the hubble constant , @xmath55 ( the prime denotes the line - of - sight component of a vector quantity ) and @xmath56 is the mean streaming velocity of galaxies at separation @xmath57",
    ". we have calculated the best - fit rms peculiar velocity @xmath19 for an exponential distribution ,    @xmath58    we adopted this pairwise velocity distribution because it has proved to be the most accurate fit to the results from numerical simulations as it has been shown by @xcite .",
    "we use a power - law model for @xmath59 with an index @xmath5 derived from the correlation function in projected separation @xmath6 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 corresponds to the power law fit of the projected two - point correlation function .",
    "the projected correlations for groups and galaxies and the corresponding power - law fits ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 for groups and galaxies respectively ) , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath19 for this distribution was calculated for fixed @xmath1 bins by minimizing the quantity @xmath25 ,    @xmath64 ^ 2\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 is the observed redshift space correlation function , and @xmath66 is the predicted correlation function from equation [ pred ] .",
    "the values of @xmath25 were calculated for different @xmath7 and @xmath19 , and its minimum indicates the best pair of values @xmath7 and @xmath19 .",
    "the errors were obtained repeating the previous @xmath25 procedure for 50 bootstrap resamplings .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath19 for groups and galaxies are shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the minimum @xmath25 values are @xmath67 and @xmath68 for groups and galaxies respectively .    the second method adopted to characterize the pairwise velocity field compares the predicted and observed contours of constant correlation function .",
    "we consider 5 levels of constant correlation : @xmath43=@xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we describe the equal - correlation contours in polar coordinates @xmath57 and @xmath74 and we find the best fitting values of @xmath7 and @xmath19 that minimize the quantity @xmath25 by summation over the @xmath74 bins    @xmath75 ^ 2\\ ] ]    where indexes @xmath76 and @xmath77 refer to the observed and predicted radial coordinates of the correlation function contour levels , respectively .",
    "the standard deviation is again obtained from the dispersion of the distribution of best @xmath7-@xmath19 pairs for 50 bootstrap resamplings of the groups .",
    "the results for groups and galaxies are shown in table 3 .",
    "as it can be seen by inspection to this table , this second method gives more stable determinations of @xmath19 ( minimum @xmath25 values @xmath2 and @xmath78 for groups and galaxies respectively ) .",
    "we note that the resulting value of @xmath19 for galaxies , is a factor @xmath79 higher than that of groups due to the high relative velocities of close pairs of galaxies .",
    "@xcite estimate the 1-dimensional peculiar velocity dispersion for a sample of nearby abell clusters @xmath80",
    ". this value can be compared with our estimates of @xmath19 that imply @xmath81 , considering the limiting case @xmath82 for statistically independent pairwise peculiar velocities .",
    "we notice that neither method 1 nor method 2 provide a suitable constrain to the real space correlation length @xmath7 . in the next subsection",
    "we will estimate @xmath7 considering the projected correlation function , and use these values to infer the @xmath13 parameter using the linear theory approximation .      in the linear regime ,",
    "the direction - averaged redshift space correlation function , @xmath83 , and the real space correlation function , @xmath59 , are related by ( @xcite )    @xmath84    we computed the redshift - space correlation functions for galaxies and groups , which are shown in figure 3 for groups represented by a solid line and galaxies ( dashed line ) .",
    "it can be seen from the inspection of this figure that both correlation functions can be well approximated by a power - law fit over a large range of separations .",
    "we define the projected 2-point correlation function , @xmath85 , by    @xmath86    the real - space correlation function @xmath59 of groups and galaxies show larger negative slope values than @xmath83 . for groups we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath88 ; and for galaxies @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the difference between the two slopes is larger for galaxies than for groups due to their higher pairwise velocity dispersion .    to derive @xmath7 we use the definition of the beta function in equation [ proy ] , which gives    @xmath91 \\label{r0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is the gamma function and @xmath93",
    "is assumed ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore find @xmath7 for different @xmath1 bins , and using equation [ beta ] we obtain the values of @xmath13 . in order to estimate the rms uncertainty in @xmath13 , we estimate this parameter for 50 bootstrap resamplings to compute the dispersion around the mean .",
    "the results are shown in figures 4 and 5 .",

    "it can be seen in figure 4 , the large scatter around the mean values for groups ( panel a ) and galaxies ( panel b ) . from a minimum @xmath25 analysis of the data points shown in both panels of figure 4 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath9 @xmath10 mpc and @xmath12 @xmath10 mpc for @xmath94 $ ] @xmath10 mpc , are suitable estimates of the correlation length of groups and galaxies respectively .",
    "the relative bias between optical galaxies and uzc groups can be derived from the real - space 2-point correlation functions .",
    "considering @xmath95 @xmath10 mpc , @xmath96 ( @xcite , this work ) , and our estimates for groups , @xmath97 @xmath10 mpc , @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 .    in figure 5",
    "we show the resulting @xmath13 parameter computed using equation [ beta ] for uzc groups ( panel a ) , and for galaxies ( panel b ) .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath13 are obtained from propagation of errors by means of the standard deviation in @xmath7 .",

    "the best @xmath13 value for galaxies ( @xmath102 ) is consistent with recent estimates from different surveys ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "to test the reliability of the results obtained in the previous sections we have applied our statistical methods to mock catalogs extracted from n - body simulations .",
    "the adopted model corresponds to the empirical power spectrum derived by @xcite from the observed clustering of galaxies corresponding to a flat universe with matter density parameter @xmath103 , cosmological constant density @xmath104 and a hubble constant of @xmath105 km / s mpc@xmath34 .",
    "we use @xmath106 particles in a simulated box of @xmath107 @xmath10 mpc on a side normalized to @xmath108 .",
    "the mass per particle is @xmath109 so that in the following we will associate one galaxy to each particle . from this box",
    "we extract a mock catalog of 51540 particles with the same radial selection function than uzc and @xmath110 times the area of the sky covered by uzc .",
    "we have also identified 1039 groups in the mock catalog with masses in the same range of virial masses than in the observations using an equivalent procedure to that adopted by @xcite the values of the one dimensional pairwise velocity dispersion is @xmath111 for the mock groups and @xmath112 for particles .",
    "the correlation function of particles and groups are well fitted by power laws with @xmath113 @xmath10 mpc , @xmath114 for particles and @xmath115 @xmath10 mpc , @xmath116 for groups .",

    "@xmath18 coordinates is strongly distorted along the @xmath18 direction due to the large pairwise particle velocities as well as their smaller correlation amplitude .",
    "these distortions are also similar to those shown in figure 1 for the galaxy catalog .",
    "we have computed the minimum @xmath25 value of the 1-dimensional pairwise rms velocity of groups and particles from the comparison of the estimated ( equation [ pred ] ) and the actual values of @xmath19 . by application of the first method described in section 3.1 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath117 and @xmath118 for groups and particles respectively , whereas the second method gives @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the results from the second method are in much better agreement with the actual values measured in the mock catalog than those from the first method ( see table 3 ) .",
    "we have also calculated the projected 2-point correlation function for groups and particles from the mock catalogs .",
    "using equation [ r0 ] we obtain estimates of correlation length , @xmath121 @xmath10 mpc for groups , and @xmath122 @xmath10 mpc for particles ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "these values agree very well with the ones of the computational box ( @xmath123 @xmath10 mpc and @xmath124 @xmath10 mpc for groups and particles , respectively ) , again indicating the efficiency of the methods adopted in deriving unbiased estimates of the parameter @xmath13 . in effect , by means of equation [ beta ] and with the derived parameters of the correlation function , we obtain @xmath125 ( one standard deviation ) and @xmath126 , which give a suitable agreement with the true values @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively as can be appreciated in figure 8 .",
    "we notice the differences between mock and real data ( figures 4 and 5 compared to figures 7 and 8) .",
    "these are mainly due to the different number of data points used , since we aimed to test the statistical procedures with catalogs with similar correlation and dynamical properties but with a larger number of points to improve accuracy to test for small systematic effects .",
    "taking into account the success of the different tests carried out , we conclude that the methods applied in section 3 give reliable estimates of the real - space clustering and mean rms pairwise velocity of groups and galaxies providing suitable estimates of the @xmath13 parameter .",
    "the tests also indicate that the second method provides more stable and confident results of @xmath19 .",
    "two - point correlation functions of groups and galaxies were computed from the uzc .",
    "the correlation function @xmath0 in the components parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight , allow us to characterize the pairwise peculiar velocities .",

    "more stable results come from the comparison of correlation level contours , where we obtain @xmath129 and @xmath130 for groups and galaxies respectively .",
    "we have estimated the real - space correlation function using a power - law fit @xmath4 for groups and galaxies .",
    "the correlation length , @xmath7 , is obtained from the projected correlation function @xmath85 , using the values of @xmath5 derived from the correlation function in projected separations @xmath6 .",
    "the best fitting values for the parameters are : @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xmath10 mpc for groups , and @xmath133 and @xmath134 @xmath10 mpc for galaxies .",

    "the results for groups remain unchanged at @xmath135 . for galaxies ,",

    "the results show a good agreement well to those obtained in other optical surveys ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , our value of @xmath138 is entirely consistent with @xmath139 , obtained for the durham - ukst galaxy redshift survey by @xcite .",
    "our determination of the real - space correlation length @xmath140 @xmath10 mpc is also comparable to that obtained in this survey @xmath141 @xmath10 mpc ( @xcite ) , although @xmath59 is steeper in uzc ( @xmath142 ) compared to @xmath143 in the durham - ukst redshift survey .",
    "we have also estimated the parameter @xmath14 for groups and galaxies using the linear approximation relating real and redshift - space correlation functions .",
    "consistent with previous works for other optical samples ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) we find @xmath144 .",
    "results for iras samples ( fisher et al .",
    "1994 , tadros et al .",
    "1999 ) are similar to those derived for optical samples in spite of their different bias parameters .",
    "as suggested by fisher et al",
    ". there may be a scale dependent galaxy biasing , although it should also be considered the possibility that different methods sensitive to a variety of factors may provide different results for a given sample .",
    "the reliability of our results has been tested using mock catalogs extracted from n - body simulations and the identification of three dimensional groups in these catalogs .",
    "the correlation function of groups and particles in @xmath1 and @xmath18 coordinates show a similar behavior than the one derived from the observations .",
    "the estimated and real values of the dimensional pairwise rms velocity of groups and particles in the simulations are comparable showing that our procedure is capable of deriving reasonable estimates of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "also , the best fitting parameters @xmath7 and @xmath5 for the group and particle correlation function are in excellent agreement with the true values in the three dimensional box indicating that our methods provide good estimates of the parameter @xmath13 .    given this fair agreement between derived and true values",
    "we conclude that the small angle approximation adopted in the analysis does not lead to systematic effects .",
    "a similar argument holds for the derivation of the @xmath13 parameter using @xcite linear formula which gives a very good agreement with the actual value in the simulation , supporting the reliability of the parameter @xmath13 derived from uzc galaxies .",
    "spurious large anisotropies along the line of sight obtained for abell clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) are significantly reduced in the analysis of the apm cluster survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "these large anisotropies would arise by inhomogeneities in the detection of clusters in two dimensions and are entirely absent in guzc sample which shows the compression due to the infall onto larger structures .",
    "the main reason why these anisotropies are not present in guzc is the that the groups are identified in an homogeneous catalog with angular positions and redshifts .",
    "the low value derived for the one - dimensional pairwise rms velocity of groups @xmath147 is indicative of a smoothly varying peculiar velocity field from galaxies to systems of galaxies , as expected in a hierarchical scenario of structure formation .",
