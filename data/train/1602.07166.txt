    "high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) of circularly polarized light was studied theoretically already in the 1990s  @xcite but experimental demonstrations were not successful until very recently  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally obtained high - harmonic spectra for such fields , including extensions towards elliptical drivers  @xcite , inspired theoretical efforts to provide simple explanations for the observed features , in particular with respect to conservation of photon angular momenta and corresponding selection rules  @xcite .",
    "generating isolated circularly polarized high harmonics has been the subject of further theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies .",
    "furthermore , it was shown recently that high - harmonic spectra with circular polarization can be made to reach even into the soft x - ray regime  @xcite .    at the base of most schemes for generation of high - harmonic circular light",
    "lies the use of a driving field that is a superposition of two copropagating but counter - rotating circular drivers with different frequencies .",
    "it has recently also been shown that counter - rotating drivers with the same frequency can be used when employing a non - collinear driving scheme  @xcite . in a somewhat different context , namely in the presence of additional static electromagnetic fields , hhg with such counter - rotating fields",
    "was also studied in the 2000s  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies neither considered the generated high - harmonic light in terms of its circularly polarized components nor did they report significant effects on the spectrum for readily available static magnetic and electric field strengths .    in this paper we show how a great deal of understanding of hhg with non - linearly polarized driving fields can be obtained by going to a rotating frame .",
    "focusing on the paradigmatic case of counter - rotating bicircular drivers we illustrate how this allows to obtain a surprisingly simple characterization that even enables the formulation of optimal strategies for obtaining high - order harmonics with well - characterized circular polarization .",
    "we begin by describing in sec .",

    "[ sub : bicirc optimise ] how the rotating - frame description allows to formulate an optimal experimental strategy towards obtaining a high - harmonic plateau in the emission spectrum that is as far extended as possible while still separating the left and right circularly - polarized components energetically .",
    "we support these findings with numerical simulations of hhg on the single - atom level by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation for a two - dimensional model atom using the single - active - electron approximation .",
    "we finish our discussion by presenting two particular perspectives on the rotating - frame description : in sec .",
    "[ sec : perspectives i ] we consider a more general setup involving elliptical driving fields and in sec .",

    "( [ eq : general_rotation_ham ] ) cancel and only a linearly polarized field with frequency @xmath17 remains .",
    "hence we obtain for the total hamiltonian in the rotating frame , @xmath18 we will mostly focus on the case @xmath19 whence by eq .",
    "( [ eq : linearising alpha ] ) @xmath20 follows .",
    "we conclude that the dynamics of two counter - rotating circularly polarized driving fields can be interpreted as a single linearly polarized driver with double the field strength at the mean frequency . in the rotating frame",
    "an additional angular momentum term appears , which we will call coriolis term in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , proportional to half the difference frequency . for two",
    "co - rotating circularly polarized drivers the result is almost identical and can be obtained by substituting @xmath21 .",
    "the linearly polarized field in this case has a frequency equal to half the difference in frequency between the circular drivers while the coriolis term will now be equal to @xmath22 with @xmath23 corresponding to the mean frequency .",
    "how does one translate the harmonic signal of an atom or molecule from the rotating frame back to the lab frame ?",
    "the high - harmonic signal in the lab frame has regularly been associated with the square of the fourier transform of the dipole expectation value  @xcite , e.g. , for the harmonic signal in @xmath24-direction one obtains @xmath25 where the expectation value @xmath26 is taken with respect to the time - dependent wave function in the lab frame , @xmath27 .",
    "note that we already absorbed the minus sign from the dipole expectation value due to the electronic charge into the modulus .",
    "the wave function in the rotating frame is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitary ] ) . using @xmath30",
    "we obtain the expression @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes expectation values with respect to the time - dependent wave function in the rotating frame .",
    "the analogous expressions for the @xmath33-direction , @xmath34 , as well as the right - circular component , @xmath35 , and left - circular component , @xmath36 , are given by @xmath37 for the circular components the expressions can be significantly simplified by using cylindrical coordinates which leads to the expressions @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this equation alludes to a direct connection between the harmonic spectra obtained in the rotating frame and the high - harmonic spectra in the lab frame .",
    "in fact , a short calculation shows that @xmath41 and analogously @xmath42 we conclude that the right ( left ) circular signal in the lab frame is obtained via the right ( left ) circular signal in the rotating frame shifted in frequency by @xmath43 to the left ( to the right ) .",
    "we emphasize that this statement is general and no assumptions on @xmath44 or the particular structure of @xmath0 ( with the exception of its axial symmetry ) have been made .",
    "this simple relationship between the circular spectral components in lab frame and rotating frame allows to directly apply any insights obtained about the high harmonic spectra in the rotating frame when discussing the experimentally observed spectra in the lab frame .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that often the high - harmonic signal is associated with the fourier transform of the dipole acceleration rather than that of the dipole moment @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ sec : dipole acceleration ] we show that computing the corresponding expectation values via ehrenfest s theorem with a slight modification allows to preserve the validity of eqs .",

    "we compute high - harmonic spectra via the dipole acceleration using ehrenfest s theorem .",
    "in the linearizing rotating frame , the high - harmonic signal of right - circular , respectively left - circular , polarization is very similar to that of the system under a linearly polarized driver at the mean frequency , shifted with half the difference frequency up , respectively down , cf .",

    ". we will continue to call the prefactor of the coriolis term , corresponding to the negative rotation frequency of the rotating frame , @xmath43 .",

    "we can formulate the well - known selection rules of hhg driven by a linearly polarized pulse , i.e. , we obtain a signal only at odd multiples of @xmath17 .",
    "note that these selection rules are not altered by the coriolis term since it neither breaks the inversion symmetry nor the conservation of @xmath65 and @xmath6 . in the lab frame",

    "we can even go a step further and understand the temporal generation process of the circularly polarized light from the perspective of the rotating frame .",
    "the highest ionization probability , which according to the three - step model @xcite forms the starting point of hhg , occurs around the peaks of the electric field . in the rotating frame",
    "this means we have bursts of linearly polarized light at minima and maxima of the electric field with frequency @xmath54 . in terms of the period of the first harmonic driver @xmath71 we consequently obtain bursts of linearly polarized high - harmonic radiation at @xmath72 . as discussed above , at least for moderately small coriolis terms",

    "however , we note that the emission of high - harmonic bursts can occur at both maxima and minima of the driving field .",
    "since the driving field is linearly polarized in @xmath24-direction in the rotating frame we can relate these maxima and minima by considering a mirroring at the rotating - frame @xmath33-axis .",
    "such a mirroring leads to a shift of the emission angle in the lab frame by @xmath80 .",
    "consequently , taking into account both emission around a maximum and a minimum of the electric field , we obtain the following time - angle pairs : @xmath75 , @xmath81 , @xmath77 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds precisely to the emission pattern predicted by previous works  @xcite in which in each cycle of the fundamental driver three linearly polarized emission bursts are predicted , each rotated by an angle of @xmath85 with respect to each other .",

    ", it seems natural to expect that a decrease in @xmath17 , respectively an increase in @xmath86 , will still lead to an extension of the high - harmonic plateau by increasing the ponderomotive potential .",

    "increasing the value of @xmath43 gradually depresses the high - harmonic plateau , cf .",
    "[ fig : dual_linear_005](b)-(d ) .",
    "this effect can be rationalized by a simple semiclassical argument . for higher harmonics",
    "the excursion of the electron needs to be further and further away from the nucleus , corresponding to a higher energy gain in the electric field in the framework of the three - step model .",
    "however , the larger the distance from the nucleus the stronger the effect of the @xmath6-term will be which leads to acceleration of the electron in the @xmath33-direction .",
    "this deflection will reduce the @xmath24-elongation in favor of the @xmath33-elongation . as a consequence",
    "the energy acquired by the electron in the electric field is reduced as it is proportional to only the @xmath24-component of its elongation since the laser pulse is linearly polarized in @xmath24-direction in the rotating frame .",
    "incidentally , this also allows for a simple explanation on why counter - rotating drivers are significantly more suitable than co - rotating drivers if one aims to obtain circularly polarized high - harmonics . in a co - rotating scheme @xmath43",
    "is not given by half of the difference of the frequencies of the two drivers in the lab frame but by the average of their frequencies .",
    "this immediately implies a much larger value of @xmath43 leading to a much stronger depression of the high - harmonic plateau compared to an equivalent counter - rotating scheme .",

    "[ fig : dual_linear_005 ] , shifted according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : plus signal ] ) and ( [ eq : minus signal ] ) to obtain the circular components of the harmonic signal in the lab frame , one can observe an interesting dichotomy .",
    "on the one hand our results clearly show that using two drivers that are as close in frequency as possible leads to the least reduction in the high - harmonic plateau , on the other hand one requires a sufficiently large @xmath43 to obtain spectrally separated signals for the two circular polarization directions in the lab frame . the width of the harmonic peaks is primarily determined by the temporal width of the drivers .",
    "hence , the optimal strategy to obtain spectral selectivity for the two polarization directions while having a harmonic plateau that is as far extended as possible consists in choosing @xmath43 just above the spectral width of the harmonic peaks .",
    "specifically , for the typically chosen ` fundamental plus second harmonic ' driving scheme , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual_linear_005](c ) , we observe that our particular chosen set of parameters would still allow closer frequencies for the bicircular drivers while maintaining a sufficient spectral separation of the right - circular and left - circular harmonic peaks , cf .",
    "[ fig : dual_linear_005](b ) .    from an experimental point of view",
    "this means that for driving pulses with several optical cycles the best results will be obtained by choosing driving fields originating from a laser with frequency @xmath96 where the left - circularly polarized driver is tuned lower by a small amount while the right - circularly polarized driver is tuned higher by the same amount ( or vice versa ) .",
    "conversely , if the driving fields consist of only very few cycles then the spectral width of the peaks will increase and it is likely that choosing low - order harmonics of a fundamental frequencies is a more suitable approach . in particular , employing a left - circularly polarized driver at some fundamental @xmath97 and a right - circularly polarized driver at the third harmonic @xmath98 leads to @xmath99 and a maximal spectral separation of the peaks in the high - harmonic spectrum given by @xmath17 .",

    ". however , if the magnetic field is established sufficiently slowly the ground state will likely remain invariant due to adiabatic following . for the case of static electric fields",
    "very similar arguments hold .",
    "previous theoretical studies in terms of static electric and magnetic fields concluded that an appreciable impact on the hhg spectra can only be observed for field strengths at the very edge of experimental feasibility @xcite . in a rotating - frame picture these field strengths are achieved rather naturally since they originate from ac field strengths ( for electric fields ) , respectively from the frequency of the rotating - frame description ( for magnetic fields ) .",
    "for example , using an @xmath146 nm right - circularly polarized driver and its second harmonic at @xmath147  nm as a left - circularly polarized driver , the linearizing rotating frame as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : linearising rotating frame ] leads to a coriolis term which would correspond by eq .",
    "( [ eq : statmag ] ) to a static magnetic field of almost @xmath148  t.    circular high - harmonic emission in the lab frame and the rotating frame are directly related to each other by only a shift in frequency , cf .",

    "this allows on the one hand to directly apply knowledge about static - field effects to understanding high harmonic spectra of circular light while on the other hand enabling the possibility to engineer hamiltonians in the rotating frame that realize the effects of such static fields even at field strengths beyond current technical feasibility .",
    "hhg of circularly polarized light with bicircular drivers can be understood in many ways , ranging from a purely photonic picture to a strictly classical four - wave mixing interpretation @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple way to approach this process is by moving to a rotating frame of reference where the bicircular driving reduces to a linearly polarized field and a coriolis term @xcite .",
    "we showed in this paper that the circularly polarized components of the high - harmonic signal in the lab frame follow directly from their counterparts in the rotating frame under a simple shift in frequency .",
    "this allows to directly deduce properties of those spectra and even the generation process itself from the well - studied hhg with linearly polarized driving fields .",
    "the influence of the coriolis term for axially symmetric systems on the high - harmonic plateau consists in a reduction of the cutoff frequency proportional to the strength of this term .",
    "otherwise it does not alter the peak structure in the spectrum due to the preservation of the axial symmetry . as a consequence it is possible to determine the optimal bicircular drivers when the goal is to preserve a high - harmonic plateau that is extended as far as possible - the drivers need to be counter - rotating and their frequencies",
    "should be chosen as similarly as possible .",
    "only the need for a spectral separation of the two circularly polarized components requires to choose a nonzero difference in frequency to compensate for the finite width of the peaks in frequency domain due to the finite width of the driving fields in time .",
    "conversely , if such a spectral separation is not necessary because the right and left - circularly polarized signal can be otherwise filtered out , choosing identical frequencies is clearly the best approach .",
    "this is an observation that very recently has been made in an experimental study where circularly polarized high harmonics have been generated in a non - collinear scheme allowing for a spatial separation of the two circularization directions @xcite .    beyond the case of bicircular drivers",
    ", a rotating - frame picture also offers a valuable perspective on elliptical drivers .",
    "the occurrence of additional peaks in the high - harmonic spectrum when moving away from the bicircular case originates in a properly chosen rotating frame from the presence of an additional static electric field .",
    "this static electric field breaks the symmetries present for bicircular drivers and opens up additional channels for hhg in the rotating frame that can then be directly observed in the lab frame taking into account the corresponding shift in frequency .",
    "furthermore , the rotating - frame description of these schemes shows a near - duality to hhg under static electric and magnetic fields .",
    "while the effects of such fields have been examined in the past , the regime in which a visible impact on the spectra could be experimentally observed is mostly inaccessible due to the infeasibility of generating the corresponding strong fields .",
    "however , the rotating - frame picture clearly illustrates that the effect of such strong fields appear naturally in a suitably chosen frame of reference and the resulting modifications of the high - harmonic spectra of these ` virtual ' fields have clearly observable consequences in experiments that can readily be performed today .",
    "the rotating - frame picture proves to be a powerful tool in understanding hhg of circularly polarized light .",
    "depending on the particular choice of driving fields it enables a close correspondence to linearly polarized drivers and even hhg in the presence of static electric and magnetic fields .",
    "it can thus serve as a pivotal link between seemingly disjoint setups for hhg and allows for a remarkably simple explanation of many properties of the experimentally observed spectra .",
