    "it is a quite challenging theoretical problem to explain the basic properties of the strongly interacting many - body system because there is no exact solution for this nonlinear many - body system and the ordinary perturbation method can not give us a reliable quantitative theoretical predication .",
    "the strongly interacting fermi gases is a very important theoretical problem because the atomic nucleus , quark - gluon plasma and high temperature superconductivity _ etc _ relate closely to the strongly interacting fermi gases . due to the strong interaction ,",
    "a phenomenological theory would contribute largely to our understanding of this complex system .",
    "for example , for the atomic nucleus which is a complex many - body system bound by the strong interaction , there is a successful phenomenological theory by introducing an effective force .",
    "obviously , clear experimental investigations can give us important clues to find a reasonable phenomenological model and even a theory to reveal the microscopic mechanism accounting for the basic phenomena of the strongly interacting many - body system .",
    "in the last few years , the experimental advances on the ultracold strongly interacting two - component fermi gases such as @xcite provide us an important opportunity to develop a theory of the strongly interacting system .",
    "there is a broad interest in the ultracold two - component fermi gases because the two - component fermi gases can be cooled to a temperature far below the fermi temperature so that there is an obvious quantum statistical effect .",
    "another special interest in this system lies in that through a magnetic - field feshbach resonance , one can change in a controllable way the value and even sign of the scattering length @xmath0 between atoms . for two - component fermi gases ,",
    "when the magnetic field is tuned so that the energy of a quasibound molecular state in a closed channel matches the total energy in an open channel , there is a magnetic - field feshbach resonance . below the feshbach resonant magnetic field ( bec side ) , the interaction between atoms is repulsive and there exists molecule which is a short - range fermionic atom pairs .",
    "below the critical temperature , there is a molecular bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) which has been observed in the recent experiments @xcite . above the feshbach resonant magnetic field ( bcs side ) ,",
    "the interaction between atoms is attractive and there would be a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid behavior due to the atomic cooper pairs at sufficient low temperature .",
    "recently , by tuning the uniform magnetic field near the resonant magnetic field , there are a lot of interesting experimental works on the bcs - bec crossover grimm , jin - fermion , mit - fermion , thomas , grimm1,cheng , salomon , heat such as the measurement of the cloud size @xcite , condensate fraction jin - fermion , mit - fermion , collective excitation @xcite , pairing gap @xcite , and heat capacity @xcite _ etc_. besides the pioneering theoretical works @xcite , in the last few years , there are intensive theoretical investigations on the bcs - bec crossover stoof , timm , milstein , ohashi1,staj , wu , carr , bruun , falco , stri , xiongcross , xiong - coe , heiselberg , carlson , ho1,ho , xiongon , torma , levin , cheng - mean such as resonance superfluid @xcite and universal behavior for the gases with divergent scattering length heiselberg , carlson , ho1,ho , xiongon .    in the bcs - bec crossover regime ,",
    "the scattering length becomes divergent on magnetic - field feshbach resonance , thus the system on resonance gives us an ideal system to investigate directly the strongly interacting many - body system . in the limit of this strong interaction ,",
    "the scattering length becomes divergent and thus it should not appear in the final expression of a physical quantity .",
    "for the ultracold gases with divergent scattering length , it is a quite attractive theoretical problem considering the possibility that a phenomenological theoretical model would be very simple because the scattering length will not appear in the final expression of the physical quantity although it is the most important parameter to show the interaction between particles . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate theoretically the thermodynamic properties of the two - component fermi gases in the case of the scattering length being much larger than the average distance @xmath1 between particles . on the side of weakly attractive ( or repulsive ) interaction , there are pairs of atoms in the form of atomic cooper pairs ( or molecules ) which has been verified through the experimental investigation of the condensation fraction @xcite and pairing gap @xcite .",
    "generalizing this observation , we assume here that there are dimers which comprise two fermionic atoms with different spin state for the system on magnetic - field feshbach resonance .",
    "most recently , there is a measurement of the heat capacity @xcite for strongly interacting fermi gases of @xmath2 atoms which gives clearly the evidence of a phase transition for the emergence of the fermion pairs . in the present work , at finite temperature as well as zero temperature ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system such as the entropy , transition temperature , fraction of dimers are investigated based on a simple theoretical model that the system is in a mixture of the fermi gases and dimeric gas below the transition temperature .    in sec .",
    "ii , at zero temperature , we consider the thermodynamic properties for the mixture gases of fermionic atoms and dimers based on the chemical equilibrium condition .",
    "it is found that this theoretical model is consistent with the recent experimental investigation of the condensate fraction mit - fermion and collective excitations @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of fermi gases and dimeric gas at zero temperature means that there should be a phase transition for the emergence of dimeric gas at finite temperature . in sec .",
    "iii , when the thermal excitation of the dimers is considered , we give a transition temperature that below this transition temperature there would be a stable dimeric gas .",
    "the fraction of dimers below the transition temperature is also given . in sec .",
    "iv , through the investigation of the overall entropy of the fermi gases and dimeric gas , we calculate the relation between the energy and temperature of the system .",
    "the role of the dimeric gas is discussed and found that the theoretical result based on the presence of the dimeric gas is in agreement with the recent experiment about heat capacity @xcite .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary and discussion in sev . v.",
    "in the experiment @xcite about the heat capacity , the phase transition for the strongly interacting fermi gases is observed clearly at a transition temperature .",
    "if there is a phase transition for the emergence of a stable dimeric gas at a transition temperature , there would be a mixture of two - component fermi gases and dimeric gas below the transition temperature , and the evidence for the mixture of two - component fermi gases and dimeric gas would give us an important evidence that there is a phase transition for the emergence of the stable dimeric gas . to give a clear presentation , we first propose in this section a theoretical model based on the mixture of two - component fermi gases and dimeric gas at zero temperature @xcite , while in the following sections we will consider the thermodynamic properties of this mixture gas at finite temperature .    in the present experiments on two - component fermi gases , an equal mixture of fermi gases",

    "the dynamic equilibrium is characterized by the fact that the gibbs free energy of the system is a minimum . assuming that @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the chemical potential of the fermi gases and @xmath12 being the chemical potential of the dimeric gas",

    "one can get a rough expression for the chemical potential through a dimensional analysis that @xmath21 . based on this dimensional analysis and local density approximation , at zero temperature , one can get the following form of the chemical potential @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) for the fermi gas :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the external potential of the fermionic atoms . without @xmath26 ,",
    "the above expression gives the chemical potential of an ideal fermi gas in the local density approximation .",

    "the chemical potential of the system is obviously lower than the case without dimers .",

    "after the dimer - molecule conversion , in mit - fermion the maximum fraction of the molecules in zero - momentum state is observed to be @xmath53 . in this case , @xmath54 is estimated to be @xmath55 .    at zero temperature and",

    "due to the stability and pauli blocking , the dimer - molecule conversion will always convert the fermionic atom pairs in a same dimer into bound molecules .",
    "thus at zero temperature , all the dimers will be converted into molecules with zero - momentum state during the dimer - molecule conversion process .",
