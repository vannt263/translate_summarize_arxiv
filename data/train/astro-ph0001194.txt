    "since most of these searches have been confined to a narrow field of view around the primary ( typically 10 - 60@xmath9 ) , widely separated companions ; see @xcite .",
    "] may be missed .",
    "indeed , both g 196 - 3b and gl 229b are less than 20@xmath9 from their primary .",
    "field surveys , such as the two micron all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) , the deep near infrared survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter denis ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss ) , overcome this limitation . indeed , @xcite have recently identified two l - type brown dwarf companions at wide separation .",
    "we are currently searching the 2mass catalogs for field t dwarfs @xcite , brown dwarfs spectrally identified by ch@xmath3 absorption bands at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one of our discoveries , 2massw j1457150 - 212148 ( hereafter gl 570d ) , has been confirmed as a widely separated , common proper motion companion to the gl 570abc system .",
    "this system is comprised of a k4v primary and a m1.5v - m3v close binary @xcite at a distance of 5.91@xmath10.06 pc @xcite . in @xmath102",
    "we describe the selection of this object from the 2mass database , review subsequent observations , and establish its common proper motion with gl 570abc . in @xmath103",
    "we estimate l and t@xmath7 of gl 570d based on its distance and brightness , and make t@xmath7 and mass estimates using the evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "gl 570d was initially selected as a t dwarf candidate from the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "t dwarf candidates were required to have j- and h - band detections with j @xmath11 16 ( 2mass signal - to - noise ratio @xmath12 10 limit ) , j - h @xmath11 0.3 and h - k@xmath13 @xmath11 0.3 ( limit or detection ) , @xmath14 ( to eliminate source confusion in the galactic plane ) , and no optical counterpart in the usno - a catalog @xcite within 10@xmath9 .",
    "close optical doubles not identified by usno - a and proper motion stars were eliminated by examination of digitized sky survey ( dss ) images of the serc - j and aao ses @xcite surveys .",
    "our search criteria are also sensitive to minor planets , due to their intrinsically blue near - infrared colors @xcite , lack of optical counterpart at an earlier epoch , and point - like appearance due to the short 2mass exposure time ( 7.8 seconds ) .",
    "follow - up near - infrared imaging to eliminate these objects from our candidate pool was carried out on the cerro tololo infrared imager ( cirim ) on the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) ritchey - chretien 1.5 m during 1999 july 23 - 25 ( ut ) .",
    "gl 570d was one of only 11 candidates detected in these observations ( the remaining candidates were likely asteroids ) .",
    "optical images of the gl 570d field from the serc - j and aao ses surveys , as well as 2mass j- and k@xmath13-band images , are shown in figure 1 ; the gl 570abc triple can be seen in the lower left corner .",
    "no optical counterpart is seen at either the current or projected ( proper motion ) positions of gl 570d , indicating very red optical - infrared colors .",
    "table 1 lists 2mass j , h , and k@xmath13 magnitudes ( rows [ 1]-[3 ] ) and colors ( rows [ 4]-[6 ] ) for gl 570d , as well as measurements for g 196 - 3b and gl 229b taken from the literature @xcite and from 2mass data .",
    "note that gl 570d has blue near - infrared colors , similar to gl 229b .",
    "the 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath2 fundamental overtone ch@xmath3 bands were identified in gl 570d from near - infrared spectral data taken with the ohio state infrared imager / spectrometer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter osiris ) on the ctio blanco 4 m on 1999 july 27 ( ut ) .",
    "using osiris s cross - dispersion mode , we obtained continuous 1.2 - 2.3 @xmath2 spectra with @xmath15/@xmath16@xmath15 @xmath17 1200 .",
    "the slit width was fixed at 1@xmath182 for all observations .",
    "the object was placed on the slit by direct image centroiding , and then stepped across the slit in seven positions at 3@xmath9 intervals ( to offset fringing and detector artifacts ) with 120-second integrations at each position .",
    "a total of 3360 seconds of integration time was acquired .",
    "spectra were then extracted using standard iraf reduction packages .",
    "raw data were flat - fielded using observations of the 4 m illuminated dome spot and software generously supplied by r.  blum at ctio .",
    "object spectra were extracted using a template from the a1v standard star hr 5696 @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration was computed from oh sky lines .",
    "finally , telluric corrections and relative flux calibration were done using the extracted standard spectrum .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum of gl 570d is shown in figure 2 , along with data for the sdss t dwarf sdssp j162414.37 + 002915.6 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter sdss1624 + 00 ) obtained on the same night .",
    "both spectra are normalized at 1.55 @xmath2 , with sdss1624 + 00 offset vertically by a constant .",
    "gl 229b spectral data from @xcite , also normalized at 1.55 @xmath2 , are overlain on both for comparison ( dark line ) .",
    "the 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath2 ch@xmath3 bands are present in all three brown dwarfs , as well as combined h@xmath19o and ch@xmath3 absorption from 1.3 to 1.5 @xmath2 .",
    "suppression of flux around 2.1 @xmath2 is likely due to increased h@xmath19 absorption in the low temperature atmospheres @xcite .",
    "there is a striking similarity in the spectral morphology of these objects ; however , the overlaid spectrum of gl 229b may indicate some subtle differences .",
    "there appears to be a slight enhancement in flux ( relative to gl 229b ) in sdss1624 + 00 at the blue edge of the 1.3 @xmath2 absorption feature and at the base of the 1.6 @xmath2 ch@xmath3 absorption band .",
    "conversely , the spectrum of gl 570d does not show these features and in fact appears slightly deficient at the 1.5 @xmath2 h@xmath19o - ch@xmath3 wing and the 2.1 @xmath2 flux peak .",
    "we might expect such variations if sdss1624 + 00 is warmer than gl 229b and gl 570d cooler , as ch@xmath3 bands at 1.4 and 1.6 @xmath2 should deepen as the observed temperature decreases , since the conversion of co to ch@xmath3 will occur at greater optical depth @xcite .",
    "similarly , there should be increased h@xmath19 absorption in the k - band toward lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "while metallicity and mixing effects may complicate these simple arguments , the warmer temperature of sdss 1624 + 00 is supported by recent detections of feh and crh bands in its optical spectrum @xcite which are disappearing in the latest l dwarfs @xcite , as well as shallower h@xmath19o and ch@xmath3 bands in the near - infrared as compared to gl 229b @xcite .",
    "the coolness of gl 570d , based on its association with gl 570abc , is discussed below .      the proximity of the bright gl 570abc triple led us to suspect possible association for this 2mass object .",
    "fortunately , the system has a relatively high proper motion of 2@xmath0012@xmath10@xmath0002 yr@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in addition , multiple sampling and the 2mass position reconstruction strategy results in a higher astrometric accuracy ( @xmath12 0@xmath03 ) than the raw pixel scale of the 2mass detectors ( 2@xmath9 ) , sufficient to measure the motion of this system on a one - year timescale .",
    "the original 2mass scan of the gl 570d field was taken on 1998 may 16 ( ut ) ; a second scan was obtained on 1999 july 29 ( ut ) .",
    "table 2 summarizes the resulting astrometric data , indicating that all components have a common sky motion of 2@xmath03@xmath10@xmath04 at position angle 155@xmath18@xmath21 .",
    "the mean motion of all other correlated sources in the same 2mass scan as gl 570d with j @xmath11 15.8 ( @xmath17 2000 sources ) is 0@xmath00@xmath10@xmath02 in right ascension and 0@xmath02@xmath10@xmath01 in declination .",
    "this statistically significant common proper motion confirms companionship .",
    "gl 570d lies 258@xmath03@xmath10@xmath04 from the k4v primary , a projected physical separation of 1525@xmath115 au .",
    "note that this is an order of magnitude larger than the a - bc separation ( 24@xmath07@xmath10@xmath04 ) and over four orders of magnitude larger than the b - c separation of 0@xmath01507@xmath10@xmath00007 @xcite .",
    "the separation of gl 570d is compared to those of g 196 - 3b and gl 229b in table 1 ( rows [ 7]-[8 ] ) .",
    "the dynamic stability of this system can be addressed using the results of @xcite with the separations listed in table 2 and masses of 0.7 m@xmath6 for gl 570a ( estimated from the measured mass of the m0ve eclipsing binary yy gem ; bopp 1974 ) , 1.0 m@xmath6 for combined gl 570bc ( directly measured by forveille et al .",
    "1999 ) , and 0.05 m@xmath6 for gl 570d ( estimated , as discussed below ) .",
    "we find that the system is dynamically stable for eccentricities less than about 0.6 .",
    "a more rigorous analysis using measured orbital parameters is restricted by the roughly 40,000-year period of gl 570d around the gl 570abc barycenter .",
    "distance moduli and absolute j magnitudes for the three brown dwarf companions g 196 - 3b , gl 229b , and gl 570d , based on the distances to their respective primaries , are listed in table 1 ( rows [ 9]-[10 ] ) .",
    "gl 570d is nearly a magnitude fainter than gl 229b at all three near - infrared bands .",
    "if we assume a gl 229b j - band bolometric correction of 2.19@xmath10.10 @xcite and a radius of ( 7.0@xmath10.5)x10@xmath22 cm @xmath17 1 jupiter radius @xcite , we then derive l = ( 2.8@xmath10.3)x10@xmath5 l@xmath6 and t@xmath7 = 750@xmath150 k , roughly 200 k cooler than gl 229b , making gl 570d the least luminous and coolest brown dwarf thus far detected .",
    "more accurate determinations of the effective temperature and mass of gl 570d can be made using brown dwarf evolutionary models , but only if we can constrain its age ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the proximity of gl 570abc has permitted detailed studies of kinematic properties , activity , and high energy emission ( uv and x - ray ) , leading to various age estimates for the system @xcite .",
    "there is a general consensus among these authors that this system is older than 2 gyr , which is supported by the lack of activity in the close bc binary @xcite .",
    "the solar - like metallicity of gl 570abc @xcite and the system s total space motion of @xmath17 60 km s@xmath20 @xcite constrains formation to the galactic disk , which establishes a rough upper limit of about 10 gyr . using the evolutionary models of @xcite and adopting log ( l / l@xmath6 ) = -5.56@xmath10.05 and @xmath23 = 6@xmath14 gyr , we derive values of t@xmath7 = 790@xmath140 k , and m = 50@xmath120 m@xmath8 = 1.9x10@xmath24 grams = 0.0095 m@xmath6 . ] ( table 1 , rows [ 13]-[14 ] ) .",
    "the effective temperature is consistent with the brightness estimate above , and is significantly lower than those of g 196 - 3b and gl 229b .",
    "perhaps most interesting is that , despite having the lowest t@xmath7 , gl 570d could possibly be the most massive of these three brown dwarfs .",
    "this accentuates the difficulty of basing comparisons of brown dwarfs on brightness and/or temperature alone , and the importance of age determinations in deriving the physical properties of cool brown dwarfs .",
    "more accurate estimates of this object s properties require spectral modeling and additional broad - band photometry , and will be addressed in a future paper .",
