    "axial vertices in the anomalous graphs such as the avv and vaaa ones , couple the quarks with pseudoscalar mesons . instead of anomalous graphs ,",
    "another way to study the related amplitudes involving pseudoscalar mesons , is to calculate the corresponding graphs where axial vertices ( a ) are replaced by pseudoscalar ( p ) ones .",

    "however , since the development of the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) approach to quark - hadron physics @xcite , the presently advocated method becomes even more convincing .",
    "namely , the ds approach clearly shows how the light pseudoscalar mesons simultaneously appear both as quark - antiquark ( @xmath27 ) bound states and as goldstone bosons of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath28sb ) of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the solutions of bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations for the bound - state vertices of pseudoscalar mesons then enter in the pvv triangle graph instead of the point @xmath25 coupling , and the current algebra result ( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) is again reproduced exactly and analytically , which is unique among the bound - state approaches . that the ( almost massless ) pseudoscalars are ( quasi-)goldstone bosons , is also a unique feature among the bound - state approaches to mesons .",
    "a reason why the p - coupling method is simpler both technically and conceptually is that the pvv triangle graph amplitude is _ finite _ , unlike the avv one , which is divergent and therefore also ambiguous with respect to the momentum routing .",

    "this simple ql model ( and hence also the lowest order @xmath28qm and the @xmath47-model ) provides an analytic expression ( _ e.g. _ , see ref .",

    "@xcite extended the amplitude ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) obtained by calculating the  box \" graph , fig . 2 , to the case of nonvanishing pion mass and/or nonvanishing pion momenta .",
    "in the aforementioned ds approach , one does not postulate constituent quarks , i.e. , effective free quasiparticles with propagators ( [ freesq ] ) . instead , in the ds approach one constructs constituent quarks by solving the ds equation ( the `` gap equation '' ) for the quark propagator .",
    "namely , in this way , starting from the current quarks which in the qcd lagrangian break chiral symmetry explicitly just by relatively small current mass @xmath65 , one obtains the dynamically dressed quark propagator @xmath66    even in the chiral limit , where @xmath67 so that chiral symmetry is not broken explicitly but only dynamically , d@xmath28sb gives the dressing functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 leading to the dynamically generated , momentum - dependent quark mass @xmath70 which , at small @xmath71 , takes values close to a phenomenologically required constituent mass @xmath72 in this way , the ds approach provides one with a modern constituent quark model possessing many remarkable features .",
    "its presently interesting feature is its relation with the abelian axial anomaly .",
    "other bound state approaches generally have problems with describing anomalous processes such as the famous @xmath1 and related anomalous decays .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparative discussion thereof . )",
    "thus , it was a significant advance in the theory of bound states , when roberts @xcite and bando _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the ds approach , in the chiral and soft limit , reproduces exactly the famous @xmath33  triangle \"- amplitude ( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) .",
    "later , in the same approach and limits , the reproduction of the related  box \"- amplitude ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) for the @xmath2 process was also achieved and clarified @xcite .",
    "just as the triangle amplitude ( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) , the box amplitude ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) is in the ds approach evaluated analytically and without any fine tuning of the bound - state description of the pions  @xcite .",
    "this happens because the ds approach incorporates d@xmath28sb into the bound states consistently , so that the pion , although constructed as a quark  antiquark composite described by its bs bound - state vertex @xmath73 , also appears as a goldstone boson in the chiral limit ( @xmath74 denotes the relative momentum of the quark and antiquark constituents of the pion bound state ) .",
    "technically , ds calculations of transition amplitudes are much more complicated than the corresponding free ql calculations ; not only more complicated , dressed quark propagators ( [ eucls ] ) are used instead of ( [ freesq ] ) , but the related momentum - dependent @xmath27 pseudoscalar pion bound state bs vertex solutions @xmath75 replace @xmath76 quark - pion yukawa point couplings used in ql calculations .",
    "still , these ingredients of the ds approach conspire together so that any dependence on what precisely the solutions for the dressed quark propagator ( [ eucls ] ) and the bs vertex @xmath73 are , drops out in the course of the analytical derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) and ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) in the chiral and soft limit .",
    "this is as it should be , because the amplitudes predicted by the anomaly ( again in the chiral limit @xmath77 and the soft limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , at zero four - momentum ) are independent of the bound - state structure , so that the ds approach is the bound - state approach that correctly incorporates the abelian axial anomaly .",
    "another crucial requirement for reproducing the abelian axial anomaly amplitudes in eqs .",
    "( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) and ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) , is that the electromagnetic interactions are embedded in the context of the ds approach in a way satisfying the vector ward ",
    "takahashi identity ( wti ) @xmath78 for the dressed quark - photon - quark ( @xmath79 ) vertex @xmath80 .",
    "the so - called generalized impulse approximation ( gia ) ( used , for example , by refs .",
    "@xcite ) is such a framework .",
    "there , the quark - photon - quark ( @xmath79 ) vertex @xmath80 is dressed so that it satisfies the vector wti ( [ vwti ] ) together with the quark propagators ( [ eucls ] ) , which are in turn dressed consistently with the solutions for the pion bound state bs vertices @xmath81 .",
    "the triangle graph for @xmath1 in fig . 1 and the box graph for @xmath82 in fig . 2 is a gia graph if all its propagators and vertices are dressed like this .",
    "( on the example of @xmath33 , table 1 of ref .",

    "the already published @xcite and presently planned primakoff experiments at cern @xcite , as well as the current cebaf measurement of the @xmath86 process @xcite involve values of energy and momentum transfer sufficiently large to give a lot of motivation for theoretical predictions of the extension of the anomalous @xmath87 amplitude away from the soft point .",
    "@xcite thus extended the ds calculation of the result ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) away from the soft and chiral limit , giving the corresponding form factor in the form of the expansion in the powers of the pion momenta and mass .",
    "( see also refs . @xcite . )",
    "some confusion has resulted from the fact that anomalous amplitudes ( such as those of @xmath1 and @xmath86 processes ) can be obtained either through the anomaly analysis or through the pseudoscalar coupling to quark loops as in subsections a and b above . in a way",
    ", this is a continuation of an earlier confusion when the veltman - sutherland theorem ( vsth ) @xcite was perceived to require the vanishing @xmath1 amplitude @xmath35 , in conflict with experiment .",
    "subsequently , vsth seemed to some to be invalidated by the anomaly which also explains the experimentally found @xmath1 width .",
    "but the steinberger - like calculation , i.e. , the p - coupling method , also explains the experimental @xmath1 width , and vsth is of course a valid mathematical result .",
    "to be precise , vsth is the exact statement that the quantity ( [ t_mu_nu ] ) , constructed from the vector electromagnetic current @xmath88 and the third isospin component of the isovector axial current @xmath89 as follows : @xmath90 | 0 \\rangle = \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta } k_{1\\alpha } k_{2\\beta }   \\phi(k_1 \\cdot k_2 , k_1 ^ 2 ,   k_2 ^ 2 ) + { \\cal o}[(k)^3 ] \\ , , \\label{t_mu_nu}\\ ] ] vanishes in the chiral limit as @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "( throughout , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the momenta of the two photons . )",
    "then , when the pcac relation for the third isospin component , @xmath94 , is modified by abelian anomaly to read @xmath95 it becomes clear that vsth , i.e. , the vanishing of eq .",
    "( [ t_mu_nu ] ) , does _ not _ imply @xmath96 , but that vsth relates the steinberger - like calculation of the pvv amplitude to the anomaly .",
    "that is , vsth dictates that in the chiral limit , the pvv @xmath1 amplitude is given exactly by the coefficient of the anomaly term .",
    "this is precisely the result ( [ pi2gammaamp ] ) , empirically successful and of the order @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "note that together with the result ( [ g3pianomamp ] ) , the above discussion also clarifies the relationship of the anomaly and the pvvv `` box '' calculation of the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "even with the above understanding , one may wonder when and why the wz term should or should not be included in one s lagrangian .",
    "the wz term naturally appears when the quarks are integrated out so that one obtains a low - energy theory containing only the meson fields .",
    "the situation is more subtle when the quarks are left in the theory .",
    "georgi explains pedagogically @xcite the relationship and equivalence between the following two distinct cases . _",
    "( i ) _ if the quarks transform nonlinearly under the chiral transformations , in which case all their interactions explicitly involve derivatives so that one has axial couplings of the quarks to mesons , but no such pseudoscalar couplings , the wz term must be included . _",
    "( ii ) _ equivalently , the quarks can transform linearly , and in this case the wz term is not present .",
    "the quarks chirally transforming linearly are related to the quarks transforming nonlinearly by a chiral transformation . in this case",
    "the quark mass term assumes the form ( [ massterm ] ) , which contains nonderivative , pseudoscalar ( @xmath98 ) couplings of the quarks to the goldstone bosons .",
    "this is seen by comparing eq .",
    "( [ massterm ] ) with the expansion ( [ 1leff ] ) if one takes into account that the couplings are determined by the quark - level gt relation ( [ gtrel ] ) .    on the basis of the above experience with the @xmath99 and @xmath2 amplitudes",
    ", we can expect the complete equivalence of the cases _ ( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ , that is , of the anomaly and p - coupling calculations . for that , the p - coupling ( `` steinberger - like '' ) calculations with the coupling ( [ massterm ] ) , should reproduce the effects of the wz term .",
    "indeed , georgi shows that one can obtain any coupling in the wz term from a steinberger - like quark loop calculation @xcite .",
    "here , it suffices to illustrate this on the example of the @xmath99 `` triangle''pvv calculation , where squeezing the quark loop to a point would amount to having the effective @xmath100 interaction ( [ l_pi2gamma ] ) but with the coupling predicted to be ( in the chiral limit ) @xmath101 which makes eq .",

    "the mass matrix squared @xmath179 in the quark basis @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 is    @xmath183 + \\beta          \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccl } 1 & 1 & x \\\\                                    1 & 1 & x \\\\                                    x & x & x^2          \\end{array } \\right]~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath184 is the non - anomalous part of the matrix , since @xmath185 and @xmath186 would be the masses of the respective  non - strange \" ( ns ) and  strange \" ( s ) @xmath187 mesons if there were no gluon anomaly . in the ns sector , in the isospin symmetry limit ( which is very close to reality ) , the relevant combinations are @xmath188 as the neutral partner of the charged pions @xmath189 in the isospin 1 triplet , and the isospin 0 combination @xmath190 . in the absence of gluon anomaly , but with an @xmath191-quark mass heavier than the isosymmetric @xmath7 and @xmath8 ones , @xmath29 would reduce to @xmath192 with the mass @xmath193 , and @xmath30 to @xmath194 with the mass @xmath195 .",
    "both of these assignments are in conflict with experiment .",
    "the realistic contributions of various flavors to @xmath29 and @xmath30 and their masses ( i.e. , the realistic @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing ) are obtained only thanks to @xmath196 , the anomalous contribution to the mass matrix . in @xmath196",
    ",    the quantity @xmath197 describes transitions @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) due to the gluon anomaly and @xmath200 describes the effects of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking on these transitions . in refs .",
    "@xcite , as the first step in solving the @xmath0 problem , we extract @xmath178 , @xmath173 masses from the @xmath29 , @xmath125 via    @xmath201    where @xmath202 .",
    "the mesons @xmath178 and @xmath173 are defined as    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        the @xmath178 meson mass ( [ meta8 ] ) @xmath204 is 4.56% greater than the observed @xcite @xmath205 . the singlet @xmath173 mass ( [ meta1 ] ) @xmath206 is only 1.56% below the observed @xmath207 and close to the nonstrange@xmath126 mixing @xmath0 mass dictated by phenomenology @xcite @xmath208^{1/2 } = 915.31~{\\mbox{\\rm mev}}~ , \\label{secondu1amass}\\ ] ] ( this is also close to @xmath209 , which is the mass found in the analogous ds approach @xcite . )",
    "we call the quantity ( [ secondu1amass ] ) the  mixing @xmath0 mass \" since the mass matrix ( which is especially clear in the nonstrange - strange quark basis ) reveals that @xmath210 induces the mixing between the nonstrange isoscalar @xmath211 and @xmath126 quark - antiquark states .",
    "equivalently , @xmath210 can be viewed as being generated by the transitions among the @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath126 pseudoscalar states ; via quark loops , these pseudoscalar @xmath214 bound states can annihilate into gluons which in turn via another quark loop can again recombine into another pseudoscalar @xmath215 bound state of the same or different flavor .",
    "the quantity @xmath197 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ secondu1amass ] ) is then the annihilation strength of such transitions , in the limit of an exact su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "( the realistic breaking of this symmetry is easily introduced and improves our description of the @xmath29-@xmath30 complex considerably . )",
    "the `` diamond '' graph in fig .",
    "4 gives just the simplest example of such an annihilation / recombination transition . since these annihilations occur in the nonperturbative regime of qcd , all graphs with any even number of gluons instead of just those two in fig .",
    "4 , can be just as significant in annihilating and forming a @xmath216 pseudoscalar @xmath214 meson . indeed , this nonperturbative @xmath0 mass scale , eq .",
    "( [ secondu1amass ] ) , is still 3 times higher than the gluon `` diamond '' graph evaluated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "thus , we can not calculate @xmath217 and the situation is much more complicated and less clear than in the abelian case , where we have seen , in sec .",
    "2.c , that pvv , the quark triangle graph with pseudoscalar coupling , reproduces the effect of the axial anomaly , i.e. , the wz lagrangian term , or equivalently , the effect of the anomalous term @xmath218 in the divergence ( [ divaanom ] ) of the current @xmath219 .",
    "can it then be founded to think that the annihilation graphs with the pseudoscalar meson - quark coupling , such as the `` diamond '' graph in fig .",
    "4 , give rise to the anomalous term @xmath220 in the divergence ( [ divganom ] ) of the su(3)-singlet current @xmath221 , and thus ultimately to the large mass of @xmath222 ( and of the observed @xmath30 ) ?",
    "well , this conjecture may remain a speculation since we can not calculate @xmath197 due to the nonperturbative nature of the problem . nevertheless , when we use it in our approach as a parameter with the value given by eq .",
    "( [ secondu1amass ] ) , we obtain a very good description of the @xmath29-@xmath30 complex phenomenology @xcite .",
    "this includes not only the masses of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but also their @xmath223 decay widths , and the mixing angle @xmath224 consistently following from the masses and @xmath223 widths .",
    "this gives a strong motivation for the above conjecture .",
    "pseudoscalar @xmath225 is coupled to a quark loop , whereby it can annihilate into gluons which in turn recombine into the pseudoscalar @xmath226 having the flavor content @xmath227.,height=249 ]      we should also note that our conjecture in the previous subsection goes well with the arguments of banerjee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , that there is really no strong cp problem .",
    "they find that one does _ not _ need vanishing @xmath228 ( where @xmath229 is the quark mass matrix ) .",
    "thus , one does not need any fine - tuning , and all cp violation in the qcd lagrangian can be avoided by having @xmath230 in its cp - violating term @xmath231 this term in the qcd lagrangian breaks the @xmath0 symmetry and corresponds to the anomalous term @xmath232 in the divergence ( [ divganom ] ) of the singlet current .",
    "the term ( [ thetaqcd ] ) is allowed by gauge invariance and renormalizability , but apparent nonexistence of the strong cp violation , and also of axions , is the solid reason to have it vanishing . our conjecture , that p - coupled annihilation graphs reproduce the effect of the gluon abj anomaly , naturally agrees with the vanishing of this term and with putting the case of the strong cp problem to rest _  la _ banerjee _ et al .",
    "we have presented and surveyed in detail the method of pseudoscalar coupling of pseudoscalar mesons to the  triangle \" and  box \" quark loops .",
    "we have reviewed how this method gives the equivalent results to the anomaly calculations .",
    "the p - coupling method has also been illustrated on the example of many decay amplitudes .",
    "the avv anomaly @xcite involves 10 invariant amplitudes ( reduced to 1 or 2 amplitudes for @xmath99 decay using additional ward identities ) .",
    "if instead one considers the pvv transition with a pseudoscalar coupling , then the pvv quark triangle amplitude is finite and leads to many decay amplitudes ( over 15 ) then in agreement with data to within 3% and not involving free parameters @xcite . to solve instead the former avv decay problem , very light axion bosons",
    "have been predicted but have _ not _ yet been observed @xcite .    also , there is the @xmath0 and @xmath233 problem involving gluons whereby strong interaction qcd leads to cp violation , definitely a `` strong cp problem '' because cp violation is known to occur at the @xmath234 weak interaction amplitude level @xcite .",
    "physicists have tried to circumvent this `` @xmath0  strong cp problem '' either via the topology of gauge fields or by investigating the @xmath233vacuum for this strong cp problem @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have circumvented the need to deal directly with the above photon or gluon avv anomalies by studying instead ( finite ) pvv quark triangle graphs .",
    "then we have given our phenomenological results  which always are in approximate agreement with the data .",
    "next we return to the @xmath0 problem and again use quark triangle diagrams coupled to 2 gluons . invoking nonstrange ",
    "strange particle mixing , the predicted @xmath0 mass is within 3% of data @xcite .",
    "thus we circumvent both photon and , admittedly on a much more speculative level , also the gluon abj anomaly without resorting either to unmeasured axions or to a strong cp violating term in the qcd lagrangian .",
