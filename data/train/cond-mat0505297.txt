    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in double - well trap @xcite and optical lattice @xcite has stimulated active research into various aspects of quantum tunneling phenomena such as the josephson junction @xcite , atomic interferometry @xcite , the two - wire waveguide @xcite , etc .",
    "dalfovo @xcite suggested a josephson like effect by considering a confining potential with two wells separated by a barrier .",
    "a difference between the chemical potentials of the atoms in the two traps can be achieved , for example , by loading a different number of atoms in the traps .",
    "the first experimental evidence @xcite of the oscillating atom current was observed instead in an one - dimensional josephson junction array realized with condensates in a laser standing wave , i.e. , an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the latest techniques of coherently splitting the condensate by deforming the single optical trap into two wells serve as a model system for tunneling in the condensate and provide a perfect demonstration of a trapped - atom interferometer @xcite .",
    "the coherent tunneling of bec between double - well traps results in the level splitting of the macroscopic ground state and hence the macroscopic coherence , which has been observed in interference experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , the energy - band structure and level splitting due to quantum tunneling in two weakly linked condensates in the  phase  representation have been evaluated in terms of the periodic instanton method @xcite , which manifests itself as a powerful tool for the calculation of the tunneling rate and a good approximation for the dilute boson gas @xcite .",
    "it , nevertheless , is not able to explicitly take into account the nonlinear interaction term in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) describing the atom - atom collisions in bec @xcite .",
    "it is naturally expected that as the number density of atoms in the condensates increases , the effect of the nonlinear interaction between atoms would become important . in the present paper",
    "we solve the gpe numerically in order to have a quantitative evaluation of the energy level splitting of the ground state for bec confined in a symmetric double - well trap and an optical lattice and explore the dependence of the energy level splitting on the chemical potential and the @xmath0-wave scattering length between atoms .",
    "although the numerical solution of gpe has been developed into a standard procedure , this never prevents us from seeking efficient analytical methods .",
    "the advantage of a nonperturbative method is that it gives not only an good description of the tunneling phenomena but also a comprehensive physical understanding in the context of quantum field theory .",
    "the periodic instanton configurations , which have been shown to be a useful tool in several areas of research such as spin tunneling , bubble nucleation and string theory , enable also the investigation of the finite temperature behavior of these systems . in the case of the bose - einstein system",
    ", it turns out that the periodic instanton method is reliable in evaluating the tunnel splitting for bec trapped in both the double - well and optical lattice in the regime of experimental values of the chemical potential and scattering length .",
    "the intention of this paper is to quantitatively compare the deviation of the instanton result from the exact numerical solution and to address the applicability of the instanton method to actual experimental situations .",
    "we restricted our discussion to a quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) bec since it is mathematically simple , in which the bec is prepared in optical and magnetic traps by putting atoms in cylindrical traps long enough that the one - particle energy - level spacing in the radial direction exceeds the interatomic - interaction energy , and the atoms can move effectively in the axial direction @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief review of the mean - field analysis for bec trapped in external potentials . in sec .",
    "iii the energy level splitting is derived in terms of the instanton method based on the gpe with , however , the nonlinear interaction term included implicitly in the chemical potential . in sec .",
    "iv we present the numerical procedure for solving the gpe and evaluation of the ground state level splitting .",
    "the numerical level splitting is compared with the instanton result in sec .",
    "v and a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "we are interested in the macroscopic quantum tunneling between the condensates separated by potential barriers and the main concern here is how the nonlinear interaction between the atoms would affect the level splitting .",
    "we begin with the energy functional for the condensed bosons of mass @xmath1 confined in the external potential @xmath2 given by @xmath3\\ ] ] where the order parameter of the condensate @xmath4 are normalized to the number of atoms in the condensate @xmath5 and the 1d effective interaction constant @xmath6 @xcite characterizes the nonlinear interaction in the condensate through @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath7 . here",
    "the radial extension of the ground state wavefunction @xmath8 is a typical length scale in the transverse trap with a confinement frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the first - order variation of the energy functional leads to the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , @xmath10 , with the chemical potential @xmath11 calculated as the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath12 the transverse confinement frequency @xmath9 should be large compared with @xmath13 so that the condensate is prepared in one dimension . on the other hand , for a less strong transverse confinement , atoms will oscillate in all directions which makes the model not exactly solvable . as can be seen in the last part of the paper , tunneling",
    "would be greatly enhanced in 3d .",
    "consider two models of the external potential where atoms can tunnel through the barriers .",
    "the double - well trapping potential of the form @xmath14 allows us to investigate the interwell coupling which results in the splitting of the energy level .",
    "the potential barrier of depth @xmath15between the two minima @xmath16 is assumed to be large enough so that the overlap between the wave functions relative to the two traps occurs only in the classically forbidden region where the interaction can be ignored .",
    "the optical lattice trapping potential @xmath17 on the other hand , formed by the standing wave laser beams with wavevector @xmath18 @xcite , simulates the sine - gordon potential which is widely used in quantum field theory as a periodic field model @xcite . quantum tunneling between many wells leads to the formation of energy bands due to the spatially periodic potential ( [ ol ] ) .",
    "a path integral calculation @xcite was done for these quantum tunneling models both for vacuum and excited states neglecting , however , the nonlinear interaction . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the nonlinear interaction between the atoms was included in the finite chemical potential and we realized that tunneling occurs at the level of chemical potential",
    ". here we will solve the gpe numerically and compare the numerical results with the analytical ones .",
    "for convenience we rescale the energies and distances in units of @xmath19 and oscillator lengths @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the frequency of small oscillations at the bottom of each well @xmath22 in double - well or optical lattice traps . the wave function is correspondingly rescaled in units of @xmath23  so that it remains normalized to @xmath24 .",
    "the gpe thus takes the following dimensionless form @xmath25 \\psi \\left ( x\\right ) = \\mu \\psi \\left ( x\\right )    \\label{gpe}\\ ] ] with the potential barrier @xmath26 and chemical potential @xmath27 measured in units of @xmath28 and the nonlinear interaction parameter becomes @xmath29 .",
    "futhermore , we fix the potential parameters as @xmath30 and @xmath31 in order to leave us with only one adjustable parameter , i.e. , the potential depth @xmath26 . the tunnel splitting depends on these parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are effectively the separations between the well bottoms , in a similar way as on @xmath26 . in the case of an optical lattice , the depth of the barrier",
    "is usually measured in units of the recoil energy @xmath34 of the atoms .",
    "it is , however , not difficult to transfer the energy units between this convention and ours .",
    "quantum tunneling between noninteracting particles localized in two adjacent wells with macroscopic wave functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 leads to an effective energy level splitting @xmath37 , which removes the asymptotic degeneracy .",
    "the wave functions of the ground state @xmath38 with even parity and the first excited state @xmath39 with odd parity are superpositions of the localized wave functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath40 @xmath41 with energy eigenvalues @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "when the interatomic coupling constant @xmath43 vanishes , the problem reduces to the solution of a linear schrndinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath44 . the nonlinear interaction increases the chemical potential and even for the system at zero temperature",
    ", tunneling occurs at a higher level @xmath27 than the ground state .",
    "the tunnel splitting can be found with the instanton method @xcite and is generally expressed as @xmath45    \\label{sp}\\ ] ] where the imaginary time action @xmath46 is calculated through the barrier region ( @xmath47 ) once from turning point @xmath48 to turning point @xmath49 : @xmath50 and the frequency @xmath51 appearing in the prefactor is the frequency of the classical periodic oscillations at energy @xmath52 in the classically accessible region with the boundary determined by the turning points @xmath49 and @xmath53 @xmath54 the path integral method @xcite has been used in the evaluation of the tunneling rate prefactor and the barrier @xmath26 between two wells is assumed to be high enough to safely use the wkb wave functions @xcite in the calculation of the transition amplitude . for the potential in the form of ( [ dw ] ) the level splitting reduces to @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the complete jacobian elliptic integral of the first and second kinds respectively .",
    "the corresponding parameters are defined as @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "when the nonlinear interaction vanishes , the dimensionless chemical potential reduces to @xmath61 and the above result turns out to be @xmath62 which resembles the case of the vacuum instanton .",
    "tunneling between many potential wells splits the level further into as many sublevels as the number of wells .",
    "the bloch theorem tells us that the eigenvalues of the periodic potential exhibits an energy band structure in the tight - binding approximation @xmath63 with @xmath37 the band width of the quantum state with energy @xmath27 . here",

    "we always measured energies in units of @xmath28 and lengths in units of the oscillator length @xmath102 , so @xmath26 is all we need .    as a comparison we first of all deal with the `` noninteracting ''  case . when @xmath103 , the analytical tunnel splitting of the instanton approach given in eq .",
    "( [ spdw ] ) is @xmath104 and our numerical result is @xmath105 .",
    "this again proves the validity of our numerical simulation .",
    "the corresponding wave function is shown in fig .",
    "in this paper we are mainly interested in the ground state , and for this purpose the choice of @xmath87 is seen to be adequate for most of the calculations . in fig .",
    "1b we show the profiles of the even ( solid line)- and odd ( dotted line ) wave functions _  _",
    "@xmath106 for 344 atoms confined in the trap with height @xmath103 , which are the even- and odd- eigenstates of the hamiltonian with the nonlinear interaction term @xmath107 .",
    "also the thomas - fermi approximation @xmath108 ^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath109 is given by the dashed lines .",
    "now we turn to examine the difference of level splitting obtained from the instanton method and the numerical simulation for the double - well trap . in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath37 on a logarithmic scale to base 10 as a function of the chemical potential is depicted for barrier heights , @xmath110 and @xmath103",
    ". results from both the numerical simulation ( solid line ) and instanton approach ( dotted line ) exhibit an enhancement of the tunneling with increasing chemical potential . to show how large the difference is , in the insets , we plot the splitting divided by the exponential factor of the analytical result .",
    "the results of the two approaches always have the same order of magnitude and are close to each other .",
    "the periodic instanton method evaluates fairly well the tunneling splitting even if the nonlinear interaction is included .",
    "quantitatively , however , it always over - estimates the splitting for the whole range of the chemical potential .",
    "these can be seen more clearly from the interacting constant @xmath43 dependence of the level splitting displayed in fig . 3 and its inset for @xmath103 .",
    "we emphasize here that a peculiar feature of this periodic instanton result for the level splitting is that the prefactor depends on the chemical potential as displayed in the insets of fig .",
    "this result is important , as has been shown in @xcite .    for the case of the optical lattice potential we still choose the same parameters as in the case of the double - well .",
    "the nonlinear interaction constant between atoms in the same well , @xmath101 for the repulsive interaction .",
    "the typical profile of the condensate wave function @xmath111 , shown by the solid line , and @xmath112 , shown by the dotted lines , are plotted in fig . 4 for @xmath103 and 150 atoms in each well .",
    "the even wave function is symmetric , and the odd wave function is maximally antisymmetric , i.e. , the wavefunction segment in each well is antisymmetric with respect to those of its neighbors . fig . 5a and 5b display the chemical potential dependence of the level splitting for @xmath103 and @xmath113 , as determined by the method outlined above .",
    "again , we find the results from the periodic instanton method and gpe have the same order of magnitude .    by comparing fig . 2 and fig .",
    "5 , it is shown that when the nonlinear interaction between atoms is included , the level splitting is smaller than the instanton result in the double - well case , but the splitting is larger in the optical lattice case .",
    "this distinction depends on the structure of the trapping potentials , for example , atoms in the optical lattice can tunnel through the barrier in two directions , while the tunnel path for those in the double - well is one - way only .",
    "this makes the periodic instanton result different from the double well case . in spite of this , the periodic instanton method remains good enough to describe the level splitting for the bec .",
    "recently a single bosonic josephson junction @xcite has been implemented by two weakly linked bec in a double - well potential . in previously reported realizations of condensates in double - well potentials",
    "@xcite the time scale of tunneling dynamics was in the range of thousands of seconds .",
    "in contrast , their setup allows the realization of nonlinear tunneling times on the order of @xmath114ms , which makes the direct observation of the nonlinear dynamics in a single bosonic josephson junction possible for the first time .",
    "we emphasize here the distinction between tunneling in 3d and that in quasi-1d systems .",
    "the important parameter , the `` tunneling matrix element '' @xmath115 @xcite between two condensates is related to the energy level splitting through @xmath116 . the period of oscillation @xmath117 can be obtained by numerically integrating eq . ( 1 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite for each given parameter @xmath118 . in the 3d case",
    ", @xmath115 is often assumed to be of the order @xmath119nk or @xmath120hz , which gives a relative small value for @xmath121 .",
    "in contrast , in the 1d case , the tight confinement in the other 2 directions would suppress drastically the tunneling and make the link between the condensates even weaker . according to our calculation",
    "the parameter @xmath115 obviously takes typical values of @xmath122hz and @xmath123 may be as large as @xmath124 . as a consequence ,",
    "the atoms tend to be trapped in the potential wells and the observation of josephson oscillation becomes almost impossible , e.g. , the initial population imbalance must be less than @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that for @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath103 , the josephson oscillation may be observed with a period @xmath129ms , which is less than that in the 3d experiments .    according to our calculation",
    ", the energy splitting is very small compared with the chemical potential of the system and increases exponentially with the chemical potential .",
    "the tunneling effect gives rise to the macroscopic phase coherence of bec across the barriers , which results in the significant observable interference phenomena between different bec segments .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the tunnel splitting of the ground state for a weakly - linked bec trapped in double - well potential and in optical lattice by solving the gross - pitaevskii equations numerically .",
    "it turns out that the periodic instanton method is a reliable tool in the evaluation of the tunnel splitting for the bec .",
    "the reason for this is that for the quantum tunneling  through the potential barrier , the nonlinear interaction is negligibly small and contributes overall to a finite chemical potential .",
    "our numerical scheme could easily be improved for the investigation of the dynamical behavior of the condensates in multi - well potentials .",
