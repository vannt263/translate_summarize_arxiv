    "collective synchronization of large populations of nonlinearly coupled phase oscillators has been intensely studied since winfree realized its importance for biological systems  @xcite and kuramoto gave mathematical form to these ideas in a simple model  @xcite .",
    "motivation for studying the kuramoto model can be found in the broad variety of physical , chemical or biological phenomena which can be modelled within its framework ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    the problem we want to consider is the dynamics of a system of nonlinearly , globally coupled phase oscillators with random frequencies @xmath0 [ the probability for an oscillator to have frequency @xmath1 is @xmath2 , subject to external ( independent , identically - distributed ) white noise sources @xmath3 ( of strength @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 denotes the _",
    "i_th oscillator phase , @xmath8 represents the coupling strength , and @xmath9 is a generic real function of periodicity @xmath10 . in fourier space , the latter",
    "can be decomposed as follows , @xmath11 with @xmath12",
    ".    important work on the kuramoto model with a general coupling function was carried out by daido  @xcite and crawford  @xcite among others .",
    "daido introduced the concept of order function to understand synchronization at zero temperature , @xmath13 .",
    "essentially , the order function is an average of the oscillator drift velocity on a rotating frame  @xcite . assuming a reasonable shape for the order function and the one - oscillator probability density ( supposedly stationary in the rotating frame ) , daido derived a functional equation for the order function .",
    "he then found solutions by direct numerical simulations and by bifurcation theory for stationary or rotating - wave probability densities .",
    "however , his theory is not sufficiently general to cover other possible probability densities ( e.g. , standing waves  @xcite ) nor to predict their stability properties .",
    "crawford considered the problem of constructing one - oscillator probability densities which bifurcate from the incoherent density @xmath14 ( for which an oscillator has the same probability to be at any given value of the angle @xmath15 )  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence of these works , different conjectures were proposed , both concerning scaling of bifurcating solution branches and general statements such as `` adding noise could actually yield an enhancement in the level of synchronization '' @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with these previous works is that explicit calculations were performed mostly near bifurcation points .",
    "one exception is daido s coupling function @xmath16 sign@xmath17 for which the calculation of the order function can be explicitly carried out .    in this paper",
    ", we shall introduce classes of coupling functions leading to drift terms which are _ local _ functions of the probability density .",
    "we restrict ourselves to oscillators without frequency disorder , i.e. , with frequency distribution @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding governing equations for the probability density ( in the limit of infinitely many oscillators ) are systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which are analyzed",
    ". then definite results can be proved about synchronization which do not depend on bifurcation calculations , order function theory or numerical simulations as much as the work of previous authors .",
    "together with singular perturbation calculations , our results can be used to give approximations to the one - oscillator probability density of models with disorder , in the limiting case of high - frequencies @xcite .",
    "the examples of singular coupling functions considered in this paper are the hard - needles ( + sign ) and stick - needles (  sign ) couplings , for which @xmath20 , the burgers coupling , @xmath21 , and the daido coupling ( extended burgers model ) , @xmath22 sign@xmath23 . in all cases ,",
    "these @xmath9 s are extended periodically outside the interval @xmath24 .",
    "we shall show that less singular couplings give rise to models for which the oscillators are easier to synchronize : ( i ) the hard - needles oscillators do not synchronize at any temperature ( the stick - needles coupling leads to ill - posed problems unless the temperature is large enough ) , ( ii ) the burgers oscillators may synchronize only at zero temperature ; even then , their probability density algebraically decays to incoherence as @xmath25 for large times , ( iii ) the oscillators with daido coupling may synchronize at any temperature , and the synchronized phases are described by explicitly - known order functions and probability densities .",
    "a first paper in the direction of these results was published by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec - general ] contains results which hold for general models with disorder in the natural frequencies .",
    "these include a derivation of the governing equations for the one - oscillator probability density , its moments and the moment - generating function .",
    "we establish a relationship between these objects and daido s order function showing that the latter is proportional to the average oscillator drift in a rotating frame .",
    "lastly , we give the leading - order form of the probability density in the limit of high frequencies . the density is a superposition of probability densities with zero natural frequency in rotating frames and with smaller coupling constants . in section",
    "[ sec - odd ] we extend daido s approach to the case of nonzero temperature , and find the form of the stationary solutions and a general liapunov functional for the case of odd coupling functions . in section [ sec - family ]",
    "we introduce the family of singular couplings to be studied .",
    "section [ sec - porous ] contains our analysis of the porous medium models which appear for the hard - needles and stick - needles couplings .",
    "we show that the hard - needles model is well - posed , its solution exists globally , and also that sharp time decay estimates towards its equilibrium can be obtained locally for any initial data or globally for small initial data evolving exponentially fast towards incoherence .",
    "the last result is proven by different methods according to whether we allow the temperature to be zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the stick - needles model is ill - posed for low enough temperature .",
    "section [ sec - burgers ] is devoted to study a model with burgers coupling .",
    "we adapt well - known results to the case of periodic boundary conditions to show that the probability density of the burgers oscillators may tend to a state different from incoherence only if the temperature is zero . in section [ sec - daido ]",
    "we analyze the extended burgers model resulting from the daido coupling @xmath16 sign@xmath23 .",
    "we first show that finding the probability density is equivalent to solving two coupled nonlinear parabolic equations for the drift @xmath26 and a certain functional of the probability density , @xmath27 .",
    "then we find families of stationary solutions in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "these solutions bifurcate supercritically from incoherence at couplings @xmath28 which are proportional to the squares of odd integer numbers , and stationary densities on the first bifurcating branch are stable at least for small enough @xmath28 .",
    "we discuss some of the results of previous authors in the light of our exact calculations .",
    "the appendices discuss technical matters related to the bulk of the article .",
    "in this section we consider general aspects of the model ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "first of all , we use the moment approach considered in @xcite to derive a nonlinear fokker - planck equation ( nlfpe ) for the one - oscillator probability density in the limit of infinitely many oscillators .",
    "the moment approach exploits the symmetry of the dynamical problem we are interested in , so is a good starting point to deal with the kuramoto model which has rotational symmetry ( an extension of this method to deal with tops has been considered in @xcite ) . secondly , we characterize phase and frequency synchronization generalizing to @xmath29 the concept of order function introduced by daido @xcite for oscillator synchronization at @xmath13 .",
    "lastly , we show that , at high frequencies , the probability density can be decomposed into @xmath30 components rotating steadily at the frequencies of the peaks of a given multimodal natural frequency distribution .",
    "each component probability density solves a nlfpe with zero natural frequency ( in the rotating frame ) and a modified coupling constant .",
    "this latter results follows immediately from the method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the usual kuramoto model with a sinusoidal coupling function .",
    "this result can be combined with the exact solutions obtained in later sections to yield analytic expressions of synchronized phases in models with frequency disorder and white noise forcing _ in the high - frequency limit_.      to start with let us define , @xmath31 where the brackets denote average with respect to the external noise and the overbar average with respect to the random oscillator frequency .",
    "this set of moments is invariant under the local symmetry @xmath32 which is the symmetry of the dynamical equations [ eq1 ] .",
    "the equation of motion for the moments reads @xmath33 it is easy to derive from eq.([eq4 ] ) the following differential equation @xmath34 + t\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}-\\frac{\\partial^2 g } { \\partial x\\partial y } \\ , \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] for the generating function @xmath35 the velocity @xmath26 is defined by @xmath36 and it can be equivalently written as a convolution between the coupling and the generating function ( see [ app : a ] ) : @xmath37 notice that this drift velocity is related to daido s order function @xmath38  @xcite ( see [ app : b ] ) : @xmath39    the case analyzed by kuramoto corresponds to the force @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 and the rest of components are zero .",

    "we can relate the probability density to the moment - generating function as follows : @xmath48 }   = { 1\\over n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n } e^{y\\omega_{j } } \\delta(\\phi_{j}(t ) - x)\\nonumber\\\\ = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } e^{y\\omega}\\,\\rho(x,\\omega ,",

    "we show the different bifurcation branches which occur at different integer values of @xmath438 .",
    "an alternative calculation of the first branch ( index @xmath495 ) of stationary solutions bifurcating from incoherence is using monte carlo methods .",
    "they are quite powerful since acceptance rate can be tuned at will in such a way that the approach to the stationary state may be faster .",

    "@xmath563 which is equivalent to @xmath564 if we prove that @xmath565 evolves towards zero as @xmath566 , @xmath567 , then this implies that the density ( [ hyperst2 ] ) is linearly stable . but",
    "analyzing equation ( [ hyperlin3 ] ) as a heat equation with respect to @xmath165 , with boundary conditions @xmath568 as @xmath569 , we have the green function of the linear part @xmath570 using the periodicity and symmetry properties of @xmath53 and @xmath352 , the solution can be written in convolution form with respect to @xmath165 with initial data @xmath571 .",

    "each component corresponds to the solution of a nlfpe with zero natural frequency , on a frame rotating with fixed angular velocity .",
    "which results do we know for such a reduced zero - frequency nlfpe ?    in section",
    "[ sec - odd ] , we have shown that a liapunov functional of the free energy type exists for a class of odd coupling functions ( zero natural frequency )",
    ". then the probability density evolves towards a stable stationary function . which stationary function",
    "this is , depends on @xmath113 .",
    "we have analyzed a family of singular coupling functions for which the nlfpe reduces to partial differential equations or systems thereof , such as the porous media equation , the burgers equation or systems of burgers equations .",
    "for these equations , we have examined the behavior of their solutions in the limit of large times for different temperatures ; see section [ sec - family ] for details . the most interesting coupling function , @xmath573 sign @xmath17 ( periodically extended outside @xmath255 $ ] ) , was already studied by daido in the case of zero temperature , @xmath13 ( see section [ sec - general].2 for a rephrasing of his assumptions and results ) .",
    "this model is capable of synchronization at any temperature .",
    "we have found exact formulas for stationary synchronized probability densities which bifurcate supercritically from incoherence .",
    "although we have not been able to determine their linear stability , we know that the first bifurcating branch of solutions is stable at least for coupling parameter near the bifurcation point .",
    "let us assume that this bifurcating branch is always stable for coupling parameter above the bifurcation value .",
    "we can combine our results to obtain the stable probability density for a model with a multimodal natural frequency distribution in the high - frequency limit .",
    "we find that , except for a constant shift in @xmath17 , the stable probability density is @xmath574 where @xmath575 is the heaviside unit step function . in these equations , @xmath576 is the solution ( [ eb14 ] ) corresponding to setting @xmath495 and @xmath577 instead of @xmath28 in ( [ eb11 ] ) .",
    "the overall velocity function ( proportional to daido s order function ) is a superposition of rotating waves correponding to the contributions of the synchronized components @xmath578 here @xmath579 is the value of @xmath30 obtained by substituting @xmath495 and @xmath577 instead of @xmath28 in ( [ eb11 ] ) .",
    "to obtain the convolution identity ( [ conv ] ) , we can write the velocity @xmath26 as follows @xmath580 which , using the expression for @xmath144 @xmath581 gives the announced relationship ( [ conv ] ) .",
