    "<S> _ discovered that a slight modification of standard percolation on a complete graph turns the continuous transition into an abrupt one  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising phenomenon , marketed as `` explosive percolation '' , attracted a lot of attention and was studied on scale - free networks  @xcite , regular two - dimensional lattices  @xcite , and in various other situations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initially the explosive transition was believed to be discontinuous , but later studies revealed that the transition is extremely sudden but actually continuous@xcite .    while in ordinary bond percolation each bond is set independently with probability  @xmath0 , the achlioptas process uses a dynamical procedure , where the bonds are placed in sequence . to this end one randomly selects two pairs of neighboring lattice sites which are not yet connected by a bond . depending on the actual bond configuration , </S>",
    "<S> a weight is assigned to each of the pairs by multiplying the sizes of the clusters to which the two lattice sites belong ( or squaring the size if both sites belong to the same cluster ) . if the weights of the two pairs are different , the pair with the _ lower _ weight is connected by a new bond . otherwise , if the weights are equal , one of the pairs is randomly chosen and connected . </S>",
    "<S> this process is repeated until the density of bonds exceeds the value of the control parameter @xmath0 .    </S>",

    "<S> two vacant bonds @xmath1 ( shown as dashed lines ) are randomly selected . as bond @xmath2 would connect two clusters of sizes 2 and 4 </S>",
    "<S> , its weight is @xmath3 , whereas bond @xmath4 has the weight @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the bond with the _ lower _ weight is set and the procedure is repeated until the density of bonds exceeds the parameter  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> right : `` explosive '' ising model with two spin domains ( red and green ) . here a swendsen - wang update uses the same dynamical rule for placing bonds but only within domains of equally oriented spins . </S>",
    "<S> , width=340 ]    as the dynamic rule is defined in such a way that new connections are preferentially added between _ small _ clusters , it is plausible that the transition point is shifted to higher values of the percolation probability . </S>",
    "<S> for example , on a two - dimensional square lattice , where the transition of ordinary bond percolation takes place at @xmath6 , the achlioptas - dynamics described above shifts the transition point to @xmath7  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the transition is not only shifted , but it changes also qualitatively , exhibiting a sudden transition , where a large percolation cluster is formed . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the transition is called `` explosive '' .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the concept of explosive cluster growth can also be applied successfully to kinetic spin models with cluster dynamics . here </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on a particularly simple case , namely , the two - dimensional ising model with swendsen - wang dynamics  @xcite . as will be shown below </S>",
    "<S> , the use of an explosive cluster dynamics turns the continuous ising transition in a discontinuous one , preserving the @xmath8-symmetry of the model . as this modification of the dynamics </S>",
    "<S> is expected to break detailed balance , the stationary state of such an explosive ising model will no longer be an equilibrium state . + </S>",
    "<S> * definition of the model : * + before defining the explosive ising model let us briefly recall the swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithm applied to the ising model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sw cluster algorithm is a dynamical update rule which works as follows . at first percolation clusters </S>",
    "<S> are grown _ within _ the actual spin clusters . for each of these clusters </S>",
    "<S> one chooses a random number @xmath9 which is then assigned to all its spins . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , in case of the ising model the sw update for a given configuration of spins consists of the following steps :    * remove all bonds . * set all bonds between equally oriented nearest - neighbor spins with probability @xmath0 . * </S>",
    "<S> identify all clusters of sites which are connected by bonds . </S>",
    "<S> * for each of these clusters generate a random number @xmath9 with equal probability and assign it to all its spins .    </S>",
    "<S> it was proven that this dynamics evolves into the equilibrium state of the ising model without critical - slowing - down and that the percolation probability is related to the temperature by @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now modify the sw dynamics of the ising model by replacing ordinary with explosive percolation . </S>",
    "<S> since bonds can no longer be distributed independently , one first has to determine the number of potential bonds @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this results into the following `` explosive '' swendsen - wang dynamics for the ising model ( see right panel of fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> both models are in the disordered phase , although the domains in the explosive variant seem to be somewhat smaller . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 is increased , the ising model displays a continuous transition at @xmath14 into a partially ordered state , while the explosive variant switches suddenly to an almost completely ordered state at some value between 0.57 and 0.58 ( see below ) . </S>",

    "<S> however , the explosive cluster dynamics is part of a continually repeating update procedure , allowing one to increase and decrease the percolation probability while the model evolves in time .    </S>",
    "<S> since a spin model with cluster dynamics switches frequently from positive to negative magnetization in the ordered phase , the appropriate order parameter is the absolute value of the magnetization @xmath20 . the solid lines in fig .  [ fig : hysteresis ] show how @xmath18 varies with the control parameter @xmath0 on a lattice with @xmath21 sites and periodic boundary conditions . </S>",

    "<S> the achlioptas selection rule generates smaller clusters than in the usual ising model . </S>",
    "<S> since the percolation clusters are confined to domains of the same spin orientation , their growth is suppressed like in a finite system with open boundary conditions , explaining why nothing happens at the usual threshold @xmath25 of explosive percolation . however , as the size of the ising domains grows with @xmath0 , one eventually reaches a point @xmath23 where this stabilization mechanism breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> here one observes the immediate formation of a system - spanning cluster , self - sustained from inside by the as from now super - critical achlioptas process . </S>",
    "<S> lowering @xmath0 again the system first remains in the ordered state until the explosive percolation transition is reached from above . </S>",
    "<S> as the percolation process takes place on a slightly porous support , the transition point is already reached at a value @xmath22 which is somewhat higher than the usual transition point of explosive percolation @xmath26 .    </S>",

    "<S> middle : distribution of the order parameter averaged over long time for various values of @xmath0 in a @xmath27 system . </S>",
    "<S> right : the average time @xmath29 between two flips at @xmath28 grows exponentially with the system size.,width=604 ]    * spontaneous flipping and order parameter distribution : * + as usual in systems with a first - order phase transition , we find that the order parameter in finite systems flips occasionally between the disordered and the ordered phase ( left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : flipping ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the corresponding probability distributions of the order parameter ( see central panel ) show two maxima separated by a valley , whose relative sizes depend on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also verified that the flipping time @xmath29 diverges exponentially with the number of sites @xmath30 , meaning that the ordered and the disordered phase are both thermodynamically stable in the coexistence region @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> * density of equally oriented neighbors at the transition flanks : * + let @xmath32 be the total number of bonds generated in the update procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we finally present the surprising conjecture that the global bond density @xmath33 is exactly equal to @xmath26 at the left transition flank in the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , a similar relation holds at the transition point of the _ ordinary _ ising model on a square lattice  @xcite . to see this </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the number @xmath11 of equally oriented neighboring spins , which is related to the internal energy @xmath34 by @xmath35 where @xmath36 the lowest possible energy where all spins are parallel . as bonds are randomly set between equally oriented spins with probability @xmath0 , we have @xmath37 so that the global bond density is given by @xmath38 since the internal energy of the ising model on a square lattice at the critical point @xmath39 is known to be @xmath40 , we find that @xmath41 this means that the transition in the ordinary ising model with swendsen - wang dynamics takes place when the global bond density reaches the value @xmath42  the same value as the critical threshold for percolation _ without _ ising spins . </S>",
    "<S> the actual transition point @xmath43 is of course larger since bonds between different spin clusters can not be set so that an enhanced probability is needed to reach a global bond density of @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> left : global bond density @xmath44 set during the sw update as a function of the percolation probability @xmath0 in the ordinary ising model ( left ) and the explosive variant ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal dotted lines indicate where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=453 ]    surprisingly , we find numerically that the same relation holds at the left transition flank of the explosive ising model , where the bond density @xmath47 reaches the value @xmath48 of explosive percolation without ising spins ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : bonddens ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the right flank the transition occurs at a lower value @xmath49 which may tend to @xmath42 in the limit of very large lattices .    * concluding remarks : * + in this letter we introduced and studied an explosive variant of the ising model , arriving at two conjectures :    * even though the achlioptas - process was found to be continuous , we think that the transition in the explosive ising model is genuinely discontinuous because it exhibits a very clear hysteresis . * the global density of bonds in the sw update at the left transition flank of the hysteresis is conjectured to be equal to the threshold @xmath48 of explosive percolation without ising spins . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous relation holds already for the usual ising model . at the right transition </S>",
    "<S> flank the bond density is lower , probably close to @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to explore these conjectures more deeply and to apply similar ideas to other spin systems with cluster dynamics .    </S>",
