    "typically , the rate function in a large deviations regime will depend on the distribution of the underlying random variables , while a mdp inherits properties of both the central limit behaviour as well as the large deviation principle : the speed of convergence to zero of the probability of an untypical event usually is exponential while the rate function does not depend on the fine structure of the underlying distribution .",

    "under further assumptions on the dynamical system one can apply a stronger version of birkhoff s theorem ( see @xcite ) , which states pointwise convergence against a constant instead of @xmath61-almost sure convergence .",

    "one defines for every @xmath77 $ ] the class of @xmath61-integrable functions @xmath78 we get the following theorem .",
    "[ moderate deviations for the dynamic random walk under the quenched measure ] [ thmmdpdyn ] suppose that @xmath79 and @xmath80 . then for all @xmath81 , @xmath82 obeys a mdp with speed @xmath83 rate function @xmath84",

    "but the situation for @xmath106 , i.e. multiple minima of @xmath92 , seems not to be well understood as we try to outline in the following : in @xcite ellis and newman proved a law of large numbers ( for the curie - weiss model with constant external field ) , i.e. they showed that the mean magnetization converges weakly to a linear combination of the minima of maximal type of @xmath92 , whose weights can be written explicitly in terms of the types and strenghts of the corresponding minima . on the other hand ,",

    "a.1 ) by means of convex analysis , that the set of global minimizers of @xmath92 coincides with the set of zeros of the ldp rate function .",
    "this general theorem can also be applied to the curie - weiss model with dynamical external field and yields coincidence of the set of zeros of the above ldp rate function ( [ ratefunction ] ) and the set of minimizers of @xmath92 .",
    "astonishingly , in the treatment of the curie - weiss model with dynamical external field in @xcite , the authors claimed that the mean magnetization does not converge in distribution in the case of multiple minima of @xmath92 .",
    "nevertheless , they proved exponential equivalence of @xmath56 to a linear combination of the minimizers of @xmath92 , i.e. for every continuous bounded function @xmath107 , the expectation of @xmath108 under @xmath36 is equivalent , as @xmath25 goes to infinity , to @xmath109 for details on the @xmath25-dependent weights @xmath110 see th . 3.2 in @xcite .",
