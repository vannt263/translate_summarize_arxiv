    "the problem of community detection in complex networks has recently attracted the attention of researchers in different areas of scientific knowledge .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is a common practice to represent some complex systems as networks constituted by interconnected nodes .",
    "a network @xmath0 is defined by a set of nodes \\{n } ( @xmath1 , @xmath2, ... ,@xmath3 . ) , and a set of links \\{l } ( @xmath4 a link @xmath5 denotes a relation between node @xmath6 and node @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the possible values of @xmath8 the resulting network can be of two types .",
    "if @xmath8 can only have the values 1 or 0 , we will call the network unweighted , on the other hand , a network will be defined as weighted if @xmath5 can attain values different from 0 or 1 , thus indicating that the relation between nodes is also characterized by a given strength . in this work",
    "we will focus on unweighted networks .",
    "we will assume that for every node @xmath6 there exists at least another node @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is different from 0 , moreover we will consider networks such that for every conceivable pair of nodes there will be a path ( i.e. a sequence of links \\{@xmath9 ) joining them , in such a case we say that we are dealing with connected networks .",
    "we will consider that the links are undirected i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "further on , we will focus on sparse networks for which the number of links in \\{l } , @xmath11 , is much less than the maximum possible number of links , @xmath12 given by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the total number of nodes in @xmath15 .",
    "generally , complex networks contain a large number of nodes and links , and it is often possible to decompose them into subgraphs called _ communities _ , selected according to a given criterion .",
    "a community is usually defined , qualitatively , as a subgraph of the network whose nodes are more connected among them than to nodes outside the subgraph barthelemy , newman1 .",
    "community detection has a wide range of applications .",
    "the partition of a network in communities might allow us to find an specific function naturally assigned to each community , as for example in the case of metabolic networks @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , community detection can help us to identify social groups in a social network or can be used to perform a coarse - graining reduction of the network to simplify subsequent analysis @xcite .",
    "there are many methods to decompose a network into communities , but the widely adopted in recent years is the one proposed by newman and girvan newman1 .",
    "these authors define a merit factor named _ modularity _ ( @xmath16 ) that quantifies the quality of a given @xmath17-subgraphs partition @xmath18 of the graph @xmath0 , where @xmath19 with @xmath20 if @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity measures the difference between the actual fraction of internal links in each subgraph with respect to the expected value of the same quantity , if nodes in the network are randomly connected keeping the degree of each one fixed .",
    "the best partition of the network is taken as the one that maximizes the modularity @xmath22 , in this way , the network partition problem is turned into an optimization one .",
    "modularity optimization is a hard problem due to the fact that the number of possible partitions of a network increases at least exponentially with its size .",
    "indeed , it has recently been proven that this problem is np - complete @xcite , and then , there is not a correct polynomial - time algorithm to solve it for networks of any size .",
    "many optimization algorithms have been developed , like simulated annealing @xcite , extrema optimization @xcite and spectral division @xcite , but all of them can only give an approximation to the optimum partition for large networks .    in this work , we do not introduce a new @xmath22 optimization algorithm , but we propose new merit factors for the calculation of the partition of networks into communities .",
    "the modularity @xmath22 is a _ non - local _ community definition in the sense that it is necessary to know general characteristics of the whole network in order to decide if a given subgraph of the network is a community . in a recent paper @xcite fortunato @xmath23 barthlemy",
    "have shown that this non - local character imposes a resolution limit , by which the minimal community size that can be detected , by modularity optimization , depends on global network parameters .",
    "then , @xmath22 optimization is not able to detect communities of size smaller than a given threshold .    in this work",
    "we use the weak and strong community definitions proposed by radicchi et al in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize their local character and introduce new merit factors to evaluate the quality of a given partition of a network based on these quantitative definitions of community .",
    "then , we implement an optimization method in the spirit of simulated annealing mad , ecra , in order to analyze different networks using these new merit factors and to show the characteristics of our approach .",
    "finally , we show that the resolution limit problem does not appear in our approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review the definitions introduced in @xcite and compare them with the modularity @xmath22 , we also analyze the meaning of this last quantity . in section [ merit ]",
    "we define the _ community strength _",
    "@xmath24 in the strong and weak sense and we introduce the associated merit factors . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we apply our method to different , well known , networks . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we analyze the resolution limit problem for our approach .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "when thinking about communities in networks we have in mind a qualitative community definition : _  a community is a group of nodes in which the number of internal links , connecting nodes within the group , is larger than the number of external ones_. in order to formalize this qualitative criterion we consider a graph @xmath0 containing @xmath14 nodes , with @xmath25 the degree of node @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a subgraph of @xmath0 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the number of links of node @xmath30 that connect it to nodes inside and outside of @xmath27 respectively .",
    "there are two quantitative community definitions introduced by radicchi et al @xcite :    * i ) community in strong sense : * _ @xmath27 is a community in the strong sense if : _ @xmath31    * ii ) community in weak sense : * _ @xmath27 is a community in weak sense if : _",
    "@xmath32    in words : a subgraph @xmath33 will be a community in the strong sense if each of its nodes has more links connecting it with nodes in @xmath27 than those that connect it with other nodes not belonging to @xmath27 . in a similar way",
    ", @xmath34 will be a community in the weak sense if the sum of the number of links that interconnect nodes inside @xmath27 is larger than the sum of all links that connect nodes in @xmath27 with nodes not belonging to @xmath27 .",
    "these community definitions are simple , intuitive and _ local _ : given a subgraph @xmath33 we can decide if it constitutes a community , in either strong or weak sense , without knowledge of the entire structure of @xmath0 .    in order to compare the previous approach with the one proposed in newman1 , we briefly review the definition and meaning of the modularity @xmath16 . given a @xmath17-subgraphs partition @xmath35 of the graph @xmath0 , where @xmath19 , the mathematical expression of @xmath16 is : @xmath36   \\label{eq1}\\]]where @xmath37 denotes the total number of internal links for subgraph @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the total number of links in @xmath0 .",
    "the term @xmath41 in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] denotes the actual fraction of internal links in subgraph @xmath42 , while @xmath43 can be interpreted as the probability of a link to be connected to a node in subgraph @xmath42 .",
    "then , @xmath44 is the expected fraction of links within subgraph @xmath42 when all nodes in @xmath0 are randomly connected keeping the degree of the nodes fixed . this last ideal random picture is used to compare with the actual one because it is assumed that corresponds to a situation with no communities ( although it was shown in @xcite that random networks may have a community structure ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the modularity @xmath22 was conceived as a measure of the goodness of a given partition of the network .",
    "then , the bigger @xmath22 is , the better the partition is .",
    "we should notice that this merit factor implies , in turn , a community definition ( which does not necessarily corresponds to the intuitive one stated above ) : a subgraph @xmath45 will be a community if the actual number of links that connects nodes in @xmath45 is bigger than the expected one when all nodes in the network are randomly connected , this is to say , when @xmath46 .",
    "clearly this last condition depends on the global parameter @xmath11 , then , we say that the community definition associated with @xmath22 is _ non - local_.    in what follows , we will introduce new merit factors associated with the weak and strong community definitions .      given a graph @xmath0 and a @xmath17-subgraphs partition @xmath35 , where each subgraph @xmath47 constitutes a community according to any of the local definitions mentioned in the previous section , we want to define a quantity that measures the quality  of each of the resulting communities . in the context of the above mentioned local framework ,",
    "this quantity must only depend on the local characteristics of the subgraph @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , our analysis must be circumscribed to nodes and links belonging to @xmath45 and external links that connect nodes in @xmath45 to nodes outside @xmath45 . following the weak and strong definitions of community ,",
    "the more internal links a community has , with respect to the external ones , the stronger  it will be . if @xmath48 is the degree of node @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the number of internal and external links for node @xmath52 , we define the _ community strength _ ( @xmath24 ) , that measures the normalized difference between internal and external links for nodes in @xmath45 :    @xmath53    were @xmath54 .",
    "then , @xmath55 , and it achieves its maximum value @xmath56 when @xmath57  @xmath58 .    the definition of @xmath59 according to eq . [ eq2 ] is valid for unweighted networks . in the case of weighted links",
    ", we have to interpret @xmath60 as the sum of the weights of the links that connect to node @xmath52 , for both @xmath28 and @xmath51 .",
    "now we introduce a merit factor @xmath61 for the weak community definition as the sum of @xmath59 over all subgraphs @xmath47 :    @xmath62    with the constraint that each subgraph @xmath63 must satisfy the weak community definition i.e.    @xmath64    as in the case of @xmath22 : the bigger @xmath61 is , the better the @xmath17-subgraphs partition @xmath35 of @xmath0 will be , in the sense of weak community definition .",
    "then , it is possible to implement the optimization algorithms developed for @xmath22 for this new merit factor @xmath65 ,    in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] , @xmath66  when all the network constitutes a single community .",
    "if as a result of the optimization process the maximum value obtained for @xmath61 is precisely @xmath66 and we get a single community , then the best partition of the graph corresponds to no partition .",
    "however , it is possible that one could get @xmath67  @xmath68  for a given @xmath17-subgraphs partition , with @xmath69 but with @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting community structure of network would correspond to a suboptimal partition .    in the same spirit",
    "we now define a merit factor @xmath71 according to the strong community definition :    @xmath72    with the constraint @xmath73    now , our definition of optimal partition can be stated in the following way :    * definition : * _ the optimal @xmath17-subgraphs partition @xmath35 of a graph @xmath0 in the strong ( weak ) sense is that one with maximal merit factor _",
    "@xmath71 _ _ ( _ _ @xmath61_)_.    in next section we will show some examples of the application of this new merit factors in network partition problems .",
    "in all examples presented in this section we have used an optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing , described in @xcite , but for our new merit factors .",
    "the optimization can be performed in two ways . in the first one the total number of communes",
    "is left as a free parameter and as a consequence the final number of communes is determined by the simulated annealing process . in the second one , the number of communes is taken as an extra constraint .",
    "we will always use the first approach unless it is explicitly stated that the number of communes is fixed .",
    "this last methodology might be used when the optimal number of communes is already known from the experiments as in the case of the zachary network .",
    "that appear misclassified . ]",
    "we will begin with a typical case : zachary s karate club @xcite , that has turned into an unavoidable example in publications about community structure .",
    "this network represents the relationships between members of a karate club at a university in the 1970s , and it has been shown that it has a strong community structure in many previous studies @xcite . applying the optimization algorithm for the weak community definition merit factor @xmath61 , we obtained , for the unweighted version of zachary network , a partition into three communities of sizes : @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) nodes , with a value of @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "when the number of communities was constrained to two , we obtained two communities of 17 nodes each one , with @xmath81 ( circles and squares in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this partition corresponds to the one observed by zachary with the exception of node @xmath82 that appear misclassified .    with this analysis we can know , in addition , the strength @xmath59 of each community @xmath45 in the network . for the best partition of the zachary network into three communities of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 ( @xmath83 ) nodes",
    ", we have : @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 with @xmath75 as the strongest community .",
    "on the other hand , the partition into two communities , is composed by two strong communities of @xmath74 nodes each one , with @xmath87 for each one .",
    "when we perform the community analysis using the strong community merit factor @xmath71 , we obtained two communities : @xmath75 with @xmath88 nodes ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath77 with @xmath78 nodes ( @xmath90 ) . in fig .",
    "fig1 can be observed that node 10 has one internal and one external link and this situation is not be allowed in the strong community definition .",
    "for this reason , the communities with @xmath74 and @xmath76 nodes are joined together .",
    "another testing example is the star network of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , consisting of two interconnected stars with @xmath91 nodes each one . in the weak community picture",
    "we obtain for the optimal community structure a partition into two communities of @xmath91 nodes each with a value of @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding strengths are @xmath93 ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and @xmath94 ( squares in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the difference in strength between the two communities is ascribed to the extra link that connects nodes @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "optimization we find an additional community containing nodes @xmath97 and @xmath98 with strength @xmath99 . ]",
    "we must notice that , in the same context , there is another partition with the same value of @xmath61 but composed by two communities with @xmath76 and @xmath100 nodes .",
    "this happens when node @xmath97 is moved from one community to the other in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "no partition was obtained when we use the strong community merit factor @xmath101 .",
    "this is due the fact that nodes @xmath97 and @xmath98 are singly connected and then the condition @xmath102 is not satisfied .",
    "when @xmath22 optimization was implemented , we obtained three communities : @xmath103 and @xmath77 with @xmath82 nodes each and @xmath79 with @xmath95 nodes , including nodes @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with strength @xmath104 which does not satisfy any of the quantitative community definitions reviewed in [ sec2 ] .",
    "another example is the ring network of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with @xmath105 nodes and @xmath106 .",
    "this network can not have a community structure due to its symmetry .",
    "however , we have obtained two communities of @xmath82 nodes each one , with strength @xmath107 by means of the weak merit factor optimization .",
    "we must notice here , that the found communities are not unique , that is to say , on having applied repeatedly the algorithm different communities of the same size but involving different sequences of node indexes are obtained .",
    "this is an evidence of the absence of an underlying community structure .",
    "this unsatisfactory result is also obtained when optimizing the @xmath22 merit factor , but in this case the optimal partition is into @xmath96 communities , two of them with @xmath108 nodes each , and the third one with @xmath109 nodes        on the other hand , when we run the optimization algorithm with the strong community condition , no partition is obtained .",
    "this is true for all ring networks because an hypothetical frontier node , with @xmath110 , will not satisfy the strong community condition .",
    "another social network which has attracted considerable interest is the one corresponding to the bottlenose dolphins network , which has been fully analyzed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this small social network is composed by 62 nodes and it is known to consist of two communities of sizes 41 and 21 nodes each . following the approach proposed in this work we first analyzes this network applying the q@xmath111 analysis in our simulated annealing approach .",
    "the result of this analysis is the partition of the network into four communities composed by @xmath98 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath76 nodes each . when we performed the optimization of the weak community definition we obtained five communities of @xmath105 , @xmath76 , @xmath91 , @xmath82 and @xmath114 nodes each .",
    "finally when the dolphin network is analyzed in terms of the strong community definition we obtained the actual partition , as observed experimentally , in two communities of @xmath115 and @xmath98 nodes each .",
    "these last two results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in this figure",
    "we show the two communities according to the strong community definition as circles ( @xmath115 nodes community ) and as squares ( @xmath98 nodes community ) .",
    "the corresponding analysis according to the weak community definition further divides the previous two communities and are denoted by the different shades of gray ( see caption for details ) in the figure .",
    "it should be noted at this point that when the optimization of @xmath61 is performed with the extra constraint that the number of communes is @xmath95 we obtain the same community structure as observed experimentally .",
    "merely subdivides the communities obtained through @xmath71 optimization . ]",
    "we conclude our short list of examples with the analysis of computer generated graphs which have a community structure .",
    "a word of caution should be raised at this point , because the communities built into these graphs are usually of uncertain nature and being purely theoretical , the assumed community structure can not be verified experimentallyas in the case of the zachary karate club or the bottlenose dolphins case .      in this case",
    "we use the method proposed and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we take a @xmath116 nodes graph @xmath0 divided in four modules @xmath117 of @xmath118 nodes each and with nodes degree @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "we have earlier defined @xmath28 ( @xmath51 ) as the number of links that connect node @xmath49 to another node in ( out of ) @xmath121 .",
    "when @xmath51 is varied between @xmath122 to @xmath112 , @xmath0 go from a strong communality graph to a quasi - random one .    in the framework of weak and strong merit factors optimization",
    "the expected four communities partition was obtained for @xmath123 , where @xmath124 only for @xmath125 . when @xmath126 the mean number of external links is bigger or equal to internal ones in each module and no partition was obtained .",
    "we now use the formalism introduced in @xcite , in which an algorithm for generating a class of benchmark graphs , that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes was devised .",
    "the aim of this algorithm is to built a graph with more or less well defined community structure ( in the caption of figure @xmath78 in this paper a reference is made to communities in the strong sensewhich is not the case for this algorithm as is easily verified ) .",
    "it is assumed that both the degree and the community size distributions are power laws , with exponents @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "the number of nodes is @xmath14 , the average degree is @xmath129 .",
    "one more parameter characterizing this model is the mixing parameter @xmath130 .",
    "each node shares a fraction @xmath131 of its links with the other nodes of its community and a fraction @xmath132 with the other nodes of the network .",
    "we have generated graphs according to this algorithm and we have analyzed them using the girvan - newman definition of community using our global optimization approach @xcite and the one proposed in this work .",
    "the parameters defining the graphs were chosen to be : @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 .",
    "the size of the graphs was fixed in @xmath136 nodes , and the mean degree in @xmath137 ( maximum degree=@xmath138 ) .",
    "the results of such a calculation are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( see captions for details ) .",
    "the quality of the partitions obtained with the recognition algorithms with respect to the communities established by the algorithm of lancichinetti et al . is measured by means of the so called _ normalized mutual information _ @xcite . according to the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , our merit factors definitions outperforms the girvan - newman approach .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite s. fortunato and m. barthlemy showed that modularity @xmath22 optimization fails to detect communities smaller than a certain threshold which depends on global parameters of the network under study , as is the case of the total number of links in the network .",
    "following @xcite we can define a community from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , in the framework of modularity @xmath139 , as a subgraph @xmath140 that satisfy :    @xmath141    this expression can be interpreted as the community strength in this framework .",
    "we can write @xmath142 , where @xmath37 and @xmath143 denote the number of internal and external links for subgraph @xmath144 , and write @xmath145 as a fraction of internal links @xmath146 with @xmath147 . then , from eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , the following condition for the community size @xmath37 is obtained : @xmath148the dependency on total number of links @xmath11 in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] clearly shows that the community definition , in the context of modularity @xmath22 , is non - local . in @xcite",
    "the authors show that this non - locality is the origin of _ limit resolution problem_.     nodes . ]    on the other hand , in our approach the community definition is strictly local .",
    "then , we can decide if a subgraph is a community without regards to the size of the entire network . to illustrate this conclusion we work out an example introduced in @xcite .",
    "let us suppose a ring of totally connected subgraphs ( from now on _ cliques _ ) in fig .",
    "each subgraph has @xmath149 nodes connected by @xmath150 internal links and two external ones , and we have @xmath151 of this subgraphs with a total number of links @xmath152 .",
    "the optimal partition for strong and weak community definition frameworks is the natural one : each clique constitutes a single community .",
    "this can be easily shown by analyzing another alternative partition in which each community @xmath45 contains @xmath153 cliques .",
    "first , we calculate the strength @xmath59 for one of this subgraphs containing @xmath154 cliques : @xmath155now , we want to compare the result of eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] with the total strength of the same subgraph @xmath45 when each clique is taken as a single community . in this case ,",
    "the strength of @xmath45 is given by @xmath154 times the strength of one clique : @xmath156    then , it is straightforward to see that @xmath157 is equivalent to : @xmath158 - 2(nw-2)>0   \\label{eq9}\\ ] ]    we have said that each clique constitutes a single community in the strong ( and then , also in the weak ) community definition , therefore @xmath159 .",
    "then , the condition of eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] is satisfied for all @xmath153 .",
    "this is to say that the optimal partition in our approach is that one for which each clique constitutes a single community .",
    "this is not the general case in the modularity @xmath22 framework .",
    "it was showed in @xcite that , due to resolution limit problem , partitions in communities with two or more cliques can give larger values of @xmath22 than with single clique communities .",
    "in this work we have proposed new merit factors to recognize communities in networks .",
    "these merit factors are more realistic than the ones currently in use in the literature because they strictly adhere to what a community is expected to be , i.e. , a subset of nodes which are more connected among themselves than to the rest of the network under consideration .",
    "we started by putting forward this qualitative definition of a community and then we reviewed the meaning of the quite popular measure of the quality of a given partition known as the modularity @xmath22 . as we have discussed above ,",
    "the community definition associated to this quantity is non - local and does not necessarily corresponds to the aforementioned qualitative definition .",
    "one of the consequences of the non - local character intrinsic to this quantity is the limit resolution problem as stated in @xcite .    in order to recognize communities in networks that strictly adhere to the qualitative definition ,",
    "we have used ( following @xcite ) two local community definitions : the weak one and the strong one . in order to use this definitions to recognize communities",
    "we have developed a criteria to quantify the strength of a community ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "afterwards , we have defined two merit factors associated with @xmath24 which we named @xmath71 and @xmath61 . as with @xmath22 the problem of recognizing communities in a network",
    "is mapped onto an optimization problem , i.e. , the communities in a network are the elements of the partition which maximizes @xmath71 or @xmath61 . we have performed the optimization of these merit factors on some standard networks by implementing an algorithm in the spirit of simulated annealing . the limit resolution intrinsic to the @xmath22 definition is not present in our approach .",
    "it is worth noticing at this point that the solution to the detection of communities in the strong sense is also a solution in the weak sense but not necessarily optimal . on the other hand ,",
    "the converse is generally not true as we stated in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the strong community definition tends to give larger communities because of its inability to deal with nodes that are equally shared by two highly connected subgraphs , but on the other hand has the nice property that it is the only one that gives no partition for symmetric string networks and also solves the problem of the bottle nose dolphins network exactly , without constraints in the number of communities ."
