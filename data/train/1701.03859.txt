    "quantum operations relative to coherence have become important approaches and resources , such as incoherent operations .",
    "recently , coherence breaking channels for the finite dimensional case , as a subclass of inherent operations , are defined and characterized in @xcite . as we know",
    ", continuous variable ( cv ) quantum systems are fundamental important from theoretical and experimental views .",
    "in particular , gaussian states can be produced and managed experimentally easy .",
    "several researchers focused on the theory of ( quantifying ) quantum coherence of gaussian states ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , gaussian maximally incoherent channels also be characterized in @xcite . in the paper , we characterize gaussian coherence - breaking channels and focus on some relative problems .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a complete characterization of gaussian coherence - breaking channels .",
    "furthermore , we show the inclusion relation among gpptcs , gcbcs , gebcs , gcqcs and gqccs . in section 3 , we discuss the property of the tensor product of a gcbc and arbitrary a gaussian channel with entanglement inputs , and show an observation that the tensor product of gcbc and arbitrary a gaussian channel maps all input states into product states , and its connection to channel capacity .",
    "we first give some necessary notations on gcbcs .",

    "let us recall the boolean matrix is the matrix with all elements in @xmath28 and the column stochastic matrix is the matrix satisfying the sum of elements in each a column is 1 .    *",
    "theorem 2.1 * _ for an @xmath0-mode gaussian channel @xmath29 , @xmath18 is coherence - breaking if and only if @xmath30 , @xmath31 and there exist scalars @xmath32 such that @xmath33 in particular , every one - mode gaussian coherence - breaking channel has the form @xmath34 . _",
    "* noting that a single - mode gaussian state is incoherent ( thermal ) iff it has the diagonal covariance matrix , zero displacement and squeezing , and the @xmath0-mode gaussian incoherent state is the tensor product of single - mode gaussian incoherent states ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "next let us begin with the proof of the claim in the part b of the fourth section in @xcite for the sake of self - containment .",

    "next we uncover the inclusion relation among kinds of gaussian channels .",

    "it follows that @xmath146 .",
