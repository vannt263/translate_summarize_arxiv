    "it is clearly seen that in weak fields the main eit peak ( central band ) is red - shifted due to the cycle - averaged ac stark effect .",
    "since the rf frequency is much smaller than the characteristic atomic frequency ( the kepler frequency @xmath36  ghz for the given state ) , the ac shift follows from the dc polarizability ( @xmath37mhz/(v / cm)@xmath38 for 57s@xmath11 ) . for amplitudes @xmath391.6",

    "for the case @xmath35  v / cm , the line profiles of all bands , including the weak @xmath51 bands , are already significantly broadened by the rf - induced mixing of the 57s@xmath11 state with the manifold of hydrogen - like states for @xmath52 ( states with quantum defects @xmath53 ) .",
    "this is expected from a dc stark shift calculation shown in fig .",
    "3  ( c ) , from which it is evident that the 57s@xmath11 level first intersects with hydrogen - like states at fields as low as @xmath54  v / cm and begins to substantially mix with such states between 1 and 2  v / cm .",
    "we have performed a series of measurements such as in fig .  2 , in which we have increased the amplitude of the sinusoidal rf modulation field from 0 to 3.7  v / cm in steps of 0.1  v / cm . in fig .",
    "3  ( a ) , the spectrum is seen to progress through several regimes that show how the oscillator strength of the @xmath55 @xmath4 @xmath56 rydberg transition becomes spread over the rf modulation sidebands of the 57s@xmath11 level as well as other rydberg states and their rf sidebands the 57s@xmath11 level couples with . in the weak - field regime ( @xmath57  v / cm ) , the @xmath45 band is the only one clearly visible , and it exhibits the aforementioned cycle - averaged quadratic ac stark shift . in an intermediate regime ( @xmath58v/@xmath59  v / cm ) the even modulation orders @xmath60 and @xmath61 rise in strength , while the @xmath45 order decreases in strength and drops out at about @xmath62  v / cm ( label 1 in fig .",

    "reflects the fact that at @xmath66  v / cm the 57s@xmath11 level is already deeply within the manifold of hydrogen - like states [ see fig .  3  ( c ) ] , and the weak - field model does not apply any more . inspecting figs .  3  ( b ) and  ( c )",
    ", it is seen that the rf - induced coupling with hydrogenic states pushes the @xmath45 band of the 57s - level to an energy below the corresponding 57s - line in the dc field .",
    "this effect amounts to an increase of the polarizability @xmath67 , which explains why the @xmath45 dropout occurs at a field below the value obtained from the weak - field estimate .    in the strong - field regime ( @xmath68",
    "v / cm ) , the shifts of the rf - induced sidebands as a function of field turn from quadratic into linear ( label 3 in fig .",
    "3 ) , indicating the strong rf - induced mixing of the 57s@xmath11 level with rf - induced superpositions of hydrogenic states that exhibit linear stark shifts .",
    "the undulations of the spectrum , observed below the labels 2 in fig .  3 ,",
    "are a manifestation of the complex rf - induced coupling behavior of the 57s@xmath11 level with the large number of such hydrogenic states .",
    "the absence of odd rf modulation sidebands in fig .  3 indicates the absence of dc bias fields . in principle ,",
    "dc fields could originate from stray charges on the cell walls or from external electric fields penetrating from outside the cell into the probe region .",
    "however , dc fields appear to be shielded ( see  @xcite and fig .  5 below ) .",
    "for a quantitative interpretation of our measured spectra , we use a non - perturbative floquet method the accuracy of which is only limited by the size of the atomic basis set used .",

    "the fourier coefficients @xmath81 are obtained from the time - dependent floquet wave - packets , @xmath82 , and exact time - periodic functions , @xmath83 , according to @xmath84 for more details , see  @xcite .",
    "the basis @xmath85 must be chosen large enough to cover important couplings .",
    "since the theory has to accurately describe mixing with hydrogenic states , it is obvious that the basis has to include all @xmath86 and @xmath87-values , which are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively ( for @xmath90 only @xmath91 ) .",
    "since the fields are @xmath92-polarized , @xmath93 .",

    "the time evolution operator @xmath78 is integrated in time steps @xmath95 through one rf cycle",
    ". the value of @xmath95 must be small enough that @xmath96 for all energy differences @xmath97 for basis states @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the present case , @xmath100 to @xmath101",
    "is appropriate .",
    "the agreement between experimental and calculated excitation rates , seen in fig .",
    "3 , is generally very good , both in terms of the positions of spectral features as well as relative signal strengths .",
    "the beading within the steep bands in the experimental data reflects the step size in the electric - field change between the scans . comparing figs .  3  ( a ) and  ( b ) we note agreement even in fine details , such as the significant kink of the @xmath102 band at 2.3  v / cm ( just below label 2 ) and the groups of levels that form bridges between the @xmath45 and @xmath103 bands at 3.0  v / cm ( to the lower - right of label 1 ) . in the high - field regime ,",
    "most of the spectral features are not due to single , isolated levels ( floquet states and rf sidebands ) , but due to signals associated with several levels merging into compound structures . comparing calculated with experimental spectroscopic floquet maps",
    ", we estimate the deviation between the experimental and theoretical electric - field axes to be below @xmath104v / cm .",
    "the uncertainty may be due to field inhomogeneities in the cs vapor cell or a calibration uncertainty of the rf - voltage measurement of the signal applied to the field plate ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "[ t ] $ ] with @xmath105  mhz.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we also have investigated modulation with a distorted rf signal that has a small degree of anharmonicity .",
    "the result of this measurement , also performed at a modulation frequency of 70  mhz , is shown in fig .",
    "in comparison with fig .  3 , where the applied rf modulation was a pure sine wave , the spectra in fig .",
    "4 exhibit additional anharmonicity - induced odd - order modulation bands , labeled with arrows .",
    "the odd sidebands apparently result from higher - harmonic components in the distorted harmonic rf field . to verify this assumption ,",
    "we have computed numerous floquet spectra for periodic rf fields with expansion @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "we set @xmath107 to represent the main rf term and keep all other fourier coefficients small .",
    "in view of earlier work  @xcite and fig .  5 below , we expect that higher harmonics rather than the dc component of the distorted rf signal will give rise to the additional sidebands .",
    "we have therefore focused on cases with @xmath108 ( which have a zero cycle - averaged field ) . in figure 4  ( b )",
    "we show a calculated floquet spectrum for @xmath109 . both in experiment and calculation ,",
    "the anharmonicity - induced odd - order modulation sidebands begin to emerge at about 2.5  v / cm and then quickly rise in visibility . at the high - field limit in fig .  4 , odd and even sidebands have similar visibility .",
    "figure  4 and similar calculations demonstrate that rf modulation spectroscopy of rydberg atoms is quite sensitive to anharmonic content in periodic rf waveforms , and that the susceptibility of the atomic response to the anharmonicity increases with the rf field .    , added to a purely harmonic rf modulation with frequency @xmath105  mhz and fixed amplitude @xmath34  v / cm . in panel ( a )",
    "the @xmath110-axis shows the applied dc field , which is much larger than the shielded , remaining dc field within the atom - field interaction region . to enhance sensitivity for weak odd - band signals ,",
    "the probe rabi frequency has been chosen 1.5 times as large as in fig .",
    "3.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we have analyzed the effect of a dc offset field on floquet maps of the rf - modulated 57@xmath111 rydberg state .",
    "the directions of the applied dc and rf electric fields are parallel to each other , as evident from figure  1 . in the calculation shown in fig .  5  ( b ) , over the range of @xmath112 from 0 to 0.2  v",
    "/ cm we see the strength of the first - order ( @xmath113 ) sidebands rise to about 10  @xmath114 of the strength of the @xmath45 band , in qualitative agreement with the low - field model in  @xcite .",
    "the dc stark shift , @xmath115 , is very minor and near - invisible in figure  5  ( b ) .",
    "however , we do not see the first - order sidebands in the experimental floquet map shown in figure 5  ( a ) .",
    "the fact that an applied dc electric field is not effective in generating any visible atomic response can be attributed to a dc shielding effect , in which the dc electric field is screened by surface charges on the inside cell walls .",
    "the shielding effect , which has been reported before ref .",
    "@xcite , is attributed to ions and electrons produced by ionization of rydberg atoms and photo - electric effect on the cell walls . under presence of an additional rf field ( our case ) ,",
    "the shielding effect persists , showing that the high - frequency field does not impede the dc shielding . from fig .  5 we find a lower bound of the dc shielding factor of @xmath116 , limited by experimental sensitivity and the low value of the applied dc field .",
    "the actual shielding factor may be much higher .",
    "in summary , we have studied rf - modulated rydberg - eit spectra in a cascade three - level system in a cesium room - temperature vapor cell .",
    "the observed rydberg floquet spectra exhibit field - induced level shifts and sidebands in weak rf fields , whereas higher - order sidebands , complex state mixing and level crossings with hydrogenic states are found in strong rf fields .",
    "weak anharmonicity of the rf signal has been found to produce odd modulation sidebands . in work",
    "not shown we have obtained qualitatively similar results for modulation frequencies in the range from 40 to 80  mhz .",
    "the experimental results are well explained by our floquet model , even considering details of the complex high - field spectra .",
    "the rydberg - eit spectroscopy presented here could be applied in an atom - based technique for antenna - free measurement of rf electric fields .",
    "the method allows for fast , all - optical readout of the rf - modified rydberg level structure . in order to evaluate whether the rydberg - eit method allows",
    "spectral analysis of periodic rf waveforms , a detailed study using a wide range of synthesized periodic signals may be conducted .",
