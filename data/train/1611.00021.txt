    "complex array geometries and the use of novel materials such as graphene and metamaterials for which one can tune properties such as coupling , nonlinearity and gain / loss translate into controlled dynamics and bifurcations of interest to logical devices ( switches , transistors , logic gates ) , next generation lasers and new formats for optical communications.@xcite    here , we follow the vein of the work of bender _ et al_.@xcite who considered whether a quantum mechanical hamiltonian system with a complex potential can have a real spectrum .",
    "it is the case that a necessary condition for the spectrum to be real is that the hamiltonian of the schrdinger has parity @xmath1 and time @xmath2 symmetry ( @xmath0 ) which is true when the potential satisfies the condition @xmath3.@xcite this has led to the identification of a broad range of special classes of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians which possess a real eigenspectrum and @xmath0-symmetric eigenstates . perhaps more relevant",
    "is that if the strength of the odd imaginary part of the potential is parametrized , one typically finds that at a certain parameter value the spectrum becomes complex .",
    "whenever the eigenfrequencies remain real , we refer to this case as @xmath4 @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "if they become complex , one typically refers to this as the regime where @xmath0-symmetry has been _",
    "broken_. this work originally presented in the quantum mechanical framework can be naturally extended to the optical regime .",
    "in fact , it was in the latter setting that @xmath0-symmetric systems were first experimentally realized in the form of dimers,@xcite ( i.e. , optical waveguide couplers ) and more recently in the realm of full one - dimensional arrays.@xcite novel photonic structures can be conceived with @xmath0-symmetry properties , which translate to having a real index of refraction profile that is even in space , whereas the gain / loss imaginary part is odd . manipulating light propagation under @xmath0-symmetric structures and what broken symmetry entails",
    "has been the focus of intense research activity in recent time.@xcite    in this paper we present results on nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric discrete arrays focusing especially on the case of a few lattice nodes . in such photonic systems",
    "there are four principal parameters that characterize the type of nonlinear modes , their propagation features and possible bifurcations : nearest neighbor coupling , individual propagation constants , nonlinear coefficient and @xmath0gain - loss coefficients .",
    "altogether , dynamics in nonlinear photonic arrays is currently a rich field of active research .",
    "here we present results for three configurations : a dimer , a trimer and a most recently considered setting of twisted multicore fibers.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ptcoupler ] , we introduce the coupled @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) array with two and three sites .",
