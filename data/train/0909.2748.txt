    "in a quantum network based on photons  @xcite , the nodes can be regarded as information processing stations ( e.g. , quantum computers ) , while the links between any two nodes are provided by the information carriers ( e.g. , photons ) . due to the high - speed transmission and low dissipation in optical fibers ,",
    "photons are considered to be excellent information carriers ( both for classical and quantum transmissions ) .    in recent years , with the development of nano - optics , numerous photonic information processing proposals have been implemented by using on - chip solid state devices , such as semiconducting microcavities ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and superconducting transmission line resonators ( e.g. , refs .",
    "therefore , how to realize on - chip single - photon devices ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) becomes now an increasingly important research area .",
    "for example , single - photon switches ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which control single - photon transport at will ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , play an important role in this area .",
    "coupled - cavity arrays ( ccas )  @xcite are one type of photonic system , which has been proposed to process photonic quantum information . compared with the usual waveguides , which have only a linear dispersion relation , the _ nonlinear dispersion _ of ccas can result in the emergence of bound states of single photons .",
    "many proposals have been put forward to realize quantum switches in ccas , which could be used to control single - photon transport .",
    "for example , the reflection and transmission of single photons in a one - dimensional coupled resonator waveguide can be controlled by a tunable two - level system inside one of the cavities  @xcite . moreover , controllable single - photon transport in a one - dimensional cca with a tunable hopping coupling has recently been studied  @xcite .    in this paper , we study another approach to realize controllable single - photon transport in a one - dimensional cca , considering either one _ frequency - tunable cavity _ ( ftc ) or two ftcs .",
    "this work is motivated by recent mostly experimental results on frequency - tunable transmission line resonators ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where the frequencies of the resonators can be changed by varying either the boundary condition of the electromagnetic wave or the magnetic flux through the squids used to construct the transmission line resonators .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , here the photon transport is controlled by _ tuning the frequency of the cavity _ , and there is _ no _ additional two - level system , placed inside one of the cavities , to control photon transport .",
    "therefore , this proposal seems to be simpler and easier to implement experimentally than those in refs .",
    "@xcite . by changing the frequency of either one ftc or two ftcs , the reflection and transmission of a single photon in the coupled - cavity array can be controlled .",
    "we also study the photon bound states and photon resonant states  @xcite in this coupled - cavity array .    for the coupled - cavity array with _",
    "one _ frequency - tunable cavity , if the frequency of the frequency - tunable cavity is larger than that of other cavities , there is a _ bound _ state above the energy band of the corresponding bosonic tight - binding model  @xcite ; while the bound state is below the energy band when the frequency of the frequency - tunable cavity is smaller than that of other cavities .    for the cca with _ two _ ftcs",
    ", we find that there exist _ bound _ states around the ftcs .",
    "moreover , when the frequencies of the two ftcs are much larger than those of other cavities and the hopping couplings between any two nearest - neighbor cavities are weak , for resonant wave vectors , a single photon can be in resonance with the cca and then remain trapped in the cavities between the two ftcs . a single photon in _ resonance _ with the cca behaves as a photon inside a supercavity  @xcite .",

    ".    typically , there are two physical mechanisms to tune the resonant frequency of a superconducting transmission line resonator .",
    "one method is to change the boundary condition of the electromagnetic wave in a transmission line . by changing the boundary condition ,",
    "the effective wavelengths ( also effective frequencies ) of the resonant modes are changed  @xcite .",
    "another method is to construct a transmission line resonator by using a series of magnetic - flux - biased squids .",
    "since the effective inductor of a magnetic - flux - biased squid can be tuned by changing the biased magnetic flux  @xcite , the inductance per unit length of the squid array is controllable .",
    "therefore , the resonant frequencies of the modes in the squid array can be tuned by controlling the biased magnetic flux threading through the squids .",
    "below , we present a brief review of these two methods already used to obtain frequency - tunable transmission line resonator .",
    "the original derivations of the two methods have been given in refs .",
    "@xcite , but for the sake of completeness of this paper , here we briefly review the main aspects of these .",
    "we briefly summarize the mechanism for frequency tunability of a superconducting transmission line resonator by controlling its boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "the lumped element circuit of a superconducting transmission line resonator with a symmetric squid , which is equivalent to a chain of identical @xmath188 circuits , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fretunabletlr.eps ] .        here , @xmath189 is the phase variable of the @xmath14th node ; @xmath190 and @xmath191 are respectively the capacitance and inductance of each @xmath188 circuit ; @xmath192 and @xmath193 are the phase variables across the left and right josephson junctions in the squid , respectively ; @xmath194 is the capacitance of one junction in the squid .",
    "the squid is equivalent to a junction with an effective josephson energy @xmath195 . here",
    "@xmath196 is the josephson energy of one junction , @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the flux through the loop of the squid and @xmath199 is the magnetic flux quanta .",
    "@xmath200 is the net phase across the squid .",
    "note that here the self - inductance of the superconducting loop is neglected .",
    "when @xmath201 , and the charging energy and josephson energy satisfy the condition @xmath202^{2}$ ] , then the squid can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "for the phase variable of the transmission line resonator , the wave equation reads  @xcite @xmath203 where @xmath204 . here @xmath205 and @xmath206 are , respectively , the capacitance and inductance per unit length of the transmission line resonator ; and @xmath207 refers to the second - order spatial derivative .",
    "note that here we have used the continuous variable @xmath152 instead of the discrete variable @xmath14 .    in terms of the relation between the electric current and the phase @xmath208 ,",
    "the boundary condition for this system is  @xcite @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the length of the transmission line resonator .",
    "the wave equation  ( [ waveequationoftlr ] ) with the boundary condition  ( [ boundarycondition ] ) can be solved by assuming the solution @xmath211 \\cos \\left ( kx\\right)$ ]",
    ". the euler - lagrange equation for the phase variable @xmath212 leads to the following dispersion equation  @xcite @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath216 of the resonant modes in the transmission line resonator are the solutions of the dispersion equation  ( [ dispersionequation ] ) .",
    "since the effective josephson energy @xmath217 of the squid is tunable through the bias magnetic flux @xmath198 , the wave vectors @xmath216 can be tuned continuously by controlling @xmath198 .",
    "this approach  @xcite to tune cavities could be used to tune the frequency of either one cavity or two cavities in our proposal .          following ref .",
    "@xcite , figure  [ fretunabletlr2.eps](a ) shows a device where the center of the resonator is composed of a series array of squids . a symmetric squid ( in fig .  [ fretunabletlr2.eps](b ) )",
    "is equivalent to an effective tunable inductance ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fretunabletlr2.eps](c ) ) . from kirchhoff s current law and the josephson current - phase relation  @xcite ,",
    "then @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the critical current of a single josephson junction , @xmath189 @xmath220 are the phases across the two josephson junctions . introducing new phase variables @xmath221 and @xmath222 , then @xmath223 , where @xmath224 .",

    "an effective inductance @xmath226 can be defined  @xcite by the phase @xmath227 and current @xmath228 , @xmath229 which can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath230 obviously , the effective inductance of the symmetric squid can be controlled through two externally controllable parameters : the biasing current @xmath228 and the external biasing flux @xmath231 .",
    "thus the resonant frequency of the modes in a squid array becomes tunable because the inductance per unit length of the center conductor of the transmission line resonator is controllable .",
    "this approach  @xcite could also be used to tune the frequency of either one cavity or two cavities in our proposed system .",
    "this would allow the exploration of the effect predicted here .",
    "let us now provide some remarks on the experimental implementation of our proposal . in our model ,",
    "the key elements are the frequency - tunable cavities , which have recently been realized experimentally .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resonant frequency @xmath3 of a transmission line resonator was tuned from @xmath232 ghz to @xmath233 ghz ( i.e. , @xmath234 ghz , then @xmath235 , if we choose @xmath236 ghz , then @xmath237 .",
    "similarly for @xmath110 . in principle , the hopping coupling @xmath8 between two nearest - neighbor transmission line resonators can be tuned  @xcite . in recent experiments ( e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the magnitude of the hopping interaction is @xmath238 mhz @xmath239 .",
    "this hopping coupling @xmath8 can be increased by using larger capacitors to connect two transmission line resonators .",
    "therefore , this study seems to be within the reach of current ( or near future ) experiments .    compared to the method using a two - level atom as a controller , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the present proposal avoids photon dissipation due to the spontaneous emission of the atom .",
    "it should be pointed out that we have neglected the change of the hopping coupling @xmath8 between the frequency - tunable cavity and its nearest - neighbor cavities when the frequency of the ftc is tuned . in practice , this dependence exists .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied controllable single - photon transport and single - photon states in a one - dimensional coupled - cavity array ( cca ) with one or two frequency - tunable cavities ( ftcs ) .",
    "we found that , by adjusting the frequency of the frequency - tunable cavities , the coherent transport of a single photon in the cca can be realized .",
    "we have also shown that there exist bound states in the cca .    for a cca with _",
    "one _ ftc , when the frequency of the ftc is larger than those of other cavities , there exists a _ bound _ state above the energy band of the cca .",
    "when the frequency of the ftc is smaller than those of other cavities , there exists a bound state below the energy band . in these two cases , the bound states have even parity .",
    "once the frequency of the ftc is given , the cca has only one bound state .",
    "this result is different from that of a cca coupled with a two - level atom  @xcite , in which there exists two bound states at the same time , one above the energy band and the other below the energy band .    for a cca with _ two _",
    "ftcs , in the two cases that the frequencies of the two ftcs are larger or lower than those of other cavities , there exist two _ bound _ states , one of odd parity and the other one of even parity .",
    "when the frequency detuning @xmath240 of the two ftcs is very larger than the hopping coupling @xmath8 between two nearest - neighbor cavities , there exist two kinds of _ resonant _ modes , one of odd parity , and another one of even parity .",
