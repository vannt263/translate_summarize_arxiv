    "we next consider a system where the two layers are separated sufficiently so that there are no interlayer exchange interaction ( @xmath329 ) nor the tunneling interaction ( @xmath333 ) .",
    "then , the total hamiltonian is invariant under two local transformations , u@xmath334(1 ) and u@xmath335(1 ) , which act on electrons on the two layers independently , @xmath336corresponding to these two u(1 ) symmetries , we should introduced two normalized cb fields by@xmath337where @xmath203 and @xmath338we have a set of two cp@xmath339 fields as the basic fields , each of which is the dynamic field for each layer at @xmath17 .",
    "topological solitons are simple skyrmions .",
    "it is interesting to consider a case without the interlayer exchange interaction ( @xmath340 ) but with a nonnegligible tunneling interaction ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "the basic field is the cp@xmath2 field because the hamiltonian possesses only the local u(1 ) symmetry ( b2localu1 ) .",

    "we start with the su(4)-invariant limit of the exchange interaction ( @xmath349 ) , where a biskymion must be excited .",
    "we question what would happen as @xmath319 is decreased .",
    "as far as @xmath124 is significant , two electrons in one landau site are indistinguishable , and hence we need the grassmannian field @xmath34 to describe the system . furthermore , the spin biskyrmion ( [ spinskyrm ] ) is insensible to the interlayer stiffness @xmath319 , as we have remarked , because it is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ contispin ] ) .",
    "hence , nothing would happen for the spin biskyrmion as @xmath239 .",
    "it is to be stressed that the existence of topological solitons is the property of the grassmannian manifold and not the property of the hamiltonian ( [ exchagrass ] ) .",

    "thus , @xmath319 is quite small compared with @xmath354 .",

    "( the monolayer state is constructed by emptying the back layer by tuning the bias voltage in the bilayer sample .",
    "the total electron density in the bilayer system is controlled so that it is precisely twice of that in the monolayer system . )",
    "they have found 7 flipped spins in the 1k - sample while 14 flipped spins in the 11k - sample when the tilting angle is small [ fig.[experkumad ] ] .",
    "when the tilting angle becomes large , the number of flipped spins makes a transition from 14 to 7 in the 11k - sample .",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "as the sample is tilted , the tunneling gap is known@xcite to decrease as@xmath355 in fig.[experkumad ] the transition occurs at @xmath356 , where @xmath357k .",
    "it is small enough compared with other interactions and would be practically negligible .",
    "they have also confirmed 7 flipped spins in the monolayer limit of both samples .",
    "( only one spin is flipped in all cases for a sufficiently large tilting angle , where a vortex is excited in one of the layers since the tunneling gap becomes so small and the zeeman effect becomes so large . ) these facts are consistent with our conclusion that biskyrmions ( simple skyrmion ) are excited in a sample with a large ( negligible ) tunneling gap .",
    "we have investigated the blqh systems at @xmath17 .",
    "there are three phases , i.e. the spin phase , the ppin phase and the canted phase . experimentally the spin and ppin phases are clearly observed .",
    "we have presented a field - theoretical formulation of these two phases , and analyzed soft waves and topological excitations .",
    "we have shown that the dynamic field is the grassmannian g@xmath1 field , which is a set of two cp@xmath2 fields but contains only four complex independent fields .",
    "accordingly there are four independent soft waves ( pseudo - goldstone modes ) as neutral low energy excitations .",
    "we have also shown that there are topological excitations as charged excitations : they are biskyrmions comprised of two simple skyrmions in the two layers and possess the electric charge @xmath3 .",
    "this conclusion on charged excitations is confirmed by a recent experimental resultkumada00l in the spin phase at @xmath17 , where the number of flipped spins is found to be twice as large as that at @xmath16 for a sample with large @xmath358 .",
