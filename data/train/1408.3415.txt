    ", there is measurement - based qc @xcite , adiabatic qc @xcite , holonomic qc @xcite , and topological qc @xcite , as well as variations that combine aspects from different models .",
    "one such hybrid scheme  the adiabatic quantum transistor ( aqt ) model proposed by bacon , flammia and crosswhite  @xcite  is appealing from a practical perspective , as it demands very minimal control requirements .",
    "this model is technically open loop holonomic qc but draws upon aspects of all the aforementioned architectures , and requires only the ability to prepare the ground state of an interacting many - body hamiltonian and perform an adiabatic application of a global control field , without the need for any local control .",
    "the aqt model builds upon earlier work on one - dimensional quantum computational wires and their usefulness for measurement - based and holonomic quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "these models are best understood in terms of computation on information encoded in the correlations amongst qubits in the ground state  @xcite , which can also be viewed from a very recent perspective as fractionalized edge modes associated with the boundaries of symmetry - protected phases of spin chains  @xcite . in the measurement - based model ,",
    "a very precise relationship between the computational properties of a spin chain and its symmetry - protected quantum order was developed by else _",
    "et al . _",
    "such a precise relationship is lacking in the open loop holonomic qc setting , and so the general physical principles that define the aqt models and give rise to their special properties are not yet explored .    in this paper , we show that the operation of an adiabatic quantum transistor can be viewed as driving the system through a symmetric phase transition , from a symmetry - protected ( sp ) phase to a trivial symmetric phase , using a global control field . within this perspective , we extend the specific aqt gates defined using finely tuned model hamiltonians in ref .",

    "such adiabatic quantum transistors that are based solely on the properties of symmetry - protected phases can be called _ symmetry - protected adiabatic quantum transistors _ ( spaqt ) .    this new perspective in terms of processing quantum logic at the boundary of a sp ordered phase provides several other natural generalizations of the aqt model .",
    "we explore the degenerate ground state encoding used in the aqt model in terms of the defining properties of a sp phase , and in doing so , determine the quantum logic gates that can be implemented by a spin chain referencing only the symmetries of a sp phase .",
    "we show how multiple different logic gates can be performed by preserving distinct subgroups of a larger symmetry group during the evolution .",

    "a sp phase is defined to be a class of symmetric uniformly gapped hamiltonians @xmath0 that are equivalent under such symmetry - respecting adiabatic evolutions .",
    "we will consider only on - site symmetries , i.e. , those whose representations take the form of a tensor product of the same representation @xmath1 on each physical site , and hence the symmetry condition is @xmath2=0 , \\",

    "( we note that symmetries which are not on - site may also support sp phases , but we do not consider these here . ) we further restrict our consideration to only those symmetric hamiltonians possessing a unique symmetric ground state under periodic boundary conditions . in this",
    "setting distinct equivalence classes emerge , the class containing a symmetric product state is a trivial symmetric phase and other distinct classes are called symmetry - protected ( sp ) phases .",
    "a consequence of this definition is that no constant length , gapped , symmetric adiabatic evolution of a ground state in a non - trivial sp phase can map it to a product state .",
    "this can be interpreted as being due to a non - trivial symmetry - protected entanglement structure that persists in all ground states of a sp phase @xcite . in one dimension",
    ", we identify this entanglement by a schmidt rank greater than one across any bipartition of the system .",
    "this entanglement can be intuitively understood as arising from a pair of maximally entangled , fractionalised virtual particles localised on opposite sides of the bipartition which can not be disentangled by any symmetric adiabatic evolution .",
    "there may also be some trivial entanglement present across the bipartition that can be removed by symmetric adiabatic evolution and hence is not robust throughout the phase and consequently not symmetry - protected .",
    "only the nontrivial , symmetry - protected entanglement persists in a renormalisation fixed point state of a sp phase .",
    "a chain with open boundary conditions can be viewed as a periodic chain that has been cut open and had its boundaries separated . in this case , the virtual particles at the boundaries are not correlated , as they are separated by an arbitrary distance of gapped bulk material with exponentially decaying correlations , and because we have removed the relevant hamiltonian term that was coupling them , they become free . hence a nontrivial sp hamiltonian on an open chain will possess some ground state degeneracy that can be associated to these fractionalised edge modes .    because the hamiltonian commutes with the symmetry , its degenerate ground space is closed under the symmetry action .",
    "we can therefore restrict the representation of the symmetry group to the ground space .",
    "because the symmetry group acts locally in tensor product on the chain it can not entangle the two spatially separated edge modes and therefore acts as a tensor product on the left and right edges modes , as @xmath3 .",
    "while @xmath3 must form a unitary representation of the group , there is additional freedom in defining the individual representations @xmath4 . in particular",
    ", we can allow an equal and opposite phase in the multiplication rules of the group action on left and right modes , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a function on @xmath7 giving a @xmath8 phase subject to @xmath9 being trivial ( in the second cohomology sense explained below ) .",
    "the associativity of the multiplication enforces a constraint on the @xmath10 phases .",
    "we further take equivalence classes under multiplication of each @xmath11 by some arbitrary phase function @xmath12 on @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting equivalence classes of phase functions @xmath10 on @xmath7 form the second cohomology group of the symmetry @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these equivalence classes are in one - to - one correspondence with the different sp phases possible in one dimension @xcite , and so provide a way of labeling the different sp phases .",
    "given the cohomology label of the phase the edge modes must transform under some projective representation @xmath11 of the group with the specified cohomology .",
    "in this section , we will describe how quantum information can be encoded into the fractionalized degree of freedom associated with a single edge mode of a non - trivial sp phase of a one - dimensional spin chain .",
    "it is well known that topologically ordered phases of matter provide families of quantum codes that are insensitive to the microscopic detail of the hamiltonian .",
    "symmetry - protected phases provide degenerate ground states with similar robustness but only to errors that obey a certain symmetry condition .",
    "the defining symmetries of a sp phase also provide uniform global operations that enact logical transformations upon the ground space . remarkably both",
    "the encoding and global logical operations are robust to local perturbations of the parent hamiltonian , so long as these perturbations are symmetric .",
    "the essential property of a sp phase that enables us to encode information into the ground space is an equivalence of the global symmetry operators and a projective representation acting upon the edge mode . in many ways , these global symmetry operators are analogous to logical operators of a stabilizer code , as they commute with the constraints ( hamiltonian terms ) that define the code and have a nontrivial action upon the encoded information . in the particular example of the cluster state model used to define the aqt of bacon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which has a stabilizer parent hamiltonian , these symmetry operators are logical operators . in the general case , the terms in the hamiltonian",
    "whose ground space is the ` code space ' do not necessarily commute with one another .",
    "the physical systems we consider for the remainder of the paper are chains of spin degrees of freedom , with interactions governed by a spatially local hamiltonian @xmath15 where the @xmath16 terms act on a constant number of spins around site @xmath17 and the energy scale is normalized such that @xmath18 .",
    "we only consider models where the energy gap @xmath19 between the smallest set of quasi - degenerate eigenvalues ( meaning their energy spacing shrinks exponentially as the size of the chain grows ) and the next lowest eigenvalue ( the first excitation ) is uniformly lower bounded by a constant as @xmath20 increases .",
    "we restrict our attention to models where the hamiltonian s terms all commute with a representation of some symmetry group @xmath13 .",

    "a fractional particle , denoted on the right by a small ( grey ) sphere , transforms as @xmath24 .",
    "the left edge carries a fractionalized edge degree of freedom ( orange ) , transforming as @xmath25 . ]",
    "a one - dimensional spin chain with fixed boundary conditions from a non - trivial sp phase provides two fractionalized edge modes ",
    "one at each boundary  that can be used to encode quantum information .",
    "these edge modes can be qubits or qudits ( higher - dimensional generalisations of qubits ) , depending on the dimension of the representation @xmath11 . as the two boundary modes must remain well - separated , for the purposes of quantum computation",
    "it is useful to restrict to only one of them ; we choose the left edge mode .",
    "if the chain is sufficiently long , the right mode may be ignored . for convenience of description , however , we shall consider finite chains and provide a conceptually simple way to terminate the right boundary such that it can be subsequently ignored from the description .    to isolate the left edge mode for our encoding , we terminate the right edge by a symmetric coupling @xmath26 to an additional new particle .",
    "this coupling will remove the right edge from the description , allowing us to focus purely on the left edge mode .",
    "the new particle is required to transform under a projective representation of the symmetry @xmath27 from the same cohomology class as the left edge mode ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : edge ] .",
    "this coupling will be spatially local but may have to act on a number of sites up to the injectivity radius @xcite of a matrix product state representation of the ground state such that it is possible to achieve the desired coupling on the edge mode by acting only on the physical level .",
    "the key importance of this boundary fixing is that the global symmetry action changes as @xmath28 hence the symmetry now acts on the entire chain by a projective representation with the same cohomology class as the remaining left edge mode . by making the global symmetry projective",
    ", it allows us to directly identify the restriction of the global symmetry action on the ground space with a _ single _",
    "irreducible projective representation @xmath11 .",
    "isolating one edge also has the effect of forcing the ground space degeneracy to be exact as the ground space now forms an irreducible projective representation of the symmetry group .",
    "in contrast , when there are two edge modes there may be an energy splitting that shrinks exponentially with the system size due to a weak coupling between the edges that allows the two irreducible projective representations to couple into a direct sum of unitary representations with slightly different energies .",
    "along with convenience of description , avoiding this coupling has the added advantage that it prevents phase errors accumulating due to the energy splitting of the quasi - degenerate levels of the ground space .      a defining feature of 1d sp phases @xcite is the identification of the global symmetry s action within the ground space and the action of a projective symmetry on an emergent edge mode , as @xmath29 this identification persists throughout the whole sp phase and we find it natural to think of these projective symmetries as ` logical ' operators acting on the information encoded within the ground space .",
    "any deformation of the hamiltonian that maintains the symmetry and a uniform lower bound on the spectral gap gives rise to an adiabatic evolution that must remain in the same sp phase .",
    "hence , the identification given in eq .   remains valid throughout such an evolution , and because of this , we can talk about the same projective symmetry action @xmath11 on the edge mode throughout the evolution .",
    "as we maintain the symmetry at every point of the adiabatic deformation , the resulting evolution within the ground space must commute with this symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "if the edge symmetry @xmath11 is irreducible , then by schur s lemma any adiabatic deformation within the sp phase must necessarily act as the identity operation on the encoded information ( up to a global phase ) and hence we say that the information encoded into the ground space is protected by the symmetry of the sp phase .",
    "( we do not consider the case where @xmath11 is reducible , although we note that the methods developed in the context of decoherence free subsystems @xcite can be used to generalise our results to the reducible case . )    in summary , in this section we have considered adiabatic deformations that strictly preserve the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , if an evolution changes the way the symmetry acts , then the arguments given above do not necessarily hold .",
    "it is precisely this fact that allows us to perform nontrivial unitary gates upon encoded states using adiabatic evolutions , which will be described in the coming sections .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate how an adiabatic evolution involving terms at the boundary between a non - trivial sp phase and a trivial one can result in the implementation of a protected quantum logic gate acting on the fractionalised edge mode .",
    "this gate provides a generalisation of the holonomic gates described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first illustrate the functioning of this gate using a model hamiltonian that is representative of the sp phase , and subsequently show that the gate properties are generic throughout the phase and independent of the microscopic details of the hamiltonian . for simplicity , we will only consider models of sp spin chains with nearest neighbor interactions .",

    "we now explore ways to supplement this elementary gate set with additional operations to make it universal .    to implement additional logic gates in the standard mbqc model , and similarly in the aqt model , measurements or fields that do not respect the symmetry of the phase are employed .",
    "one would not expect these unprotected operations to function uniformly well throughout a phase , but instead would depend on the microscopic details of the hamiltonian .",
    "for this reason , we do not explore this direction further .",
    "we point the interested reader to two recent proposals that employ additional ingredients to endow such gates with protection , by imposing additional symmetries ( that are not both unitary and on - site )  @xcite or via the inclusion of an additional decoupling procedure between gates  @xcite .",
    "an alternate approach to achieve more general logic gates is to employ several different types of sp matter , each with an inherent symmetry protecting a distinct gate that together make up a universal set .",

    "we exploit the fact that both @xmath130 @xmath129-rotation symmetry about two orthogonal spatial axes and full @xmath153 rotation symmetry protect the same edge modes on a chain of spin-1 particles . by choosing three distinct sp phases ,",

    "this perspective naturally leads us to the quantum transistors discussed in the next section .    to achieve a universal gate set for many qubits , we complement the single qubit gates with a nontrivial entangling gate ( equivalent to a controlled - phase gate up to local pauli operations ) on two qubits achieved within a sp phase of two coupled spin-1 chains .",
    "this sp phase is shown to be protected by a semi - direct product symmetry @xmath156 embedded within the rotation group of two decoupled chains , which protects the same edge modes as the full @xmath157 symmetry in this case .",

    "@xcite also falls into our framework ( see @xcite for a description of the analogous mbqc description of the cluster state ) , while the twisted cluster gates of ref .",
    "@xcite do not as they employ fields that do not respect the @xmath161 symmetry .",
    "hence we expect such gates to function well only near exact fixed points of a sp phase such as the aklt point or cluster state .",
    "furthermore , their method for implementing two qubit gates does not possess an irreducible edge mode .",
    "this raises the possibility of finding two qubit couplings that do not support irreducible edge modes but are still capable of generating unique logical evolutions outside the natural gate set of the specific sp model .",
    "however , there may not be the same robustness of the edge mode encoding if the coupling hamiltonian in such a process is varied , since the edge modes are no longer irreducible and hence not protected throughout the phase .",
    "in the previous sections , we showed that quantum logic gates acting on the information encoded in the fractionalised edge modes defined at the boundary of a nontrivial sp phase can be performed using local adiabatic evolutions . in this section , we will generalise the notion of an adiabatic quantum transistor , defined by bacon , crosswhite and flammia  @xcite , to show that our logic gates can also be performed by applying a global field across the whole chain simultaneously in the adiabatic limit .    for a spin chain of length @xmath20 , let @xmath162 be a hamiltonian in a non - trivial sp phase whose",

    "[ sec : elementarygate ] , although our results are not restricted to hamiltonians of this form and apply throughout the respective sp and trivial phases of any two such hamiltonians .",
    "we consider an adiabatic evolution initiated entirely within the sp phase and to which a global field is then applied , given by @xmath165 where again @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "to ensure adiabaticity , we again require @xmath58 , with @xmath19 the minimum spectral gap of @xmath59 . with this time - dependent hamiltonian ,",
    "it is clear that we are driving the system through a symmetric phase transition from a sp phase to a trivial symmetric phase .",
    "furthermore , the unitary evolution on the ground space will be the same @xmath88 no matter what point of the sp phase we start in , and hence the evolution is truly a property of the whole phase .    ,",

    "the notation used is the same as that in fig .",
    "[ fig : edge ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chainholonomy ] .",
    "the orange shading indicates the support of the quantum information that is initially localised in the left edge mode , which then becomes delocalised across the whole chain and ends up in the physical particle at the right edge . ]",
    "we note that the assumption of adiabaticity is significant , given that , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath168 ) , this evolution will pass through a phase transition .",
    "the total time @xmath169 will be much longer than that of the single spin evolution of eq .",
    "[ eq : ua2 ] as the minimum gap @xmath19 will approach zero as the system size grows ( although remaining nonzero for any finite size ) . the exact rate at which the gap closes will determine the efficiency with which we are able to simulate circuits on single or multiple qudits ( dependent upon the coupling hamiltonian ) and the required time must not increase by more than a polynomial factor for the scheme to be viable .",
    "hence , we require that the gap can be bounded from below by the inverse of a polynomial in the system size , @xmath170 .",
    "there are relatively few techniques for bounding the spectral gap of arbitrary hamiltonians , and so one does not expect to prove efficiency in general for all sp phases .",
    "however , as noted by bacon _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , a proof for a universal gate set would be an important step . for 1d systems",
    "we take a different approach to argue for efficiency , making use of the fact that all ground states of gapped 1d hamiltonians are well approximated by mps  @xcite , and that the circuit to construct an mps is in general linear in the chain length @xmath20 . even under completely symmetric evolution , any sp state ( with an exact mps representation ) can be mapped to a product state by a circuit of depth @xmath171  @xcite by taking the standard circuit to construct the mps representation of the state and applying its inverse .",
    "this circuit will also commute with the symmetry , provided that the mps tensors are symmetric .",
    "furthermore , this scaling should be optimal as we expect one edge must communicate with the other edge to complete the disentangling map to a product state . in principle , then , there could exist @xmath171 length symmetric adiabatic evolutions that map from a trivial phase to a sp phase ( and similarly between sp phases ) .",
    "as such , we expect that generic adiabatic evolutions generated by the application of a field for a period scaling polynomially with the system size @xmath172 will pass from sp to trivial phase , and these may even be as fast as @xmath171 .",
    "another interesting and relevant aspect of the efficiency issue is addressed in the work of dziarmaga and rams  @xcite , investigating the adiabatic traversal of symmetry - breaking phase transitions in one - dimensional quantum spin models . in comparison to the uniform application of a global field driving the system through a phase transition",
    ", it is found that sweeping a spatially - varying field profile sufficiently slowly across a chain leads to a polynomial speed up in the time required for adiabatic traversal .",
    "in addition , the slow sweeping can lead to an exponential suppression in the density of thermal errors .",
    "we expect that similar results should apply at least in the case of an abelian symmetry group with maximally noncommutative factor system  @xcite as there exist locality - preserving mappings between the symmetry broken and sp phases in this case .",
    "this approach may also become natural when trying to implement a full circuit , as we envision sweeping a uniform field sufficiently slowly across a network of spaqts arranged to simulate the circuit so as to only address a number of spaqt gates in parallel at each time step , rather than applying the field simultaneously to the whole complex network ( by sweeping we hope to avoid the kind of trade off described in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the adiabatic sweep can be run in reverse , which could be advantageous if , as is suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the thermal errors generated by the sweeping field propagate ahead of the phase transition wave front .",
    "in this situation , the excitations will be swept away from the edge mode on the sp portion of the chain and into the trivial phase .",
    "the spaqt offers some natural robustness to a variety of errors that could occur in a quantum computation . in this section",
    ", we will survey the various error channels for this scheme , following the outline of the discussion in bacon _",
    "et al . _",
    "see also @xcite for a more thorough analysis of error channels relevant to holonomic adiabatic quantum computation using a many - body ground state .    as our model is technically adiabatic open loop holonomic quantum computation , the result that general holonomic quantum computation can be performed fault - tolerantly  @xcite are relevant , although the construction in ref .",
    "@xcite does not lend itself directly to our framework .",
    "nonetheless , it shows in principle that a holonomic scheme for universal quantum computation such as ours can be made fault tolerant . the question of whether we can design such a fault - tolerant construction while preserving the desirable physical properties of our scheme is open .    as a first requirement , our scheme relies on the existence of robust non - trivial sp phases , for example the haldane phase  @xcite and topological insulators  @xcite , which have been observed in both condensed matter and cold atomic systems .",
    "in particular , we require that sp phases should still exist for small non - symmetric hamiltonian perturbations and small nonzero temperatures .",
    "we note that recent studies have shown that localization through disorder in sp phases can provide some robustness to the fractionalized edge modes  @xcite .",
    "each individual spaqt is inherently thermodynamically protected from all symmetric errors due to the irreducibility of the edge mode representation within the ground space and the energy gap to the excited states . in this sense ,",
    "our encoding is essentially a decoherence free subspace  @xcite for symmetric errors .",
    "this property can be combined with dynamical decoupling pulses  @xcite implementing all global symmetry transformations in order to symmetrize the noise operators to a certain order in perturbation theory . performing such sequences",
    "would then provide thermodynamic protection from these now symmetrized errors , as they must act as the identity on the ground space to the same order of approximation .",
    "however , this scheme may not suit the adiabatic implementation in practice as the dynamic decoupling requires active application of fast pulse sequences to implement global symmetries throughout the evolution .",
    "any errors that have the sole effect of changing the energy eigenspace of the chain during the adiabatic evolution should be equivalent to having an excited state ( or superposition of excited states ) at the end of the computation , where the hamiltonian consists of purely uniform local fields . we restrict our attention to the case of a single excited state , as any superposition can be collapsed by measuring each spin in the basis of the field being applied to it .",
    "we can understand such an error as causing some of the spins to end up in excited eigenstates of this applied field . provided that the eigenspaces of the field are nondegenerate",
    ", the excited state should transform as some irreducible representation @xmath173 of the symmetry .",
    "if we label the excited state by @xmath174 then the effect of this error is precisely to implement the gate @xmath90 in place of the @xmath88 that would have occurred without the error ( there may also be a global phase factor due to the @xmath90 matrices forming a projective representation ) .",
    "upon measuring all the spins in the trivial phase at the end of the evolution , we can in principle determine what excitation errors have occurred during the computation and furthermore collapse a superposition of such errors into the energy eigenbasis of the applied field .",
    "a subtlety we have overlooked thus far is the possibility of a small accidental , adiabatic deformation away from the desired final state of the applied field .",
    "while this would seem easy to suppress in practice by simply applying a stronger uniform local field it does not cause any change in the intended logic gate so long as the deformation is symmetric .",
    "the only effect this may have is to entangle the encoded information at the edge of the sp chain with some spins in the trivial phase near the phase boundary .",
    "this could necessitate some operation to disentangle the logical information , again , measuring the spins in the basis of the applied field should suffice with high probability .      for the remainder of the section , we speculate about some possible fault tolerant properties of the encoding we use at different points in a sp phase .",
    "the ground state encoding is associated to a gapless edge mode and it is known to be localised to the edge in the following sense : there is a renormalisation fixed point of the phase in which the information is strictly localised to a single physical site and as we follow a symmetric , adiabatic path this mode spreads out up to the point where it persists across the majority of the chain at a phase transition .",
    "this implies that the encoding will possess different degrees of inherent robustness to local errors . as noted by bacon _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , at an exact fixed point and at the decoupled end point of the adiabatic evolution in eq .  , the encoded information is essentially as unprotected as a bare qubit .",
    "they propose a solution to this by scheduling the adiabatic evolution to spend a minimal amount of time at the beginning and end of the computation , where the gap is almost constant and the information is unprotected .",
    "they go a step further and conjecture that the encoded information is inherently robust to local errors during the middle of the adiabatic evolution where it is maximally delocalised over the bulk of the chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chaintransistor ] .",
    "we note that even for points in a sp phase that are a constant distance from the fixed point , the encoded information could spread over a constant number of sites that is sufficiently large to protect against errors that act independently on single physical spins .",
    "an analysis of the general case is complicated by the fact that , if the parent hamiltonian consists of commuting terms , then the information lives precisely on the single physical edge spin and is therefore unprotected . hence any inherently robust encoding must have non - commuting hamiltonian terms , and analysing the precise properties of such an encoding would be difficult .",
    "we further propose that during computation , when no measurements are necessary , one should take advantage of the inherent robustness of points in the phase where the edge mode is spread out . in particular we consider starting and finishing the computation at such points , rather than the points with exactly localised encoded information described by eq .  .",
    "finally , we consider the most general nonsymmetric error operators . for a generic hamiltonian in a sp phase , there will be a nontrivial dispersion relation , hence , localized errors will propagate across the chain .",
    "we believe that it should still be possible to deal with these errors by globally cooling the system while sweeping a field to implement the computation . in this case",
    "the errors can only propagate a certain mean path length determined by the temperature of the memoryless cooling reservoir to which the chain is coupled .",
    "then with high probability the region which could possibly be effected by each error is of constant size in time and space and should be uncorrelated with other errors .",
    "hence we expect that such an error should be correctable by simulating standard fault tolerant circuit constructions such as ref .",
    "@xcite with the spaqts .",
    "it may be possible to formalize the above analysis by treating the spin chain as weakly coupled to a bath where the open system dynamics can be described by a master equation .",
    "in some such cases it has been shown that the light cone of information spread can asymptote to a finite region @xcite .",
    "furthermore the presence of some weak disorder in the system could have a similar effect in localizing the excitations caused by errors such that they can be corrected using the procedure described above  @xcite .",
    "we have argued that material properties of sp phases make them natural systems to use when designing adiabatic quantum transistors , in loose analogy to the use of semiconductor materials in building classical transistors .",
    "we have proposed an understanding of the operation of an adiabatic transistor in terms of driving a spin chain through a phase transition from a symmetry - protected phase to a trivial symmetric phase .",
    "this perspective also extends the understanding of hamiltonians that lead to adiabatic quantum transistor gates from finely tuned exact models to whole sp phases of matter , thereby further reducing the control requirements of the scheme .",
    "we would particularly like to highlight the fact that the logical transformations implemented by a spaqt depend only upon symmetry properties that are universal to a whole sp phase .",
    "we further hope that our general approach can be applied to a broad range of situations to characterise useful properties of particular fine tuned parent hamiltonians in terms of more robust and universal properties of whole quantum phases .",
    "finally , we put forward the conjecture that our scheme may be adaptable to exploit the inherent protection of 2d topologically ordered surface states of 3d sp or topological bulk materials @xcite , thus achieving inherent fault tolerance of the information encoded into the edge mode .",
    "we also conjecture that our schemes extends , in a natural way , to currently engineerable topological wires with majorana edge modes  @xcite which are fermionic analogs to the ( bosonic ) sp spin chains studied here .",

    "the states of the spin-@xmath180 boundary degrees of freedom label a fourfold degeneracy ( in the thermodynamic limit ) in the ground states of the spin chain . to be precise",
    "we note that for any finite chain there is a small splitting between the energy eigenvalues of the set of ground states corresponding to the singlet and triplet states of the edge modes .",
    "this splitting decays exponentially as the size of the system grows , while the gap to the first excitation converges to a non - zero value .",
    "this is due to the general property that correlations decay exponentially in gapped ground states , causing the strength of the interaction between the two edge modes to decay accordingly .        as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : spencoding ] , we consider coupling one boundary to a real spin-@xmath180 which possesses a nontrivial , projective representation of the symmetry group with a cohomology class label , inverse to that of the boundary mode .",

    "the product of the emergent mode hilbert space with that of the real spin-@xmath180 is now equivalent to a linear representation of the symmetry .",

    "hence the final state can be written @xmath221 and we see that the encoded @xmath215 state is fixed under this evolution . similarly an initial state @xmath222 evolves to @xmath223 up to another phase .",
    "since the evolution fixes the @xmath215 and @xmath224 states up to possibly different phase factors , it must amount to some rotation about the @xmath132-axis of the bloch sphere , corresponding to the unitary operator @xmath225 up to an irrelevant global phase , and where @xmath226 $ ] .    to calculate the rotation @xmath227 we consider the evolution of the @xmath193 basis under the decoupling , making use of the fact that @xmath228 . for the initial + 1 eigenstate of @xmath229 , the @xmath230 logical state : @xmath231 after decoupling becomes @xmath232 up to a phase factor @xmath233 .",
