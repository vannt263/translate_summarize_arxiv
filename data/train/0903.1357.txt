    "( 2001 ) revealed that its effective temperature lies in the predicted pulsational instability .",
    "therefore , in order to search for pulsations , this star was included in a photometric monitoring programme at the nordic optical telescope ( see ostensen et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "the observations indicated that it was an eclipsing binary ( drechsel et al .",
    "a detailed photometric and spectroscopic investigation was carried out by drechsel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who discovered that hs0705 + 6700 is a detached , short - period eclipsing binary .",
    "absolute parameters of both components were determined suggesting the primary is a subluminous b ( sdb ) star , while the secondary is a cool stellar object that does not contribute to the total optical light apart from a strong reflection effect .",
    "these detections reveal that hs0705 + 6700 is the third one of a small group of hw vir - like eclipsing binary stars that consists of a very hot sdb type primary component and a fully convective m - type secondary with a period between 2 and 3 hours . up to now",
    ", only six of this type of binaries have been discovered ( e.g. , menzies & marang 1986 ; kilkenny et al . 1998 ; drechsel et al .",
    "2001 ; ostensen et al . 2007 ; polubek et al . 2007 ; wils et al .",
    "the hot sdb components in this group of binaries are on the extreme horizontal branch of the hertzsprung - russell diagram , they burn helium in their cores , and have very thin hydrogen envelopes .",
    "they are formed through a common - envelope evolution ( e.g. , han et al . 2003 ) and will evolve into normal cataclysmic variables ( cv ) ( e.g. , shimansky et al .",
    "2006 ) .    as pointed out by qian et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , because of the compact structures and large temperature differences between the components , light curves of this group of binaries show a strong reflection effect with very sharp primary and shallow secondary minima .",
    "therefore , eclipse times can be determined with a high precision ( e.g. , kilkenny et al .",
    "1994 , 2000 ) , and very small - amplitude orbital period variations could be detected by analyzing the observed - calculated ( o - c ) diagram .",
    "orbital period variations of hw vir , the prototype of this group of systems , were discovered ( e.g. , kilkenny et al . 1994 ; qian et al .",
    "2008a ; lee et al .",
    "2009 ) , which show a combination of a cyclic variation and a long - term period decrease .",
    "the cyclic variation suggests the presence of a brown dwarf tertiary companion in the system , while the continuous decrease can be explained as secular angular momentum loss via magnetic braking of the fully convective component star or as a part of another long - period cyclic change via the existence of another companion . to search for the variations in the orbital period of hs0705",

    "drechsel et al .",

    ", it was monitored from december , 2006 to december , 2008 by using four telescopes in china and poland ( the 85-cm and the 60-cm telescopes in xinglong station of national astronomical observatories ( nao ) , and the 60-cm mt . suhora and the 50-cm krakow telescopes in poland ) .",
    "38 eclipse times were obtained and they are listed in table 1 .",

    "the corresponding @xmath6 diagram is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where our 38 new minima times and the other 31 eclipse times collected from the sources noted above .    as shown in figure 1 , the linear component of the orbital period of hs0705 + 6700 needs revision and it appears that there is a cyclic variation as well . to describe the general @xmath6 trend satisfactorily ,",
    "a new linear ephemeris is required ( dashed line in fig .",
    "1 ) with additional cyclic variations superimposed . using the least squares method , we determined , @xmath7.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derived orbital period is slightly shorter than that determined by drechsel et al .",
    "the cyclic oscillation has an amplitude of 92.4 seconds and a period of 7.15 years . during the analysis , two timings of light minima , hjd2451957.5274 and hjd2454706.50400 ,",
    "were not used because their @xmath6 values show large scatter when compared with the general trend formed by the other data points .",
    "actually , the eclipse minimum , hjd2451957.5274 , has been deleted by drechsel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) too , in their analysis .",
    "the @xmath8 values calculated with the new linear ephemeris are plotted in the upper panel of figure 2 where the cyclic change is seen more clearly .",
    "after the periodic change was subtracted from the @xmath8 curve , the residuals are displayed in the lower panel where no variations can be found indicating that equation ( 2 ) gives a good fit to the @xmath6 curve .",
    "( @xmath1 ) and the orbital radius @xmath9 ( au ) of the tertiary component and its orbital inclination @xmath10 in the hs0705 + 6700 system .",
    "the tertiary companion should be a brown dwarf when the orbital inclination is larger than @xmath11 , while the orbital radius @xmath9 of the tertiary component is always less than 3.6au . ]",
    "one cause of cyclic period change could be the magnetic activity cycles of the fully convective component ( i. e. , the applegate mechanism ) ( applegate 1992 ) .",
    "it is assumed in the mechanism that a certain amount of angular momentum is periodically exchanged between the inner and the outer parts of the convection zone , and therefore the rotational oblateness and thus the orbital period will vary when the cool component goes through its activity cycles . as in the cases of hw vir and",
    "nn ser ( qian et al . 2008a ; brinkworth et al .",
    "2005 ) , the fully convective secondary in hs0705 + 6700 rotates mainly as a rigid body , and lacks the thin interface layer between a radiative core and a convective envelope , where dynamo processes are thought to concentrate at for solar - type stars ( e.g. , barnes 2005 ) .",
    "the analyses for hw vir and nn ser indicated that the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of the m - type components , suggesting , that the mechanism of applegate can not interpret the cyclic period variations of the two systems .",
    "moreover , as discussed by qian et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) , a more general explanation of the cyclic period changes in close binaries would be the light - travel time effect via the presence of a third body .",
    "therefore , we analyzed hs0705 + 6700 for the light - time effect that arises from the gravitational influence of a third companion .",
    "the presence of a tertiary body produces the relative distance changes of the eclipsing pair as it orbits the barycenter of the triple system .",
    "since the sine fit seems quite good , we assumed the orbit of the third body to be circular . with the absolute parameters determined by drechsel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we derived the mass function and the mass of the tertiary companion as : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the relations between the mass @xmath14 and the orbital radius @xmath9 of the tertiary component and its orbital inclination @xmath10 are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "when the orbital inclination of the third body is larger than @xmath11 , the mass of the tertiary component corresponds to @xmath15 . in this case , the tertiary component can not undergo a stable hydrogen burning in the core , and it should be a brown dwarf . therefore , with 63.6% probability , the third body is a substellar object ( by assuming a random distribution of orbital plane inclination ) .",
    "however , depending on the unknown orbital inclination of the third body , a low - mass , stellar companion can not be totally excluded but with a lower possibility of 36.4% .",
    "hs0705 + 6700 has passed through the phase of a common envelope ( ce ) after the more massive component star in the original system evolves into a red giant .",
    "the ejection of ce removed a large amount of the angular momentum , and the present , short - period sdb - type binary has been formed . as it is shown in figure 3 ,",
    "the orbital radius @xmath9 of the tertiary component is smaller than 3.6au .",
    "the detection of a brown dwarf or a very low - mass stellar companion in hs0705 + 6700 at this distance , could give some constraints on the stellar evolution and the interaction between red giants and their companions .",
    "apart from cyclic period changes , a long - term period decrease was discovered in hw vir that can be plausibly explained by secular angular momentum loss via magnetic braking of its fully convective component ( qian et al .",
    "2008a ; lee et al .",
    "if this is true , a long - term period decrease could be discovered in hs0705 + 6700 .",
    "actually , as displayed in figure 1 , the @xmath6 diagram can also be described by a combination of a cyclic change and a long - term period decrease . to check wether",
    "a long - term period decrease exists or not , more times of light minimum are required in the future .",
