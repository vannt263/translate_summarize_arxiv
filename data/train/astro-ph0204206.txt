    "for smooth , non - singular lenses , it is well - known that the total number of images is odd and that the number of even parity images exceeds the number of odd parity images by one ( e.g. , burke 1981 ; schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 , chap . 5 ) . when the source lies within both the tangential and radial caustics , it is lensed into 5 images . when the source lies outside one caustic but inside the other ,",
    "then it is lensed into 3 images .",
    "if the surface density at the galaxy centre is cusped and that cusp is stronger than isothermal , then the situation changes .",
    "there is no radial caustic and there are either 4 or 2 images depending on whether the source lies inside or outside the remaining tangential caustic ( evans & wilkinson 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , almost all the known sixty or so gravitational lens systems are 2 or 4 image configurations ( see pospieszalka et al .",
    "1999 for details of the gravitational lensing database which maintains a list of candidates ) .",
    "there are two systems in which the presence of a weak , central image has been claimed .",
    "apm08279 + 5255 is an ultraluminous broad absorption line quasar .",
    "originally , two images were detected serendipitously by irwin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the optical .",
    "subsequently , ibata et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found convincing evidence for a central third image using higher resolution infrared imaging .",
    "the source of mg1131 + 0456 is a radio galaxy .",
    "one extended radio component is lensed into a ring , another is lensed into two images",
    ". there seems to be a weak central image at the center of the ring , and this may be the third or fifth image of parts of the background radio source ( chen & hewitt 1993 ) ; however , this could also be emission from the lensing galaxy .",
    "the almost total absence of the central image from the known lens systems sets strong constraints on the core radius and the steepness of the lensing potential ( e.g. , narayan , blandford & nityananda 1984 , wallington & narayan 1993 , rusin & ma 2000 ) .",
    "the aims of this paper are twofold . on the theoretical side ,",
    "our aim is to find expressions for the sums of the magnifications of any subset of the images produced by multiply lensed quasars or galaxies , at least within the framework of a class of flexible and popular models .",
    "we do this by extending the analysis of our earlier work ( hunter & evans 2001 , henceforth paper i ) to lensing potentials stratified on similar concentric ellipse but this time with cores . in doublet ( or quadruplet ) systems , there are one ( or two ) even parity images , one ( or two ) odd parity images , together with the missing central image .",
    "we provide contour integrals which find the sums of the magnifications of the even parity images , the odd parity images and the central image separately . on the astrophysical side ,",
    "our aim is to set constraints on the cusp profile and core size of lensing galaxies by requiring that the central image be too weak to be detectable .",
    "for the 2 and 4 image systems , we investigate the permissible core radius as a function of the steepness and the flattening of the lensing potential and the external shear .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 develops the contour integral representation needed for lensing potentials that are elliptically stratified .",
    "section 3 specialises the analysis to models in which the lensing potential is a power - law of the elliptic radius combined with external shear of arbitrary orientation .",
    "the conditions for triple and quintuple imaging are found in terms of the depth and shape of the potential , as well as the position of the source .",
    "the contour integrals for the sums of the magnifications of the two even parity , the two odd parity and the missing central image are evaluated .",
    "section 4 uses monte carlo simulations to set limits on the lensing potential by requiring the central image to be unobservable .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "this section develops contour integrals for computing the magnifications of images assuming only that the lensing potential is stratified on similar concentric ellipses .      in this paper",
    ", we always assume that the lensing potential @xmath11 is stratified on similar concentric ellipses with constant axis ratio @xmath1 with @xmath12 so that @xmath13 for a thin lens with potential @xmath11 , the lens equation is ( e.g. , schneider et al . ,",

    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 allow for a constant external shear in an arbitrary direction .",
    "we always assume that the lens is not circularly symmetric ( that is , either @xmath18 or @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) .",
    "complex numbers often simplify calculations in lensing theory ( e.g. , bourassa , kantowski & norton 1973 , bourassa & kantowski 1975 , witt 1990 , rhie 1997 ) . as in paper",

    "once a solution for @xmath30 is found , the image positions are given by equation ( [ eq : zzetarel ] ) .",
    "any solution of the original lens equation ( [ eq : original ] ) gives a solution of the imaging equation .",
    "however , the imaging equation may have negative real or complex solutions which do not correspond to true images .",

    "the reciprocal of the determinant of the jacobian of the mapping from the real @xmath37lens plane to the @xmath38source plane corresponds physically to the signed magnification of an image ( schneider et al .",

    "images correspond to simple zeros of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the residue of @xmath52 at a simple zero .",
    "we continue the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : defmag ] ) into the complex @xmath30-plane and write the sum of the signed magnifications of the images as the contour integral @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is a contour in the complex @xmath30-plane which excludes @xmath55 and encloses only the simple poles corresponding to whichever visible images we wish to analyse .",
    "let us note that our analysis here shows how the methods first developed in paper i can do more than we achieved there .",
    "we here exploit them in two new ways .",
    "we first relax the restriction that the lensing potential be scale - free and allow it to have a core .",
    "cored potentials produce either one , three , or five images depending on the strength of the potential , the size of the core and the position of the source .",
    "second , we derive formulae for sums of signed magnifications for separate image pairs , and for the central image . hence , the present results are more detailed and informative than those of paper i , most of which were for sums over the four bright images , consisting of two pairs of opposite parity , and which therefore partially cancel .",
    "we now specialize the analysis to the case of power - law galaxies with a core radius @xmath3 , which have the lensing potential @xmath56 these models were first studied by blandford & kochanek ( 1989 ) in the context of gravitational lensing ( see also kassiola & kovner 1993 ; witt 1996 ; witt & mao 1997 , 2000 ; evans & wilkinson 1998 and paper i ) .",
    "they are the projections of three - dimensional power - law galaxies familiar in galactic astronomy and dynamics ( evans 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "for example , they have been used to model the nearby elliptical galaxy m32 ( van der marel et al . 1994 ) , the inner parts of the galactic bulge ( evans & de zeeuw 1994 ) , as well as the dark halo of our own galaxy in the interpretation of both the sagittarius stream and the microlensing results ( alcock et al .",

    "specifically , we scale all lengths by @xmath62 .",

    "the dependence of our results on @xmath61 , which is needed in applications , can be recovered by multiplying all powers of @xmath3 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and their conjugates by the same powers of @xmath62 .      in this section ,",
    "we establish the conditions for the numbers and types of images , and the forms of the caustics .",
    "it is convenient to use the variable @xmath64 .",
    "it reduces to the same variable @xmath65 used in paper i in the limit of no core ( @xmath66 ) . when there is a core , the physically relevant range of @xmath65 is restricted to @xmath67 . in terms of the variable @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath68 the imaging equation ( [ eq : defnk ] ) requires the balance @xmath69 for those real and positive values of @xmath65 at which the images occur .",

    "both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are positive with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig : chrisone ] shows how image positions can be found graphically by plotting separately the two sides of equation ( [ eq : tbalance ] ) .",
    "the full curve represents the right hand side of that equation .",
    "it depends only on the parameters of the lens .",
    "the left hand side depends also on the position of the source .",
    "the three dashed curves display it for three different source positions .",
    "the lowest dashed curve intersects the full curve curve five times and there are five images . when the source is sufficiently close to the center of the galaxy , the left hand side remains small until it rises to its asymptote at @xmath78 .",
    "a requirement for quintuple imaging is that @xmath70 must lie to the left of this asymptote , and hence that the core radius must satisfy @xmath79 .",
    "images disappear in pairs either when the two curves touch in the @xmath80 interval , which corresponds to a crossing of the tangential caustic , or when they touch in the @xmath81 interval , which corresponds to a crossing of the radial caustic .",
    "if the former happens first , then the three images that remain form a `` core triplet '' ; if the latter happens first , then the three images form a `` naked cusp triplet '' ( e.g. , kassiola & kovner 1993 ) .",

    "[ fig : chrisone ] represents a naked cusp triplet case of a source which lies outside the radial caustic but inside the tangential one .",
    "the topmost dashed curve is for a source which lies outside both caustics , and gives a single image .",

    "the three different source positions are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : christwo]a .    the maximum number of images diminishes as the core radius increases .",

    "there are then three images for the source sufficiently close to the center of the galaxy that it lies within the tangential caustic , and there is no radial caustic . for still larger core radii satisfying @xmath84 ,",
    "then only a single image can occur and there are no caustics . appendix a justifies the statements concerning images and caustics , and gives equations for determining the caustics , and an approximate formula for the radial caustic for small @xmath3 and @xmath85 .",
    "image positions and points on caustics must generally be determined numerically .",
    "cusps are an exception because they occur in pairs when either @xmath86 or @xmath87 is a triple root of the imaging equation .",
    "the sole caustic is tangential and of lips type for the range @xmath88 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : christwo]c because it has only the @xmath86 pair of cusps .",
    "when @xmath89 and quintuple imaging is possible , there are two pairs of cusps and three possible configurations of caustics . either both pairs of cusps lie on the tangential caustic , which is of astroidal shape , or else both caustics are lips - shaped with the radial caustic lying within the tangential and oriented oppositely to it ( schneider et al . 1992 ,",

    "this double lips configuration occurs when @xmath90 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : christwo]a .",

    "[ fig : christhree ] .",
    "the tangential caustic has a pair of naked cusps in the regions of parameter space below the curve for the appropriate value of @xmath91 . above that curve , the tangential caustic has four cusps and lies wholly within the radial caustic as in fig .",
    "[ fig : christwo]b .",
    "below that curve , but where @xmath92 is sufficiently large that the condition ( [ eq : twolips ] ) is violated , the two caustics intersect as in fig .",
    "[ fig : christwo]d , and two of the four cusps of the tangential caustic are naked .",
    "we note that our results extend previous calculations in the literature .",
    "for example , kassiola & kovner ( 1993 ) give the conditions for multiple imaging in the isothermal case ( @xmath93 ) in the absence of shear ( @xmath94 ) , while evans & wilkinson ( 1998 ) give the results for the scale - free cases ( @xmath95 ) with on - axis shear only ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "i , we were interested primarily in sums over the four bright images",

    "however , the sum of series ( [ eq : directseries ] ) and ( [ eq : invertedseries ] ) can remain convergent at the tangential caustic because the infinities of the signed magnifications of the two merging images cancel .",
    "the series ( [ eq : invertedseries ] ) ceases to converge at the radial caustic where an inverted and a doubly inverted image merge , but the series ( [ eq : directseries ] ) for the direct images converges there if , as in fig .",

    "an example is the cored isothermal lens of fig .",
    "[ fig : christwo]b .",
    "the sum of the four signed magnifications is constant to within tenths of one percent over all of the region inside the tangential caustic except very close to the cusps .",
    "however , the smallness of the dependence of that sum on the source position is due to a near - cancellation of the correction terms in the two image sums .",

    "the sums @xmath145 for the same sets of indices are -0.01 .",
    "though numerical values vary , @xmath145 is typically at least two orders of magnitude less than @xmath146 for lenses with small cores and with an inner tangential caustic . in section b.3",
    ", we show how near - cancellation can occur more generally from the contour integral formula ( [ eq : tautheorem ] ) , and is not a peculiarity of power - law galaxies . however , this behavior is not universal .",
    "the sum of the four signed magnifications has large variations over the region inside the inner radial caustic of fig .",
    "[ fig : christwo]a , while the sum of the magnifications of the two direct images changes little in the middle third of that region .",

    "the minimum magnification @xmath147 in the scale - free limit @xmath148 is @xmath149 this corresponds to the case when the source is aligned with the center of the lensing galaxy .",

    "the contour integral method can also be used to calculate configuration moments , that is , sums over the images of products of the signed magnifications with position coordinates .",
    "those sums are obtained by adding the complex position coordinates from ( [ eq : zzetarel ] ) to the sum ( [ eq : tautheorem ] ) to obtain @xmath151 we expand for moments in the same manner as for the magnifications , with the result that @xmath152^{m+j } [ \\barlam(t_2-t)+\\barnu(t_1-t)]^{n+j}dt           \\over[(t - t_1)(t - t_2)]^{2j+m+n+1}(1-a^2t^b)^{j+1}}.\\ ] ] after the two numerator factors are expanded binomially , we see that every integral is of the same form as ( [ eq : rtwodefn ] ) , and so , provided @xmath153 and @xmath154 , we obtain @xmath155 the corresponding sum for the indirect pair is @xmath156 in either case the same @xmath157 and @xmath146 functions as arise with the magnifications , and which are evaluated in appendix b , are all that is needed .    whereas the present paper is mostly concerned with magnifications , our modeling in paper i made use of configuration moments too .",
    "the analysis of this paper , and especially that of appendix section b.3 , shows that four - image sums of moments may also be far more uniform than the separate sums ( [ eq : dirconfigsum ] ) and ( [ eq : invconfigsum ] ) because of cancellations .",

    "off - axis shear rotates the configuration and @xmath175 is then the complex factor which makes @xmath176 real .",

    "models steeper than isothermal have @xmath219 , models shallower than isothermal have @xmath220 .",
    "there are a number of things to notice in fig .",
    "[ fig : wynzero ] . as the core radius @xmath3 is diminished , the rgime in which the central image is visible shrinks .",
    "visible central images occur only for @xmath207 when the central image is stronger as the simple estimate @xmath221 from  3.4 predicts .",
    "the full curves for the flattened ( @xmath222 ) models lie above the dashed curves for the rounder ( @xmath223 ) models .",
    "this is due to a stronger dimming of the brightest image with increasing flattening which outpaces the dimming of the central image .",
    "all magnifications share a @xmath224-dependence which comes from the basic magnification formula ( [ eq : ttheorem ] ) .",
    "the brightest image is direct for vanishing shear and zero source offset , and has magnification @xmath225 .",
    "hence we estimate the ratio of the central image to the brightest image at zero source offset to be @xmath226 .",
    "this ratio increases with increasing flattening . for small @xmath3 ,",
    "the magnification of the central image does not vary greatly with increasing source offset within the quintuplet region for @xmath85 .",

    "[ fig : chrisfive ] varies little .",
    "conversely , the brightest image strengthens considerably with increasing source offset as it gets closer to the tangential caustic .",
    "the result is that the ratio @xmath227 of central to brightest magnifications decreases with increasing source offset for @xmath85 . for @xmath207 on the other hand",
    ", @xmath199 grows so strongly across the quintuplet region that it can outpace the growth of @xmath228 .",
    "the net result is that the flatter the potential , and the larger the core radius , then the greater is the likelihood that the central image is bright enough to be visible .",
    "[ fig : wynone ] shows the raw probability of observing a central image for core triplets .",
    "the behavior of the curves as a function of slope index @xmath216 has the following explanation . if @xmath216 is too large , then the central image is highly demagnified and so the raw probability is vanishingly small .",
    "as the slope index @xmath216 diminishes , the central image becomes brighter and the probability rises quickly to @xmath229 .",
    "the brightest image is generally the remaining direct one .",
    "it dims with increasing source offset whereas the central image brightens .",
    "the tangential caustic also grows in size as @xmath1 decreases for constant slope index .",
    "that is the main reason why central images are more visible with increased flattening for @xmath207 ; the average source offset in the core triplet region between the tangential and radial caustics is then larger , and hence @xmath199 is significantly larger .",
    "as @xmath216 decreases further , the astroidal tangential caustic grows , and the area in the source plane generating core triplets diminishes and eventually vanishes , as the tangential caustic becomes larger than the radial caustic as in fig .",
    "[ fig : christwo]c .",
    "the smaller @xmath1 is , the sooner this happens and , as fig .",
    "[ fig : wynone ] shows , the size of the core has little effect on the stage at which the core triplet region disappears .",
    "the second and third terms of the inequality ( [ eq : twolips ] ) become equal at that stage and , in the absence of shear , @xmath216 is then @xmath230 ( see appendix a ) . if the core radius @xmath231 , then even models steeper than isothermal ( @xmath6 ) can provide observable central images . for smaller core radii ( @xmath232 ) , the visible central images are confined to models less steep than isothermal .",
    "notice that the constraints on the maximum possible steepness of the lensing potential provided by the missing image are stronger for doublets than quadruplets once @xmath233 . for small core radii ,",
    "the fifth image in quintuplet systems is significantly more demagnified than the third image in triplet systems .",
    "however , for larger core radii , it is the quadruplets that provide the stronger restriction .",
    "[ fig : wyntwo ] shows the raw probability of observing a central image for naked cusp triplets .",
    "naked cusps are much less abundant for elliptic potentials as opposed to elliptic densities ( kassiola & kovner 1993 ) .",
    "almost as soon as naked cusps appear , all three images are of roughly similar brightness and they are all detectable . hence , the raw probability of observing a central image shows a swift transition from nearly @xmath234 to nearly @xmath229 as soon as naked cups become possible .",
    "the monte carlo results are consistent with the transitions given in fig .",
    "[ fig : christhree ] .",
    "equations ( [ eq : nakedness ] ) predict that the transitions occur at the values @xmath235 for @xmath209 and @xmath236 for @xmath237 .",
    "there are no strong observational candidates for naked cusp triplets , and so we must conclude that fig .  [",
    "fig : wyntwo ] sets a firm lower limit on the slope index @xmath216",
    ". this must be larger than the critical value which permits naked cusps ( given in fig .",
    "[ fig : christhree ] ) , otherwise naked cusps would be common .    to compare with data from surveys ,",
    "we must allow for the amplification bias .",
    "lens systems with a high total magnification @xmath238 are preferentially included in a flux - limited survey ( e.g. , turner 1980 , turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) .",
    "the flux distribution of the sources in class is well described by @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the number of sources with flux greater than @xmath241 ( rusin & tegmark 2001 ) . for a flux limited sample ,",
    "the probabilities that take into account amplification bias are @xmath242^{1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath243 denotes the area enclosed by the caustics in the source plane for which the central image passes the threshold ( e.g. , rusin & ma 2001 ) .",
    "[ fig : wynfour ] is the analogue of fig .",
    "[ fig : wynone ] when amplification bias is taken into account .",
    "only the rightmost branch of the curve is plotted , as this is the most relevant for constraining the core size and the slope index .",
    "notice that the effects of the amplification bias cause only slight changes in the shapes of the curves .",
    "once the core radius falls below @xmath244 , then irrespective of the flattening , the lensing potential is constrained to be at least as steep as isothermal to ensure that the fraction of triplets with an observable central image remains low .",
    "[ fig : wynfive ] shows , this conclusion remains valid even in the presence of shear .",
    "shear has little direct effect on the magnitude of the central image as equation ( [ eq : muasum ] ) , which is independent of shear , predicts .",
    "however , shears of the order of 0.1 cause the inner tangential caustic to grow significantly in size for the @xmath216 values at which the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : wynfive ] rise sharply , while the radial caustic merely tilts a little .",
    "the greater visibility of the central image is again because the average source offset in the diminished core triplet region has become larger , now as a result of shear .",
    "the total shear produced by internal misalignments , large - scale structure and neighboring galaxies is typically constrained by @xmath245 .",
    "what restriction is implied on the core radius @xmath3 from the data on radio lenses ?",
    "the class survey found no triples , but 7 doublets .",
    "there is perhaps only 1 definite triple system ( apm08279 + 5255 ) out of a total of @xmath246 doublets and triplets on pospieszalka et al.s gravitational lensing database ( which contains both radio and optical lenses ) .",
    "so , the probability of detecting a triple with an observable central image is certainly very low . in this paper",
    ", we take it to be @xmath247 for radio lenses ( i.e. , at the @xmath248 threshold ) . using fig .",
    "[ fig : wynfour ] , the top left panel showing curves for @xmath249 suggests that detectable central images are common for isothermal ( or nearly so ) galaxies .",
    "the smallest core radius @xmath3 seemingly compatible with the missing central images is @xmath244 if the galaxy is isothermal . at a typical lens redshift of @xmath250 and a typical source redshift @xmath251",
    ", this corresponds to a physical size of @xmath252 pc ( using formula ( 11 ) of young et al .",

    "the result holds good for a flat , matter - dominated friedman - robertson - walker universe with a hubble constant @xmath253 .",
    "suppose instead we use the currently popular cosmological model in which @xmath254 of the mean energy density required to make space flat is in the form of material for which gravity acts repulsively and the remaining @xmath255 is carried by collisionless massive particles of some type .",

    "this gives physical sizes of the core radius of @xmath259 pc and @xmath260 pc respectively , consistent with almost all the central images being absent .",

    "they provide convincing evidence that giant elliptical galaxies have cuspy cores with steep outer power - law profiles and shallow inner profiles separated by a break radius .",
    "this is in contrast to low luminosity ellipticals , which have power - law surface brightness profiles .",
    "there are 26 giant ellipticals with cuspy cores presented in table  2 of faber et al .",
    "the mean value of the asymptotic outer slope of the surface brightness is @xmath261 with a standard deviation of @xmath262 .",

    "the mean break radius is @xmath263 pc , which corresponds to only a few tens of millarcseconds at a typical lens redshift of @xmath264 .",
    "the bright images of strong lenses are therefore probing the steep outer part of the cuspy core profile .",
    "the light profile is much steeper than isothermal ; however , the projected mass may be less steep depending on the distribution of dark matter .",
    "central images are absent because break radii are small in cuspy core galaxies and so the steep slope continues to small radii .",
    "in fact , only 2 out of the 26 galaxies listed by faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have a sufficiently shallow profile for the central image to stand any chance of being visible at the @xmath265 threshold .",
    "this provides an explanation of why most central images are unobservable at the current thresholds .",
    "other than a central black hole , there is little evidence for dark matter inside the inner 10 kpc of early - type galaxies that can not be simply assigned to the stellar mass ( e.g. , gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ) . beyond 10 kpc or so , there probably is dark matter , although there are few hard facts on its distribution in ellipticals because of the absence of tracers at large radii .",
    "the dynamical evidence refers to the mass within spheres , whereas lensing is concerned with the mass within cylinders .",
    "dark matter at large radii may alter the slope of the projected mass distribution in the inner few kpc .",

    "[ fig : wynsix ] shows the percentage of triplets with a visible central image as a function of the threshold for four different slope indices .",
    "notice that for models with slopes steeper than isothermal , flattening typically makes the central image less visible , the reverse of the case when the slope is weak .",
    "the latter case shows the same trends as in the @xmath266 panel of fig .",

    "the radial caustic is large when @xmath267 and the tangential caustic occupies a much smaller part of the space within it .",
    "both @xmath199 and @xmath228 now decrease as @xmath1 decreases , but @xmath199 decreases faster to make the central image less visible .",
    "[ fig : wynsix ] shows us that the fraction of detectable images is a strong function of the threshold .",
    "it enables us to predict the threshold required to find the missing central images . using the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : wynsix ] as typical of the outer parts of cuspy core profiles , we see that the threshold has to be @xmath268 for the central image to be detectable in half the triplet systems .",
    "even the most sensitive class radio map ( for b0218 + 357 ) probes only to a threshold of @xmath269 , so this provides an explanation of why the central images have so far remained missing despite deeper searches .",
    "we have shown how contour integration can ease the evaluation of the magnifications of images .",
    "this work extends the ideas presented in hunter & evans ( 2001 ) in two significant ways .",
    "first , our earlier analysis was restricted to scale - free power - law potentials .",
    "we have now generalized it to cover all elliptically stratified potentials .",
    "second , we have obtained separate formulas for sums of the two direct images , for sums of the two inverted images , and for the magnification of the central image .",
    "previously , we found only formulas for sums over all four images weighted with the signed magnifications .",
    "our detailed applications are to power - law galaxies with cores .",
    "we have shown that the caustics are then always simple closed curves , and have given conditions for each of the four different caustic configurations .",
    "we have found an approximation for the magnitude of the central image which applies throughout the region inside the large outer radial caustic when the core is small and the slope index @xmath270 . for small cores and weaker cusps , that approximation is directly useful only in a smaller inner region , but shows the magnitude of the central image to grow on a short length scale .",
    "we find that , for power - law lenses with small cores and an inner tangential caustic , the sums over separate pairs vary considerably with the image positions while the signed sums over all four images are generally remarkably uniform . that near - uniformity is a consequence of large cancellations between terms which vary with the position of the source .",
    "hence uncertainties in the magnification can have major effects on estimates of those four image sums .",
    "this lessens their usefulness for the modeling of lenses as proposed by witt & mao ( 2000 ) and as used also by us in our paper i. we have shown that similar large cancellations can arise with any elliptically stratified potential , and not just power - laws .",
    "hence , they will occur also with elliptically stratified densities in the limit of low eccentricity , and perhaps more generally , though this needs to be verified .    as an application",
    ", we have examined the constraints implied by the missing central images of triplet and quintuplet systems .",
    "there is only one convincing example of a gravitational lens system with a central image , namely the triplet of the ultraluminous quasar apm08279 + 5255 .",
    "however , there are a total of @xmath246 doublets known .",
    "although this is a heterogeneous sample , discovered by different observers using different techniques in different wavebands , nonethless the probability of detecting central images does seem to be very low .",
    "we take a central image as observable if the magnification ratio of the faintest to the brightest image is @xmath271 ( although some of the lens systems studied with the highest sensitivity by class do go deeper ) .",
    "a rough summary of the observations is that the probability of observing a central image for a triplet is @xmath272 .",
    "the absence of central images is understandable if the mass distribution in the lensing galaxy population is nearly cusped , and the cusp is isothermal or stronger . for typical source and lens redshifts",

    "the slope of the gravitational potential @xmath4 must be @xmath7 .    most of the optical depth to strong lensing resides in the most massive galaxies , namely giant ellipticals . we know from high resolution imaging of nearby giant ellipticals that they typically have cuspy cores with @xmath9 or @xmath273 outside the break radius of a few hundred parsecs ( faber et al .",
