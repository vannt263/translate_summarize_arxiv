    "many pieces of evidence are consistent with the merging hypothesis ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have argued that a combination of dissipative and dissipationless processes is needed to match the observed properties of early - type galaxies .",
    "dissipation is needed for example to create the high density regions and close to isothermal density profiles , while dissipationless ( or `` dry '' ) mergers are needed to grow the most massive galaxies while preserving the uniformly old stellar populations and the structural properties of present - day galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , both theories and observations have suggested that a large fraction of the immediate progenitors of today s massive red galaxies could be spheroidal galaxies themselves ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , even though mergers may not be the only process at work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dry mergers might play an important role , especially at relatively recent times , i.e. below redshift @xmath11 , after the bulk of star formation is completed for massive early - type galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we take advantage of a new set of constraints provided by strong gravitational lensing studies to test the viability of the dry - merger scenario via a set of numerical simulations . in practice , we first construct realistic models of early - type galaxies so that they obey known scaling relations between their structural and kinematic properties , and then study how these properties change as a result of dissipationless mergers .",
    "our approach is similar to that followed by @xcite , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "the bottom line of these studies is that dry merging between progenitor spheroidal galaxies that lie on the fp , @xcite and @xcite relations produce spheroidal galaxies that are close to the edge - on fp , but deviate from the kormendy and faber - jackson relations , because they have too large effective radius and too low central velocity dispersion .",
    "taking a step further , we focus here on lensing - derived properties , testing the results of our simulations against : i ) isothermality of the total mass density profile ; ii ) the correlations between lensing mass and size or stellar velocity dispersion ; iii ) the mass plane , i.e. the correlation between surface mass density , effective radius and velocity dispersion discovered by strong lensing studies .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the lensing constraints add a qualitatively new piece of information  an accurate aperture mass for each galaxy  that helps circumvent some of the problems inherent to previous studies .",
    "the comparison of n - body simulation with traditional scaling relations is not straightforward , because it relies on assumptions on the mass - to - light ratio to convert luminosity , which enters the observed correlations , into mass .",
    "moreover , among the quantities involved in the traditional empirical correlations ( e.g. , galaxy luminosity , size , and velocity dispersion ) , only velocity dispersion is affected by the galaxy dark matter ( hereafter dm ) content and distribution .",
    "information coming from gravitational lensing , and thus constraining the total galaxy mass distribution , effectively solves this problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in   [ sec : obs ] we review the lensing constraints on the structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "then , in   [ secsim ] , we describe the seed - galaxy models , initial orbital configurations , and numerical methods that we use to simulate the dry - merging process . in   [ sec : tden ] and   [ sec : lens ] we present the results of comparisons between our merger simulations and observations in terms of the effect of dry mergers on density profiles , central dm fractions and scaling relations of galaxies throughout the merging hierarchies . in   [ sec : highz ] we discuss our results in the context of the redshift evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "finally ,   [ seccon ] presents our conclusions .",
    "the properties of massive early - type galaxies are strongly constrained by the combination of kinematic and strong gravitational lensing observations .",
    "in particular , there is growing evidence that these systems have total mass density profile close to isothermal @xmath12 over a large radial interval @xcite , with an intrinsic scatter in logarithmic slope of less than @xmath13% @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite , using a sample of strong gravitational lenses , have shown that early - type galaxies lie on a mass plane ( mp ) @xmath14 where @xmath4 is the projected velocity dispersion within an aperture radius @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the surface mass density within @xmath15 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and rms orthogonal scatter of 1.24 when normalized by the observational errors .",
    "the mp is the gravitational lensing analogue of the traditional fp .",
    "the fact that @xmath19 are consistent with @xmath20 and that the scatter is small can be expressed in terms of structural and dynamical homology of the lenses , by defining the dimensionless structure parameter @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total projected mass within @xmath15 . for their sample of lens early - type galaxies from the sloan lens acs ( slacs ) survey , @xcite find on average @xmath23 we note that the observed scatter on @xmath24 is 0.08 , but here we consider the estimated intrinsic scatter 0.057 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , @xcite find that @xmath25 has no systematic variation with galaxy mass : this is the sense in which the lens galaxies form a homologous family .",
    "in the present paper we also consider the analogues of the traditional luminosity ",
    "size @xcite and luminosity  velocity - dispersion @xcite relations , by deriving the projected - mass  size and the projected - mass  velocity - dispersion relation for the slacs sample of lenses .    to derive total - mass versions of the kormendy and faber - jackson relations , we use the velocity - dispersion , half - light radius , and lensing - mass measurements for the slacs strong - lens sample as published in @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to the 57 lens systems wherein the lens galaxy has early - type morphology and single multiplicity . for the mass ",
    "velocity dispersion relation , we further restrict ourselves to the 53 systems for which the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopy is of sufficient signal - to - noise to permit a velocity - dispersion measurement .",
    "@xcite provide lensing measurements using both singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) and light - traces - mass ( ltm ) models for the mass density of the foreground lensing galaxies , which can be used to gauge the dependence of results upon the radial mass - density profile used to extract the strong - lensing aperture masses .",
    "taking the sie aperture masses as our reference values , and fitting for the relation that minimizes the orthogonal scatter in logarithmic space , we find a mass  size relationship given by @xmath26 the observed scatter in @xmath27 at fixed mass is 0.051 , which is reduced to 0.048 by subtracting in quadrature the error in @xmath27 as estimated by @xcite to obtain an estimate of the intrinsic scatter in this quantity .",
    "we note that there will be a degree of covariance between the axes of this relation , since the measured @xmath3 is used to evaluate the aperture - mass of the sie model at @xmath28 to obtain @xmath22 .",
    "fitting similarly for the mass  velocity - dispersion relation , we find @xmath29 this has an observed scatter in @xmath30 at fixed mass of 0.045 , implying an intrinsic scatter of 0.034 .",
    "errors in all coefficients are computed from the rms scatter in fits to 1000 bootstrap - resampling draws of 57 or 53 galaxies apiece .",
    "using ltm lensing aperture masses instead of those from sie models , the coefficients of both relations change only insignificantly .",
    "these relations are shown in fig .",
    "[ rvm ] .    as discussed in several papers @xcite the slacs lenses",
    "are found to be indistinguishable from control samples of sdss galaxies with the same stellar velocity dispersion and size , in terms of luminosity / surface brightness , location on the fp , and distribution of environments .",
    "we will thus assume that , within the range of observational errors , results found for the lens sample , including the mp , are generic properties of the overall class of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "we ran n - body simulations of dissipationless galaxy merging , exploring both major and minor mergers . in the case of major mergers",
    "we simulate two colliding systems , which are equal - mass , identical galaxy models with stellar and dm components , and no gas . in major - merger hierarchies , galaxies grow in mass by subsequent binary equal - mass mergers , up to an increase in stellar mass of a factor of @xmath31 . in the first step of a hierarchy the seed galaxies are spherically symmetric and non - rotating . in the second step of a hierarchy the end - product of the first step",
    "is replicated , and two such galaxies encounter one another . at this stage ,",
    "the systems are no longer spherically symmetric , thus each of them is initially randomly rotated around its center of mass .",
    "the setup of the initial conditions of the third step are obtained in the same way , starting from the remnant of the second step .    in the case of minor mergers ,",
    "we simulate the accretion of several smaller satellites onto a more massive system ( the mass ratio between each satellite and the massive galaxy is either @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "for a galaxy to grow significantly on reasonably short timescales through minor mergers , more than one satellite is expected to interact with the galaxy at the same time .",
    "for this reason , we considered hierarchies of minor mergers in which each step is represented by a multiple merger , so the initial conditions represent a massive galaxy surrounded by five or ten infalling satellites .",
    "each galaxy collision is followed up to the virialization of the resulting stellar system .",
    "a fraction of the particles is unbound at the end of the simulation : we define the merging end - product as the system composed by the bound stellar and dm particles . we note that in the case of minor - merger hierarchies not all the satellites present in the initial conditions must necessarily merge with the central galaxy . in some cases one or two of the satellites are found on an unbound orbit when all the other systems have already merged and the merger remnant relaxed .",
    "when this happens , the satellites are considered escaped and the merging is thus characterized by a significant stellar and dm mass loss .",
    "altogether we simulated 12 merging hierarchies : 6 major - merger hierarchies of 3 steps each , 2 major - merger hierarchies of 2 steps each , and 4 minor - merger hierarchies of 2 steps each .",
    "the seed galaxy models are spherically symmetric equilibrium two - component systems , with stellar and dm components . the stellar density distribution of the seed galaxies is represented by a @xmath34 model @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total stellar mass .",

    "what we refer to as model a ( see table  [ tab : mod ] ) , we assume @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , so that the resulting total mass profile is close to isothermal ( @xmath0 ) in the radial range @xmath76 ( see thin solid curve in fig .  [",

    "this is comparable with the observationally determined values @xmath161 and standard deviation @xmath162 @xcite , suggesting that if a population of early - type galaxies has initially close - to - isothermal total density profile , dry merging tends to maintain this property , but adds non - negligible scatter .",
    "the best - fitting values of @xmath157 for the single simulations are reported in table  [ tab : sim ] together with the other simulation parameters : off - axis major mergers tend to produce steeper density profiles than head - on encounters , while there is no evidence of a dependence of @xmath157 on the orbital energy .",
    "minor and major merging involving more dm dominated galaxies ( model d ) tend to decrease @xmath157 .",
    "we focused on the slope of the total density profile over the radial range @xmath154 , which is approximately the range probed in combined strong - lensing and stellar kinematics observations .",

    "taken by itself this effect might be interpreted as quite naturally explaining the `` tilt '' seen in the luminosity - based fp relation in terms of a systematic increase in the central dm fraction with increasing mass .",

    "however , the increase of @xmath167 with mass during the merging hierarchy is mainly driven by a strong increase in the effective radius produced by dry merging , which might be considered an argument against the relevance of dry mergers in the assembly of elliptical galaxies ( see   [ sec : lens ] ) .",
    "in fact , the trend is quite different if one considers @xmath166 as measured within a small aperture of fixed radius , independent of the galaxy s half - light radius .",

    "@xcite pointed out that , when comparing merging simulations with the standard ( luminosity based ) scaling relations of early - type galaxies , it is crucial to consider not only the edge - on fp , but also the faber - jackson and the kormendy relation , because a system may well lie on the fp while deviating significantly from the other relations .",
    "similarly , the fact that a galaxy model lies on the mp does not mean that it satisfies also the the observed lensing mass - size and mass - velocity dispersion relations , because for fixed @xmath22 anomalous values of both @xmath4 and @xmath3 can conspire to give a value of @xmath25 perfectly consistent with observations .",
    "for this reason we will study how our merger hierarchies behave with respect to all three lensing scaling laws .      as discussed extensively in @xcite , for a spherical galaxy model the dimensionless quantity @xmath25",

    "given that the mp relation has no tilt and that the observed mass - size and mass - velocity dispersion relations are consistent with power laws over the range covered by the lensing data ( equations  [ [ eq : mp ] ] , [ [ eq : reff ] ] and [ [ eq : sigma ] ] ) , we would not need to specify the mass of the seed galaxy in order to address the question of the effect of dry merging .",

    "the implications of the observed value of @xmath25 for galaxy _ structure _ ( as opposed to evolution ) are the subject of @xcite .",

    "the growth of galaxies by dry merging of smaller systems can be quantified by approximating the dependence of the structural parameters on mass with power - law functions : @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "for each step of a hierarchy the power - law indices are given by @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , where @xmath191 indicates variation between the remnant and the progenitor [ e.g. @xmath192 .",
    "we can obtain an estimate of the expected global effect of a general dry - merging hierarchy by considering the average values ( @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) and the associated standard deviations ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 ) of these values for our major and minor merging hierarchies ( 30 steps altogether ) .",
    "these values must be compared with the slope of the observed scaling laws ( equations  [ [ eqobsrange ] ] , [ [ eq : reff ] ] and [ [ eq : sigma ] ] ) , which correspond to @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 , consistent with our statement that the mp is roughly preserved by dry mergers , but the mass  size and mass  velocity - dispersion relations are not .    remarkably , the distributions of @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 for our n - body experiments are characterized by a substantial scatter , which is quantified by the quoted values of the standard deviations .",
    "such a broad distribution around the average slope is an additional problem for the dry - merging scenario , because it implies that dry mergers bf would introduce a lot of dispersion in the scaling relations . to quantify this ,",
    "let us consider a population of galaxies , all with @xmath205 and @xmath206 , that evolve through dry merging with an unspecified merging history made of both minor and major mergers ( we are not assuming that these seed galaxies merge just among themselves ) : under the hypothesis that @xmath202 is distributed normally , the merger remnants of mass @xmath207 are expected to have @xmath208 normally distributed with average @xmath209 and standard deviation @xmath210 .",
    "thus , in this simple example , the predicted scatter in the @xmath182 relation at a given @xmath22 increases for increasing @xmath211 , and for fixed @xmath211 increases for increasing @xmath22 , suggesting that a large enough mass growth by dry merging would produce a spread in @xmath3 at given @xmath22 inconsistent with the tight observed correlation .",

    "summarizing , we showed that the lensing mass  size and mass  velocity - dispersion relations are effectively destroyed by dry mergers , which produce systems with too large half - light radii and too low velocity dispersions , and introduce substantial scatter in @xmath3 and @xmath4 at given mass .",
    "we conclude that _ present - day early - type galaxies did not form by dry merging of high-@xmath215 early - type galaxies obeying the local ( @xmath216 ) lensing scaling relations_.",
    "in the previous section we explored the effect of dry mergers on galaxies lying on the lensing scaling relations observed locally .",
    "however , higher-@xmath215 early - type galaxies must not necessarily obey the @xmath216 lensing scaling laws .",
    "in fact , though the lensing scaling relations at higher redshift are not available , measures of the effective radii and the stellar masses of high - redshift ( @xmath217 ) early - type galaxies suggest that these objects may be remarkably more compact than their local counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is useful to consider the following question : under the hypothesis that local early - type galaxies ( satisfying the lensing scaling laws ) formed by dry merging , what are the expected properties of their ( high - redshift ) progenitors ? to address this question we assume that the remnants of the last steps of all our simulated merging hierarchies satisfy the local @xmath182 relation .",

    "we recall that the candidate progenitors have values of @xmath25 consistent with those observed in present - day galaxies , because our seed galaxies lie on the mp by construction . though one can not assume a priori that high - z progenitors lie on the mp , this assumption is justified as far as we are assuming as working hypothesis that local early - type galaxies formed by dry merging , because we have shown that dry mergers tend to preserve the mp .",
    "the average properties of the candidate progenitors are qualitatively consistent with those of @xmath226 early - type galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , our results indicate that present - day , massive early - type galaxies did not assembled more than @xmath235 of their total ( dark plus luminous ) mass through dry merging .",
    "one important caveat is that the allowed amount of mass growth depends on @xmath236 and @xmath211 , and thus on the considered merging histories .",

    "move galaxies away from the observed correlations between total ( lensing ) mass and size or velocity dispersion .",
    "specifically , dry mergers increase the radius more rapidly than the scaling relation with mass would predict , while they do not increase velocity dispersion rapidly enough .",
    "4 .   add substantial scatter in the lensing mass - size and mass  velocity - dispersion relations .",
    "the first two findings indicate that two important properties of early - type galaxies the isothermal total mass profile and the mp are quite robust against dry merging . if these regular structural and kinematic properties are established presumably at @xmath242 , in order to satisfy constraints on the old age of their stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and of the lack of evolution of the logarithmic slope of the total mass density profile @xcite further growth via dry merging would not spoil this structural and kinematic homology of early - type galaxies .",
    "the third and fourth findings pose a significant problem for a scenario where early - type galaxies grow significantly in mass via dry mergers .",
    "the non - conservation of the mass  size and mass  velocity - dispersion relation shows that the progenitors of present day early - type galaxies can not be obeying the same scaling relations . on average , they will have to be smaller in size for a given velocity dispersion or total mass , qualitatively in line with some recent observational results @xcite .",
    "however , and most importantly , dry mergers add substantial scatter to the scaling relations .",
    "a few random generations of dry mergers would be sufficient to produce a scatter much larger than observed .",
    "in particular , our results exclude that present - day massive early - type galaxies assembled more than @xmath7 of their total ( luminous plus dark ) mass and increased their size by more than a factor @xmath243 via dry merging .",
    "quantitatively , the amount of dispersion introduced in the scaling laws by dry merging depends on the detailed properties of the merging history , such as dm content of the progenitors and mass - ratio and orbital parameters of the galaxy encounters . a high degree of fine tuning - where the properties of the progenitor correlate with the peculiarities of the mergers process  would be needed to reconcile dry mergers with the tight observed lensing scaling relations .    in the present work we considered only gas - free mergers ,",
    "so our results do not apply if mergers occur in the presence of significant amounts of gas .",
    "it is well known that dissipative processes might help reconcile merging with the standard scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is reasonable that the same can happen for the lensing scaling relations .",
    "however , the role of wet ( gas - rich ) mergers in the formation of early - type galaxies , though not strongly constrained by the scaling relations , is limited by other considerations : if these systems experienced a significant amount of mergers in relatively recent times , most of these mergers must have been dry , because the old stellar populations of early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are inconsistent with substantial recent star formation .",
    "it is also the case that in very massive galaxies most accreted cold gas is likely to be eliminated by evaporation from the hot interstellar medium before it can form stars @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our constraints on the dry - merging history apply to massive early - type galaxies , of which the slacs sample is representative , and are not in conflict with the hypothesis that exceptionally luminous , brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) formed via multiple dissipationless mergers , the so - called galactic cannibalism scenario @xcite .",

    "<S> dissipationless ( gas - free or `` dry '' ) mergers have been suggested to play a major role in the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies , particularly in growing their mass and size without altering their stellar populations . we perform a new test of the dry merger hypothesis by comparing n - body simulations of realistic systems to empirical constraints provided by recent studies of lens early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that major and minor dry mergers : i ) preserve the nearly isothermal structure ( @xmath0 ) of early - type galaxies within the observed scatter ; ii ) do not change more than the observed scatter the ratio between total mass @xmath1 and `` virial '' mass @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the half - light radius and @xmath4 the projected velocity dispersion ) ; iii ) increase strongly galaxy sizes ( @xmath5 ) and weakly velocity dispersions ( @xmath6 ) with mass , thus moving galaxies away from the local observed @xmath1-@xmath3 and @xmath1-@xmath4 relations ; iv ) introduce substantial scatter in the @xmath1-@xmath3 and @xmath1-@xmath4 relations . </S>",
    "<S> our findings imply that unless there is a high degree of fine tuning of the mix of progenitors and types of interactions present - day massive early - type galaxies can not have assembled more than @xmath7 of their mass , and increased their size by more than a factor @xmath8 , via dry merging . </S>"
