    "mira variables are believed to be in the last stage of asymptotic giant branch ( hereafter agb ) evolution .",
    "they have larger amplitudes ( e.g. @xmath4  mag in @xmath5-band ) than other red variables , i.e. semi - regular variables or irregular variables . as a result of the short lifetimes of mira variables",
    ", one needs a rather large population of stars to find a sufficient number of mira variables to perform a statistical study on them .",
    "this means that a large area should be observed repeatedly for a long enough duration to cover several pulsational periods , usually a hard task to do .",
    "however , the situation has been changed in the last decade by the gravitational microlensing search projects : optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ; udalski , kubiak & szymanski , 1997 ) , massive compact halo objects project ( macho ; @xcite ) , microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ; @xcite ) , and so on .",
    "researchers investigating variable stars are now enjoying the wealth of the data provided by these projects .",
    "the region studied most extensively is apparently the large magellanic cloud : the discovery of five parallel sequences in the @xmath2-@xmath3 diagram by @xcite was followed by many papers ( noda et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; kiss & bedding , 2003 , 2004 ; @xcite ; ita et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b ; @xcite ) . following the conclusion of @xcite and @xcite that the scatter around period - magnitude relation of mira variables is small for bolometric or near - infrared magnitudes , papers focused on infrared properties of mira variables and those of other kinds of red variables .",
    "however , the galactic bulge region has not received full attention except for the baade windows ( @xcite ; glass and schultheis 2002 , 2003 ; schultheis , glass & cioni , 2004 ) .",
    "wray , eyer & paczyski ( 2004 ) analyzed ogle variables over larger area of the bulge , but they only discussed small - amplitude variables and not mira variables .",
    "woniak , mccowan & vestrand ( 2004 ) also made a detailed analysis of microvariability of mira variables in the ogle data , but no effort was dedicated to searching for infrared counterparts , which is indispensable to study the period - magnitude relation .    in this paper , we collected mira variables in the ogle data and obtained their counterparts in the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalogue @xcite and the _ midcourse space experiment ( msx ) _ point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "after we present data analyses to obtain a catalogue in section [ sec : data ] , we discuss their photometric properties ( section [ sec : discuss1 ] ) and their space distribution in the bulge ( section [ sec : discuss2 ] ) .",

    "the majority of identified objects have a quality flag @xmath14 ( excellent ) and all have flags better than @xmath15 ( fair / poor ) in the @xmath13-band , while more than two thirds of objects have a flag of @xmath16 ( limit ) or @xmath17 ( not detected ) in other bands .",
    "therefore , we decided to use only the @xmath13-band flux in our discussions .",
    "the @xmath13-band magnitudes ( denoted as [ 8 ] ) were obtained using the zero magnitude flux of 58.49  jy @xcite .",
    "names and [ 8 ] magnitudes for identified sources are listed in table [ tab : mira ] .",
    "the 427 objects without the _ msx _ counterpart have relatively short periods ( @xmath18 days ) and blue colours [ @xmath19 ] , i.e. fainter @xmath3 magnitudes according to the period-@xmath3 relation and little excesses in mid infrared .",
    "they are naturally expected to be faint in the @xmath13-band .    ]       by @xcite and @xmath11 by us.[fig : excess ] ]    the ogle - ii fields were chosen in the relatively low extinction regions in the galactic bulge . still they are located at low galactic latitudes where the interstellar extinction is generally strong . in order to estimate the extinction for each ogle - ii field , we measured how much the red giant branch shifts along a reddening vector in the colour - magnitude diagram . comparing the position of the branch for each field with that for the baade window ngc  6522 field , the positional difference was interpreted as being the result of the extinction difference between the two fields .",
    "the extinction value for the ngc  6522 field itself was taken as @xmath20 from @xcite .",
    "the procedures were adopted on both the @xmath21 versus @xmath3 diagram and the @xmath22 versus @xmath3 diagram .",
    "slopes of the reddening vectors were taken from @xcite : @xmath23 the extinction values obtained from both diagrams agree very well within @xmath24 mag for every field .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : fields ] .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : excess ] , our results are consistent with the @xmath25 values for ogle - ii fields obtained by @xcite .",
    "although a metallicity gradient within the bulge can cause shifts on our estimates due to the dependence of the colour of giant branch , such a gradient was not detected and is considered to be small ( @xcite ; frogel , tiede , & kuchinski , 1999 ; @xcite ) . a difference of 0.2 dex in [ fe / h ] results in a shift of 0.03 mag in @xmath11 .",
    "no reddening correction was applied to mid - infrared data since they are small and uncertain .",
    "the saturation limit of ogle - ii observation is about @xmath26 . as a result ,",
    "the extinction - corrected @xmath27 magnitudes are limited to @xmath28 in fig .",

    "their distribution shows a similar decrease toward brighter region ( @xmath30 ) as is shown by our histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : maghist ] .",
    "furthermore , kinematic studies showed these bright mira variables to have a small velocity dispersion , and they are probably foreground objects in the outer bulge or disc ( @xcite ; sharples , walker & cropper , 1990 ) . on the other extreme , no variables fainter than @xmath31 were detected .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ifig ] , the fainter boundary for the short - period mira variables is clearly delineated , but the long - period mira variables seem to extend to below the detection limit . while the reddest sources in our sample show @xmath32 2 , some oh / ir stars near the galactic centre have as large @xmath33 as 3  mag ( wood , habing & mcgregor , 1998 ) .",
    "such red objects have also been found among the _ iras _ sources in the galactic bulge between @xmath34 ( whitelock , feast & catchpole , 1991 ) .",
    "these extremely red objects are undergoing heavy mass loss which leads to large @xmath33 .",

    "they assigned those red objects to carbon - rich ( c - rich ) stars which are absent in the galactic bulge .",
    "[ fig:2d ] shows the colour - magnitude and the colour - colour diagrams of the mira variables in the ogle - ii fields .",

    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : hkhist ] shows the fraction of such red variables is so small that the difference is not significant .",
    "[ fig : hkhist ] also presents the colour distribution of mira variables in both mcs , the data for which were collected from @xcite using the same criteria , i.e. ( [ eq : conp])([eq : cona ] ) . as @xcite mentioned , the distribution is clearly different among three galaxies .",
    "this is caused by the different combinations of oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) stars and c - rich stars , as is discussed in the following .",
    "[ fig : colamp ] shows the relationship between the colour @xmath33 and the amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite argued that the dichotomy for the lmc is caused by the difference between o - rich stars ( bluer ) and c - rich ones ( redder ) .",
    "a distinction between o- and c - rich stars is not apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : hkhist ] , but is clearly seen in fig . [",
    "fig : colamp ] as two separate branches .",
    "while the distribution of o - rich mira variables forms a rather sharp ridge at @xmath41 for the lmc , the ridge is wider and stretches to a redder colour for the bulge .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the giant branch star with the higher metal content has the redder colour as shown for galactic globular clusters ( frogel , cohen & persson , 1983 ; @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the peak disappears for the smc .",
    "this is probably because the lower metal content for the smc reduces the fraction of o - rich stars .",
    "the dichotomy in fig .",
    "[ fig : colamp ] for the lmc disappears for the bulge .",
    "the o - rich branch dominates , and the redder part looks extended from the branch .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that so far no bright carbon star at the tip of the agb has been found within the galactic bulge @xcite .",

    "the solid line is a @xmath2-@xmath3 relation of the lmc mira variables ( @xcite ) after the correction of difference in the distance modulus .",
    "crosses representing mira variables with @xmath50 occupy a fainter region because of the circumstellar extinction in the @xmath3-band .",

    "the circumstellar extinction is responsible for this @xmath3-band darkening because the reddened variables have longer periods as those in the bulge do ( see fig . [",
    "fig : plcpla ] ) .",
    "the distribution for the bulge seems different from those for the mcs and the deviations seem to occur even for bluer mira variables .",
    "the distribution for the bulge has a large spread compared with the mcs .",
    "this is caused by the depth of the bulge along the line of sight . as stars in the bulge",
    "have a rather wide range of metallicities ( @xcite , and references therein ) , there could also be an effect from some kinds of metallicity dependence . although @xcite claimed they found the metallicity dependence of the zero point between both mcs , it is still a subject of controversy ( see @xcite , for a review ) .",

    "[ fig : colplr ] are least - square fitted lines for mira variables with @xmath48 after one 2-@xmath52 clipping .",
    "it is interesting that their slopes are similar to the reddening coefficient @xmath53 ( @xmath54 for the bulge ; @xmath55 for the lmc ; @xmath56 for the smc ) .",

    "we also confirmed this feature in the distribution of red clump stars ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fld ] ) using the result obtained by @xcite .",
    "this is because the surface brightness of the bulge is a so - called boxy-type and the brightness does not vary along @xmath62 between the region ( see , for example , fig . 1 by @xcite ) .",

    "first , we need to know the interstellar extinction . between the @xmath11",

    "[ fig : akejk ] . from this equation",
    ", we obtained @xmath64 as the intrinsic colour of the bulge population .",
    "it is a reasonable colour for old and metal - rich stellar population .",
    "for example , a recent population synthesis model by @xcite predicts a stellar population with @xmath65 ( or [ m / h]@xmath66 ) would have such a colour over a wide range of ages between 16  gyr and 2  gyr .",
    "we regard the above equation as being applicable to areas other than those observed by the ogle - ii survey , and used this relation to estimate the interstellar extinction .",
    "after the correction of the interstellar extinction , we subtracted the disc contribution .",
    "the disc is described in an exponential form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the scale - hight for each galactic latitude , fitting to the observed surface brightness between @xmath69 . with the obtained disc components subtracted ,",
    "the surface brightness of the bulge component for each field is obtained by averaging the values within @xmath70 from the central coordinate of the field .",
    "[ fig : cobe ] shows the relationship between the thus - obtained surface brightness and the number of mira variables for each field .",
    "the specific frequency of mira variables per unit apparent brightness is 0.059 jy@xmath71 from the slope of the figure . assuming a distance of 8  kpc for the bulge , the frequency per unit @xmath3-band absolute brightness is 0.094 mjy@xmath71 . for metal - rich globular clusters ,",
    "@xcite determined the specific frequency of long - period variables to be 0.11 mjy@xmath71 ( see their eq .",
    "2 ) . considering that they did nt include variables with @xmath72 , whereas they account for about 10 per cent of our sample , the frequency for the bulge is 25 per cent smaller than that for the globular clusters .",
    "this can be because the high metal content in the bulge enhances the mass loss and abbreviates the lifetimes of mira variables as @xcite suggested .",

    "furthermore , lah , kiss & bedding ( 2005 ) explored the three - dimensional structures of the mcs .",
    "we expect that the structure of the bulge can also be traced by mira variables .",
    "it is considered to be shaped like a bar inclined from the sun - galactic centre line of sight by 15 - 40@xmath76 after many works with various methods ( distribution of luminous late - type stars , @xcite ; gas dynamics , @xcite ; @xcite ; surface brightness distribution , @xcite ; @xcite ; distribution and kinematics of sio masers , @xcite ; peak of luminosity function due to red clump stars , @xcite ; @xcite ) . using 104 mira variables , @xcite also showed the asymmetry of the bulge .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar ] , the distribution of ogle - ii mira variables are projected on the galactic plane .",
    "distances to individual variables are obtained by adopting the relation ( [ eq : plr ] ) .",
    "as the very red objects tend to deviate from this relation , we used only stars with @xmath77 to avoid the circumstellar extinction .",
    "unfortunately , we had to use single - epoch magnitudes from the 2mass catalogue , instead of average magnitudes which are usually used for the distance estimation .",
    "the uncertainty in our estimate from single - epoch magnitudes causes the distance uncertainty to rise by up to @xmath78  kpc in the extreme case .",
    "still we notice that there are far less stars at nearer region to the sun on the negative longitude side than on the positive side .",
    "this asymmetry should reflect the elongated shape of the bulge .",
    "it is expected that more dense surveys , i.e. toward a number of galactic longitudes , will reveal the detailed structure of the bulge .",

    "<S> we have extracted a total of 1968 mira variables from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ii ( ogle - ii ) data base in the galactic bulge region . among them , 1960 are associated with 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) sources , and 1541 are further identified with _ midcourse space exploration ( msx ) _ point sources . </S>",
    "<S> their photometric properties are compared with those of mira variables in the large and small magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that mass - losing stars with circumstellar matter are reddened such that the colour dependence of the absorption coefficient is similar to that of interstellar matter . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the structure of the bulge . </S>",
    "<S> the surface number density of the bulge mira variables is well correlated with the 2.2-@xmath0 m surface brightness obtained by the _ cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) _ satellite . using this relation , </S>",
    "<S> the total number of mira variables in the bulge is estimated to be about 6 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation of the mira variables gives their space distribution which supports the well - known asymmetry of the bar - like bulge .    </S>",
