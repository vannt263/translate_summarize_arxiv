    "the main challenge for existing and planned underwater / ice neutrino telescopes @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite is detection of neutrino of extraterrestrial origin .",
    "but neutrino is neutral weakly interacting particle and one can not observe it directly but has to detect it by means of lepton that appears in @xmath0 interaction and passes a distance in medium before being detected .",
    "the case with @xmath1 is considered , first of all , because muons possess the best ability to propagate large distances in contrast to @xmath2 ( due to their short radiation length ) and @xmath3 ( due to their short life time ) in a wide range of energies . on the other hand , atmospheric muons",
    "( that represent a penetrating component of atmospheric showers resulting from interaction of primary cosmic radiation with the earth atmosphere ) are the principal background for neutrino signal . to eliminate it one has to predict correctly the detector response on atmospheric muon flux .",
    "also one should keep in mind the fact that atmospheric muons are of scientific interest themselves : for instance , from the point of view of charm production @xcite . the last ( but not the least ) important",
    "point is detector calibration which has to be done , again by means of atmospheric muons that are the only more or less known intensive calibration source for deep underwater / ice neutrino telescopes .",
    "thus , when analyzing experimental data obtained with underwater / ice detectors one has to apply some model for muon transport through thick layers of matter , using an algorithm that gives the muon energy @xmath4 at the end of distance @xmath5 providing that its initial energy is equal to @xmath6 .",
    "commonly , monte carlo ( mc ) technique is used for this purpose @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite being the most adequate to essentially stochastic nature of muon energy losses .",
    "such a mc algorithm necessarily incorporates some uncertainties into the final result .",
    "these uncertainties can be divided into two parts :    * insurmountable uncertainties which relates to * * finite accuracy of formulae for muon cross - sections ; * * data on medium density and composition .",
    "* `` inner '' errors that are produced by simulation algorithm itself due to * * finite accuracy of numerical procedures ; * * simplifications that are done to get reasonable computation time .     as a function of @xmath7 as measured and parametrized by zeus collaboration ( markers and dashed line , correspondingly ) , and parametrized by bezrukov - bugaev ( solid line ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ fig : sigma_exp ]     ( solid line ) and ( b ) zeus parameterization ( dashed line )",
    ". , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ fig : enlopn ]    in case @xmath8 an algorithm is obviously too inaccurate and corrupts result more than uncertainties with the muon cross - sections and medium composition .",
    "@xmath9 is better but leads to unreasonable wasting of human and computer efforts , the tool for the muon transport is too `` thin '' comparing to insurmountable uncertainties of group @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the case @xmath11 seems to be an optimum equilibrium .",
    "this report is aimed to get some quantitative parameters of muon transport algorithm which condition @xmath11 leads to .",
    "the accuracy of existing formulae for muon cross - sections was analyzed in number of works @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that it is not higher than @xmath121% for @xmath13 1 tev and becomes the worse the higher muon energy is .",
    "we do not give here the complete analysis but consider only two examples that concern the muon photonuclear interaction which contributes the largest uncertainty to the total muon energy losses comparing with other kinds of muon interactions that represent purely electromagnetic ( and hence , better known ) processes : ionization , bremsstrahlung , and direct @xmath14-pair production .",
    "for last twenty years one has been using the formula for photonuclear muon cross - section that was developed in the frame of generalized vector dominance model ( gvdm ) @xcite .",
    "in such an approach the differential cross - section ( and , consequently , the muon energy losses due to photonuclear interactions ) is proportional to the total cross - section for absorption of a real photon by a nucleon , @xmath15 .",
    "there are several parameterizations for @xmath15 that were obtained by trying to get the best fit to experimental data @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "two of them are shown in fig.1 along with the last results from the zeus experiment @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 is presented as a function of @xmath7 , where @xmath16 is the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath17 system .",
    "parameterizations @xcite ( bb ) and @xcite ( zeus ) both fit more or less the experimental data but even within `` experimentally known '' range @xmath18 10@xmath19 gev@xmath20 the difference between two parameterizations reaches 4% . at @xmath21",
    "= 10@xmath22 gev@xmath20 the bb curve is higher than the zeus one by 15% .",
    "the same data are presented in fig.2 in terms of muon energy losses due to photonuclear interaction in pure water .",
    "difference is kept within several percents below @xmath23 100 tev and then grows up to @xmath12 10% at @xmath24 = 1 eev .",
    "parameterizations for @xmath15 published in @xcite,@xcite are lower comparing to zeus parameterization since they are based on old results which differ remarkably from the latest zeus data . on the other hand , the recent parameterization @xcite is higher comparing to bb .",
    "-pair production @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ( dotted lines ) are shown , as well .",
    "solid lines stand for total energy loss ( brem + pair + nuc , ionization not included ) with- @xcite,@xcite and without @xcite accounting for qcd part in photonuclear interaction .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ fig : qcd ]    it became clear in last few years that at very high lepton energies the essential part of photonuclear cross - section is due to nongvdm contribution . it appears , that this additional part is well described by qcd perturbation theory .",
    "recent new calculations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite show an essential increase of the muon energy losses due to photonuclear interactions . in @xcite the allm formulae @xcite ( that is based on regge approach and on h1 and zeus data )",
    "is used for parameterization of nucleon structure function @xmath25 . in @xcite",
    "the ckmt regge model @xcite is applied for a description of @xmath25 at low and intermediate @xmath26 ( squared four - momentum transfer ) and the fit of parton distribution functions given by mrs group @xcite at high @xmath26 .",
    "authors of @xcite use for calculation of qcd perturbative part the color dipole model in version of @xcite , with parameters founded from latest desy data .",
    ".differences in terms of the muon energy losses in standard rock due to photonuclear interaction ( in percents ) between three works that account for qcd part @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and bezrukov - bugaev formula based on gvdm @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of these three works are presented in fig.3 and tables 1,2 in terms of the muon energy losses in standard rock . @xcite and @xcite are close to each other while the muon energy losses obtained in @xcite are essentially lower .",
    "we believe that this is due to the fact that old data @xcite were used in @xcite to fit the parameters of model .",
    "anyway , the total muon energy losses become higher when accounting for perturbative qcd part in photonuclear interactions by 1@xmath272% at @xmath24 = 100 tev and by 20@xmath2730% at @xmath24 = 1 eev  -leptons as photonuclear interaction dominates in @xmath28 s energy losses at @xmath29 100 tev ] .",
    "fig.4 shows changes in muon survival probabilities in sea water and standard rock which incorporation of nongvdm qcd - corrections results in   and @xmath28-lepton transport @xcite that is available by request to authors . ] .",
    "it is seen that for extremely high energies ( @xmath30 1 pev ) effect is very significant .",
    "[ fig : tau2 ]    energy losses are proportional , in particular , to medium density .",
    "the density of water ( ice ) is known or , in any case , can be measured precisely .",
    "but since the main technique to select the neutrino induced events is looking for up - going muons from the lower hemisphere , one should know also the density and composition of sea bed rock .",
    "when this is unknown one has to use a standard rock model ( @xmath31 = 2.65 g/@xmath32 , @xmath33 = 22 , and @xmath34 = 11 ) . at the same time the measured rock densities at gran sasso and frejus underground laboratories",
    "are equal , for instance , to @xmath35 = 2.70 g/@xmath32 and @xmath36 = 2.74 g/@xmath32 , respectively @xcite,@xcite which is 2@xmath273% higher .",
    "investigation of the baikal lake bed ( nt-200 neutrino telescope ) showed a complex structure with several layers of different composition and density that varies with increase the depth from @xmath37 = 1.70 g/@xmath32 to @xmath37 = 2.90 g/@xmath32 ( @xmath3825% variations ) @xcite .",
    "thus , error that is incorporated to muon transport calculations by uncertainties with the rock density / composition lies , at least , at a few percents level .    all this have led us to a conclusion that we never know the muon energy losses better than with 1%-accuracy ( actually , worse ) and , consequently it makes no sense to waste efforts trying to reproduce energy losses with accuracy better than 10@xmath39 with an algorithm for the muon transport .",
    "so , there is a reasonable quantitative criterium for a muon propagation algorithm goodness : algorithm whose accuracy is better than 1% can be accepted as a good one , otherwise it is bad .",
    "among all simplifications that may be done when developing an algorithm for the muon propagation ( and that affect the algorithm accuracy ) one is obligatory .",
    "as number of muon interactions per unit of path is practically infinite it is impossible to simulate all acts and one has to set some threshold for relative energy transfer @xmath40 ( @xmath41 = @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is energy which is passed by muon of energy @xmath24 to either real or virtual photon in a single interaction ) above which muon energy losses are treated by the direct simulation of @xmath44 for each interaction ( `` stochastic '' part ) and below which energy losses are treated by means of stopping - power formula ( `` soft '' part ) that can be obtained by integration of differential cross - sections for the muon interactions : @xmath45     vs @xmath40 obtained as a result of mc simulation for monoenergetic muon beams with initial energies @xmath46 = 1 tev ( 1st column of plots ) , 10 tev ( 2nd column ) , 100 tev ( 3rd column ) and 10 pev ( 4th column ) .",
    "each column contains six plots which correspond to six depths @xmath5 .",
    "see text for more details .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=328 ] [ fig : fig1 ]    ( @xmath33 is a mass number of the target nucleus , @xmath47 is the avogadro number ) .",
    "number of interactions to be simulated per unit of muon path depends on @xmath40 , growing roughly as @xmath48 along with computation time .",
    "so , it would be desirable to choose @xmath40 as large as possible .",
    "but , on the other hand , increase of @xmath40 affects the simulation accuracy since some part of statistical fluctuations in energy losses goes out of simulation and is not accounted for .",
    "thus , the question is _ how large value of @xmath40 may be chosen to keep result within 1%-accuracy _ ?",
    "this problem was discussed in literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite but , in our opinion , more careful analysis is lacking .",
    "let s firstly consider propagation of monoenergetic muon beams .",
    "fig.5 shows results on propagation ( survival probabilities @xmath49 vs @xmath40 ) for four beams with initial energies 1 tev , 10 tev , 100 tev and 10 pev through slant depths 3.2 km , 12 km , 23 km and 40 km , respectively , in pure water .",
    "closed circles represent results obtained with knock - on electrons ( that appear as a result of ionization with large energy transferred to an atomic electron ) included in direct simulation , open circles stand for completely continuous ionization that is treated simply by bethe - bloch formula .",
    "solid lines on each panel correspond to @xmath40 = 10@xmath50 and all energy losses multiplied by factors 0.99 ( upper line ) and 1.01 ( lower line ) , thus these lines limit `` @xmath381%-energy - losses - error - band '' .",
    "horizontal dotted lines correspond to @xmath40 = 10@xmath50 and cross section for absorption of a real photon by a nucleon parametrized according to @xcite instead of parameterization @xcite that was mainly applied at presented simulations .",
    "one can conclude as follows :    * in most cases with except for lower row and the left column ( that corresponds to low survival probabilities and low muon initial energies , respectively ) survival probabilities lie mainly within @xmath381%-band .",
    "* the difference between survival probabilities for two models of ionization - partially fluctuating ( above @xmath40 ) and completely `` soft '' - is the less appreciable the larger muon energy is .",
    "* parameterizations @xcite and @xcite do not differ noticeable from each other in terms of survival probabilities . * for @xmath51 0.02@xmath270.05 there is almost no dependence of survival probability on @xmath40 with except for very last part of muon path where survival probability becomes small .",
    "now let s go to the more realistic case with atmospheric muons .",
    "fig.6 represents intensities of vertical atmospheric muon flux at 8 depths @xmath5 of pure water as functions of @xmath40 as obtained by simulation with muons sampled according to sea level spectrum @xcite : @xmath52 meaning of closed and open circles , as well as solid and dotted lines is the same as for fig.5 .",
    "dashed lines on panels for @xmath53 5 km correspond to intensities which were computed for all energy losses treated as completely `` continuous '' ( no fluctuations included ) .",
    "dash - dotted lines show intensities of vertical muon flux simulated with muons sampled according to the gaisser sea level spectrum @xcite : @xmath54     as obtained by mc simulation .",
    "see text for more details .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=328 ] [ fig : fig2 ]    general conclusions are qualitatively the same as for mono - energetic muon beams but quantitatively the influence of @xmath40 and model of ionization is much weaker",
    ". one can conclude the following :    * computed muon flux is strongly affected by accounting for fluctuations in energy losses : muon flux intensity computed by means of stopping - power formula is less comparing with mc simulated flux by @xmath1210 % at 3 km and by @xmath12 20% at 5 km . at the depth of 20 km muon flux computed with ignorance of fluctuations is only 10 % of simulated flux . *",
    "1%-uncertainty in muon cross sections plays the principal role for resulting error ( all simulated data lie within @xmath381%-band with no exceptions ) .",
    "this error has a tendency to grow with depth from @xmath382.5% at 1 km to @xmath5515% at 20 km .",
    "* difference between muon spectra @xcite and @xcite leads to uncertainty from at 1 km to + 16% at 20 km . * error which appears due to simplified , entirely `` continuous '' ionization lies , commonly , at the level of 2@xmath273% . *",
    "dependence of simulated muon flux intensity upon @xmath40 is the most weak one comparing with other error sources .",
    "thus , we can make the following conclusions : to reproduce muon energy losses with an accuracy better than 10@xmath39 it is quite enough to account only for fluctuations in energy losses with fraction of energy lost being as large as @xmath56 0.05@xmath270.1 ( commonly , values @xmath40",
    "= 10@xmath5710@xmath39 are incorporated in majority of algorithms for the muon propagation by now @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "at least , in case with atmospheric muons only radiative losses may be simulated while ionization may be treated as an entirely continuous process without any lost of accuracy . in spite of remarkable dependency of simulated survival probabilities upon accounting or not accounting for fluctuations in ionization ( see fig.5 )",
    "it seems to be correctly to treat ionization by completely continuous way also for neutrino - produced muons , as ( a ) differences in survival probabilities appear only for relatively low energies ; ( b ) they are of few percents only ; ( c ) they are of both signs and so , are expected to be partially self - compensated ; ( d ) the uncertainties with @xmath58 cross - sections are still much larger , in any case @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . with such parameters",

    "the energy range 25 gev@xmath271 pev is divided into two parts to keep linear scale : the upper plot stands for energy losses vs @xmath24 = 25 gev@xmath271 tev , the lower one does for energy losses divided by energy vs @xmath24 = 1 tev@xmath271 pev . the model for propmu energy losses",

    "title=\"fig:\",width=328 ] [ fig : water_add ]    we would like to emphasize that uncertainties with atmospheric muon flux intensity that are caused by only @xmath381% variations in energy losses are much higher than 1% ( see item ( b ) above ) .",
    "this is due to sharp power - law shape of surface atmospheric muon spectrum and due to the fact that source of atmospheric muons is far away from an underwater / ice detector and their flux may only decrease when passing from the sea level down to detector depth .",
    "the source of muons that are produced in @xmath59 interactions is uniformly distributed over water / ice and/or rock both out- and inside the array .",
    "so , uncertainties with energy losses should affect the results for neutrino - generated muons weaker .",
    "indeed , intensity of the muon flux which accompanies the neutrino flux in a medium is proportional to the muon range that , in turn , is inversely proportional to energy losses and , consequently , an error in energy losses leads to an equal error with an opposite sign in simulated flux of muons which are born in @xmath58-interactions .",
    "any muon mc propagation algorithm consists of a set of procedures on numerical solution of equations , interpolation and integration .",
    "all these procedures are of finite accuracy and , consequently , the incoming model for muon interactions is somewhat corrupted by them .",
    "having a set of formulae for the muon cross - sections for bremsstrahlung , @xmath14-pair production , photonuclear process , and knock - on electron production it is easy to obtain the formula for the total averaged muon energy losses by integration of differential cross - sections over all range of kinematically allowed @xmath41 : @xmath60    but energy losses as they are simulated by an algorithm will differ from ( 4 ) due to `` corrupting '' application of numerical procedures .",
    "two algorithms with the same formulae for cross - sections at the input will reproduce the muon energy losses differently .",
    "the difference between simulated and calculated energy losses collects all errors that are contributed by each step of algorithm and thus , is a good quantitative criterium for its _ inner accuracy _ , whose contribution to the resulting error must not exceed 1% , as it was shown in the sec .",

    "muons at the sea level were sampled according to the same spectrum @xcite . also parameterizations @xcite and @xcite are shown . simulations with music and mum give practically the same results because both codes reproduce almost the same energy losses ( see fig.7 ) .",

    "the reason is that it is based on very hard sea - level muon spectrum with index @xmath74  2.57 @xcite , while kbs parameterization adopts a spectrum with @xmath74  2.72 . as a result , there are less muons with relatively low energies ( which contribute the main bulk to the muon flux at low depths ) and more muons of high energies which contribute to the muon flux at larger depths . the reduced muon energy losses in propmu result in the depth muon spectra which ( a ) are significantly higher ( 31% , 30% , 27% and 17% in terms of integral muon flux at the depths @xmath62  1  km , 3  km , 6  km and 10  km , correspondingly ) and ( b ) are expanded to the low energies .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath62  1  km was simulated also with `` corrupted '' version of mum : all muon cross - sections along with bethe - bloch ionization formula were multiplied by a factor 0.9 , thus energy losses were reduced by 10% and became close to ones that are reproduced by propmu  1  tev at the sea level . for this range propmu",

    "the result is given on upper left panel of fig.10 by open circles ( mum@xmath63 ) .",
    "a good agreement between propmu and mum@xmath63 represents a good quantitative cross - check for results on propmu inner accuracy .",
    "the optimum value for inner accuracy of a mc code for the muon transport is close to 1% . in any case we never know the muon energy losses better .    to keep such inner accuracy it is quite enough to simulate the muon interactions with a fractions of energy lost that are as large as @xmath76 0.05@xmath270.1 , treating the rest of energy losses ( soft part ) by means of stopping - power formula .",
    "such a test has been applied to three muon transportation codes . according to `` 1% goodness criterium '' codes mum and",
    "music can be accepted as accurate enough .",
    "accuracy of the propmu algorithm is insufficient ( down to 25% ) and depends on medium , version of code and simulation parameters .",

    "<S> chain of calculations which have to be performed to predict any kind of signal in a deep underwater / ice neutrino detector necessarily includes the lepton propagation through thick layers of matter , as neutrino can be observed only by means of leptons ( muons , first of all , due to their large ranges ) that are generated in @xmath0 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the muon propagation plays a key role when analyzing data and it is important to understand clearly how transportation part of simulation chain contributes to total inaccuracy of final results . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider sources of uncertainties that appear in monte carlo algorithms for simulation of muon transport . </S>",
    "<S> the trivial but effective test is proposed to measure the propagation algorithm accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the test is applied to three mc muon transport codes ( propmu , music , mum ) and results are reported . </S>"
