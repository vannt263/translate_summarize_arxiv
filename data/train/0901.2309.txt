    "neutron stars are among the most mysterious objects in the universe .",
    "they are natural testing grounds of our knowledge about the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "the latter determines the structure and many properties of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "neutron stars are expected to have a solid inner crust which is believed to play an important role in understanding a number of astrophysical observations  @xcite , such as , pulsar glitches @xcite , quasi - periodic oscillations observed in x - ray emission following x - ray bursts on neutron star @xcite , the cooling observed over the first several years following superbursts from neutron stars or giant flares from magnetars @xcite , and neutrino opacities @xcite .",
    "the solid inner crust of a neutron star comprises the region between the density @xmath17 where neutrons drip out of nuclei and the density @xmath0 where the transition to the homogeneous nucleonic matter occurs . while the @xmath17 is relatively well determined to be @xmath18 g/@xmath19 @xcite , the transition density @xmath0 is still very uncertain @xcite .",
    "this is largely due to our poor knowledge about the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath3 at sub - saturation densities @xcite .",
    "consequently , our ability of understanding accurately many important properties of neutron stars has been hampered  @xcite .",
    "the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter also plays an important role in heavy - ion collisions especially those induced by neutron - rich radioactive beams in terrestrial laboratories . while heavy - ion collisions are not expected to create the same matter and conditions as in neutron stars , the same elementary nuclear interactions are at work in the two cases .",
    "thus , it is important to examine ramifications of conclusions regrading the eos extracted from one field in the other one .",
    "significant progress has been made recently in constraining the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter using heavy - ion experiments ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the most recent review ) .",
    "in particular , compared to the existing model predictions in the literature the analyses of isospin diffusion data  @xcite in heavy - ion collisions have constrained relatively tightly the @xmath3 in exactly the same sub - saturation density region around the expected inner edge of neutron star crust .",
    "moreover , conclusions from analyzing some recent data  @xcite of the isoscaling phenomenon  @xcite in heavy - ion collisions and the available data on the thickness of neutron - skin in @xmath20pb @xcite are consistent with the @xmath3 constrained by the isospin diffusion data .",
    "furthermore , the lower bound of the experimentally constrained @xmath3 is consistent with the relativistic mean field model prediction using the fsugold interaction that can reproduce not only saturation properties of nuclear matter but also structure properties and giant resonances of many finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "while some model dependence and uncertainties still exist in the analyses of the above mentioned experiments and calculations , an overlapping area of the extracted @xmath3 from several analyses has appeared in the sub - saturation density region  @xcite . on the other hand , extremely impressive progress has also been made in astrophysical observations relevant for constraining the eos of nuclear matter . to our best knowledge , nevertheless , mainly because of the low precision associated with the current measurements of neutron star radii , a non - controversial conclusion on the eos and the density dependence of symmetry energy has yet to come .",
    "more accurate observations of neutron stars properties , especially their radii , with advanced x - ray satellites and other observatories , will hopefully enable us to constrain stringently the eos of neutron - rich matter in the near future . a direct cross - check on the eos extracted independently from heavy - ion reactions and neutron star observations",
    "will then be possible .",
    "in the meantime , examinations of astrophysical implications of the eos constrained by heavy - ion reactions are useful . at the wci3 meeting in 2005 , horowitz suggested the heavy - ion physics community to investigate whether one can use the information from heavy - ion collisions to constrain the core - crust transition density in neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate timely how the behaviors of the @xmath3 constrained at sub - saturation densities by heavy - ion experiments may help limit the transition density @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 at the inner edge of neutron stars  @xcite .    to our best knowledge ,",
    "all existing studies indicate consistently that the transition density is very sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy  @xcite .",
    "very often , the so - called parabolic approximation ( pa ) to the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is used .",
    "while the pa is mathematically valid only at small isospin asymmetries , interestingly , it has been found empirically true even for large isospin asymmetries for nucleonic mater using most models and interactions , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "nevertheless , since the @xmath21 matter in the crust at @xmath22-equilibrium is highly neutron rich and the determination of the transition density depends on the second order derivatives of the energy density , the fine details of the eos can influence the transition density significantly as first pointed out by arponen in 1972  @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting and necessary to compare calculations using both the full eos and its parabolic approximation .",
    "indeed , we found that the pa leads to significantly different transition density and pressure compared to the calculations using the full eos .",
    "it should be mentioned that the pa may also significantly modify the proton fraction in @xmath22-equilibrium neutron - star matter and the critical density for the direct urca process which can lead to faster cooling of neutron stars  @xcite . to investigate effects of nuclear interactions we use a modified gogny ( mdi ) and @xmath2 skyrme interactions widely used in the literature .",
    "the same mdi interaction has been used in extracting the @xmath3 from heavy - ion reactions within a transport model  @xcite . using the @xmath3 constrained by the isospin diffusion data  @xcite",
    ", we can put a constraint on the transition density and pressure , respectively .",
    "we will then examine the implications of these constraints on the mass - radius correlation and the crustal fraction of the moment of inertia of neutron stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ two methods ]",
    "we briefly review the dynamical and thermodynamical methods widely used for locating the inner edge of neutron star crust , and derive their relationship analytically . in section [ eos ]",
    "we summarize the eos and symmetry energy obtained using the mdi interaction and @xmath2 skyrme interactions within the hartree - fock approach .",
    "we also examine the associated proton fraction and several thermodynamical properties including the energy density , pressure and the speed of sound in neutron star matter at @xmath22-equilibrium .",
    "the general formalisms for describing the structure of neutron stars are outlined in section [ nstarth ] .",
    "we thus present the results of our calculations and discuss several important issues regarding the transition density and the structure of neutron stars in section [ results ] .",
    "a summary is given in section [ summary ] .",
    "the inner edge of neutron star crust corresponds to the phase transition from the homogeneous matter at high densities to the inhomogeneous matter at low densities . in principle , the transition density @xmath0 can be obtained by comparing a detailed model of the nonuniform solid crust to the uniform liquid core in the neutron star . while this is practically very difficult since the inner crust may have a very complex structure , usually known as  nuclear pasta \" @xcite , it can be explored within several approaches including the molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite and the 3d hartree - fock model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the core - crust transition is thought to be a very weak first - order phase transition and model calculations lead to very small density discontinuities at the transition  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a well established approach for estimating the @xmath0 is to search for the density at which the uniform liquid first becomes unstable against small - amplitude density fluctuations , indicating the start of forming nuclear clusters.although some quantum effects such as the shell effects in more microscopic methods may influence the core - crust transition density , this approach has been shown to produce a very small error for the actual core - crust transition density and it would yield the exact transition density for a second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "presently , there are several such methods , such as , the dynamical method  @xcite , the thermodynamical method  @xcite and the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we use both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods .    in the following",
    ", we will first review briefly the dynamical method and the thermodynamical method , separately .",
    "while they are both well established and applied extensively in studying not only the core - crust transition in neutron stars but also the liquid - gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter , somewhat different results are often obtained .",
    "it is thus necessary to study in detail the differences and relations between them .",
    "we shall first show analytically that the thermodynamical method corresponds to the long - wavelength limit of the dynamical method when the coulomb interaction is neglected , and then compare numerically their predictions .      to describe small density fluctuations in the @xmath21 matter ,",
    "one can write the density of particle @xmath23 as  @xcite @xmath24 the density variation can be decoupled into plane - waves @xmath25 of wave vector @xmath26 and amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "this kind of density variation occurs when a momentum @xmath26 is transferred to the particle system , e.g. , through collisions and the  dynamical method \" is named after this .",
    "it has been shown that the variation of the free energy density generated by the density fluctuation of amplitude @xmath28 can be written as  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the free - energy curvature matrix .",
    "the instability region of the @xmath21 matter can be located by examining when the convexity of the free - energy curvature matrix is violated .",
    "the convexity of the matrix @xmath31 requires that @xmath32 here @xmath33 is always positive so we do not take it into consideration .",
    "if the system stays stable , the convexity of the matrix @xmath31 should be retained for all values of @xmath34 . the first term in the right hand of eq .",
    "( [ dymethod ] ) is the bulk term , which just defines the stability condition of the nuclear matter part as will be shown later . the second term in the right hand of eq .",

    ". the mdi interaction , however , does not have a gradient term . to remedy this drawback",
    "we set @xmath39 mev@xmath40@xmath41 as used in the work by oyamatsu et al .",
    "@xcite when we apply the mdi interaction .",
    "this choice is quite consistent with the empirical values from the shf calculations .",
    "we note here that the averaged value of @xmath42 and @xmath43 is , respectively , @xmath44 and @xmath45 mev@xmath40@xmath41 for the @xmath2 skyrme forces we will use in the following . furthermore ,",
    "as we will show later , the transition density and pressure are rather insensitive to the variation of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the last term in the right hand of eq .",
    "( [ dymethod ] ) is the coulomb term , which is generated by the coulomb interactions of electrons and protons .",
    "it should be noted that additional @xmath34-dependent terms due to the finite range of the mdi interaction via exchange terms as well as the coulomb exchange terms are neglected in eq .",
    "( [ dymethod ] ) . as we will show later",
    ", the bulk term dominates the result and the density gradient term and coulomb term are not important for the determination of the transition density and the associated transition pressure .",
    "the density gradient term and coulomb term usually make the system slightly more stable and thus reduce correspondingly the region of instability .    for small density fluctuations , to guarantee the convexity of the curvature matrix it is sufficient for the last determinant in eq .",

    "meanwhile , @xmath51 is assumed to be positive .",

    "in summary , we first analyzed the relationship between the well established dynamical and thermodynamical methods for locating the inner edge separating the uniform liquid core from the solid crust in neutron stars .",

    "moreover , it is shown that the results obtained from using the full expression of the eos for a given interaction are very similar for the two methods .",
