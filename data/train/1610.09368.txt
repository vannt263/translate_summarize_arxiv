    "the investigations of the properties of hadrons under extreme conditions have been in the focus of much attention for many years .",
    "such investigations are very important in the study of the internal structure of the dense astrophysical objects like neutron stars .",
    "the formation of neutron stars is influenced by all four known fundamental interactions .",
    "hence , understanding of their nature can help us in the course of unification of all fundamental forces within a common theoretical framework , which is one of the biggest challenges for physics .",
    "the recent observation of massive neutron stars with roughly twice the solar mass @xcite has stimulated the focuses on the equation of state of the dense nuclear matter ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , the expected appearance of hyperons at about two times nuclear density , called `` hyperon puzzle '' remains an unresolved mystery in neutron stars ( concerning the appearance of hyperons in neutron stars see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it has also found that @xmath0 isobars appear at a density of the order of @xmath5 times nuclear matter saturation density , and a `` @xmath0 puzzle '' exists , similar to the  hyperon puzzle  if the potential of the @xmath0 in nuclear matter is close to the one indicated by the experimental data @xcite .",
    "more theoretical and experimental investigations on the properties of strange and non - strange light baryons in dense medium are needed to solve such puzzles .    from the experimental side ,",
    "the bound nuclear systems with one , two or three units of strangeness are poorly known compared to that of the non - strange states like nucleons .",
    "the large production probability of various hyperon - antihyperon pairs in antiproton collisions will provide opportunities for series of new studies on the behavior of the systems containing two or even more units of strangeness at the @xmath4anda experiment at fair . by the progresses",
    "made , it will be possible to study the in - medium properties of the doubly strange @xmath6-hypernuclei as well as the multi - strange @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath3 systems in near future @xcite .",
    "from the theoretical side , the effects of nuclear medium on the physical parameters of the nucleon have been widely investigated in the literature ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "but , we have only a few studies dedicated to the in - medium properties of hyperons and decuplet baryons in the literature ( for instance see @xcite ) . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the impact of nuclear matter on some spectroscopic parameters of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 decuplet baryons .",
    "in particular , we calculate the mass and residue as well as the scalar and vector self energies of these baryons using the well established in - medium qcd sum rule approach .",
    "we compare the in - medium results with those obtained at @xmath9 or vacuum and find the corresponding shifts . to remove the contributions of the negative energy particles , we work at the rest frame of the nuclear matter and fix the three momentum of the particles under consideration .",
    "in this section we aim to construct sum rules for the mass , residue and vector self energy of the decuplet baryons and numerically analyze the obtained results . to this end and in accordance with the general philosophy of the qcd sum rule approach ,",
    "we start with a correlation function as the building block of the method : @xmath10|\\psi_0\\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the four momentum of the decuplet ( @xmath12 ) baryon , @xmath13 is the ground state of the nuclear matter and @xmath14 is the interpolating current of the @xmath12 baryon .",
    "the general form of the interpolating current for decuplet baryons in a compact form reads , @xmath15 where @xmath16 are color indices , @xmath17 is the charge conjugation operator and @xmath18 is the normalization constant .",
    "the quark content and value of @xmath18 for different members are given in table i @xcite .",
    ".the value of the normalization constant @xmath18 and the quark flavors @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 for the decuplet baryons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from this table , first of all , we see that our predictions on the masses in vacuum are in good consistencies with the average experimental data presented in pdg @xcite .",
    "the masses obtained in the nuclear medium show negative shifts for all decuplet baryons . from the values of the scalar self energy ( @xmath22 ) , demonstrating the shifts in the masses due to finite density , we deduce that the maximum shift in the masses , due to the nuclear medium , with amount of @xmath23 belongs to the @xmath0 baryon and its minimum , @xmath24 , corresponds to the @xmath3 state .",
    "this is an expected result since the @xmath0 state have the same quark content as the nuclear medium and is more affected by the nuclear matter . when going from @xmath0 to @xmath3 the up and down quarks",
    "are replaced with the strange quark .",
    "the @xmath3 state , having three @xmath25 quarks , is less affected by the medium .",
    "the small shifts in the parameters of @xmath3 may be attributed to the intrinsic strangeness in the nucleons .    in the case of the residues ,",
    "our predictions in vacuum are overall comparable with those obtained in @xcite within the errors .",
    "the small differences may be linked to different input parameters used in these works .",
    "the values of residues are also considerably affected by the medium .",
    "the shift in the residue of @xmath0 with amount of @xmath26 is maximum .",
    "the residue of @xmath3 again is minimally affected by the medium with amount of roughly @xmath27 .",
    "the value of vector self energy is considerably large in all decuplet channels .",
    "it is again systematically reduced when going from the @xmath0 to @xmath3 baryon .",
    "our results may be confronted with the experimental data of @xmath4anda collaboration at fair and nica facility .",
    "however , we should remark that those experiments correspond to heavy ion collisions and not exactly to a nuclear medium .",
    "hence , the appropriate way to make such comparison would be to present sum rules at finite density but where the density is introduced through the baryonic chemical potential .",
    "this offers the possibility of exploring a wide range of densities .",
    "we worked with the nuclear matter density since the the in - medium condensates are available as functions of nuclear matter density not chemical potential and we extracted the zero - density ( vacuum ) sum rules , as a means of normalizing the finite density sum rules , to compare the results with the available experimental data and other theoretical predictions in vacuum .",
