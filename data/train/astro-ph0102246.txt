    "the disk - galaxies are constructed in dynamical equilibrium ( hernquist , 1993 ) and consist of an exponential stellar and gaseous disk of the same mass , a bulge with a hernquist - profile , and a pseudo - isothermal dark halo .",
    "the small galaxy has 1/3 of the mass and 1/3 of the particles of the massive one .",
    "the scale length is reduced by @xmath2 . in total",
    "we used 88888 collisionless particles and 26666 gas particles simulated using sph with an isothermal equation of state .",
    "both galaxies approach each other on nearly parabolic prograde orbits with slightly inclined disks relative to the orbital plane .",
    "the simulations were performed on a sun ultra 60 workstation .",
    "the hypothesis that pure stellar 3:1 mergers of disk galaxies lead to fast rotating and isotropic ( barnes , 1998 ) , disky galaxies ( naab , burkert & hernquist , 1999 ) is tested with a model that also follows the evolution of a massive gas component . if only the stellar part is taken into account the remnant still follows a @xmath3 profile ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it has predominantly disky isophotes , isotropic velocity dispersion and a small amount of minor - axis rotation , although the amount of diskiness is significantly reduced and the remnant has a much rounder shape . in 1:1 mergers",
    "most of the gas accumulates in a central gas knot ( barnes & hernquist , 1996 ; mihos & hernquist , 1996 ) .",
    "in contrast , the gas in 3:1 mergers has much larger specific angular momentum .",
    "it therefore settles into an extended inner disk component ( figure 1 ) .",
    "simulations like this can help to understand the formation of disky elliptical galaxies or the formation of central power - law or disk - like structures that are observed in fast rotating elliptical galaxies ( faber et al .",
    "the detailed influence of gas on the global structure and formation of elliptical galaxies is not well understood and might depend strongly on the star formation history which has been excluded in the present simulations .",
