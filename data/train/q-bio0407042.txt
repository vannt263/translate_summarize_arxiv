    "the meningococcus is a major cause of meningitis and septicaemia . despite this , infection with the meningococcus",
    "is mostly harmless and only rarely leads to disease .",
    "transmission of the disease is almost exclusively through asymptomatic carriers of the disease .",
    "a predominant feature of the epidemiology of meningococcal disease are outbreaks of variable scale and duration .",
    "the meningococcal population is genetically highly diverse .",
    "we have shown , using a mathematical model , that heritable diversity with respect to pathogenic potential can lead to disease outbreaks @xcite .",
    "meningococcal disease is a a notifiable disease in many countries .",
    "therefore there exist extensive data sets on the incidence of meningococcal disease .",
    "the analysis of meningococcal disease data is problematic because the number of asymptomatic carriers at any time , the variable that is probably of most interest , is normally not known because transmission of the pathogen takes place almost exclusively through asymptomatic carriers",
    ". therefore key epidemiological parameters are difficult to estimate and methods that are standard in epidemiology , such as outbreak reconstruction through contact tracing , can not easily be applied . for this reason outbreaks of meningococcal disease",
    "are difficult to reconstruct and to detect .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the statistical structure of an epidemiological model to infer the underlying disease process from data on the number of cases of disease .",
    "such insights have been applied in the analysis of meningococcal disease data @xcite . here",
    "we will investigate the validity of the assumptions made for these inferences and study how the variance in the number of cases of disease depends on the structure of the population .",
    "we study the siryx model , considered in @xcite .",
    "the model is an extension of the sir model@xcite .",
    "there are two types of infected individuals , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3 s are generated by mutation from the @xmath2 s at rate @xmath4 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the back mutation rate @xmath5 is nil .",
    "the @xmath3 population can develop disease at rate @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is the pathogenicity : the probability to develop disease upon infection .",
    "we define the number of individuals which suffer the disease @xmath7 .",
    "we further simplify the model by assuming that these individuals are removed from the population .",
    "the mean field equations are : @xmath8 the only difference with respect to the model studied in@xcite is the introduction of a the rate @xmath9 at which the @xmath7 individuals are removed from the population ( see below ) .",
    "this rate implies , that , in the long run , the only stationary situation is the conversion of all individuals into the @xmath7 type , and their eventual disappearance .",
    "we will study here quasisatationary situations which arise when @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider that the system is near its stable point when @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the remaining parameters at the fixed point are : @xmath13    assuming that the fixed point values for @xmath14 and @xmath2 do not change much for small @xmath15 , we can define a simple birth - death model for the variables @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "we define @xmath16 , as the probability of finding the value @xmath3 at time @xmath17 .",
    "this function satisfies : @xmath18 p ( y-1 , t ) { \\nonumber}\\\\ & + & a ( y+ 1 ) p ( y + 1 , t ) - ( b y + a y + c ) p ( y , t ) \\label{partial}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the death rate , @xmath19 , birth rate , @xmath20 and rate of creation of a new individuals by mutation , @xmath21 .",
    "we generalize this equation to the case of a system divided into @xmath22 patches .",
    "the main difference is that the birth probability has to be divided into the probability that the contagion is to another individual within the same patch , which we still define as @xmath23 , and the probability that the contagion leads to a new individual of type @xmath3 in another patch , @xmath24 .",
    "the total infection rate remains @xmath25 .",
    "the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ partial ] ) is : @xmath26 note that in this equation @xmath27 is the mutation rate within one patch .",
    "the total mutation rate is @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 we recover the limit of a well mixed population , while for @xmath30 the patches are decoupled .",
    "from eq.([partial_2 ] ) we can calculate the ensemble means of different quantities .",
    "the details of the calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "the results are : @xmath31 } { [ { a - b - ( m - 1 ) b'}]^2 ( a - b + b ' ) } \\nonumber \\\\   { \\langle y_i y_j \\rangle - \\langle y_i \\rangle \\langle y_j \\rangle}&= & \\frac{a b ' c } { [ { a - b - ( m - 1 ) b'}]^2 ( a - b + b ' ) } \\label{averages}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all these quantities vanish when the mutation rate is zero , @xmath32 .    the net growth rate is @xmath33 . the number of infected cases appear with rate @xmath34 .",
    "we now calculate the number of infected individuals , @xmath35 .",
    "we study first the case of a single population and a single variable @xmath7 .",
    "the infected individuals are generated from the @xmath3 s at rate @xmath36 . in order to calculate @xmath7 in a single population , we use as unit of time @xmath37 , and",
    "assume that the death rate of the @xmath7 s is @xmath9 .",
    "we write the mutation rate @xmath38 . then , we can write : @xmath39 + { \\nonumber}\\\\ & + & \\delta \\left [ ( x + 1 ) p ( x + 1 , y , t ) - x p ( x , y , t ) \\right ] - \\gamma p ( x , y , t ) \\label{ev_x } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used as the unit of time @xmath37 , @xmath1 is now the rate of conversion from @xmath3 into @xmath7 , @xmath9 is the death rate of the @xmath7 s , and @xmath40 is the mutation rate from @xmath2 into @xmath3 . using the techniques described in the appendix , we can write : @xmath41 in a stationary state the right hand side of these equations is equal to zero , and we find : @xmath42 we substitute the first and third of these equations into the second , so that : @xmath43 from eq.([ev_x ] ) we also obtain @xmath44 . inserting this result into eq.([av_x ] ) , we have : @xmath45 this equation relates the variance and the average of @xmath7 .",
    "when the mortality rate is very high , @xmath46 , we have : @xmath47 the ratio approaches a constant of order unity , and the process seems to have poisson statistics .",
    "this is reasonable , because there is an approximately constant reservoir of @xmath3 individuals which can lead to an @xmath7 individual which disappears quickly , and the distribution of @xmath7 cases is not influenced by the fluctuations of @xmath3 .",
    "a more interesting regime arises if @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then , the r.h.s . in eq.([var_x ] ) is dominated by the third term , because @xmath50 .",
    "we find in this case : @xmath51 this result is the basis of the following section . note that when @xmath52 the value of @xmath53 increases linearly with time .",
    "using the results in the appendix and eq.([var_final ] ) we find ( for @xmath54 ) : @xmath55 } { [ { a - b - ( m - 1 ) b ' } ] ( a - b + b ' ) } \\label{varxi}\\ ] ] on the other hand , for the entire system we obtain : @xmath56 the linear relationship between the variance and the mean is discussed in detail in@xcite .    for isolated patches , @xmath30 and @xmath57 . as expected , the local and global values , eq.([varxi ] ) and eq.([varx ] )",
    "coincide , giving a ratio equal to @xmath58 .    in a well mixed population",
    ", we have @xmath59 , the total birth rate is @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "then , we find : @xmath62 for a small subsystem of a well mixed population ( @xmath63 ) , we have @xmath64 .",
    "this ratio would imply that the process is due to random mutations with poisson statistics .",
    "an analysis of the total variance , however , gives a rather different result .",
    "for large ( but artificial ) subdivisions of the well mixed system , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the situation in which populations of size @xmath67 below some size @xmath68 are part of a well mixed population of size @xmath68 , while larger populations can be considered as isolated . made up of smaller , decoupled populations of size @xmath68 .",
    "then , for populations @xmath69 we can use eq.([var_par ] ) with @xmath70 ( @xmath71 is the value of the mean of a population of size @xmath68 ) , while when @xmath72 we can use eq.([var_tot ] ) .",
    "the variance can be written as : @xmath73 .",
    "eq.([varn ] ) interpolates between a poisson like regime for @xmath74 to a @xmath75 ratio between the variance and the mean for @xmath76 .",
