    "this paper has been inspired by the results of davis ( 1999 ) for the random walks perturbed at extrema .",
    "davis ( 1999 ) studied the stochastic process which is the limit one of the walks described below .",
    "our purpose here is to study the properties of these perturbed walks as they are , without considering the limit process found in davis ( 1999 ) .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "fix a number @xmath2 which is either a positive integer or @xmath3 .",
    "we define a _ perturbed at @xmath2-extrema random walk _ @xmath4 as a nearest - neighbour random walk on @xmath5 with the transitional probabilities @xmath6 equal to \\",

    "for definiteness , if @xmath7 is both the maximum and the minimum , we let this probability be @xmath8 ( this obviously happens only when @xmath9 ) .    when @xmath2 is finite , we will call this walk _ a walk with finite memory_. in this case , it is natural to think of this process as of a `` snake '' ( hence the title of the paper , compare our process with a famous video game , released during the mid 1970s , see surhone , tennoe , and henssonow ( 2010 ) ) of length @xmath2 units moving on the integers , whose transition probabilities depend on whether the snake is surrounded by parts of its body or not .",
    "the case @xmath10 corresponds to the walk perturbed at global extrema , and we will refer to this walk as the walk with _",
    "infinite memory_. it was shown in davis ( 1999 ) that this walk , properly rescaled , converges to a certain stochastic process .",
    "other relevant papers are davis ( 1990 , 1996 ) ; benjamini and wilson ( 2003 ) and volkov ( 2003 ) studied an excited random walk ( erw ) , which transitional probabilities differ when the walk visits a site for the first time .",
    "zerner ( 2005 ) studied multi - excited random walks on integers .",
    "more recently , basdevant and singh ( 2008a ) got some interesting results on the speed of erw , confirming certain conjectures posed in zerner ( 2005 ) , and computed the exact rate of growth in the zero - speed regime in ( 2008b ) , while kosygina and zerner ( 2008 ) obtained annealed clt for erw , using branching theory techniques .",
    "when @xmath10 , our process can be viewed as a special erw as follows .",
    "consider a site @xmath7 on a positive axis , and place a geometric number @xmath11 of cookies at the site , such that @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 , @xmath14 , are i.i.d .",
    "random variables . whenever the walk visits site @xmath7 and there are at least two cookie there , it eats one cookie and goes to the left .",
    "when it eats the last cookie , it goes to the right .",
    "finally , when there are no cookies left at a site , the walk goes left or right with equal probabilities . on the negative axis ,",
    "the process is defined similarly with the number of the cookies there distributed according to the law @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "there are no cookies at site @xmath17 .",
    "note that in kosygina and zerner ( 2008 ) the number of cookies is uniformly bounded , which is not the case in our model ; also our model resembles _ drilling random walk _ introduced in volkov ( 2003 ) .    in section  [ infmem ] , for @xmath10 we focus on the behaviour of the process in _ finite time _ , as opposed to davis ( 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain some results on the time it takes before the length of the visited ( `` cookie - free '' ) area reaches a certain value .",
    "we also compute the limiting probability to be at the global maxima , given that the walk is at one of its extrema .",
    "in section [ finmem ] , for @xmath18 , the process does not resemble erw mentioned above , and can be viewed as a markov chain on a product space of @xmath19 .",
    "we establish that the finite memory walk is recurrent if and only if @xmath20 ( compare this with the case @xmath10 when the walk is always recurrent ) .",
    "also we obtain strong law and clt for our process , and show how the speed of the transient process , when @xmath21 , decays as @xmath2 grows .",
    "we conclude with conjecture and open problems in section [ conj ] .",
    "before we proceed with the next section , let us introduce a few notations .",
    "let & = ( k ) = _ l(k)&=_i=1,2, ",
    ",lk x_k+1-i , + & = ( k ) = _ l(k)&=_i=1,2,",
    "x_k+1-i . if @xmath22 and @xmath23 then our process behaves exactly as a simple random walk ( srw ) .",
    "the only differences between @xmath4 and the srw occur when either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the range ( the spread ) of the walk and @xmath27 be the stopping time when this range reaches @xmath28 . at some point",
    "we will interested in the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "these notations @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 will be used throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we establish some interesting properties of the perturbed random walks with infinite memory .    to characterize its distribution , without loss of generality suppose that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and let @xmath37 be the random time until the range is increased given that the walk starts at @xmath38 , @xmath39 . since @xmath40 , the laplace transform of @xmath41 satisfies [ lapeq ] _ 0&=&e^-[q_1+(1-q)1 ] ,  l=0 ; + _ l&=&e^-[0.5_l-1 + 0.5_l+1 ] ,  0<l < n ; + _ n&=&e^-[p1+(1-p)_n-1 ] ,  l = n , it can be represented for @xmath42 as _",

    "the next increase will take place again at the maximum ( resp .",
    "minimum ) . then these probabilities satisfy p_=p+(1-p)(n p _ + 1n ( 1-p _ ) ) , + p_=1-q+q(n p _ + 1n ( 1-p _ ) ) .",
    "the solution to this system is [ pmm ] p_=p_(n)= , + p_=p_(n)=. for large @xmath28 both probabilities are close to one : p_(n)=1-p 1n + o(n^-2),p_(n)=1-q1-q1n + o(n^-2 ) .",

    "moreover , the event @xmath149 has a positive probability , consequently a positive fraction of times @xmath120 will achieve new local minimum right after it is a local minimum , while @xmath48 will go the right .",
    "hence , @xmath150 .    here",
    "we will have to construct a series of couplings , as the argument of case 2b unfortunately can not be applied directly .",
    "we will also work directly with @xmath98 rather than with @xmath48 ; clearly , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the values determined also by the process @xmath98 .",
    "first , we construct the second process @xmath153 similar to @xmath98 with @xmath154 but with @xmath155 .",
    "observe that the process @xmath156 is symmetric and define the corresponding markov chain @xmath120 for @xmath156 in the same way @xmath48 was defined .",
    "start with @xmath157 .",
    "draw a @xmath158 random variable and go to the right if this variable s less than @xmath159 and left otherwise . at the @xmath160-th stage , draw an independent @xmath158 random variable , and move to the right for the asymmetric chain , @xmath161 @xmath162 similarly , move to the right for the symmetric chain , @xmath163 , @xmath164 observe that both processes follow the same path till they hit a local maximum , say , at the @xmath165-st step .",

    "our second step is to show by induction that @xmath167 , in fact , for all @xmath160 .",
    "assume that @xmath168 , for all @xmath169 , and if for some @xmath160 , @xmath170 , then @xmath171 .",
    "we now show that asymmetric process goes ahead of the symmetric process .    in the table below we write all the possibilities for the two processes at the @xmath172-th step , and then in each cell we write the pair of probabilities to move to the right .",
    "the first number in the brackets is the probability for @xmath98 and the second number is the one for the symmetric process @xmath156 .

    "now for cells @xmath180 or @xmath181 , if @xmath182 is at the local maximum and @xmath183 , then @xmath184 must also be at the local maximum ( since @xmath185 by the assumption of induction ) , which contradicts the fact that @xmath184 is not at local maximum .",
    "therefore , @xmath186 .",
    "hence at the @xmath187-st step if the processes do move not in the same direction , then they would be at most equal , i.e. , @xmath188 .    finally , for cell @xmath189 ,",
    "if @xmath184 is at local minimum and @xmath190 , then @xmath182 must also be at the local minimum ( since @xmath191 ) , which contradicts the fact that @xmath182 is at neither local max nor local min . thus again",
    "@xmath186 and if they make opposite moves at the @xmath187-st step they would be at most equal : @xmath188 as before .",
    "hence we conclude the proof by induction that @xmath167 for all @xmath160 and some times @xmath171 .",
    "the third step consists in using regeneration arguments .",
    "let @xmath192 be the first time @xmath160 when @xmath193 , which is obviously finite as it is stochastically bounded by a geometric random variable with parameter @xmath194 . at time @xmath192",

    "this , in turn , implies that k/|>0 after applying the renewal law of large numbers ( theorem 1.7.3 from @xcite ) for the sequence @xmath212 .    finally , in our fourth step",
