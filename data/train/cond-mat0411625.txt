    "a common problem is that our beliefs and our knowledge are often represented by a probability distribution @xmath0 that is too complicated to be useful for practical calculations and we need to find a more tractable approximation .",
    "a possible solution is to identify a family of trial distributions @xmath1 and select the member of the family that is closest  to the exact  distribution @xmath0 .",
    "the problem , of course , is that it is not clear what one means by ` closest ' .",
    "we could minimize @xmath2 ^{2}~,\\]]but why this particular functional and not another ? and also , why limit oneself to an approximation by a single member of the trial family ? why not consider some linear combination of the trial distributions , some kind of average over the trial family ?",
    "but then , how should we choose the optimal weight assigned to each @xmath3 ? and again , what does ` optimal ' mean ? we propose to tackle these questions using the method of maximum entropy .",
    "the method of maximum entropy as advocated by jaynes ( maxent ) is a method to assign probabilities on the basis of partial information @xcite .",
    "the core of the maxent method resides in interpreting entropy , through the shannon axioms , as a measure of the `` amount of uncertainty '' or of the `` amount of information that is missing '' in a probability distribution .",
    "this was an important step forward because it extended the applicability of the notion of entropy far beyond its original roots in thermodynamics but it was not entirely free from objections .",
    "for example , one problem is that the shannon axioms refer to probabilities of discrete variables ; the entropy of continuous distributions was not defined .",
    "a second , perhaps more serious problem is that other measures of uncertainty were subsequently found .",
    "this immediately raised the question of which among the alternatives should one choose and motivated attempts to justify the method of maximum entropy directly as a method of inductive inference without referring to any specific measure of uncertainty @xcite-@xcite .",
    "what eventually emerged is an extended form of the method of maximum entropy , which we abbreviate as me to distinguish it from the original maxent .",
    "the core of me is a concept of ( relative ) entropy that reduces to the usual entropy in the special case of a uniform prior or uniform background measure and that does not require an interpretation in terms of heat , disorder , uncertainty , or even in terms of an amount of information : in the context of me _ entropy needs no interpretation_.    the me method is designed for processing information , for updating from a prior probability distribution ( which in statistical mechanics is generally postulated to be uniform ) to a posterior distribution when new information in the form of constraints becomes available @xcite .",
    "the chosen posterior distribution should coincide with the prior as closely as possible : me implements the minimal changes that are required to satisfy the new constraints .",
    "the significance of this development is that it allows one to tackle problems lying beyond the restricted scope of maxent caticha03b .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to extend the use of the me method beyond processing information to a method to generate approximations footnote2 ; a second purpose is to illustrate the method by applying it to simple fluids .    the general formalism , which is the main result of this paper , is developed in section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ sec2 - 1 ] we justify the use of relative entropy as the uniquely natural criterion to select the best approximation . in section  [ sec2 - 2 ] , as a simple illustration , the me method is applied to trial distributions of the canonical boltzmann - gibbs form .",
    "the result , when expressed in terms of free energies , is recognized as the bogoliubov variational principle @xcite , which is now seen as a special case of me @xcite .",
    "the first part of our paper concludes in section  [ sec2 - 3 ] with a quantitative analysis of the extent to which the distribution that maximizes the relative entropy is preferred over other members of the trial family .",
    "we show that our entropic argument does not completely rule out those distributions that fail to maximize the entropy .",
    "therefore a suitably weighed average over the whole family of trial distributions with the optimal weight calculated using the me method provides a better approximation than can be expected from any individual member of the trial family .",
    "the discussion up to this point is general  the me method of generating best approximations is of general applicability  but it is useful to see how it is applied to a specific problem .",
    "in the second part of the paper we apply the me method to simple classical fluids .",
    "the study of classical fluids is an old and mature field .",
    "there exist extensive treatments in many excellent books and reviews @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our goal is to use this well - explored but still non - trivial field as a testing ground for the me method . at this early stage in the development of the me method",
    "we are not concerned with contributing to the study of the fluids themselves .",
    "indeed , the reason we choose such a well - explored problem , is not because we are eager to find new results about fluids but because we can compare our results with those obtained using alternative approximation methods already in existence .",
    "we find that our results are quite competitive with those obtained using the best perturbative methods developed to date .",
    "the practical success or failure of the method hinges on choosing a family of trial distributions that incorporates the information that is relevant to the problem of interest . in our example",
    " simple fluids  it turns out that their structure is dominated , particularly at liquid densities , by the short - range repulsions between molecules .",
    "the effects of the long - range attractions are averaged over many molecules and are less important , except at low densities .",
    "accordingly we choose a fluid of hard spheres barkerhenderson76-@xcite as our ( almost ) tractable trial model ( section  [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "the me method is then used ( section  [ sec4 ] ) to select the optimal value of the hard - sphere diameter .",
    "this is equivalent to applying the bogoliubov variational principle and reproduces the results obtained by by mansoori et al .",
    "@xcite , and independently by stell at al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a very different approximation scheme can be traced back to lewis who used a maximum entropy argument to derive the boltzmann equation @xcite , and was further developed by karkheck , stell and coworkers @xcite . instead of selecting the optimal distribution from within a family of trial approximations , which is what we do here , in their kinetic variational theory  an entropy",
    "is maximized to determine the optimal closure for the bbgky hierarchy of equations .",
    "their method is suitable for tackling transport problems in dense simple fluids with potentials that are more realistic than just hard spheres .",
    "alternative approaches to the study of fluids include perturbation theory . in such schemes",
    "the intermolecular potential @xmath4 is written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a strong short - range repulsion , which is eventually approximated by a hard - sphere potential @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a long - range attraction treated as a perturbation . at high densities",
    "first order theory is quite accurate but at lower densities higher - order corrections must be included .",
    "there exist several proposals for how to separate @xmath4 into @xmath6 and @xmath8 , for choosing the particular stage in the calculation where @xmath6 is replaced by @xmath7 , and also for choosing the best hard - sphere diameter .",
    "the most successful are those by barker and henderson @xcite and by weeks , chandler and andersen ( wca ) @xcite .",
    "the latter succeeds in using the hard - sphere potential @xmath7 while effectively representing some of the effects of the soft - core potential @xmath6 . for a recent discussion of some of the strengths and limitations of the perturbative approach see @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the variational and the me methods over the perturbative approaches is that there is no need for ad hoc criteria dictating how to separate @xmath4 into @xmath6 and @xmath8 , and how to choose a hard - sphere diameter .",
    "a disadvantage of the standard variational approach is that it fails to take the softness of the repulsive core into account , which leads , at high temperatures , to results that are inferior to the perturbative approaches . as we shall see below this limitation",
    "does not apply to the me method .",
    "the standard variational approach allows one to select the optimal value of a parameter , in this case the hard - sphere diameter ; all non - optimal values are ruled out .",
    "but , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the me method allows one to quantify the extent to which non - optimal values should contribute . in this more complete use of the me method ( presented in section  [ sec5 ] ) the `` exact '' probability distribution of the fluid",
    "is approximated by a statistical mixture of distributions corresponding to hard spheres of different diameters .",
    "this is a rather simple and elegant way to take into account the fact that the actual atoms are not hard spheres .",
    "the full me analysis leads to significant improvements over the variational method .",
    "in section  [ sec6 ] we test our method by comparing its predictions for a lennard - jones model for argon with the numerical molecular dynamics simulation data ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the me predictions for thermodynamic variables and for the radial distribution function are considerable improvements over the standard bogoliubov variational result , and are comparable to the perturbative results . finally , our conclusions and some remarks on further improvements are presented in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "the goal is to select from a family of trial distributions @xmath9 ( the possible posteriors ) that which is closest to a given `` exact '' distribution @xmath0 ( the prior ) .",
    "the family of trials can be defined in a variety of ways .",
    "for example , one can specify a functional form @xmath10 , each member of the trial family being labelled by one or more parameters @xmath11 .",
    "more generally , one could define the trial family in a non - parametric way by specifying various constraints .",
    "the discussion below which develops the use of me to generate approximations follows @xcite where the me  method is developed for a different purpose , namely , as a method for processing information to update distributions .",
    "the selection of one distribution from within a family is achieved by ranking the distributions according to increasing _ preference_.",
    "before we address the issue of what it is that makes one distribution preferable over another we note that there is one feature we must impose on any ranking scheme .",
    "the feature is transitivity : if distribution @xmath12 is preferred over distribution @xmath13 , and @xmath13 is preferred over @xmath14 , then @xmath15 is preferred over @xmath14 .",
    "such transitive rankings are implemented by assigning to each @xmath3 a real number @xmath16 $ ] which we call the `` entropy '' of @xmath17 .",
    "the numbers @xmath16 $ ] are such that if @xmath12 is preferred over @xmath13 , then @xmath18>s[p_{2}]$ ] .",
    "thus , by design , the `` best '' approximation @xmath17 is that which maximizes the entropy @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "next we determine the functional form of @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "this is the general rule that provides the criterion for preference ; in our case it defines what we mean by the `` closest '' or `` best '' approximation .",
    "the basic strategy skilling88 is one of induction : ( 1 ) if a general rule exists , then it must apply to special cases ; ( 2 ) if in a certain special case we know which is the best approximation , then this knowledge can be used to constrain the form of @xmath16 $ ] ; and finally , ( 3 ) if enough special cases are known , then @xmath19 $ ] will be completely determined .    the known special cases are called the axioms  of me and they reflect the conviction that one should not change one s mind frivolously , that whatever information was originally codified into the exact @xmath0 is important and should be preserved .",
    "the selected trial distribution should coincide with the exact one as closely as possible and one should only tolerate those minimal changes that are demanded by the information that defines the family of trials .",
    "three axioms and their consequences are listed below .",
    "detailed proofs and more extensive comments are given in @xcite .",
    "* axiom 1 : locality*. _ local information has local effects .",
    "_ if the constraints that define the trial family do _ not _ refer to a certain domain @xmath20 of the variable @xmath21 , then the conditional probabilities @xmath22 need _ not _ be revised , @xmath23 .",
    "the consequence of the axiom is that non - overlapping domains of @xmath21 contribute additively to the entropy : @xmath16=\\int dx\\,f(p(x),x)$ ] where @xmath24 is some unknown function .",
    "the motivation behind this axiom is the following .",
    "suppose that the information , that is , the constraint , that defines the trial family , does not refer to a particular subdomain @xmath20 of the variable @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the probability of @xmath21 conditional on its being in @xmath20 is completely unsconstrained , and @xmath25 can take whatever value we desire . in other words ,",
    "the family of trial distributions includes members that are capable of reproducing the conditional probability @xmath26 exactly .",
    "axiom 1 says that if we can reproduce @xmath26 exactly then we should ; that is , among the possible trials choose one such that @xmath23 .",
    "clearly this is not just a good approximation , it is the best we can possibly do .",
    "* axiom 2 : coordinate invariance . * _ the ranking should not depend on the system of coordinates . _ the coordinates that label the points @xmath21 are arbitrary ; they carry no information .",
    "the consequence of this axiom is that @xmath19=\\int dx\\,p(x)f(p(x)/m(x))$ ] involves coordinate invariants such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where the function @xmath29 is a density , and both functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , at this point , unknown .",
    "next we make a second use of axiom 1 ( locality ) .",
    "when there are no constraints at all the family of trials includes the exact @xmath0 and the selected trial should coincide with @xmath0 ; that is , the best approximation to @xmath0 is @xmath0 itself .",
    "the consequence is that up to normalization the previously unknown density @xmath29 is the exact distribution @xmath0 .",
    "* axiom 3 :  consistency for independent subsystems*. _ when a system is composed of subsystems that are believed to be independent it should not matter whether the approximation procedure treats them separately or jointly . _",
    "specifically , if @xmath32 , and the exact distributions for the subsystems , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are respectively approximated by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then the exact distribution for the whole system @xmath37 should be approximated by @xmath38 .",
    "this axiom restricts the function @xmath31 to be a logarithm .",
    "the overall consequence of these axioms is that the trial approximations @xmath39 should be ranked relative to the exact @xmath0 according to their ( relative ) entropy , @xmath40=-\\int dx\\,p(x)\\log \\frac{p(x)}{p(x)}.   \\label{s[p|p]}\\]]the derivation has singled out the relative entropy @xmath41 $ ] as _ the unique functional to be used for the purpose of selecting an optimal approximation_. other functionals , may be useful for other purposes , but they are not a generalization from the simple cases described in the axioms above .      as an illustration",
    "consider a system with microstates labelled by @xmath42 ( for example , the location in phase space or perhaps the values of spin variables ) .",
    "let the probability that the microstate lies within a particular range @xmath43 be given by the canonical distribution @xmath44where @xmath45we want to approximate the `` exact '' @xmath46 by a more tractable distribution @xmath17 .",
    "the first step is to identify a family of trial distributions that are simple enough that actual calculations are feasible and that incorporates the appropriate relevant information .",
    "this step is difficult because there is no known systematic procedure to carry it out ; it is a matter of trial and error guided by intuition .",
    "we will consider a family of trial distributions @xmath47 that are canonical with a hamiltonian @xmath48 that depends on parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50where @xmath51the next step is to select the @xmath52 that maximizes @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "substituting into eq.([s[p|p ] ] ) gives , @xmath54=\\beta \\left ( \\langle h_{\\theta } -h\\rangle _ { \\theta } -f_{\\theta } + f\\right ) \\ , ,   \\label{s[ptheta|p]}\\]]where @xmath55 refers to averages over the trial @xmath56 .",
    "the inequality @xmath57\\leq 0 $ ] , can then be written as @xmath58thus , maximizing @xmath57 $ ] is equivalent to minimizing the quantity @xmath59 .",
    "this alternate form of the variational principle and its use to generate approximations is well known .",
    "it is usually associated with the name of bogoliubov @xcite and it is the main technique to generate mean field approximations for discrete systems of spins on a lattice .",
    "what is perhaps not as widely known is that the bogoliubov variational principle is just the special case of applying the me method to trial distributions of the canonical boltzmann - gibbs form .",
    "the example above does not exhaust the power of the memethod : we have found a way to determine the optimal choice of @xmath11 but me allows us to go further and quantify the extent to which the optimal @xmath60 is preferred over other non - optimal values ( @xcite , caticha00 ) .",
    "to what extent do we believe that any particular @xmath11 should have been chosen ?",
    "this is a question about the probability of @xmath11 , @xmath61 .",
    "the original problem of assigning a probability to @xmath42 is now broadened into assigning probabilities to @xmath42 and @xmath11 .  here",
    ", we use me not just to find the optimal approximation @xmath62 but also to find the optimal joint distribution @xmath63 .",
    "notice that this is the kind of problem where it is necessary to adopt a bayesian interpretation of probabilities . within a frequentist interpretation it makes no sense to talk about @xmath61 or @xmath63 because @xmath11 is not a random variable ; the value of @xmath11 is unknown but it is not random .    to proceed",
    "we must address two questions .",
    "first , what is the prior distribution , that is , what do we know about @xmath42 and @xmath11 before we are given the constraints ? and second , what are the constraints that define the family of joint trials @xmath63 ?    when we know nothing about the @xmath11s we know neither their physical meaning nor whether there is any relation to the @xmath42 .",
    "a joint prior @xmath64 that reflects this lack of correlations is a product , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the `` exact '' distribution , say eq.([p(q ) ] ) , and @xmath67  should reflect our ignorance about @xmath11 : it should be as uniform as possible and make every volume element in @xmath11 space as likely as any other .",
    "but if we know absolutely nothing about @xmath11 we also do not know how to measure volumes in @xmath11 space .    to make further progress",
    "we need the additional information that provides meaning to the @xmath11s , namely , that they are parameters labeling the family of distributions @xmath47 .",
    "remarkably this is sufficient to allow us to introduce a measure of distance in @xmath11 space that is both natural and unique : we define the distance between @xmath11 and @xmath68 to be the same as the distance between the corresponding @xmath56 and @xmath69 which is given by the fisher - rao metric @xmath70 , where @xmath71this is the only riemannian metric that takes proper account of the fact that the @xmath11s are not just structureless points but represent probability distributions @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the volume of a small region @xmath72 is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the determinant of @xmath75 .",
    "up to an irrelevant normalization , the distribution @xmath67 that is uniform in @xmath11 is given by @xmath76 .",
    "the second question about the constraints that define the family of trials is straightforward : of all joint distributions @xmath77 we are only interested in the subset of those distributions such that @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the trials @xmath63 are constrained to be of the form @xmath79 .",
    "now we allow the me method to take over : the best approximation @xmath80 to the joint distribution @xmath81 is obtained by maximizing the entropy@xmath82=-\\int dq\\,d\\theta \\,p(\\theta ) p_{\\theta } ( q)\\,\\log \\frac{p(\\theta ) p_{\\theta } ( q)}{\\gamma ^{1/2}(\\theta ) p(q ) } ,   \\label{sigma[p]}\\]]by varying @xmath61 subject to @xmath83 . the final result for the probability that @xmath11 lies within the small volume @xmath84 is @xmath85}\\gamma ^{1/2}(\\theta ) d\\theta \\text{~ } ,   \\label{p(theta)}\\]]where @xmath86 is a normalization constant .",
    "eq.([p(theta ) ] ) tells us that the preferred value of @xmath11 maximizes the entropy @xmath57 $ ] , eq.([s[ptheta|p ] ] ) , because this maximizes the probability density @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "it also tells us the degree to which values of @xmath11 away from the maximum are ruled out .",
    "for macroscopic systems the preference for the me distribution can be overwhelming .",
    "note also that the density @xmath87 $ ] is a scalar function and the presence of the jacobian factor @xmath88 makes eq.([p(theta ) ] ) manifestly invariant under changes of the coordinates @xmath11 .    finally , now that we have determined the joint distribution @xmath89 we can marginalize @xmath11 and use the average @xmath90as the best approximation we can construct out of the given trial family .",
    "this approximation is expected to be better than any individual @xmath91 for the same reason that the mean is expected to be a better estimator than the mode  it minimizes the variance .",
    "this idea of introducing mixtures of probability distributions as in eq.(pbar ) might seem strange at first sight but it is actually quite natural .",
    "for example , if we know that a system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath92 then we describe its macrostate using the canonical distribution .",
    "but if we are uncertain about the actual value of the temperature then a better description is given by a suitable weighted average over @xmath92 .",
    "eq.([p(theta ) ] ) gives the appropriate weights .",
    "the procedure above is mathematically straightforward but the shift from the original problem of assigning a probability to @xmath42 into the new problem of assigning probabilities to @xmath42 and @xmath11 can be a potential source of confusion .",
    "it might appear that the maximization of the two entropies @xmath93 in eq.([s[p|p ] ] ) and @xmath94 in eq.([sigma[p ] ] ) has lead to two different best approximations : one is @xmath47 with @xmath11 maximizing eq.([s[ptheta|p ] ] ) , and the other is @xmath95 in eq.(pbar ) .",
    "how can we have two different answers to the same question ?",
    "the answer is that we actually have two different questions .",
    "maximizing @xmath93 answers the question : what is the best single @xmath91 ? or , what is the best approximation obtainable in terms of a single trial ?  maximizing @xmath94 answers a different question : what is the best joint distribution @xmath63 ? or , equivalently , what is the best approximation when we are not restricted to a single trial ?",
    "this concludes the first part of our paper . to summarize : our main results consist in the justification of the relative entropy eq.([s[p|p ] ] ) as the uniquely natural functional to select the best approximations and the derivation of a quantitative measure of the degree to which the various trials are preferred , eq.([p(theta ) ] ) . the final result for the best approximation is eq.([pbar ] ) .",
    "next we illustrate how this abstract formalism is used in a specific example .",
    "here we collect some necessary background material on simple fluids .",
    "we consider a simple fluid composed of @xmath96 single atom molecules described by the hamiltonian @xmath97where @xmath98 and the many - body interactions are approximated by a pair interaction , @xmath99 where @xmath100 . the probability that the positions and momenta of the molecules lie within the phase space volume @xmath101 is given by canonical distribution , and @xmath102where @xmath103and @xmath104for fluids dominated by pair interactions most thermodynamic quantities of interest can be written in terms of the one- and two - particle density distributions @xmath105where @xmath106and @xmath107it is convenient to introduce the two - particle correlation function @xmath108which measures the extent to which the structure of liquids deviates from complete randomness . if the fluid is homogeneous and isotropic @xmath109 and @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the bulk density and @xmath112 is the radial distribution function ( rdf ) . then , the pressure is given by @xmath113where @xmath114 .",
    "@xcite - kalikmanov02    the difficulty , of course , is that it is very difficult to calculate @xmath112 from the `` exact '' distribution eq.([exact dist ] ) and we need to find an approximation that is calculable and still includes the two features of the interaction potential @xmath4 that are relevant for explaining most fluid properties : the strong repulsion at short distances and the weak attraction at long distances .    to account for the short - distance repulsion we consider a family of trials composed by distributions that describe a gas of hard spheres of diameter @xmath115 . for each @xmath116",

    "a third objection , and this is considerably more serious , is that the exact hard - sphere rdf is not known .",
    "however , it can be calculated within the approximation of percus and yevick ( py ) for which there exists an exact analytical solution ( @xcite , @xcite ) which is reasonably simple and in good agreement with numerical simulations over an extended range of temperatures and densities , except perhaps at high densities .",
    "there are several successful proposals @xcite to improve upon the py rdf but they also represent an additional level of complication .",

    "the distance between @xmath199 and @xmath116 is the same as the distance between @xmath200 and @xmath116 .",
    "we can then always choose @xmath201 and define @xmath202 in eq.([det g ] ) as the limit @xmath203 .",
    "then , using eq.(hs - free energy ) , we have @xmath204    to summarize , the distribution of diameters @xmath176 is given by eq.([pd(rd ) ] ) with @xmath146 given by eqs.([f_u ] , [ hs - free energy ] , [ f_u - lt ] ) and @xmath205 given by ( [ det g - exact ] ) .",

    "since the free energy @xmath146 is an extensive quantity , @xmath210 , for large @xmath96 the distribution @xmath211 is very sharply peaked at the optimal diameter @xmath148 .",
    "this result must be interpreted with care : when choosing a _ single _ optimal diameter for a macroscopic fluid sample we find that me confers overwhelming probability to the optimal value .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "the same thing happens when we calculate the global temperature or density of a macroscopic sample : standard textbook results predict that fluctuations about the expected value are utterly negligible . and yet fluctuations can be important .",
    "for example , for small fluid samples , or when we consider the local behavior of the fluid , fluctuations are not merely observable but can be large .",
    "local fluctuations can be appreciable while global fluctuations remain negligible .",
    "the question then , is whether these local fluctuations are relevant to the particular quantities we want to calculate .",
    "we argue that they are .",
    "the radial distribution function @xmath112 is the crucial quantity from which all other thermodynamic variables are computed .",
    "but from its very definition as the probability that given an atom at a certain place another atom will be found at a distance @xmath212 , it is clear that @xmath112 refers to purely local behavior and should be affected by local fluctuations . to the extent that the optimal @xmath148 depends on temperature and density we expect that local temperature and/or density fluctuations would induce local diameter fluctuations as well .",
    "the extended analysis in this section does not yet allow us to pursue the question of local diameter fluctuations in a satisfactory manner . as we mentioned earlier the me method",
    "is quite rigid in that the only freedom it allows is the choice of trial distributions .",
    "a proper analysis of diameter fluctuations would require enlarging the family of trial distributions to allow for spatial inhomogeneities in the diameters of the hard spheres .",
    "it may be worthwhile spelling out one possible such enlargement .",
    "we could imagine a trial model where the molecules are hard spheres with a diameter that depends on their location @xmath213 . as a molecule moves around its diameter shrinks and expands according to a prescribed function @xmath214 which thus acquires the character of an external `` field '' .",
    "to each possible choice of the diameter field @xmath213 there corresponds one trial distribution .",
    "this means that instead of a one - dimensional family of trials labelled by the single parameter @xmath116 we would have to deal with an infinite - dimensional family labeled by the fields @xmath213 .",
    "one should remark that these trial distributions do not describe any  physical system but this in itself is not a problem .",
    "the me method does not attempt to approximate one physical system by another physical , albeit idealized system ; it just attempts to approximate one mathematical distribution by another ; there is no requirement that the latter be interpretable in terms of physically realizable hamiltonians .",
    "the real problem , of course , is that these inhomogeneous trial models are not ( at present ) sufficiently tractable .",
    "however , we could divide the fluid into mesoscopic cells and consider trial models where the diameters @xmath215 are uniform within each cell @xmath216 , which allows a local percus - yevick approximation .",
    "the me method would then be applied to determine not only the distribution of diameters within each cell but also the optimal size of the cells .",
    "this is a development we plan to pursue in future work .    for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "however , we can quickly estimate the effects of local fluctuations by pointing out that the size of the region ( i.e. , the size of the cell ) that is locally relevant to the calculation of @xmath112 contains an effective number of atoms @xmath217 that can be estimated directly from a feature of the exact rdf that turns out to be known .",
    "( what we are doing is making the best use of information that happens to be available , which is quite in the spirit of our information theory - maximum entropy approach . )",
    "the basic idea is intuitively simple : at very short distances the form of the true , exact rdf  @xmath218 is dominated by the repulsive part of the potential . if the size of the molecule is given by the lennard - jones parameter @xmath94 , eq.([lj pot ] ) , the asymptotic form of @xmath112 is given by @xmath219 for a sufficiently dilute gas @xmath220 holds for all distances @xmath212 ; for dense fluids eq.(estimaterule ) is valid only for @xmath221 .",
    "( this follows from a clever trick due to percus which allows one to write an exact expression for the two - particle distribution function for a fluid in terms of the single particle density of the same fluid placed in a suitable external potential @xcite . )",
    "a fluid of hard spheres gives @xmath222 for @xmath223 and can not reproduce the behavior ( [ estimaterule ] ) .",
    "once we recognize that we can use a statistical mixture , eq.([pbar(q ) ] ) , we can tune the size @xmath217 of the cell and thereby change the width of @xmath224 so that the radial distribution function @xmath225 of ( [ ghs bar ] ) reproduces the known short - distance behavior .",
    "this we proceed to do in the next section .",
    "one of the difficulties in testing theories about fluids against experimental data is that it is not easy to see whether discrepancies are to be blamed to a faulty approximation or to a wrong intermolecular potential .",
