    "according to a decomposition of the space of the curvature tensors by natural action of an orthogonal group , the curvature tensor of a riemannian metric splits into a traceless ricci tensor , scalar curvature , and the weyl curvature tensor . as is well - known , the weyl tensor is invariant under conformal changes of the metric , and when the manifold is more than 3-dimensional , the metric is conformally flat if and only if the weyl tensor identically vanishes . when the manifold is 4-dimensional and oriented , since the lie algebra @xmath5 splits as @xmath6 , the bundle of 2-forms , which is exactly the bundle associated to the adjoint representation of @xmath7 , splits into two components , the self - dual and anti - self - dual parts .",
    "accordingly , the weyl curvature tensor splits into two parts .",
    "a riemannian metric on an oriented 4-manifold is said to be _ self - dual _ if the anti - self - dual part of the weyl tensor vanishes everywhere .",
    "self - dual metrics seem to have been paid special attentions because of its deep connection with complex geometry .",
    "namely , based on an idea by r. penrose , it is shown by atiyah , hitchin and singer @xcite that the total space of a projectified spin bundle over any oriented riemannian 4-manifold carries a natural almost complex structure , whose integrability condition is precisely the self - duality of the metric .",
    "thus any self - dual metric canonically produces a 3-dimensional complex manifold ; this is what is called the _ twistor space _ associated to a self - dual metric .",
    "while a considerable number of self - dual metrics and twistor spaces are known now , the most illuminating and tractable one still seems to be the lebrun metrics and their twistor spaces @xcite .",
    "the lebrun metrics are parameterized by a finite number of points ( called _ monopole points _ ) on the hyperbolic 3-space ; more precisely , the self - dual metrics are constructed on the total space of certain u(1)-bundle over the hyperbolic 3-space with @xmath8 monopole points removed , and this metric conformally extends to a compactification which is exactly @xmath9 .",
    "the two self - dual manifolds determined from two configurations of @xmath8 monopole points are conformally equivalent if and only if the configurations are equivalent under the usual psl@xmath10-action on the hyperbolic space .    by moving the monopole points on the hyperbolic space into extreme configurations , it is possible to consider various natural interesting limits of the lebrun metrics .",
    "when such a deformation ( to an extreme configuration ) is explicitly given , often it looks not so difficult to identify the limit self - dual structure , at least heuristically .",
    "however , it seems not obvious at all ( at least for the author ) what happens for the twistor spaces at the limit .",
    "a purpose of this paper is to give some explicit and rigorous answers to this question .    in section 2",
    ", we consider the case where one of the @xmath8 monopole points on the hyperbolic space goes to a point at the ideal boundary . in this case , the limit space is @xmath11 equipped with a lebrun metric . in particular , the topology of the 4-manifold changes . at the level of twistor spaces , we shall show the following .",
    "first if we take the corresponding natural limit for the twistor spaces on @xmath9 , then one obtains a 3-fold having one ordinary double point . in this degeneration",
    ", certain degree - one divisor ( and its conjugation ) breaks into two irreducible components , exactly one of which is @xmath12 .",
    "( so together with its conjugation , we have two @xmath12-s .",
    "the intersection of these is the double point . )",
    "if we take an appropriate small resolution for this ordinary double point , then the normal bundle of the two @xmath12-s becomes isomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "if we blow - down these , then we obtain a lebrun twistor space on @xmath11 .",
    "this is the main result in section 2 .",
    "we remark that our actual explanation is a bit different in that we mainly use _ projective models _ of the twistor spaces and not the twistor spaces themselves .",
    "( since the necessary operation for obtaining the twistor spaces from projective models are given by lebrun , this is not a serious matter . )",
    "the use of projective models is indispensable when taking a limit .    in section 3 ,",
    "differently from the limit in section 2 , we investigate the case where all the @xmath8 points on the hyperbolic space approach to a same point . in this case",
    "we show that the limit of the twistor space is the twistor space of lebrun s scalar - flat khler metric on the total space of the line bundle @xmath14 .",
    "the main body of the proof of this result is to find out all twistor lines in the limit space , to verify that the space is actually a twistor space , and we finally use a pontecorvo s result to a certain divisor and a lebrun s characterization result of the last metric , in order to identify the self - dual structure for the twistor space .    in section 4 , we consider another kind of limits .",
    "namely , instead of moving the monopole points , we fix these points and take rescaling to the hyperbolic space which makes the curvature zero . then in the limit the hyperbolic space becomes the flat euclidean space and the lebrun metric approaches to the gibbons - hawking s hyperkhler metric on a 4-manifold diffeomorphic to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a cyclic subgroup of su@xmath17 of order @xmath8 .",
    "note that the twistor spaces for the last metrics are explicitly constructed by hitchin @xcite . for any lebrun twistor space on @xmath9",
    ", we construct an explicit degenerating 1-dimensional family such that general fibers are zariski - open subsets of lebrun twistor spaces , and such that the limit fiber is the above twistor space of hitchin s .",
    "this completely agrees with the situation for the metrics which was obtained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) .",
    "finally we see that if we pull - back the above degenerating family by certain trivializing map outside the origin , then over the central fiber there appears the twistor space of the lebrun s scalar - flat khler metric on @xmath2 .",
    "we should mention what is happening for the base 4-manifolds for these degenerations . in the final section we give a brief discussion about convergence of the lebrun metrics , focusing on their khler representatives . for investigation on various limits of lebrun metrics from differential geometric point of view",
    ", we refer a recent paper by jeff viaclovsky @xcite",
    ".    * acknowledgement . *",
    "first of all , i would like to express my sincere gratitude to jeff viaclovsky for a number of helpful discussions about the material in this paper .",
    "certainly , without these discussions , i could not get any result in this paper .",
    "also i would like to thank claude lebrun for suggesting the use of minitwistor spaces for connecting his twistor spaces with hitchin s one .",
    "this suggestion was crucial for obtaining the result in section 4 .",
    "i also would like to thank the referees for a lot of kind and insightful suggestions , which yields section 5 .",
    "at this point i also would like to thank kazuo akutagawa for teaching materials on convergence of critical metrics on 4-manifolds , and kindly giving me a lot of suggestions .",
    "in this section we briefly recall lebrun s construction of his twistor spaces on @xmath0 @xcite . these are needed for giving our explicit construction of degenerations . put @xmath18 , equipped with the real structure @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are non - homogeneous coordinates on the two factors respectively . for each non - negative integer",
    "@xmath8 consider a rank-3 vector bundle over @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 then as @xmath24 interchanges the two factors , there is a natural anti - linear isomorphism between the line bundles @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this induces a real structure on the @xmath12-bundle @xmath27 , for which we still denote by @xmath24 .",
    "next we take any different @xmath8 points on the upper - half space @xmath28 and consider the lebrun metrics on @xmath0 determined from them .",
    "the twistor space of this metric is constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath29 be the @xmath30-curves on @xmath22 corresponding to the @xmath8 points .",
    "each of these curves are real and has no real point .",
    "so any two different @xmath31 and @xmath32 intersect transversally at two points . on the affine plane @xmath33",
    "on which the coordinates @xmath34 are valid , the curve @xmath31 is defined by the equation @xmath35 where by reality the coefficients satisfy @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then define an algebraic subvariety of @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we call @xmath42 _ the projective model of a lebrun twistor space on @xmath0_. @xmath42 has an obvious structure of a conic bundle over @xmath22 . as @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", there exists no discriminant curve other than @xmath31-s .",
    "the singular locus of @xmath42 is precisely over the intersection points of @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath45 and they are lying on the section @xmath46 . from the equation in , the conic bundle @xmath42 has distinguished , mutually conjugate two sections @xmath47 these are clearly away from the singular locus of @xmath42 .",
    "their normal bundles are @xmath48 and therefore @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be blown - down along one of the two projections @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be these blowing - down of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then the required lebrun twistor space is obtained from @xmath53 by taking appropriate small resolutions for the singularities over @xmath54 .    since any lebrun metric admits a u(1)-action",
    ", lebrun twistor spaces always admit a holomorphic @xmath55-action .",
    "it naturally induces a @xmath55-action on the projective model @xmath42 and in the above coordinates it is explicitly given by @xmath56      in this subsection we consider the case @xmath58 . in this case by normalizing the coordinates @xmath34 , we may suppose that the projective model @xmath42 is defined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 represents the conformal class of the metric .    from now on we investigate what happens when @xmath62 .",
    "namely we examine the variety @xmath63 ( the subscript @xmath64 reflects the fact that this limit corresponds to the situation that one of the two monopole points goes to infinity . )",
    "we name the two discriminant curves as @xmath65 of course , the reducible curve @xmath66 is a limit of the irreducible discriminant curve @xmath67 .",
    "the singularities of the curve @xmath68 consists of 3 points @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "correspondingly @xmath71 has 3 ordinary double points over there .",
    "the divisors @xmath49 and @xmath50 are still contained in @xmath71 and disjoint from these singularities , satisfying .",
    "we are going to show that the variety @xmath71 is explicitly birational to the flag twistor space of the fubini - study metric on @xmath12 along the following two steps :    \\(i ) choose appropriate small resolutions of all singularities of @xmath71 ,    \\(ii ) blow - down two redundant divisors into curves .",
    "figure [ fig-2_1 ] displays the inverse image of the discriminant curve @xmath68 . each face ( square ) represents an irreducible component of the inverse image of @xmath66 or @xmath72 , and the numbers attached to each edges represent the intersection number of the edge (= a rational curve ) in the component",
    ". the dotted points ( which are exactly the points where 4 faces meet ) are the ordinary double points of @xmath71 .",
    "further @xmath73 means the hirzebruch surface @xmath74 .",
    "then as the first step ( i ) we take small resolutions of the ordinary double points which transform the divisors in figure [ fig-2_1 ] into the situation displayed in figure [ fig-2_2 ] .",
    "the resulting 3-fold is non - singular . in this 3-fold , there remains exactly two divisors which are isomorphic to @xmath75 . since their normal bundles are degree @xmath76 along fibers as in figure [ fig-2_2 ] , they can be blown down in that direction .",
    "let @xmath77 be the resulting threefold .",
    "again @xmath77 is non - singular and has a conic bundle structure @xmath78 induced from that on @xmath71 .",
    "the discriminant locus of this is a single irreducible curve @xmath72 .",
    "namely , both of the two irreducible components of @xmath66 are _ not _ discriminant curve any more .",
    "thus our modification ( especially the blow - down step ( ii ) ) has an effect of _ removing the reducible curve @xmath66 from the discriminant locus .",

    "( the left and right vertical edges are identified . ) ]    on the other hand , since lebrun metric on @xmath12 is nothing but the fubini - study metric , the flag twistor space @xmath81 can be obtained from the ` projective model ' @xmath82 by blowing down two sections @xmath49 and @xmath50 . obviously the two conic bundles @xmath78 and @xmath83 have the same discriminant locus @xmath84 .",
    "more strongly , we have    [ thm-2 ] @xmath77 and @xmath85 are biholomorphic .",
    "this implies that one can obtain the flag twistor space on @xmath12 from a lebrun twistor space on @xmath86 by first taking a limit ( @xmath62 ) and then blowing down redundant divisors .",
    "we postpone a proof of theorem [ thm-2 ] until next subsection in which we prove a theorem which contains theorem [ thm-2 ] as a special case .      in this section",
    "we generalize the construction in the previous subsection to the case of @xmath0 and prove that lebrun twistor spaces on @xmath1 can be obtained from those on @xmath0 by first taking a limit and then applying some birational transformations .",
    "suppose @xmath87 .",
    "we keep notation in the last subsection .",
    "first we take appropriate coordinates on @xmath88 to normalize defining equation as @xmath89 ( we can further suppose @xmath90 , but we do not assume this because the curve @xmath91 does not play a particular role . ) without loss of generality we can suppose that if @xmath92 the curves @xmath93 and @xmath94 do not intersect on @xmath95 . if we put @xmath96 , we obtain a variety @xmath97 then again all singularities of @xmath71 are over singular points of the discriminant curves @xmath98 and they are also lying on the section @xmath46 . generically",
    "all of them are ordinary double points .",
    "( but we do not suppose it . ) in figure [ fig - n_0 ] the discriminant locus is illustrated , in the case @xmath99 .     for the case @xmath99 .",
    "]    as in the case @xmath58 , we consider the inverse image of the reducible curve @xmath95 . the inverse image of an irreducible component @xmath100 consists of two non - singular divisors , which are biholomorphic to @xmath75 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "the situation is similar to the curve @xmath102 , although the place of @xmath75 and @xmath101 are upside down as illustrated in figure [ fig - n_1 ] .",
    "thus there are exactly two @xmath75-s in the inverse image of the curve @xmath95 .",
    "on each of these two @xmath75-s there are precisely @xmath8 ordinary double points of @xmath71 .",
    "exactly one of these points are shared by the two @xmath75-s .",
    "this point is over the point @xmath103 . in figure [ fig - n_1 ] these @xmath104 singularities are displayed as dotted points .",
    "( the last ordinary point is at the center . )",
    "the vertical broken lines represent the intersection with the inverse image of the discriminant curve @xmath105 .",
    "then as the first step of the present modification , we resolve all these @xmath104 ordinary double points by small resolutions which are uniquely determined by the rule that _ the two @xmath75-s are always unchanged_. similarly to the case @xmath58 , we denote the resulting space by @xmath53 .",
    "there are still other double points of @xmath53 over the intersections of @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath106 .",
    "( these double points did not appear in the case @xmath58 . )",
    "we do not touch these singularities . in @xmath53 , the inverse image of the curve @xmath95",
    "is as illustrated in figure [ fig - n_2 ] .",
    "in particular @xmath53 is non - singular in a neighborhood of these divisors .",
    "further as in the figure the normal bundles of the two @xmath75-s in @xmath53 is degree @xmath76 along fibers of @xmath107 . therefore these two divisors can be blown - down .",
    "let @xmath108 be this blowing down .",
    "this is the second step of the present modification . in this way starting from a lebrun twistor space on @xmath0 we obtained a new space @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 be the projection naturally induced from the conic bundle projection @xmath79 .",
    "then as in the case @xmath58 , the curve @xmath95 is _ not _ a discriminant curve of @xmath111 .     under @xmath79 ]     under @xmath113 ( i.e.strict transforms of the divisors in figure [ fig - n_1 ] ) . ]     under @xmath114 ( and @xmath115 ) .",
    "( i.e.transformations of the divisors in figure [ fig - n_2 ] . ) ]    then we have the following    [ thm-3 ] the above constructed threefold @xmath109 is biholomorphic to the projective model ( see ( 2.1 ) ) of the lebrun twistor space on @xmath1 defined by @xmath116    recall that the original conic bundle @xmath79 has two distinguished sections @xmath49 and @xmath117 , and the birational transformations from @xmath71 to @xmath109 do not contract these sections .",
    "so the projection @xmath110 still has two distinguished sections , still denoted by @xmath49 and @xmath50 . as explained in the preceding paragraph of theorem [ thm-3 ] ,",
    "@xmath109 has double points which are over @xmath118 for @xmath106 .",
    "these are lying on the section @xmath46 and hence disjoint from @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we take any small resolutions of all these double points of @xmath109 to obtain a non - singular threefold @xmath119 .",
    "then as the curve @xmath95 is not a discriminant curve for @xmath111 , the discriminant locus of the composition @xmath120 is the curve @xmath121 .",
    "any fiber over the discriminant locus is a chain of smooth rational curves .",
    "since the small resolution @xmath122 does not touch , @xmath123 still has distinguished sections @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "as one can read off from figure [ fig - n_3 ] ( the upper horizontal line is the intersection with @xmath49 ( or @xmath117 ) , and the lower one is the intersection with @xmath117 ( or @xmath124 ) ) , their normal bundles in @xmath125 ( or in @xmath109 ) are given by @xmath126 hence considering an exact sequence @xmath127 taking a direct image by @xmath123 , noting @xmath128 ( as all fibers of @xmath123 is a chain of smooth rational curves ) , and computing ext@xmath129 for this sequence , we obtain an isomorphism @xmath130 in particular , the direct image @xmath131 is isomorphic to the dual bundle @xmath132 , in which the projective model of a lebrun twistor space on @xmath1 is embedded . by the morphism @xmath133 and the line bundle @xmath134",
    "we obtain a rational map @xmath135 over @xmath22 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath136 to a fiber @xmath137 is precisely the rational map associated to the linear system of the restricted line bundle @xmath138 .",
    "it follows that @xmath139 is an embedding if @xmath140 .",
    "further @xmath136 contracts the exceptional curves of the small resolution @xmath122 since @xmath49 and @xmath50 are disjoint from the exceptional curves .",
    "this means that @xmath136 induces an isomorphism from @xmath109 to @xmath141 .",
    "namely the variety @xmath109 can be embedded in @xmath142 as a conic sub - bundle .",
    "it is obvious that the discriminant locus of the projection @xmath143 is still the curve @xmath121 and the inverse image of its irreducible component @xmath93 @xmath144 ) consists of two irreducible components .",
    "this is the same for the projective model . using this fact and the @xmath55-action",
    "we now show that @xmath145 is biholomorphic to the threefold .",
    "since the two sections @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath71 are fixed by the @xmath55-action , and the birational transformations from @xmath71 to @xmath125 clearly preserve this action , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are still fixed under the natural @xmath55-action on @xmath125 .",
    "hence the sequence is @xmath55-equivariant and the morphism @xmath146 is @xmath55-equivariant . if we note that the @xmath55-action on @xmath147 and @xmath148 are given by scalar multiplications of @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively for @xmath151 , it follows that naturally induced @xmath55-action on @xmath152 is given by @xmath153 .",
    "hence since the image @xmath154 is @xmath55-invariant , the equation of @xmath141 must be of the form @xmath155 for some @xmath156 .",
    "( the coefficients of the lhs must be constant by equi - dimensionality of @xmath114 . )",
    "then since the discriminant locus of @xmath114 is @xmath157 we obtain @xmath158 for some @xmath159 .",
    "finally , by reality , we obtain @xmath160 and hence by normalizing the coordinate @xmath161 , we can suppose @xmath162 .",
    "thus we have seen that a defining equation of @xmath109 in @xmath142 is the same as .",
    "hence @xmath109 is isomorphic to .",
    "the series of operations above starts from a _ projective model _ of lebrun twistor space , and also ends at a projective model . in order to obtain operations starting and finishing in the twistor spaces themselves , we just need to recall ( * ? ? ?",

    "that is to say , it is enough to attach these operations beforehand and afterward .",
    "however , once we can identify the output space @xmath109 ( as we did in theorem [ thm-3 ] ) , it is possible to restate our construction without passing to projective models as follows :    1 .",
    "let @xmath163 be any lebrun twistor space , and @xmath164 the rational map associated to the fundamental system @xmath165 .",
    "the image @xmath166 is a non - singular quadric @xmath22 , and for any discriminant curve @xmath167 , the inverse image @xmath168 consists of two irreducible components @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",

    "( in order to justify this process rigorously , we need the projective models as we discussed . )",
    "let @xmath172 be the limit variety . then in @xmath172 each of @xmath169 and @xmath170 breaks into two irreducible components . among these two components ,",
    "exactly one is biholomorphic to @xmath12 .",
    "so over the reducible curve @xmath66 we have two @xmath12-s .",
    "the intersection of these @xmath12-s is a ( real ) ordinary double point of @xmath172 .",
    "we take the small resolution of this ordinary double point which does not change the structure of the two @xmath12-s .",
    "( this condition uniquely specifies the small resolution . )",
    "then the normal bundle of these becomes isomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "4 .   so we blow - down the two @xmath12-s . then the resulting space is nothing but the lebrun twistor space on @xmath11 , whose projective model is exactly the variety @xmath109 in theorem [ thm-3 ] .    a proof of these can be readily obtained if we notice that in each steps in the former construction that uses the projective models , the two divisors @xmath49 and @xmath117 are always contained in such a way that they can be blown - down to @xmath3 , as one can read off from figures [ fig - n_1][fig - n_3 ] .",
    "so we omit the proof .    _ the result in this section gives a way to obtain a lebrun twistor on @xmath1 from that on @xmath0 .",

    "they intersect in such a way that any two different @xmath75-s shares a unique point , and the same for any two different @xmath101-s .",
    "( these are ordinary double points of the limit 3-fold . )",
    "hence we can choose a small resolution of these ordinary double points which does not change @xmath75 .",
    "consequently we are again in the situation that these @xmath181 @xmath75-s can be blown - down to @xmath3 , which gives a projective model of lebrun twistor space on @xmath173 . _",
    "in ( * ? ? ? * section 5 ) lebrun showed by direct calculations for metrics that if the monopole points @xmath182 on @xmath28 converge to a single point , then after a suitable conformal change , the metrics converge to the scalar - flat khler metric on the total space of the line bundle @xmath183 constructed also by lebrun @xcite . in this section",
    "we prove that if all @xmath8 polynomials @xmath184 ( corresponding to the monopole points ) are equal , then the variety obtained from the space @xmath42 defined in by blowing - down the divisors @xmath49 and @xmath50 is ( a compactification of ) the twistor space of the lebrun metric on @xmath2 .",
    "we show this by first finding all twistor lines explicitly , and then use a result by pontecorvo @xcite and a characterization of the lebrun metric showed in @xcite .    in order to reduce complexity in computation , we use slightly different coordinates on @xmath185 from section 2 . namely we adapt non - homogenous coordinates @xmath34 on @xmath185 with respect to which the real structure is given by @xmath186 , and the unique polynomial becomes @xmath187 .",

    "let @xmath203 be the blowing - down .",
    "since @xmath200 is disjoint from @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath200 is naturally contained in @xmath204 .",

    ". then we have the following    [ thm-4 ] the complement @xmath205 has a structure of the twistor space of a scalar flat khler metric on the total space of @xmath206 .",
    "we prove the claim by finding all twistor lines in explicit form .",
    "it is elementary to deduce that any smooth @xmath30-curve contained in @xmath207 which is invariant under the real structure on @xmath22 must be of the form , in the above coordinate @xmath34 , @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a coordinate on the curve , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are constants with @xmath212 and @xmath213 when @xmath214 ,   means @xmath215 .",
    "we denote the curve by @xmath216 .",
    "when @xmath217 , from we compute @xmath218 therefore the restriction of the conic bundle @xmath219 onto @xmath216 is explicitly given by the equation @xmath220 where , we are working on the affine set @xmath221 and writing @xmath222 and @xmath223 . viewing as an equation for @xmath224 with @xmath225 and @xmath226 being rational functions of @xmath227 , has solutions @xmath228 where @xmath229 is arbitrary constant .",
    "note that since @xmath213 , the square root of @xmath230 has a unique meaning ; namely we choose a positive one .",
    "let @xmath231 be the real curve .",
    "thanks to @xmath229 , this curve is invariant under the real structure . similarly ,",
    "when @xmath214 , if we define the curve @xmath232 over @xmath233 by @xmath234 then @xmath235 is real and contained in @xmath191 . from the explicit forms , all these curves @xmath231 , @xmath236 , are disjoint from the curve @xmath200 .",
    "thus we obtain a 4-dimensional family @xmath237 of real curves in @xmath191 .",
    "we now prove the claim that _ the complement @xmath238 is foliated by members of @xmath239_. namely we show that for any point of this set there exists a unique member of @xmath239 going through the point .",
    "we prove this by taking arbitrary point of @xmath207 and verify that the claim holds for any point of the fiber over there , as long as the point is not on @xmath240 .",
    "we begin with the easiest case .",
    "take @xmath241 .",
    "its fiber is @xmath242 , a union of two lines .",

    "this implies that any point of the fiber , except the 3 points @xmath252 and @xmath253 , is passed by a unique member of @xmath239 ( of the form @xmath244 if @xmath254 and @xmath235 if @xmath255 ) .",
    "thus we obtain the claim , for the fiber over @xmath256 .",
    "next we choose a point @xmath257 .",
    "this assumption implies @xmath258 .",

    ". then we readily obtain @xmath263 and , from we get @xmath264 solving this with respect to @xmath265 we obtain @xmath266 since this is a real number , we obtain @xmath267 this is equivalent to @xmath268 and hence we obtain @xmath269 .",
    "so we put @xmath270 .",
    "then we have @xmath271 from this we obtain that being @xmath272 is equivalent to @xmath273 .",

    "first , we note that holomorphic automorphisms of @xmath22 commuting with the real structure and preserving the discriminant locus @xmath284 must be of the form @xmath285 where @xmath286 with @xmath287 , which constitute an su(2)-action .",
    "it can be shown by direct computations that this action lifts on the line bundles @xmath288 , @xmath26 and @xmath289 in such a way that it preserves the variety @xmath191 , and it commutes with the real structure .",
    "( we do not write the explicit form . )",
    "the su(2)-action on @xmath191 thus obtained maps members of @xmath239 to those of @xmath239 .",

    "these implies that if some two different members of @xmath239 intersect on the fiber over @xmath34 , then there must be a pair of members of @xmath239 intersecting on the fiber over @xmath293 .",
    "this contradicts what we have verified for the fibers over the point @xmath259 , @xmath294 . by similar reasoning ( using the automorphism )",
    ", we obtain that for any point on the fiber over arbitrary point @xmath295 , there exists a member of @xmath239 going through the point .",
    "thus we have obtained that the family @xmath239 actually foliates the set . in the following @xmath239",
    "means the set of image curves under the blowing - down @xmath203 .    on the other hand , for any point of @xmath296",
    "its fiber is obviously real .",
    "( recall that @xmath24 has no real point . )",
    "let @xmath297 be the set of these real fibers of @xmath111 .",
    "taking the images under @xmath298 , we obtain a set of real curves in @xmath204 parameterized by @xmath296 .",
    "we still write @xmath297 for this family .",
    "thus we have obtained two families @xmath239 and @xmath297 of real smooth rational curves in @xmath204 . from the construction the union @xmath299 foliates @xmath205 , where any point on the curves @xmath300 and @xmath301 is passed by a unique member of @xmath297 . in order to show that @xmath205 actually has a structure of a twistor space it remains to see that the normal bundles of these curves are all isomorphic to @xmath302 .",
    "this is immediate to see for members of @xmath297 . on the other hand",
    "any member of @xmath239 is an image of some @xmath303 in @xmath191 . by construction",
    "@xmath304 holds .",
    "further it is easily seen that the surface @xmath305 has @xmath4-singularities over the intersection points @xmath306 and is smooth outside these 2 points . in particular , as @xmath307 , the surface is smooth in a neighborhood of @xmath308 .",
    "then since @xmath308 can actually be moved ( by changing @xmath309 ) in such a way that it is disjoint from @xmath308 , the normal bundle of @xmath308 in @xmath310 is trivial .",
    "it follows from the two inclusions @xmath311 that the normal bundle of @xmath308 in @xmath191 is either @xmath302 or @xmath312 .",
    "we show that the latter can not happen .",
    "as the normal bundle is @xmath302 or @xmath313 , whose @xmath314-s are zero , the moduli space of all small deformations of @xmath308 in @xmath191 is non - singular complex 4-manifold and its tangent space at the point ( corresponding to @xmath308 ) is naturally isomorphic to @xmath315 , where @xmath316 is the normal bundle . because @xmath239 is a real 4-dimensional family , it must be a real slice of the moduli space . if @xmath316 is isomorphic to @xmath313",
    ", then there is a real section @xmath317 such that its zeros consist of distinct 2 points .",
    "further , since the surface @xmath310 is real in @xmath191 , the section @xmath317 can be supposed to be real .",
    "let @xmath318 and @xmath319 be the zeros of such an @xmath149 . then @xmath149 generates a complex 1-dimensional deformation of @xmath308 in @xmath191 such that all members go through @xmath318 and @xmath320 .",
    "further , by reality of @xmath149 , this deformation contains a real 1-dimensional subfamily whose members are real .",
    "this contradicts the fact that any two different members of the family @xmath239 are disjoint .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath321 .",
    "then since @xmath298 is isomorphic outside @xmath322 , the normal bundle of @xmath323 in @xmath204 remains to be @xmath302 .",
    "thus we obtain that @xmath205 is foliated by real smooth rational curves without real point whose normal bundles are isomorphic to @xmath302 .",
    "next we see that the parameter space of these twistor lines is diffeomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "as is already mentioned the inverse image @xmath196 consists of two divisors @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "these are clearly biholomorphic to a ruled surface @xmath324 , and their intersection @xmath200 is a section of the ruling whose self - intersection is @xmath325 . thus both of the connected component of @xmath326 is biholomorphic to the total space of @xmath2 .",
    "further it follows from our concrete description that the twistor lines we have detected intersect each of the connected components of @xmath326 at a unique point .",
    "hence the parameter space of the twistor lines , namely the base 4-manifold , has to be diffeomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "finally we have to show that the self - dual conformal structure on @xmath2 is represented by a scalar - flat khler metric ( after reversing the orientation ) . by adjunction formula and the inclusion @xmath327",
    "we readily obtain , outside the singular locus @xmath200 , that @xmath328 . from this",
    "we obtain @xmath329 on @xmath330 .",
    "as @xmath284 is a @xmath30-curve , this means @xmath331 .",
    "therefore by a theorem of pontecorvo @xcite , the conformal class is represented by a scalar - flat khler metric ( on @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus we have completed a proof of theorem [ thm-4 ] .    with the aid of the characterization result by lebrun @xcite we obtain the following    [ thm : o(-n ) ] @xmath205 is the twistor space of lebrun s asymptotically flat , scalar flat khler metric on @xmath2 constructed in @xcite .    by pulling back the metric obtained in theorem [ thm-4 ] under the usual @xmath8-fold covering @xmath332",

    "let @xmath334 be the twistor space of this metric , and @xmath335 the natural @xmath8-fold covering .",

    "further , since @xmath346 and @xmath340 and @xmath341 are precisely the image of @xmath343 and @xmath344 under the quotient map by @xmath347-action which fixes @xmath345 , the normal bundles of @xmath345 in @xmath343 and @xmath344 have to be @xmath348 .",
    "therefore , the normal bundles of @xmath345 in @xmath349 are isomorphic to @xmath302 .",
    "therefore the 3-fold @xmath349 is a twistor space of a 4-manifold @xmath350 , where @xmath351 is the point corresponding to @xmath345 .    since the divisor @xmath352 outside @xmath200",
    ", we have @xmath353 . therefore by the proof of proposition 6 in @xcite , the conformal class on @xmath354 determined by the twistor space @xmath334 is represented by an _ asymptotically flat _ , scalar flat khler metric .",
    "hence we have shown that the scalar - flat khler metric in theorem [ thm-4 ] is locally asymptotically flat .",
    "on the other hand as seen in the proof of theorem [ thm-4 ] , the space @xmath334 admits an effective su(2)-action commuting with the real structure .",
    "hence the metric admits an effective su(2)-action .",
    "therefore by characterization result of lebrun ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , proposition ) the metric must be lebrun s metric , as desired .",
    "in @xcite , gibbons - hawking explicitly constructed a family of hyperkhler metrics on complex surfaces which are diffeomorphic to the minimal resolution of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a cyclic subgroup of su(2 ) of any finite order . in @xcite , hitchin constructed the twistor spaces of these metrics . in this section",
    "we show that these twistor spaces can be obtained as a limit of a zariski open subset of lebrun s twistor spaces on @xmath0 , where @xmath8 is exactly the order of the cyclic subgroup @xmath16 .",
    "we begin by quickly recalling the hitchin s construction .",

    "let @xmath359 be a 3-dimensional algebraic variety defined by @xmath360 where @xmath361 , @xmath362 . by using the projection to @xmath363 , we regard the variety @xmath359 as a conic bundle over the total space of @xmath363 , where the conics are in @xmath364",
    ". then the discriminant curves of the conic bundle are exactly the sections @xmath365 .",
    "therefore , the variety @xmath359 has singularity precisely over the intersection points of these sections .",
    "moreover , by the reality condition for the coefficients of @xmath366 , any two different sections intersect transversally at ( mutually conjugate ) two points .",
    "this means that all the singularities of @xmath359 admit a small resolution .",
    "furthermore , @xmath359 has a real structure naturally induced from the anti - podal map on @xmath3 .",
    "then the desired twistor space of the gibbons - hawking metric is obtained as an appropriate small resolution of @xmath359 , equipped with a natural lift of the real structure .    for giving a precise relationship between these twistor spaces with lebrun s ones , it is convenient to think the total space of the above line bundle @xmath363 as a degeneration of @xmath88 , which is the minitwistor space of the hyperbolic space @xmath28 .",
    "more explicitly , we define a subvariety @xmath367 by @xmath368 we also define a real structure on @xmath369 by @xmath370 let @xmath371 be the projection to the last factor . if we view this as a family of quadrics in @xmath372 parameterized by @xmath373 , then a fiber @xmath374 is non - singular when @xmath375 , and a cone over a conic @xmath376 with vertex @xmath377 when @xmath378 .",

    "in particular , the cone @xmath382 itself is real , and we remark that on the conic @xmath383 , the real structure is naturally acting as an anti - podal map since there is no real point on the conic .",
    "therefore , the real locus on @xmath382 is the vertex only . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath384 , then the real locus on @xmath380 is a ( non - holomorphic ) 2-sphere .",
    "if @xmath149 tends to zero , this sphere shrinks to the vertex .",
    "as is well - known , the family @xmath371 can be trivialized outside the origin . actually , by rewriting the defining equation of @xmath369 as @xmath385 we can take the trivializing map @xmath386 by @xmath387 next we give two ( non - cartier ) divisors on the variety @xmath369 by @xmath388 @xmath389 then clearly these are contained in @xmath369 , and for any @xmath373 , the intersections @xmath390 and @xmath391 are lines in @xmath372 .",

    "so we can put @xmath471 . on the other hand ,",
    "the plane @xmath472 is defined by @xmath473 with @xmath474 and @xmath475 . dividing the equation by @xmath476 , noting that @xmath477 can be used as a fiber coordinate on @xmath363 , and also the relation @xmath478 valid on the cone",
    ", we obtain the equation @xmath479 .",
    "this means @xmath480 therefore we obtained the required relations for the coefficients , and the defining equation of @xmath382 is written exactly in the form .",
    "hence we obtain ( iii ) .",
    "finally , by the choice of our real structure on the bundle @xmath442 , on @xmath445 with @xmath384 , it agrees with that on @xmath481 explained in the beginning of section 2 .",
    "this means that the isomorphisms in ( i ) and ( ii ) preserve the real structure . by a similar reason",
    ", the real structures also agree on the central fiber @xmath204 , meaning ( iv ) .    from the proof , the zariski open subset of the projective model @xmath42 to which @xmath445 @xmath482 and @xmath483 is biholomorphic , is exactly the subset @xmath484 in the notation of section 2 , the complement of the set in @xmath42 is exactly the two divisors @xmath49 and @xmath117 .",
    "recalling that in the construction of the lebrun twistor space , @xmath49 and @xmath117 are blown - down to @xmath485 .",
    "these curves clearly form a conjugate pair , so we denote them by @xmath486 and @xmath487",
    ". then with respect to the twistor fibration to @xmath0 , @xmath486 and @xmath487 are exactly over the 2-sphere fixed by the semi - free u(1)-action on @xmath0 .",
    "thus by taking a small resolution of double points into account , it is possible to say that _ the complement of @xmath488 in the lebrun twistor spaces on @xmath0 can be deformed to the hitchin s twistor space of the minimal resolution of @xmath15 . _",
    "if @xmath489 denotes the twistor fibration map , then we can alternatively say that _ the non - zariski open subset @xmath490 can be deformed to the hitchin s twistor space .",
    "_ this means that the non - holomorphic submanifold @xmath491 ( which are union of twistor lines parameterized by @xmath492 ) shrinks to the single twistor line over the orbifold point .",
    "in particular , a non - holomorphic submanifold shrinks to a holomorphic submanifold . on the other hand , since the locus @xmath493 is canonically identified with the boundary of @xmath28 , from the metric viewpoint ,",
    "this is entirely reasonable .    for explaining what happens for the metrics in this degeneration",
    ", we first recall that if @xmath384 and @xmath446 , the base space @xmath494 of the conic bundle @xmath495 ( the restriction of @xmath496 ) is exactly the minitwistor space of the upper - half space @xmath28 ( regarded as an einstein - weyl space ) . by lemma [ lemma : hi ] , the space @xmath28 is identified with the ellipsoid @xmath497 then clearly we have @xmath498 . on the other hand , when we defined the family @xmath499 , we had _ fixed _ the @xmath8 planes @xmath415 .",
    "let @xmath182 be the corresponding monopole points respectively .",
    "these @xmath8 points naturally belong to the ellipsoid @xmath500 . further ,",
    "as the right - hand side of the equation in is independent of @xmath149 , these @xmath8 points in @xmath500 do not move .",
    "thus we have seen that _",
    "when @xmath149 goes to zero , while the einstein - weyl space @xmath500 tends to the euclidean space @xmath501 , the monopole points stay fixed_.    next we show that _ if we pull - back the family @xmath496 to @xmath502 by the trivializing map @xmath290 ( see ) , then on the central fiber there appears the twistor space of the lebrun metric on @xmath2_. for this , if we put @xmath503 and @xmath504 , then by a simple computation , on the quadric @xmath380 @xmath505 , we have @xmath506 on the other hand , by lemma [ lemma : hi ] , the plane @xmath472 is defined by the equation with the coefficients @xmath507 replaced by @xmath508 , where @xmath509 satisfies the inequality . substituting to the equation of @xmath472 , we get @xmath510 let @xmath511 be the left - hand side of .",
    "then @xmath512 is a defining equation of the divisor @xmath513 in @xmath514 .",
    "therefore , the pull - back family @xmath515 is given by the equation @xmath516 where @xmath40 by lemma [ lemma : rest4 ] as before .",
    "then by , the defining equation of the inverse image of @xmath517 ( under the projection @xmath518 ) is given by @xmath519 by theorem [ thm : o(-n ) ] , this is exactly the defining equation of ( a zariski open subset of ) the twistor space of the lebrun metric on @xmath2 , as required .",
    "if one wants not a subset but the entire twistor space , it is enough to compactify the fibers of the family @xmath520 by considering the projective bundle @xmath521 instead of @xmath442 , and pull it back by @xmath290 .",
    "so far we have studied degenerations of twistor spaces .",
    "but originally these are of course motivated by understanding degenerations of ( anti)-self - dual metrics or conformal classes on the 4-manifolds . in this final section",
    "we briefly discuss what happens for base 4-manifolds , by picking up khler representatives of the conformal classes on ( dense ) open subsets of the 4-manifolds .",
    "for a thorough investigation in this direction , we refer a paper by viaclovsky @xcite .",
    "we recall that lebrun @xcite first constructs a scalar - flat khler metric on a collinear blow - up of @xmath364 explicitly , and then verifies that the metric can be extended to a one point compactification after adjusting a conformal gauge . here for avoiding confusion we call these scalar flat khler metrics as lebrun _",
    "metrics_.    as showed by tian - viaclovsky ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , any sequence of complete khler metrics with constant scalar curvature on a 4-manifold satisfying some boundedness condition on the curvature tensor and sobolev constants has a converging subsequence with the limit being a khler orbifold , where the convergence is in the gromov - hausdorff sense as _ pointed _ spaces .",
    "for avoiding confusion with monopole centers , we refer the point of pointed spaces as a _ base point_.    let @xmath522 be a sequence of @xmath8 points on the hyperbolic space , and @xmath523 the sequence of the lebrun metrics which have these @xmath8 points as the set of monopole points .",
    "first as in section 2 we consider the situation that the first point @xmath524 goes to infinity as @xmath525 while the remaining @xmath526 points stay fixed",
    ". then if we take a compact domain @xmath527 and if we choose as a base point a point @xmath528 which belongs to the subset over @xmath529 , then since the green function centered at @xmath524 tends to zero as @xmath525 on the @xmath530-ball centered at @xmath528 for any @xmath531 , the space with lebrun metric @xmath532 converges to the space equipped with the lebrun metric having the fixed @xmath526 points as the set of monopole points .",
    "the degeneration from @xmath9 to @xmath11 constructed in section 2 is the twistor translation of this degeneration .",
    "next consider the same sequence of @xmath8 points as in the previous paragraph but this time as base points we choose the moving point @xmath524 , viewed as a point on @xmath9 .",
    "then since the distance between the fixed @xmath526 points and the base point goes to infinity as @xmath525 , the limit as pointed space should be the space equipped with the lebrun metric with one monopole point ; namely the burns metric .",
    "this is rather the space which disappeared in the last degeneration , and thus changing a base point can give a different limit .    also it is natural to expect that in the degeneration of the twistor spaces constructed in section 2 , at the limit ( central fiber ) , we find not only a twistor space of @xmath11 but also the twistor space of fubini - study metric ( which is a conformal compactification of the burns metric ) .",
    "however , even if we regard our degeneration as a family @xmath533 and try to perform the birational transformations within the 4-fold @xmath434 , i could not find the flag twistor space at the central fiber .",
    "we note that the existence of such a model is guaranteed by the framework of donaldson - friedman @xcite .",
    "if one can find the flag twistor space at the central fiber of the family , it provides an explicit realization of the donaldson - friedman model for the case of the present degeneration , not relying on deformation theory of complex spaces .",
    "next in accordance with the degeneration taken up in section 3 we consider the sequence @xmath522 of @xmath8 points for which all @xmath534-s approach to a point @xmath535 as @xmath525 . in this case",
    ", as was explicitly shown in coordinates by lebrun @xcite , the limit is a space equipped with the lebrun s scalar flat khler metric on @xmath2 .",
    "however we note that we have to choose a conformal gauge which is different from the above lebrun metrics on the collinear blowup of @xmath364 ; instead another khler representative found in @xcite has to be chosen to get the above limit .",
    "as was discovered in @xcite , if we look at this degeneration more carefully , it provides a typical example of bubbling off phenomena of ale spaces .",
    "namely , when all the monopole points @xmath536 of lebrun metrics become closer to a point @xmath537 in such a way that their angular positions relative to @xmath318 as well as the ratio of the distances from @xmath318 are preserved , around the point @xmath318 we make a sequence of rescalings in a way that the distances from @xmath318 become constant .",
    "then at the limit the curvature of the hyperbolic space becomes zero and as a result a gibbons - hawking space with @xmath8 monopole points on @xmath501 bubble off from the point @xmath318 .    to understand this bubble off through our degeneration of the twistor spaces constructed in section 4 , for each @xmath381 with @xmath538",
    ", we define a dilation @xmath539 by @xmath540 for @xmath541 . then for the ellipsoids we have @xmath542 . hence pulling back by @xmath543",
    ", @xmath500 becomes @xmath544 and the point @xmath545 is pulled back to @xmath546 .",
    "thus by letting @xmath547 , all the monopole points become closer to the origin , while their relative position is exactly as explained in the last paragraph .",
    "finally it seems natural to expect that , when any sequence @xmath522 of @xmath8 points is given , possible limits ( as pointed spaces ) of the associated lebrun metrics , implied by the above tian - viaclovsky s convergence theorem , are lebrun orbifolds with @xmath175 ( @xmath548 ) monopole points , where the lebrun orbifold metric means a natural generalization of the lebrun metrics , allowing some of the monopole points to coincide ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2 ) for the precise definition ) . then it would be possible to say that the degenerations considered in sections 2 and 3 are two extremal cases among these degenerations .",
