    "the classical two - phase stefan problem models the evolution of temperature in a material with two distinct phases ( solid and liquid ) .",
    "the solid - liquid phase transition occurs at a given constant temperature , which we set at zero .",
    "the problem is described by an _",
    "_ function @xmath0 , which represents the internal energy density in each phases ( see meirmanov @xcite and oleinik et al .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 be a bounded domain in @xmath2 with a @xmath3 boundary .",
    "then @xmath4 solves the following problem : @xmath5 in this paper we will set @xmath6 as a continuous function on @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 as a bounded measurable function with @xmath9 continuous on @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 on @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 describes the evolving temperature , where @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15    note that @xmath0 is determined by @xmath16 almost everywhere if @xmath17 is of measure zero , but not in general .",
    "the interior of zero temperature set @xmath18 , if exits , is called a _",
    "mushy region_. it is well known that mushy region might appear in a stefan problem with heat sources , see bertsch et al .",
    "when there is no heat source , the mushy region can only be generated from the initial data . indeed if @xmath19 ( here @xmath20 denotes the lebesgue measure in @xmath21 ) , it is shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and can be written in terms of the temperature : @xmath24 here @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes respectively the limit taken from @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the outward normal velocity of the free boundary with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath30 with no heat source then the mushy region is non - increasing as the solution evolves ( see @xcite ) : in this case the zero temperature set @xmath18 may exhibit instability such as infinite speed of propagation as its interior diminishes ( see @xcite where the interface evolution is investigated in the case of one - phase hele - shaw flow with initial mushy region ) .",
    "for both and , even solutions with initially smooth configuration may develop singularities in finite time , due to merging and splitting of the liquid - solid regions .",
    "thus it is necessary to introduce a generalized notion of global - in - time solutions .",
    "the first global notion of solutions for has been derived by a weak formulation via integration by parts : see ladyenskaja et .",
    "@xcite or friedman @xcite .",
    "this approach allows the presence of initial mushy region .",
    "it was shown there that a unique weak solution exists for bounded measurable @xmath8 and @xmath31 .",
    "moreover the temperature @xmath32 turns out to be continuous when @xmath8 and @xmath31 are sufficiently smooth ",
    "see caffarelli & evans @xcite and dibenedetto @xcite .",
    "more recently , the notion of viscosity solutions , first introduced by crandall & lions @xcite , has been proved useful in the qualitative study of free boundary problems , due to its flexibility with nonlinear pdes and free boundary conditions : see e.g. , @xcite@xcite and @xcite which address a general class of free boundary problems including , and also see @xcite where the heat operator is replaced by a class of uniformly parabolic operators .",
    "however , in the two - phase case , the equivalence between viscosity solutions and weak solutions , and in particular the uniqueness of the viscosity solutions of , has not yet been investigated , even in the case of .",
    "( the only notable instance is @xcite where the authors show a comparison principle between viscosity subsolutions and more regular supersolutions , so - called `` r - supersolutions '' . even thought their result could be used to simplify the proof of lemma  [ th : zgradient ] , it is restricted to the heat operator , whereas our method is more robust and extends to a wider class of problems , see remark  [ extension ] . ) in this paper we address precisely this point .",
    "we introduce a notion of viscosity solutions for , to derive the following theorem :    [ main ]    * there exists a viscosity solution of in @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , a _ comparison principle _ holds between viscosity solutions and thus maximal and minimal viscosity solutions exist .",
    "they respectively correspond to weak solutions of with maximal and minimal initial enthalpy for given temperature @xmath34 . + * any weak solution of in the sense of @xcite is also a viscosity solution . + * if @xmath35 , then there is a unique viscosity solution of which coincides with the weak solution of , and also coincides with the notion of viscosity solutions discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "previously , one of the authors investigated in @xcite viscosity solutions theory for the one - phase version of ( also see @xcite and @xcite for the case of degenerate diffusion ) .",
    "while one - phase stefan problem is a special case of the two - phase stefan problem , this work does not immediately apply to the two - phase version : we will point out the differences as we proceed in the proof .",
    "for example , the free boundary evolution for the two - phase setting is no longer monotone ( that is , the positive set of @xmath16 may shrink or expand over time ) , which requires a more careful construction of test functions . moreover , since we are allowing the initial data to have mushy region , @xmath18 may have positive measure with infinite speed of propagation , and thus must be treated differently .",
    "indeed , to the best of our knowledge , theorem  [ main ] is among the first results which addresses uniqueness of viscosity solutions for a two - phase free boundary problem .",
    "below we give an outline of the paper :    in sections  [ sec : problem ] and [ sec : comparison ] we introduce a definition of viscosity solutions for , and prove that viscosity solutions satisfy a comparison principle for strictly separated initial data . note that this does not immediately yield uniqueness except under some geometric conditions on the initial data ( see corollary  [ cor : unique ] ) , however it generates a maximal and minimal viscosity solutions ( see proposition  [ prop : maximal ] ) .",
    "these maximal and minimal solutions indeed correspond to the weak solutions with maximal and minimal initial enthalpy .    in section  [ sec : weakareviscosity ]",
    ", we show that weak solutions are viscosity solutions . using this result , existence of viscosity solutions",
    "is established .",
    "furthermore , using the uniqueness of the weak solutions and barrier arguments near the parabolic boundary of @xmath33 ( see lemma  [ convergence ] ) , we establish the uniqueness of viscosity solutions when @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "[ extension ] the proof of the comparison principle ( theorem  [ th : comparison ] ) relies only on the comparison principle available for the parabolic operator @xmath38 and monotonicity of the boundary condition .",
    "it therefore applies to the generalized version of described in @xcite , where the second equation in is replaced by a general free boundary velocity of the type @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spatial ( outward ) unit normal vector of @xmath18 , @xmath41 is continuous and @xmath42 and in fact , a general uniformly parabolic operator @xmath43 discussed in @xcite can be considered in @xmath44 .",
    "that is , we require that @xmath45 is an uniformly elliptic operator such that @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the use of hopf s lemma at the end of the proof of theorem  [ th : comparison ] can be omitted if we consider the inf - convolution @xmath54 in on shrinking balls as in @xcite , which only requires a more demanding notation .    as for existence ,",
    "a slight modification of perron s method presented in @xcite combined with theorem  [ th : comparison ] yields the existence of a viscosity solution for the generalized version .",
