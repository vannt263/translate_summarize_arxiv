    "the study of finite temperature crossovers in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions is a subject with a long history  @xcite , but many aspects of it remain poorly understood .",
    "the structure of the crossovers is especially rich for the case where the quantum critical point extends into a line of finite temperature phase transitions , and there is a reasonable qualitative understanding of all the regimes . while there have been quantitative calculations of crossover functions in special cases  @xcite",
    "there is no complete , general theory of these crossovers , especially for the case when the quantum critical point is below its upper critical dimension .    in this paper",
    ", we shall provide a new systematic and controlled approach to the quantitative computation of these crossover functions .",
    "our method is quite general : it should apply to essentially all quantum critical points in the vicinity of , or above , their upper - critical dimension .",
    "recently , oconnor and stephens  @xcite have also studied crossovers near relativistic quantum - critical points below their upper - critical dimension .",

    "we shall describe how our method can be extended to arbitrary orders in an expansion in powers of the interactions , but we shall only provide here explicit computations at low orders .",
    "one of the main virtues of our method is that it clearly separates contributions of fluctuations of different physical origins : critical singularities of the @xmath2 quantum - critical point , and those of the finite @xmath0 classical phase transition , are accounted for at distinct stages of the calculation .",
    "we shall present most of our discussion in the context of a continuum quantum field theory ( cqft ) of a @xmath7-component bosonic field @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ; we will drop the index @xmath24 except where needed ) with @xmath25 symmetry and with the bare , imaginary time ( @xmath26 ) action @xmath27 + \\frac{u_0}{4 ! } \\phi^4",

    "the generalization of our method to other quantum field theories , like the dilute bose gas , or the models for onset of antiferromagnetism in fermi liquids , is straightforward and will also be discussed .",

    "precisely the same renormalizations are also sufficient to define a finite theory at non - zero @xmath0 , _ even in the vicinity of the finite @xmath0 phase transition line _ , as we shall explicitly see in this paper .",
    "we show a sketch of the phase diagram of @xmath36 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 in fig  [ f1 ]  @xcite . we have assumed in this figure , and throughout the remainder of the paper that the model @xmath44 is in its scaling limit _",
    "i.e. _ the coupling @xmath32 is at its fixed point value , and all ultraviolet cutoffs have been sent to infinity after an appropriate renormalization procedure .",
    "there is a finite temperature phase transition line at @xmath45 , and all other boundaries are smooth crossovers .",
    "all of the physics is contained within universal quantum - critical crossover functions , which we now briefly describe .",
    "we will consider the behavior of the dynamic two - point susceptibility , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is a spatial momentum , and @xmath18 is a frequency ) obtained after analytic continuation of the susceptibility @xmath48 which is evaluated at matsubara frequency @xmath49 .",
    "we will consider the scaling behavior of @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 separately , and then discuss the relationship between the two cases .",
    "( _ i _ ) @xmath51 : the susceptibility @xmath50 obeys the scaling form  @xcite @xmath53 where we have momentarily re - inserted all factors of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the usual field anomalous dimension of the @xmath2 , @xmath37 dimensional theory , and @xmath58 is a fully universal , complex - valued , universal scaling function .",
    "notice that there are no arbitrary scale factors , and @xmath50 is fully determined by two parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which are properties of the @xmath2 theory .",
    "the first of these , @xmath59 , is the true energy gap above the ground state , while the second , @xmath60 , is the residue of the lowest quasi - particle excitation ; they obey @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the usual correlation length exponent of the @xmath2 theory ( all greek letter exponents in this paper refer to those of @xmath2 the quantum - critical point , and not to those the finite @xmath0 phase transition ) .",
    "we provide a computation of the values of the @xmath2 parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath63 , in appendix  [ zerot ] .",
    "the factors in front of @xmath58 in ( [ scalep ] ) have been chosen so that @xmath58 is finite at @xmath64 .",
    "all scaling functions defined in this paper will share this property .",
    "we also emphasize that although the scaling ansatz ( [ scalep ] ) contains dynamic information , its form and content are quite different from the dynamic scaling hypotheses applied near classical phase transitions  @xcite . in these classical systems , a single diverging correlation length , @xmath65 , is used to set the scale for @xmath47 and @xmath18 ; the analog of ( [ scalep ] ) is then a scaling function of _ two _ arguments , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the classical dynamic critical exponent .",
    "in contrast , the quantum crossover result ( [ scalep ] ) is a function of _ three _ arguments , the extra argument arising because the quantum critical point has two relevant perturbations ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "further , the identification of universal scale factors , and indeed the conceptualization of the physics , is much more transparent when @xmath0 is used as the primary energy setting the scale for other perturbations . only in the immediate vicnity of the finite @xmath0 phase transition at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , does ( [ scalep ] ) collapse into a scaling function of two arguments , as has been discussed in refs  @xcite .",
    "although we have used two separate scaling forms to describe the behavior for @xmath52 and @xmath51 , there is a crucial connection between them .",

    "this implies that the observable @xmath98 ( and indeed all other observables ) must be .",
    "this principle will serve as an extremely important constraint on the calculation in this paper ; indeed , our method is designed to ensure that analyticity holds at each order . further ,",
    "our results in the region @xmath52 , @xmath99 , were obtained by a process of analytic continuation from the @xmath51 , @xmath21 region ( see fig  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the ground state for @xmath52 has a spontaneously broken symmetry , and hence can not be used to access the symmetric @xmath52 , @xmath99 region in perturbation theory ; instead it is more naturally accessed from the disordered side with @xmath51 .",
    "a similar procedure of analytic continuation in coupling constant was used recently in exact determinations of quantum critical scaling functions in @xmath93  @xcite .    before turning to a description of our method in section  [ sec :",
    "method ] , we highlight one of our new results . a particularly interesting property of cqft s at finite @xmath0 is the expected thermal relaxational behavior of their correlators in real time .",
    "this behavior can not be characterized simply to a field - theorist who merely considers correlators of @xmath36 , defined as a cqft in imaginary time with a spacetime geometry @xmath100 ( the tensor product of infinite @xmath34-dimensional flat space with a circle of circumference @xmath101 ) . in real frequency , the thermal relaxational behavior is characterized by the fact that @xmath102 is expected to be finite , with the limiting value proportional to a relaxation constant . in ref",
    "@xcite , the quantity @xmath103 was introduced as a convenient characterization of the relaxation rate . by ( [ scalep ] )",
    ", @xmath104 must obey a scaling form given by @xmath105 for @xmath51 , and similarly for @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , in the high @xmath0 limit of the cqft  @xcite ( this is region ii of fig  [ f1 ] ) , @xmath104 is @xmath106 times @xmath107 , which is expected to be a finite , universal number .",
    "unfortunately , we shall find that the perturbative expansion discussed in this paper can not be used to obtain a systematic expansion for @xmath104 .",
    "a self - consistent approach , with damping of intermediate states , appears necessary and will not be discussed here . in the high @xmath0 limit",
    ", we shall show that the non - self - consistent approach fails for frequencies of order @xmath108 or smaller . to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "let us define an alternative characterization of the damping at frequencies of order @xmath109 by @xmath110 this will obey a scaling form identical to that of @xmath104 .",

    "the result will be compared with an exact result for @xmath113 for @xmath93 , @xmath10 in section  [ twoloop ] .",
    "also in the exact result at @xmath93 , @xmath10 we find @xmath114 in the high @xmath0 limit , and we expect a similar ratio close to unity in all cases in region ii of fig  [ f1 ] .",
    "the following subsection contains a description of our approach .",
    "readers not interested in the details of its application to @xmath36 , can read section  [ sec : method ] , and skip ahead to section  [ conc ] where we give our unified perspective of this and earlier work .",
    "we will revert to setting @xmath115 in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the origin of the approach we shall take here can be traced to early work by luscher  @xcite on the quantum @xmath25 non - linear sigma model in @xmath116 dimensions .",
    "subsequently , a related idea was employed by brezin and zinn - justin  @xcite and by rudnick , guo and jasnow  @xcite in their study of finite - size scaling crossover functions in systems which are finite in all , or all but one , dimensions ( also referred to as the @xmath117 and @xmath118 crossovers ) .",
    "the quantum - critical crossovers are clearly related , but now involve @xmath119 .",
    "we shall show here that the latter problem can be successfully analyzed by essentially the same method as that used for the former .",
    "there are some new subtleties that arise in a limited region of the phase diagram , and we will discuss below how they can be dealt with .    we will describe the method here for the special case of the action @xmath36 ( eqn ( [ cals ] ) ) with @xmath34 below its upper critical dimension _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12 .",
    "the central idea is that at finite @xmath0 , it is safe to integrate out all modes of @xmath120 with a non - zero matsubara frequency , @xmath121 , to derive an effective action for zero frequency modes @xmath122 .",
    "all modes being integrated out are regulated in the infrared by the @xmath123 term in their propagator , and so the process is necessarily free of infrared divergences ; further , the renormalizations of the @xmath2 theory also control the ultraviolet divergences at finite @xmath0 . to be specific ,",
    "let us define @xmath124 and its transform in momentum space @xmath125 . then from @xmath36",
    ", we can deduce an effective action for @xmath126 after completely integrating out the @xmath127 ( we have set the coupling @xmath32 at the fixed - point of its @xmath128-function  see appendix  [ zerot ] ) : @xmath129 . \\label{seff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the couplings @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , are computed in a power series in @xmath15 , with the coupling constants renormalized as in the @xmath2 , @xmath37 dimensional critical theory .",
    "this procedure will remove all the ultraviolet divergences of the quantum critical point .",
    "however , the ultraviolet divergences of the finite @xmath0 , @xmath34-dimensional @xmath8 theory remain ; fortunately these are very simple as the @xmath8 theory is _ super - renormalizable _ for @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 , ultraviolet divergences are associated only with the one - loop ` tadpole ' graphs ; so let us define @xmath134 where the ellipses refer to `` tadpole '' contributions from higher order vertices like @xmath135 , @xmath136 @xmath132 .",
    "similarly , there will also be tadpole renormalizations of @xmath131 to @xmath137 by higher order vertices , and so on .",
    "these new vertices , @xmath138 , @xmath139 integer , are now free of all ultraviolet divergences ( for @xmath140 there is a second classical renormalization at the two - loop level which must be accounted for ; we will ignore this complication here and deal with it later in the paper ) .",
    "they are also automatically free of infrared divergences as we are only integrating out modes with a finite frequency .",
    "indeed , these vertices must obey the scaling forms : @xmath141 for @xmath51 , with the @xmath142 a set of quantum scaling functions ; the subscript @xmath143 emphasizes that these scaling functions are properties of the @xmath2 quantum - critical point , and distinguishes them from classical crossover functions we shall use later .",
    "similar scaling results hold for @xmath52 and we will refrain from explicitly displaying them . for our subsequent discussion it is useful to define a set of couplings @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , which can be obtained from the @xmath138 , and which play an important role in our analysis :",
    "@xmath147 it is clear that @xmath145 , @xmath144 , and @xmath146 obey scaling forms that can be easily deduced from ( [ cscale ] ) .",
    "we also note that the couplings @xmath145 and @xmath148 are guaranteed to be analytic as a function of @xmath1 at @xmath3 ; this is because only finite frequency modes have been integrated out , and their propagator @xmath149 is not singular at @xmath3 in the infrared ( @xmath150 ) as @xmath151 .",
    "this analyticity will be of great use to us later .",
    "assume , for the rest of this section , that we know the @xmath152 functions ( we will provide explicit computations of some of them later in the paper ) .",
    "we are now faced with the seemingly difficult problem of computing observables in the @xmath153 theory with the action @xmath154 .",
    "this is a theory in dimension @xmath34 close to 3 ( _ not _",
    "@xmath34 close to 4 ) , and one might naively assume , that this problem is intractable .",
    "we shall now argue that , in fact , it is not . the argument is contained in the following two simple , but important , observations .",
    "+ ( 1 ) consider a perturbation theory of @xmath154 in which the propagator is @xmath155 , and we expand in the non - linearities @xmath148 , @xmath156 in powers of @xmath15 .",
    "this expansion differs from an ordinary expansion in powers of @xmath15 only in that the mass @xmath145 and coupling @xmath144 itself contain corrections in powers of @xmath15 ; alternatively one could also treat @xmath157 as an interaction , and work with the propagator @xmath158 , but it is essential to keep the mass @xmath145 in the propagator .",
    "such a procedure is guaranteed to be finite in the ultraviolet .",
    "this follows immediately from the statement that the renormalization of the @xmath2 theory ( which we carried out while obtaining @xmath154 from @xmath36 ) is sufficient to remove ultraviolet divergences even at non - zero @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "the momentum dependencies in the @xmath148 must be such that all ultraviolet divergences cancel out . + ( 2 )",
    "the action @xmath154 is weakly coupled over the bulk of the phase diagram in the @xmath159 plane , and so the procedure in ( 1 ) leads to accurate results for physical observables . only in the region",
    "@xmath160 ( drawn shaded in fig  [ f1 ] ) is a more sophisticated analysis necessary , which will be described momentarily . to verify this claim ,",
    "consider the values of the low order couplings in @xmath161 at @xmath3 , but @xmath0 finite ; we will find later that @xmath162 for @xmath3 .",
    "( for the present purpose , we can neglect all @xmath138 for @xmath163 as they are all of order @xmath164 . )",
    "a dimensionless measure of the strength of non - linearities in @xmath154 is @xmath165 the above dimensionless ratio is simply that appearing in the familiar ginzburg criterion  @xcite .",
    "so a simple perturbative calculation is adequate for @xmath3 . for @xmath51 , the behavior of perturbation theory can only improve as the mass @xmath145 becomes larger , which decreases the value of the above dimensionless ratio ; as a result the perturbative calculation describes the crossover between the quantum - critical and quantum - disordered regimes of fig  [ f1 ] . for @xmath52",
    "the perturbation theory is initially adequate , but eventually becomes unreliable in the region @xmath166 .",
    "as the above results contain some the key points which allowed the computations of this paper , it is useful to reiterate them .",
    "we describe the nature of our expansion , excluding the shaded region @xmath167 of fig  [ f1 ] .",
    "the first step is to obtain an expansion for the ` mass ' @xmath145 of the @xmath168 mode : we outlined above a procedure which yields a series in integer powers of @xmath15 .",
    "then , generate an expansion for the physical observable of interest , temporarily treating @xmath145 as a fixed constant independent of @xmath15 ; this will again be a series in integer powers of @xmath15 , but strong infrared fluctuations of the @xmath169 mode lead to a singular dependence of the latter series on @xmath145 . finally , insert the former series for @xmath145 into the latter series for the physical observable . in the quantum - disordered region ( fig  [ f1 ] ) , @xmath145 is of order unity , and the final result remains a series in integer powers of @xmath15 .",
    "however , in the quantum - critical region , @xmath145 is of order @xmath15 ( eqn ( [ valkru ] ) ) and the result , by ( [ ratio ] ) , is a series in integer powers of @xmath16 , with possibly a finite number of powers of @xmath17 multiplying the terms .",
    "it is important to note that the final series in powers of @xmath16 is obtained from the original series in powers of @xmath15 only by a local re - arrangement of terms _ i.e. _ given all the terms up to a certain order in the @xmath15 series , we can obtain all terms below a related order in the @xmath16 series .",
    "finally , let us turn our attention to the troublesome region @xmath166 .",
    "we expect this region to be dominated by the classical fluctuations characteristic of the finite temperature transition , and hence to be well described by the following action @xmath170 , which is a truncated form of @xmath154 : @xmath171 . \\label{scl}\\ ] ] the couplings above were defined in ( [ defu ] ) .",
    "we have implicitly performed tadpole renormalizations where necessary to remove ultraviolet divergences of the classical theory .",
    "an immediate consequence of the super - renormalizability of the classical @xmath172 is that all observables are universal functions of the `` bare '' coupling constants @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath173 .",
    "so for example , we have for the static susceptibility @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a universal crossover function with no arbitrary scale factors .",
    "in fact , the crossover function @xmath175 has been considered earlier in ref  @xcite , where it was dubbed the _ tricritical crossover function _ for entirely different physical reasons ( we emphasize that this terminology is purely accidental - we are not dealing with any tricritical point here ) .",
    "the computation of tricritical crossover functions is a logically separate problem from those considered in this paper , and we shall have relatively little to say about them here . we shall simply treat them as known , previously computed functions ; for completeness , we tabulate some results on these functions in appendix  [ tricritical ] .",
    "notice that the arguments of the classical crossover function @xmath175 in ( [ psicl ] ) are themselves quantum - critical crossover functions , as follows from ( [ cscale ] ) and ( [ defu ] ) .",
    "indeed , inserting ( [ cscale ] ) and ( [ defu ] ) into ( [ psicl ] ) , we get a scaling form completely consistent with ( [ scalep ] ) .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath87 , is determined by the condition @xmath176 ; in general , this is not equivalent to the requirement @xmath177 ( although this does turn out to be the case at the one - loop level ) , but is instead given by the point where the scaling function @xmath178 diverges .",
    "this condition leads to equation @xmath179 where the constant is determined by the point where @xmath178 diverges as a function of its second argument ; it is the solution of this equation which leads to the @xmath180 corrections to the result for @xmath87 reported in ( [ restc1 ] ) .    to summarize , in the region @xmath181 , the physics is described by universal crossover functions , @xmath182 , which are `` crossover functions ( @xmath178 ) of crossover functions ( @xmath183 ) '' .",
    "the @xmath183 functions are properties of the quantum - critical point , and it is the burden of this paper to compute them ; these functions then serve as arguments of known classical , tricritical crossover functions ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "finally , we note that for @xmath34 just below 3 , it is also necessary to include a coupling @xmath184 in @xmath36 to get the correct infrared behavior ; we have ignored this complication for simplicity ; moreover , as @xmath185 and this effect is present only at a rather high order .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : below ] we will compute properties of @xmath36 for @xmath12 .",
    "the discussion is divided into a one - loop computation of static observables in section  [ oneloop ] and a two loop computation of dynamic observables in section  [ twoloop ] .",
    "section  [ sec : above ] will present a general discussion of the properties of models above their upper critical dimension : the modifications necessary in the scaling forms and the explicit computation of crossover functions . finally section  [ conc ] will review the main results , discuss their relationship to previous works , and point out directions for future work .",
    "a number of details of the calculations appear in the appendices .",
    "the tricritical crossover functions appearing in ( [ psicl ] ) are in appendix  [ tricritical ] . in appendix  [ zerot ]",
    "we compute the @xmath2 parameters that appear in the scaling forms .",
    "details of the finite @xmath0 two - loop computations of various quantities are in appendix  [ tgt0 ] .",
    "a number of crossover functions for the model @xmath36 were introduced in section  [ intro ] .",
    "we give formal expressions , valid to two - loop order , for all of these quantities in appendix  [ tgt0 ] . in this section",
    "we will evaluate these expressions and show that they obey the required scaling forms order - by - order in @xmath15 .",
    "we will discuss the behavior for general values of @xmath1 only to one - loop order in section  [ oneloop ] .",
    "we will limit our explicit two - loop results to a few important quantities at the critical coupling @xmath3 ; these will appear in section  [ twoloop ] .",
    "the same basic trick will be repeatedly used to evaluate the frequency summations in appendix  [ tgt0 ] : we will always subtract from the summation of a function of @xmath186 , the integration over frequency of precisely the same function .",
    "the resulting difference will always turn out to be strongly convergent as a function of momentum in all @xmath34 .",
    "so , for example , we have : @xmath187 notice that the integrand on the right hand side of the last equation falls off exponentially for large @xmath188 , and the integral is therefore convergent for all @xmath34",
