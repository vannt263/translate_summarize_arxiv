    "the highest weight becomes doubly degenerate due to the presence of zero mode @xmath90 .",

    "the obtained rtt - relation ( 21 ) and corresponding quantum integrability condition give us possibility to consider the model possessing the associated i m from a point of view of qism @xcite , @xcite . in our case",
    "the class of such systems is very wide .",
    "it contains all the superconformal ( minimal ) models and some of their perturbations ( though in the unperturbed case scft usually provides easier methods ) .",
    "the perturbations that do not break the integrability ( commuting with i m ) and therefore appropriate for the qism scheme are ( following the arguments of @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath197 and @xmath198 operators , corresponding to the vertex operators @xmath199 .",
    "the topic of special interest is the scft with perturbation on the boundary related to the d - brane theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ in order to find the eigenvalues of the transfer matrices ( they are our main object of study , because their expansion in @xmath57 gives the quantum i m ) one can follow two routes . the first one , introduced in @xcite , is based on the so - called `` fusion relations '' @xcite for the transfer matrices .",
    "in the case when @xmath200 is a root of unity ( @xmath201 and @xmath202 are rational ) , the system of fusion relations becomes finite and reduces to the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations @xcite .",
    "+ another approach is the baxter q - operator method , which could be applied for all values of @xmath201 ( therefore for all values of the central charge)@xcite .",
