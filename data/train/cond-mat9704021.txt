    "since the landmark discovery  @xcite of long - range icosahedral quasiperiodic ordering in al - mn alloys , thermodynamically stable quasicrystals have been produced in a rich variety of systems  @xcite .",
    "the fact remains , however , that all known quasicrystals are alloys of at least two metallic elements .",
    "a fundamental question has thus naturally arisen : can one - component quasicrystals be thermodynamically stable ?",
    "an icosahedral quasiperiodic phase having lower ground - state enthalpy than periodic crystals has in fact been predicted for an idealized system of particles interacting via a square - well pair potential  @xcite .",
    "the stability range is confined , however , to a very narrow range of well widths and pressures and the physical relevance is unclear . on a much broader scale",
    ", the question has been addressed by extensive lattice - sum potential energy calculations  @xcite for a variety of crystals and quasicrystals interacting via effective metallic pair potentials generated by pseudopotential theory .",
    "the important conclusion of these studies is that energetically stable ground - state one - component quasicrystals are indeed possible , albeit within a restricted range of pair potential parameters having no counterparts in the periodic table .",
    "although very useful for identifying general trends in relative structural stabilities , the lattice - sum approach , because it takes into account only internal energy , is restricted to zero temperature .",
    "therefore it can not directly address the general issue of _ thermodynamic _ stability .",
    "an alternative theoretical approach , especially suited to finite temperatures , is the classical density - functional ( df ) approach  @xcite , by which the thermodynamic free energy is determined as a variational minimum with respect to density of an approximate free energy functional .",
    "important fundamental applications have already been made to systems of hard spheres with quasiperiodic order  @xcite .",
    "distinguished as they are by purely entropic ( structure - dependent ) free energy , hard - sphere ( hs ) systems are ideally suited for focusing exclusively on the role of entropy in stabilizing competing structures . because the infinitely repulsive hs pair potential lacks an energy scale , however ,",
    "temperature in this case is irrelevant to static properties .",
    "comparing elementary crystals with model quasicrystalline structures , the quasicrystals were predicted to be either higher in free energy and thus metastable ( in fact , relative even to the fluid phase )  @xcite or mechanically unstable ( no variational minimum )  @xcite .",
    "these studies clearly suggest that ordinary entropy ( associated with phonons and disorder ) is by itself insufficient to stabilize quasiperiodic ordering . the previous lattice - sum and df studies leave open",
    ", however , the question of whether at finite temperatures longer - range interactions can conspire to stabilize one - component quasicrystalline structures .    our main goal in this paper is to bridge the gap between previous studies by extending classical df methods to simple metallic systems whose effective pair interactions may be derived from pseudopotential theory . by varying the parameters that define the pair potential , we are able to systematically survey a range of physically relevant systems and thermodynamic states for the possible existence of stable one - component quasicrystals . as a structural model ,",
    "we focus here on a certain class of rational approximants , periodic crystals with large unit cells whose atomic configurations realistically model quasicrystalline order . as our main result",
    ", we indeed find , over a limited range of pseudopotential parameters , thermodynamically stable one - component quasicrystals , whose stabilities are largely attributable to medium- and long - range interactions . as an incidental result",
    ", we also predict mechanically stable , but thermodynamically unstable , hs rational approximants , thus supporting conclusions of previous df studies for hs systems  @xcite .    we proceed in sec .",
    "ii by outlining the calculation of the effective metallic pair potentials .",
    "these constitute a fundamental input to the theory described in sec .",
    "iii , which combines classical df methods with thermodynamic perturbation theory . in sec .",
    "iv , after first describing the quasicrystal structural model , we present results , from a broad survey of pseudopotential parameters , for trends in the relative stabilities of various solid structures . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize and conclude with some remarks on the implications of our study for the stabilities of real quasicrystals .",
    "interactions between ions in a metal are complicated by the presence of conduction ( or valence ) electrons , whose response to the ions in many cases must be determined by elaborate methods of electronic df theory  @xcite . however ,",
    "when the energy levels of core and conduction electrons are sufficiently well separated , as they are in the simple metals ( _ e.g. _ , al , mg , and the alkalis ) , the conduction electrons may be justly regarded as nearly free  @xcite .",
    "it then proves possible to replace the strong electron - ion potential by a much weaker _ pseudopotential _ , which has no bound states but preserves the true valence energy spectrum .",
    "the pseudopotential approach  @xcite has been refined over three decades and , with remarkable success , has helped to explain a wide range of structural and thermodynamic properties of solids , including variations in crystal structure through the periodic table  @xcite .",
    "its conceptual appeal lies in its reduction of the two - component system of electrons and ions to an effective one - component system of pseudoatoms .",
    "the reduction is achieved by regarding the pseudopotential as a weak perturbation to a uniform gas of valence electrons , which is further assumed to respond adiabatically and linearly to the effective static external potential imposed by the ions .",
    "in linear response theory , the fourier components of the induced electron density @xmath0 and the ion density @xmath1 are simply related by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the static electron - density response function . to second order in perturbation theory ,",
    "the effective ion - ion pair potential then takes the fourier - space form @xmath4 , \\label{pp}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the fourier transform of the bare coulomb interaction and @xmath6 is the dielectric function , whose density dependence naturally gives rise to _ density - dependent _ effective pair potentials .",
    "the dielectric and static response functions are closely related through @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lindhard free electron density response function and @xmath9 is the local field correction , which incorporates exchange and correlation effects .",
    "experience has shown  @xcite that the accuracy of the effective pair potential is particularly sensitive to the choice of @xmath9 . here",
    "we take the analytic form proposed by ichimaru and utsumi  @xcite , which accurately fits monte carlo data for the correlation energy and satisfies important self - consistency conditions .",
    "the choice of pseudopotential is less critical , and in practice a parametrized form is often assumed and fitted to experimental data for transport and other properties sensitive to electron - ion interactions .",
    "a particularly simple and popular form , which we have adopted here , is the ( local and energy - independent ) empty - core pseudopotential  @xcite @xmath10 parametrized by valence @xmath11 and core radius @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting real - space effective pair potential @xmath13 following from eqs .",
    "( 2 - 4 ) is illustrated in fig .  1 for several values of atomic volume @xmath14 ( or number density @xmath15 ) , valence , and core radius as a ratio of the electron - sphere radius @xmath16 .",
    "( note that we use atomic units throughout , representing energies in milli - rydbergs and lengths in bohr radii @xmath17 . )",
    "as is typical for the simple metals , @xmath13 is characterised by a steeply repulsive short - range core , arising from screening of the bare ion - ion interaction by polarization of the electrons , and a relatively weak oscillating tail , dominated by friedel oscillations with periodicity @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being the fermi wavevector magnitude )",
    ". extensive analysis  @xcite has shown that the form of the potential in the vicinity of the nearest - neighbor distance depends sensitively on the interplay between the core and tail regions .",
    "in particular , with increasing electron density ( increasing @xmath11 or decreasing @xmath14 ) at fixed @xmath20 , the core shifts to shorter distances and the wavelength of the friedel oscillations shortens [ fig .  1 ( a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "correspondingly , the core repulsion steepens and the depth of the first minimum becomes shallower as the oscillations move under the core .",
    "for sufficiently high electron density , the first minimum may be covered by the core , resulting in a repulsive shoulder , as seen in fig .  1 ( a ) for the case of @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , with decreasing core radius for fixed @xmath11 , the friedel oscillations weaken in amplitude and shorten in wavelength . for sufficiently small @xmath12 ,",
    "the first minimum similarly may be pushed to larger distances , as seen in fig .  1 ( c ) for the case @xmath22 . in sec .",
    "iv b we discuss the influence of these properties of @xmath13 on structural stabilities of solids .",
    "with effective pair potentials in hand , we may now in a sense regard the electronic structure problem as solved  albeit trivially in this case  and henceforth consider , at fixed average density , a purely classical one - component system of pair - wise interacting pseudoatoms .",
    "we thus proceed to take @xmath13 as input to a classical df theory for the helmholtz free energy , the central quantity of interest in assessing relative stabilities of competing solid structures .",
    "the df approach  @xcite provides a general framework for describing nonuniform systems , of which solids are extreme examples . for classical systems , it is founded on the definition of a functional @xmath23 $ ] of the spatially - varying one - particle number density @xmath24 , which satisfies a fundamental variational principle  @xcite , according to which @xmath23 $ ] is minimized ( at constant average density ) by the equilibrium density , its minimum value equaling the helmholtz free energy . for convenience , @xmath23 $ ]",
    "is separated into ideal - gas and excess contributions : @xmath25=f_{id}[\\rho]+f_{ex}[\\rho ] .",
    "\\label{fidex}\\ ] ] the first term is the free energy of the nonuniform system in the absence of interactions , directly related to the configurational entropy , and is given exactly by @xmath26= k_bt\\int d{\\bf r}\\rho({\\bf r})[\\ln(\\rho({\\bf r})\\lambda^3)-1 ] , \\label{fid1}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the thermal de broglie wavelength and @xmath28 is temperature .",
    "the excess contribution depends entirely upon internal interactions and is not known exactly .",
    "approximations for @xmath29 $ ] abound , but experience has proven the class of so - called weighted - density approximations  @xcite ( wda ) to be especially useful in a variety of contexts  @xcite .",
    "these are all based on a mapping of the nonuniform excess free energy onto its uniform counterpart , as discussed further below .",
    "it should be emphasized that here we entirely ignore a sizable volume - dependent , but structure - independent , term in the free energy associated with the electrons  @xcite .",
    "this is justified by the fact that here we are concerned only with the relative stabilities of different solid structures and thus always compare free energies of solids at the _ same average density_. in applications to phase transitions , however , the volume term would have to be included for coexisting phases having different densities .",
    "although there have been numerous successful applications of df theory to simple atomic systems  @xcite ( _ e.g. , _ hs and lennard - jones potentials ) , few thus far have considered metals  @xcite .",
    "studies with other long - range pair potentials have shown  @xcite , however , that weighted - density methods are often best applied in combination with thermodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "the essential reason is that a single mapping proves insufficient to accurately approximate both the excess entropy and the internal energy  @xcite . as seen from fig .  1 ,",
    "the basic form of @xmath13 for the simple metals lends itself naturally to a perturbation approach , wherein the full pair potential is sensibly split into a short - range reference potential @xmath30 and a perturbation potential @xmath31 .",
    "such an approach has already been applied successfully to the structure and thermodynamics of lennard - jones liquids  @xcite and solids  @xcite and of metallic liquids  @xcite and solids  @xcite .",
    "the helmholtz free energy may be correspondingly separated and formally expressed in the exact form  @xcite @xmath25 = f_o[\\rho ] + { 1\\over{2}}\\int_0 ^ 1 d\\lambda\\int d{\\bf r}\\int d{\\bf r } ' \\rho^{(2)}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}';\\phi_{\\lambda})\\phi_p(|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| ) , \\label{pert1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the two - particle density for a system interacting via the pair potential @xmath33 .",
    "the reference free energy @xmath34 $ ] includes the ideal - gas free energy and the part of the excess free energy associated with short - range interactions , while the perturbation term is the remaining part of the excess free energy deriving from medium- and long - range interactions .",
    "further expanding @xmath35 about the reference pair potential , and retaining only the leading term , leads directly to the first - order perturbation approximation , @xmath25 \\simeq f_o[\\rho ] + { 1\\over{2}}\\int d{\\bf r}\\int d{\\bf r } ' \\rho({\\bf r})\\rho({\\bf r}')g_o({\\bf",

    "r}'| ) , \\label{pert2}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the pair distribution function of the reference system ( radial distribution function for a uniform liquid ) .",
    "the second - order term in the perturbation expansion @xmath37 may be expressed in terms of the mean - square fluctuation of the total perturbation energy @xmath38 according to @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes an ensemble average for the reference system . in general , the @xmath41th term in the expansion @xmath42 may be expressed in terms of the mean fluctuations @xmath43 divided by @xmath44 , with @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , convergence of the expansion is determined by the magnitude of fluctuations in @xmath46 relative to @xmath47 .",
    "we return to the issue of convergence in sec .",
    "v. some freedom remains in the separation of the pair potential and in the choice of reference system .",
    "here we use the standard weeks - chandler - andersen  @xcite ( wca ) separation , which splits the potential at its first minimum and shifts it such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 the strongly repulsive reference system we map onto a system of hard spheres of effective diameter @xmath50 . although the wca prescription  @xcite for @xmath50 is usually considered superior for liquids , application to solids is problematic because the required function @xmath36 is relatively poorly known ( see below ) .",

    "( [ pert2 ] ) ] demands detailed knowledge of the hs solid pair distribution function @xmath62 .",
    "although its translational average is partially known from monte carlo studies  @xcite , the published data and analytic fits are limited to particular solid structures ( close - packed crystals ) at specific densities . in many applications ,",
    "however , the function is needed over a range of densities , and here also for a variety of solid structures . for practical purposes , various approximations for @xmath61",
    "have been proposed .",
    "jones and ashcroft  @xcite and curtin  @xcite have calculated the free energy of the lj solid by approximating the spherical average of the two - particle density in the solid by that in the isotropic liquid , thereby ignoring any dependence upon solid structure .",
    "clearly this is insufficient for comparing relative stabilites of different solid structures .",
    "curtin and ashcroft  @xcite have derived a structure - dependent correction , involving the difference between the true and reference system direct correlation functions , and have employed an empirical prescription to study the lennard - jones crystal .",
    "more recently , mederos _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed , in the spirit of the wda , mapping the pair distribution function of the solid onto the corresponding radial distribution function of the fluid , but evaluated at an effective density chosen to satisfy a local compressibility relation . in practice ,",
    "the requisite density is found to be so low that the approximation is essentially equivalent to replacing @xmath62 by its ideal - gas limit , the heaviside unit step function @xmath63 , defined by @xmath64 this amounts to a mean - field approximation in which self - correlations are forbidden but correlations are otherwise entirely neglected .",
    "the underlying justification  @xcite is the fact that in an ordered solid , unlike in a dense liquid , most of the structure of the two - particle density is contained already at the level of the one - particle density , rendering @xmath65 a relatively structureless function .",
    "because of its practicality and its success when applied to the lennard - jones  @xcite and other  @xcite systems , we have adopted this approximation for the perturbation free energy .",
    "finally , collecting together the above - mentioned df and perturbation approximations , our working free energy functional is expressed as @xmath25 \\simeq f_{hs}^{mwda}[\\rho;d ] +   { 1\\over{2}}\\int d{\\bf r}\\int d{\\bf r } ' \\rho({\\bf r})\\rho({\\bf r}')u(|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|-d ) \\phi_p(|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| ) , \\label{f}\\ ] ] which is to be variationally minimized with respect to the solid number density @xmath24 .",
    "the perturbation free energy evidently amounts to a lattice - sum over @xmath66 , but one that incorporates thermal broadening of the density distribution .",
    "note that the temperature dependence of the total free energy consists of a trivial ( linear ) dependence of the hs reference free energy and a non - trivial dependence through the effective hs diameter @xmath50 [ eq .  ( [ bh ] ) ] .",
    "the free energy of the liquid phase is calculated , at the same level of perturbation theory , via the uniform limit of eq .",
    "( [ pert2 ] ) . here",
    "the reference system free energy is very accurately approximated by the carnahan - starling excess free energy of the hs fluid  @xcite .",
    "for the perturbation , however , a mean field approximation is inappropriate , since the radial distribution function of the dense hs fluid is far more structured than that of the solid .",
    "therefore , instead of eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , we use the highly accurate verlet - weis fit to simulation data for the fluid function @xmath67 .      calculation of the free energy based on the approximate functional ( [ f ] ) requires , in practice , specification of the solid structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , the position vectors @xmath68 of the equilibrium atomic sites . here",
    "we consider three elementary crystal structures ( fcc , hcp , and bcc ) and , as a model of quasicrystalline structure , a sequence of rational approximants  @xcite .",
    "the fcc and bcc crystals are bravais lattices , characterized  in fact , defined  by equivalence of every lattice site  @xcite .",
    "the hcp structure , is composed of two interpenetrating simple - haxagonal bravais lattices or , equivalently , one simple - hexagonal lattice with a two - atom basis . the rational approximants are experimentally observed periodic crystals with large unit cells , whose structures realistically model the atomic ordering of certain known quasicrystals .",
    "their structures are described in detail in sec .",
    "iv a. for practical purposes , here we regard them as consisting of a simple - cubic bravais lattice together with a multi - atom basis .",
    "in addition to the positions of the atomic sites , the density distribution about the sites must in practice be specified . a particularly simple and widely adopted ansatz for the density distribution  @xcite places normalized isotropic gaussians at the sites of the solid , according to @xmath69 here the first sum is over the sites ( or unit cells ) of the underlying bravais lattice and the second is over the basis atoms , whose positions are described by displacements @xmath70 relative to the lattice sites .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 determines the width of the distribution and represents the single variational parameter with respect to which the free energy functional is minimized .",
    "the gaussian ansatz has been shown by simulation  @xcite and by numerical analysis  @xcite to yield a reasonably accurate approximation to the true density distribution in close - packed bravais crystals near melting , despite deviations in the detailed form of the distribution , and it has been widely and successfully used in diverse applications of classical df theory to thermodynamic properties of crystals  @xcite .",
    "implicit in eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) is the assumption that the distribution is identical about every site of the solid . while rigorously true of the bravais lattices , this assumption is not strictly valid for the other structures considered .",
    "although , in principle , a different variational width parameter could be assigned to each distinct site , or even free minimization could be performed  @xcite , in practice the associated numerical cost of multi - dimensional minimization would make prohibitive such an extensive survey of pair potentials , solid structures , and thermodynamic states as we undertake here . in any case , excepting the most open structures , the density distribution is expected to be isotropic and gaussian to within a reasonable approximation , as discussed in sec .",
    "v. thus , all of our free energy calculations make use of the gaussian ansatz ( [ gauss ] ) .    the density of any periodic solid may be represented as a fourier series of the general form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total volume and the sum is over the reciprocal lattice vectors ( rlv ) @xmath74 of the underlying bravais lattice . for the density defined by eq .",

    "( [ gauss ] ) ] by @xmath141 @xmath71 being the minimizing gaussian width parameter ; and ( _ iii _ ) the effective hs diameter @xmath50 , computed from eq .",

    "similarly , expanded fcc - al would occur at @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , were it not that at such low densities the fcc crystal is unstable ( see below ) .",
    "physical interpretation is greatly aided by considering the effective hs packing fraction , defined by @xmath148 . by default",
    ", the liquid is considered the stable phase when @xmath149 is so low that none of the solid structures is stable against thermally induced atomic displacements .",
    "( the states considered are well removed from the vapour phase . ) at sufficiently high @xmath149 , the close - packed fcc and hcp crystals tend to be thermodynamically stable , the minimizing hcp @xmath93 ratio lying close to , although usually slightly above , the ideal ratio . this is to be expected , since experience with the hs system indicates that strongly repulsive short - range interactions heavily favor packing efficiency .",
    "in contrast to the hs and lj systems , the fcc and hcp free energies are generally sufficiently different to clearly distinguish their relative stabilities , reflecting some influence of longer - range interactions .",
    "the more open bcc structure is always at best metastable , and thus appears nowhere in the stability tables . in these qualitative respects ,",
    "the simple metals do not differ significantly from the hs and lj systems .",
    "remarkably , however , in a relatively narrow band of parameter space , corresponding to intermediate effective packings , the rational approximants are predicted to be metastable or , in some cases , even _ thermodynamically _ stable .",
    "although this parameter range contains none of the elements from the periodic table , we note that it does include the virtual - crystal parameters ( average densities , valences , and core radii ) characteristic of some of the known multi - component s , p - bonded quasicrystals , _",
    "e.g. _ , al - mg - li , al(ga)-mg - zn , and al - li(mg)-cu .",
    "however , since these ternary alloys are composed of elements with atomic size ratios rather far from unity , the relevance of the simple virtual - crystal approximation must be considered doubtful .",
    "clearly , the size disparity of constituent elements constitutes an important element in the discussion of structural stabilities of alloys .",
    "this issue may be addressed by future extension of the df approach to multi - component metallic systems , for which purpose a generalization of the mwda to binary hs mixtures  @xcite may prove useful .",
    "we now turn to the physical reasons underlying the predicted thermodynamic stability of quasicrystalline structures . when the effective hs packing fraction is sufficiently low that the free energy functional has no variational minimum , the solid exhibits what we term a _",
    "phonon instability_. such unstable regions in the parameter space of tables  ii - iv are readily explained by considering trends in the effective hs diameter . in general , @xmath50 is seen to decrease with increasing valence ( across a row ) and with decreasing core radius ( down a column ) , in line with previous remarks regarding the core region of the pair potential ( see sec .",
    "ii ) . correspondingly , the atoms in the solid become more loosely packed and their density distributions broader , as reflected by the increasing lindemann ratio for a given structure . ultimately , when @xmath150 the atomic packing becomes so loose that the solid  whatever its structure  is no longer stable against vibrational displacements of the atoms away from their equilibrium sites ( phonons ) .",
    "the theory is thus consistent with the lindemann criterion for melting , according to which a solid becomes unstable when atomic displacements exceed roughly @xmath151 of the nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "significantly , the rational approximants , despite being less efficiently packed ( and thus having shorter nearest - neighbor distances ) than the crystals , have consistently smaller lindemann ratios .",
    "this implies greater vibrational stiffness , which tends to enhance their structural stability over that of the crystals . in passing ,",
    "we note that this may be related to certain mechanical and transport properties characteristic of many quasicrystals , such as high brittleness and low electrical and thermal conductivities .",
    "the phonon instability partly explains the appearance of the rational approximants near the table diagonals , where the crystals lose mechanical stability , and the absence of any stable structure towards the lower - right corner of the tables .",
    "it also accounts for the 1/1 metastability along the entire bottom row of table  iv , where all other structures are mechanically unstable .    where no entries are given in the stability tables , the free energy can not be evaluated within the theory for any of the structures considered .",
    "the reason is revealed by closer inspection of the effective hs diameter . in exception to the above - noted trend , @xmath50 can be anomalously large when the electron density is sufficiently high and @xmath12 sufficiently small .",
    "comparison with the pair potentials in fig .",
    "1 shows that this inflation of the effective hard core occurs precisely when the first minimum of the friedel oscillations happens to lie beneath the core , inducing a repulsive shoulder and pushing the first minimum of the pair potential out to larger distances .",
    "[ compare , for example , the diameter in table  ii at @xmath21 , @xmath152 with its counterpart pair potential in fig .  1 ( a ) .",
    "] when @xmath50 is so large , and @xmath14 so small , that the maximum hs packing fraction of a given solid structure ( table  i ) is exceeded , the repulsive core regions of nearest - neighbor atoms overlap at equilibrium separation .",
    "such an energetically unfavorable configuration exhibits what we term a _ packing instability_. in such cases , it proves impossible to find a self - consistent solution for the weighted density [ eq .",
    "( [ rhohat2 ] ) ] .",
    "the theory thus appropriately forbids such unphysical states .",
    "packing instability is a second reason for the loss of structural stability upon approaching the lower - right corner of tables  ii - iv , particularly at lower atomic volumes .",
    "of course there is some degree of arbitrariness in splitting the effective pair potential at the first , rather than the second , minimum .",
    "we note that at @xmath153 k the characteristic thermal energy @xmath154 mry is comparable to the barrier height , which justifies our choice of convention . for shouldered potentials ,",
    "however , the size of the effective hard core may be artificially inflated , resulting in a possible underestimate of quasicrystalline stability , particularly at higher densities .",
    "the analysis of structural trends across the periodic table  @xcite , as well as lattice - sum calculations  @xcite for a wide variety of crystal structures have shown that if the effective pair potential develops a shoulder at a distance close to the nearest - neighbor separation in a close - packed structure , a lattice distortion or finally the formation of a more open crystal structure becomes energetically favorable .",
    "characteristic examples falling within the parameter range covered by this study are the rhombohedral structure of hg ( @xmath127 , @xmath155 ) and the orthorhombic structure of @xmath71-ga ( @xmath129 , @xmath156 ) . at even higher valence",
    ", the same effect explains the transition from close - packed metallic to open covalent structures .",
    "covalency also entails three- and many - body forces , which are necessary to ensure the dynamic stability of the open structures .",
    "many - body forces , however , are clearly outside the scope of current pseudopotential and df theories .    to this point , we have explained the loss of mechanical stability in terms of phonon and packing instabilities . physical insight into the source of thermodynamic stability",
    "is gained by examining separately the reference and perturbation contributions to the total free energy .",
    "the reference free energy combines the entropy and that part of the internal energy that derives from short - range interactions , while the perturbation free energy is the remaining part of the internal energy deriving from medium- and long - range interactions .",
    "figure  3 compares the reference and perturbation free energies of the various structures as a function of @xmath11 for fixed chosen values of @xmath20 and @xmath14 .",
    "we emphasize that because of the ignored volume term ( see sec .",
    "iii ) only free energy _",
    "differences _ are physically relevant .",
    "that the reference free energy consistently favors the close - packed crystals is to be expected , since the reference system here is a hs solid .",
    "more revealing is that the perturbation free energy , although reinforcing the stability of the compact crystals at lower @xmath11 , increasingly disfavors them relative to the more open quasicrystals as z increases .",
    "this can be largely understood by noting that at lower @xmath11 , where the friedel oscillations are longer in wavelength , the first minimum of @xmath13 is relatively deep and coincides closely with the first nearest - neighbor distances of the highly - coordinated fcc and hcp structures . with increasing @xmath11",
    ", however , as the friedel oscillations shorten in wavelength and move under the repulsive core , the first minimum becomes shallower and shifts to shorter distances more commensurate with the first nearest - neighbor distances of the rational approximant structures ( cf .",
    "the discussion of relative stabilities of crystalline structures given by hafner and heine ( 1983 )  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the oscillating part of the effective pair potential clearly emerges as the source of thermodynamic stability of simple metallic quasicrystals .",
    "the actual order of stabilities depends on a detailed competition between reference and perturbation free energies or , equivalently , between strongly repulsive short - range and weaker medium - long - range interactions .",
    "the issue of structural stability may be framed alternatively in terms of a competition between internal energy @xmath157 and entropy @xmath158 .",
    "( for clarity , it should be noted that we do not consider here the role of phason entropy , since construction of the rational approximants does not involve the breaking of any matching rules . )",
    "whereas in the lattice - sum method  @xcite only @xmath157 is calculated , in the df approach both @xmath157 and @xmath158 may be separated from the free energy via the thermodynamic relations @xmath159 and @xmath160 we have numerically performed the separation and individually compared the resulting @xmath157 and @xmath158 for the different structures .",
    "we find in this way that entropy tends to favor the periodic crystals , whereas internal energy tends to favor the rational approximants .",
    "these tendencies , however , are not as decisive as those exhibited by the reference and perturbation free energies , respectively .",
    "thus , our df - perturbation theory approach demonstrates the utility of interpreting relative structural stabilities in terms of a competition between short- and medium - long - range interactions , as an alternative to the more conventional comparison of energy and entropy .",
    "furthermore , it indicates that even though entropic effects tend to favor close - packed structures , internal energy associated with longer - range interactions may still prevail in stabilizing quasicrystallinity .",
    "finally , we consider the temperature dependence of the relative stabilities . for an effective pair potential corresponding to a point near the diagonal of table  iii , fig .",
    "4 displays the free energy per particle as a function of temperature , at fixed average density , for three rational approximants ( 1/1 is unstable here ) and for the liquid . because the zero of the vertical scale is arbitrary , only free energy differences are physically meaningful . with decreasing temperature",
    ", one observes an inevitable liquid - solid transition .",
    "more interesting is that for this case a distinct cross - over in stability occurs between the different approximants . at higher temperatures , where short - range repulsive interactions dominate structural stability ,",
    "the more efficiently packed short - period 2/1 structure is most stable ( though metastable relative to the liquid ) . at lower temperatures ,",
    "medium- and long - range forces become more significant , ultimately stabilizing the long - period 5/3 structure .",
    "summarizing , we have applied a density - functional - based perturbation theory to the question of the thermodynamic stability of one - component crystals and rational approximant models of quasicrystals , interacting via effective metallic pair potentials derived from pseudopotential theory .",
    "the theory is based on a splitting of the pair potential into a strongly repulsive short - range part and a relatively weak oscillating tail and the variational minimization of an approximate free energy functional with respect to the gaussian - parametrized density distribution . comparing the free energies of several plausible solid structures over a range of pseudopotential parameters and thermodynamic states corresponding to simple metals",
    ", we have identified general trends in relative stabilities . with increasing electronic valence and decreasing core radius ,",
    "the solid becomes increasingly unstable towards atomic displacements as the atoms become more loosely packed . near electronic valences and core radii",
    "for which the close - packed crystals lose mechanical stability , the theory predicts thermodynamic stability of the vibrationally stiffer quasicrystalline structures .    some limitations of the theory should be emphasized .",
    "first , the df approach , because it requires prior specification of the solid structure , can not by itself predict the globally stable symmetry .",
    "it can , however , predict the relative stabilities of a set of prescribed structures .",
    "although our survey includes several of the more likely structures , it is conceivable that others not examined , or not treatable by the theory , may prove to be more stable .",
    "in particular , df theory can not describe freezing into the more open crystal structures ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath71,@xmath161-hg , @xmath71-ga , @xmath71,@xmath162-sn ) appearing close to the transition from metals to semimetals and semiconductors . in these materials ,",
    "the liquid is always more metallic than the solid , violating a basic assumption of df theory that the interatomic potentials do not change at the transition .",
    "the important point , however , is that in the lower - right half of tables  ii - iv the stability of the quasicrystalline structures will be limited by the higher stability of comparatively open and at least partially covalent structures .",
    "we can locate the transition by drawing a line between the points representing hg and ga .",
    "this line coincides approximately with the limits of stability of the quasicrystalline approximants ( again in good agreement with the lattice - sum calculations ) .",
    "hence , our conclusions are not affected by this limitation .",
    "second , convergence of the perturbation expansion at first - order [ eq . [ pert2 ] ] is not ensured down to arbitrarily low temperatures . in principle , convergence can be established by comparing the first - order contribution with the residual contribution due to neglected higher - order terms .",
    "( note that the relative magnitudes of reference and perturbation free energies do not necessarily reflect the degree of convergence . )",
    "of course in practice , the higher - order terms are unknown . as noted in sec .",
    "iii a , however , they are proportional to fluctuations in the total perturbation energy and to successively higher powers of @xmath163 . in general ,",
    "if the change in @xmath66 relative to @xmath47 is sufficiently small over distances within which the single - particle density of the solid ( or radial distribution function of the liquid ) is significant , then these terms can be safely neglected . for the temperatures and average densities of interest here ,",
    "the solid density distributions ( and peaks in the liquid radial distribution functions ) are so narrow that the first - order approximation is expected to be rather accurate . as a typical example , consider the case of fig .",
    "1a for @xmath164 . from table ii , at @xmath133",
    "the stable structure is the fcc crystal with lindemann ratio @xmath165 .",
    "the variation of @xmath66 at the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath166 over the relevant distance @xmath167 is considerably smaller than @xmath154 mry , indicating good convergence .",
    "caution is naturally advised , however , in extension of the first - order approximation to significantly lower temperatures .",
    "third , the assumption of a single - parameter isotropic gaussian density distribution is certainly of restricted validity , especially for very anisotropic structures .",
    "the close - packed crystals are known to be reasonably isotropic and gaussian  @xcite . for the relatively open eight - fold coordinated bcc crystal , on the other hand",
    ", the isotropic assumption should not be particularly accurate , especially near the melting transition .",
    "quasicrystals and their higher - order approximants , however , are known to be elastically isotropic  @xcite and also to exhibit isotropic dispersion relations of accoustic phonons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their relatively narrow density distributions ( small lindemann ratios ) tend to minimize the significance of any deviations from gaussian form .",
    "hence , an isotropic gaussian distribution should be rather accurate for these structures . in any case",
    ", the incorporation of additional degrees of freedom into a more flexible and realistic density parametrization would only result in _ increasing _ the stability of the rational approximants .",
    "such technical refinements to the theory therefore should not qualitatively change our conclusions .",
    "lattice - sum studies  @xcite , based on ground - state energy calculations , gave the first intriguing indication of _ energetically _ stable one - component metallic quasicrystals at zero temperature , but left open the issue of thermodynamic stability at finite temperatures .",
    "previous df studies of hard - sphere systems  @xcite effectively ruled out vibrational and configurational entropy as the source of quasicrystal stability , but did not consider the role of longer - range interactions .",
    "using a practical df - perturbation approach , we have now directly addressed these issues , and in the process demonstrated that the remarkable lattice - sum predictions carry over to finite temperatures .",
    "furthermore , our approach yields new physical insight by explaining the stability of quasicrystals in terms of their enhanced vibrational stiffness and the stabilizing influence of medium- and long - range interactions .",
