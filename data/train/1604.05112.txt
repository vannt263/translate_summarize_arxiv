    "the motion of a charged particle evolving in a complex magnetic field is investigated with magnetized plasma confinement in mind .",
    "this problem is a long standing issue with many studies , most of them relying on guiding center and gyrokinetic reductions @xcite .",
    "these reductions typically rely on a separation of scales both in space and time .",
    "for instance , one assumes that a spatial scale of the cyclotron motion , the larmor radius @xmath1 , is small enough compared with the characteristic scale @xmath2 of the electromagnetic field , and that the cyclotron frequency is much higher than any other characteristic frequency in the plasma @xcite . in the guiding center theory , the degrees of freedom in a configurational space are reduced by averaging over a gyroperiod , the degree of freedom corresponding to the gyrophase is wiped out .",
    "the conjugate of the gyrophase is the magnetic moment , and it becomes an adiabatic invariant . in the gyrokinetic approach ,",
    "gyrokinetic coordinates are introduced starting from the guiding center coordinates as a first order approximation , eventually through for instance the use of a lie - transform method@xcite , it as well assumes that the newly obtained magnetic moment @xmath3 becomes an invariant@xcite .",
    "thus , the dimension of the original system is reduced and in principle the integration gets to be easier , most notably the computational effort to perform realistic kinetic simulations of the plasma is greatly reduced , and becomes accessible to current accessible computing facilities .",
    "this explains why many studies on magnetized plasmas are based on numerical codes that integrate up to some accuracies the gyrokinetic equations .    on the other hand",
    ", the increased computing power allows us as well to integrate and investigate long time particle trajectories with small time slice compared with the cyclotron motion , and reach for instance the adiabatic time scales , and this is the approach we consider in this paper . to be more specific",
    ", we shall consider the motion of a charged particle in a fixed external magnetic field , and deal with the case in which the assumption of the guiding center theory breaks down .",
    "similar phenomena have been discussed by landsman _",
    "@xcite , and more recently by cambon _",
    "_ @xcite .    in this",
    "setting we can exhibit some potentially physical relevant effect beyond gyrokinetic or guiding center reductions .",
    "for instance , recently pfefferl _",
    "et al._@xcite have found that there exists a case where the full trajectory and the trajectory obtained from guiding center reduction are completely different from each other even though the gradient of the magnetic field is @xmath4 . in the same vein , cambon _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite study the full orbit effects of charged particle motion in a magnetic field in toroidal and cylindrical geometry without any assumptions of invariance of the magnetic moment .",
    "signature of hamiltonian chaos in phase space was clearly exhibited , even when the magnetic field is toroidally symmetric .",
    "this effect is enhanced when a non - generic ripple effect that has no radial element and keeps field lines integrable is introduced . in the chaotic regions ,",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath5 is no longer a constant of motion , and the basic assumptions of the gyrokinetic theory or guiding center theory breaks down . in order to observe the chaotic motion ,",
    "a naive poincar plot based on spatial periodicity is unconvincing .",
    "indeed , the larmor gyration blurs the poincar plot , and we can not really conclude on whether or not the motion is chaotic . in cambon _ et al._@xcite , poincar plots were taken for each time when @xmath6 or when @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the time average .",
    "further , they also considered that the hamiltonian @xmath10 of the toroidal system with radius @xmath11 consists of the cylinder part @xmath12 corresponding to the infinite toroidal radius and the perturbation part @xmath13 corresponding to a finite curvature .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath12 is conserved when @xmath14 , and oscillates when @xmath15 .",
    "then poincar plots are taken on the iso-@xmath12 set , and the chaos induced with the toroidal geometry are shown . in this paper , we consider at first the same problem but in a different geometry , namely a purely cylindrical one .",
    "the onset of chaos being triggered by introducing gradually a perturbation in the magnetic field .",
    "this allows us to investigate even more the complex relationship between the chaos of field lines and particle motion . as a consequence of this we examine the feasibility of setting upon internal transport barrier ( itb)@xcite using given magnetic configurations .    to be more specific , of particular interest to the present paper",
    "is the study of the role of finite larmor radius effects in reversed shear magnetic fields , that is , magnetic configurations with non - monotonic @xmath0-profiles known to exhibit itbs .",
    "the formation of itb is a complex , not fully understood process involving several physics mechanics .",
    "however , at the heart of this problem there is a fundamental hamiltonian dynamical systems problem related to the perturbation of degenerate hamiltonian systems with the hamiltonian @xmath16 . in the standard ( non - degenerate ) case , integrable hamiltonians",
    "exhibit a monotonic dependence on the action . in the one - dimensional case",
    ", this implies that the derivative of the unperturbed frequency with respect to the action , @xmath17 , never vanishes . in @xmath18-dimensions",
    "this property involves the hessian of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are actions .",
    "the key issue is that the standard kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem@xcite , as well as many other powerful mathematical results that determine the fate of integrable hamiltonians , assume that the hamiltonian is not degenerate .",
    "however , as originally discussed in ref .",
    "there are important , physically relevant problems described by degenerate hamiltonian systems including transport in non - monotonic shear flows @xcite and magnetic chaos in reversed shear configurations @xcite . in the latter case , the degeneracy",
    "is directly linked to the non - monotonicity of the @xmath0-profile . in particular , as it is well - known , in the hamiltonian description of magnetic fields , the flux , @xmath21 , plays the role of the action variable , and the unperturbed frequency , which corresponds to the poloidal transit frequency , is given by @xmath22 . in this case , the destruction of shearless kam surfaces , which corresponding to the destruction of itb located where @xmath0 exhibits a minimum , is a problem outside the range of applicability of the standard kam theory , and extended theories for non - twist ( degenerate ) systems@xcite are necessary .",
    "the fate of shearless kam tori in generic degenerate hamiltonian systems was first studied in ref . , where its was shown that there are two processes at play .",
    "one is separatrix reconnection that involves a change in the topology of the iso - contours of the hamiltonian and the other is the remarkable resilience of shearless tori due to the anomalous scaling of the higher - order islands forming in the vicinity of the shearless point ( e.g. , minimum of the @xmath0-profile ) .",
    "these two processes , separatrix reconnection and resilience of shearless kam curves , have been studied in significant detail in the context of the dynamics of magnetic field line orbits . however , to the best of our knowledge , the present paper is the first systematic study of the impact of these processes in the full particle orbits . in particular , we are interested in the study of how the topology of the full orbits changes as a result of the changes in the magnetic field topology in reversed shear configurations . also , we are interested in the study the relationship between the robustness of magnetic flux surfaces near the minimum of the @xmath0-profile ( i.e. magnetic field itbs ) and the robustness of full particle orbits transport barriers ( i.e. particles itbs ) .    given these aforementioned facts , the paper consists in two different specific parts .",
    "in the first part , we investigate the motion of particles in a configuration when field lines are integrable . in this setting the poincar plots are taken on the iso-(angular ) momentum set .",
    "one consequence of the existence of chaotic region is that there is no global third integral corresponding to the magnetic moment .",
    "it is thus important to look into this kind of chaos for checking validity of global gyrokinetic reductions and for estimation of error coming from the reductions .",
    "in the second part , we focus on the relation between the magnetic field line and the particle trajectory , which are closely related . roughly speaking ,",
    "the `` zeroth '' approximation of the guiding center reduction is along the magnetic field line .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to compare both the particle trajectory and the magnetic field line , when the particle trajectory is chaotic while the magnetic field line is regular .",
    "when the magnetic field lines become chaotic this issue remains , however in this setting the poincar sections on the iso-@xmath5 set or iso - angular momentum sets are not suitable anymore , one reason being that for instance we can not define a single common section to represent the particle trajectory and the magnetic field line . to circumvent this problem , we propose a method using some periodic average of the trajectory in the vicinity of the magnetic section .",
    "this method allows us to compare the particle trajectory and the magnetic field line on the same poincar section .",
    "the result that we find is that in the regular field , we see a particle trajectory that is roughly regular , but the shape of the trajectory is completely different from the magnetic field line . another peculiar effect that we pinpoint",
    "is that there exists a region in which `` regular '' particle trajectories are found but the magnetic field line is chaotic .",
    "this means that an itb can be created in a chaotic magnetic field at least for a certain population of particles with some given energies . to be more specific ,",
    "we find that the particles can move in the chaotic magnetic region almost randomly , but they can not cross some specific region of phase space , they are trapped in a given region implying that an itb exists .    in order to introduce jointly the two considered questions we have organized the paper as follows .",
    "first , in sec . [",
    "sec : model ] , we introduce the setting that we deal with .",
    "the reduced single particle hamiltonian for the unperturbed integrable part is derived , and we used a more general formalism than what was proposed in ref . .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : poincare ] , we introduce and detail the two different methods in order to visualize the particles motion and compute numerically poincar sections , for the two considered problems .",
    "we then move on to the actual obtained results in sec .",
    "[ sec : motion ] and discuss the motion of the charged particle .",
    "more specifically , in sec .",
    "[ sec : chaos - in - regular ] , the existence of chaotic motion in a regular magnetic field is presented , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : regular - in - chaos ] , the motion of the particles in a chaotic magnetic field and the problems related to the creation of itb are considered .",
    "finally we conclude .",
    "in this section we introduce the relevant parameters of the considered system and how we have dealt with it . as mentioned before",
    ", we consider the motion of a charged particle in a given static magnetic field @xmath23 .",

    "let @xmath21 denote the poloidal magnetic flux of the unperturbed part , we have @xmath54 .",
    "we can associate @xmath21 and the poloidal angle @xmath55 as canonically conjugated variables , and the @xmath44 coordinates acts as the `` time . ''",
    "we then get the equation of the field line given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "we recall that in the zeroth order approximation , a charged particle moves along the field line on average .",
    "the dynamics of a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath58 where we have normalized the mass and the charge of the particle to 1 , and @xmath59 denotes the euclidean norm in @xmath60 space .",
    "taking the legendre transformation , we have the lagrangian , @xmath61 where the upper - dots denote the time derivative , @xmath62 , and the center - dot denotes the scalar - product in @xmath60 .",
    "for the considered magnetic configuration as @xmath63 in what follows we examine the invariants of the motion for two cases ; unperturbed motion @xmath64 , and perturbation with one mode , i.e. @xmath65 for only one @xmath66 .",
    "perturbations involving several modes will be addressed in a future paper .      when the parameter @xmath67 , @xmath55 and @xmath44 are cyclic and the conjugate momenta , the angular momentum around the @xmath44-axis , @xmath68 and the translation momentum along the @xmath44-axis , @xmath69 are invariants .",
    "further , due to the time translational symmetry , the energy function @xmath70 is also an invariant of motion .",
    "thus , there exist three integrals of motion and the unperturbed motion is completely integrable .",

    "regarding the field lines , they remain integrable . indeed looking at eq .",
    ", the change of variable @xmath88 corresponds to a galilean transformation which transforms the non autonomous equation into an autonomous one .",

    "the function @xmath103 is written as @xmath104 which allows to kill the perturbation outside of the cylinder ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "since the trajectory lies in a six dimensional phase space , it is difficult to clearly visualize the full trajectory . in order to circumvent this problem",
    ", we make poincar plots on a two dimensional subset , which is relatively simple for the field lines , but is however rather complex for the full particle orbit .",
    "indeed , one could naively consider identical section for the field lines and the particles , meaning section on the planes @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "however , due to the larmor gyration , the particle trajectory becomes thick even when the particle motion is completely integrable .",
    "this larmor gyration blurs the details of the particle motion and makes these more or less useless . in what follows ,",
    "we discuss two methods to `` suppress '' the thickness of the trajectory and alleviate the problem .",
    "as mentioned before , without perturbation , the motion is integrable .",
    "however , when only one mode is present , only two constants of motion exist . in this setting , we choose the poincar section on the invariant sets of the variables which are integrals in the unperturbed system but not in the perturbed system , for example , the angular momentum around @xmath44-axis @xmath71 , the momentum @xmath72 , the effective hamiltonian @xmath75 [ eq . ] , and the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian , @xmath108 . in this paper we settled on using the iso-@xmath71 plane . as will be shown",
    ", this method is successful in visualizing the presence of chaos generated by the slow motion of the separatrix in the @xmath109 phase space .",
    "however , it is then difficult to relate it to the field lines and we can not compare the charged particle motion with the magnetic field line profile using this strategy .      to visualize the dynamics , even in the absence of constants of motions ( except for the energy ) , we resort to use an averaging like method to perform a section .",
    "as will be shown this allows us to get rid of the `` blurriness '' induced by the larmor gyration .",
    "however , we anticipate that the method may have some caveats if one considers extremely long time , and when slow adiabatic chaos is present . despite this",
    ", this method allows us to get a good idea of the regularity of the motion , at least for the considered simulation time , and none of the techniques used in the context of the regular magnetic field proved to be adequate .",
    "one other advantage is that this allows a more visual comparison between particle motion and the magnetic configuration .",
    "as mentioned , in order to compare with magnetic field , we consider a similar section as the one performed for the field lines , i.e. we want to make a `` poincar '' section for each time when @xmath44 reaches @xmath110 .",
    "this will work for non energetic particles with small larmor radii , however when the energy will be increased finite size larmor effects will end up `` blurring '' the section making it impossible to decipher wether or not the motion is regular or chaotic .",
    "this is why , we used the averaging technique . in order to be more explicit , we present below the details of the numerical procedure we used in order to perform this specific section .",
    "let us now detail the averaging procedure .",
    "we note @xmath111 the time step in the numerical integration .",
    "the crossing of the section plane will occur when @xmath112 , and thus around a time @xmath113 such that @xmath114 satisfies @xmath115 .",
    "it is within a time slice of this crossing that we perform a time average over one larmor period .",
    "the number of time steps @xmath116 occurring during one larmor gyration is approximately the integer part of @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the cyclotoronic period .",
    "we thus compute numerically the @xmath119 points of the particle trajectory @xmath120 for @xmath121 , after crossing the section plane , meaning when @xmath122 .",
    "we then transport each point @xmath123 back on the section plane at @xmath124 along the magnetic field line that passes through @xmath123 .",
    "we obtain then the corresponding images @xmath125 on the section @xmath126 .",
    "in fact in order to compute numerically the points @xmath127 , we do a first order approximation .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field @xmath23 depends smoothly on @xmath128 , and that @xmath129 is not so far from @xmath124 .",
    "so to obtain the @xmath127 , we simply project @xmath130 to the section along tangent lines of the magnetic field @xmath23 at @xmath130 .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp1 ] .",
    "all the image points are on the section plane plane @xmath131 , and we can write them in cartesian coordinates as @xmath132 , and the projection along the filed like yields numerically that @xmath133 and @xmath134 are given respectively by @xmath135 to get the final position of our section we perform an average , meaning in the poincar sections of the particle motion that we present with the chaotic magnetic field , we plot the average points @xmath136 that are obtained by @xmath137 on each plane @xmath131 .",
    "as already mentioned using this average we were able to transform a naively obtained `` blurry '' trajectory on the plane @xmath131 into a trajectory with a much better resolution ( when motion is integrable or quasi - integrable on the considered time scales ) .",
    "roughly speaking we are making a pseudo - reduction : the equation of motion are rigorously numerically solved , but we perform an average similar to the gyro - average only when we take the poincar plot . the illustrative explanation is exhibited in fig .",

    "in this section we study the chaotic motion in an integrable magnetic field , and investigate the influence of the kinetic energy and initial pitch angle on the topology of particle trajectories .",
    "in particular , we show that a `` regular '' region that acts as an effective transport barrier can appear in a region in which the magnetic field lines are chaotic .",
    "since we are computing long - time trajectories resolving the larmor gyration , the equations of motion are integrated using a sixth order implicit symplectic gauss - legendre method @xcite .",

    "however , when the pitch angle is large , the shape of particle trajectories seems to be independent on the energy .",
    "this is because the ratio of the unperturbed part and the perturbed part in the lorentz force is not so drastically changed when the energy increases unlike the first case .",
    "qualitative investigations on the large finite larmor radius effect appear to be necessary .",
    "we showed that even though magnetic barrier is destroyed , the itb actually remained effective for a given energy range of the particles . on the one hand",
