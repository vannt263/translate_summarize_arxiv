    "thanks to the increasing number of statistical studies of both local and distant galaxies , it has been possible to reveal and confirm several correlations in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "one of these relations is the so - called star formation main sequence ( sfms ) of actively star forming galaxies , which relates the star formation rate ( sfr , @xmath1 ) and the stellar mass ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the sfms is an approximately linear correlation between log@xmath1 and log@xmath10 , that has been observed in the local universe as well as at high redshifts .",
    "see for example : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( hearafter rp15 ) for @xmath11 , @xcite for @xmath12 and @xcite ( hearafter d07 ) for @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , @xcite ( hearafter s14 ) performed a compilation of sfms relations reported in the literature and shows a summary of the evolutionary behaviour of the sfms with redshift ( up to @xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xcite performed a similar study of the evolution of this correlation for @xmath16 .",
    "the sfms is also recovered in cosmological simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hearafter s15 ) .",
    "in fact , this correlation has been proven to be tight , with a scatter of @xmath17 dex in observations and in theoretical predictions ( d07 , s15 , s14 ) .",
    "the values of the slope and zero points for the sfms may vary within a large range in the literature ( see s14 for a compilation ) .",
    "it has been proposed that this variations may originate from the selection criteria used to select star forming galaxies .",
    "rp15 has proposed a new objective definition for the sfms for local galaxies , which favours values of 0.76 dex and -7.64 log(m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) for the slope and zero points respectively .    although the physical distinction between star - forming and passive galaxies is not straightforward ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sfms correlation provides a convenient way to classify galaxies in terms of their sf properties . generally , the star - forming galaxies lie on the main sequence , red elliptical galaxies tend to lie below the relation , while the starburst galaxies , lie above the sequence ( s15 ) .",
    "all previous sfms studies have been done , using integrated quantities for the galaxies .",
    "due to observational restrictions , the derivation of quantities like sfr and m@xmath18 have been performed using , for example , single fiber spectroscopy affected by aperture losses that need to be corrected .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) allow to have spatial and spectroscopical information for extended objects , as it delivers individual spectra for each point of the observed target ( restricted to the instrument spatial resolution ) , which makes ifs a suitable observational technique to study of spatially - resolved physical quantities in galaxies .",
    "studying the sfms with ifs would allow to obtain both , integrated and local correlations .",
    "if the field of view covers the entire optical extension of the galaxy , these data are not affected by aperture losses .",
    "ifs when used to perform sky surveys , allows to do statistical studies of spatially - resolved physical quantities of galaxies .",
    "the calar alto legacy integral field area survey califa , @xcite is an ongoing extragalactic optical ifs survey , designed to observe around @xmath19 galaxies , which makes it suitable to perform spatially - resolved studies with statistical significance .",
    "we present the results of studying the spatially - resolved sfms based on data from the califa survey . throughout this paper",
    "we have adopted a salpeter imf and a cosmology defined by : h@xmath20= 71 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath21=0.7 and a flat universe .",
    "we used the available sample observed by until february 2015 , consisting of 535 galaxies that are representative of its mother sample ( * ? ? ? * mass and redshift ranges are @xmath22 m@xmath3 and @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 respectively ) , which includes galaxies of all morphological types , inclinations and environments .",
    "galaxies from califa extended sample observed as ancillary programs , i.e. galaxies not contemplated in the original mother sample , were also included .",
    "for this reason the @xmath10 of some of the galaxies in our sample may be lower than the limits established on the mother sample . in order to avoid inclination effects",
    ", we clipped our sample to a low inclination ( @xmath26 ) galaxies subsample with @xmath27 60@xmath28 , for which 306 galaxies remained .",
    "the observations were performed using the pmas instrument @xcite in the ppak configuration @xcite .",
    "the observing strategy guarantees a complete coverage of the spatial extension of the galaxies up to 2.5 effective radius , with a fwhm@xmath29 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath30 kpc at the average redshift of the survey ( for further information of the survey , sample and observational strategy see : * ? ? ?",
    "* )    we used data from the v500 setup that covers a wavelength range of @xmath31 to @xmath32 @xmath33 , with a nominal resolution of @xmath34= @xmath35 at @xmath36 @xmath33 .",
    "the datacubes were provided by version 1.5 of the pipeline @xcite , and consist of a regular grid of  72@xmath3778 spectra , with a 1\" / spaxel size centred in the galaxies .",
    "the datacubes were analysed using the pipe3d pipeline @xcite , which is a tool that fits the continuum with stellar population models and measures the nebular emission lines .",
    "this pipeline is based on the fit3d fitting tool @xcite . for this particular implementation",
    "we adopted the gsd156 library of simple stellar population models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cf13 ) , that comprises 156 templates covering 39 stellar ages ( from 1myr to 13gyr ) , and 4 metallicities ( @xmath38 0.2 , 0.4 , 1 , and 1.5 ) .",
    "this templates have been extensively used within the califa collaboration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "details of the fitting procedure , dust attenuation curve , and uncertainties of the process are given in @xcite .",
    "we applied a spatial binning to each datacube to reach an homogenous s / n of 50 across the field of view .",
    "then , the stellar population fitting was applied to the coadded spectra within each spatial bin . finally , following the procedures described in cf13 and snchez et al .",
    "2015b , we derive the stellar - population model for each spaxel by re - scaling the best fitted model within each spatial bin to the continuum flux intensity in the corresponding spaxel .",
    "the stellar - population model is then substracted to create a gas - pure cube comprising only the ionised gas emission lines .",
    "thus it is assumed the same m / l ratio and dust attenuation for those spaxels within the same spatial - bin , to derive a spaxel - wise map of any stellar property , like the @xmath10 surface density ( @xmath39 ) .    for the gas - pure cube ,",
    "the strongest emission lines within the considered wavelength range , including h@xmath40 and h@xmath41 are fitted spaxel - by - spaxel to derive their corresponding flux intensity and equivalent width ( ew ) maps . the h@xmath40 flux is then corrected by the ionised gas dust attenuation , derived using the balmer decrement assuming a canonical value of 2.86 , adopting a @xcite extinction law and @xmath42 .",
    "the h@xmath40 luminosity distribution is derived by correcting for the cosmological distance and , by applying the @xcite conversion from h@xmath40 luminosity to sfr we derive both the integrated sfrs and the spaxel - wise distribution of the sfr surface density ( @xmath43sfr ) .",
    "the measured @xmath43sfr and @xmath39 have not been corrected for galaxy inclination . however , since we have limited our sample to galaxies with @xmath27 60@xmath28 , the impact of inclination on the projected surface densities will be less than a factor of two .",
    "the procedure described in section [ sfr ] was applied to the 306 galaxies mentioned in section [ data ] to construct the sfms relation for the califa sample .",
    "vs.sfr relation for the califa sample .",
    "green symbols represent galaxies that lie above the kewley limit ( kl ) and whose h@xmath40 equivalent widths ( ew ) are @xmath44 6@xmath33 , i.e. are galaxies whose ionisation emission is dominated by the agn activity .",
    "blue symbols represent galaxies below the kl and with ew(h@xmath40 ) @xmath44 6@xmath33 , and that have inclinations @xmath45 60@xmath28 , i.e. that lie in the star formation main sequence ( sfms ) .",
    "red symbols represent galaxies with ew(h@xmath40 ) @xmath45 3@xmath33 , i.e. that lie in a retired galaxies sequence ( rgs ) .",
    "finally black symbols account for galaxies whose ew(h@xmath40 ) lie between 3@xmath33 and 6@xmath33 , i.e. galaxies whose dominant ionisation process is uncertain .",
    "shaped symbols hold for galaxies in the low inclination subsample , that are the ones used for the rest of the analysis , however for completeness , the points show the complementary high inclination subsample .",
    "blue and red lines are the linear fittings to the sfms for low inclined galaxies and rgs respectively ( see table [ table1 ] for details ) . sfrs shown in the plot only hold for the sf dominated galaxies , for the rest these rates are only the result of the linear transformation of the h@xmath40 luminosities with the @xcite relation . for further details of the galaxies classification",
    "please refer to section 4.1.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    figure [ fig : sfrvsmas_int ] , shows the integrated @xmath10 vs. sfr relation that was constructed integrating the corresponding spatially - resolved quantities of all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "preliminary versions of this plot for smaller subsamples of the califa data have been already presented in @xcite and @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfrvsmas_int ] we classify the dominant ionisation source in the galaxies based on a combination of ews(h@xmath40 ) classification , introduced by @xcite and a classification using the kewley demarcation limit ( kl ) @xcite in the baldwin - phillips - terlevich ( bpt ) diagram @xcite : ( i ) the green symbols account for galaxies for which the [ ] /h@xmath41 and [ ] /h@xmath40 line ratios of their integrated ionised gas emission lines lie above the kl and whose ew(h@xmath40 ) are @xmath46 6@xmath33 , meaning that the dominant ionisation process in these galaxies comes from the nuclear activity .",
    "( ii ) the blue symbols represent the galaxies that lie below the kl in the bpt diagram , and whose ew(h@xmath40 ) are @xmath46 6@xmath33 , which means that the ionisation processes in these galaxies are dominated by sf , as it is shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the red symbols account for galaxies whose ew(h@xmath40 ) are @xmath47 3@xmath33 regardless of their position in the bpt diagram , meaning that most probably the dominant processes in the gas ionisation come from an old stellar population @xcite .",
    "( iv ) finally , black symbols represent galaxies whose ew(h@xmath40 ) are : 3@xmath33 @xmath47 ew",
    "@xmath47 6@xmath33 , which means that their main ionisation process remain uncertain . shaped symbols account for the galaxies from the low @xmath26 subsample , that are the ones used for the rest of the analysis .",
    "for completeness , points show the galaxies for the complementary high @xmath26 subsample .",
    "although , we have transformed the h@xmath40 luminosities to sfrs for all the galaxies adopting the @xcite relation , we should clarify that the interpretation of sfrs is only valid for galaxies ( and regions ) that are ionised by young stars ( following our previous criteria ) .",
    "for the rest of the galaxies , the sfrs presented in the plot are indeed just a linear transformation of the h@xmath40 luminosity .    for the star - forming and retired galaxies sequences ( blue and red respectively ) , which , from now on will be referred to as sfms and retired galaxies sequence ( rgs ) , we have fitted linear correlations between log@xmath48 and log@xmath49 whose characteristics are listed in table [ table1 ] , along with their dispersions .",
    "the slope and zero point for the sfms are in good agreement with the values reported in the literature for local galaxies ( rp15 , s14 and references therein . for further details see section 5 ) . for the black and green points no further analysis was performed due to the uncertain main ionisation process of the gas and due to its poor statistics , respectively .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the uncertainties of the derived quantities are dominated by the spectrophotometric accuracy of the califa data , which is estimated to be @xmath506@xmath51 @xcite , as well as the details of the procedure followed to derive the @xmath10 and the sfrs . in the case of @xmath10",
    "it has been determined that the uncertainties are well constrained within a typical error of @xmath500.15 dex , ( see e.g. the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the typical size of the uncertainties for our data are shown in figure [ fig : sfrvsmas_int ] , which are consistent with what has been previously found by @xcite and @xcite , and were taken into account when computing the linear fitting .",
    "next we explore the spatially - resolved sfms for the califa sample , by plotting the sfr surface density versus the @xmath10 surface density in figure [ fig : sfrvsmas ] .",
    "the individual spaxels used in constructing the relation have spatial scales of 0.5 - 1.5 kpc which are larger than typical hii region sizes ( hundreds of parsecs ) @xcite .",
    "it was derived using only the spaxels that fulfil the same criteria of the blue points in figure [ fig : sfrvsmas_int ] , irrespective of the location of its host galaxy in that figure .",
    "indeed , 11@xmath51 of the included spaxels comes from galaxies for which the global ionisation is not dominated by sf ( i.e. , not blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrvsmas_int ] ) .     of the total data presented in the plot .",
    "further contours holds 60@xmath51 , 40@xmath51 and 20@xmath51 of the total amount of data in the plot .",
    "yellow line represents the linear fitting to the spatially - resolved sfms relation using the 80@xmath51 of the data ( see table [ table1 ] for further details of the linear fitting).,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    a density plot of the local sfms , based on 90,786 individual spectra , is shown in figure [ fig : sfrvsmas ] .",
    "colors account for the density of data points , and the yellow line represents a linear fitting to the correlation using only the 80@xmath51 of the data , corresponding to the data contained inside the largest contour in the density plot which corresponds to the linear regime of the data .",
    "however in table [ table1 ] we present the results of the fitting using both , 100@xmath51 and 80@xmath51 of the data .",
    "the fitting was performed using variable mass bins which individually contain 1@xmath51 of the total amount of data and shows that the spatially - resolved sfms relation holds in general , as a linear relation .",
    "uncertainties in this plot are not shown , but were taken into account in the computation of the linear fitting and are reflected in the errors of the slope and zero point of the correlation .",
    "the spatially - resolved sfms proves to be a tight correlation , as the standard deviation ( @xmath52 ) is quite small @xmath52 = 0.23 dex , comparable to the value obtained for the integrated relation , in this work and previous independent studies ( see for example : d07 , s14 , s15 ) .",
    "in section 4.1 we explored the tight correlation between the sfr ( inferred from h@xmath40 luminosity ) and the total @xmath10 for star - forming ( sfms ) and retired ( rgs ) galaxies , in logarithmic scales . in the case of the integrated sfms the slope and zero point",
    "( see table [ table1 ] ) are in good agreement with the previously reported values .",
    "even if the range of variation of reported slopes and zero points in the literature may be as large as @xmath53 for the slope and @xmath54 for the zero points for local galaxies ( s14 ) , many recent works tend to constrain these values to smaller ranges , such as @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even more , published dispersions of this relation ( @xmath17 dex ) , are in good agreement with the dispersion found with our data ( 0.20 dex ) .",
    "in section 4.2 we presented the spatially - resolved sfms relation .",
    "the observed correlation holds on kpc scales , and is consistent with the slope of 0.66 @xmath57 reported by @xcite for hii regions . comparing the integrated and the spatially - resolved relations ,",
    "our results ( summarised in table [ table1 ] ) indicate that not only the slopes , but also the intrinsic scatter , are roughly of the same order in both relations .",
    "we explored the local relation in different @xmath10 bins , finding that it has no dependence with this parameter .",
    "we fitted linear correlations to each mass bin relation , and used a 2d kolmogorv - smirnov test to verify that the spatially - resolved sfms present the same distribution irrespective of the mass of the host galaxy , however we will explore this in more detail in further works .",
    "we also explored the possible effects in the local sfms determination , relaxing our criteria to select the sf regions by allowing the regions laying below the kl and whose ew(h@xmath40 ) are @xmath47 3 to be considered also as sf regions . from this test we found that for both relations",
    ", using the 100@xmath51 and 80@xmath51 of the data the slope vary just @xmath500.04 dex , i.e. it has a little impact in our results .    from a physical point of view",
    ", we know that sf is a local process , and therefore it is not unreasonable that the scaling relations governing it are local as well . the fact that the sfms relation remains as a tight linear correlation on kpc scales suggests that the conversion of gas into stars is mainly driven by local rather than global processes .    a local sfms could only be derived from the global one if the spatial distribution of both the @xmath43sfr and @xmath39 followed similar patterns in all galaxies .",
    "given the variations in the shape and normalization of these observed profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* gonzlez delgado et al . , in preparation ) , it seems rather fine - tuned that a mechanism acting on the scale of the whole galaxy affects both surface densities exactly in the way required to yield a universal relation on resolved scales without a local process being involved .    to recover the global relation from the local one we just need to integrate the resolved quantities across the whole area of the galaxy . in terms of the stellar mass surface density @xmath58 at the half - light radius @xmath59 , the total stellar mass should roughly scale as @xmath60 .",
    "if the star formation surface density fulfils @xmath61 at every point ( i.e. a local sfms with logarithmic slope @xmath62 ) , one obtains the integrated relation @xmath1 @xmath63 . since @xmath64 with @xmath65 ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the logarithmic slope of the integrated sfms would be @xmath66 if it was a consequence of the local relation .",
    "if equation  ( [ eq_alpha ] ) holds , @xmath67 implies that the integrated sfms should be slightly steeper than the local relation , in rough agreement with the results reported in table  1 .",
    "it must be noted , though , that this prediction is only valid if @xmath60 , which is merely a first - order approximation .",
    "moreover , the measured value of the logarithmic slope @xmath40 is rather sensitive to the sample selection criteria ( inclination , ew threshold , etc . ) , and we have to keep in mind that the galaxies used in the integrated relation , even if they were selected for being dominated by the sf activity , may contain local zones that are not star - forming .",
    "we report the spatially - resolved sfms relation using ifs data from the califa survey , that holds for kpc scales .",
    "our sample consist of galaxies of mixed morphological types , and masses that extend to three orders of magnitude .",
    "@xmath10 have been derived from stellar population fits to optical spectra and sfrs have been inferred from the extinction - corrected intensity of the h@xmath40 emission line    for an integrated sfr vs. @xmath10 plot we identified two main sequences , one accounts for the rgs and the other for the sfms itself , for this last one we report a slope of 0.81 @xmath8 and a dispersion of 0.20 dex . for the star - forming areas in each galaxy , irrespectively of their integrated properties , we find a correlation between the @xmath43sfr and the @xmath39 that is as tight as the integrated one , and that seems to be the fundamental relation from which the global one is derived .",
    "for the local sfms we found a slope of 0.72 @xmath9 and a dispersion of 0.23 dex .    in future articles we will explore the possible dependance of this relation with other properties of the galaxies , like morphology , color , environment , etc .",
