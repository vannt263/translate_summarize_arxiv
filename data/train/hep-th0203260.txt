    "there are arguments in string theory suggesting that spacetime could be noncommutative @xcite .",
    "although this property might be an argument in favor of new renormalizables effective field theories @xcite , it represents also a trouble because we need to explain the transition between the commutative and noncommutative regimes .",
    "if the noncommutative effects are important at very high energies , then one could posit a decoupling mechanism producing the standard quantum field theory as an effective field theory having no memory about noncommutative effects .",
    "however , our experience in atomic and molecular physics @xcite strongly suggests that the decoupling is never complete , and the high energy effects appear in the effective action as topological remnants @xcite .",
    "following this idea we would like to consider an example , related to topological aspects , where the appearance of noncommutative effects could be relevant .",
    "a natural candidate is the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite where , as we know , the relativistic corrections do not change the qualitative behavior of the fringe pattern @xcite .",
    "as we will see , if the space is noncommutative the total holonomy contains as we will show below a term dependent on the velocity of the electrons , which tends to shift the line spectrum . moreover , a new effect is produced by noncommutativity : particles are scattered even when the magnetic flux is quantized .",
    "our conclusions are reinforced by studying the bound state aharonov - bohm effect @xcite . in this case , although the schrdinger equation can not be exactly solved , one can extract information through perturbation theory since @xmath1 .    as a bonus of the previous results , one find  using perturbation theory an explicit expression for the scattering amplitude and a formula for the differential cross section of the noncommutative aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "there is , however , another interesting conclusion that can be extracted from our research .",
    "the quantum mechanical aharonov - bohm effect is also a relevant mechanism to explain other high energy phenomena . in this sense ,",
    "our calculations allow to extract conclusions for other high energies processes , _",
    "e.g. _ cosmic strings and guts @xcite .",
    "more precisely , using our noncommutative differential cross section , we are able to find a bound for the theta parameter which is in full agreement with other estimations @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the noncommutative aharonov - bohm effect is discussed and a formula for the holonomy is derived ; in section 3 we explain the noncommutative corrections to the bound state aharonov- bohm effect . the general schrdinger equation and the scattering problem in a noncommutative space are considered in section 4 ; in section 5 , we studied the first order noncommutative corrections to the scattering amplitude ; in section 6 , we estimate a bound for the noncommutative parameter and we analyse the experimental possibilities for detecting noncommutative relics and , finally , section 7 contains the conclusions .",
    "two appendixes containing a discussion on the commutative aharonov - bohm effect at high energy and some technical details are included .",
    "in the commutative case , the schrdinger equation with an external gauge potential is solved by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the solution of the free schrdinger equation , and the @xmath4 holonomy , @xmath5 , is in general a non - integrable factor , _",
    "i.e. _ it depends on the integration path @xmath6 .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) solves formally the schrdinger equation , the holonomy involves in a non trivial way the dynamics of the gauge potential , hiding all the complications related to @xmath7 .",
    "our goal below will be to find an approximate expression for the holonomy , valid for small values of the fundamental noncommutative parameter @xmath8 .    in the following we assume that wavefunctions in the plane belong to a noncommutative algebra characterized by the moyal product , defined as @xmath9    the schrdinger equation in this noncommutative space is @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath13 we are assuming , of course , that the magnetic field is zero everywhere except in the origin .",
    "in order to solve ( [ 10 ] ) we use the ansatz @xmath14 as we are assuming that noncommutative effects are small , we expand the moyal product retaining only linear terms in @xmath8 , @xmath15 \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then ( [ 10 ] ) becomes @xmath16 now , one can solve ( [ 13 ] ) perturbatively expanding @xmath17 and @xmath18 in powers of @xmath8 , _",

    "thus , at zero order we reproduce the solution of the commutative case schrdinger equation .",
    "if we retain first order terms in @xmath8 , the following differential equation is obtained , @xmath24 which by integration gives @xmath25    the first term in the rhs of ( [ 18 ] ) is an additive correction to the commutative holonomy which , together with the second term in the rhs of ( [ 16 ] ) gives @xmath26 the second in the rhs of ( [ 18 ] ) is a velocity dependent term , which can be written as @xmath27 for the last term our calculation yields @xmath28    thus , at this order in @xmath8 , the nonconmutative holonomy is given by @xmath29\\biggr]\\right\\}. \\label{21}\\ ] ]    now , we analyze the different terms in ( [ 21 ] ) : the first one in the exponential is the usual holonomy , corrected to order @xmath8 , which classifies the different homotopy classes .",
    "the term in ( [ tercero ] ) is a noncommutative correction to the vortex decaying as @xmath30 , which does not contribute to the line spectrum . finally , the term in ( [ segundo ] ) is a velocity dependent correction insensitive to the topology of the manifold .    in the commutative aharonov - bohm effect ,",
    "the presence of the flux produces a shift in the interference pattern , which is maximum for @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . in such case , for a given value of @xmath33",
    ", the position of maxima and minima are interchanged due to a change of @xmath34 in the phase .",
    "however , in the noncommutative case , this change of positions of maxima and minima might not occur : indeed , the velocity dependent correction modifies the phase shift which , for suitable values of velocity , could even become @xmath35 for a given @xmath33 .",
    "we finalize this section emphasizing two importants aspects of our results :    * the above results are a general property of the noncommutative aharonov - bohm effect , depending only on the total flux @xmath36 ( if the electrons can not penetrate into the solenoid ) . *",
    "if the magnetic flux @xmath37 is an integer there is no aharonov - bohm effect for the commutative case , as is well known @xcite .",
    "however , in the noncommutative case the term ( [ segundo ] ) is different from zero * even in the case where @xmath38 is an integer*. this a quite non - trivial characteristic of the noncommutative aharonov - bohm effect that could be experimentally measured .      in this section",
    "we will evaluate the gauge potential for a finite radius solenoid orthogonal to a noncommutative plane .",
    "the field tensor in the noncommutative plane is @xmath39    expanding the moyal product and retaining only the linear term in @xmath8 , we have @xmath40    we must construct a gauge potential such that the magnetic field @xmath41 vanishes everywhere , except inside the solenoid .",
    "we proceed as in the commutative case , starting with the ansatz ( where the ordinary product is understood ) @xmath42 for @xmath43 , the radius of the solenoid .",

    "( [ 6 ] ) requires @xmath52 .",
    "the final expression for the gauge potential becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the magnetic flux enclosed into the solenoid .",
    "we finally give the gauge potential expressed in terms of polar coordinates , @xmath55 which will be useful in solving the schrdinger equation in the next sections .",
    "in this section we will solve the noncommutative schrdinger equation ( [ 11 ] ) for an electron moving in a two - dimensional manifold parametrized by polar coordinates @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    before doing this",
    ", it is necessary to explain an important technical point : the moyal product ( [ moyal ] ) is implicitly written in cartesian coordinates .",
    "therefore , in order to solve ( [ 11 ] ) in polar coordinates , one must express the @xmath59 product in the general case .",
    "we find the following expression for the the moyal product up to first order in @xmath8 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the determinant of the metric .    at this order in @xmath8 ,",

    "our estimations suggest , however , that the incident electron beam energy should be much larger than the energy reached in these experiments @xcite .",

    "thus , from ( [ wf ] ) one see that the relativistic character of the system is contained in @xmath234 and only the exponential factor , which does not depend on the energy , is responsible for the fringe pattern .",
    "this result reflects the topological nature of the commutative aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "however , our formula ( [ segundo ] ) shows us that the noncommutative ahararonov - bohm effect is radically different because the fringe pattern must change when the electrons are getting higher energies .",
