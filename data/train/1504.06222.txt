    "we assume that the @xmath4 is unbroken .",
    "hence , the hp is massless .",
    "it would be unobservable because the mixing can be removed through a field redefinition .",
    "the kinetic mixing becomes unphysical .",
    "+ the hp field has observable consequences in a minimal extension of this model with a ( fermionic ) field @xmath9 , the hidden fermion .",
    "this fermion is only charged under the @xmath4 with a coupling strength @xmath10 .",
    "this makes @xmath6 a physical parameter because transforming the kinetic mixing away induces an effective coupling of the hidden fermion to the sm photon with a coupling strength @xmath11 .",
    "since the hidden fermion couples to the sm photon , it carries an effective electric charge .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron charge and @xmath14 is the minicharge .",

    "both of them will then contribute to the energy density of radiation during the formation of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "the impact of light degrees of freedom on the cmb is parametrized with the effective neutrino degrees of freedom @xmath3 .",
    "they are defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy density of dark radiation ( dr ) , i.e. all relativistic particles that are not strongly coupled to the sm photon at the cmb epoch , @xmath26 is the energy density of one neutrino species which instantly decoupled from the electron - photon plasma before bbn .",
    "all densities are evaluated at times corresponding to the formation of the cmb anisotropies . @xmath3",
    "scales like @xmath27 .",
    "it is , hence , very sensitive to temperature changes .",
    "+ in the sm the three neutrinos contribute @xmath28  @xcite after correcting for non - instantaneous decoupling .",
    "the most precise observations to date come from the planck collaboration .",
    "they set an upper limit of @xmath29 at 95 % cl on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the cmb epoch .",
    "this value is obtained by fitting a cosmological model to the data .",
    "the limit is conservative since it does not use the controversial value for the hubble rate today , @xmath30 , obtained from local astrophysical measurements .",
    "local measurements prefer a higher value for @xmath3 . also the disputed result obtained by bicep2  @xcite suggests a higher value , @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "+ in order to compare the predictions of models with minicharged particles to the observations , we have to accurately compute the energy density of dark radiation at the cmb epoch .",
    "we numerically solve a set of boltzmann - like equations that parametrize the energy transport between sm particles and the dark sector ( ds ) consisting of hps and mcps @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy density ( pressure ) of the ds and the sm particles , @xmath34 is the hubble parameter , the dot is a derivative with respect to physical time and @xmath35 is a generalized collision term that gives the energy transported from one sector to the other .",
    "+ for the computation we assume that the ds is always in thermal equilibrium with itself .",
    "it is fully characterized by a common temperature @xmath36 and @xmath15 . following the spirit of a dark , weakly coupled sector we initially set @xmath37 .",
    "the ds is then produced by the sm particles during the evolution of the universe . in order to compute this thermalization as accurately as possible",
    "we include all sm particles and light mesons and all relevant processes in our computations .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath38 ds particles are most efficiently produced by sm particle pair annihilation ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "when @xmath36 approaches the sm temperature coulomb - like scattering ( @xmath40 ) , regularized by plasma screening , and ( for large @xmath10 ) compton - like scattering ( @xmath41 ) become the most important processes .",
    "+ we scan over a wide range of parameters @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the constraints for @xmath17 are the most conservative .",
    "for @xmath44 the results are indistinguishable from the results with @xmath17 because in this case the dominant processes are @xmath45 .",
    "a change in @xmath10 can be compensated by a corresponding change in @xmath6 but leaves @xmath14 unchanged .",
    "the bounds for @xmath46 are stronger because compton - like scattering ( @xmath41 ) , which is @xmath47 , becomes dominant for high @xmath10 .",
    "increasing @xmath10 can not be compensated by a shift in @xmath6 anymore if @xmath14 is fixed . for @xmath46",
    "the ds and sm particles equilibrate faster .",
    "+ our result for @xmath48 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] ( left ) .",
    "the sudden increase for small kinetic mixing @xmath49 corresponds to partial thermalization of the ds with the sm photon .",
    "the behavior for large @xmath14 can be understood analytically .",
    "the ds fully thermalizes and after decoupling its temperature at the cmb epoch is given by entropy conservation . for more details",
    "see  @xcite . +",
    "another primordial probe is bbn",
    ". the ds changes the formation of nuclei .",
    "the most sensitive probe is the yield of primordial helium @xmath16 . by adjusting the bbn code of  @xcite",
    ", we computed @xmath16 using the data of our cmb simulation . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : cmb ] ( right ) .",
    "we use @xmath23 at 95% cl  @xcite as a conservative upper bound .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmb ] shows that , using planck s limit , the cmb anisotropies allow for light minicharged particles in the range @xmath50 mev for a wide range of minicharges @xmath14 .",
    "this parameter space is , however , disfavored by the abundance of primordial helium . using these two results we set a lower limit on the hidden fermion mass of @xmath51 mev for @xmath52 . a compilation of this result with earlier approaches using astrophysics , cosmology or laboratory experiments is shown in fig .  [ fig : completeresult ] .",
    "+ if bicep2 has observed primordial gravitational waves , the limit on mcps from the cmb anisotropies vanishes and bbn gives the most stringent bounds .",
