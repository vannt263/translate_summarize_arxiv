    "strong evidence from cosmological observations @xcite indicates that our universe is expanding with an accelerated rate at the present .",
    "this acceleration can be attributed to the dark energy .",
    "the dark energy may be a dynamical scalar field , such as the quintessence @xcite with an extremely flat potential .",
    "the quintessence can be realized by a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) arising from spontaneous breaking of certain global symmetry near the planck scale @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , various neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite have confirmed that the neutrinos have tiny but nonzero masses , of the order @xmath0 .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses can be naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism @xcite . in the original seesaw scenario ,",
    "the neutrinos are of majorana nature which , however , has not been experimentally verified so far .",
    "in fact , the ultralight dirac neutrinos were discussed many years ago @xcite .",
    "recently some interesting models were proposed @xcite , in which the neutrinos can naturally acquire small dirac masses , meanwhile , the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe can be produced by a new type of leptogenesis @xcite , called neutrinogenesis @xcite .",
    "it is striking that the scale of dark energy ( @xmath1 ) is far lower than all the known scales in particle physics except that of the neutrino masses .",
    "the intriguing coincidence between the neutrinos mass scale and the dark energy scale inspires us to consider them in a unified scenario , as in the neutrino dark energy model @xcite .",
    "recently a number of works studied the possible connection between the pngb dark energy and the majorana neutrinos @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a novel model to unify the mass - generation of dirac neutrinos and the origin of dark energy .",
    "in particular , a pngb associated with the neutrino mass - generation provides the candidate for dark energy while the neutrino masses depending on the dark energy field are generated through the dirac seesaw @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our model also resolves the puzzle of cosmological baryon asymmetry via the neutrinogenesis @xcite .",
    "we extend the standard model ( sm ) gauge symmetry @xmath2 with an approximate global symmetry @xmath3 as well as a discrete symmetry @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum number assignment is shown in table[charge ] , where @xmath5 denote the family indices , @xmath6 is the @xmath7 charge , @xmath8 is the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath9 is the right - handed neutrino , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the higgs doublets , @xmath12 is the higgs singlet , @xmath13 is a real scalar .",
    "since all @xmath14 s carry zero @xmath7 charge , we only need to introduce one such doublet - field by defining @xmath15 . as for the other sm fields , which carry even parity under the @xmath4 , they are all singlets under the @xmath7 except that the right - handed charged leptons @xmath16 have the same @xmath7 charge as @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath10 plays a role of the sm higgs .",
    "c|cccc + fields &  @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20   +   + @xmath8 &  * 2 * & @xmath21 & @xmath22&@xmath23 + @xmath9 &  * 1 * & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + @xmath10 &  * 2 * & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + @xmath11 &  * 2 * & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 +  @xmath33 &  * 1 * & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath23 + @xmath13 &  * 1 * & @xmath24 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 +   +    the phase transformations of the three higgs singlets , @xmath38 , are supposed to be independent and hence will result in a global @xmath39 symmetry .",
    "subsequently , the transformations of the higgs doublets @xmath40 under this @xmath39 are determined by requiring the invariance of the following scalar interactions , @xmath41 however , the six higgs doublets @xmath42 only have two independent phase transformations to keep the following yukawa interactions invariant , @xmath43 which explicitly break the @xmath44 down to a @xmath45 .",
    "so , in the presence of eqs.([yukawa1 ] ) and ( [ yukawa2 ] ) , we will have two massless nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngbs ) and one pngb after this global symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values ( _ _ vev__s ) of three higgs singlets @xmath46 .",
    "we then write down the relevant lagrangian , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the mass - dimension one while @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are dimensionless . for convenience , we will denote @xmath53 and @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "after the three higgs singlets @xmath46 acquire their _ _",
    "vev__s , @xmath56 , we can write @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the three neutral higgs and the three ngbs , respectively . here",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 since @xmath62 . in this approach , due to the explicit breaking of @xmath63",
    ", one of these three ngbs will acquire a finite mass via the coleman - weinberg potential and thus become a pngb , while the other two remain massless , as a result of spontaneous breaking of the subgroup @xmath64 .    for convenience",
    "we redefine the higgs doublets @xmath65 as @xmath66 and then express the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian1 ] ) in a new form , @xmath67+\\textrm{h.c.}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the definitions , @xmath68 at this stage , the last yukawa term in ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) depends on all three fields @xmath69 .",
    "however , by making the further phase rotations on the left - handed lepton doublets and the right - handed neutrinos , we can find that except one combination of @xmath70 still remains in the yukawa interaction , the other two disappear from ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) , so they only have derivative interactions and stay as the massless ngbs .",
    "for instance , we can make the following rotations , @xmath71 and then obtain @xmath72 where @xmath73 with the definition @xmath74 here @xmath75 should be of the order of the @xmath64 breaking scales , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "it is impossible to remove @xmath77 from the yukawa interactions by further transformation .",
    "we will show later that this @xmath77 is a pngb with a tiny mass and can naturally serve as the candidate of dark energy .",
    "we consider the case that after the @xmath78 breaking , the mass - square ( [ massdoublet1 ] ) of @xmath79 and the eigenvalues of the mass - square matrix ( [ massdoublet2 ] ) for @xmath80 are all positive .",
    "so , these higgs doublets can develop nonzero _ _ vev__s only after the sm higgs - doublet @xmath10 and the real scalar @xmath13 both acquire their _ _",
    "vev__s @xcite , @xmath81 \\langle h \\rangle \\langle \\chi \\rangle m^{-2}_{0 } \\mu^{}_{0}\\ , , & ~~\\textrm{for}~ i = j\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in consequence , the neutrinos obtain small dirac masses , @xmath82    the discrete @xmath4 symmetry is expected to break at the tev scale by the _ vev _ of the real scalar @xmath13 symmetry by a global or local @xmath83 symmetry @xcite , under which all sm particles transform as singlets , while @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 carry the @xmath84 charge @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "this @xmath83 symmetry is spontaneously broken at tev by the _ vev _ of @xmath13 .",
    "so @xmath87 is fixed by the @xmath83 symmetry breaking scale around @xmath88 . in the case of a local @xmath83 symmetry ,",
    "we need add three massless left - handed singlet fermions , @xmath89 with the @xmath84 charge @xmath86 , which decouple from everything and make the theory anomaly free . in this case , the new gauge boson couples to @xmath90 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 rather than the sm particles , so it is expected to escape the detection at the lhc and ilc . ] , so we will set @xmath87 around @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , it is reasonable to take @xmath92 less than @xmath93 in ( [ doubletvev ] ) . under this setup , it is straightforward to see that the dirac neutrino masses will be efficiently suppressed by the ratio of the electroweak scale over the heavy masses .",
    "for instance , we find that , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the neutrino masses can be naturally around @xmath98 .",
    "we see that this mechanism of the neutrino mass generation has two essential features : ( i ) it generates dirac masses for neutrinos , and ( ii ) it retains the essence of the conventional seesaw @xcite by making the neutrino masses tiny via the small ratio of the electroweak scale over the heavy mass scale .",
    "this is a realization of dirac seesaw @xcite .",
    "so far cosmological observations @xcite strongly support the existence of dark energy which accelerates the expansion of our universe .",
    "one plausible explanation for the dark energy has its origin in a dynamical scalar field , such as the quintessence @xcite with an extremely flat potential .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the pngb provides an attractive realization of the quintessence field .",
    "we have pointed out that after the higgs singlets getting their _ _",
    "vev__s , one ngb @xmath77 [ as shown in ( [ yukawa3])-([combination ] ) ] will remain in the neutrino yukawa interactions ( which explicitly breaks the global @xmath99 ) .",
    "therefore , this ngb will develop a finite mass from the coleman - weinberg effective potential via these neutrino yukawa interactions , and thus become a pngb .",
    "we can explicitly compute the coleman - weinberg potential for @xmath77 at one - loop order , @xmath100 where @xmath101 ( as a function of @xmath77 ) is the _",
    "_ k__th eigenvalue of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "note that there is an irrelevant quadratical term in @xmath104 , @xmath105 , which has no @xmath77-dependence and is thus omitted in ( [ v - q ] ) .",
    "a typical term in @xmath104 contributing to the potential of a pngb field @xmath106 has the form , @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "it is well - known that with @xmath75 of the order of planck scale @xmath109 , @xmath106 obtains a mass of @xmath110 and is a consistent candidate for the quintessence dark energy .",
    "we now demonstrate how to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in our model . we make use of the neutrinogenesis mechanism @xcite .",
    "since the sphalerons @xcite have no direct effect on the right - handed fields , a nonzero lepton asymmetry stored in the right - handed fields could survive above the electroweak phase transition and then produce the baryon asymmetry in the universe , although the lepton asymmetry stored in the left - handed fields had been destroyed by the sphalerons .",
    "for all the sm species , the yukawa couplings are sufficiently strong to rapidly cancel the stored left- and right - handed lepton asymmetry . but the effective yukawa interactions of the dirac neutrinos are exceedingly weak , and the equilibrium between the left - handed lepton doublets and the right - handed neutrinos will not be realized until temperatures fall well below the electroweak scale . at that time",
    "the lepton asymmetry stored in the left - handed lepton doublets has already been converted to the baryon asymmetry by the sphalerons .",
    "in particular , the final baryon asymmetry should be @xmath111 for the sm with three generation fermions and one higgs doublet .",
    "there are two types of final states coexisting in the decays of every heavy higgs doublet , @xmath112 \\chi\\,h\\ , .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the channels of @xmath113 and @xmath114 can provide the expected asymmetry between the right - handed neutrinos and anti - neutrinos if the cp is not conserved and the decays are out of thermal equilibrium . as shown in fig.[decay ] , the mixing ( [ massdoublet2 ] ) among @xmath42 help to generate the interference between the tree - level decay and the irreducible loop - correction . for convenience ,",
    "we adopt the following definitions , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the orthogonal rotation matrix to diagonalize @xmath42 in their mass - eigenbasis @xmath117 .",
    "we then derive the relevant cp - asymmetry , @xmath118}{\\gamma_{a}^{}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sum_{b\\neq a}^{}\\frac{\\textrm{im}\\left [ ( \\widehat{y}^{\\dagger}_{}\\widehat{y})_{ba}^{}\\widehat{\\mu}_{b}^{\\ast}\\widehat{\\mu}_{a}^{}\\right ] } { ( \\widehat{y}^{\\dagger}_{}\\widehat{y})_{aa}^{}\\widehat{m}_{a}^{2}+\\left|\\widehat{\\mu}_{a}^{}\\right|^{2}_{}}\\frac{\\widehat{m}_{a}^{2 } } { \\widehat{m}_{a}^{2}-\\widehat{m}_{b}^{2}}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath119 \\widehat{m}_{a}^{}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being the total decay width of @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "for illustration , we will use @xmath120 to denote the lightest one among all heavy higgs doublets ( including @xmath79 ) , and hence the contribution of @xmath120 is expected to dominate the final baryon asymmetry , which is given by the approximate relation @xcite , @xmath122 \\displaystyle \\frac{0.3\\,\\varepsilon_{a}^{}}{g_{\\ast}^{}k\\left(\\ln k\\right)^{0.6}_{}}\\ , , & ~\\textrm{for}&k \\gg 1 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the parameter @xmath123 is defined as @xmath124 which characterizes the deviation from equilibrium . for instance , inputting @xmath125 , and the maximum cp - phase , we derive the sample predictions : @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where we have used @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in consequence ,",
    "we deduce , @xmath130 , as desired .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a new model to realize dirac neutrinos , dark energy and baryon asymmetry . in particular , the heavy higgs doublets develop small _ _ vev__s which make the neutrinos acquire small masses through the dirac seesaw . furthermore , the pngb associated with the dirac neutrino mass - generation can be the quintessence field and thus provide an attractive candidate for dark energy .",
    "finally , our model generates the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe via the out - of - equilibrium decays of the heavy higgs doublets with cp - violation .    in our model , the dirac neutrino masses are functions of the dark energy field .",
    "the dark energy is a dynamical component and will evolute with time and/or in space . in consequence ,",
    "the dirac neutrino masses are variable , rather than constant .",
    "the prediction of the neutrino - mass variation could be verified in the experiments , such as the observation on the cosmic microwave background and the large scale structures @xcite , the measurement of the extremely high - energy cosmic neutrinos @xcite and the analysis of the neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the real scalar @xmath13 has a _ vev _ around the electroweak scale , it can mix with and couple to the sm higgs boson via the quartic interaction , @xmath131\\chi^{2}_{}h^{\\dagger}_{}h , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath132 being a dimensionless parameter .",
    "hence , the sm higgs boson is no longer a mass - eigenstate , and its collider signatures will be modified @xcite .",
    "further phenomenological analyses for such non - standard higgs boson will be given elsewhere .",
