    "recently , the development of numerical schemes for strong as well as weak approximation of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) has focused amongst others on runge  kutta type schemes  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the increasing complexity of stochastic taylor expansions and the desire to avoid derivatives in higher order approximation schemes . in section  [ sec",
    ": srk - methods ] , a class of stochastic runge  kutta ( srk ) methods due to rler  @xcite for the weak approximation of it sde systems with a multi  dimensional wiener process is considered .",
    "this class contains as a special case the second order srk scheme proposed by platen  @xcite as well as the class of srk methods proposed by tocino and vigo - aguiar  @xcite .",
    "order conditions for coefficients of the srk methods have been calculated by applying the multi - colored rooted tree analysis due to rler  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier work on this topic , the aim of the present paper is to analyze these order conditions with the objective to determine a full classification of the coefficients for this class of srk methods .",
    "a full classification for order one srk schemes with @xmath0 stage and for order one srk schemes with deterministic order two for @xmath1 stages as well as for second order srk schemes with @xmath2 stages is calculated in section  [ sec : parameter - families ] .",
    "further , some optimal schemes are derived from this classification in section  [ sec : optimal - schemes ] by taking into account additional higher order conditions .",
    "their performance is studied by some numerical examples in section  [ sec : numerical - example ] .",
    "+   + we denote by @xmath3 the solution of the @xmath4-dimensional it sde defined by @xmath5 with an @xmath6-dimensional wiener process @xmath7 and @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we assume that the borel - measurable coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfy a lipschitz and a linear growth condition such that the existence and uniqueness theorem  @xcite applies . in the following ,",
    "let @xmath11 denote the @xmath12th column of the diffusion matrix @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "+   + let a discretization @xmath15 with @xmath16 of the time interval @xmath8 $ ] with step sizes @xmath17 for @xmath18 be given .",
    "further , define @xmath19 as the maximum step size .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the space of all @xmath21 fulfilling a polynomial growth condition and let @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .    a time discrete approximation @xmath27 converges weakly with order @xmath28 to @xmath29 as @xmath30 at time @xmath31 if for each @xmath32 exist a constant @xmath33 and a finite @xmath34 such that @xmath35 holds for each @xmath360,\\delta_0[\\,$ ] .",
    "we consider stochastic runge  kutta methods as proposed in @xcite for the weak approximation of sde  ( [ st - lg - sde - ito-1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4-dimensional approximation process @xmath37 of an explicit @xmath38-stage srk method is defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath18 with stage values @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 for @xmath47 with @xmath48 for @xmath49 are the vectors and matrices of coefficients of the srk method .",
    "we choose @xmath50 for @xmath51 with a vector @xmath52 @xcite . in the following , the product of column vectors is defined component - wise .",
    "the coefficients of the srk method  ( [ srk - method - ito - wm - allg01 ] ) are determined by the following butcher tableau :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ) and sde  ( [ simu : dm - sde]).,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ] ) and sde  ( [ simu : dm - sde]).,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]    ) and sde  ( [ simu : dm - sde]).,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ] ) and sde  ( [ simu : dm - sde]).,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]     +   + due to the results in figure  [ bild001 ] , we can see that for both test equations the so called optimal srk scheme rdi1wm attains much better orders of convergence than the well known order one em scheme .",
    "the same holds for the optimal srk schemes rdi3wm and rdi4wm compared to the order two schemes exem and pl1wm .",
    "clearly , the optimal srk schemes rdi1wm , rdi3wm and rdi4wm need some additional computational effort compared to the schemes em , exem and pl1wm , respectively .",
    "therefore , we take the number of evaluations of the drift function @xmath53 and of each diffusion function @xmath54 , @xmath55 , as well as the number of random variables that have to be simulated as a measure for the computational effort . then we can compare the computational effort versus the errors of the analyzed schemes .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ bild002 ] , and again , rdi1wm performs much better than the scheme em for both test equations .",
    "further , rdi3wm yields similar results like rdi4wm which is for higher precisions slightly better than pl1wm and significantly better than the scheme exem for the test equation  ( [ simu : nonlinear - sde2 ] ) . considering the multi - dimensional test equation ( [ simu : dm - sde ] ) ,",
    "the scheme rdi3wm is again close to rdi4wm which performs for higher precisions slightly better than exem .",
    "however both optimal srk schemes rdi3wm and rdi4wm are significantly better than the srk scheme pl1wm .",
    "in the present work , a full classification of the coefficients for a class of explicit srk methods of order @xmath56 for @xmath0 and order @xmath57 for @xmath1 stages as well as for the orders @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath2 stages is calculated .",
    "based on this classification , coefficients for so called optimal srk schemes are determined by considering additional higher order conditions .",
    "optimal coefficients for srk methods of order @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are calculated and similarly to the deterministic setting  @xcite , better convergence results are expected for these schemes in general . finally , the srk schemes based on optimal coefficients are applied to some test equations . here , it turned out that the proposed optimal srk schemes attain higher orders of convergence than the well known schemes under consideration and they also perform very well if the computational effort is taken into account .",
    "+   + for future research , it would be interesting to extend the presented classification to diagonal or fully implicit srk methods .",
    "further , the given classification may be applied in order to determine coefficients for srk methods with optimal stability properties .",
