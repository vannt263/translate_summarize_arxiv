    "corrections to the @xmath0 decay are usually described in the framework of an effective theory , ) we discarded terms proportional to @xmath1 since they give only small contributions to the branching ratio that start at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) .",

    "@xmath2 here , @xmath3 are renormalization scale dependent effective couplings , the so - called wilson coefficients , which encode the heavy gauge boson and the heavy top quark effects .",

    "doing so , one finds that the leading term is the partonic decay rate which gives the dominant contribution , while the non - leading terms , the so - called power - corrections , are suppressed by powers of @xmath16 and give non - vanishing contributions starting from @xmath17 . ) and its ope hold only for @xmath18 . in all other cases",
    "the @xmath12 contain contributions in which the photon couples to light quarks ( @xmath19 ) , and this leads to non - perturbative effects different from that mentioned above ( see section [ sec::non - perturbative ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath20 , contributions that contain no photon in the final state should be excluded , as required by the experimental setup . ] in what follows we describe the state - of - the - art of perturbative and non - perturbative corrections in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the calculation of the perturbative corrections can be divided into three steps . in the first step one",
    "has to evaluate the effective couplings @xmath3 at the high - energy scale @xmath21 by requiring equality of the standard model and the effective theory green functions . defining @xmath22 ,",
    "the effective couplings can be expanded as follows , @xmath23 at nnlo accuracy one has to determine the coefficients @xmath24 . for @xmath25=@xmath26 it required performing a three - loop calculation @xcite whereas for the remaining cases @xmath25=@xmath27",
    "a two - loop calculation was sufficient @xcite .",
    "the second step involves the calculation of the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath28 which describes the mixing of the operators under renormalization .",
    "its knowledge is necessary to solve the effective theory renormalization group equations for the effective couplings , @xmath29 and to evolve the latter down to the low - energy scale @xmath30 . performing a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling constant",
    ", the anomalous dimension matrix takes the following form , @xmath31 at nnlo one has to determine @xmath32 which is actually a @xmath33 matrix , @xmath34      0_{2\\times 6 } & c_{2\\times2}^{(2 ) }    \\end{pmatrix}\\,.\\ ] ] the block matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 describing the self - mixing of the four - quark operators and the self - mixing of the dipole operators at three loops , respectively , have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the block matrix @xmath14 describing the mixing of the four - quark operators into the dipole operators at four loops has been determined in @xcite . after this calculation",
    "the first two steps of the perturbative calculation were completed , that is the effective couplings at the low - energy scale @xmath30 with resummed logarithms are now known at nnlo accuracy .. ]    in the last step one has to calculate on - shell amplitudes of the operators at the low - energy scale .",
    "this is the most difficult part of the nnlo enterprise and it is still under investigation . in order to see what has been done so far , and what still has to be done , we write the decay rate for the partonic decay @xmath37 as follows , @xmath38 where @xmath39 can again be expanded in terms of @xmath40 , @xmath41 at nnlo one has to determine the coefficients of @xmath42 which , however , has only been done in a complete manner for @xmath25=@xmath43=@xmath44 @xcite .",
    "once we neglect on - shell amplitudes that are proportional to the small wilson coefficients of the four - quark penguin operators @xmath45-@xmath46 , the remaining cases to be considered are @xmath47=@xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the large-@xmath50 corrections are known in all these cases except for @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "in addition , effects of the charm and bottom quark masses on the gluon lines are known in all the cases @xcite .",
    "the other beyond - large-@xmath50 corrections have been found only in the limit @xmath53 , except for the @xmath54 and @xmath49 cases @xcite .",
    "this limit has been used to interpolate the unknown beyond - large-@xmath50 corrections at @xmath55 to the measured value of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the result for the branching ratio , for @xmath57 , is given by @xcite @xmath58 the theoretical uncertainty of this nnlo estimate is at the same level as the uncertainty of the current world average reported by hfag @xcite , @xmath59 which is furthermore expected to come down to the 5% level at the end of the b - factory era .    here",
    "a remark concerning the overall normalization of the theoretical prediction is in order . to reduce parametric uncertainties stemming from the ckm angles as well as from the @xmath60- and @xmath4-quark masses , the partonic decay rate given in ( [ eq::gamma - partonic ] )",
    "is usually normalized using a combination of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 decay rates which is reflected by the appearance of the semileptonic phase - space factor @xmath63 in the analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "is already known at nnlo accuracy @xcite . ] unfortunately , the determination of @xmath64 and @xmath36 from the fit from the measured spectrum of the @xmath61 decay in the 1s scheme @xcite differs from that in the kinetic scheme @xcite . and",
    "@xmath36 from @xcite were adopted . ] using the values for @xmath64 and @xmath36 of the latter determination results in a higher central value for the @xmath0 decay rate @xcite , @xmath65 the difference of @xmath64 and @xmath36 in the 1s and kinetic scheme is likely to be due to different input data , differences in the fit method , and treatment of theory errors . in this respect , supplementing the fit , for example , by the determination of the @xmath60- and @xmath4-quark masses from sumrules @xcite could possibly be helpful to reduce the discrepancy of @xmath36 in both schemes .",
    "we should also remark that not all of the aforementioned contributions to the function @xmath66 entered the analysis of @xcite .",
    "these are the massive fermionic corrections presented in @xcite and the large-@xmath50 contributions for @xmath47@xmath67@xmath68 from @xcite . into the chromomagnetic dipole operator @xmath69 @xcite",
    "was not included in @xcite . ]",
    "these contributions will be included in a future update together with so far unknown contributions , which is , for example , the complete knowledge of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "also the complete calculation of @xmath71 for @xmath72 is underway @xcite .",
    "especially the latter will prove useful in the reduction of the uncertainty stemming from the interpolation in @xmath64 .",
    "apart from the nnlo corrections also tree - level diagrams with the @xmath73-quark analogues of @xmath74 and the four - quark operators @xmath75 have been neglected so far @xcite .",
    "the numerical effect of all of these contributions on the branching ratio is or is expected to remain within the uncertainty of the nnlo estimate given in ( [ eq::nnlo - estimate ] ) .",
    "finally , we should mention that there are also cutoff - enhanced corrections which matter close to the endpoint @xcite .",
    "however , as demonstrated in @xcite , the resummation of the cutoff - enhanced logarithms overestimates the effect of the @xmath76-terms for @xmath77",
    ". therefore , the prediction for the branching ratio given in ( [ eq::nnlo - estimate ] ) should , at present , be considered as more reliable .",
    "since the perturbative calculations in @xmath0 are now performed at nnlo the non - perturbative corrections become more important . in general well under control are the power - corrections stemming from the ope of the time ordered products contained in ( [ eq::wij ] ) . for the self - interference of the electromagnetic operator , that is for @xmath25=@xmath43=@xmath44 , they are known at @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath78 @xcite . for all other combinations of @xmath79 and @xmath80 the time ordered products include contributions in which the photon couples to light quarks , and that causes the breakdown of the ope . in this case",
    "non - perturbative collinear effects @xcite as well as power - corrections at @xmath81 show up @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of all of the aforementioned non - perturbative corrections is of around 3% in the branching ratio . besides",
    ", non - perturbative effects appearing at @xmath82 show up when the photon couples to light quarks .",
    "their size is not known at present and hence a 5% uncertainty related to all the unknown non - perturbative effects has been included in ( [ eq::nnlo - estimate ] ) .",
    "the size of this uncertainty is supported by the estimate of the @xmath82-corrections in the interference of the electro- and chromomagnetic dipole operators performed in @xcite . as pointed out in references @xcite , the magnitude of the effect considered in @xcite",
    "could be probed by an improved measurement @xcite of the isospin asymmetry @xmath83 finally , we note that a non - perturbative uncertainty appears also when extrapolating the three different measurements performed at cleo , babar and belle down to the common lower cut @xmath57 in the photon energy .",
    "it is accounted for in the error of the world average given in ( [ eq::hfag ] ) .",
    "at present the uncertainties in the branching ratio of @xmath0 are on the same level on both the theoretical and experimental side .",
    "thanks to the ongoing calculations of the perturbative corrections the uncertainty stemming from this part will further reduce . however , to reach the 5% level or even less on the theoretical side a better understanding of the non - perturbative power - corrections at @xmath82 is required .      _",
