    "a number of past observations and theoretical researches have revealed a rough scenario for the formation of isolated , single low - mass stars . that is , a gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core is the starting point of star formation , then a protostar with a thick envelope and bipolar outflows @xcite is born .",
    "the outflows blow off the protostellar envelope , which could have an impact on the mass assembling process of the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , affect the motion of the cloud around the protostar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and cause outflow - triggered star formation @xcite , as well as generates turbulence and limit the efficiency of star formation @xcite .    it is still veiled how to form stars in a group or a cluster @xcite , although most stars are known to be born that way .",
    "if stars are forming in a group or cluster , impacts of outflows on the environment may be greater than in the formation of isolated stars .",
    "therefore , it is important to study interactions between outflows and dense gas in cluster - forming regions for comprehensive understandings of star formation processes .",
    "the cederblad ( ced ) 110 region @xcite is located in the center of the chamaeleon ( cha ) i dark cloud , one of the low - mass star formation regions in the solar vicinity ( @xmath6=160pc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite identified a c@xmath7o clump in the ced 110 region , whose radius is 0.19 pc and mass is 11.7 @xmath8 .",
    "this is the most massive clump in their samples .",

    "[ ced110table ] we list the objects with their position , ir class , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 .    the youngest object in this region , cha - mms1 , was detected by 1.3 mm continuum observations by @xcite . at this position",

    "thus , mms1 is considered to be a `` real protostar '' @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite could not detect 3 or 6 cm radio continuum emission .",
    "this result indicates mms1 does not have any jets or outflows .",
    "they noted that mms1 is still at a prestellar stage .",

    "* ) , but the identification of its driving source has been controversial .",
    "originally , irs4 was thought to be driving this outflow .",
    "however , @xcite detected mms1 and suggested that mms1 is the driving source of the outflow as well as the nearby herbig - haro ( hh ) objects hh49/50 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . while @xcite revealed that mms1 is associated with no jets",
    ", @xcite suggested that a parsec - scale outflow is ejected from mms1 based on the positional relationship among the hh objects and the ysos in their large area shock survey .",
    "lack of high - resolution mapping observations of the outflow ( e.g. the mapping grid was 1@xmath12 in mattila et al .",
    "1989 ) have made it difficult to resolve this issue .",
    "ced110 irs11 was first detected by @xcite as irs 4e in their near - ir image .",
    "@xcite tentatively detected a far - ir source from _ iso _ data , and identified irs11 as iso - chai 86 @xcite .",
    "the coordinates for irs11 in table [ ced110table ] are based on the position for chai 86 in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the following three points ; ( 1 ) the distribution of dense gas in the yso clustering region , ( 2 ) the influence of outflows from older protostars on newer ones and the surrounding gas , and ( 3 ) the `` blue asymmetry '' line profile toward ysos which indicates the existence of infalling gas @xcite . to investigate them we observed co(@xmath1=3 - 2 ) and hco@xmath0(@xmath1=4 - 3 ) lines .",
    "the observations of the co line can reveal the distribution of molecular outflows with high spatial resolution and enable us to distinguish the driving source of outflows .",
    "the hco@xmath0 line has a high critical density of @xmath1310@xmath14 @xmath15 at the @xmath1=4 - 3 transition @xcite , and its observations can probe dense gas and also can detect gas infall in protostellar systems through detection of the blue asymmetry in line profiles .",
    "we also made observations of the optically thin h@xmath16co@xmath0 line toward ced110 irs4 and cha - mms1 to obtain precise physical parameters .",

    "these high energy levels made these lines useful diagnostic tools of shocked regions .",
    "we introduce the detail of our observations in  2 , and the results of the observations are described in  3 . in  4 we discuss molecular abundance , gas infall toward protostars , kinematics of outflows , and the interaction between mms1 and the outflow from irs4 .",

    "thus the angular resolution of our observations is high enough to resolve this size of a core . with this grid spacing",
    ", we obtained spectra toward 136 points which resulted in 4@xmath24 maps centered at irs4 .",

    "a hco@xmath0 clump of dense gas is seen in fig.[hcomap ] .",

    "almost all co line profiles have a dip at @xmath48 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the dip also appears in some hco@xmath0 line profiles at the same velocity .",
    "the velocity of the dip is identical to that of c@xmath7o clump number 3 identified in the ced110 region by @xcite , and also gives close agreement with the velocities of optically thin lines observed by @xcite .",
    "these correspondences mean that this dip is caused by self - absorption by less excited gas , not the result of two emission components with different velocities along the same line of sight .",
    "since the observed region corresponds to one c@xmath7o clump , the outer gas of the clump in the lower excitation level would make the co absorption .",
    "the dip in the hco@xmath0(@xmath1=4 - 3 ) line indicates a significant population of the @xmath49 level that requires a moderately high density , but with a lower @xmath1=4 - 3 excitation temperature than in the center of the clump . this is a reflection of the density gradient in the clump .",
    "we can find these dips in fig .",
    "[ pv7 ] and [ pv9 ] .",
    "this dip prevents the channel map ( fig.[hcochmap ] ) from representing the actual distribution of interstellar matter in the dip velocity .",
    "the indentations of contours located at the south of irs4 and a lack of a peak around mms1 in the panels of @xmath50 and 4.57 km s@xmath22 of fig.[hcochmap ] may be due to the self - absorption .",
    "it is conceivable that other reasons such as depletion and chemistry in the dense gas cause this lack of a peak .",
    "the issue of molecular depletion is discussed in  4.1 .",
    "the parameters of the lines detected at yso positions are summarized in tables [ cotable ] , [ hcotable ] and [ h13cotable ] .",
    "we fitted the spectral data of hco@xmath0 and h@xmath16co@xmath0 with a gaussian profile .",
    "the error estimates of the values in the tables come from the fit . in deriving the line parameters , the velocity ranges of outflows and self - absorption features in the lines",
    "are eliminated in the fitting processes .",
    "although this may have some defectiveness , this is the optimal handling of our data .",
    "bipolar outflow from irs4 is detected in our co(@xmath1=3 - 2 ) observations .",
    "this outflow had been also detected by @xcite and @xcite with their co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) observations .",
    "we compared the line profiles toward irs4 with that of the ambient gas obtained at the edge of the map in ( @xmath25)(j2000 ) = ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "judging from this comparison shown in fig.[ysolines]_a _ , the line profile in the velocity ranges of @xmath53 km s@xmath22 and @xmath546.3 km s@xmath22 are not affected by the ambient gas , and thus we identified these ranges as outflow components .    the distribution of the outflow components from irs4 are shown in fig.[outflowit ] ( integrated intensity map ) and fig.[outflowcm ] ( channel map ) .",
    "the blueshifted and redshifted outflows show a different aspect .",
    "the spatial extent of the blueshifted outflow is considerably larger than that of the redshifted outflow .",
    "furthermore , the highest velocity component of the blueshifted outflow lies midway between irs4 and mms1 , while the velocity reaches its peak around irs4 in the redshifted flow .",
    "the near - ir images @xcite indicate that irs4 is seen nearly edge - on .",
    "the observed distribution of the blueshifted component of the outflow extending to the south suggests that the outflow axis slightly inclines with the southern side closer than the northern side .",
    "this configuration is in agreement with the previous remarks on the inclination of irs4 based on the color gradient of the nebulae @xcite .",
    "they found that the northern part of the reflection nebula is redder than the southern part , which suggests that the northern part is tilted away from us .",
    "our integrated intensity map ( fig.[outflowit ] ) does not show the redshifted component in the south of mms1 reported in the literature @xcite . in the channel map ( fig.[outflowcm ] ) , however , one can see the extended redshifted emission at @xmath55 km s@xmath22 , and this could be its counterpart .",
    "observations of the h@xmath16co@xmath0(@xmath1=4 - 3 ) line were also performed toward irs4 ( fig.[ysolines]a ) with a 43 mk noise level .",
    "the fwhm of this line , @xmath56 km s@xmath22 , corresponds to that of the hco@xmath0 line within the margin of error .",

    "the dip in the hco@xmath0 line is deeper than that of irs4 .",
    "this deeper dip shows that mms1 is deeply embedded in the densest part of c@xmath7o clump number 3 @xcite , because mms1 lies nearer to the position of the peak intensity of c@xmath7o than irs4 .",
    "we calculated the hco@xmath0 `` original '' integrated intensity with a gaussian fit using the line profiles in the velocity ranges which are free from self - absorption .",
    "these reconstructed `` absorption - free '' contours are shown with dashed linea in fig.[hcomap ] .",
    "the summit ridge of the contours extends south and reaches the position of mms1 .",
    "this result again supports the idea that mms1 is deeply embedded and its outer envelope makes this absorption feature .    around mms1 , there are no conspicuous wide lines ( fig.[pv9 ] ) .",
    "this shows that no outflow is associated with mms1 , which is consistent with the lack of centimeter continuum emission from ionized jets @xcite .",
    "thus , mms1 is rejected as a driving source of the outflows seen in co ( @xmath57 ) maps @xcite as well as a launcher of hh49/50 .",
    "there are some literatures which summarized properties of class 0 objects @xcite .",
    "we performed a literature survey about three aspects of the class 0 objects : centimeter continuum emission , co outflows , and hh objects .",
    "all class 0 sources that appeared in the four papers had at least one aspect out of the three . on the other hand",

    "our results show no evidence of protostar activity in mms1 .",
    "the h@xmath16co@xmath0(@xmath1=4 - 3 ) line was detected toward mms1 .",
    "the width of the line , 0.36 km s@xmath22 , is smaller than that of the same line toward irs4 .",
    "this optically thin line could reflect the cold innermost region of mms1 ; thus , the narrow line shows there are no protostars formed yet in mms1 .",
    "the virial mass of mms1 is derived from the h@xmath16co@xmath0 line width .",
    "assuming the diameter of mms1 is @xmath58 pc @xcite , the virial mass is calculated to be 0.49 @xmath8 .",

    "irs6 is a binary source ( irs6a and irs6b ) , and the near - ir luminosity of irs6a is a factor of 7 higher than the companion @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that the features obtained toward the binary system mainly derive from irs6a .    toward irs6",
    ", we found a weak outflow component in the co line ( fig.[outflowit ] , [ pv7 ] , and [ ysolines]_c _ ) which has not been detected in past radio observations .",

    "this result supports previous study by @xcite that irs6 has no massive circumstellar envelope .",

    "because this object is thought of as a `` good candidate young brown dwarf '' with a stellar mass of 0.02 @xmath8 @xcite , the amount of the envelope associated with nir89 should be too small to be detected by our hco@xmath0 observations .",
    "no co outflow components or hco@xmath0 emission were detected toward the class ii / iii objects , iso - cha i 97 , iso - chai101 , and ced110 irs2 ( fig.[ysolines]_f - h _ ) .",

    "this is because the redshifted component is absorbed by the cooler infalling material in the near half of the envelope along the line of sight .",

    "in general , there are some possibilities to confuse not only outflow , but core rotation and other large - scale physical structures with infall , all of which affect obtained line profiles .",
    "thus , it is difficult to investigate infall motion in targeted observations toward protostars without high - resolution spatial information about the envelope .",
    "the other problem is optical depth .",
    "choosing molecular lines with appropriate optical depth is necessary to detect infall motion of the inner portion of the envelope in general , not only for ced110 .",
    "when a protostar is highly embedded in a dense clump and an observed line becomes optically too thick , the line can not convey information of the inner infalling region any more and reflects only properties of foreground components .",
    "we calculated the physical parameters of the outflows from irs4 according to the procedures of @xcite . in these procedures , the co column density for each channel in units of @xmath77 , @xmath84 , and the mass per channel , @xmath85 , are calculated from @xmath86 \\over [ { \\rm c}]}{[{\\rm c } ] \\over [ { \\rm co } ] } ,       \\label{outflow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87[1-\\exp(-16.597/t_{\\rm ex } ) ] ,       \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath88 is the line intensity of the co(@xmath1=3 - 2 ) line , @xmath89 is the channel width in km s@xmath22 , @xmath90 is the fraction of co molecules in the @xmath91 state , @xmath92 = 160 pc is the distance to the cha i cloud , @xmath93 is the solid angle subtended by emission , [ h]/[c]@xmath94 , [ c]/[co ] @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the optical depth of the line .",
    "we calculated @xmath97 comparing with co(@xmath1=3 - 2 ) and co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) line - wing intensity @xcite . in this calculation",
    ", we assumed that the excitation temperatures @xmath98 of the two lines are equal to 20 k. according to large velocity gradiant simulations by @xcite , @xmath99 does not vary so much within the reasonable density and temperature range .",
    "therefore , we set the same value of @xmath100 as in @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath101 , momentum @xmath102 , and kinetic energy @xmath103 can be estimated from @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the system velocity .",
    "we also calculated the dynamical timescale @xmath106 where the characteristic velocity @xmath107 , mass loss rate @xmath108 , and average driving force @xmath109 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ outflowtables ] .",
    "we adopted an inclination of the outflow axis from the line of sight of @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "they derived this value through comparing near - ir images with three - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code of a disk - shadow projection model .",
    "this value is consistent with the fact that the high - resolution infrared images @xcite clearly show the edge - on disklike silhouette of irs4 .",
    "we compared the derived values with those in a statistical study of outflows @xcite in which they show a correlation between the mass , @xmath11 and @xmath111 for 391 samples .",
    "the mass of irs4 s blueshifted outflow is smaller by about 1 order of magnitude than the average of the same @xmath11 sources in @xcite , but it is still within the range of variation of the data .    in contrast , the derived mass loss rate is rather large in irs4 despite its small size . generally , the mass loss rate by jets is about 1% and that by outflows is10 % of the mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the derived value of 1.1 @xmath112 yr@xmath22 is comparable to the typical accretion rate for protostars , 10@xmath113 yr@xmath22 , derived by the similarity solution for thermally supported clouds with 10 k @xcite .",
    "hh49/50 is a group of knots located 10.5@xmath12 southwest of the ced110 region .",
    "studies of radial velocity and proper motion @xcite revealed the knots move toward the southwest and away from us . @xcite and",
    "@xcite identified ced110 irs4 as the driving source of these hh objects judging from their co outflow map , because they found a diffuse redshifted component that extends in the southwest of irs4 and the alignment of knots is almost parallel to the direction to irs4 . in our observations , we detected two components that extend to the south of irs4 .",
    "one is the prominent blueshifted outflow which has an opposite line - of - sight direction of movement from hh objects .",
    "the other is the diffuse redshifted component that appeared in fig.[outflowcm ] .",
    "this complicated morphology makes it difficult to discuss the relation between irs4 and hh49/50 . to resolve this issue",
    ", one should enlarge co observations toward the southwest to know the larger structure of the outflow .    in fig.[pv7 ] and",
    "[ pv9 ] , the hco@xmath0 line toward irs4 indicates a wide profile as well as a co line .",
    "infalling and outflowing gas seem to be the causes of this wide line @xcite , and perhaps , both the effects are blended . in both position - velocity diagrams , the blueshifted component of the hco@xmath0 line is broader than redshifted component .",
    "this is identical to the tendency of co outflow , which indicates the wide hco@xmath0 line is mainly caused by the outflow .",
    "as in the hco@xmath0 channel map ( fig.[hcochmap ] ) , the blueshifted component extends to the west of irs4 , whereas redshifted component is elongated to the north .",
    "this aspect again corresponds with the morphology of the co outflow ( fig.[outflowcm ] ) .",
    "another method to use to determine what makes the wide line profile is to compare the velocity of infalling and outflowing gas .",
    "we calculated the free fall velocity of infalling gas , @xmath114  0.56 km s@xmath22 , assuming the mass range of 0.10  0.32 @xmath8 derived by @xcite , and a diameter of the envelope of @xmath115 pc .",
    "these @xmath116 are smaller than the line width , which indicates the outflow has a larger contribution to the wide line profiles .    toward irs6 , we derived some physical parameters of the outflow in the same procedure as for irs4 and show the result in table .",
    "[ outflowtables ] . in the case of irs6",
    ", we could not correct the effect of the inclination of the outflow axis because of a lack of information . besides",
    ", there have been no co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) observations toward irs6 in previous years , so we could not derive @xmath117 . here",
    "we use the same @xmath117 as toward irs4 .",
    "although there are ambiguities of inclination and optical depth , the outflow from irs6 is more than 1 order of magnitude smaller than that from irs4 .",
    "this is consistent with our estimation of its evolved status with a small envelope .",
    "this interpretation is not consistent with the young age of the outflow ; however , when the outflow is nearly in pole - on configuration , the dynamical timescale of the outflow will be calculated to be smaller than the true value .",
    "we need to know the inclination angle of this source to correct this mismatch .",
    "figure [ outflowit ] shows the blueshifted component of the outflow from the irs4 has negative spatial correlation with the continuum emission from cha - mms1 .",
    "the outflow seems to change its direction at the edge of the mms1 . in fig.[outflowcm ] , the outflow component with the highest velocity is distributed at the midpoint between irs4 and mms1 .",
    "in addition , the velocity of the outflow suddenly declines in front of mms1 ( fig.[pv9 ] ) , i.e. , the flow seems to be decelerated by mms1 .",
    "do these characteristics indicate that mms1 interacts with the outflow from irs4 ?    there were no emissions detected from shock tracer molecules in submillimeter wavelength in our observations .",
    "however , considering irs4 s low luminosity ( @xmath118 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , weak outflow properties , and high upper energy levels of @xmath119 k , it is conceivable that the outflow - core interaction could not increase the temperature enough to excite these molecules .",
    "we could not rule out that a weak interaction does occur .",
    "@xcite pointed out that outflows and radiation from the neighboring young stars have prospects for influencing the chemical processes in mms1 .",
    "here we considered the impact of the interaction from following two view - points .",
    "first we investigate momentum .",
    "here we compare the momentum brought by the outflow with gas momentum in mms1 .",
    "when an outflow with density @xmath120 and velocity @xmath121 is colliding with a surface of radius @xmath122 for a time duration @xmath123 , we can obtain the mass @xmath124 colliding in a unit of time and the momentum @xmath125 as , @xmath126 now we estimate the density of the outflow .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the outflow has a cone shape with a base diameter of 40@xmath59 (= 3.1 @xmath127 pc ) and a height of 60@xmath59 (= 4.7 @xmath128 pc ) judging from fig.[outflowit ] .",
    "calculating the density @xmath129 of the outflow from this assumption with the derived mass , we obtain @xmath130 g @xmath15 . assigning this density , radius @xmath131 pc and @xmath123 which equals the dynamical timescale of the flow ( @xmath132 yr ) to equation ( [ outflowmom ] ) , we derived a momentum of 0.88 @xmath8 km s@xmath22 .",
    "meanwhile , the momentum of gas in mms1 is calculated to be @xmath133 @xmath8 km s@xmath22 from the mass of 0.45 @xmath8 and the velocity of 0.34 km s@xmath22 derived from the h@xmath16co@xmath0 line profile , which is a combination of turbulence and thermal width , removing the contribution of the spectral resolution . as a result , @xmath125 is much larger than @xmath134 , which means the motion of the gas in mms1 is easily affected when the outflow collide with the core .",
    "although the mms1 contours in @xcite have an asymmetry , it is difficult to confirm the collisional impact on the geometry of mms1 with their map .",
    "but in our hco@xmath0 position - velocity diagram ( fig.[pv9 ] ) , we could find the sign of the kinematic motion of the outer gas of mms1 caused by the collision .",
    "the dip in the northern side of mms1 is slightly ( @xmath2 0.3 km s@xmath22 ) blueshifted , which results in the velocity gradient on the map .",
    "this gradient is consistent with the irs4 outflow direction .",
    "precise calculations of the momentum for this gradient is difficult with our data set , but in a rough upper limit estimation , the momentum for making this dip velocity gradient , @xmath135 , should be less than the product of the velocity difference and the whole mass of mms1 , @xmath136 km s@xmath22 . the momentum provided by the outflow is larger than @xmath135 ; thus , this outer gas motion could be excited by the interactions with the outflow .",
    "the other point of discussion is the time scale before induced star formation is triggered in mms1 .",
    "one example of outflow - triggered star formation is l1551 ne in taurus @xcite . in the case of mms1 , before star formation is triggered , it is necessary that a rise in pressure outside of mms1 by colliding with the outflow reaches the center of the core .",
    "the velocity of this propagation equals the sound speed , or the shock speed if a shock has been excited .",
    "the sound speed under 10 k is 0.19 km s@xmath22 . with this velocity ,",
    "the signal of the collision arrives at the center in @xmath137 yr .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude longer than the dynamical timescale of the outflow . under this condition ,",
    "triggered star formation would not have occurred yet .",
    "next , we also consider the case in which a shock exists . in order to derive the shock speed",
    ", we need to know the density structure around mms1 , because the shock speed depends on the difference between inner and outer density of mms1 .",
    "according to @xcite , the difference between the 1.3 mm continuum intensity at the center and outside of the mms1 is about a factor of 2 . under optically thin conditiona ,",
    "the difference of the intensity is identical to that of density , and the shock speed equals half of the outflow speed , 5.3 km s@xmath22 . with this speed , the shock would arrive at the center in @xmath138 yr from the point of the collision . considering the time to reach the boundary of mms1 from its departure from irs4 ,",
    "the time for the outflow to arrive at the center of mms1 is @xmath139 yr , about the same as the dynamical timescale of the outflow .",
    "if the estimate of density structure is correct , compression has just reached to the center of mms1 and collapse would just be triggered . considering that we could not detect any infall and outflow signature around the source ,",
    "it is possible that mms1 is in a very young stage of its evolution .",
    "we observed an yso condensation in the cederblad 110 region of the chamaeleon i dark cloud by co(@xmath1=3 - 2 ) , hco@xmath0(@xmath1=4 - 3 ) , h@xmath16co@xmath0(@xmath1=4 - 3 ) , ch@xmath17oh(@xmath1=@xmath18-@xmath19 ) , so(@xmath1=@xmath20-@xmath21 ) , and sio(@xmath1=8 - 7 ) submillimeter lines with the aste 10 m telescope .",
    "results are as follows .",
    "\\1 ) we found a dense hco@xmath0 clump .",
    "this clump is an aggregate made up of three components associated with irs4 , irs11 , and cha - mms1 .",
    "although these sub - components do not appear in the integrated intensity map , we can distinguish them in the channel map and the position - velocity diagrams .",
    "\\2 ) we detected co ( @xmath140 ) outflow components around irs4 and irs6 , but not around cha - mms1 , irs11 , or nir89 .",
    "our observations with high angular resolution show the outflows previously known in this region are launched by irs4 , not by mms1 .",
    "this result suggests mms1 is not a protostar but still in the prestellar phase .",
    "\\3 ) each hco@xmath0(@xmath1=4 - 3 ) line profile toward irs4 , irs11 , and mms1 all have `` red '' asymmetry instead of blue asymmetry , which is a marker of infalling gas .",
    "however , our result does not necessarily mean there is no infall in these young sources , because the outflows from irs4 and irs6 are direct evidences of gas infall .",
    "\\4 ) the blue - shifted outflow from irs4 seems to collide against mms1 .",
    "the outflow veers and the velocity declines just in front of mms1 . though emission lines from shock tracer molecules such as ch@xmath17oh , so , and sio are not detected , it is plausible because the outflow from irs4 is rather weak for excitation of these molecules .",
    "\\5 ) momentum calculations show the outflow from irs4 is strong enough to affect gas motion in mms1 , although the outflow is so young that the star formation process has not been triggered yet , or has just been triggered .",
    "this is consistent with the very young status of mms1 and the lack of any outflows , jets , and masers .",
    "we are grateful to all aste project members , particularly takeshi kamazaki and kazuyoshi sunada , for supporting the dual - frequency observations .",
    "observations with aste were in part carried out remotely from japan by using ntt s gemnet2 and its partner r&e ( research and education ) networks , which are based on accessnova collaboration of university of chile , ntt laboratories , and the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) .",
