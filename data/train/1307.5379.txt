    "properties of colloidal systems depend crucially on effective interactions between the colloid particles @xcite . for this reason",
    "a possibility of tuning these interactions by reversible changes of some control parameter is of a great interest in a colloidal science .",
    "temperature is a thermodynamic parameter that can be easily changed in a reversible manner , therefore temperature controlled thermodynamic casimir potential draws an increasing attention   @xcite .",
    "an importance of the casimir potential follows also from the fact that its range is given by the bulk correlation length , which diverges at the critical point of the fluid confined between the particles .",
    "recent experimental studies  @xcite suggest that also nature seems to take advantage of the casimir potential in life processes .",
    "the multicomponent lipid membranes in living organisms are close to the critical demixing point  @xcite , which should lead to the casimir potential between membrane proteins or other large inclusions .",
    "a very long range of attraction may explain why despite a very low concentration of the macromolecules , their aggregates can be formed .",
    "the thermodynamic casimir forces arise near the critical point of a fluid confined between two surfaces ( e.g. surfaces of particles ) as a result of critical fluctuations and they act between the confining surfaces @xcite .",
    "the critical point can be associated with : ( i ) a gas - liquid phase separation , ( ii ) in the case of complex fluids , e.g. colloidal suspensions with solvents including polymers or micelles , with a separation into phases poor and rich in these , so called depletion agents @xcite , ( iii ) or with a demixing transition in a binary or multicomponent mixture @xcite . in the latter two cases ,",
    "the critical temperature may be close to the room temperature .",
    "the emergence of the casimir interactions is directly related to the phenomenon of critical adsorption  @xcite at the confining surfaces . for an adsorbing surface , there is an excess density of the fluid in a surface layer of a thickness comparable with the bulk correlation length @xmath0 .",
    "when the critical point with the critical temperature @xmath1 is approached , then the bulk correlation length increases , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 for the three dimensional ( @xmath5 ) ising universality class , and @xmath6 is a material constant of the order of few angstroms @xcite . in the case of the demixing transition",
    ", a layer rich in the component @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is formed near the surface preferentially adsorbing the @xmath7-type molecules ( @xmath8-type molecules ) . when the distance between the two surfaces is @xmath9",
    ", then the adsorbed layers overlap and influence each other .",
    "the @xmath10-dependent modification of the density or concentration profile leads in turn to the @xmath10-dependent excess grand potential , i.e. the excess pressure .",
    "surfaces with the like adsorption preferences attract each other , whereas opposing adsorption preferences lead to a repulsion @xcite .",
    "close to the critical point , the potential of the casimir force is universal .",
    "it has a scaling form with a scaling function which is the same for surfaces with similar adsorption preferences , and the same for surfaces with opposite adsorption preferences , independently of the strength of the surface - fluid interaction @xmath11 . for @xmath12",
    "the casimir potential per unit area between parallel surfaces decays exponentially , @xmath13 , with different forms of the amplitude @xmath14 for like and unlike surfaces . according to ref.@xcite , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for like and opposite adsorption preferences respectively .",
    "one should note , however that the temperature range @xmath17 corresponding to the universal behavior shrinks with decreasing @xmath11 @xcite . in the case of weakly adsorbing surfaces ,",
    "the casimir potential can depend on @xmath11 for experimentally accessible range of @xmath18 @xcite .      in systems such as the colloidal suspensions , the van der waals and electrostatic interactions between the colloidal particles are also present .",
    "the former can be eliminated by a refractive - index matching .",
    "the latter can be screened by adding salt to the solution . in the case of",
    "two parallel charged surfaces with surface charges @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the solution containing ions , the electrostatic potential per unit area between them decays exponentially for large separations , @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the elementary charge , @xmath23 is the inverse debye screening length and @xmath24 is the number density of ions @xcite .",
    "when the screening length @xmath25 is comparable with @xmath0 , then the electrostatic repulsion between like surfaces competes with the casimir attraction .",
    "the sum of the two potentials , @xmath26 depends on the ratio of the decay rates @xmath27 and on the ratio of the amplitudes , @xmath28 . in the critical region and for small salt content , the two lengths are large , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the molecular size .",
    "the interesting phenomena occur if the separation between the surfaces is comparable with the two relevant length scales , @xmath31 .",
    "the potential per unit area between curved surfaces of colloid particles differs from ( [ v ] ) , but has the same qualitative features . for distances between the surfaces",
    "much smaller than the particles radii the form of the potential can be obtained in the derjaguin approximation @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the effective interactions arising from the sum in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) for the case of identical surfaces .",
    "when the correlation length is larger than the screening length ( @xmath32 ) and the surface charge is large , a repulsion at small separations @xmath10 crosses over to an attraction at large @xmath10 , so that @xmath33 has a minimum for @xmath9 . for surfaces with an area typical for colloid particles , the depth of the minimum can be as large as a few @xmath34 , which is enough for inducing phase transitions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath35 and for small @xmath28 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) that the casimir attraction at small separations @xmath10 crosses over to the electrostatic repulsion at large @xmath10 .",
    "if the emerging repulsion barrier between the colloid particles is sufficiently strong , the phase separation in the particle - rich and particle - poor phases due to the casimir attraction between particle surfaces  @xcite is suppressed .",
    "the resulting short - range attraction long - range repulsion ( salr ) effective potential can lead to the formation of dynamic spherical or elongated clusters , a network or layers of particles @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of oppositely charged surfaces with opposing preferential adsorption , e.g. , hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces , the casimir potential is repulsive whereas the coulomb potential is attractive ( in this case @xmath36 and @xmath37 in ( [ v ] ) ) .",
    "the sum of the two potentials can have a minimum or a maximum for separations @xmath9 , depending on @xmath38 and on @xmath28 . by varying the temperature and thereby changing the bulk correlation length @xmath0",
    ", one can cause the attractive well or the repulsive barrier in the effective potential to appear and to disappear .",
    "thus it seems possible to induce or to suppress a macro- or microphase separation by small temperature changes .",
    "indeed , analogs of the gas , liquid and crystal phases were induced and destroyed by temperature changes within @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "it seems that it is not enough to just add the casimir and the screened electrostatic potential in order to obtain the effective interactions between the surfaces .",
    "the total potential can strongly deviate form the sum of the casimir and the electrostatic potentials , even when no other interactions are present .",
    "the experimental results obtained in ref.@xcite for @xmath32 could not be fitted with eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) . only for distances",
    "much larger than the position of the potential minimum it was possible to fit the universal casimir potential with the experimental results , because for @xmath32 and @xmath40 the electrostatic contribution is negligible .",
    "in another experiment @xcite an attraction was measured between like charge hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces for some temperature range corresponding to @xmath35 . both the electrostatic and the casimir potentials are repulsive , and according to eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) should lead together to enhanced repulsion .",
    "the experimental result of ref.@xcite is in complete disagreement with eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "the above strong quantitative @xcite and even qualitative @xcite disagreement between eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) and the experiment show that in order to design effective interactions it is necessary to develop a more accurate theory .",
    "several attempts have been made already , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the critical point in ref.@xcite was associated with the water - lutidine phase separation .",
    "in ref.@xcite the ions come from dissociation of water , and in ref.@xcite , @xmath41 was added .",
    "a solubility of the ions in water is much bigger than in the lutidine .",
    "the water - rich phase is thus rich in ions , whereas the lutidine - rich phase is poor in ions . as mentioned in the passing , near the hydrophobic surface an excess of lutidine in a layer of thickness @xmath42",
    "is predicted by the theory of critical adsorption @xcite .",
    "if this surface is charged , then the excess number density of ions in a layer of thickness @xmath43 is predicted by the debye - hckel theory @xcite .",
    "however , because of much lower solubility of the ions in lutidine than in water , a simultaneous excess density of lutidine and of ions near the surface is associated with a large internal - energy penalty . the distribution of the ions as well as the solvent composition near the surface must be a compromise between the bulk tendency to separate the ions from the lutidine , and the surface preference to attract both immiscible components . as found in ref.@xcite , when @xmath35 a thin lutidine - rich layer can be formed at the hydrophobic surface , but this layer is followed by a layer rich in water and ions .",
    "thus , in the critical region the charged hydrophobic surface behaves as an _ effectively hydrophilic _ one .",
    "the casimir potential between hydrophilic surfaces is attractive .",
    "for this reason weakly charged surfaces can attract each other .",
    "the above physical picture is consistent with the theory developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the theory was derived from a microscopic lattice gas model for a four component mixture , and also from a simple density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "we took into account van der waals ( vdw ) type of interactions between all the components in addition to the coulomb interactions between the ions .",
    "we have assumed that the vdw interactions between the cation and a given specie is the same as the vdw interaction between the anion and this specie .",
    "similar assumption was made for the interactions with the surfaces .",
    "after a systematic coarse - graining procedure appropriate in the critical region , a landau - type functional , containing also the electrostatic energy contribution was obtained . in this theory",
    "the dominant contribution to the effective interaction between the surfaces is similar to eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "however , because of the mutual influence of the solvent composition and the charge distribution , @xmath44 and @xmath7 should be replaced by the amplitudes that both depend on surface charges , fluid - wall interactions and on the ratio of the decay lengths @xmath38 . moreover ,",
    "additional terms , @xmath45 for @xmath35 and @xmath46 $ ] for @xmath32 should be included .",
    "for @xmath32 , corresponding to the experiment in ref.@xcite , a satisfactory quantitative agreement was obtained for 4 different combination of surfaces in ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the fluid - wall interactions could not be determined experimentally , and were used as fitting parameters .",
    "importantly , in each case the best fits were obtained for @xmath47 , in perfect agreement with recent measurements @xcite by the same group that performed the experiment in ref.@xcite .",
    "there were other attempts to explain the discrepancies between eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) and the experimental results  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the phenomenological landau - type functional was developed by adding the landau functional for the critical solvent and the free energy of the ions .",
    "in addition , terms describing the coupling of the density of the anions and the cations with the solvent composition were included .",
    "the unusual attraction between like charge hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was obtained in these theories as a result of different solubility of the anion and the cation in water , and different interactions of the two ionic species with the surfaces .",
    "presumably both effects play some role in experiments @xcite . since only our theory agrees quantitatively with the experiment @xcite , we believe that it captures the key physical phenomena of the confined near - critical mixture containing ions with preferential solubility in one of the solvent components .    the preliminary results presented in ref.@xcite concerned only like charge hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces , as in the experimental studies  @xcite . in this work",
    "a systematic and complete analysis of all possible combination of selectivity and surface charges of the two confining surfaces is presented within the theory developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the theory is further simplified , and in the new version the essential physics is amplified .",
    "we introduce the order parameter ( op ) suitable for the phase separation into a phase rich in water and ions , and a phase rich in lutidine and poor in ions .",
