    "does a self - adjoint operator canonically conjugate with a semibounded hamiltonian exist ?",
    "this operator , if it exists , has been referred to as time operator .",
    "the general concensus is that no such operator exists ( toller 1997 , 1999 ; pegg 1998 ; atmanspacher & amann 1998 ; giannitrapani 1997 ; eisenberg & horwitz 1997 ; delgado & muga 1997 ; blanchard & jadczyk 1996 ; omnes 1994 ; holland 1993 ; park 1984 ; srinivas & vijayalakshmi 1981 ; holevo 1978 ; cohen - tannoudji 1977 ; jammer 1974 ; olhovsky & recami 1974 ; rosenbaum 1969 ; gotfried 1966 ; pauli 1926 , 1933 , 1958 ) .",
    "this pessimism traces back to the well - known theorem of pauli ( pauli 1926 , 1933 , 1958 ) which asserts that the existence of a self - adjoint time operator canonically conjugate to a given hamiltonian implies that the hamiltonian has an absolutely continous spectrum filling the entire real line .",
    "thus for the generally semibounded and discrete hamiltonian of quantum mechanics , pauli s theorem excludes the possibility of developing a quantum theory of time via quantum operators .",
    "this conclusion has been corroborated by succeeding attempts to introduce time operators , particularly for the free particle in the real line where quantization of the classical arrival or passage times has led to maximally symmetric , non - self - adjoint time opertor ( muga & leavens 2000 ; egusquiza & muga 1999 ; delgado & muga 1997 ; grot _ et al _ 1996 ; alcock 1969_a_,_b _ ; fick & engelmann 1963 , 1964 ; paul 1962 ) .",
    "thus it has been tacitly assumed that if one attempts to introduce time in standard quantum mechanics ( sqm ) as an operator canonically conjugate to a semibounded hamiltonian , discrete or not , one has to expect that the time operator to be generally maximally symmetric without any self - adjoint extension ( jammer 1974 ) .",
    "thus it has been the current thinking that time operators will generally be meaningful only when the axioms of sqm are modified to include povm - observables , in which case time is a povm - observable ( egusquiza & muga 1999 ; toller 1999 , 1997 ; giannitrapani 1997 ; busch _ et al _ 1995_a_,_b _ , 1994 ; srinivas & vijayalakshmi 1981 ; holevo 1978 ; helstrom 1970 ; toller 1999 , 1997 ) .",
    "however , in a recent publication , we have explicitly demonstrated that pauli s theorem does not hold within sqm , and there is no a priori reason to exclude the existence of self - adjoint time operators canonically conjugate to a semibounded hamiltonian ( galapon 2002 ) .",
    "for this reason , it is imperative to look back and investigate the existence of self - adjoint time operators for quantum mechanical systems . in this paper , we prove explicitly that to every discrete , semibounded hamiltonian with constant degeneracy and with finite sum of the squares of the reciprocal of its eigenvalues and whose eigenvectors span the entire hilbert space there exists a characteristic self - adjoint time operator which is canonically conjugate to the hamiltonian in a dense subspace of the hilbert space . by _",
    "characteristic _ we mean that the operator is parameter free and is solely constructed from the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian , i.e. from the hamiltonian eigenvectors and eigenvalues alone .",
    "moreover , we will show that each characteristic self - adjoint time operator generates a class of uncountably many self - adjoint time operators canonically conjugate with the same hamiltonian .",
    "incidentally our results belie earlier claims that no self - adjoint time operators exists for discrete hamiltonian systems ( pegg 1998 ; canata and ferrari 1991_a , b _ ; jordan 1927 ) .    our method of proof will follow that of the physicist s intuition : we formally construct an operator with a dimension of time out of the spectral resolution of the hamiltonian , then show that , under some mild conditions , it can be assigned a dense subspace to lift its formality , then show that it is canonically conjugate with the hamiltonian in a dense subspace of the hilbert space , then finally show that the operator in its assigned domain is essentially self - adjoint  thus with a uniquely associated self - adjoint operator .",
    "let @xmath0 be a non - degenerate hamiltonian whose orthonormal eigenkets are @xmath1 , and corresponding eigenvalues , ordered in increasing size , are @xmath2 , for all @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the hilbert space of the system corresponding to the given hamiltonian is spanned by the eigenkets of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 where @xmath6 is equiped with the standard norm @xmath7 derived from the standard inner product @xmath8 . under this representation , the hamiltonian @xmath4 with domain @xmath9",
    "is explicitly given by @xmath10 @xmath11    given the eigenkets @xmath1 s and the eigenvalues @xmath2 s , we construct the following formal symmetric operator , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and the prime indicates a double summation with the @xmath14 contribution excluded from the sum .",
    "we note that @xmath15 has a dimension of time and it is only constructed out of the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian without the need of introducing any parameter . in the following we show that if the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian satisfies the condition @xmath16 then the formal operator @xmath15 can be assigned a dense subspace in @xmath6 , and it is canonically conjugate with the hamiltonian in some dense subspace of @xmath6 , and it is essentially self - adjoint in its assigned domain . for this reason we call @xmath17 as the characteristic time operator for the non - degenerate hamiltonian .",
    "now we prove that if condition ( [ 3concon ] ) is satisfied , then @xmath17 can be assigned the following dense subspace @xmath18 as its domain .",
    "the subspace @xmath19 is dense because for every @xmath20 in @xmath6 there exists a sequence of vectors in @xmath19 which converges to @xmath20 . in particular the sequence of vectors",
    "@xmath21 in @xmath19 converges to @xmath20 .",
    "we first show that the formal time operator @xmath17 is defined in the entire @xmath19 .",
    "that means for every @xmath22 in @xmath19 the vector @xmath23 belongs in the hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath22 be in @xmath19 , then @xmath24 @xmath23 belongs to the hilbert space @xmath25 if and only if @xmath26 , or equivalently , @xmath27 let us divide the sum in two parts , @xmath28 the first term in equation ( [ zak ] ) is already finite for finite @xmath29 so that we need only to show that the second term is finite .",
    "using the triangle inequality , we get the bound , @xmath30 since @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",
    "we note that @xmath33 is bounded within the range @xmath34 for every @xmath35 .",
    "thus there exists a finite positive constant @xmath36 depending on @xmath29 alone such that @xmath37 one such constant is given by @xmath38 thus we finally arrive at the upperbound @xmath39 which is finite as the sum @xmath40 is assumed finite .",
    "since @xmath22 is an arbitrary element of @xmath19 , the bound ( [ sese ] ) holds for all vectors in @xmath19 .",
    "therefore @xmath23 belongs to @xmath25 for all @xmath22 in @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath15 is defined in @xmath19 and @xmath19 is dense , we define @xmath15 to be the densely defined operator @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the formality of @xmath15 has thus been lifted .",
    "now we claim that the pair of operators @xmath4 and @xmath15 form a canonical pair in a dense subspace @xmath43 of @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 for all @xmath22 in @xmath46 .",
    "let us assume for the moment that @xmath44 is not empty .",
    "then if @xmath22 is in @xmath44 , we have @xmath47 now if @xmath48 then @xmath49 . in which case equation ( [ cancan ] ) reduces to @xmath50 that is @xmath17 and @xmath0 satisfy the canonical commutation relation if and only if there is a subspace of @xmath44 satisfying equation ( [ concon ] ) .",
    "we then have to identify a dense subspace of @xmath51 satisfying condition ( [ concon ] ) and at the same time belonging to @xmath44 .",
    "now we show that the vectors of the following proper subspace of @xmath51 satisfy all these requirements , @xmath52 first let s demonstrate that the vectors in @xmath53 satisfy equation ( [ concon ] ) .",
    "expanded in the basis @xmath1 , the vectors @xmath22 in @xmath53 assume the form , @xmath54 provided we set @xmath55 when either @xmath56 or @xmath57 is outside of its respective range , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ; or when both are outside of their ranges ; or when @xmath60 . taking the sum of the coefficients , we have @xmath61 the sum vanishes because rearrangement of the first term in the second line leads to the equality @xmath62 .",
    "now @xmath43 is dense .",
    "let us assume otherwise .",
    "then there exists a vector @xmath20 in @xmath6 with @xmath63 such that @xmath64 for all @xmath22 in @xmath43 .",
    "now since @xmath65 is in @xmath43 for every pair @xmath66 , we must have @xmath67 for all such pairs of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that @xmath68 or @xmath69 for all pairs of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this means that if @xmath70 for some fixed @xmath57 , then the rest of the coefficients will have to be zero , which implies that @xmath71 , contrary to the assumption that @xmath72 . on the other hand if @xmath73 for some non - vanishing comlex number @xmath74 and for some @xmath57 , then @xmath75 for all @xmath56 ; but then @xmath76 which does not belong to @xmath6 , contrary to the assumption that @xmath20 is in @xmath6 . thus if @xmath67 for all @xmath56 and @xmath57 for some @xmath20 in @xmath6 , then @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath43 is dense .",
    "now we show that @xmath43 is a subspace of @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath43 is a proper subspace of @xmath51 and @xmath51 is invariant under @xmath4 ( that means @xmath78 is a subspace of @xmath51 ) , @xmath79 is defined in the entire @xmath43 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath51 is not invariant under @xmath17 so that it is not necessary that @xmath80 is in @xmath9 for all @xmath22 in @xmath43 . now @xmath81 consists of those @xmath82 in @xmath51 such that @xmath83 is in @xmath9 .",
    "specifically the domain consists of those @xmath82 in @xmath51 such that @xmath84 to find the suitable condition to determine the domain of @xmath85 , we split the sum in two parts , @xmath86 for finite @xmath29 the first term is already finite , so again we need only to concern ourselves with the second term .",
    "if the @xmath22 s satisfy the bound @xmath87 for some constant @xmath88 independent of @xmath89 , then @xmath22 belongs to @xmath81 .    it is sufficient then to show that the vectors in @xmath43 satisfy ( [ cond2 ] ) to establish that @xmath43 is a proper dense subspace of @xmath81 .",
    "now @xmath90 where the second line follows from a rearrangement of the first term . the triangle inequality",
    "then dictates that @xmath91 again @xmath33 is bounded within the range @xmath92 for every @xmath93 .",
    "thus there exists a finite positive constant @xmath94 depending on @xmath95 alone such that @xmath96 one such @xmath94 is explicitly given by @xmath97 thus we get the required bound of inequality ( [ cond2 ] ) @xmath98 which implies that @xmath43 is a subspace of @xmath44 .",
    "the operators @xmath4 and @xmath15 are then canonically conjugate in the dense subspace @xmath43 .",
    "now we show that @xmath15 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "let @xmath99 be the adjoint of @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath15 in @xmath51 is essentially self - adjoint if @xmath82 is in @xmath100 and @xmath101 imply that @xmath102 ( reed & simon 1972 ) .",
    "however , it is sufficient to show that @xmath15 and its adjoint @xmath99 are symmetric .",
    "this is so because the symmetry of @xmath15 , with the fact that @xmath15 is densely defined , assures the existence of a unique non - trivial adjoint of @xmath15 , @xmath99 ; on the other hand , the symmetry of @xmath99 dictates that @xmath99 has real eigenvalues only . if @xmath99 is symmetric , and if @xmath103 is in @xmath100 and @xmath101 , then @xmath82 is an eigenvector of @xmath99 with the eigenvalues @xmath104 which is a contradiction with the assumption that @xmath99 is symmetric .",
    "first we show that @xmath17 is symmetric in its assigned domain @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath15 is symmetric if @xmath105 for all @xmath22 , @xmath20 in @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath106 in @xmath51 .",
    "now @xmath107 where the rearrangement of the summations are possible because they have finite limits .",
    "thus @xmath17 is symmetric in its assigned domain .",
    "now let us determine the adjoint , @xmath99 , of @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath15 is densely defined and symmetric , it has a unique non - trivial adjoint .",
    "the domain @xmath100 of @xmath99 consists of those vectors @xmath20 in @xmath6 such that there exists a vector @xmath108 in @xmath6 satisfying the condition @xmath109 for all @xmath22 in @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath110 be in @xmath6 .",
    "then for all @xmath22 in @xmath51 , @xmath111 since @xmath95 is finite , the interchanging of the order of summation in the second line is allowed . with @xmath112 , we can rewrite equation ( [ 3rekrek ] ) in the form @xmath113 from which we identify the vector @xmath114 to satisfy the relation @xmath115 for all @xmath22 in @xmath51 .",
    "now @xmath20 is in the domain of @xmath99 if and only if @xmath108 is in the hilbert space .",
    "thus the domain @xmath100 of @xmath116 must comprise the following subspace of @xmath6 , @xmath117 finally the adjoint of @xmath15 is uniquely determined by the definition of the adjoint , @xmath118 .",
    "equation ( [ 3star ] ) then yields the adjoint @xmath119 as expected from the symmetry of @xmath15 , we have the extension relation @xmath120 .",
    "( it may be possible that @xmath121 already for some systems , in which case @xmath15 is immediately self - adjoint . )    to complete the proof that @xmath15 is essentially self - adjoint , we now show that its adjoint @xmath122 is symmetric .",
    "it is sufficient to show that for every @xmath20 in @xmath123 the number @xmath124 is real valued .",
    "let @xmath20 be in @xmath123 , then @xmath125 we note that the double sum in equation ( [ 3sum ] ) is absolutely convergent .",
    "this follows from the fact that the first summation is already absolutely convergent , @xmath126 being uniquely determined by @xmath20 , and @xmath127 it is well known that if a double sum has been proven to be absolutely convergent for any mode of summation , it will be absolutely convergent for all modes of summation , and the sum of the series is independent of summation ( hardy _ et al _ 1952 ) .",
    "thus we can interchange the order of summation in the right hand side of equation ( [ 3sum ] ) to give @xmath128 thus @xmath116 is symmetric .",
    "and @xmath15 is consequently essentially self - adjoint .",
    "now we show that @xmath15 generates a class of uncountable essentially self - adjoint time operators conjugate to the same hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath129 be a bounded sequence of real numbers , i.e. @xmath130 for all @xmath89 ; these sequences may satisfy some other properties such as @xmath131 , or @xmath132 for all @xmath89 for some real @xmath133 .",
    "then the operator @xmath134 is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , @xmath135 is canonically conjugate with @xmath4 in @xmath43 . to prove our assertion ,",
    "let @xmath136 .",
    "obviously @xmath137 is symmetric in @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath135 is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath51 if there exists some constants @xmath138 such that @xmath139 for all @xmath22 in @xmath51 ( hellwig 1964 ) . for bounded @xmath140 ,",
    "the operator @xmath137 is bounded ; this follows from the fact that @xmath141 .",
    "thus there exists some @xmath138 such that @xmath142 , for all @xmath22 in @xmath51 ; a pair of such @xmath143 and @xmath144 is @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "therefore @xmath135 is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath51 .",
    "that @xmath147 and @xmath4 are canonical in @xmath43 follows from the fact that @xmath15 are canonical in @xmath43 , and @xmath148 and @xmath4 commute in @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the above construction of @xmath149 does not necessarilly exhaust all possibilities .",
    "however , we emphasize that not all symmetric operators in @xmath51 ( not even those that are essentially self - adjoint or self - adjoint in @xmath51 ) which commute with the hamiltonian in @xmath43 can be added to @xmath17 to give an essentially self - adjoint time operator in @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath17 is bounded and if @xmath149 is unbounded in @xmath51 , then no constants @xmath150 can satisfy @xmath139 for all @xmath22 in @xmath51 because for every @xmath143 and @xmath144 there will always be a @xmath20 in @xmath51 such that @xmath151 , @xmath152 being unbounded and the right hand side of the inequality being always bounded for bounded @xmath17 .",
    "now let us consider the case when the hamiltonian has a constant degeneracy @xmath153 , i.e. to every energy eigenvalue @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath153 linearly independent and orthonormal eigenvectors , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 , in which @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",

    "similarly , @xmath168 has a dimension of time and it is solely constructed out of the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian alone .",
    "similarly we will show below that if the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian satisfies the condition @xmath169 then the formal operator @xmath170 can be assigned a dense subspace in @xmath159 , and it is canonically conjugate with the hamiltonian in some dense subspace of @xmath159 , and it is essentially self - adjoint in its assigned domain .",
    "likewise we call @xmath171 as the characteristic time operator for the m - degenerate hamiltonian .",

    "then there exists a vector @xmath238 in @xmath239 which is not the zero vector such that @xmath240 ( we can always rescale in units such that we do nt need to be bothered with units in ( [ 3man ] ) . ) inserting the explicit expansion of @xmath241 and using the representation of @xmath230 given by ( [ 3mad ] ) in equation ( [ 3man ] ) , yield @xmath242 for every @xmath243 and @xmath222 . since @xmath241 is asserted to exist , the summation in ( [ 3ekek ] ) must converge absolutely for all @xmath243 and for every @xmath222 , including the limit @xmath244 .",
    "now for two different values of @xmath222 , say @xmath200 and @xmath245 , we get the two coupled equations , @xmath246 subtracting equation ( [ 22 ] ) from equation ( [ 11 ] ) gives @xmath247 since @xmath20 belongs to the hilbert space , we must have @xmath248 .",
    "now where is the contradiction ?",
    "we note that @xmath159 is a direct sum of @xmath153 hilbert spaces spanned separately by the @xmath153 degenerate eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath249 , where @xmath250 for all @xmath251 is spanned by @xmath252 , @xmath157 .",
    "let @xmath253 be the projection operator unto the subspace @xmath250 .",
    "then each of the subspaces @xmath254 , @xmath255 , is invariant under the hamiltonian ; and these subspaces consequently reduce the hamiltonain . then the restriction @xmath256 of the hamiltonian @xmath162 on @xmath250 is a self - adjoint , nondegerate hamiltonian on @xmath250 with the same eigenvalues @xmath2 as the eigenvalues of the original hamiltonain @xmath162 . since @xmath257 , for some fixed @xmath222 we can construct the following characteristic time operator for the non - degenerate hamiltonian @xmath258 on @xmath250 , @xmath259 @xmath260 @xmath261 has all the properties as those considered in the non - degenerate case ; and it is , most importantly , essentially self - adjoint .",
    "thus there exists no @xmath262 in @xmath263 different from the zero vector such that @xmath264 .",
    "had such a vector existed , then its coefficients @xmath265 s , not all vanishing , would have satisfied the equation @xmath266 however , if @xmath171 is not essentially self - adjoint then it is possible that @xmath267 for some @xmath89 , which implies that ( [ 3cond3 ] ) has a non - trivial solution since we can choose @xmath268 , owing from the fact that @xmath248 .",
    "but this is in contradiction with the essential self - adjointness of @xmath269 .    therefore in order to maintain the equality in equation ( [ kawkaw ] ) and avoid any contradiction , we must have @xmath270 for all @xmath200 and @xmath245 for every @xmath89 , i.e. @xmath271 . then for all @xmath222 , equation ( [ 3ekek ] ) reduces to @xmath272 but equation ( [ 3wawa ] ) is equivalent to equation ( [ 3cond3 ] ) only that the hamiltonian is scaled to @xmath273 . again because @xmath241 belongs to the hilbert space which implies @xmath274 , the assertion that @xmath171 is not essentially self - adjoint implies that the charateristic time operator corresponding to ( [ 3wawa ] ) is not essentially self - adjoint , which is a contradiction with our earlier result for non - degenerate hamiltonians .",
    "thus we must necessarilly have @xmath275 for all @xmath89 and @xmath276 , implying that @xmath241 is the zero vector , contrary to the assumption that it is otherwise .",
    "therefore @xmath171 must be essentially self - adjoint in its assigned domain .",
    "as in the non - degenerate case , the characteristic time operator @xmath168 generates a class of uncountable essentially self - adjoint operator canonically conjugate with the same hamilotnian @xmath195 .",
    "now let @xmath277 be a bounded sequence of real numbers in @xmath89 for every @xmath276 , i.e. @xmath278 for all @xmath89 and @xmath276 .",
    "then the operator @xmath279 is essentially self - adjoint in @xmath196 .",
    "moreover , @xmath280 is canonically conjugate with @xmath195 in @xmath187 .",
    "we can follow the same line of proof as the one we used in the non - degenerate case to prove our assertation .",
    "we note that the argument found in ( pegg 1998 ) and ( jordan 1927 ) on the non - existence of self - adjoint time operators for discrete hamiltonians assumes that the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian belong to the domain @xmath187 for all @xmath281 .",
    "the eigenvectors , however , lie outside of @xmath187 , so that no contradiction arises .",
    "the essential self - adjointness of @xmath171 ( for all @xmath282 ) means that there exists a unique self - adjoint operator @xmath283 whose reduction in @xmath196 is @xmath171 itself .",
    "equivalently @xmath284 is the unique self - adjoint extention of @xmath171 .",
    "similarly , for every bounded sequence @xmath285 , there exists a unique self - adjoint operator @xmath286 whose reduction in @xmath196 is @xmath287 .",
    "because @xmath284 and @xmath288 are extensions of @xmath171 and @xmath280 , respectively , they remain canonically conjugate with the hamiltonian @xmath162 in the same dense subspace @xmath289 .",
    "the self - adjoint operators @xmath290 and @xmath288 are just the adjoints @xmath291 and @xmath292 , respectively .",
    "thus , in this paper , we have explicitly proven the following      1 .",
    "it has a pure point spectrum bounded from below which can be ordered according to size , i.e. @xmath294 , 2 .",
    "it has a constant finite degeneracy @xmath282 , 3 .",
    "the sum of the reciprocal of the square of its eigenvalues is finite , i.e @xmath295 , 4 .",
    "its eigenvectors span the entire hilbert space .",
    "then there exists a self - adjoint time operator @xmath296 characteristic of the system which is canonically conjugate with the hamiltonian in a dense subspace of @xmath297 , i.e. @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the identity of the hilbert space @xmath300 .",
    "moreover , @xmath296 generates a class of uncountably many other self - adjoint time operators canonically conjugate with the same hamiltonian in the same dense proper subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "one might notice that the above theorem implicitly assumes that the hamiltonian has no zero eigenvalue .",
    "but the above theorem can be extended without difficulty to hamiltonians with zero eigenvalues .",
    "one only needs to modify condition ( 3 ) to require _ that the sum of the reciprocal of the non - vanishing eigenvalues is finite_.the construction of the characteristic time operator and the class it generates are the same as in the cases considered here .",
    "we mention that the bounded and self - adjoint operator canonically conjugate with the number operator constructed by garisson and wong ( 1970 ) , and galindo ( 1984 ) is an example ( see also busch 1995_a_,_b _ ) .",
    "to conclude , we give a class of characteristic time operators .",
    "consider the class of characteristic time operators distinguished by the following requirement further imposed upon the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , @xmath301 we note that when ( [ compact ] ) is satisfied , the condition @xmath257 is automatically satisfied . under this condition ,",
    "the characteristic essentially self - adjoint time operator for both degenerate and non - degenerate hamiltonians admits a bounded and compact self - adjoint extension .",
    "the boundedness of @xmath171 for every finite @xmath281 follows from the following inequality , @xmath302 for every @xmath22 in @xmath303 .",
    "the boundedness of @xmath171 means that it can be extended in the entire hilbert space . and since @xmath171 is symmetric , it is self - adjoint in the entire @xmath300 .",
    "the compactness of @xmath171 for every finite @xmath281 can be shown in the configuration space representation in which @xmath171 assumes the form of a fredholm integral operator with square integrable kernel .",
    "that is for every @xmath304 in the domain of @xmath171 in configuration space representation , we have @xmath305 where the respective kernels for non - degenerate and m - degenerate hamiltonians are given by @xmath306 @xmath307 when the energy eigenvalues satisfy equation ( [ compact ] ) , these kernels are square integrable : @xmath308 @xmath309 we know that such operators are compact .",
    "the compactness of @xmath171 , coupled with its self - adjointness , means that @xmath171 has discrete spectrum and its eigenvectors span the entire @xmath300 ."
