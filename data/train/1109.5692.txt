    "one of the triumphs of modern cosmology is the success the hierarchical formation model has had in explaining the observed large scale structure of galaxies . in this model ,",
    "small - scale perturbations in the matter density distribution at early epochs intensify due to the effects of gravity , collapse and merge together to form the galaxies , groups , and clusters observed at later epochs . since clusters are the structures to form last , the process of hierarchical formation is expected to reveal itself dramatically in such systems .",
    "this is borne out by observations , where many clusters in the local universe are found to have recently undergone significant growth via either a major merger with another cluster or through minor mergers with smaller clusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "this offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of large scale structure formation on the constituent galaxies and intra cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "however , both the detection and distinction of clusters undergoing major or minor mergers can be an observationally expensive exercise in the absence of easily detectable signatures of each process @xcite .    in this vein ,",
    "the `` cold fronts '' first detected and characterized by the _ chandra _",
    "x - ray satellite @xcite , thanks to its excellent sensitivity and unrivalled spatial resolution , may play an important role .",
    "cold fronts are contact discontinuities in the icm which form at abrupt interfaces between low and high entropy plasma ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    ". in the scenario put forth by @xcite , commonly referred to as the `` remnant core '' scenario , the edges delineate the low entropy gas of two cool cores , which have just survived a pericentric passage , and the surrounding hot shocked atmospheres which were stripped from the cores during the merger .",
    "this remnant core scenario is observed in a number of clusters , e.g. , 1es0657 - 558 ( otherwise known as the bullet cluster ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , abell  1758 @xcite , abell  115 @xcite , abell  2744 @xcite , abell  2146 @xcite and probably abell  2069 @xcite . as the number of clusters observed by _",
    "chandra _",
    "increased , two things emerged ( i)-the remnant core scenario can not explain the majority of the observed cold fronts , and ( ii)-there is a clear dichotomy when considering the x - ray morphology of clusters hosting cold fronts @xcite .",
    "one subset of cold front clusters exhibit clearly disturbed x - ray morphologies , while the second subset have cool cores and appear relaxed at large radii .",
    "the disturbed morphology present in the former subset is clearly related to major merger activity which manifests itself at other wavelengths .",
    "the cold fronts due to the remnant core scenario are generally found in these clusters , but other merger - related processes also produce cold fronts ( e.g. , the  ram pressure slingshot  feature in abell  168 reported by * ? ? ? * see also @xcite for different cold fronts produced in merger simulations ) . in these cases ,",
    "cold fronts are excellent signatures of major merger activity @xcite . for the subset with relaxed large scale x - ray morphologies ,",
    "the best evidence for merger activity comes from the observed cold fronts  the evidence for merger activity at other wavelengths in these clusters is generally ambiguous or non - existent .",
    "the leading hypothesis for the formation of cold fronts in clusters with a regular x - ray morphology is the relative motion of the low entropy core gas  termed `` sloshing '' by @xcite  with respect to the quasi - static cluster potential .",
    "the simulations of @xcite and @xcite showed that a gravitational perturbation in the form of an infalling subcluster without a gaseous atmosphere can induce long - lasting oscillations of the the dark matter and gas cores . while the precise details differ ( e.g. , in the @xcite scenario , the dark matter oscillates , dragging the gas with it , while in @xcite the dark matter is nearly static while the gas oscillates ) in all cases the relative motion of low entropy cool core gas with respect to the cluster on larger scales produces cold fronts where it meets the higher entropy gas at larger radii .",
    "hydrodynamical perturbations in the form of minor merger - related weak shocks @xcite , shocks from fast moving galaxies @xcite , or acoustic - gravity waves related to bulk motions outside of the cluster cores @xcite have also been investigated by simulations . in these scenarios ,",
    "the core gas is displaced from the static dark matter core and oscillates around the potential minimum as the system relaxes back to its equilibrium configuration .",
    "several authors have suggested that outbursts from agn may provide a sufficient perturbation to induce sloshing @xcite although this possibility is yet to be fully explored .",
    "the emerging consensus is that the cold fronts seen in relaxed appearing cluster are due to minor merger activity .",
    "this leads to the interesting implication that cold fronts can be used as both a signpost of merger activity and , in combination with x - ray morphology , a tool to differentiate clusters undergoing major and minor mergers .",
    "much of the focus on sloshing cold front clusters has been at x - ray wavelengths or has involved simulations designed to explore mechanisms which are capable of reproducing the cold fronts along with a relaxed morphology at larger radii . to date , no studies have focused on identifying possible perturbers by utilizing the spatial and kinematic information provided by multiobject spectroscopy ( mos)an issue critical to the minor merger scenario where a recently merged perturber is not apparent at x - ray wavelengths , but may manifest itself as a dynamical substructure . here , we set out to address this problem using the powerful combination of spatial and redshift information provided by multiobject spectroscopy in an attempt to detect merger related substructure and characterize its dynamical properties .",
    "such observations are a crucial test for constraining simulations and for showing that cold fronts are excellent probes of ongoing merger activity . in this paper",
    "we present and analyze comprehensive mos observations of the sloshing cold front clusters abell  2142 and rxj1720.1 + 2638 ( hereafter a2142 and rxj1720 , respectively ) which were selected from the subsample of relaxed appearing cold front clusters in @xcite .",
    "previous mos follow up of cold front clusters taken from the disturbed subset in @xcite has demonstrated that mos observations are an essential ingredient required for understanding the merging history of a cluster @xcite .",
    "a2142 was one of the first clusters targeted with the _ chandra _  x - ray telescope and , along with the observations of abell  3667 @xcite , characterized for the first time the cold front phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "x - ray images of a2142 presented in @xcite , revealed an asymmetric x - ray morphology , while their analysis of 103 spectroscopically confirmed members of this cluster yielded a mean redshift of @xmath0 and a velocity dispersion @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite performed a dressler - schectman test @xcite and found marginal evidence for dynamical substructure , while their data also revealed a high peculiar velocity for the second ranked member of @xmath3@xmath2 .",
    "x - ray observations using rosat revealed a highly elliptical x - ray morphology with a luminous compact core , the centroid of which is offset from that of the larger scale emission @xcite .",
    "the temperature map of @xcite showed that this compact core was cooler than the surrounding gas and that the temperature distribution was asymmetric on large scales .",
    "the high ellipticity , offset core , asymmetric temperature distribution and evidence for dynamical structure were interpreted by both @xcite and @xcite as evidence for a later stage merger ( i.e. , viewed @xmath4gyr after the merger ) in a2142 .",
    "hints of a substructure to the northwest of the core in a2142 are seen in the weak lensing and sz maps presented in @xcite , and also the lensing data of @xcite .",
    "rxj1720 was categorized as an extended x - ray source in the _ einstein _ slew survey @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _  observations of rxj1720 revealed two cold fronts within 100 of the cluster center , while the x - ray emission outside of this radius showed a regular morphology @xcite .",
    "these _ chandra _  observations of rxj1720 provided the first clear indication that cold fronts can also be found in relaxed appearing cool core clusters .",
    "@xcite interpreted the cold fronts as evidence for either a late stage major merger viewed after several pericentric passages or the asynchronous collapse of two nearly cospatial density perturbations with different linear scales . using a deeper _ chandra _  observation , @xcite found that the spiral features revealed in the temperature and residual maps are more readily explained by the sloshing scenario .",
    "@xcite also reported an interesting correlation between the spiral structure and radio emission from a mini - halo and suggested that the origin of this diffuse radio emission may be related to the sloshing process .",
    "at optical wavelengths , rxj1720 was detected with the c4 cluster finding algorithm using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite . from 26",
    "spectroscopically confirmed cluster members @xcite measured a mean redshift of @xmath5 and a velocity dispersion @xmath6@xmath2 while the dressler - schectman test revealed no evidence for dynamical substructure .",
    "the projected mass maps from the weak lensing analysis of @xcite showed that rxj1720 harbors a second mass condensation just north of the main cluster component which is indicative of merger activity .",
    "for both clusters there are tantalizing hints for merger activity .",
    "the goal of this paper is to seek conclusive evidence of dynamical substructure related to merger activity by using the extensive spectroscopy collected at the 6.5 m mmt and 10 m keck ii telescope using the hectospec and deep imaging multi - object spectrograph instruments , respectively .",
    "we describe our target selection and mos observations in section  [ obs ] and our methods for cluster member selection and substructure detection in section  [ anal ] .",
    "we interpret our results in section  [ disc ] and present a summary and concluding remarks in section  [ sum ] . throughout this paper",

    "the spectroscopic target catalogs for both a2142 and rxj1720 were drawn from the sdss and included objects within a projected distance from the cluster center of @xmath14mpc , or @xmath15 and @xmath16 for a2142 and rxj1720 , respectively .",
    "the catalogs were filtered to contain only objects identified as galaxies by the sdss pipeline morphological classification scheme @xcite .",
    "objects near to bright stars and misclassified as galaxies by the automated sdss pipeline were identified by eye and rejected from the catalog .",
    "objects with existing sdss spectroscopy and having redshifts which placed them well outside the redshift range expected for the cluster of interest were also removed from the sample .",
    "we transformed the sdss @xmath17 and @xmath18band magnitudes onto the johnson - cousins @xmath19 and @xmath20 system using equations a5 and a7 of @xcite .",
    "the majority of the spectra used in this paper were collected at the 6.5 m mmt using the hectospec multi - object spectrograph @xcite .",
    "hectospec is a bench - mounted spectrograph which has the capability to simultaneously observe 300 objects through 1.5 diameter fibers spread over a 1 degree field of view .",
    "the observations were performed with the 270 groove mm@xmath21 grating resulting in spectra with @xmath22resolution covering the wavelength range @xmath23 .",
    "approximately 30 fibers were allocated to blank sky regions to facilitate sky subtraction during the data reduction . due to the large number of targets compared to the number of available fibers and fiber packing limitations , 6 and 8 configurations were required to obtain adequate spectroscopic completeness for rxj1720 and a2142 , respectively .",
    "the exposure time , magnitude limit and seeing conditions for each mmt / hectospec configuration are summarized in table  [ mmt_obs ] .",
    "the fiber configurations were generated with the xfitfibs software where the ranking capability was utilized to ensure that the most likely cluster members had a better chance of being allocated to a configuration .",
    "for rxj1720 , objects were ranked based on their position on the color - magnitude relation ( figure  [ redseq ] ) and also their @xmath24  in the sense that objects lying redward of the cluster red - sequence , i.e. , above the bold black line in figure  [ redseq ] , and with @xmath25mpc were ranked lowest while those galaxies which lie on or blueward of the red - sequence and with @xmath26mpc were ranked highest .",
    "the slope of the line delineating those galaxies redward of the red sequence is calculated from the best fit to the red sequence slope versus redshift diagram in figure 3 . of @xcite .",
    "the ranking procedure was similar for the a2142 configurations , except that objects lying redward of the cluster red - sequence were simply not included for observation ( figure  [ redseq ] ) , while a number of objects identified as being part of local projected overdensities ( aside from the central overdensity ) were given higher rankings and a number of fainter ( @xmath27 ) objects were included with low rankings as filler objects to be allocated to spare fibers .",
    "the spectra were reduced at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory telescope data center ( tdc ) using the specroad pipeline @xcite .",
    "redshifts were also determined at the tdc using the iraf cross - correlation xcsao software @xcite and each spectrum was assigned a redshift quality of `` q '' for a reliable redshift , `` ? '' for questionable and `` x '' for a bad redshift measurement .",

    "these maps are produced at three limiting magnitudes of interest : @xmath84 and are shown in figure  [ compl_map ] .",
    "the leftmost map in figure  [ compl_map ] shows the completeness for the magnitude limit of the mmt / hectospec observations and confirms that the spectroscopic completeness is excellent and generally above @xmath70 .",
    "the middle and right panels reveal a more patchy spectroscopic completeness which is high in the central 1mpc and falls off towards the cluster outskirts .",
    "we allocate cluster membership using a two - step procedure . in the first step ,",
    "crude cluster membership is achieved by selecting galaxies within 3mpc of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and with a peculiar velocity of @xmath85@xmath2   with respect to the bcg redshift .",
    "the shifting gapper method used previously in @xcite does not adequately remove the remaining interlopers .",
    "this is because the depth and completeness of the a2142 redshift catalog means gaps in velocity phase space are more likely to be `` filled '' , while the proximity of a nearby structure in velocity space for rxj1720 causes the shifting gapper method to fail ( figure  [ vpec_rad ] ) .",
    "therefore , we employ the parametric technique introduced by @xcite where the maximum possible velocity at the projected radius of each galaxy is calculated given the mass profile of the cluster , which is derived from the virial theorem ( for a detailed discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "determination of the virial mass relies critically on the assumption that the particles tracing the underlying gravitational potential are virialized and that their distribution is spherically symmetric .",
    "the most likely galaxies for which these assumptions apply are elliptical and s0 type galaxies , while spiral galaxies are more likely to be either line of sight interlopers , or an infalling population on radial orbits and , therefore , not virialized @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", we use only galaxies on the red sequence shown in figure  [ redseq ] , which we assume is primarily composed of elliptical and s0 galaxies , to determine the mass profiles used in defining the velocity limits for cluster membership .",
    "furthermore , to reduce any biases in the measurements of the mean projected separations used for the virial mass estimator , we restrict the red sequence galaxies to a magnitude range with high spectroscopic completeness ( i.e. , @xmath86 for rxj1720 and @xmath87 for a2142 ) .",
    "the results of the membership allocation are presented in figure  [ vpec_rad ] where it can be seen that this method of interloper removal does an excellent job . for reference",
    ", we highlight the galaxies lying on the blue cloud using blue stars in figure  [ vpec_rad ] . we define blue cloud galaxies as those lying blueward of the lower limit defining the red sequence in figure  [ redseq ] .",
    "inspection of the distribution of blue cloud galaxies confirms that they have a very different phase - space distribution when compared to the red sequence galaxies , thus justifying our decision not to use them when estimating the virial mass .",
    "we note that our procedure rejects a number of galaxies which lie close to the boundaries defined by the maximum velocity profile but also appear to be well separated from the more clear - cut non - members .",
    "these consist primarily of blue cloud galaxies and , given their large peculiar velocities , are likely to be galaxies on radial orbits on their first passage onto the cluster .",
    "we prefer the more conservative cut here , since these galaxies appear to be distributed evenly in phase space and are thus unlikely to be part of the substructures we seek to detect , while their inclusion in the sample may affect the tests we plan to use for detecting substructure in the later sections .",
    "the final cluster member catalogs contain 956 and 400 members for a2142 and rxj1720 , respectively . from the ensemble of member redshifts we use biweight estimators @xcite to measure cluster redshifts of @xmath88 and @xmath89 and peculiar velocity dispersions",

    "ultimately , our goal in this study is to test the hypothesis that cold fronts in clusters with otherwise regular x - ray morphologies can be caused by the gravitational perturbation of an infalling substructure during a minor merger @xcite . to that end",
    ", we use our samples of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to search for merger - related substructures in the 1d velocity , 2d spatial and 3d velocity - plus - spatial distributions .      a first order test of the dynamical regularity of a cluster comes from the shape of the peculiar velocity distribution which , in a dynamically relaxed cluster , is expected to take an approximately gaussian shape .",
    "gross departures from a gaussian shape , particularly in the form of a skewness or bimodality , often indicate the existence of merger activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we choose to use the gauss - hermite reconstruction method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) to test for departures from a gaussian shape .",
    "briefly , the velocity distribution is described by a series of gauss - hermite functions with the gauss - hermite moments @xmath93 multiplying the zeroth order term , which is the best fitting gaussian with mean @xmath94 and standard deviation @xmath95 , while the @xmath96 and @xmath97 terms approximate asymmetric and symmetric deviations from a gaussian .",
    "radial changes in the velocity distribution profile , e.g. , the decrease in the velocity dispersion with radius observed in many clusters @xcite , can cause significant @xmath97 terms which are not related to merger activity .",

    "furthermore , we wish to determine if the cold fronts observed in the cores of these clusters can be related to merger activity , therefore confirming that cold fronts are excellent signatures of merger activity . the results of our substructure tests reveal that a2142 and rxj1720 harbor a number of group - scale substructures which manifest themselves as enhancements in the local galaxy surface density ( section  [ 2d ] ) , and as regions of localized velocity substructure ( section  [ 3d ] ) .",
    "the existence of these group - scale substructures is consistent with a minor merger origin of the cold fronts , as seen in the simulations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite for a more specific case ) where a low mass group perturbs the main cluster core and induces cold fronts .",
    "the problem now , particularly for a2142 , is to determine which of the many substructures detected is the most likely perturber . as a first step ,",
    "we note that substructures with large @xmath24are unlikely to have made a pericentric passage and , thus , are unlikely to be the perturber .",
    "we outline the evidence for this statement in subsection  [ out ] and discuss the substructures which we consider to be the most likely perturbers in a2142 ( s1 and s2 ; subsection  [ a2142_in ] ) and rxj1720 ( s1 and s3 ; subsection  [ rxj1720_in ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the apocentric distance of a subcluster after its initial pericentric passage .",
    "we obtain an estimate for this distance by considering the simulations of @xcite where the average apocentric distances for an ensemble of simulated clusters with merging subhalos of varying masses is shown in their figure  11 .",
    "we only consider results for the `` self bound '' satellite particles in @xcite , since these results are more likely to reflect our observed substructures .",
    "two important features can be noted here : ( i ) on average , the subhalos do not travel farther than the main cluster s virial radius , @xmath218 , after pericenter and ( ii ) due to dynamical friction , larger mass subhalos have apocentric distances as little as @xmath219 .",
    "thus , it is highly unlikely that any substructure observed at radii larger than the cluster virial radius has passed pericenter ",
    "they are far more likely to be groups which are falling onto the cluster for the first time . for a2142 and rxj1720",
    ", we assume that the virial radius is @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the radius where the density of the cluster is 200 times the critical density at redshift @xmath222 , @xmath223 is the cluster velocity dispersion and @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "this results in @xmath225mpc for a2142 and rxj1720 , respectively , and we set this as an initial constraint on the @xmath24  within which the perturber must lie .",
    "these limits are plotted as cyan circles in figures  [ a2142_all ] and [ rxj1720_all ] . for rxj1720",
    ", these limits do not strongly rule out any of the substructures as potential perturbers , although s3 lies close to the virial radius in projection .",
    "for a2142 , the substructures s3 and s5 are outside of the @xmath218 and are therefore ruled out as potential perturbers , while s4 and s6 lie at approximately the virial radius .",
    "those substructures at the virial radius in a2142 ( s4 , s6 ) are unlikely to be the perturbers because ( i ) projection effects mean that the observed radius gives the minimum distance from the cluster center ",
    "if the substructure lies at some distance in front or behind the cluster , then it is likely to lie outside the virial radius and ( ii ) the limit imposed here is an upper limit on the radius .",
    "more massive systems which have passed close to the cluster core are strongly affected by dynamical friction @xcite and thus have smaller apocentric distances .    further evidence that these substructures at large @xmath24  ( @xmath226 ) are unlikely to have passed",
    "pericenter comes from considering the timescales required to produce the cold front pairs seen in the _ chandra _  images ( figures  [ a2142_all ] and [ rxj1720_all ] ) .",
    "given that the fluid velocities involved are small compared to the kepler speed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sloshing motions that give rise to cold fronts are likely to be reasonably well described as superpositions of internal gravity waves excited by merging subclusters @xcite . locally ,",
    "the oscillation frequency of these waves is the brunt - visl frequency @xmath227[omega_bv ] where @xmath228 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath229 is the radius , @xmath230 is the entropy index and @xmath231 is the keplerian orbital frequency . thus @xmath232 is expected to provide an estimate of sloshing frequencies .",
    "the radial entropy profiles for both a2142 and rxj1720 have been measured by @xcite and they have logarithmic slopes of @xmath233 at the positions of the cold fronts , respectively .",
    "therefore , the approximation @xmath234 is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "this justifies the estimate of @xcite , which employs the radial dependence of the frequency to determine the time required for an adjacent pair of cold fronts to get out of phase by @xmath235 radians , i.e. , to appear on opposite sides of the cluster center . even in the linear approximation",
    ", a more thorough treatment requires determination of the spectrum and phasing of the internal modes excited by a merging subhalo , then following the time development of this superposition of internal gravity waves .",
    "apart from nonlinear effects , this leaves considerable uncertainty in our time estimates .    to determine @xmath236 , we measure the cold front radii from the central brightest cluster galaxy which is assumed to mark the potential minimum and assume a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) density distribution meaning the circular velocity is simply @xmath237 .",
    "we also assume that the time required for the cold front pairs to become @xmath235 radians out of phase in their orbits is equivalent to the time since the perturber s pericentric passage . for a2142",
    ", the inner and outer cold fronts have radii @xmath238kpc and @xmath239kpc , respectively , and @xmath240@xmath2 . the time required for the cold fronts to become out of phase by @xmath235 radians is @xmath241gyr .",
    "the same calculation for rxj1720 with @xmath242kpc , @xmath243kpc and @xmath244@xmath2  gives @xmath245gyr .",
    "@xcite found that the cold front age calculated by @xcite was underestimated by a factor of 3.5 when compared to their simulations .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath246 for several of the cold fronts in figure  7 of @xcite , finding that this method generally underestimates the time since pericentric passage by factors of 3 - 4 , consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we estimate that the `` true '' time since pericentric passage for both a2142 and rxj1720 is @xmath247gyrs . we note that viewing angles and uncertainties in the phasing of the waves mean that these estimates give only a rough guide for the time since pericenter .",
    "furthermore , we note that the cold fronts that we observe in a2142 and rxj1720 occur on much larger scales than the cold fronts seen at similar times in the simulations .",
    "this may reflect differences in the physical properties of a2142 and rxj1720 compared to the simulated clusters , e.g. , the shape of the underlying potential will affect the oscillation frequencies .",
    "the spatial and temporal scales of the fronts are also likely to be affected by properties of the perturber , including its mass and impact parameter .",
    "nevertheless , the timescales derived above provide useful estimates for our purposes and provide strong support for the radial constraints derived from @xcite . for a substructure to have reached the virial radius after pericenter on these timescales",
    ", it would need to have traveled at an average radial velocity since pericenter of @xmath248@xmath2  for a2142 and rxj1720 .",
    "while velocities of this order are expected at pericenter during a merger , they do not persist on gigayear timescales since the subcluster velocity quickly decays after pericenter due to the effects of gravity and dynamical friction as it travels outward .",
    "this places strong constraints on whether substructures s4 and s6 in a2142 have had time to have passed pericenter and traveled to their current @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we disregard them as being potential perturbers .",
    "having ruled out s3 , s4 , s5 and s6 in a2142 , we now consider substructure s7 which we rule out for the following reasons .",
    "first , while it lies within the virial radius , it has a relatively large radius ( @xmath249mpc ) which , as noted above for s4 and s6 , gives its minimum distance from the cluster center",
    ". furthermore , as noted in section  [ struct_summary ] , while there is a local excess in the projected galaxy density , there is little evidence for any corresponding localized velocity substructure .",
    "this means that if there is a real substructure in this region , it is probably not very massive .",
    "a further possibility is that the excess in galaxy surface density is due to projection of galaxies which are not physically associated and therefore that s7 is not a bona fide substructure . given its uncertain nature and large @xmath24 , we find it unlikely that s7 has passed pericenter and , if it has , it is probably not massive enough to have caused the perturbation required to produce the cold fronts with such large radii and contrast . therefore , we also dismiss s7 as a potential perturber .    the radial limits derived above for rxj1720 placed no strong limits on any of the substructures shown in figure  [ rxj1720_all ] .",
    "however , we rule out the substructures s2 and s4 because they are unlikely to be significant substructures , if real associations at all .",
    "starting with s2 , this substructure consists of a grouping of a small number of galaxies with similar velocities and a small dispersion of only @xmath250@xmath2 .",
    "there appears to be a substructure at approximately this location in the lensing maps of @xcite , although it is not concentrated and is only detected at the @xmath251 level .",
    "the presence of substructure detected using our spectroscopically confirmed members and also in the lensing maps of @xcite provide strong support that s2 is a real substructure .",
    "however , the low velocity dispersion and low significance in the lensing maps imply that s2 has low mass and is therefore not likely to have played an important role in perturbing the cluster core .",
    "considering the s4 substructure , while there are hints of localized velocity substructure in this region according to the @xmath126-test and the velocity fields , there is only a weak excess in galaxy surface density here .",
    "furthermore , the kmm analysis failed to identify any bimodality in this region . given the uncertainty in the existence of velocity substructure and the lack of a compact 2d substructure , it is unlikely that s4 is a real substructure .",
    "deeper , more complete spectroscopic coverage of rxj1720 would be required to determine if there is a real substructure there .",
    "we begin our discussion with the s1 substructure surrounding the second bcg at @xmath119kpc to the northwest of the first ranked bcg .",
    "the kmm fit returns @xmath252@xmath2 , although a bimodal fit to the local velocity distribution was not favored statistically over a unimodal one .",
    "however , the surrounding local overdensity in the galaxy surface density , along with the compact local overdensity in the 1500 and 2000@xmath2  tomograms ( figure  [ a2142_tomo ] ) indicate that there is a kinematically compact grouping of @xmath253 galaxies associated with this bcg .",
    "any kinematic distinction is likely diluted by the projection of the main cluster core galaxies onto s1 due to its close proximity in projection to the core .",
    "bcgs are expected to be found at the centers of groups and clusters thus the existence of a second bcg provides strong evidence that s1 is a merger remnant . given the relatively high ( although not extreme ) positive peculiar velocity of s1 , we speculate that the majority of its motion is aligned with our line of sight . in the scenario where s1 is the perturber responsible for the cold fronts ,",
    "it must have already passed pericenter .",
    "if the estimated time since pericenter of @xmath4gyr derived above is correct , then s1 is unlikely to have passed apocenter and therefore we surmise that it is currently located on the far side of the cluster on its way to apocenter .",
    "further evidence for a perturber which has an orbit which is highly inclined to the plane of the sky , such as that proposed for s1 , comes from the morphology of the cold fronts .",
    "the _ chandra _  data for a2142 reveal two prominent cold fronts @xcite straddling the cool core ( figure  [ a2142_all ] ) .",
    "there is no clear spiral structure seen in the residual map ( right panel of figure  [ a2142_all ] ) , nor in the temperature maps available in the literature @xcite , although there are fairly linear structures joining the innermost cold front to the outermost one .",
    "the morphology of the cold fronts is consistent with a spiral structure viewed with its axis almost perpendicular to our line of sight , e.g. , as shown in the middle panel of figure  19 in @xcite . in the simulations ,",
    "the spiral structure is formed when angular momentum is transfered to the displaced core gas from a perturber which has undergone an offcenter passage @xcite . because the angular momentum responsible for the spiral structure originates with the offcenter passage of the perturber , the spiral and perturber orbit must be coplanar . based on this and the evidence that we are viewing a spiral structure with its axis almost perpendicular to our line of sight",
    ", we surmise that the perturber is orbiting in a plane which is highly inclined to the plane of the sky .",
    "we also note here that the central bcg has a peculiar velocity of @xmath254@xmath2  with respect to the cluster velocity distribution .",
    "this difference is significant at the @xmath255 level according to the method outlined in @xcite . assuming that the bcg lies at the bottom of the cluster potential as traced by the dark matter",
    ", we interpret this as evidence of dark matter core oscillations .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite the observation of bcg peculiar velocities is naturally encompassed in their gasless minor merger scenario . in that scenario ,",
    "a purely gravitational perturbation excites oscillations in both the dark matter and gas cores leading to cold fronts when the gas decouples from the dark matter .",
    "however , in the case where a weak shock or other purely hydrodynamical disturbance @xcite perturbs the core and generates the cold fronts , only the gas is expected to oscillate , thus no significant bcg peculiar velocity should be observed .",
    "we interpret the bcg peculiar velocity as evidence that the cold fronts are generated by the gravitational disturbance of a minor merger .",
    "furthermore , the detection of a line of sight velocity offset lends support to our assertion that the perturber s orbit is inclined to the line of sight .    as an alternative , we consider the s2 substructure , which is a fairly loose group of galaxies at a projected distance of @xmath256kpc from the central bcg , has a mean peculiar velocity of @xmath257@xmath2  and dispersion @xmath258@xmath2 . supporting evidence for s2 being a real substructure comes from the lensing analysis of @xcite who detect a signal in their projected mass map which is significant at the @xmath251 level and is approximately at the position of s2 .",
    "similar to s1 , the positive peculiar velocity of s2 implies that it is currently travelling away from us and , assuming that it has not passed apocenter , that its initial trajectory began in the foreground to the southeast of the main cluster core .",
    "it passed pericenter on the se before being deflected behind the cluster core and to the northwest where it traveled to its current position .",
    "the most viable perturber candidate for rxj1720 is the s1 substructure lying @xmath124kpc north of the cluster core .",
    "this substructure is conspicuous as an excess in the galaxy surface density maps and shows evidence for localized kinematic substructure . a more detailed inspection of the velocity distribution surrounding s1 in section  [ kmm ] revealed significant bimodality with two substructures separated by @xmath259@xmath2 , neither of which is centered at the systemic cluster velocity ( @xmath260@xmath2  and @xmath261@xmath2 ) .",
    "while the velocity structure is complicated here and is hard to interpret , we are confident that there exists a massive substructure here , particularly given that @xcite find significant substructure in their lensing maps which is spatially coincident with s1 .    here",
    ", we consider a scenario where s1 has perturbed the core during its pericenter passage and is currently moving outwards towards the north . considering the _ chandra _  residual map generated from the _ chandra _   data in the right panel of figure  [ rxj1720_all ] , a clear spiral structure can be seen which is also seen in the temperature maps of @xcite and @xcite . following on from the discussion on the spiral morphology in section  [ a2142_in ] ,",
    "this means we must be observing the spiral structure which has an axis that is aligned roughly with our line of sight .",
    "we also note that , in contrast to a2142 , we see no significant peculiar velocity offset in the bcg , consistent with the sloshing occurring mainly in a plane perpendicular to our line of sight . by extension ,",
    "the axis of the perturber s orbit is roughly coincident with our line of sight .",
    "furthermore , following the spiral from the outermost cold front to the core , the winding direction is clockwise .",
    "@xcite noted that the orbit of the perturber and that of the gas generating the spiral pattern should exhibit prograde rotation , as seen in the simulations @xcite .",
    "this implies that the s1 substructure follows a clockwise orbit from our perspective .",
    "we propose that s1 has traveled from the south , passed the core region on the eastern side providing the necessary perturbation for the generation of the cold fronts and is now headed to the north .",
    "one issue with this interpretation is the proximity of s1 to the cluster core .",
    "if the time since pericenter of @xmath137gyr derived above is correct and the perturber s orbital plane is very close to the plane of the sky , then s1 should have had time to travel much further than @xmath262kpc .",
    "of course , this assertion relies critically on the velocity of s1 which is not well constrained .",
    "however , even assuming a relatively small radial velocity of 1000@xmath2  since core passage implies that s1 should be @xmath263mpc from the cluster core .",
    "this issue is somewhat relieved if we take the lower value of @xmath264 derived above and assume that s1 s orbit has some component parallel with our line of sight .    alternatively ,",
    "if we have underestimated the time since pericenter , then it is possible that s1 has passed apocenter and is currently headed towards its second pericenter .",
    "this also relieves the tension between the observed scales of the cold fronts in rxj1720 , which occur at much larger radii when compared with those formed on @xmath4gyr post - pericenter timescales seen in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "for example , in the 3.8 gyr panel of figure  7 in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath120 gyr after pericenter and just prior to the second pericenter , the most prominent cold fronts have radii @xmath265kpc and @xmath266kpc , similar to the cold fronts observed in rxj1720 .",
    "however , @xcite note that the contrast in density and temperature at the cold fronts decreases with time by a factor of 1.5 at 3.8 gyrs , compared with the factor of @xmath78 jump observed in rxj1720 @xcite .",
    "this difference in contrast may reflect a difference in the mass , the gas content and/or the impact parameter of the perturber between rxj1720 and the simulations presented in figure  7 of @xcite .",
    "the s3 substructure located at @xmath121mpc south of the cluster core may also be considered a potential perturber .",
    "the kmm fits revealed that the velocity of this substructure is @xmath267@xmath2  and it has dispersion @xmath268@xmath2 .",
    "this dispersion is fairly large and comparable to that expected of a reasonably large group or poor cluster .",
    "however , visual inspection of the velocity distribution ( lower left panel in figure  [ rxj1720_kmm ] ) reveals that the @xmath269@xmath2  partition has two peaks and thus that this partition may be contaminated by galaxies which are not associated with the substructure",
    ". this contamination may be responsible for inflating the velocity dispersion .",
    "more data are needed to disentangle any contamination and to confirm this velocity dispersion . in any case",
    ", there is clearly a dynamical substructure in this region . in the scenario where s3 is the perturber",
    ", we propose that it has traveled from the north and is currently heading to the south .",
    "based on the arguments above on the winding direction of the spiral structure seen in the right panel of figure  [ rxj1720_all ] , we suggest that s3 passed the cluster core on the western side and is currently heading towards apocenter for the first time .",
    "we have presented comprehensive mmt / hectospec and keck / deimos multi - object spectroscopy of the cold front clusters a2142 and rxj1720 .",
    "these clusters were selected from the `` relaxed appearing '' subsample of cold front clusters from @xcite with the specific aim of testing the hypothesis that minor mergers cause the observed cold fronts . to do this",
    ", we used the spatial and kinematic information contained in samples of 956 and 400 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members for a2142 and rxj1720 , respectively , to search for substructure . in both of the clusters we find group - sized substructure and we identify likely perturbers based on comparisons between the observed cold front morphologies and those seen in the simulations .",
    "our results are consistent with the cold fronts being caused by sloshing induced by the gravitational perturbation caused by a minor merger .",
    "we stress , however , that more detailed merger histories and better orbital constraints will likely require cluster - specific simulations aimed at reproducing both the x - ray morphology and the positions and kinematic properties of the detected substructures .",
    "nonetheless , we conclude that our original stated goal of showing cold fronts are related to merger activity @xcite has been met .",

    "<S> we present evidence for the existence of substructure in the `` relaxed appearing '' cold front clusters abell  2142 and rxj1720.1 + 2638 . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of these substructures was made possible by comprehensive multi - object optical spectroscopy obtained with the hectospec and deep imaging multi - object spectrograph instruments on the 6.5 m mmt and 10 m keck  ii telescope , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these observations produced 956 and 400 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members within a projected radius of 3mpc from the centers of abell  2142 and rxj1720.1 + 2638 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the substructure manifests itself as local peaks in the spatial distribution of member galaxies and also as regions of localized velocity substructure . for both abell  2142 and rxj1720.1 + 2638 , we identify group - scale substructures which , when considering the morphology of the cold fronts and the time since pericentric passage of a perturber estimated from the cold front radii , could plausibly have perturbed the cluster cores and generated the cold fronts observed in _ </S>",

    "<S> the results presented here are consistent with cold fronts being the result of merger activity and with cold fronts in relaxed appearing clusters being due to minor merger activity . </S>"
