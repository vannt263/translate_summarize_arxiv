    "overwhelming observational evidence ( cf .",
    "references in @xcite ) suggests that large - scale mixing processes took place in sn  1987a and transported newly synthesized @xmath2 from its creation site near the collapsed core all the way out to the hydrogen envelope .",
    "spectroscopic studies of sn 1987f , sn 1988a , sn 1993j ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and sn 1995v @xcite indicate that such mixing is probably generic in core collapse supernovae .",
    "indeed , artificial mixing of the radioactive ejecta within the ( helium ) envelope is indispensable in order to reproduce the light curves and spectra of type ib explosions using one - dimensional ( 1d ) hydrodynamic models ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these findings have instigated theoretical work on multidimensional supernova models focusing either on the role of convective instabilities in the delayed , neutrino - driven explosion mechanism within about the first second of evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or on the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilitites during the late evolutionary stages ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , multidimensional simulations which follow the evolution of the supernova shock from its revival due to neutrino heating , until its emergence from the stellar surface have not yet been performed .    in this _ letter _ , we report on preliminary results of high - resolution two - dimensional ( 2d ) computations which for the first time cover the neutrino - driven initiation of the explosion , the accompanying convection and nucleosynthesis as well as the rayleigh - taylor mixing within the first @xmath3 seconds of evolution .",
    "we split our simulation into two stages . the early evolution ( @xmath4s )",
    "is followed with a version of the herakles code ( t. plewa & e. mller , in preparation ) which solves the multidimensional hydrodynamic equations using the direct eulerian version of the piecewise parabolic method @xcite augmented by the consistent multifluid advection scheme of @xcite in order to guarantee exact conservation of nuclear species .",
    "we have added the input physics described in @xcite ( henceforth jm96 ) with the following modifications .",
    "general relativistic corrections are made to the gravitational potential following @xcite .",
    "a 14-isotope network is incorporated in order to compute the explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "it includes the 13 @xmath5-nuclei from @xmath6 to @xmath2 and a representative tracer nucleus which is used to monitor the distribution of the neutrino - heated , neutron - rich material and to replace the @xmath2 production when @xmath7 drops below @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "our initial data are taken from the 15@xmath0 progenitor model of @xcite which was collapsed by @xcite .",
    "the model is mapped to a 2d grid consisting of 400 radial zones ( @xmath9 cm ) , and 180 angular zones ( @xmath10 ; cf .",
    "jm96 for details ) .",
    "a random initial seed perturbation is added to the velocity field with a modulus of @xmath11 of the ( radial ) velocity of the post - collapse model .",
    "the computations begin 20ms after core bounce and are continued until 885ms when the explosion energy has saturated at @xmath12erg ( this value has still to be corrected for the binding energy of the outer envelope )",
    ". we will henceforth refer to this calculation as our `` explosion model '' .",
    "the subsequent shock propagation through the stellar envelope and the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilities is followed with the amra adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ( t. plewa & e. mller , in preparation ) .",
    "neutrino physics and gravity are not included in the amr calculations .",
    "both do not influence the propagation of the shock during late evolutionary stages .",
    "however , gravity is important for determining the amount of fallback , a problem which is outside the scope of the present study .",
    "the equation of state takes into account contributions from photons , non - degenerate electrons , @xmath13-pairs , @xmath14 , and the nuclei included in the reaction network .",
    "the amr calculations are started with the inner and outer boundaries located at @xmath15 cm ( i.e. inside the hot bubble containing the neutrino - driven wind ) and @xmath16 cm , respectively .",
    "no further seed perturbations are added .",
    "our maximum resolution is equivalent to that of a uniform grid of @xmath17 zones .",
    "we do not include the entire star but expand the radial extent of the grid by a factor of 2 to 4 whenever the supernova shock is approaching the outer grid boundary , which is moved from its initial value out to @xmath18 cm at @xmath19s . reflecting",
    "boundary conditions are used at @xmath20 and @xmath21 and free outflow is allowed across the inner and outer radial boundaries .",
    "the general features of our explosion model are comparable to the models of jm96 .",
    "the most important difference is caused by our use of general relativistic corrections to the gravitational potential . since the shock has to overcome a deeper potential well than in the newtonian case , the luminosities ( which are prescribed at the inner boundary ) required to obtain a certain final explosion energy",
    "are roughly 20% higher than those of jm96 .",
    "in particular , we have adopted the following set of parameters : @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "the neutrino spectra and the temporal decay of the luminosity are the same as in jm96 .    for the chosen neutrino luminosities the shock starts to move out of the iron core almost immediately .",
    "convection between shock and gain radius sets in @xmath23ms after the start of the simulation in form of rising blobs of heated , deleptonized material ( with @xmath24 ) separated by narrow downflows with @xmath25 .",
    "the shock reaches the fe / si interface at @xmath26 cm after @xmath27ms . at this time",
    "the shocked material is still in nuclear statistical equilibrium and is composed mainly of @xmath5-particles and nucleons .",
    "when the temperature right behind the shock drops below @xmath28k , @xmath2 starts to form in a narrow shell . during the ongoing expansion and cooling , nickel is also synthesized in the convective region",
    "however , this synthesis proceeds exclusively in the narrow downflows which separate the rising bubbles and have a sufficiently high electron fraction @xmath7 .",
    "the convective anisotropies therefore lead to a highly inhomogeneous nickel distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hotb ] ) .",
    "freezeout of complete silicon burning occurs at @xmath29ms , and convection ceases at @xmath30ms , at which time the flow pattern becomes frozen in .",
    "subsequently , the entire post - shock region expands nearly uniformly .",
    "the post - shock temperature drops below @xmath31k at @xmath32ms , when the shock is about to cross the si / o interface .",
    "thus , our model shows only moderate oxygen burning ( due to a non - vanishing oxygen abundance in the silicon shell ) , and negligible neon and carbon burning .",
    "this is caused by the specific structure of the progenitor model of @xcite and may change when different ( e.g.  more massive ) progenitors are used . in total ,",
    "@xmath33 of @xmath2 are produced , while @xmath34 of material are synthesized at conditions with @xmath35 and end up as neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "[ fig : hotb ] shows the @xmath2 distribution at @xmath36ms . the density ratio between the dense regions which contain the nickel and the low - density , deleptonized material in the bubbles deeper inside is @xmath37 .",
    "during the next seconds the shock detaches from the formerly convective shell that carries the products of explosive nucleosynthesis and crosses the c+o / he - interface , initially accelerating and subsequently decelerating due to the varying density gradient .",
    "twenty seconds after core bounce this unsteady propagation speed of the shock has led to a strong compression of the metal - containing shell . at the inner boundary of the shell pressure waves",
    "have steepened into a reverse shock .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities start to grow at the ni+si / o- and c+o / he - interfaces and are fully developed and interact with each other at @xmath38s .",
    "nickel and silicon are dragged upward into the helium shell in rising mushrooms on angular scales from @xmath39 to about @xmath40 , whereas helium is mixed inward in bubbles .",
    "oxygen and carbon , located in intermediate layers of the progenitor , are swept outward as well as inward in rising and sinking flows . at @xmath41s",
    "the densities and radial velocities between the dense mushrooms and clumps and the ambient medium differ by factors up to 5 and 1.3 , respectively . as fig .",
    "[ fig : amra ] shows , the fastest mushrooms have already propagated out to more than half the radius of the he core .",
    "the excessive outflows along the symmetry axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : amra ] are a numerical artifact caused by the singularity of the polar axis in spherical coordinates . in order not to introduce large errors , only an angular wedge with @xmath42",
    "was used in all the analyses .",
    "the remarkable efficiency of the mixing is clearly visible from fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] where the original onion - shell structure of the progenitor s metal core has disappeared after 300s .",
    "we observe large composition gradients between different regions of a mushroom and also between different mushrooms .",
    "some of them contain @xmath2 mass fractions of more than 70% whereas others have only nickel admixtures of 20% or less but show high concentrations of silicon and oxygen .",
    "composition contrasts of at least this magnitude have recently been observed in different filaments of the cas  a supernova remnant by @xcite .",
    "we find that also more than @xmath43 of matter consisting of neutron - rich nuclei are mixed into the @xmath2 and @xmath44 clumps .",
    "the reverse shock substantially decelerates the bulk of the nickel from @xmath45km / s at @xmath46ms to 3200  4500km / s at @xmath38s , at which time the maximum velocities @xmath47 have dropped to 5800km / s . after another 50s ,",
    "however , the clumps start to move essentially ballistically through the helium core and only a slight drop of @xmath47 from @xmath48  km / s at @xmath49s to @xmath50km / s at @xmath19s occurs , when most of the @xmath2 has velocities below @xmath51km / s ( fig.[fig : nickelv ] ) .",
    "we have recently accomplished to follow the subsequent evolution of our model up to 16000s after core bounce .",
    "similar to the situation at the c+o / he interface , the supernova shock leaves behind a dense ( rayleigh - taylor unstable ) shell at the he / h interface . while the entire shell is rapidly slowed down , a second reverse shock forms at its inner boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : amra ] ) .",
    "our high - resolution simulations reveal a potentially severe problem for the mixing of heavy elements into the hydrogen envelope of type ii supernovae like sn  1987a .",
    "we find that the fast nickel containing clumps , after having penetrated through this reverse shock , dissipate a large fraction of their kinetic energy in bow shocks created by their supersonic motion through the shell medium .",
    "this leads to their deceleration to @xmath52  km / s in our calculations , a negative effect on the clump propagation which has not been discussed previously .",
    "a detailed analysis of this result will be subject of a forthcoming publication .",
    "our calculations provide a _ natural _ explanation for the mixing of @xmath2 into the helium layer , which is required to reproduce the light curves of type ib supernovae @xcite . in this sense",
    "they justify the rather large seed perturbations ( @xmath53 ) which were imposed by @xcite on the radial velocity given from spherically symmetric models of exploding helium cores at about 10@xmath54s after shock formation .",
    "in addition , they may have interesting implications for the modeling of type ib spectra ( woosley , private communication ; compare fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] of this work with fig .  7 in @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations suggest that ballistically moving , metal - rich clumps with velocities up to more than @xmath55km / s are ejected during the explosion of type ib ( and ic ) supernovae . in case of type ii supernovae",
    ", however , the dense shell left behind by the shock passing the boundary between helium core and hydrogen envelope , causes a substantial deceleration of the clumps .",
    "the high iron velocities observed in sn  1987a , for example , can therefore not be accounted for by our models .",
    "this problem would be reduced if the density profile at the he / h interface were smoother , leading to less strong variations of the shock velocity .",
    "could this direct to a possible common envelope phase or merger history of the progenitor star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ? alternatively , the high iron velocities in sn  1987a could require additional energy input from ni decay @xcite or could imply a large global anisotropy of the explosion , e.g. associated with jets emerging from the collapse of a rapidly rotating stellar core @xcite . though final conclusions require three - dimensional calculations , our simulations indicate that all computations of rayleigh - taylor mixing in type  ii supernovae carried out so far ( including the case of sn  1987a ; @xcite ) have been started from overly simplified initial conditions since they have neglected clump formation within the first minutes of the explosion .",
    "the mixing of nucleosynthesis products as seen in our models poses another potential problem .",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath43 of a total of @xmath56 ) of the neutron - rich nuclei which are synthesized in regions with @xmath57 is dragged outward by the nickel containing mushrooms and clumps .",
    "at least this amount will most likely be ejected in the explosion .",
    "a detailed analysis of the nuclear composition is necessary to tell whether this is in conflict with limits from galactic chemical evolution models , which allow for at most @xmath11@xmath58 of neutron - rich nuclei to be ejected per supernova event ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "later fallback will not solve this potential problem : how could it disentangle the clumpy nickel ejecta from their undesirable pollution ?",
    "a better knowledge of the luminosities and spectra of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted from the nascent neutron star is therefore needed to perform more reliable calculations of the neutronization of the neutrino - heated ejecta .    during the computations we became aware of oscillations with angle in parts of the postshock flow ( figs .",
    "[ fig : hotb ] and [ fig : amra ] ) .",
    "these are caused by the `` odd - even decoupling '' phenomenon associated with grid - aligned shocks @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum nickel velocities , @xmath47 , obtained in our amr calculations have probably been overestimated by @xmath59 because the growth of some of the mushrooms was influenced by the perturbations induced by this numerical defect .",
    "the main results of our study , however , are not affected .",
    "we note that a large number of supernova calculations performed with codes based either on the direct eulerian ( cf . figs .  22 and 24 in @xcite , fig .  20 in jm96 ) , or the lagrangean with remap formulation of the ppm scheme @xcite seem to be affected by this numerical flaw .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of this problem to a forthcoming publication .",
    "we thank s. woosley for profiles of the progenitor star and s. bruenn for his post - bounce core model .",
    "we acknowledge support by p. ciecielag and r. walder concerning visualization and by the crew of the rechenzentrum garching where the simulations were performed on the nec sx-4b and cray j916 computers .",
