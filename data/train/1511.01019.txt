    "in its most familiar form , the banach - tarski paradox @xcite asserts that it is possible to decompose a sphere into finitely many disjoint subsets that may be reassembled via translations and rotations into two spheres congruent to the original one , with no overlap or missing points .",
    "it is also known ( see @xcite ) that such a sleight of hand is not possible for point sets within the real number line , at least not if we restrict ourselves to finitely many subsets acted upon by isometries .",
    "wagon @xcite points out that if one enlarges the group of available actions to include all bijections preserving lebesgue measure , then it does become possible to obtain a paradoxical decomposition of an interval , for instance .",
    "however , the means for exhibiting such a decomposition is not altogether satisfactory , in that it relies upon a black box ; namely , a measure - preserving bijection from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , coupled with the banach - tarski result .",
    "the purpose of this note is to present an explicit example of such a paradoxical decomposition of the real number line , using a minimum of external machinery .",
    "since actions by isometries alone are insufficient to produce a paradox , we employ functions that are `` piecewise rigid . ''",
    "a function @xmath5 is _ piecewise rigid _ if    1 .",
    "@xmath6 is a bijection , 2 .",
    "@xmath6 is differentiable with @xmath7 , except at a countable number of jump discontinuities , and 3 .",
    "the set of discontinuities of @xmath6 has no limit points in @xmath2 .",
    "clearly piecewise rigid functions preserve lebesgue measure .",
    "we mention without proof that the set of all piecewise rigid function on @xmath2 form a group with respect to composition .",
    "we can now describe our goal more precisely : we will partition the real number line into four subsets in such a way that it is possible to `` reassemble '' the subsets using piecewise rigid functions to produce two copies of the line .",
    "a key ingredient in the construction of the paradoxical subsets consists of a pair of functions that generate a free group .",
    "therefore our primary task is to produce such functions .",
    "we do so by observing that given any permutation of the integers , we may extend it to a piecewise rigid bijection of the real numbers .    given a permutation @xmath8 , we define @xmath9 by setting @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the greatest integer function and @xmath12 is the fractional part of @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 .     corresponding to @xmath15 . ]    if we label @xmath16 as `` interval @xmath17 '' for @xmath18 , then the function @xmath19 has the effect of permuting these half - open intervals as prescribed by @xmath20 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ graph ] illustrates the graph of the function corresponding to the permutation @xmath15 , where we assume that @xmath20 fixes all other integers .",
    "it is clear that composing such functions commutes with composition of the underlying permutations ; in other words , if @xmath21 are permutations , then @xmath22 . in particular , @xmath23 is the identity , so @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the group generated by @xmath19 and @xmath25 will be free as long as no composition involving @xmath26 that is reduced ( meaning no permutation is adjacent to its inverse ) is equal to the identity .",
    "beyond merely generating a free group , we seek a pair of functions for which the elements of the resulting free group have few fixed points . in the standard banach - tarski construction",
    "the nontrivial free group elements are all rotations , each having two fixed points at the poles where the axis of rotation meets the surface of the sphere .",
    "these points are a nuisance  they must be handled separately and increase the number of pieces required for the construction beyond the basic four . in light of this , we are interested in finding @xmath20 and @xmath27 for which no composition involving @xmath28 even has a fixed point , a much stronger condition than the one required to obtain a free group .",
    "momentarily we will exhibit such a pair of permutations @xmath20 and @xmath27 .",
    "observe that neither permutation can have a cycle of finite length , for if @xmath20 had a cycle of length @xmath17 , for example , then @xmath29 would have @xmath17 fixed points .",
    "neither can @xmath20 consist of a single infinite cycle ; for if @xmath30 then some power of @xmath20 or @xmath31 will map @xmath32 to 0 , meaning that @xmath33 has a fixed point for some @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , further consideration shows that if either @xmath20 or @xmath27 consists of only finitely many infinite cycles then a fixed point is again inevitable .",
    "so @xmath20 and @xmath27 must be constructed with some care .     and @xmath27 .",
    "]    there exist permutations @xmath21 that generate a free subgroup within the group of all permutations of @xmath34 , with the property that no element of this free group , other than the identity , has any fixed points .",
    "we will construct such permutations using the cayley graph for a free group on two generators . recall that this graph contains countably many vertices ,",
    "each with degree four , typically displayed with horizontal and vertical edges , as in fig .",
    "we have labeled the vertices with all the integers ; any particular bijection between @xmath34 and the vertex set will suffice for the construction . for each horizontal edge",
    "having vertices labeled @xmath35 and @xmath17 from left to right , we now declare @xmath36 . from a dynamic point of view , @xmath20 maps each integer to the one appearing immediately to its right in the cayley graph , while @xmath31 maps each integer to the one directly to the left .",
    "similarly , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined as the integers just above and below @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath39 and @xmath40 , for instance .",
    "therefore the permutation given by a reduced word on @xmath20 and @xmath27 will map each integer to an image that may be reached via a certain fixed sequence of steps through the cayley graph , each step being left , right , up or down . since the word is reduced the path will never double back on itself , and since the cayley graph is a tree the image can not be equal to the original integer . in other words , no composition of @xmath20 and @xmath27 can have any fixed points , since mapping an integer to itself corresponds to a cycle through the tree , which is impossible .",
    "in fact we have shown slightly more ; namely , given any distinct @xmath41 there exists a unique reduced composition of @xmath20 and @xmath27 mapping @xmath35 to @xmath17 . for instance , to map @xmath42 to 6 we simply trace a path through the tree from @xmath42 down to 5 , right to @xmath43 , then up to 6 , revealing that @xmath44 .",
    "we are now in possession of a pair of functions @xmath45 that are piecewise rigid , generate a free group , and have the property that no reduced composition of these functions has any fixed points . in",
    "what follows we will write @xmath46 and @xmath47 to simplify notation .",
    "the remainder of the argument is standard , although considerably simpler than the original proof involving spheres , since there are no `` bad points '' to handle separately , nor is the axiom of choice required .",
    "we follow the approach described in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to partition the real number line @xmath2 into four subsets @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 are piecewise rigid functions and @xmath52 denotes disjoint union .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the functions constructed above , and let @xmath53 be the free group generated by @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ". then an element of @xmath53 has the form @xmath56 where we require exponents to be nonzero except for possibly @xmath57 or @xmath58 , to allow for compositions that begin with a power of @xmath55 or end with a power of @xmath54 .",
    "we next partition the elements of @xmath53 into four subsets .",
    "to begin , let @xmath59 consist of all elements beginning with a positive power of @xmath54 and @xmath60 contain all elements beginning with a negative power of @xmath54 .",
    "one can then verify that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the set @xmath63 .",
    "it would be convenient to create similar sets according to the initial power of @xmath55 , but then the identity would not appear in any subset .",
    "so we instead let @xmath64 consist of all elements beginning with a positive power of @xmath55 followed by at least one more term , and define @xmath65 as the set containing any element beginning with a negative power of @xmath55 , along with the identity and elements of the form @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "we then have @xmath68 by construction .",
    "now label @xmath69 and set @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and similarly for the other sets .",
    "the fact that there exists a unique permutation generated by @xmath20 and @xmath27 mapping 0 to any particular integer ensures that the intervals @xmath73 for @xmath74 are distinct and together comprise all of @xmath2 . because the sets @xmath59 through @xmath65 partition @xmath53",
    ", we conclude that @xmath75 as well . finally , the fact that @xmath76 translates to @xmath77 , and we similarly find that @xmath78 , as desired .",
    "a paradoxical decomposition of a set typically has a consequence regarding what sorts of measures are possible on that set . in our case",
    "we have the following .",
    "there is no finitely additive measure @xmath79 on the real number line with @xmath80 that is also invariant under piecewise rigid maps .",
    "suppose such a measure @xmath79 existed , say with @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 but we also know that @xmath83 which implies that @xmath84 , a contradiction .",
    "hence no such measure exists .",
    "this result is of interest given the existence of a finitely additive measure on the lebesgue subsets of the real number line that is invariant with respect to isometries and for which @xmath85 , as constructed in @xcite .",
    "it does not take a great leap of imagination to realize that a similar construction may be effected that will permit us to split the real number line into a disjoint union of @xmath0 sets for any @xmath86 , then reassemble them via piecewise rigid functions into @xmath1 copies of the line .",
    "one simply employs the cayley graph for a free group on @xmath1 generators , labels the vertices with all the integers as before , defines permutations @xmath87 through @xmath88 which map integers in each of the @xmath1 `` positive directions '' within the graph , and subsequently defines functions @xmath89 through @xmath90 based on these permutations .",
    "there is a paradoxical decomposition of the free group @xmath53 on @xmath1 generators into @xmath1 pairs of subsets analogous to before , in which @xmath91 of the pairs consist of words beginning with a positive or negative power of some @xmath92 , say for @xmath93 , while the last pair involving @xmath89 utilizes the small variation that allows us to include the identity of @xmath53 among the subsets .",
    "the various subsets of @xmath2 are then given by the images of @xmath94 as before , and we obtain the paradoxical decomposition in the same manner .    in fact , there is nothing to prevent one from carrying out the same construction beginning with the cayley graph for a free group on countably many generators , since the vertex set of this graph is still countably infinite and thus may be labeled with all the integers .",
    "the remainder of the process goes through with hardly any modification . in summary , we have the following result .",
    "let @xmath95 be a positive integer .",
    "then it is possible to partition the real number line @xmath2 into @xmath0 subsets @xmath96 such that @xmath97 for piecewise rigid functions @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , one can partition @xmath2 into countably many subsets @xmath99 such that @xmath100 where all @xmath92 are piecewise rigid functions .",
    "we remark in closing that our approach relies upon the fact that the real number line is unbounded ; an analogous sort of construction could not be performed to obtain a paradoxical decomposition of an interval , for instance , at least not using piecewise rigid functions .",
    "the authors are grateful to japheth wood for a conversation that led to a considerably more streamlined construction of @xmath20 and @xmath27 than was originally envisioned .",
    "thanks also to paul zeitz for sharing his carefully crafted course notes as well as to stan wagon for observing that our decomposition leads to implications regarding measures on the real number line .",
