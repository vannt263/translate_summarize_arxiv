    "in many contexts in physics , it is important to know the existence ( or absence ) of correlations @xcite of a system of interest @xmath0 and its environment @xmath1 ( another unknown system ) .",
    "for example , in order to achieve a successful quantum information processing , quantum communication or quantum mechanical control , one has to manage system - environment correlations which may enhance the decoherence of the states of the system .",
    "however , in many cases , we know neither the structure of the environment nor the nature of the interaction of the system . under these circumstances , one has to detect possible correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , only from the measurements of the system @xmath0 , not from those of the total system @xmath2 . to do this ,",
    "if an ensemble of independently identical systems is available , the following well - known criterion @xcite for quantum systems can be applied :    * ( a ) if the system @xmath0 is in a pure state , then @xmath0 has no correlations with any other environment @xmath1 . *    from this statement , an experimentalist can safely conclude no correlations with any environment if he / she found his / her ( reduced ) state in a pure state .",
    "indeed , some of the unconditional security proofs of quantum cryptography partially rely on this fact @xcite , where an unknown eavesdropper is assumed to prepare any environment and do anything which is physically allowed .    unfortunately , statement ( a ) is unavailable when the reduced state is in a mixed state",
    ". indeed , then , any static property of a subsystem can not provide the information of the correlation , since the same reduced mixed states can be generated from the total states with and without the system - environment correlations @xcite .",
    "therefore , in such cases , we would need to use dynamical information as well . here",
    "what we would like to discuss and try to show is the following statement :    * ( b ) if the time derivative of the purity of @xmath0 is not zero at time @xmath3 , there exist non - zero correlations with a certain environment at that",
    "time*.    if this statement is universally true , this makes an experimentalist possible to confirm non - zero correlations with some environment if he / she found the time derivative of the purity is not zero @xcite .",

    "indeed , experimentalists usually confirm the existence of an interaction between the system and some environment , if they find the reduced purity not to be constant .",

    "@xcite where we have shown that an effect of an initial correlation does not appear in van hove s limit ( the weak coupling limit ) and therefore system @xmath0 behaves as if the total system started from the factorized initial state .",
    "indeed , this is true only for the van hove time scale @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a coupling constant , and in much shorter time scales than @xmath71 , we can find a difference between no correlations and non - zero correlations as we have seen in the above theorems .",
    "( see also @xcite for an effect of an initial correlation . )",
    "in the previous section , we have confirmed that statement ( b ) is universally true for any bounded hamiltonian .",
    "however , hamiltonians are generally unbounded , especially from above , like that of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "notice that , although the quantitative estimation in theorem [ thm : strong ] turns out to be trivial when @xmath72 , we may still expect the validity of theorem [ thm : weak ] , i.e. , statement ( b ) . in this section ,",
    "we discuss statement ( b ) in the case of unbounded hamiltonians .",

    "we provide a counter example of statement ( b ) .",

    "the time evolution map @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",

    "( b ) @xmath100 , with a unit of time @xmath101 . notice that in both cases the hamiltonians are unbounded from above .",
    "one sees the flat time derivative at @xmath26 in ( a ) which makes statement ( b ) to be true , while one sees non - differentiability in ( b ) which breaks down statement ( b ) .",

    "we provide an interesting example that @xmath47 is continuous but not differentiable at anytime @xmath22 by connecting the reduced purity to the so - called weierstrass function @xmath111 @xcite , defined by @xmath112 with two parameters @xmath113 and positive odd integer @xmath114 satisfying @xmath115 .",

    "this provides a counter example of statement ( b ) .",
    "namely , even with a product initial state , a time derivative of the purity is not necessarily zero ; though this case just provides a case of a non - existence of the time - derivative .    therefore ,",
    "in the case of unbounded hamiltonians , we need to modify our statement ( b ) .",
    "indeed , the following weaker statement can be proved to be true :    [ thm : weaker ] let @xmath18 be a self - adjoint hamiltonian bounded from below , but not necessarily bounded from above .",
    "let @xmath10 be a density operator at @xmath3 .",
    "* if the variance of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath10 is finite * , then @xmath120    the assumption of the boundedness of the hamiltonian from below is physically required so that the system to be stable .",
    "hence , even when the hamiltonian @xmath18 is unbounded , statement ( b ) is correct provided that the total state has a finite variance of @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the variance of @xmath18 is infinite for the initial state used for the counter example in .",
    "to avoid redundant technical difficulties when dealing with unbounded hamiltonians , in the present paper , we do not give a proof of theorem [ thm : weaker ] .",
    "instead , we just notice the followings : first , a finiteness of the variance of @xmath18 with respect to a pure state @xmath121 is equivalent to that @xmath122 is in the domain of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , from the mathematical point of view , the assumption of a finiteness of the variance of @xmath18 allows us to avoid a domain - problem for unbounded operators .",
    "second , the von neumann equation holds when the variance of @xmath18 is finite , which is the essential reason for the theorem [ thm : weaker ] to be correct @xcite . we plan to discuss and provide a systematic investigation for the case of unbounded hamiltonians in the forthcoming paper , including a complete proof of theorem [ thm : weaker ] .",
    "we have discussed the problem how one can detect possible correlations between the system of interest @xmath0 and an environment from the knowledge ( by observations ) of the system @xmath0 only .",
    "we conjectured statement ( b ) , from which one can conclude non - zero correlations with some environment when the time derivative of the reduced purity is not zero . in some sense",
    ", it is a counterpart of statement ( a ) ; one can conclude no correlations when the reduced purity is @xmath24 using statement ( a ) , while one can conclude correlations when the time derivative of the reduced purity is not zero .",
    "for instance , an experimentalist first can use statement ( a ) , and if his / her state is in a pure state , he / she can conclude no correlations .",
    "if the state is in a mixed state , then he / she can use statement ( b ) and check the time - derivative of the purity .",
    "if the time - derivative is not zero , he / she can conclude the existence of correlations , provided that statement ( b ) is universality true . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the validity of statement ( b ) for arbitrary quantum mechanical systems .",
    "when the total hamiltonian is bounded , we proved it to be universally correct ( theorem [ thm : weak ] ) , by giving a more general statement ( theorem [ thm : strong ] ) which quantitatively implies statement ( b ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : strong ] also clarifies the cause of a purity - change ( decoherence ) due to an interaction and correlations . however , when the total hamiltonian is unbounded , we have also shown a counter example of statement ( b ) . in the example , the reduced purity evolves essentially as a weierstrass function even with a product initial state , whence the differentiability of the reduced purity has been broken down in statement ( b ) .",
    "therefore , a certain modification is necessary for statement ( b ) .",
    "if one considers a state with a finite variance of energy as a natural realization in nature , one can conclude the universality of statement ( b ) for all the generic states in that sense .",
    "however , considering our original goal to estimate a possible correlation , especially for the situation where we do not know anything about environment ( other than our theoretical knowledge of quantum theory ) , it is preferable to assume nothing additional for an environment @xcite . in order for this",
