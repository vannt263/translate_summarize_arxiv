    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are probably associated with core - collapse supernovae ( hjorth et al .",
    "2003a ) and can be used to probe the interstellar medium of their star - forming environments .",
    "one of the open issues on the nature of grbs is the dust properties in the circumburst medium . on the one hand , high heavy - element column densities",
    "have been measured in a few grb afterglow spectra ( savaglio et al . 2003 ; vreeswijk et al . 2004 ) , suggesting that the dust content might be important , especially if star formation is very active . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of other grb afterglows indicates that dust reddening is surprisingly low ( galama & wijers 2001 ; hjorth et al .",
    "2003b ) . up to now",
    ", a simultaneous analysis of heavy - element abundances to measure the dust depletion , and of a suitable uv / optical spectrum to estimate the dust extinction law , in the same grb , has never been done .",
    "afterglows fade so rapidly that obtaining high - quality spectra , for a full investigation of the dust properties , is very difficult .",
    "[ f1 ]    the spectrum of grb  020813 , obtained recently by barth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , offers us this opportunity .",
    "the optical spectrum has a very high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , is very well flux - calibrated , and shows very little deviation from a perfect power law over a large wavelength interval ( @xmath12 in @xmath13   rest frame ; fig .  1 ) .",
    "moreover , the absorption lines of numerous different elements , with different refractory properties , have been detected with exceptional accuracy , thanks to the excellent spectral resolution . by visually inspecting the grb spectrum",
    ", it can already be noticed that there is no sign of the 2200   extinction feature ( @xmath14 hz ) , or curvature on even larger wavelength intervals , suggesting either an extinction law different from the galactic type or a low dust content .",
    "our approach to studying the dust depletion is similar to what has been done routinely for years for strong absorption systems detected in qso spectra , the so - called damped ly@xmath15 ( dla ) systems .",
    "the spectrum of grb  020813  shows similar absorption features , most of which are associated with low - ionization species , so we consider this absorption system a grb - dla .",
    "barth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) detected seven low - ionization species ( , , , , , and ) , and the lines are so strong that the absorbing gas is very likely neutral ( h @xmath16 ) .",
    "qso - dlas provide detailed information on the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) of high redshift galaxies ( prochaska 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in  2 , we describe the measurement of the heavy - element column densities in the grb  020813circumburst medium ; in  3 we derive the heavy - element depletion pattern ; in  4 the visual extinction is estimated ; in  5 we constrain , given the dust depletion , the extinction curve ; and in  6 we summarize the results .",
    ".parameters for the absorption system at @xmath0 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ f7 ]    = 8.1 cm",
    "the extinction is proportional to the column of dust along the line of sight . in the solar neighborhood",
    ", a gas cloud with @xmath17 @xmath18   column density has @xmath19 visual extinction ( bohlin et al . 1978 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is about 1/4 lower in a large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cloud with similar column density ( prevot et al .  1984 ) ; however , this is compensated by the lower metallicity ( 1/4 solar ) .",
    "therefore , the visual extinctions for two clouds with similar columns of metals , one in the lmc and another in the solar neighborhood , are similar . the dust depletion in our grb - dla ( where [ fe / zn ] @xmath20 ) is closer to that in the lmc than that in the smc ( [ fe / zn ] @xmath21 in the former , [ fe / zn ] @xmath22 in the latter ; welty et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "if the dust in the grb  020813  circumburst medium were like that in the mw or lmc , we would derive a visual extinction related to the column density of dust @xmath23 by    @xmath24    here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the dust and metal columns , respectively , for a @xmath27 @xmath18  gas cloud with solar metallicity , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as before , are the dust - to - metals ratio and the total metal column in our grb - dla .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath6 values ( and relative 1 @xmath31 errors ) are listed in table 3 .",
    "the inferred @xmath6 values are all higher than 0.3 ( 95% confidence level ) , with a best fit , obtained for the wdh depletion pattern ( fig .  6 ) of @xmath32 .",
    "[ f8 ]    = 8.9 cm    [ f9 ]    = 8.5 cm      the qso - dlas are usually considered to be representative of the ism of the whole population of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the dust effects in qso - dlas are generally small : the visual extinction in 44 qso - dlas ( with detected , @xmath33 ) inferred using the same approach as above , is always @xmath34 .",
    "this difference from the extinction in the grb  020813  circumburst medium ( @xmath2 ) is indicated by the lower column densities and the larger [ fe / zn ] values typically seen in qso - dlas ( zinc and iron are among the least and most depleted elements , respectively ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  7 .",
    "the difference between grb - dlas and qso - dlas may be the result of an observational bias : qso - dlas are generally found in the foreground of optically selected qsos , and dusty qso - dlas are hard to find in such samples ( fall & pei 1993 ) .",
    "grbs are ( at least for some time ) much brighter than qsos and are detected by gamma - rays and so might be much less affected by this bias .",
    "moreover , we know that grbs are located in star - forming regions , where the densities are presumably higher than average , and large column densities of dust are not surprising .    the elements cr , mn , and si",
    "( in addition to fe ) also indicate relatively high dust depletion in grb  020813  ( fig .",
    "similar high depletions were found in the circumburst medium of three other grbs ( savaglio et al .",
    "2003 ) . in another grb - dla ( in grb  030323 ) , the [ fe / s ] is consistent with zero , indicating little or no dust depletion ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "since is not measured in this object , while is , we assume [ zn / s ] @xmath35 and report this point in figure  7 .",
    "the presence of dust in the grb circumburst medium can affect the observed grb continuum spectrum .",
    "the grb extinction law has never been determined by observation and is not known a priori . from the lack of apparent reddening in many grb spectra",
    ", it has been concluded in those cases that dust is absent or that the extinction law is a weak function of the wavelength ( gray extinction ; stratta et al.2004 ) .",
    "perna et al . (",
    "2003 ) have shown , using numerical simulations , that the grb x - ray / uv radiation field can significantly flatten the dust extinction curve .",
    "we have already derived the heavy - element depletion pattern in grb  020813 , from which we inferred the visual extinction to be relatively high , @xmath2 , assuming the same rate of visual extinction as in the mw or lmc per unit of metal column density .",
    "however , the observed spectrum shows very little deviation from a perfect power law and no sign of the 2200 extinction feature ( fig .  1 ) , which allows us to place strong constraints on the extinction curve of the intervening dust .",
    "we use a fairly general approach , namely , we assume that the intrinsic grb emission is a power law    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath15 are not fixed a priori , and we apply a dust extinction law of the form    @xmath38    we vary @xmath15 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 and @xmath6 , and compare the corresponding model spectrum with the observed grb  020813  spectrum using @xmath40 minimization . because we are mainly interested in the confidence levels ( cl ) of only two of these four parameters ( @xmath6 and @xmath39 )",
    ", we project the four - dimensional confidence regions in the @xmath6 and @xmath39 space .    in figure  8 we show @xmath39 versus @xmath6 for constant cl ( _ solid lines _ ) . for @xmath41 ( as inferred from the dust depletion ) , any value of @xmath39 between @xmath42 and 0 is allowed ( 95% cl ) , and this would give an intrinsic grb spectral slope @xmath11 .",
    "the shaded vertical region is the one excluded by our depletion - pattern analysis .",
    "we also calculated the maximum @xmath6 values ( 95% cl ) obtained with mw , lmc , and smc extinction curves . for the mw and lmc extinctions , these give @xmath4 and @xmath43 , respectively , resulting from the absence of the 2200   extinction feature in the observed grb spectrum . for the smc extinction , which has a very weak 2200 bump , the constraint is @xmath44 .    in figure  9",
    ", we show the intrinsic and reddened grb model spectrum as compared to the observed spectrum . for the mw and mc extinction curves ,",
    "this is done for the maximum allowed @xmath6 value ( _ bottom three panels _ ) , while for the power - law extinction ( _ top panel _ ) , @xmath41 is assumed .",
    "since the upper limits on the visual extinctions inferred from mw and mc reddening ( @xmath5 ) are smaller than the lower limits inferred from the depletions ( @xmath2 ) , we have reached a contradiction and are forced to conclude that the dust in the circumburst medium of grb  020813  can not be like that in the mw and mc in all respects ( both chemical and optical properties ) .",
    "we note that although variations in the extinction law in different ob association stars have been found in the mw ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) , the presence of the 2200 bump is still very clear and would not be consistent with the observed grb spectrum .",
    "in this work , we studied , for the first time simultaneously , the dust depletion pattern and the extinction law in the circumburst medium of grb  020813 .",
    "very little is known about the dust properties in the circumburst medium of any other grb , mainly because the emission flux declines so rapidly that optical spectra are very hard to obtain .",
    "an excellent optical spectrum of the grb  020813  afterglow ( @xmath0 ) was obtained with the keck i lris @xmath45 hr after the burst by barth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , when the grb was still rather bright ( 19th mag in the optical ) . from the numerous and strong absorption lines detected in the spectrum , we measured the column density of six heavy elements ( zn , si , cr , mn , fe , and ni ) .",
    "the relative abundances resemble the galactic dust - depletion patterns , from which we infer a visual extinction @xmath46 , and @xmath2 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "the relatively high visual extinction in grb  020813  is hard to reconcile with the observed uv grb continuum spectrum , which deviates very little from a perfect power law , suggesting low reddening .",
    "however , this can be explained if the extinction curve is only a weak function of the wavelength .",
    "we constrained the shape of the extinction curve , assuming the power - law form @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath10 .",
    "this high visual extinction rules out the possibility of mw , lmc , or smc reddening , for which only @xmath48 , respectively , are allowed .",
    "the mw and lmc extinctions are also constrained by the absence of the 2200   extinction feature .",
    "a moderately high visual extinction is not surprising if grbs originate in regions of intense star formation and high density ( hjorth et al .",
    "however , under some conditions , the grb itself could destroy some of the dust grains ( fruchter et al . 2001 ) .    finally , heavy - element column densities in the circumburst medium of this grb are considerably higher than those typically observed in qso damped ly@xmath15 systems ( about 10 times higher ) , which is likely the result of a selection bias in the latter .",
    "the comparison of the dust - depleted element fe , with the non - depleted element zn , in the gas phase , gives [ fe / zn ] @xmath20 , whereas in 44 qso - dlas ( @xmath49 ) this is [ fe / zn ]  @xmath50 ( 0.28 dex 1 @xmath31 dispersion ) , suggesting a higher dust content in the circumburst medium of grb  020813 .",
    "we are grateful to aaron barth and his collaborators for allowing us to use their keck spectrum of grb  020813 .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee , tim heckman , nicola masetti , simona mei , eliana palazzi , nino panagia , patrick petitjean , james rhoads , and ken sembach for interesting insights and alessandra aloisi for providing a table with the most up - to - date values of oscillator strengths .",
