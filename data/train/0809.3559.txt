    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; binaries between a white dwarf primary and a mass - donating late - type star ) which show optical outbursts typically with @xmath4 25 lasting 220  d with intervals of @xmath510  d to tens of years @xcite . these outbursts can be explained as a result of a sudden increase of mass - transfer rate within the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf due to a thermal - viscous instability . a boundary layer ( hereafter abbreviated as bl )",
    "is formed between the inner edge of the accretion disk and the white dwarf where matter transferred through the disk releases its keplerian motion energy and settles onto the white dwarf .",
    "bl is a target of euv and x - ray observations since its temperature becomes @xmath610@xmath7  k. @xcite and @xcite have predicted that radiation from the bl starts to shift from hard x - ray to evu when the high @xmath8 front arrives at the inner edge of the disk , because bl becomes optically thick to its own radiation .",
    "this prediction has been verified by a number of multi - waveband coordinated observations @xcite .",
    "the region around the inner edge of the disk is filled with a lot of intriguing but still unresolved issues . within the framework of the standard accretion disk , half of the gravitational energy",
    "is released in the accretion disk , and hence , the other half is released in bl .",
    "the observations in extreme - ultraviolet band of vw  hyi and ss  cyg , however , revealed that the fractional energy radiated from bl is only @xmath9% of the disk luminosity @xcite . according to the classical theory , the temperature of bl in outburst",
    "is predicted to be 25@xmath10  k @xcite , whereas the temperature estimated by ultraviolet and optical emission lines is constrained to a significantly lower range 510@xmath11  k @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies may be resolved if we assume that bl is terminated not on the static white dwarf surface but on a rapidly rotating accretion belt on the equatorial surface of the white dwarf .",
    "suggestions of the accretion belt , rotating at a speed close to the local keplerian velocity , have been reported from a few dne in outburst @xcite .",
    "mechanism has not been understood yet to drive a dwarf nova oscillation ( dno ) which is a highly coherent oscillation of soft x - ray and optical intensities with a period of 340  s . @xcite",
    "try to understand dno by assuming a magnetically driven accretion onto the accretion belt by enhancing a magnetic field the belt through a dynamo mechanism .",
    "one of the unresolved outstanding issues may be the origin of a hard x - ray optically thin thermal emission in outburst , since bl is believed to be optically thick . in order to identify its emission site , and to obtain some new insight on bl in quiescence as well , we planned to observe ss  cyg both in quiescence and outburst with the x - ray observatory suzaku @xcite .",
    "ss  cyg is a dwarf nova in which the @xmath12 white dwarf and the @xmath13 secondary star @xcite are revolving in an orbit of @xmath14 @xcite with a period of 6.6 hours . the distance to ss  cyg is measured to be @xmath15  pc using hst / fgs parallax @xcite .",
    "ss  cyg shows an optical outburst roughly every 50 days , in which @xmath16 changes from 12th to 8th magnitude .",
    "the optically thin to thick transition of bl has clearly been detected with coordinated observations of optical , euve , and rxte @xcite . in   2 , we show an observation log and procedure of data reduction . in   3 ,",
    "detail of our spectral analysis is explained .",
    "owing to a high spectral resolution of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and a high sensitivity of the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ; @xcite ) over 10  kev enable us to determine spectral parameters of hard x - ray emission of ss  cyg with unprecedented precision . in   4 , we discuss on the emission site and its spatial extension both in quiescence and outburst by utilizing the spectral parameters , a 6.4  kev iron line parameters in particular .",
