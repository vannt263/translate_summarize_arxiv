    "one of the most exciting possibility from qcd is that hadronic matter undergoes a rich and varied phase landscape with increasing densities . at extremely high densities ,",
    "the mass of strange quarks becomes unimportant and all the three flavors of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 quarks can be treated on an equal footing .",
    "consequently , quark matter is in the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite and/or a new gapless cfl phase ( gcfl ) @xcite . however ,",
    "if densities are not that high , the strong interactions between quarks become important , and quark matter is in the unpaired phase .",
    "presently , rhic is teaching us about the properties of the hot but not asymptotically hot quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "actually the future fair project which will be built in the coming years at gsi in germany is targeted towards the physics of ultradense matter like it is found in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the original idea of witten is that strange quark matter ( sqm ) , rather than the normal nuclear matter , might be the true ground state of the strong interaction @xcite . immediately after witten s conjecture , farhi and jaffe showed that sqm is absolutely stable near the normal nuclear saturation density for a wide range of parameters @xcite .",
    "now sqm has been investigated for more than two decades since the pioneer works of many authors @xcite . because the lattice gauge theory still has difficulty in the consistent implementation of chemical potential in numerical simulations presently @xcite",
    "while the perturbative approach is unreliable at the strong coupling regime , phenomenological models reflecting the characteristics of qcd are widely used in the study of hadrons , and many of them have been successfully applied to investigating the stability and properties of sqm .    an important question in the study",
    "is how to incorporate pressure balance .",
    "basically , one uses a model to give the thermodynamic potential , then add to it a constant to get mechanical equilibrium .",
    "this is the famous ` bag ' mechanism .",
    "many important investigations have been done in this direction .",
    "a common feature of these investigations is that quark masses are constant , so the normal thermodynamic formulas can be used without thermodynamic inconsistency problems .",
    "actually , however , it is well known in nuclear physics that particle masses vary with environment , i.e. , the density and temperature .",
    "such masses are usually called effective masses @xcite .",
    "effective masses and effective bag constants for quark matter have been extensively discussed , e.g. , within the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite and within a quasiparticle model @xcite . in principle ,",
    "not only masses will change in the medium but also the coupling constant will run in the medium @xcite .",
    "the question now is how to treat the thermodynamic formulas which do not violate the fundamental principles of thermodynamics , when introducing density and/or temperature dependent masses .",
    "in fact , a lot of problems have been caused in this field .",
    "there exist in literature several kinds of thermodynamic treatments .",
    "the first one uses all the thermodynamic formulas exactly the same as in the constant - mass case @xcite",
    ". the second treatment adds a new term , originated from density dependence of quark masses , to both pressure and energy @xcite .",
    "these two treatments were later proved to be inconsistent with the necessary thermodynamic requirement : their free energy minimum do not correspond to zero pressure @xcite .",
    "the third treatment adds the term from the density dependence of quark masses to the pressure but not to the energy , and the inconsistency disappear @xcite .",
    "another treatment is the addition of a new term to the thermodynamic potential .",
    "this has been done when masses depend on either temperature @xcite or chemical potential / density @xcite .",
    "however , if particle masses depend on both chemical / density and temperature , this way meets difficulties .",
    "we will discuss it further in the next section .    with the third thermodynamic treatment and the cubic root scaling @xcite , zheng _",
    "et al_.  have studied the viscosity of sqm and calculated the damping time scale due to the coupling of the viscosity and @xmath6 mode @xcite .",
    "this model has also been applied to investigating the quark - diquark equation of state and compact star structure @xcite .",
    "another important progress has been made recently by zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "they extended the quark mass density dependent model to finite temperature to let the model be able to describe phase transition . in this case , the quark masses depend on both density and temperature and the permanent confinement is removed .",
    "they use the third thermodynamic treatment mentioned above @xcite and parametrize the common interacting part of quark masses as @xcite @xmath7 % m_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\frac{b_0}{3n_{\\mathrm{b } } } % \\left[1-\\left(\\frac{t}{t_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right)^2\\right ] $ ] with @xmath8 being the critical temperature .",
    "later , they found this parametrization causes an unreasonable result : the radius of strangelets decreases with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "so they added a new linear term , and the parametrization became @xcite @xmath9.\\ ] ]    this extension of the model has soon been applied to the study of strangelets @xcite , dibaryons @xcite , and proto strange stars @xcite , etc ..    the purpose of the present paper is two - folded .",
    "first , we would like to point out that the thermodynamic derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite is mainly concentrated on density dependent masses .",
    "when masses are also temperature dependent , there are special issues to be considered .",
    "we will prove that the temperature dependence of quark masses causes another term which contributes to the entropy and energy . with the new term , originated from the temperature dependence of masses , added to the entropy , the quark mass scaling eq .",
    "( [ sumass2 ] ) has a serious problem , i.e.@xmath10 which leads to a non - zero entropy at zero temperature , violating the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "therefore , our second purpose is to derive or suggest a new quark mass scaling , and then study the properties of bulk sqm and strangelets .",
    "an interesting new observation is that low mass strangelets near @xmath0 equilibrium are multiquark states with an anti - strange quark , such as the pentaquark @xmath11 for baryon number 1 and octaquark @xmath12 for dibaryon etc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
