    "magnetic systems are promising candidates for the development of fast , high - density , nonvolatile memory technology @xcite .",
    "two typical examples of commercial storage systems are magnetic random access memory ( mram ) and spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory ( stt - mram ) .",
    "thereby , the magnetic state of nanomagnets is used for the information storage .",
    "the switching or writing process is driven by an external magnetic field in mram or by a spin - polarized electric current in stt - mram . in mram ,",
    "built - in wires in every memory cell are required for the switching of a nanomagnet , i.e. the magnetic field must be generated by passing a current through a wire .",
    "the extra wires not only make the device circuit complicated and thus hinder the high density , but also generate current to result in energy dissipation and overheating . in contrast , by using the spin transfer torque effect , stt - mram allows for high density .",
    "but it is not a low - power method .",
    "usually , a high current density in the order of @xmath1 a / m@xmath2 @xcite is required for the switching of a nanomagnet with an acceptable endurance , leading to high energy dissipation .",
    "therefore , in order to realize the low - power and high - density memory devices , a method without electric currents are ideally desired .",
    "recently , the control of magnetism by pure electric fields without electric currents provides one viable way for the future low - power next - generation spintronics based memory devices . this strategy can be realized in multiferroic materials which possess more than one ferroic effects and the coupling between two of them .",
    "for example , through the magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling between the electrical polarization of a ferroelectric material and the magnetization of a ferromagnet , the control of magnetization by an electric field is achievable . nevertheless , the me coupling is weak in single phase systems .",
    "such a control is usually implemented through the me coupling in heterostructures .",
    "generally , in me heterostructures an electric field can manipulate the magnetization through the interfacial mechanisms such as strain - mediated elastic coupling @xcite , charge modulation @xcite , interface bonding @xcite , and exchanging coupling @xcite .",
    "since strong elastic coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic phases at room temperature can be achieved across their interfaces , strain - mediated me effect is one of the most promising candidates and it is thus most extensively investigated in ferromagnetic / ferroelectric heterostructures . in this scenario , a strain generated in a ferroelectric layer by an electric field",
    "is transferred to the ferromagnetic layer through the interface and thus controls the magnetization through the magnetoelastic coupling . due to the long - range nature of the elastic coupling , the strain - mediated me effect",
    "works at the bulk level . on the contrary",
    ", all the other three mechanisms are localized to the region near the interface .    in order to establish the",
    "strain - mediated me effect as a feasible strategy in the future practical memory devices driven by electric fields , two technical features should be clarified .",
    "firstly , only if the ferromagnet persists in the new state and does not revert back to the old state after withdraw of the electric field , can this me effect be applied to memory devices .",
    "it means that the magnetic states induced by the electric field should be nonvolatile .",
    "secondly , an electric - field induced deterministic 180@xmath0 magnetization switching should be achievable , since it determines the reliability and performance of spintronics based memory devices .",
    "for example , in order to attain a high signal - to - noise ratio in magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) for spintronics , a significantly large electric resistance change of mtj is required , which can only be achieved by a 180@xmath0 switching in the free layer of mtj .",
    "trailblazing experiments have demonstrated strain - mediated @xcite , charge - mediated @xcite , and exchange - coupling - mediated @xcite voltage - driven 180@xmath0 switching in ni / batio@xmath3 , bifeo@xmath3-based , and cofeb / mgo / cofeb heterostructures , respectively . from the theoretical side ,",
    "a large number of studies have focused on the strain - mediated 180@xmath0 switching either by designing the magnet shape @xcite or by using the 3d precessional switching dynamics @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study both the volatility of magnetic states and the magnetization switching dynamics excited by the electric field through mechanically coupled phase field simulations . by taking the model heterostructure system which contains the soft nanomagnet co and the piezoelectric substrate 0.7pb(mg@xmath4nb@xmath5)o@xmath3 - 0.3pbtio@xmath3 ( pmn - pt )",

    "the nanomagnet is assumed to be much smaller than the substrate so that the strain transferred from the pmn - pt to the co nanomagnet is nearly uniform .",
    "meanwhile , due to the small magnetostrictive coefficient and small size of co , the magnetization rotation or switching in co has little influence on the electromechanical behavior of the piezoelectric substrate .",

    "from the viewpoint of information storage such as binary logic and memory applications , the magnetic states triggered by an electric field should be nonvolatile .",
    "this requires that the magnetic states should be robustly kept after the removal of the electric field . as the first step",
    ", we explore the electric field induced equilibrium magnetic states , in order to figure out whether the nonvolatile state is achievable when the electric field is applied for a sufficient long time without a precise control of time . the initial state is a single domain along the @xmath60 axis ( fig .",

    "2 presents the equilibrium magnetic states when an electric field of @xmath61 kv / cm is applied .",
    "it can be found that the electric field induced equilibrium magnetic states are dependent on the the nanomagnet size .",
    "if the size is small ( e.g. @xmath62 nm ) , a single - domain state survives with the magnetization perpendicular to the plane .",
    "such a state possesses high magnetostatic energy and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy , but low magneto - elastic energy .",
    "the role of the latter energy surpasses that of the former two energies in the small - sized sample , thus leading to a single domain . on the contrary , in the case of large size ( e.g. @xmath63 nm ) , we attain a vortex structure in which the magnetization near the vortex core gradually tilts out of plane .",
    "the vortex is a result of substantially reducing the exchange energy and slightly increasing the magnetostatic energy and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy . in the region outside the vortex",
    ", the magnetization almost lies in the plane due to the dominating role of the magnetostatic energy .",
    "when the in - plane size is large , the magnetostatic energy will be very large if the magnetization deviates from the plane . if the in - plane size is neither too small nor too large ( e.g. @xmath64 nm ) , the magnetostatic energy and the magneto - elastic energy are comparable",
    ". then we have an intermediate state , in which neither single domain nor perfect vortex state exists .",

    "the stability of these magnetic states should be further examined .",
    "for example , in the case of equilibrium single domain ( e.g. @xmath62 nm ) , we find that after removing the electric field , the magnetization will either revert back to the initial state or switch to the negative z axis .",

    "was also observed in elliptical cobalt nanomagnets in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "both the vortex state and the initial single - domain state are local energy minima .",
    "but in order to get the vortex state from the initial single - domain state , the nanomagnet has to experience the state with high exchange energy so that the formation of a curling magnetic structure is possible",
    ". therefore , an energy barrier exists between these two states .",
    "when this energy barrier is overcome by the magneto - elastic energy which is introduced from the electric field , the magnetization will be driven from the initial single - domain state into the vortex state . moreover , due to its local minimum , the vortex state can persist after the removal of the electric field .",
    "this explains the transition from fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) to fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) .",
    "in addition , since the vortex state is extremely stable , the electric field is obviously not sufficient to drive the magnetization out of the vortex state .",

    "<S> electric - field control of magnetism without electric currents potentially revolutionizes spintronics towards ultralow power . here by using mechanically coupled phase field simulations , we computationally demonstrate the application of the strain - mediated magnetoelectric effect for the electric - field control of magnetic states in heterostructure . in the model heterostructure </S>",
    "<S> constituted of the soft nanomagnet co and the piezoelectric substrate pmn - pt , both the volatility of magnetic states and the magnetization switching dynamics excited by the electric field are explored . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that an electric field can drive the single - domain nanomagnet into an equilibrium vortex state . </S>",
    "<S> the nanomagnet remains in the vortex state even after removing the electric field or applying a reverse electric field , i.e. the vortex state is extremely stable and nonvolatile . only by utilizing the precessional magnetization dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> the 180@xmath0 magnetization switching is possible in small - sized nanomagnets which are free of the stable vortex state . </S>",
    "<S> electric - field pulses can realize the deterministic 180@xmath0 switching if the electric - field magnitude , pulse width , and ramp time are carefully designed . the minimum switching time is found to be less than 10 ns . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide useful information for the design of low - power , reliable , and fast electric - field - controlled spintronics . </S>"
