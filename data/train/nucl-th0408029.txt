    "among the possible collective motions in a nucleus , free rotation occupies a unique position . since it is not accompanied by dissipative processes of frictional type , it is a thermodynamically equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "this means that , generally speaking , the strictly reversible interaction of the different degrees of freedom of the system and the rotation does not lead degradation of the latter .",
    "as long as the shape of the nucleus is characterized by the presence of the dynamical variable @xmath5 ( the unit vector along the symmetry axis of the figure ) , the corresponding isentropic sequence of levels  the rotational band  will be continued .",
    "however , the interaction with the other degrees of freedom does , despite being completely reversible , significantly complicate the situation in precisely the section of the rotational band hitherto most accessible to experimental study .",
    "the point is that with increasing rotational quantum number @xmath6 there is an increased tendency for the mechanical angular momenta of the individual quasiparticles to be aligned along the direction of the total angular momentum vector @xmath7 . ultimately , this phenomenon will be completely analogous to the alignment of the magnetic moments of fermions in a magnetic field , and then the rotation properties will become fairly simple ( for more details , see ref .  [ 1 ] ) .",
    "however , at low or moderate nuclear spins @xmath8 ( the notation is as before [ 12 ] ) there is generally not even one single - quasiparticle state within the zone of possible alignment near the fermi boundary . because of this",
    ", the tendency to alignment along @xmath7 is not manifested even here in a pure form .",
    "coupling of the nucleons to the axis @xmath5 of the nucleus begins to compete with it , and with a sufficient decrease in the spin @xmath6 the symmetry of the rotational state is lowered .",
    "let us consider briefly how these circumstances are reflected formally in the quantum - mechanical description of rotational states .",
    "it is well known that in the case of adiabatically slow rotation the total wave function of a nonspherical nucleus can be represented in the form of the product is actually a pseudo - scalar , so that , strictly speaking , analogous term , corresponding to the value @xmath9 , should be added to the right - hand side of eq .  ( 1 ) . in the special and in practice most common and important case @xmath10 of even - even nuclei there is no need for such a term and eq .",
    "( 1 ) is valid as it stands . ]",
    "@xmath11 here , @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is a wigner function , and @xmath14 is the set of so - called internal variables that the nucleus would possess if it were not in motion .",
    "but in the general case for arbitrary spins there is a superposition @xmath15 and the rotational density matrix is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability of the given value of @xmath18 [ on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the internal wave functions @xmath19 are not normalized ] .    at and above the curie point @xmath0 we have @xmath20 . physically ,",
    "this can be interpreted as the final breaking of the coupling between a nucleon and the axis of the nucleus , after which the distribution of the vector @xmath5 over the directions in empty space naturally becomes isotropic , and the quasiparticles tend to be aligned only along @xmath7 .",
    "formally , this corresponds to @xmath21 for @xmath22 , i.e. , all @xmath18 are equally probable . for a concrete example , fig .",
    "1 illustrates the experimental picture of the phase transition due to the increased symmetry of the rotational state . in fig .  1",
    ", the phase transition ( backbending ) can be seen very clearly . of the rotation",
    "is not , in essence , a function of the state ( 2 ) .",
    "it is determined by the distance between the two neighboring rotational levels .",
    "therefore , the discontinuity of the rotational velocity in fig .  1 does not contradict the continuous nature of the phase transition . ]",
    "since the rotation does not destroy the equilibrium , the thermodynamic treatment makes it possible to establish a number of bounds for the rotational characteristics . in this connection",
    ", we mention a feature of the present - day experimental situation . at present",
    ", the critical spin @xmath0 has not yet been reached for many nuclei and their rotational bands , so that the existing data refer exclusively to the lower phase @xmath23 .",
    "do these data predict the position of the phase transition point ? as a rule",
    ", this question must be answered in the negative . however , the thermodynamic inequalities permit one , by extrapolating the data on the lower phase , to find the limits between which the true value of @xmath0 lies . in the cases ,",
    "also fairly numerous , when the critical value has already been determined experimentally , the reliability and effectiveness of this procedure can be tested directly .",
    "the overwhelming majority of experimental data of interest in this connection correspond to the ground - state rotational bands of even - even nuclei ( the so - called yrast lines ) . in",
    "what follows , we shall have in mind mainly this special case .",
    "the modifications needed in some of the expressions in the more general case will be indicated separately .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the energy in a coordinate system rotating uniformly with angular velocity @xmath25 ( see , for example , refs .  3 and 4 ) . the lowest state @xmath26 of the rotational band",
    "can always be regarded formally as non - rotating in the sense that this state minimizes the energy ( 4 ) for @xmath27 . in principle",
    ", one can go over from it to any other state of the band by specifying a corresponding @xmath28 .",
    "then the value of @xmath29 certainly does not increase as equilibrium is approached .",
    "bearing in mind also that @xmath30 for the original , non - rotating nucleus , we readily obtain @xmath31 for any rotational level .    applied to rotating bodies , this is entirely equivalent to the notion of the so - called minimal work [ 4 ] which in the given case is @xmath32 . in the immediate neighborhood of equilibrium ,",
    "the energy @xmath29 has a local minimum .",
    "this yields the inequality @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the variable moment of inertia ( the appendix to the preceding ref .",
    "1 gives a corresponding simple calculation , though interpreted from a somewhat different point of view ) .",
    "so far we have considered inequalities that hold equally in either of the phases .",
    "we now turn to a more definite examination of each of them separately .",
    "we shall label the lower phase @xmath35 by the index @xmath36 , and the upper , @xmath37 , by the index @xmath38 .",
    "where necessary , the additional index @xmath39 will be used directly at the curie point @xmath40 .",
    "first of all , we use some of the results obtained in refs .  1 and 2 for the upper phase .",
    "it is difficult to visualize clearly its properties near the transition point , at which the moment of inertia exhibits pole behavior : @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is some constant coefficient ) .",
    "after it has passed through the `` super - rigid - body '' region adjoining the curie point , the moment of inertia sinks to a minimum , and then tends to the rigid - body asymptotic form @xmath43 from below . over the complete upper phase , the reciprocal value of the moments of inertia cancels out : @xmath44",
    "it can be concluded from this that the section from some particular running value @xmath6 to infinity makes a negative contribution to the integral ( 9 ) . as a result , using eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we readily obtain @xmath45 i.e. , in the upper phase the ratio of the angular momentum to the angular velocity exceeds the rigid - body value . equality is attained only at the phase transition point @xmath46 itself , and also asymptotically as @xmath47 ; for more details , see ref .  1 .",
    "the theoretical investigation of the behavior of the moment of inertia of the lower phase is made difficult by its low symmetry , and the coupling scheme of the angular momenta is complicated and itself changes continuously as a function of the spin @xmath6 .",
    "we shall consider this question in detail only for the lowest part of the ground - state rotational band .",
    "this consists of the levels @xmath48    the energy @xmath26 of the levels can be represented as the expectation value of the hamiltonian of the nucleus with respect to the true wave function ( 2 ) , which is a superposition of different @xmath18 .",
    "but if the expectation value is found in accordance with the approximate function ( 1 ) , the result @xmath49 is an overestimate : @xmath50 we shall assume that the averaging over the trial wave functions ( 1 ) is made in two stages , the first with respect to the internal variables @xmath51 since @xmath52 for the rotational band in which we are interested , the wigner functions reduce to spherical functions , and the new hamiltonian will act only on them . under these conditions ,",
    "the scalar operator must be expressed in terms of @xmath53 , and we write the corresponding expansion in the form @xmath54 ^ 2+\\ldots.\\ ] ] here , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the adiabatic moment of inertia , and @xmath57 .",
    "we expand the true energy @xmath26 in the usual series in powers of @xmath6 . in the limit as @xmath58 the first and second derivatives of the energies @xmath59 and @xmath60 are equal , since otherwise it would be impossible to have the adiabatic approximation expressed by the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 12 ) ( the bohr - mottelson formula ; see , for example , refs .  5 and 6 ) .",
    "the difference required by the inequality ( 11 ) arises only in the cubic term of the expansion , and the corresponding coefficient @xmath61 has the order of magnitude @xmath62 ( in fact , the expansion is in powers of the ratio @xmath63 , ; in accordance with the previous ref .  2 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the limiting momentum of the fermi distribution , and @xmath66 is the radius of the nucleus ) .",
    "thus , @xmath67 and , using eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we obtain @xmath68 i. e. , the moment of inertia increases near the base of the rotational band .",
    "the inequality ( 14 ) agrees with experiment .",
    "however , numerous experimental data on the ground - state rotational bands indicate that in them the monotonic growth @xmath69 of the moment of inertia with the spin also holds in the entire lower phase @xmath1 .    bearing this in mind",
    ", one can draw a number of conclusions about the ratio of the angular momentum to the angular velocity .",
    "we transform the derivative of this ratio in accordance with eq .",
    "( 7 ) : @xmath70 since @xmath71 we have @xmath72 i.e. , the ratio of the angular momentum to the angular velocity also increases .",
    "we now use an inequality obtained earlier in ref .  2 : @xmath73 which determines the sign of the discontinuity of the rotational velocity at the phase transition point , and the relation @xmath74 to which eq .",
    "( 9 ) is essentially equivalent [ see also the text following eq .  ( 9 ) ] .",
    "then @xmath75 we have previously estimated the integral @xmath76 from below .",
    "we now obtain an upper bound : @xmath77 the unified expression of the inequalities ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) is @xmath78    in the lower phase , the ratio of the angular momentum to the angular velocity is less than the rigid - body value but exceeds the adiabatic value @xmath79 of this ratio ( in practice , the accuracy of this last assertion is limited by the circumstance that we have in fact ignored the specifically quantum  zero - point rotation \" : @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is also well known that the inequality @xmath81 agrees with experiment .",
    "we find first the boundaries of that region on the @xmath82 plane within which the upper phase can in principle exist .",
    "combining the inequalities ( 5 ) and ( 10 ) , we obtain @xmath83 this means that the part of the @xmath26 plot corresponding to the upper phase is situated entirely to the right of the parabola @xmath84 [ see fig .",
    "overall , the curve of the energy of the rotational levels is continuous , @xmath85 , since we have a second - order phase transition .",
    "ultimately , the smallest possible value @xmath3 of the critical spin is determined by the transcendental ( and in practice empirical ) equation @xmath86 ^ 2/i_0,\\qquad j_c\\geq j_c^{min}.\\ ] ] the prescription for finding the upper limit @xmath4 is clear from eqs .",
    "( 10 ) , ( 17 ) , and ( 18 ) ; see also fig .",
    "2(b ) . in the plane @xmath87 the upper phase begins on the straight line @xmath88 and is situated to the right of it .",
    "the lower phase can not penetrate to this region , for otherwise the sign of the discontinuity of the rotational velocity at the phase transition point prescribed by the inequality ( 17 ) would be reversed [ the monotonic growth of the moment of inertia of the lower phase expressed by the inequality ( 15 ) does not permit it to return to the left of the line @xmath88 ; see also eq .",
    "the upshot is @xmath89 to avoid confusion , we emphasize that the graph of @xmath90 is discontinuous ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) ; therefore , @xmath4 does not coincide with the true @xmath0 but exceeds it .",
    "has a certain singularity here .",
    "however , we have already noted that at least the first and second derivatives of this function do not become infinite as @xmath91 . ]    a typical formulation of the problem is as follows .",
    "suppose that , in contrast to the example in fig .  2 , there are data on only the lower phase .",
    "we denote @xmath92 the highest value of the spin for which the rotational velocity and the moment of inertia are known [ since calculations in accordance with eqs .",
    "( 7 ) actually require the taking of finite differences , the spin @xmath93 of the last of the experimentally detected levels is in practice usually higher and equal to @xmath94 .",
    "first , it is readily seen that as long as @xmath95 the graph of @xmath90 moves away from the broken straight line in fig .",
    "2(b ) , but when the requirement @xmath96 is satisfied it moves towards this straight line .",
    "this makes it possible to find an upper bound on the discontinuity @xmath97 of the angular velocity of rotation of the nucleus : @xmath98 but if @xmath99 , i. e. , the lower limit of the critical spin has already been passed experimentally , then in eq .",
    "( 25 ) it is necessary to replace @xmath3 by @xmath92 ( the requirement @xmath100 remains in force ) .",
    "we consider the cases in which the finding of the lower or the upper limit requires a comparatively short extrapolation of the existing data up the band .",
    "then we can restrict ourselves to the approximations @xmath101 substitution in eqs .",

    "( 26 ) usually has a very good accuracy .",
    "when the conditions of applicability of the expressions are violated , one must resort to graphical extrapolation .",
    "naturally , this has its shortcomings .",
    "finally , we consider a curious application of the boundary curve @xmath84 on the @xmath82 plane .",
    "the less symmetric lower phase is characterized by an order parameter , whose part is played by the static quadrupole moment @xmath103 . since its actually realized value must be energetically advantageous , this predetermines the sign of the discontinuity of the angular velocity in accordance with inequality ( 17 ) ( for more details , see the preceding ref .  2 ) .",
    "one can however also show that there exists a general restriction of the magnitude of the discontinuity @xmath104 as well .",
    "consider fig .",
    "the plot of @xmath26 crosses from left to right , the dashed parabola on which the derivative is @xmath105 , and @xmath106 along the band is here smaller .",
    "therefore , the inequality ( 16 ) enables us to conclude that @xmath107 expressing now in accordance with ( 18 ) the rigid - body moment of inertia in terms of the upper rotational velocity @xmath108 , we find that @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 thus , the magnitude of the abrupt decrease in the rotational velocity at the phase transition must not exceed half its original value @xmath111 .",
    "for several years , the compilation by sayer et al [ 7 ] served as the prime source of information on the ground - state rotational bands of individual nuclei . however , these data are now partly obsolete and many new data have been published .",
    "therefore , we have also used original papers [ 816 ] .",
    "references to some other sources of experimental data that we have used can be found in a later compilation of lieder and ryde [ 17 ] .",
    "the results for the ground - state rotational bands in which the phase transition has already been found are summarized in table i. the limits @xmath3 and @xmath4 were found in accordance with the scheme illustrated in fig .  2 ( see also the text ) .",
