    "in @xcite , we have introduced the notion of _ polarized regular twistor @xmath1-module _ on a complex manifold , and one of the main results was a _ decomposition theorem _ for the direct image of such objects by a projective morphism between complex manifolds .",
    "a consequence of this theorem was the proof of a particular case of a conjecture of mkashiwara , saying that the direct image by a projective morphism of an irreducible holonomic @xmath1-module on a projective manifold should decompose into direct sums of irreducible holonomic @xmath1-module on the target manifold .",
    "the particular case treated was that of a _ smooth _ twistor @xmath1-module .",
    "tmochizuki , through a very precise analysis of harmonic metrics on the complement of a normal crossing divisor in a projective complex manifold @xcite , succeeded in proving the equivalence @xmath2 on a projective manifold , giving therefore a proof of the conjecture of mkashiwara for semisimple regular holonomic @xmath1-modules .",
    "on the other hand , using the riemann - hilbert correspondence , one can state the conjecture for perverse sheaves , and it is equivalent to the conjecture in the regular case . from this point of view",
    ", the conjecture has been proved by vdrinfeld @xcite , modulo a conjecture of de  jong , partly proved later by gbckle and ckhare @xcite on the one hand and proved by dgaitsgory @xcite modulo results not yet written up on the other hand .",
    "the goal of this article is to introduce a category of ( polarized ) wild twistor @xmath1-modules .",
    "conjecturally , on any projective manifold , this category ( in the polarized case ) would be equivalent to the category of semisimple holonomic @xmath1-modules , and this would provide us with a tool for an analytic proof of the conjecture of mkashiwara for ( possibly non regular ) semisimple holonomic modules .",
    "we develop , in this context , an idea of pdeligne @xcite for defining nearby cycles for irregular @xmath1-modules .",
    "however , we do not give here any result in the direction of the previous conjecture .",
    "one would need to develop an analysis of harmonic metrics analogous to that developed by tmochizuki for tame harmonic metrics .",
    "nevertheless , in dimension one , such kind of results have been obtained by obiquard and phboalch @xcite .",
    "the main result of this article ( theorem [ th : orbnilp ] ) is an analysis of the behaviour of wild twistor @xmath1-modules on a riemann surface in the neighbourhood of the singularities .    in the recent preprint @xcite",
