    "with modern computational power has come the ability to examine the low lying eigenvectors of the dirac operator and hence their spatial correlation with instantons and other related objects thought to be involved in chiral symmetry breaking and confinement @xcite . while these studies focused primarily on the local relationship between instantons and low - lying dirac eigenmodes ( ldes ) , other models of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking involving objects of lower co - dimension are popular , based on monopoles , vortices , and hybrid objects @xcite .",
    "presumably these objects would have a rather different effect on the ldes than 4-dimensional instantons , due to their different co - dimension .",
    "furthermore , a recent study @xcite has suggested a dense layered 3-dimensional structure to the ldes .",
    "one difficulty is the quantitative characterization of localization of the ldes or related quantities such as the topological charge density . in @xcite localization of the ldes",
    "was studied using the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) which yields a number characterizing the localization of an eigenmode .    by studying the scaling dimension of the ipr",
    ", we can find the co - dimension of the structures which localize the ldes , thus giving some insight as to the possible confining objects and mechanism .",
    "the ipr of a normalized field @xmath0 is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of lattice sites @xmath3 .",
    "here we use @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the @xmath6-th , normalized ( @xmath7 ) , lowest eigenvector of the dirac operator .    with this definition , @xmath8 characterizes the inverse `` fraction '' of sites contributing significantly to the support of @xmath9 ( we now drop the subscript @xmath6 ) .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the ipr takes the following values for these simple situations : @xmath10    suppose that the objects responsible for confinement , or indeed any physics governing the lowest dirac eigenmodes , localize the ldes . as the lattice spacing is reduced , the fraction of sites contributing to the ipr scales as @xmath11 .",
    "thus the ipr indicates the co - dimension of these objects : @xmath12 for instantons , @xmath13 for monopoles , and @xmath14 for vortices .",
    "gauge dislocations should contribute as @xmath15 objects , however their density diverges as @xmath16 so that they should give a @xmath17constant contribution : @xmath18 ) .",
    "since the ipr @xmath19 , if we reduce the lattice spacing at fixed physical volume , we have @xmath20 on the other hand , increasing the volume at fixed lattice spacing includes proportionately more of the confining objects , whatever their dimension .",
    "thus we expect the ipr to remain constant , @xmath21",
    "we have explored these two regimes using quenched lattices generated with the tadpole improved symanzik gauge action , and the parameter set shown in table 1 . on each lattice",
    "we computed the lowest eight eigenvectors of the asqtad dirac matrix .",
    ".lattices analyzed [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see clear evidence for lower dimensional scaling as @xmath22 with co - dimension between 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 1 shows both the distribution of the iprs and the scaling of the averages .",
    "the data points are fit to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants and @xmath26 .",
    "the reduced chi squared values for the fits are 6.7 , 3.2 , and 45 for @xmath271 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .    in figure 2",
    "we show the behaviour of the ipr as we increase the volume at fixed lattice spacing ; it is rather unaffected , as we expected above .",
    "we can also investigate the localization of the topological charge density by computing the ipr from @xmath28 , where we have normalized @xmath29 .",
    "we have computed @xmath30 by successive hyp smearing sweeps @xcite on the @xmath22 series , and show the results in figure 3 ( note that only 5 hyp smearing steps were performed on the @xmath31 lattice set ) . while this plot does not show us new information on the localization of the ldes , it is nonetheless instructive .",
    "first , we see that all lattices without smoothing have an ipr = @xmath32 .",
    "this is the value expected if the field is a gaussian fluctuation at each site , regardless of its width .",
    "we further see the approach to a stable localization of topological charge versus hyp smearing as the lattice spacing is decreased ( at fixed volume ) .",
    "we note that @xmath33ipr@xmath34 is not large , meaning that @xmath30 is not strongly localized .",
    "also , it increases as @xmath35 as for the ldes .",
    "the main result of this study is the indication of a localization of the low - lying dirac eigenmodes on surfaces of co - dimension between 2 and 3 , qualitatively supporting the center vortex or monopole pictures of confinement .",
    "note , however , that the singularities of _ thin _ objects ( vortices or monopoles ) are expected to be smoothed out by the qcd interactions and become _ thick _ , with a size @xmath36 .",
    "thick objects fill a fixed fraction of space , not a divergent one .",
    "the indication we have , via the divergence of @xmath33ipr@xmath34 as @xmath22 , of localization on singular manifolds , is remarkable , whatever these manifolds are .    9 ph",
