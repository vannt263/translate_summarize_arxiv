    "the disorder reduces the mobility of the quasiparticles . in the strong disorder regime ,",
    "the variance of the conductance @xmath0 coincides with the predicted value for disordered metals , whereas in the weak disorder regime , @xmath0 is larger than the universal value due to the absence of back - scattering , characteristic of the honeycomb lattice of graphene  @xcite .",

    "sensitive andreev reflections occur for energies lower than the superconducting energy gap @xmath5 . at the n - s interface , an electron coming from @xmath11 couples with its time - reversed counterpart to form a cooper pair which can enter into @xmath12 . the phase coherent andreev states at the n - s interface can be destroyed by applying a magnetic field which breaks time reversal symmetry , by increasing the temperature , or by applying a large source - drain voltage .    in this work",

    "for simplicity we assume that @xmath81 is constant .",
    "this is an approximation , as it is known that there are surface effects and it is plausible that adsorbates must have the biggest effect on the mobility of the first layer . with this assumption",
    "we can write for the total conductance @xmath1 of the flgnr @xmath85 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the width and length of flgnr , respectively .",

    "however , we stress that physically we deal with one flgnr with one given @xmath28 number .",
    "the reduced change on the gate - voltage to the left of the cnp suggests that the carrier density is markedly increased on the hole side leading to an enhanced quantum capacitance .",
    "as the cnp is strongly on the positive side , the flgnr is substantially hole doped .",
    "this hole doping may be caused by states that are induced by the source and drain contacts .",

    "this estimate is obtained by linearly extrapolating @xmath0 from the high bias down to zero bias ( lower dashed line in figure  5 ) .",
    "this extrapolation yields @xmath204@xmath10 for the variance @xmath0 of the whole two - terminal sample .",
    "the reduced magnitude of the conductance variance ratio @xmath205 is not unexpected , taking the energy of the lowest temperature and the finite ac - bias modulation into account , which both lead to saturation of @xmath185 at the lowest bias voltage in figure  5 .",
    "the reduction of the saturation value @xmath0 from the expected ` universal ' value can be caused by finite coherence . in the context of interference correction",
    "two parameters are important at zero magnetic field : the thermal length @xmath206 and the phase - breaking length @xmath207 .",
    "the thermal length , sometimes also termed the coherence length , is given by @xmath208 . with @xmath209@xmath210/s",
    ", we obtain @xmath211 nm . at the lowest temperature , the devices crosses therefore over into the fully coherent regime .",
    "hence , the reduced value of @xmath0 must primarily originate from a finite phase - breaking length @xmath212 .    to compare further with theory ,",
    "a value of @xmath213@xmath14 was predicted for a graphene ribbon with normal metal contacts  @xcite . for the geometry of our device this would translate into @xmath214@xmath14 .",
    "our estimated normal state @xmath0 value is two times smaller .",
    "this can be used to estimate an effective coherence length @xmath207 by using standard averaging along the length of the ribbon  @xcite , yielding @xmath215 . with @xmath21 being",
    ", we estimate a phase - breaking length of at and consequently a phase - breaking time .",
    "the bias dependence of @xmath0 has not been studied systematically in graphene - superconductor devices .",
    "however some data are available in the literature . in the recent experiments on single graphene layer contacted with pt",
    "/ ta superconducting leads the conductance variance at @xmath216mk was found to be @xmath217@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "though this value is substantially larger than ours , a comparison has to take the larger width @xmath20 into account ( @xmath218@xmath107 m and @xmath219 nm ) .",
    "it turns out that also in this experiment the measured value is lower than the full coherence value , which we estimate to @xmath220@xmath14 using the expression @xmath221 .    in nanostructures made of inas nanowires contacted with ti",
    "/ al leads  @xcite the saturation value of the conductance variance in the superconducting state was found to be @xmath222@xmath14 at @xmath223mk @xcite and @xmath224@xmath10 in the normal state yielding an enhancement of @xmath225 , whereas in @xcite at @xmath226@xmath14 in the superconducting state was found with an enhancement factor of @xmath227 compared to the normal state .",
    "both the normal state values and the enhancement factors for the superconducting state of these results are in good agreement with our observations in a ti / al contacted few layer graphene nanoribbon .",
    "in recent experiments with niobium contacted inas nanowires a surprisingly large enhancement factor of @xmath228 was found  @xcite .",
    "the reason for such a strong enhancement is that the coherence length of the nanowire and the dephasing length @xmath207 is much larger than the distance between the contacts , so that multiple andreev charge transfer which contributes to fluctuations can occur at the interface .",
    "the increased conductance variance signals the transition into the superconducting state of the whole device .",
    "in conclusion , our measurements of a few - layer graphene nanoribbon contacted with ti / al leads show pronounced ucf - type conductance fluctuations .",
    "we observe a decrease of the conductance variance with applied source - drain voltage with a characteristic cross over for bias voltages corresponding to the superconducting energy gap @xmath5 . for voltages below @xmath229",
    "the conductance variance is enhanced by a factor ranging between @xmath191 and @xmath16 which is close to the theoretically predicted value of @xmath202 .",
    "the finite phase - breaking length @xmath230 at the base measurement temperature of @xmath197mk is the reason for the remaining discrepancy .",
    "this work is financially supported by the nccr on nanoscale science , the swiss - nsf and eu - fp6-ist project hyswitch .",
    "we are grateful to the psi ( paul scherrer institute ) for the thermal oxidation of our si wafers .",
