    "the conventional view is that the universe becomes reionized at some point in the redshift range @xmath13 , when the uv emission rate in galaxies with virial temperatures greater than @xmath14k ( where hydrogen atoms are efficient coolants ) exceeds the overall recombination rate ( e.g. , barkana & loeb 2001 ; madau 2002 ) . at the time of this writing the redshift range",

    "in this paper we present a new scenario . in the context of the standard cold dark matter cosmological model",
    "we show that the universe was first reionized at @xmath15 by population iii ( pop iii ) stars and second reionized at @xmath8 .",
    "following the first reionization , the transition from pop iii stars to pop ii stars occurs . at this point photoionization becomes insufficient to counterbalance the rapid recombination process and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) recombines to become opaque to ly@xmath2 and ionizing photons , again ! as time progresses , with increased density fluctuations and the nonlinear mass scale star formation rate gradually picks up . at @xmath1 the global star formation rate exceeds the global recombination rate and the universe is completely reionized for the second time , and for all . from the first cosmological reionization through the second cosmological reionization the mean temperature of the igm",
    "is maintained at @xmath9k balanced between compton cooling and photo - heating and hydrogen is more than half ionized balanced between recombination and photoionization .",
    "we show that this new reionization picture is inevitable , _ as long as pop iii initial mass function ( imf ) is top - heavy _ , thanks to a new , powerful constraint placed on the product of star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies at high redshift , which otherwise would be unknown .",
    "this constraint comes from two solid pieces of observations : 1 ) the universe is required to be reionized at @xmath1 and 2 ) the density fluctuation in the universe at @xmath1 is well determined by the same small - scale power traced by the observed ly@xmath2 forest observed at @xmath3 .    while it is clear that the ionizing sources for the second cosmological reionization are stars in large galaxies with efficient atomic line cooling , the ionizing sources for the first cosmological reionization are uncertain to the extent that we do not know what the relative star formation efficiencies in large halos and minihalos are .",
    "we define  minihalos \" as those whose virial temperature is less than @xmath16k where only 2 cooling is possible in the absence of metals , and large halos as those with virial temperature above @xmath16k capable of cooling via atomic lines .",
    "we show that , if star formation efficiency in minihalos with 2 cooling is not more than a factor of ten less efficient than in large halos with atomic cooling , then pop iii stars in minihalos may be largely responsible for the first reionization .",
    "conversely , the first reionization may be attributable largely to pop iii stars in large halos .    in order to enable efficient 2 cooling in minihalos",
    "it is necessary to maintain an adequate level of 2 molecule fraction within their cores .",
    "as is well known , 2 molecules are fragile and easily destroyed by photons in the lyman - werner ( lw ) bands ( @xmath17ev ; field et al .",
    "1966 ; stecher & williams 1967 ) , to which the universe is largely transparent .",
    "primeval 2 molecules have been completely destroyed well before enough ionizing photons are produced to reionize the universe ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ; tegmark et al .",
    "therefore , an adequate production rate of 2 molecules is required to counteract the destruction rate to keep 2 fraction at a useful level .",
    "a sufficiently high x - ray background at high redshift could serve as a requisite catalyst for forming 2 molecules by deeply penetrating into and generating a sufficient number of free electrons in the cores of minihalos ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 ; haiman , abel , & rees 2000 ; ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2001 , rgs hereafter ; glover & bland 2002 ) .",
    "we put forth two new mechanisms for generating a high x - ray background during the pop iii era .",
    "we point out that at @xmath18 pop iii supernova remnants and miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes are efficient x - ray emitters . the much higher density of the interstellar medium at high redshift results in a much more rapid and earlier cooling phase of the supernova blast waves , emitting a large fraction of the cooling energy in x - ray energy ( @xmath19kev ) .",
    "[ in contrast , supernova blast waves in the local galaxies are known not to cool efficiently until their temperatures have dropped well below the x - ray regime ( e.g. , cox 1972 ; chevalier 1974,1982 ) ] .",
    "miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes of mass @xmath20 are expected to emit a large fraction of the radiation in x - rays at @xmath21kev .",
    "the combined x - ray emission from these two sources is sufficient to enable efficient 2 formation and cooling in the cores of minihalo galaxies in the redshift period in question .",
    "in addition , an important process for producing a large number of 2 molecules in relic hii regions of pop iii galaxies is quantified .",
    "it is shown that 2 molecules produced by this process may overwhelm the lyman - werner photons produced by stars in the same pop iii galaxies . as a result",
    ", the lyman - werner background may have never built up in the first place during the pop iii era . in combination , we suggest that star formation in gas - rich minihalos can continue to take place largely unimpeded throughout the first reionization period .",

    "we adopt this new theory for pop iii stars , called very massive stars ( vms ) . however , we note that the main conclusions drawn in this paper will remain unchanged as long as the initial mass function of pop iii stars is substantially top - heavy ( e.g. , umeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",

    "a spherically expanding supernova remnant at sufficiently late times follows the simple , adiabatic , self - similar sedov - taylor solution ( sedov 1959 ; taylor 1950 ; shklovsky 1968 ; cox 1972 ; ostriker & cowie 1981 ) .",
    "specifically , the shock radius ( @xmath36 ) , shock velocity ( @xmath37 ) and postshock temperature ( @xmath38 ) ( for @xmath39 ) obey : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the explosion energy in @xmath44ergs , @xmath45 is the time elapsed since the onset of explosion in @xmath46yr and @xmath47 is the density of the interstellar medium in @xmath34",

    "since the blast waves of the first generation of supernovae propagate into a primordial gas free of metals , metal cooling is non - existent . more importantly ,",
    "complex processes due to dust need not to be considered ; in particular , x - ray emission would not suffer significantly from dust absorption ( ostriker & silk 1973 ; burke & silk 1974 ; draine & salpeter 1979 ; shull 1980 ; wheeler , mazurek , sivaramakrishnan 1980 ; tielens et al .  1987 ; draine & mckee 1993 ) . combining equations ( 3,4 ) and solving for @xmath38 as a function of @xmath47 give results shown in figure 1 , for two cases with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , where the former may be appropriate for supernovae / hypernovae resulting from very massive pop iii stars ( woosley & weaver 1982 ; ober et al .",

    "a critical point to note is that the density of the general interstellar medium should scale with @xmath59 , being significantly higher at high redshift than that of the local interstellar medium .",
    "this assumption should hold in the context of cosmological hierarchical structure formation for the following reasons .",
    "first , the mean gas density scales with @xmath59 .",
    "second , halos at low and high redshift in cosmological simulations show similar properties when density and length are measured in their respective comoving units ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; del popolo 2001 ) .",
    "third , the spin parameters ( i.e. , angular momentum distribution ) of both high and low redshift halos have very similar distributions peaking at a nearly identical value @xmath60 ( peebles 1969 ; white 1984 ; barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; ueda et al .",

    "the same argument was given in kaiser ( 1991 ) on a somewhat larger scale for clusters of galaxies .",
    "peebles ( 1997 ) , using the same scaling of density with respect to redshift , suggested that an early epoch of galaxy formation may be favored .",
    "observationally , the higher density in bulges of spiral galaxies or elliptical galaxies are consistent with their earlier formation epochs . in figure 1",
    "we have used @xmath63 , with @xmath64@xmath34 being the density of the local interstellar medium , to translate the bottom x - axis ( @xmath47 ) to the top x - axis ( @xmath65 ) .    in figure 1",
    "we see that , at @xmath66 ( or @xmath67@xmath34 ) , the blast wave enters the rapid cooling phase at a postshock temperature slightly above @xmath68k .",
    "most of the energy is radiated away during the brief cooling phase ( falle 1975,1981 ) with photon energy @xmath69 .",
    "[ subsequent evolution of the cooling shell will be subject to various instabilities ( e.g. , chevalier & imamura 1982 ; vishniac 1983 ; bertschinger 1986 ; cioffi , mckee & bertschinger 1988 ) .",
    "following that , the evolution enters snowplow phase driven by the pressure of a still hot interior gas ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ; ostriker & mckee 1988 ) . ] for a primordial gas cooling at @xmath68k , it is found that @xmath70 of the instantaneously radiated energy is at photon energies above @xmath71kev , respectively .",
    "clearly , a significant amount of the total energy of the supernova blast wave will be turned into x - ray photons .",

    ", the emitted photons from supernova remnant shell cooling would be still harder .",
    "as a consistency check we find that , for @xmath67@xmath34 , at the onset of the rapid cooling phase , the elapsed time is @xmath72yr , the shell radius is @xmath73pc , the swept - up interstellar medium mass is @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that @xmath75 is much larger than the mass of the supernova ejecta ( @xmath76 ) guarantees the sedov - taylor solution for the regime in question ( until cooling sets in ) .",
    "the fact that the shell radius @xmath77 is much smaller than the size of galaxies ( @xmath78pc ) and @xmath75 is much smaller than the total baryonic mass in the galaxies ( @xmath79 ) in question indicates that the blast wave at the cooling time is still sweeping through high density interstellar medium , as was assumed . as another consistency check ,",
    "the time required for electrons and ions to reach temperature equilibrium is @xmath80yr for the case considered , which is much shorter than @xmath81 , indicating that electrons can radiate away the shock heated thermal energy and that sedov - taylor phase is valid .",
    "in contrast , in the star - burst model for agn ( terlevich et al .",
    "1992 ) , the proposed supernova remnants interact with a much higher density medium ( @xmath82@xmath34 ) such that the sedov - taylor phase is never reached due to extremely rapid cooling before thermalization .    in brief",
    ", a large fraction of supernova explosion energy in pop iii galaxies at @xmath32 , possibly as large as @xmath83 , is shown to be converted into x - ray photons with energy greater than @xmath84kev .",
    "the x - ray background produced by this process will be shown below to be able to play a positive feedback role in the formation of and cooling by 2 molecules in minihalos .",
    "let us now proceed to identify the characteristics of the composite spectrum of the background radiation field produced by both emissions from the vms and the thermal emission from vms supernova blast waves .",
    "a relevant parameter for our purpose is the ratio of the energy in the lw bands ( @xmath85ev ) to the energy in photons with @xmath86kev , @xmath87 .",
    "photons in the lw bands ( @xmath17ev ) are primarily responsible for photodissociating 2 molecules and are not heavily absorbed by intervening intergalactic atomic hydrogen ( except for the saw - tooth modulation by the atomic lyman line series ; haiman , abel , & rees 2000 ; har hereafter ) .",
    "hard x - ray photons at @xmath86kev , on the other hand , are also largely unabsorbed by intervening atomic hydrogen and helium and capable of penetrating deeply into the cores of minihalos to produce free electrons through both direct photo - ionization and secondary photo - electron ionization .",
    "the abundance of 2 molecules in the cores of minihalos is primarily a result of the competition between the two .",
    "in contrast , photons with energy in the range @xmath88ev@xmath89kev are heavily absorbed by atomic hydrogen and helium prior to complete reionization of the universe and thus have little effect on the formation of 2 molecules in the cores of minihalos ( byt see rgs for a positive feedback due to ionizing photons on the surface of the expanding hii regions and in relic hii regions ) .",
    "we may write @xmath90 approximately as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the fraction of energy in the lw bands emitted by vms ; @xmath93 is the speed of light ; @xmath94 is the characteristic mass of vms ( @xmath95 ; see  3 ) ; @xmath96 is the explosion energy of a typical vms ; @xmath97 is inserted to take into account the effect that some vms ( for example , non - rotating stars with @xmath98 ; rakavy , shaviv , & zinamon 1967 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; glatzel , fricke , & el eid 1985 ; woosley 1986 ) do not produce supernovae ( but collapse wholly to black holes ) .",
    "the supernova explosion energy , @xmath96 , released by vms in the mass range @xmath99 is approximately @xmath100erg ( woosley & weaver 1982 ; ober et al .",
    "1983 ; bond et al .  1984 ; nakamura et al .  2001 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "the vms has approximately a blackbody radiation spectrum with an effective temperature of @xmath101k ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ; bromm et al .",
    "2001 ) for which it is found that @xmath102 , yielding @xmath103 is it small enough to enhance 2 formation in minihalos ? let us compare to the results of a systematic study of the effect of x - ray photons on the cooling of minihalo gas by har .",
    "har investigated the effect using a @xmath104 background radiation spectrum , with an upper cutoff at @xmath105kev .",
    "using @xmath106 to parameterize their results , the findings of har are that , when @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) , 2 formation is enhanced and cooling by 2 is sufficient to allow for the gas in the cores of minihalos with virial temperature @xmath109k to collapse to form stars .",
    "we note that in evaluating @xmath110 above we have taken into account a factor of @xmath111 underestimation of @xmath110 in the original work of har due to a factor of @xmath112 underestimation of the lw photon absorption cross section by 2 molecules ( haiman 2002 , private communications ; rgs ; glover & brand 2002 ) .",
    "the correction factor @xmath112 is a lower limit in the optically thin case for 2 molecules for the cores of minihalos . in the optically thick limit",
    ", a substantially larger correction factor needs to be applied ( i.e. , @xmath110 would be substantially larger than @xmath113 ) , although the exact effect would require a re - calculation of the results in har .",
    "it thus appears that the x - ray emission from pop iii supernova remnants alone may be able to produce enough x - ray photons relative to the number of photons in the lw bands such that production rate of 2 molecules dominates over the destruction rate in most of the minihalos .",
    "another direct consequence of pop iii vms is an inevitable production of a significant amount of black holes .",
    "pop iii vms more massive than @xmath114 would eventually implode carrying the entire mass to form black holes ( rakavy , shaviv , & zinamon 1967 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; glatzel , fricke , & el eid 1985 ; woosley 1986 ) without producing explosions .",
    "pop iii vms less massive than @xmath115 , after about three million years of luminous life , would explode as supernovae or hypernovae leaving behind black holes of mass @xmath116 ( heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "these pop iii black holes could accrete gas from surroundings to shine as miniquasars .",
    "the likelihood of gas accreting onto these black holes is at least as high as in their lower redshift counterparts since the gas density is higher and halos tend to have somewhat lower spins at high redshift . in the case of the very massive pop iii black holes ( @xmath98 )",
    "formed without explosion , gas may be ready to accrete immediately , as the surrounding gas has not been blown away .",
    "the dynamics of the black holes in these environments in the context of cosmological structure formation is a complex subject and can only be treated in separate works .",
    "here we make the assumption that these black holes would accrete gas and grow .    the characteristic gas temperature of a disk powered by accretion onto a black hole is ( rees 1984 ) : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the black mass in @xmath119 . for @xmath120 , we have @xmath121k . while the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of quasars powered by supermassive black holes is known to contain a significant fraction in x - rays ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , the miniquasars at high redshift powered by much smaller black holes will be conspicuous in x - rays , probably emitting predominantly in x - ray band from both thermal and nonthermal emission .",
    "a somewhat more quantitative argument may be made as follows .",
    "the sed of observed quasars powered by supermassive black holes of mass @xmath122 contains a substantial amount of energy in the x - rays but the largest concentration of energy appears to peak at @xmath123ev ( uv bump ; elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) barring the unknown gap between uv and x - ray . under the reasonable assumption that the sed peak frequency scales with the characteristic temperature @xmath124 , then the peak frequency for pop iii black hole powered miniquasars would be shifted ( by a factor of @xmath125 compared to quasars ) to @xmath126kev .",
    "let us now compute the x - ray background produced by miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes .",
    "we put this quantitatively in the context of the ratio of energy in lw photons to that of x - ray photons .",
    "first , an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "if a miniquasar has accreted a fraction , @xmath127 , of the initial mass of the black hole , the radiated energy will be @xmath128 where @xmath2 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath106 may be written as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the fraction of mass collapsed into pop iii stars ; @xmath131 is the fraction of mass in @xmath130 that ends in black holes ; @xmath132 is radiative efficiency of the miniquasars in units of @xmath133 ; @xmath134 is the fraction of energy radiated by miniquasars with photon energy greater than @xmath135kev ; @xmath136 is the x - ray escape fraction from miniquasars ; we have used @xmath102 .",
    "the value of @xmath132 is thought to be close to unity ( rees 1984 ) and the value of @xmath134 is expected to be of order unity . the fraction of mass in pop iii stars ultimately collapsing to black holes @xmath131 is also of order unity , if either pop iii stars are very massive @xmath35 or @xmath137 .",
    "the accretion fraction @xmath127 would depend on the gas accretion rate and the formation time of the black hole ; parameterization by equation ( 10 ) would be fairly accurate if black holes formed long time ago . but a more accurate way to compute the x - ray energy from miniquasars is to integrate over time over all miniquasars by parameterizing each radiating at @xmath138 times the eddington luminosity .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 , where the solid and dotted curves show @xmath139 with radiative efficiency of @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "the global pop iii star formation rate is computed using press - schechter ( 1974 ) formula considering all halos with virial temperature greater than @xmath141k .",
    "the reason that the dotted curve with lower radiative efficiency ( @xmath142 ) lie below ( i.e. , emits more x - ray photons than ) the solid curve is that the black hole mass in this case grows at a faster rate , being inversely proportional to the radiative efficiency .",
    "another useful way to estimate the growth of mass in black holes is to follow the local observed black hole mass - bulge mass relation , @xmath143 , ( magorrian et al .",
    "if the same ratio of the mass in black holes to bulge mass , which at high redshift may be equated to the total stellar mass , holds at high redshift , then we can readily compute the energy liberated by gas accretion onto pop iii black holes as @xmath144 the horizontal dashed line in figure 2 indicates @xmath139 computed this way with radiative efficiency of @xmath145 and x - ray escape fraction @xmath146 .    from figure 2",
    "it is evident that @xmath147 is significantly smaller than @xmath148 ( equation 7 ) , at @xmath149 , required to induce sufficient 2 cooling in minihalos ( har ) .",
    "the higher value of @xmath139 at higher redshift ( @xmath150 ) is due to the fact that the age of the universe becomes much shorter than the eddington time of @xmath151yr and the black holes have not had enough time to accrete a substantial amount of gas ; the age of the universe is @xmath152yr at @xmath153 ( for @xmath154km / s / mpc , @xmath23 , @xmath25 ) .    in summary , two distinctive mechanisms , namely supernova remnants and miniquasars ,",
    "each appears to be able to generate enough x - ray emission at @xmath32 to provide positive feedback on star formation in subsequent ( other ) minihalos by making a sufficient number of x - ray photons relative to the number of destructive photons produced in the lw bands .",
    "the combination of the two should ensure that enough x - ray radiation is produced as a result of pop iii star formation .",
    "in addition , there may be other , significant x - ray emission mechanisms such as inverse compton emission ( e.g. , hogan & layzer 1979 ; oh 2001 ) or massive x - ray binaries ( e.g. , bookbinder et al .  1980 ; helfand & moran 2001 ) . moreover , additional positive feedback mechanisms , such as that proposed by ferrara ( 1998 ) due to enhanced 2 formation in the supernova cooling shells , that put forth by rgs from the enhanced 2 formation at the surfaces of strmgren spheres of individual pop iii galaxies and that quantified in the next section (  3 ) due to 2 formation in relic h ii regions produced by pop iii galaxies will further help promote 2 formation .",
    "taking all the processes together , it appears highly likely that the chief obstacle to continuous 2 formation and cooling in minihalos is removed .",
    "since the assumption that x - ray emission produced by these two processes related to pop iii star formation can produce positive feedback to subsequent star formation is important , it is warranted to have independent checks .",
    "we will compare our results to glover & brand ( 2002 ; gb hereafter ) .",
    "we compare to their x - ray emission model due to inverse compton , which has luminosity density @xmath155 , where @xmath156kev and @xmath157 is the fraction of supernova energy transferred to relativistic electrons . integrating @xmath158 over a range @xmath159kev",

    "while even this model is already sufficient to enable molecular cooling in halos with @xmath168k to reionize the universe at @xmath167 ( see figure 5 below ) , it is expected that the much smaller @xmath90 computed above for pop iii stars in our model would further drive the critical virial temperature to much lower values and enable star formation in almost all minihalos , consistent with the conclusions reached by har .",
    "while the positive feedback due to a high x - ray background produced by pop iii supernovae and miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes seems sufficient to sustain continuous gas cooling in gaseous minihalos , we quantify another important source for production of 2 , which was first pointed out by rgs .",
    "each pop iii galaxy creates an hii region ( strmgren sphere ) around it .",
    "since the lifetime of a pop iii galaxy of @xmath169yr is comparable to and somewhat shorter than the hydrogen recombination time , @xmath170yr at @xmath62 , we may assume for simplicity , without causing substantial errors , that the size of the strmgren sphere is just determined by the number of ionizing photons emitted , @xmath171 .",
    "we follow the evolution of such a relic hii region after the death of a pop iii galaxy , in the absence of any external radiation field .",
    "we solve a set of rate equations and energy equation for relevant species in an h ii region free of metals .",

    "figure 3 shows the fraction of 2 molecules as a function of redshift for four h ii regions formed at @xmath172 , evolved up to redshift @xmath173 , which will be identified as the first reionization epoch by pop iii stars (  4 ) .",
    "we see that the 2 fraction in h ii regions shows a sharp rise at an early time and flattens out at later times .",
    "the reason for this asymtotic convergence may be understood by examining figure 4 , where the temperature evolution of the gas in the region is shown . 2 formation rate decreases with decreasing temperature ( abel et al .",

    "a critical ratio here is the number of 2 molecules produced over the number of lw photons produced , denoted as @xmath176 . for @xmath171 ionizing photons emitted by pop iii stars , there will be approximately @xmath177 hydrogen atoms ionized in the h ii region . at the same time",
    ", the number of lw photons produced by the same stars is @xmath178 . from figure 3 , we take an approximate average @xmath179 for the abundance of 2 molecules produced by @xmath173 . then , we obtain @xmath180 . since about @xmath181 lw photons",

    "it thus appears that 2 molecules produced in the relic h ii regions produced by pop iii stars may be sufficient to offset the production of lw photons by the same stars .",
    "consequently , lw radiation background may never be able to build up during the pop iii era .",
    "however , a more careful calculation , taking into account the density fluctuations among others , is needed to precisely quantify this positive feedback effect .",
    "but we defer such a calculation to a future work",
    ". nevertheless , it seems possible that this positive feedback in relic h ii regions may be more effective than that proposed by ferrara ( 1998 ) due to enhanced 2 formation in the supernova cooling shells and that put forth by rgs from the enhanced 2 formation at the surfaces of strmgren spheres of individual pop iii galaxies .    in summary",
    ", it appears that lw radiation background may have never been able to build up to destroy 2 molecules in subsequent minihalos . in the event that lw radiation background was able to build up ,",
    "its intensity would have been substantially reduced .",
    "the fact that the x - ray background produced by pop iii supernovae and miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes have already been capable of countering an undiminished lw radiation background ( i.e. , by ignoring all the 2 molecules produced by these positive feedback processes ) leads us to conclude that subsequent star formation in minihalos will not be hindered by previous star formation in the pop iii era .",
    "we will examine the evolutionary history of the igm from a very early redshift ( @xmath22 ) until the universe is completely reionized at @xmath1 , as suggested by recent observations .",
    "rather than taking a brute - force approach , which will be deferred to a later work , we will use a new , fast monte carlo - like approach to economically sample parameter space .",
    "this method , we hope , should be capable of capturing the essential physical processes involved .    at any time the gas in the universe consists of @xmath182 distinct regions in the two - dimensional phase space specified by @xmath183 , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the temperature and neutral hydrogen fraction , respectively , and @xmath182 is a varying number .",

    "such a level of ionization is adequate to enable the formation of a sufficient amount of 2 molecules to supply ample cooling at @xmath224k ( har ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ) and star formation should continue to take place in any gaseous halo . looking forward to the results , it turns out that the condition for 2 cooling has a rather small effect for the second cosmological reionization , since the amount of intergalactic gas able to accrete onto minihalos is very small .",

    "the sum of ionized gas over all the phase space regions at each time step creates a separate ( hii ) region in the phase space with a mean temperature equal to @xmath233 where the first term inside the parentheses on the right hand side is the temperature of region @xmath186 and the second term accounts for photo - heating , with @xmath234 set to @xmath235k ( varying @xmath234 from @xmath236k to @xmath237k does not significantly change the results ) we set the initial neutral fraction of the newly created hii region to @xmath238 , although results obtained do not depend on the exact choice for this value , as long as it is a small number .",

    "new hii regions created may originate from a combination of regions , some of which have previously been ionized but subsequently recombined , some of which were never ionized and some of which may be recently created hii regions but now get percolated .",
    "we do not include a photoionization term on the right hand side of equation ( 14 ) , rather , equivalently , we remove the fraction of gas in that region that is being ionized and add it to a new phase space region according to equations ( 12 and 22 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that gas is ionized when ionization front passes through , and is not ionized uniformly .",
    "one important difference between this method and another commonly used method which computes the filling factor of hii regions ( e.g. , shapiro & giroux 1987 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; madau et al .  1999 ; miralda - escud , haehnelt , & rees 2000 ) is that we follow the evolution of all regions including hi , hii regions and partially ionized regions .",
    "this is important for our purpose , chiefly because at high redshift hii regions experience rapid recombination and cooling .",

    "to self - consistently compute the imf , we follow the metal enrichment history of the intergalactic medium . most importantly , there is a critical transition at some point in redshift in the metallicity of the igm , when a certain amount of pop iii stars have formed .",

    "subsequently , the mean temperature of the igm is roughly maintained at @xmath293k , due to the works of two counter - balancing effects : substantial cooling reduces the jeans mass of the igm and would increase the star formation rate , which would then provide increased heating by photoionization .",

    "otherwise , most of the pop iii vms responsible for the first cosmological reionization would come from minihalos , where efficient 2 cooling is required .",
    "second , the igm is maintained at a rather  warm \" temperature @xmath303k from the first reionization through the second reionization ; i.e. , the universe is significantly heated up even in this  dark age \" preceding the second , complete reionization of the universe at @xmath1 .",
    "third , the igm is kept at a significantly ionized state throughout the second reionization period .",
    "finally , the overwhelming fraction of star formation activity responsible for producing the ionizing photons in the period from the first reionization through the second reionization are in large halos .",
    "the possible indication of a more top - heavy initial stellar mass function ( imf ) in early galaxies or earlier stages of galaxies than present - day imf ( salpeter 1955 ) was suggested five decades ago ( schwarzschild & spitzer 1953 ) .",
    "cosmological consequences of the first generation , massive stars at high redshift have been discussed in a variety of contexts ( e.g. , layzer & hively 1973 ; carr 1977 ; rees 1978 ; rowan - robinson , negroponte , & silk 1979 ; puget & heyvaerts 1980 ; tarbet & rowan - robinson 1982 ; carr , bond , & arnett 1984 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",

    "may be just emerging recently . while luck & bond ( 1985 ) and others have previously indicated the need for vms ( @xmath304 ) to explain the overabundant @xmath2 elements , qian , wasserburg and collaborators ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2000,2002 ; oh et al .",

    "oh et al .  (",
    "2001 ) have suggested this possibility based on the observed transition of abundance pattern at [ fe / h]=-3 in metal poor stars summarized by qian & wasserburg ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2000,2002 ) , who found that at lower value vms dominates the enrichment , whereas at higher value a sharp rise in the abundances of the heavy r - process elements such as ba and eu in galactic halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath305 signifies the occurrence of type ii supernovae of normal stars with masses of @xmath306 .    one may expect to see the pop iii star abundance patterns in low density regions of the universe , such as ly@xmath2 clouds or voids , where subsequent additional enrichment may be minute .",
    "recent work on ly@xmath2 clouds suggests that metal enrichment by pop iii stars be consistent with ly@xmath2 cloud observations and the necessary enrichment occur prior to @xmath307 ( the highest epoch for the available ly@xmath2 cloud data analyzed ) ( qian , sargent , & wasserburg 2002 ) .    one obvious advantage for pop iii supernovae to enrich",
    "the igm with the first metals at @xmath308 is that it is much easier to relatively uniformly disperse the metals across the igm for two reasons .",
    "first , the disturbances to the density and velocity fields are smaller at high redshift , because each pop iii galaxy needs to fill only a very small igm volume .",
    "second , any significant large - scale motions would decay away rapidly , in the absence of dynamical support . as a result , the excellent agreement found between simulations and observations with respect to the ly@xmath2 forest at @xmath309 ( cen et al .",

    "another possible consequence of supernova explosion and expulsion of the gas into the igm is the magnetic feedback to the igm .",
    "rees ( 1994 ) has first pointed out the importance of resident supernova remnants in galaxies being a substantial large - scale seed field for galactic dynamos .",
    "let us give a simple estimate here for the contribution of the pop iii supernova remnants to the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "folloing rees ( 1994 ) we should use local observations as a guide .",
    "the crab nebula ( a plerion ) has a magnetic field of strength @xmath310 currently occupying a sphere of radius @xmath311pc , totaling a flux of @xmath312 g  @xmath29 .",
    "assuming flux conservation and pop iii magnetic bubble filling factor of unity give @xmath313 , where @xmath314 is the mass of a typical pop iii star , @xmath315 is the zero - age main sequence progenitor star for crab ; @xmath316 is the fraction of baryons formed into pop iii stars ( see figure 14 ) by redshift @xmath291 when the transition from pop iii to pop ii occurs ; @xmath317 is the mean baryonic density at zero redshift ; @xmath318 is the redshift of ejection of the magnetic field into the igm ; we have assumed that the magnetic flux is approximately proportional to the stellar mass .",
    "inserting all the numbers gives @xmath319 g at @xmath291 and subsequently @xmath320 g . this magnetic field , having a significantly larger amplitude than that produced by gravitational shocks in the collapse of large - scale structure ( kulsrud et al .",
    "1997 ) , could serve as a seed field for subsequent galaxy formation .",
    "the mean separation between pop iii galaxies is of order @xmath321 comoving kpc .",
    "thus , if pop iii supernovae are responsible for enriching the igm relatively uniformly to a metallicity of about a thousandth of the solar value , it is also likely that the magnetic field lines originating from supernovae remnants would be stretched to fill up the intergalactic space , resulting in an initial magnetic field possibly coherent on scales as large as @xmath125kpc .",
    "in addition , miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes may produce mini radio jets , as would have been implied by the observational fact that radio jets are observed in accretion disks on a wide range of scales in a wide variety of astrophysical systems",
    ". the magnetic field from miniquasars may be as important as or more important than that from the pop iii stars ; but a reliable estimate is difficult .      without fine tuning the imf of pop iii stars , it seems likely that @xmath95 black hole from pop iii stars more massive than @xmath114 and smaller black holes ( @xmath322 ) from pop iii stars less massive than @xmath115 would form .",
    "the possible bimodality of the distribution of black hole mass is interesting but the consequences are too complicated to be easily outlined .",
    "those pop iii black holes will be building blocks for subsequent structures and the question is : where will they go ? in general , since there is no correlation between the small - scale structures that form pop iii galaxies and later structures , one would expect to find those black holes in all environments , including globular clusters , galactic disks , galaxy halos and intergalactic space .",
    "it is possible that the dynamic formation of halos and galaxies in hierarchical structure formation may be significantly altered in the presence of these massive black holes , especially in the cores of the relevant structures , such as globular clusters , galaxies , etc .",

    "it is quite possible that many globular clusters could be seeded by those black holes .",

    "miralda - escud & gould ( 2000 ) pointed out the possible existence of stellar black hole clusters at the galactic center .",
    "their reasoning may be equally applied here . since pop iii",
    "star mass fraction is of order of @xmath302 of total baryonic mass , as our calculation indicates , their should be @xmath325 black holes either having mass @xmath326 or @xmath327 ( noting that the mass fraction in black holes will be a factor about 10 lower for less massive black holes ) . the reader is encouraged to refer to miralda - escud & gould ( 2000 ) and also sigurdsson & rees ( 1997 ) for a detailed discussion of possible manifestations of such a black cluster , bearing in mind that the black holes here are more massive and may enhance some of the effects discussed .    in the hierarchical structure formation process , these pop iii black holes are expected to grow ( there are a large number of e - folding times available ) and merge , along with larger cosmic structures .",

    "we note that , for igm which is primarily metal enriched by pop iii stars , the overabundances of @xmath2-elements such as oxygen and silicon relative to the solar value ( heger & woosley 2002 ) would greatly increase the optical depth of the oxygen oi and siii absorption forests , at the apparent low metallicity ( defined by @xmath436\\sim 10^{-3}$ ] ) . this would substantially increase the number of observable oi and siii absorption lines predicted by oh ( 2002 ) .",
    "second , the relative optical depths of oi and siii absorption lines may shed light on the relative abundance of o to si , giving useful information on synthesis in pop iii stars ( qian & wassurberg 2000,2002 ) .",
    "in addition , gradually increasing contribution from pop ii supernovae ( type ii ) to the igm metals with time may also show up in the redshift evolution of the relative optical depths of oi and siii absorption lines , possibly providing information on the overall metal enrichment history of the universe at those early times .",
    "the author was made aware of an earlier paper by wyithe & loeb ( 2002 ) , who investigated the reionization histories due to stars and quasars .",
    "they assume that minihalos do not form stars at the redshift of interest but systematically explore the 2-d parameter space spanned by the ionizing photon escape fraction and the transition redshift from a vms imf and a normal imf .",
    "they pointed out that , for some restricted region in the parameter space , hydrogen and/or helium ii may be reionized twice .",
    "the primary differences between their study and the current study are three - fold .",
    "first , we show that 2 cooling thus star formation in minihalos takes place unimpeded , as long as gas is able to accrete onto them , whereas they do not consider star formation in minihalos .",
    "second , we constrain the ionizing photon escape fraction directly using ly@xmath2 forest observations . as a consequence ,",
    "we show that it seems inevitable that the universe will be reionized first by pop iii stars either in minihalos or in large halos and second by pop ii stars .",
    "finally , we use a new computational method to follow self - consistently the evolution of the entire igm , including hii regions , hi regions and partially ionized regions .",
    "the two studies are , however , complementary in their different approaches .",
    "venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull ( 2003 ) also examined the consequences of pop iii metal - free stars on the reionization of the universe .",
    "they indicated the possibility of reionizing he ii twice with an incomplete first attempt of reionizing he ii .",
    "mackay , bromm , & hernquist ( 2002 ) presented a three - phase reionization picture . with a top - heavy vms imf , they pointed out that the first transition from molecular cooling phase to atomic cooling phase occurs at @xmath4 , when their demand of 10 lyman - werner photons per baryon is met . the proposed first transition in mackay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is dictated by the lack of 2 cooling in minihalos .",
    "we pointed out here positive feedback and as a result there is no such transition .",
    "mackay et al .  ( 2002 ) find that at @xmath437 the igm has been enriched to a level of @xmath438 that the second transition to a normal imf occurs .",
    "their assessment of the transition epoch from pop iii to pop ii is consistent with but at a slightly higher redshift than our calculation .",
    "their universe , however , is not reionized until @xmath1 .",
    "it is noted in passing that mackay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) pointed out a novel pop ii.5 stellar population associated with cooling shells of pop iii supernovae . in summary , the primary differences between this study and that by of mackay et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are two - fold .",
    "first , we indicated that the positive feedback mechanisms on 2 formation allow star formation to occur in minihalos throughout the first reionization period up to @xmath439 .",
    "second , we constrain the ionizing photon escape fraction by the direct ly@xmath2 forest observations to eliminate this major uncertainty .",
    "perhaps the most uncertain in the chain of derivation is the imf of the pop iii stars .",
    "however , most of the main conclusions , including positive feedback of pop iii star formation and two times of cosmological reionization , are likely to hold for any sufficiently top - heavy imf . while the simulations with sub - solar mass resolution ( abel et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ) have clearly shown the formation of pop iii vms , it is yet unclear what the angular momentum transport mechanisms are .",
    "it is possible , in principle , that hydrodynamic processes , included in the quoted simulations , could transport the unwanted angular momentum outward , as the simulators have advocated .",
    "if local star formation is a guide , one could imagine that very massive pop iii stars may form in binaries or multiples , in which case angular momentum removal would be easily achieved .",
    "it is also intriguing to note that , if we extrapolate the observed ratio of super massive black hole to bulge mass ( e.g. , tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , then one would expect to find a black hole of mass @xmath440 at the center of each minihalo of mass @xmath441 .",
    "thus , perhaps one should not be too surprised that nature has managed to form a compact object ( star ) of mass @xmath35 formed at the center of a minihalo , if the quoted observations are any empirical guide ; it may be argued , angular momentum - wise , that it is a less stringent task to collapse a higher density gas cloud at higher redshift to form a star than a lower density gas cloud at lower redshift to form a black hole , as observed .",
    "we have ignored the possible contribution from quasars to the second reionization process . if the emission rate of ionizing photons from quasars is proportional to the star formation rate , as indicated by low redshift observations ( boyle & terlevich 1998 ; cavaliere & vittorini 1998 ) , then , to zero - th order , all that is needed is to renormalize @xmath202 such that the second reionization completes at @xmath1 and results would remain largely unchanged .",
    "the conclusions of this paper consist of two sets .",
    "\\i ) we put forth two new mechanisms for generating a high x - ray background during the pop iii era .",
    "namely , x - ray emission from the cooling energy of pop iii supernova blast waves and from miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes .",
    "we show , consequently , 2 formation in the cores of minihalos is significantly induced , more than enough to compensate for destruction by lyman - werner photons produced by the same pop iii stars . in addition ,",
    "another , perhaps dominant process for producing a large number of 2 molecules in relic hii regions created pop iii galaxies , first pointed out rgs , is quantified here .",
    "we show that 2 molecules produced by this process may overwhelm the lyman - werner photons produced by the stars in the same pop iii galaxies . as a result",
    ", the lyman - werner background may never be able to build up to affect 2 molecules in minihalos . in combination , we suggest that cooling and hence star formation in minihalos can continue to take place largely unimpeded throughout the first reionization period , as long as gas is able to accumulate in them .",
    "\\ii ) we show that the intergalactic medium is likely to have been reionized twice , first at @xmath15 and second at @xmath8 . under a very conservative assumption for the star formation efficiency in minihalos with 2 cooling ,",
    "the first reionization may be attributable largely to pop iii stars in large halos ; in this case , processes promoting 2 formation in the cores of minihalos such as mentioned above in ( i ) do not really matter . in contrast",
    ", if star formation efficiency in minihalos is not more than a factor of ten less efficient than in large halos , then pop iii stars in minihalos may be largely responsible for the first reionization . in either case",
    ", it seems likely that pop iii stars in minihalos make a large contribution to the first phase of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium approximately up to a level where the transition from pop iii stars to pop ii stars occurs .",
    "this apparent inevitability of twice reionizations is reached , based on a joint constraint by two observational facts : 1 ) the universe is required to be reionized at @xmath1 and 2 ) the density fluctuation in the universe at @xmath1 is well determined by the same small - scale power traced by the ly@xmath2 forest observed and well measured at @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the product of star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies at high redshift is well constrained , dictating the fate of the cosmological reionization process .",
    "the prolonged reionization and reheating history of the igm is more complicated than usually thought .",
    "because both cooling and recombination time scales are much shorter than the hubble time at the redshift in question , we devise a new , improved computational method to follow the evolution of the igm in all phases , including hii regions , hi regions and partially ionized regions .",
    "the overall reionization process may be separated into four joint stages .",
    "\\(1 ) from @xmath4 to @xmath0 , pop iii stars gradually heat up and ionize the igm and the first reionization occurs at the end of this stage , when the mean temperature of the igm reaches @xmath14k .",
    "\\(2 ) the first stage is followed by a brief period with a redshift interval of order @xmath5 , where the igm stays completely ionized due to sustained ionizing photon emission by forming pop iii stars . during this period , the temperature of the igm is maintained at @xmath14k .",
    "\\(3 ) the transition from pop iii stars to pop ii stars sets in at the beginning of this stage ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the abruptly reduced ( by a factor of @xmath7 ) ionizing photon emission rate causes hydrogen to rapidly recombine and the universe once again becomes opaque to ly@xmath2 and lyman continuum photons , marking the second cosmological recombination . from this time until @xmath8 compton cooling by the cosmic microwave background and photoheating by the stars",
    "self - regulate the jeans mass and the star formation rate .",
    "the mean temperature of the igm is maintained at @xmath9k from @xmath6 to @xmath8 . meanwhile , recombination and photoionization balance one another such that the igm stays largely ionized during this stage with @xmath10 .",
    "most of the star formation in this period occurs in large halos with dominant atomic line cooling .",
    "\\(4 ) at @xmath8 , the global star formation rate again surpasses the global recombination rate , resulting in the second reionization of the universe .",
    "the second reionization is predominantly due to stars formed in halos where atomic line cooling is efficient .",
    "there is a wide range of interesting implications from this new reionization picture presented here . to highlight a few :    @xmath442",
    "the pop iii stars enrich the igm with a metallicity of @xmath443 at @xmath444",
    ".    @xmath442 the magnetic field originating from massive stars could pollute the igm with a large - scale coherent field ( @xmath445kpc comoving ) of order @xmath446 g at @xmath444 .",
    "@xmath442 the number density of pop iii massive black holes ( @xmath447 ) is comparable to that of globular clusters and should seed later structure formation .",
    "@xmath442 direct detection of pop iii hypernovae / supernovae are very difficult but a systematic search for gravitational lensing magnified pop iii hypernovae / supernovae targeted at massive clusters of galaxies may turn out to be fruitful ; sirtf may be able to detect them .",
    "sirtf may also be able to detect some of the large pop iii galaxies .",
    "jwst should be able to detect both large pop iii galaxies and pop iii hypernovae .",
    "@xmath442 the thomson scattering optical depth is increased to @xmath11 ( compared to @xmath12 for the case of only one rapid reionization at @xmath8 ) , which will have significant implications on the polarization observations of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "upcoming map results should be able to distinguish between these two scenarios .",
    "@xmath442 under the present scenario it would not have been a surprise that no pop iii stars have been found in the local universe",
    ".    @xmath442 the igm , while opaque to ly@xmath2 photons , is highly ionized ( @xmath401 ) up to redshift @xmath408 .",
    "this may reconcile the observation indicating the second reionization at @xmath1 with the detection of ly@xmath2 galaxies at @xmath404 .",
    "@xmath442 finally , in contrast to the conventional reionization scenario , 21 cm lines prior to @xmath8 , which would otherwise be produced by minihalos in the absence of the first cosmological reionization , are predicted not to exist .",
    "this would provide a definitive test of the scenario .",

    "we determine the fraction of area in the background source plane at redshift @xmath335 , that is magnified by a factor of @xmath368 by foreground objects , primarily clusters of galaxies .",
    "the magnification regime in which we are interested is @xmath448 .",
    "we will first derive a general relationship between the magnification ( @xmath369 ) and source plane coordinate ( @xmath218 ) : @xmath449 for any singular density profile .",
    "then , we will use the singular isothermal sphere thanks to its ease of analytic treatment , which has the same @xmath450 relation , to model clusters of galaxies to compute the gravitational lensing cross section at the high @xmath369 end .",
    "the computed lensing cross section is cross - checked by observations to ensure consistency .",
    "we express the magnification @xmath369 as a function of @xmath218 , the source plane proper coordinate ( fig 13 ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath451 in the small @xmath218 , high @xmath369 limit , for both a point mass lens ( vietri & ostriker 1983 ) and a singular isothermal sphere lens ( sis ; turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) . for simplicity",
    "we will consider only axisymmetric lenses .",
    "we will generalize this property of @xmath369 in the small @xmath218 , high @xmath369 limit to any lens system as long as the lensing bending angle , @xmath452 , as a function of proper impact parameter , @xmath453 , does not increase as fast as @xmath453 .",
    "it is noted that @xmath454 for a uniform mass sheet , @xmath455constant for a sis , and @xmath456 for a point mass . from figure 15",
    "we can readily write down the lens equation as : @xmath457 the above equation relates the angular position of the image , @xmath458 , to the position of the source , @xmath196 ( both with respect to some reference direction ) through the bending angle , @xmath452 .",
    "@xmath459 , @xmath460 and @xmath461 are the angular diameter distance between the observer and the source , between the observer and the lens , and between the lens and the source , respectively .",
    "@xmath453 is the proper impact parameter relative to the lens center . expressing the bending angle @xmath452 as @xmath462 ( @xmath463 ) ,",
    "we can rewrite the above lens equation as : @xmath464 in the limit @xmath465 , the solution for the impact parameter is @xmath466^{1/(m-1)}$ ] ( einstein radius ) , and @xmath467 .",
    "it is noted that the requirement @xmath463 is to guarantee a solution , i.e. , the existence of an einstein radius .",
    "then , it is straightforward to show that , at small @xmath218 limit , the magnification is @xmath468 with the constant @xmath469 , independent of @xmath218 , being @xmath470 we note that , for any ( centrally ) singular density profile , @xmath471 is less than unity .",
    "it has been shown by syer & white ( 1996 ) and subramanian , cen , & ostriker ( 2000 ) that the density profile in the inner regions of dark matter halos , which are formed through hierarchical gravitational clustering / merging in the conventional gaussian structure formation models , is @xmath472 , where @xmath47 is the linear power spectrum index at the relevant scales .",
    "for the scales of interest , we have @xmath473 to @xmath89 for cold dark matter models , giving @xmath474 to @xmath475 .",
    "these inner slopes of halos were borne out in n - body simulations ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "thus , we should expect @xmath450 at small @xmath218 for halos formed in hierarchical structure formation models , including those of galaxy cluster size .",
    "moreover , cooling and subsequent condensation of baryons in the centers of halos may further steepen the density profiles in the inner regions .",
    "having deduced the universal @xmath450 relation at the small @xmath218 end , we will now carry out further calculations by adopting the sis model , because of its analytical simplicity and because of its astrophysical relevance as shown in many statistical studies ( gott & gunn 1974 ; tyson 1983 ; turner et al .",
    "1984 ; hinshaw & krauss 1987 ; narayan & white 1988 ; wu 1989 ; fukugita & turner 1991 ; mao 1991 ) .",
    "this is further justified if @xmath369 is normalized at a somewhat lower value , where some data from current observations exist .",
    "we note that , for individual multiply imaged observed quasars , it is clear that one needs to include ellipticities of the lenses for realistic modeling .",
    "for example , one can not produce quadruples with an axisymmetric lens ( narayan & grossman 1989 ; blandford et al .",
    ". however , for our purpose of calculating the magnification cross section at moderate - to - high range @xmath476 , the assumption of axisymmetry of lenses should be adequate . for a sis",
    "the bending angle , @xmath477 , conveniently independent of impact parameter , is ( turner et al .  1984 )",
    "@xmath478 where @xmath93 is the speed of light and @xmath479 is the line of sight velocity dispersion of the sis lens . with equation ( a5 )",
    "we can solve equation ( a2 ) with the following solution at the @xmath465 limit : @xmath480 and @xmath481 .",
    "inserting this solution into equation ( a3 ) yields the small @xmath218 limit of the @xmath482 relation for a sis lens : @xmath483 a sis would subtend a solid angle in the source plane @xmath484 within which the luminosity of a source is magnified by @xmath485 : @xmath486 .",
    "thus , the total probability of a _",
    "random _ source at @xmath335 of being magnified by @xmath485 can be obtained by adding up all the foreground lenses .",
    "this is done by integrating @xmath487 over lenses of all masses and over all redshifts up to the source redshift , @xmath335 , resulting in a double integral : @xmath488 where @xmath489 is the mass function of halos at redshift @xmath195 . to make the subsequent calculation more analytically tractable",
    ", we assume @xmath490 where @xmath491 \\exp(-m_a / m_*)~h^{3}\\hbox{mpc}^{-3}\\ ] ] is the differential cluster mass function at @xmath417 , taken from bahcall & cen ( 1993 ) .",
    "@xmath492 is the observed cluster mass within the abell radius ( @xmath493mpc ) and @xmath494m@xmath495 .",
    "the term @xmath496 is intended to approximately describe the evolution of the overall cluster mass function with redshift .",
    "the cluster mass , @xmath492 , defined within the abell radius , @xmath497 , may be related to @xmath479 for the sis model by @xmath498 where @xmath499 is the gravitational constant .",
    "combining equations ( a6 ) and ( a10 ) indicates that @xmath500 .",
    "it is instructive to examine the behavior of the following term , @xmath501 , which contains all the dependence of the integrand of the integral in equation ( a7 ) on @xmath492 . since @xmath502 is constant at the low @xmath492 end and @xmath503 at the high @xmath492 end , the integral over @xmath492 in equation ( a7 )",
    "is convergent on both ends and dominated by massive clusters near the exponential downturn at about @xmath504 .",
    "consequently , for our purpose , we need only to be accurate on the high mass end near the exponential downturn for @xmath505 and its redshift distribution characterized by parameter @xmath506 . substituting equations",
    "( a6 , a8 , a9 , a10 ) into equation ( a7 ) [ and making use of the simple relations in an @xmath507 universe : @xmath508 , @xmath509 , @xmath510 and @xmath511 yields @xmath512 all constants in equation ( a11 ) are in c.g.s . units , except @xmath513 , which is in mpc . note that we have also inserted a constant @xmath514 in equation ( a11 ) , which serves to absorb the uncertainties due to other factors which either can not be accurately treated here or are unknown , including background cosmology , deviations of density profiles from singular isothermal spheres , gravitational lensing due to other astronomical objects and uncertainties in the observed cluster mass function .",
    "the normalization of @xmath514 will be set by comparing to observations at @xmath515 . now expanding all the constants and integrating equation ( a11 ) with respect to @xmath349 ( @xmath516 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath517 where @xmath518 .",
    "the integral @xmath519 can be done analytically ( but the resultant expression is quite lengthy ) and here we just give the final numbers for specific @xmath335 and @xmath506 . for @xmath520 , @xmath521 , for @xmath522 , respectively .",
    "it shows that @xmath523 only weakly depends on @xmath506 , because the integral is dominated by the moderate redshift range @xmath524 .",
    "it is justified to only consider the large splitting events since the lensing cross section is dominated by massive clusters which give rise to large splittings ( @xmath525 ) . for the sake of concreteness",
    "we will adopt @xmath526 , which is consistent with the relatively wild evolution of cluster density up to redshift about unity ( e.g. , bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ) . as we will show below , the final results ( @xmath527 ) turn out to be extremely weakly dependent on @xmath506 .",
    "furthermore , we take @xmath528 to normalize @xmath523 : @xmath529 which gives @xmath530 .",
    "since we are integrating the observed clusters to obtain the lensing probability and the same clusters are also responsible for observed gravitational lensing events , we can make a consistency check .",
    "for the hewitt & burbidge ( 1989 ) quasar catalog of 4250 quasars there are two confirmed multiple image lens systems with splitting @xmath525 , which corresponds to multiple lensing probability of @xmath531(@xmath532 ) , i.e. , @xmath533 for @xmath515 ( in the singular isothermal sphere case ) .",
    "thus , our adopted normalization is consistent with the observed value of @xmath533 for @xmath515 .",
    "considering possible selection biases ( turner 1980 ; cen et al .",
    "1994a ; kochanek 1995 ) and the countervailing effect that the observed quasar sample is at significantly lower redshift than @xmath534 considered here , we argue that the adopted normalization is reasonable . from this",
    "we see that a _ random _ source at @xmath331 has a rather small probability of @xmath535 being very strongly lensed .",
    "we will now examine the case where we do not sample the sky randomly , rather observe a set of selected regions centered on massive clusters .",
    "the cross section for magnification @xmath485 in the source plane is @xmath536 , so the solid angle within which the sources will be magnified by @xmath485 is @xmath537 .",
    "integrating @xmath537 over a pre - selected set of clusters with mass @xmath538 in the redshift range @xmath539 to @xmath540 and dividing the integral by the number of clusters pre - selected gives the mean solid angle for source magnification @xmath485 .",
    "@xmath541 where @xmath542 is the total number of clusters selected ( a normalization factor ) . dividing the mean solid angle for source magnification @xmath485 by the field of view",
    "yields the mean probability of _ a source _ in such selected fields which will be magnified by @xmath485 : @xmath543 where @xmath544 is a telescope s field of view . as an example , let us take @xmath545 , @xmath546 and @xmath547 , which yields @xmath548 , for @xmath522 , respectively , in an @xmath507 , @xmath549km / s / mpc universe .",
    "similar to equation ( a11 ) , we can integrate equation ( a14 ) for @xmath550 , @xmath546 , @xmath547 and @xmath551 and the result is : @xmath552 .",
    "although an adjustment parameter @xmath553 in equation ( a14 ) , which is different from @xmath514 in equation ( a11 ) to reflect the fact that the uncertainties involved are somewhat different ( for example , since the probability is normalized per cluster , the uncertainty in the amplitude of the observed cluster mass function cancels out ) , for clarity and simplicity we adopt @xmath554 .",
    "the result indicates that @xmath555 is nearly independent of @xmath506 , unlike @xmath523 , which depends on @xmath506 , giving @xmath556 comparing @xmath527 with @xmath523 , for the case with @xmath526 , for example , we see that one gains a factor of @xmath557 in the cluster centered survey compared to a random survey , for a field of view of @xmath558  arcmin@xmath559 .",
    "the relative gain decreases with increasing size of the field of view , and the two probabilities become equal at @xmath560838  arcmin@xmath559 , above which the calculation of @xmath527 is no longer valid due to multiple clusters in a single field .",
    "note that , although the mean probability of a source within the field of view is inversely proportional to @xmath544 , the total number of magnified sources per field of view is @xmath561 ( where @xmath562 is the surface density of source @xmath563 , which is either @xmath564 or @xmath565 in this study ) , which is independent of @xmath544 .",
    "the physical reason for having a relative increase in the probability of magnified sources is that the clusters of galaxies are rare targets and hence a _ random _ field of view has a small probability of intersecting a cluster .",
    "we note that @xmath523 is still valid even in the case of multiple clusters in a single field .",
    "however , the calculation of @xmath523 breaks down when multiple clusters are _ precisely _ aligned along the line of sight .",
    "but such cases are likely to be negligibly few .",
    "we further note that the spatial clustering of galaxy clusters would further boost the gain of @xmath527 over @xmath523 , but we will not consider this effect here ."

    "<S> these two observations most importantly fix the product of star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the only major assumption made is that the initial mass function of metal - free , population iii stars is top - heavy .    to the extent that the relative star formation efficiencies in gaseous minihalos with 2 cooling and large halos with atomic cooling at high redshift are unknown , </S>",
    "<S> the primary source for the first reionization is still uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> if star formation efficiency in minihalos is at least 10% of that in large halos , then pop iii stars in the minihalos may be largely responsible for the first reionization ; otherwise , the first reionization will be attributable largely to pop iii stars in large halos . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> 2 cooling in minihalos is necessarily efficient . </S>",
    "<S> we show that gas in minihalos can be cooled efficiently by 2 molecules and star formation can continue to take place largely unimpeded throughout the first reionization period , as long as gas is able to accumulate in them . </S>",
    "<S> this comes about thanks to two new mechanisms for generating a high x - ray background during the pop iii era , put forth here , namely , x - ray emission from the cooling energy of pop iii supernova blast waves and from miniquasars powered by pop iii black holes . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , 2 formation in the cores of minihalos is significantly induced to be able to counteract the destruction by lyman - werner photons produced by the same pop iii stars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an important process for producing a large number of 2 molecules in relic hii regions of pop iii galaxies , first pointed out by ricotti , gnedin , & shull , is quantified here . </S>",

    "<S> from @xmath4 pop iii stars gradually heat up and ionize the intergalactic medium , completing the first reionization at @xmath0 , followed by a brief period of @xmath5 , during which the intergalactic medium stays completely ionized due to sustained ionizing photon emission from concomitant pop iii galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from pop iii stars to pop ii stars at @xmath6 suddenly reduces , by a factor of @xmath7 , ionizing photon emission rate , causing hydrogen to rapidly recombine , marking the second cosmological recombination . from @xmath6 to @xmath8 , compton cooling by the cosmic microwave background and photoheating by the stars self - regulate the jeans mass and the star formation rate , giving rise to a mean temperature of the intergalactic medium maintained nearly at constant of @xmath9k . meanwhile , recombination and photoionization balance one another such that the intergalactic medium stays largely ionized during this stage with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the star formation in this period occurs in large halos with dominant atomic line cooling .    </S>",
