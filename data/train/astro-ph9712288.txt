    "the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  4151 has been a favorite of observers wishing to use variability as a probe of the inner workings of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "ngc  4151 s ultraviolet variability was first noted in a rocket flight ( @xcite ) .",
    "numerous campaigns using the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) have since monitored the continuum , emission lines and absorption lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "iue studies of the absorption lines ( @xcite ) noted a tendency for the equivalent widths of the high ionization lines ( e.g. , ) to correlate directly with variations in the continuum while low ionization lines such as were anticorrelated .",
    "in contrast , monitoring of the absorption line a decade later using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) at moderate spectral resolution ( r@xmath015,000 ) showed no variation in strength or shape over a baseline of several years ( @xcite ) .",
    "significant uv continuum and emission - line variability on timescales as short as 12 days were seen in the continuous monitoring of ngc  4151 with iue in 1994 december ( @xcite ) .",
    "monitoring with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) during the astro-2 mission over the 9121820   band at @xmath12-day intervals showed no change in the equivalent width , but revealed substantial variations in the column and in low - ionization ions such as and that were correlated with variations in the continuum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . with the low resolution ( r@xmath0300 )",
    "hut data , however , we could not identify which of the several components in the complex absorption profile was associated with these variations .    the hut astro-1 and astro-2 observations of ngc  4151 revealed numerous absorption lines over a wide range of ionization states in the 9121200    band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . our observations with the berkeley spectrometer on orfeus - spas  ii were intended to make use of its higher resolution ( r@xmath03300 ) relative to hut to study the structure and time response of the absorption line systems in greater detail .",
    "we present here the mean spectrum and key features of the variability we saw during the orfeus - spas  ii mission .",
    "full details of the individual observations will be described in a subsequent publication .",
    "we obtained spectra of ngc  4151 at eleven epochs with the berkeley spectrograph during the orfeus - spas  ii mission in 1996 november / december .",
    "exposure times ranged from 600 to 2200 s , with a total exposure of 15,658 s. the general design of the berkeley spectrograph is discussed by hurwitz & bowyer ( 1986 , 1996 ) , while calibration and performance for the orfeus - spas  ii mission are described by hurwitz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the berkeley spectrometer has a 2-d detector , so the ngc  4151 data were obtained through a 26  diameter aperture simultaneously with airglow spectra through a larger aperture offset by 2.4 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio varies greatly with wavelength , and it is highest near the and ly@xmath13  emission lines . due to a reflection in the berkeley spectrometer ,",
    "undispersed ly@xmath13 airglow produces a rapid increase in the background level below @xmath0950  .",
    "correction for this and other instrumental features are discussed in hurwitz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and our data were extracted and calibrated using the prescription recommended by the berkeley spectrometer team .    to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , we binned these basic spectra into larger wavelength bins of 0.15  , roughly half a resolution element ( @xcite ) . to correct the wavelength scale for slight inaccuracies in telescope pointing",
    ", we shifted the object spectra to place the galactic @xmath14 and @xmath15 absorption features at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath16 ( the galactic velocity determined by @xcite ) . from a comparison among all the observed galactic absorption features in the spectrum",
    ", we estimate that our wavelength scale is accurate to @xmath17 ( 1@xmath18 ) .",
    "the contemporaneous airglow spectra were extracted in exactly the same manner as the target data .",
    "airglow emission lines were fitted using gaussian components .",
    "comparison of the line widths of isolated emission lines through both the airglow aperture and the smaller target aperture provided the correction factor needed to generate a model airglow spectrum tailored to each target spectrum .",
    "our template airglow spectra were then corrected for slight wavelength offsets and scaled to match the flux observed through the target aperture by linear shifting and scaling to the ly@xmath19  line in the object spectrum .",
    "the mean airglow - subtracted , exposure - weighted spectrum is shown in figure 1 .    to 12pt",
    "the mean spectrum shows that ngc  4151 had an intensity intermediate between the observations made during the astro-1 and astro-2 missions .",
    "we use the mean spectrum to determine the basic parameters of both continuum and line components ( see tables 1 and 2 ) . these and subsequent fits were performed using @xmath20 minimization in the spectral fitting program specfit ( @xcite ) .",
    "we model the continuum as a power law in @xmath21 .",
    "we correct for foreground extinction using a clayton , cardelli , & mathis ( 1989 ) curve assuming @xmath22 ( @xcite ) and @xmath23 .    the best - fit , extinction - corrected continuum is @xmath24 . for the ly@xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath25 emission lines we assume the shape found by kriss et al .",
    "absorption features were modeled using components that are either gaussians in equivalent width or optical depth .",
    "the features identified in the mean spectrum and their parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "we find no evidence for a change in power - law index among the individual observations .",
    "to fit the variations in the individual emission and absorption lines , we fix the wavelength and line width of each component and fit the intensity or equivalent width in every individual exposure .",
    "measuring the intrinsic neutral hydrogen column in ngc  4151 requires good s / n in the high - order lyman lines since the low - order lines are heavily saturated .",
    "a s / n of @xmath26 per bin at the lyman limit required further binning of the the mean spectrum to 0.6   pixel@xmath27 .",
    "this is still far better than the @xmath03   resolution of hut .",
    "unfortunately , the high background    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we similarly determined the location and line width of two narrow low - ionization components seen in ghrs spectra ( components a and f ) which are identified with outflowing and halo material in ngc  4151 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fit these components in the mean spectrum and included a broad component to represent higher ionization material ( an unresolved blend of components c , d and e ) .",
    "the several components and their best fit parameters are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the reduced @xmath20  of the fit is quite large ( 187.6 ) , but this is largely due to an underestimate of the true errors in the binned data . near in the re - binned spectrum",
    "the formal s / n based on photon statistics is @xmath085 , but the flat field is only accurate to @xmath26% .",
    "our best fit to the broad absorption gives @xmath28  and @xmath29 covering @xmath30% of the source .",
    "this broad component is consistent with that seen in the hut astro-1 and astro-2 spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has a width and partial covering similar to that seen during astro-2 , and a total column intermediate between the astro-1 and astro-2 values , consistent with the intermediate value of the continuum flux seen in these new observations .",
    "component ` f ' , at the systemic velocity of ngc  4151 and probably associated with its ism or halo , has a column density an order of magnitude lower than the optically thick component suggested by kriss et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but it is still optically thick . given the lack of broad , black absorption at this velocity in the ghrs spectrum ( @xcite ) , it is likely that the actual column density is at the lower end of the range permitted by our errors .      correcting for the @xmath31 resolution of the berkeley spectrometer",
    ", the unresolved galactic absorption features have fwhm @xmath32 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this is roughly what is expected from the 21-cm profile towards ngc  4151 ( @xcite ) , and is consistent with galactic lines in the ghrs spectra .",
    "our identified galactic absorption lines are similar to those reported for the 3c  273 sight line by hurwitz et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "accurate measurements of absorption intrinsic to ngc  4151 proved difficult due to the overlapping absorption and emission features .",
    "what is apparent , however , is that the dominant absorption in the doublet is similar to the absorption features seen in the line ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is optically thick , but the broad width ( @xmath33 ) and the non - black line centers imply partial covering . we see no significant variations in the absorption equivalent width .",
    "more detailed analysis of the troughs will be reported in a future publication .    as described by bromage et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and kriss et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , @xmath6  @xmath341176 can be used together with @xmath34977 to measure the density of the absorbing gas . in the astro-1 and astro-2 hut data ,",
    "both lines were assumed to arise in the same absorbing region .",
    "the higher resolution orfeus - spas  ii data shows that the situation is not so simple the mean velocity of the @xmath6  @xmath341176 absorption is significantly higher than that of @xmath34977 .",
    "@xmath34977 is less blueshifted , and it has a velocity comparable to that of component d in the profile of weymann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . @xmath6",
    "@xmath341176 is closer in velocity to component c , but the 850 @xmath35 width of the feature gives considerable overlap to all broad components c , d , and e. if the gas outflowing from ngc  4151 is accelerating , this places the highest density gas in the outflow farthest from the source .",
    "in contrast to the results for ly@xmath19  and absorption , we detect strong variations in the @xmath6  @xmath341176 and @xmath341073 absorption lines .",
    "( @xmath341062 is blended with galactic absorption . )",
    "the constancy of the galactic features throughout the mission confirms the reality of these variations .",
    "as shown in figure [ n4151f2.eps ] , both @xmath6  and anti - correlate with the observed continuum variations . to within the 12 day sampling of our measurements , the continuum and line variations are instantaneous with no significant lag .    following the formalism of krolik & kriss ( 1997 ) , we can use the ionization and recombination timescales to set limits on the location of the absorbing material .",
    "for an observed ionization timescale @xmath36 , an ionizing flux density at the earth @xmath37 , a mean photoionization cross section @xmath38 , an ionization energy @xmath39 , and a distance to the source @xmath40 ( 15 mpc for ngc  4151 ) , they find that the material must lie at a radius @xmath41 the decrease in the @xmath42 equivalent width during the increase in the continuum flux observed from day 334 to 335 implies that ionization is dominating in this interval .",
    "we thus have an upper limit of 1 day on @xmath36 . using a photoionization cross section of @xmath43 ( @xcite ) at the ionization threshold for @xmath6  ( 41.4 ev , or 300  ) , and extrapolating our best - fit , extinction corrected continuum to 300  , we find @xmath44 pc .",
    "this is comparable to the limit found using the variation in the column seen during the hut astro-2 observations of ngc  4151 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant emission features in our data are @xmath341034 , @xmath341085 , and the blue wing of ly@xmath13 . the partial ly@xmath13  line and the strength of the ly@xmath13  airglow preclude any meaningful determination of the intrinsic line strength .",
    "variations in the and fluxes compared to the continuum are shown in figure [ n4151f2.eps ] .",
    "the fractional variation in the flux ( @xmath45 ) is comparable to that in the continuum flux ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "in contrast , the variation seen in the emission is much less : @xmath47 .",
    "our data set is not large enough to compute meaningful cross correlation functions , but qualitatively one can see that there is significant response in the emission lines on timescales of 2 days or less .",
    "the detailed response , however , is not the typical smeared and delayed variation seen in prior monitoring campaigns . while the continuum is rising in the first three observations , and are constant or falling in flux .",
    "in contrast , both lines track well the dip and subsequent rise in continuum flux at days 334 to 336 .",
    "we thank the berkeley spectrometer science team and all those whose participation helped make the orfeus - spas  ii mission such a success .",
