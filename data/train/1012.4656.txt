    "simple inflationary models can be broadly but conveniently classified into three main categories , see e.g.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "one category comprises hybrid inflation models  @xcite , where the inflaton is responsible for the slow - roll dynamics while another scalar field is responsible for the end of inflation .",
    "interesting aspects of these models include the possible production of topological defects at the end of inflation and possible realisations in supergravity as f - term or d - term inflation  @xcite and in string theory in the framework of brane inflation  @xcite .",
    "another category comprising chaotic inflation  @xcite includes the large field inflation models .",
    "they have the simplest field theoretic origin as a single massive scalar field is enough to generate inflation .",
    "another relevant feature of these models is the large , super - planckian value of the inflaton and therefore the possibility to generate a significant amount of primordial gravity waves during inflation .",
    "unfortunately , such large values of the inflaton may render these models more difficult to realize in supergravity or string theory . in this respect , the category of small field or hilltop inflation models  @xcite , which includes for instance the original new inflation model  @xcite ,",
    "may be more natural . in these models , inflation occurs near a maximum or an inflection point of the potential , where the curvature is negative .",
    "this makes the slow - roll conditions somewhat easier to achieve and leads to cosmological perturbations with a negative spectral index as favoured by observations .",
    "another interesting aspect of these models is that inflation can occur at very low energy scales , while still generating an acceptable spectrum of primordial density perturbations  @xcite .",
    "these models offer also string theoretic realisations , for instance in the form of racetrack models  @xcite where the imaginary part of a khler modulus acts as the inflaton . another consequence of small field inflation follows from the lyth bound on the inflaton excursion  @xcite , which implies that gravitational waves generated during inflation are highly suppressed in this setting .    at the end of inflation ,",
    "the inflaton condensate must decay and reheat the universe .",
    "it has become clear during the last twenty years or so  @xcite that , in most models , reheating starts with an explosive and non - perturbative production of large , non - thermal fluctuations of the inflaton and other bosonic fields coupled to it , in the process of preheating  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent dynamics are characterized by a highly non - linear and turbulent - like evolution , before the system eventually settles into thermal equilibrium",
    ". preheating may have many interesting consequences in cosmology , like the production of stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves  @xcite , primordial black holes  @xcite , non - gaussian curvature perturbations  @xcite or primordial magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "preheating after chaotic and hybrid inflation has been abundantly studied in the literature , both analytically and with numerical lattice simulations  @xcite . in models of chaotic inflation , preheating occurs typically via broad parametric resonance  @xcite , where fields coupled to the inflaton are produced non - adiabatically as the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of its potential , or via tachyonic resonance  @xcite in the presence of trilinear or non - renormalizable bosonic interactions for the inflaton . in models of hybrid inflation , field fluctuations",
    "are amplified by a tachyonic ( spinodal ) instability  @xcite as the fields roll towards the true minimum of the potential at the end of inflation .    by contrast , preheating after small field inflation remains less explored .",
    "on the analytical side , the problem is complicated by the fact that closed - form solutions for the evolution of the homogeneous background during preheating are in general not available , while standard approximations like wkb for the evolution of the perturbations are not applicable in this context . on the numerical side , lattice simulations of preheating in these models",
    "must cover scales that range from the hubble rate at the end of inflation up to the inflaton mass at the minimum of the potential , which typically differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "preheating after new inflation was studied in @xcite , where it was described as a combination of both tachyonic amplification and non - adiabatic resonance . in this sense",
    ", it is somehow intermediate between preheating after chaotic inflation and preheating after hybrid inflation .",
    "some aspects of preheating in this model where also studied numerically in @xcite and in the context of khler moduli / roulette inflation in @xcite .",
    "the combination of tachyonic and non - adiabatic effects occurs also in preheating via trilinear or non - renormalizable interactions after chaotic inflation  @xcite .",
    "however , we will see that preheating after small field inflation occurs in a qualitatively different way .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to develop the analytical understanding of preheating in the class of small field inflation models .",
    "this is a first necessary step before a further study of the dynamics with lattice simulations and of the cosmological consequences of preheating in these models . to illustrate some of the qualitative features of preheating after small field inflation ,",
    "consider the inflaton potential shown in fig .",
    "[ smallpot ] .",
    "slow - roll inflation ends when the second slow - roll parameter @xmath0 becomes of order one , where the curvature of the potential is negative and of the order of the hubble rate squared .",
    "the inflaton then rolls down the potential , passes through an inflection point where the curvature vanishes and oscillates around the minimum with an amplitude controlled by hubble friction . before the inflaton reaches the inflection point ,",
    "its fluctuations have a negative effective mass squared and modes with momentum @xmath2 are amplified by a tachyonic instability .",
    "this process may affect a very wide range of scales , from the hubble rate at the end of inflation up to the maximum of @xmath3 , but it is much more efficient for the low - momentum modes .",
    "the tachyonic amplification stops when the inflaton crosses the inflexion point of the potential , oscillates around the minimum and goes back towards the tachyonic region . during this interval of time",
    ", the mass of the inflaton varies very non - adiabatically with time .",
    "this can lead to a further growth of the perturbations , but we will see that this effect is typically negligible . however , the evolution of the modes during this time interval when the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of the potential has dramatic consequences for the fate of the fluctuations when the inflaton goes back into the region where the curvature is negative . indeed , during this second tachyonic episode , the amplitude of the fluctuations starts to decrease exponentially with time . for the modes with sufficiently low momenta ,",
    "this exponential decrease occurs during the amount of time the inflaton condensate climbs back along its potential . if the inflaton climbed back up to the point from where it started , this effect would exactly compensate the growth of these modes during the first tachyonic episode .",
    "by contrast , the modes with higher momentum , which were amplified at a slower rate during the first tachyonic episode , continue to be amplified during the second one .",
    "the whole process may then repeat itself several times as the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of the potential .",
    "the net effect then follows from a competition between low - momentum modes which grow a lot but also decrease a lot and modes with higher momenta which grow less but also decrease less .",
    "as we will see , the analytical description of this process is very similar to the problem of tunneling through a volcano - shaped potential ( two potential barriers separated by a deep potential well ) in quantum mechanics .",
    "alternatively , the initial tachyonic growth may be so efficient that preheating ends during the first tachyonic episode , depending on the parameters .",
    "as we will see , another specificity of small field models is that the spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations amplified at the beginning of preheating is peaked around the hubble rate , because the modes with @xmath4 are amplified from the beginning of preheating when @xmath5 while the modes with higher momenta are amplified only later and at a slower rate .",
    "the situation is different for preheating after chaotic inflation , where the fluctuations amplified by parametric resonance are typically peaked at scales @xmath6 with the initial resonance parameter @xmath7 for preheating to be efficient  @xcite .",
    "similarly , for preheating after hybrid inflation , the typical scale of the fluctuations amplified by the tachyonic instability is set by the curvature of the potential in the direction of the symmetry - breaking field and must be sub - hubble to satisfy the so - called waterfall condition  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in models of small field inflation , the modes amplified by the initial tachyonic instability leave the hubble radius , because preheating starts when the the second slow - roll parameter @xmath0 becomes of order unity while the first slow - roll parameter @xmath1 is still much smaller than one , so that the universe is still inflating at the beginning of preheating .",
    "when preheating ends in less than one oscillation of the inflaton condensate , large density perturbations of the hubble size may lead to an abundant production of primordial black holes , see also  @xcite , which may put strong constraints on models of small field inflation .",
    "this is in contrast with preheating after chaotic and hybrid inflation , where the field inhomogeneities are peaked at scales that are much shorter than the hubble radius  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , large field fluctuations at the hubble scale and the fact that small field inflation can occur at very low energy scales may lead to the production of gravitational waves from preheating with frequencies today that are sufficiently small to fall into the range accessible by high - sensitivity ground - based and even space - based interferometric experiments  @xcite . a detailed study of these cosmological consequences of preheating after small field inflation will appear elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secback ] , we specify the models of small field inflation that we will consider and we describe the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent evolution of the inflaton condensate . section [ sec1 ] is dedicated to the first stage of preheating , when the inflaton condensate first rolls towards the minimum of the potential . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we study the second stage of preheating , when the inflaton condensate oscillates around the minimum .",
    "some of the results used in that section are derived in the appendix . in section  [ secpert ] ,",
    "we first consider other possible non - perturbative decay channels for the condensate .",
    "we then discuss the perturbative decay of the inflaton after preheating and the resulting reheat temperature .",
    "finally , section [ secconclu ] contains a summary of our results and directions for future work .",
    "we consider small field inflation models with a single inflaton field @xmath8 .",
    "inflation occurs near a maximum or an inflection point of the potential , which can be chosen as the origin @xmath9 .",
    "denoting by @xmath10 the energy scale during inflation , the potential can be parametrized as [ pot ] v ( ) = m^4where @xmath11 . restricting to positive values of @xmath8",
    ", inflation occurs as the inflaton grows away from the origin .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the minimum of the potential where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the higher order derivatives of @xmath16 at @xmath17 are usually of order one . in small field models",
    ", inflation occurs when @xmath18  , inflation may end when the inflaton is relatively close to the minimum of the potential @xmath19 .",
    "this occurs for instance in modular inflation  @xcite and natural inflation  @xcite .",
    "these models belong also to the hilltop category but they are not small - field models ( the inflaton takes instead planckian values ) and we do not consider them here .",
    "preheating in these models is more similar to preheating after chaotic inflation  @xcite . ] .",
    "the inflationary potential may then be expanded into a power series around the origin as [ potor ] f ( ) = ( ) ^p + ... 0 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the absence of the @xmath22 term in ( [ potor ] ) may follow naturally from the fact that @xmath9 could be a fixed point of some internal symmetries , but this is not always the case .",
    "the location of any fixed point of internal symmetries is not important for the inflationary dynamics but it has crucial consequences for reheating , as we will see in section  [ secpert ] .",
    "the original new inflation model @xcite is well described by the potential ( [ pot ] , [ potor ] ) with @xmath23 ( up to logarithmic corrections ) and @xmath9 a fixed point of internal symmetries . in the original scenario , the inflaton was supposed to be a higgs field in grand unified theories with @xmath24 gev , but this is not necessary .",
    "another example is provided by the model of mssm inflation of @xcite , where the inflaton corresponds to a flat direction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "this model is well described by the potential ( [ pot ] , [ potor ] ) with @xmath25 and @xmath26 a fixed point of internal symmetries   at the minimum of the potential . ] , where @xmath27 is related to the cutoff scale @xmath28 and to the soft susy breaking scale @xmath29 tev .",
    "the details of preheating will of course depend on the explicit expression of the function @xmath30 and in particular on the form of the potential around its minimum . however , in this section , we will first review the inflationary dynamics , in order to determine the initial conditions for preheating and the constraint to impose on @xmath10 and @xmath31 from the normalization of the cmb fluctuations . for this , it is sufficient to consider the form ( [ pot ] , [ potor ] ) of the potential in the vicinity of @xmath9",
    ". let us first suppose that a single power of the inflaton @xmath32 in ( [ potor ] ) dominates the potential throughout inflation .",
    "the slow - roll parameters then read [ epsilon ] & & ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2(p-1 ) + [ eta ] & & ^2 ( ) -(p-1)()^p-2 where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath33 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "it follows that @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 during slow - roll ( @xmath36 ) for small field models ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the slow - roll phase then ends when @xmath38 , while inflation continues afterwards until @xmath39 . since @xmath0 must increase with @xmath8 for the slow - roll phase to end , eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) implies that the inflaton potential must be dominated by a power @xmath32 with @xmath40 at the end of slow - roll .",
    "this does not forbid the presence of terms with smaller powers of the inflaton in the potential ( [ pot],[potor ] ) during inflation , but these terms must be subdominant at the end of slow - roll . in particular , a mass term @xmath41 is usually present in the potential when the model is embedded into supergravity and its coefficient must be somewhat smaller than its generic value in order to have @xmath36 during inflation , the so - called @xmath42-problem  -problem in the context of small - field inflation is discussed in e.g.  @xcite . ] .",
    "it is possible that a mass term @xmath41 dominates the potential when cosmological scales leave the hubble radius while a higher order term dominates at the end of inflation .",
    "however , it turns out that the constraint on @xmath10 and @xmath31 that follows from the normalization of cmb fluctuations in this case is practically the same as the one obtained when a single power @xmath32 with @xmath40 dominates the potential throughout inflation , eq .",

    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider a single power of the inflaton @xmath32 with @xmath40 in the potential ( [ pot],[potor ] ) in order to determine both the initial conditions for preheating and the constraint to impose on @xmath10 and @xmath31 in order to obtain an acceptable spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "preheating will start at the end of the slow - roll phase , i.e. when @xmath43 but @xmath44 , because the potential term then starts to dominate in the equation of motion of the inflaton fluctuations , see the following section .",

    "we showed that preheating after small field inflation is usually dominated by the tachyonic amplification of inflaton fluctuations in the intervals of time when the inflaton condensate rolls in the region where the curvature of its potential is negative .",
    "a peculiar feature of this process is that the inflaton fluctuations experience a succession of exponential growths and decreases , so we called it `` tachyonic oscillation '' .",
    "the exponential decreases of the fluctuations in these intervals of time arise because the coefficient of the decreasing mode is much larger than the coefficient of the growing mode , by an amount that depends on the scale of the fluctuation . despite this temporary exponential decrease of the fluctuations ,",
    "the full process is very efficient and we showed that preheating completes typically after less than five oscillations of the inflaton condensate .",
    "the range of scales of the fluctuations amplified in the course of preheating is very wide , extending from the hubble scale to the curvature of the potential at the minimum , with a peak given by eq .",
    "( [ peakp2 ] ) when preheating completes in more than one oscillation of the condensate .",
    "when the condition ( [ cond1v ] ) is satisfied , the first tachyonic instability is so efficient that preheating completes in less than one oscillation of the condensate . in that case , the spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations at the end of preheating is peaked around the hubble scale , or even slightly outside the hubble radius because of the residual amount of inflation during preheating .",
    "density fluctuations at the hubble scale may then lead to an abundant production of primordial black holes , see also  @xcite , which can put constraints on small field inflation models , see e.g.  @xcite for a recent update on observational constraints on primodrial black holes .",
    "the large field fluctuations amplified by preheating lead also to the production of gravitational waves ( gw ) , with a peak frequency today  @xcite [ fstargw ] f _ * ( ) ( ) 10 ^ 3 where @xmath530 and @xmath531 are the hubble rate and the energy density during preheating , and @xmath532 is the charactersitic momentum amplified by preheating  ) is valid when the universe becomes quickly radiation - dominated after preheating .",
    "note also that , in models where gauge fields play an important role in the dynamics of preheating , extra peaks may appear at well - distinct frequencies in the final gw spectrum  @xcite . ] .",
    "gw from preheating after chaotic and hybrid inflation tend to have a frequency today above @xmath533 hz , which is too high to be observable by high - sensitivity interferometric experiments , either because @xmath534 gev or because @xmath535  @xcite .",
    "gw from the non - perturbative decay of condensates different from the inflaton , in particular super - symmetric flat directions , are more promising in this respect although the gw amplitude may be suppressed in that cases  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gw from preheating after small field inflation may fall naturally in the frequency range accessible by ground - based and even space - based interferometers when @xmath536 and the energy scale of inflation is small enough , which is common in this class of models .",
    "we also saw that preheating after small field inflation may be followed by a long matter - dominated stage before the universe thermalizes , which would further redshift and dilute these gw . a detailed study of the production of primordial black holes and gw from preheating after small field inflation is currently under way  @xcite .    finally , although an analytical understanding of the linear stage of preheating is often very useful to study its cosmological consequences , lattice simulations are eventually necessary to further study the non - linear dynamics .",
    "this is a difficult task in general for preheating after small field inflation , because of the wide range of scales that appear in the problem . in such cases ,",
    "lattice simulations can be performed only for a limited range of parameters and the analytical results that we derived in this paper may be used to extrapolate the results to other regions of the parameter space .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank maxim khlopov , david langlois and jihad mourad for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we solve the mode equation ( [ modeq ] ) in the interval @xmath240 $ ] and we match the solution to the wkb solutions ( [ alpha]-[abar ] ) . as discussed in section  [ sec2 ] , we do this by looking for an approximate schrdinger potential for which we can find exact analytical solutions .    in order to find guidance on the form of a suitable schrdinger potential ,",
    "let us first consider the mode equation ( [ modeq ] ) in the model ( [ potp ] ) with @xmath252  . as discussed in section  [ secback",
    "] , this model in itself does not lead to small field inflation .",
    "however , in that case , the background evolution of the inflaton condensate can be solved analytically , and we can then find the analytical expression of the schrdinger potential appearing in the mode equation .",
    "thus we start by considering the rescaled inflaton potential = ( 1 - ^2)^2 instead of ( [ vtilde ] ) .",
    "the conservation of energy analogous to ( [ etilde ] ) then gives ^2 = when @xmath537 .",
    "this can be integrated to give @xmath538 where , as in section [ sec2 ] , we normalize the time coordinate such that @xmath192 when @xmath8 is maximal .",
    "the effective schrdinger potential in the mode equation then reads -((t ) ) = 1 - which corresponds to ( [ upot ] ) for @xmath539 , @xmath540 and @xmath541 .",
    "note that the relation ( [ mumag ] ) is satisfied for these values of the parameters .",
    "exact analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation with this potential are known , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this potential provides also a very good approximation to @xmath249 in the interval @xmath240 $ ] for the model ( [ potp4 ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ uapp ] . in this approximation ,",
    "the mode equation ( [ modeq ] ) reads [ shrou ] _ k + ( k^2 - k_^2 + ) v_k = 0  .",
    "it is convenient to define the parameter [ nu ] = and to make the change of variable x =  .",
    "note that @xmath542 is real for @xmath543 and pure imaginary otherwise . in terms of the function @xmath544 , eq .",

    "the inflaton condensate reaches its maximal value and @xmath122 changes sign , so that ( [ hyper ] ) for @xmath270 should be an odd function of @xmath76 , i.e. it should be anti - symmetric around @xmath548 .",

    "symmetric around @xmath548 , @xmath550 must reduce to a first - order polynomial , which requires @xmath551 or @xmath552 for @xmath270 .",
    "only the second condition is possible and , using ( [ nu ] , [ b ] ) for @xmath270 , this gives [ bem1 ] + - = -1 which is equivalent to eq .",

    "the numerical value is @xmath553 .",
