    "rna polymerases move along dna templates and synthesizing pre - mrna by reading their information .",
    "this model is applicable only to the dynamics of prokaryotic cells because of its simplicity . that of eukaryotic cell is more complicated due to several factors . for example , dna of prokaryotic cell consists not only exon but also intron @xcite and the pre - mrna synthesized in intron degrades when rnapii reaches exon @xcite .",
    "it is also observed that some sites of dna can be modified by proteins and these modifications regulate transcriptional dynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rnapiis in eukaryotic cell interact with each other cooperatively .",
    "transcription factory @xcite is the model describing such behavior , where rnapiis cluster for efficiency of transcription @xcite .",
    "the traffic flow models are the system consisting on self - driven particles which interact with each other by excluded volume effect and applied to analyze not only vehicular traffic but also several fields including life sciences .",

    "ultradiscretization @xcite , this model is related to the burgers equation , which is one of differential equation model .    such discovery of transcription dynamics , development of traffic flow models and finer data of the dynamics of polymerase by virtue of the recent progress of the measurement technology yield several transcription models based on traffic flow models .",
    "tripathi et al .",
    "suggested the model where rnapii take several states and interact each other and discussed that their mean velocity and density @xcite .",
    "ohta et al . suggested the traffic model of rnapii with blockades which are regarded as the protein modification and discussed the response of rnapii after stimulation and its time intervals @xcite .",
    "a recent experiment indicates that there are several gaps in the distribution of the position of rnapii @xcite , which can not be explained by the existing traffic flow models . to understand such a phenomenon , ohta et al .",
    "proposed the path - preference model @xcite , which accepts rnapii near the dna loop formation in the end of an exon to jump onto the top of the next exon .",
    "such jumps are interpreted as three dimensional diffusion due to concentration of rnapii in transcription .",
    "it is known that the numerical simulation for this model in deterministic case shows several discontinuous gaps in the flow @xcite . by analyzing orbits of the system in some special cases",
    ", we discover the reason why such gaps appear . in this paper , we discuss mathematical properties of the path - preference model including these gaps . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the path - preference model . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the mathematical properties in the simplest case of the path - preference model , which is corresponding to deterministic 1-exon and 1-intron one .",
    "finally , we numerically discuss extensions of this model by introducing stochastic factor or considering more complex structure .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the path - preference cellular automaton model .",
    "this system consists on a sequence of sites and several particles and each site can contain at most one particle .",
    "the sites are divided into two classes , @xmath0-part and @xmath1-part , and we assume that the first site belongs to @xmath0-part and the last one to @xmath1-part ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - prig - state ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of the system is completed when all particles have moved by the following rules .",
    "particles translate rightward in this picture . ]    except some special sites described later , a particle moves to the next site if there are no particles or stalls if there is .",
    "this rule is the same as the local update of the eca rule 184 and means the excluded volume interaction of particles .",
    "we define that a particle which is on the end of the last @xmath1-part goes back the top of the first @xmath0-part , i.e. , this system is periodic .",
    "the difference from the standard traffic flow cellular automaton model is that the particle on the end of an @xmath0-part stochastically jumps to the top of the next @xmath0-part .",
    "the destination of the jump on the last @xmath0-part is the top of the first one due to the periodicity . in traffic flow models ,",
    "this jump means the shortcut between these sites .    in the paper @xcite , _ sites _ , _ sequences of sites _ , @xmath2- , @xmath3_-part _ and _ particles _",
    "are expressed as bases , dna , exon , intron and rnapii , respectively , the orientation of the transition is that of transcription and the periodical boundary condition means that rnapii which has finished its transcription on a dna immediately starts again that on the next dna .",
    "however , this model can be also applied to the dynamics of rnapii which travels between gene area and non - gene area in a single exon .    in this model",
    ", the particle on the end of an @xmath0-part can jump to the top of the next one and that on the end of the previous @xmath1-part also can move there .",
    "then , we should determine priority for these two actions to avoid collision .",
    "in this paper , we give the priority to jumping particles because of a mathematical reason described in later , i.e. , if there is a particle jumping to an @xmath0-part , no particles can move there from the previous @xmath1-part ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ex2 ] and [ fig - ex3 ] ) .        [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      based on the modeling above ,",
    "we now write down the mathematical formulation of this model .",
    "we denotes @xmath4 as the number of sites and each site is labeled as @xmath5 , ",
    ", @xmath4 in series .",
    "let @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) be the number of particles at the site @xmath9 and time @xmath10 ( and set @xmath4 sufficiently large for consistency of the definition below ) .",
    "the system contains @xmath11(@xmath12 ) @xmath0- and @xmath1-parts and the number @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) satisfying @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the last site of @xmath18-th @xmath0- and @xmath1-part , respectively .",
    "we denote @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) as the stochastic variables which takes @xmath5 for probability @xmath21 and @xmath22 for probability @xmath23 , where @xmath21 ( @xmath24 ) is a constant .    for the simple expression of the dynamics ,",
    "we employ the local flow @xmath25 , which is the number of transiting particles from site @xmath18 to site @xmath26 .",
    "due to the time evolution rule , the movement of a particle to the next site is expressed as @xmath27 for @xmath28 ( @xmath20 ) .    since we introduce the jump priority rule , the number of jumping particles from the end of @xmath18-th @xmath0-part to the top of @xmath29-th one is @xmath30 in the case @xmath31 , one has @xmath32 and in the case @xmath33 , @xmath34 here , we consider the modulo of @xmath4 for the index of the site number .    the time evolution of @xmath35 is written in the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the subtraction of the number of outgoing particles at site @xmath9 from that of incoming ones , which is expressed as a combination of some @xmath25",
    ". then , we obtain the time evolution rule : @xmath38 and @xmath39 for other sites .    obviously , by adding both hand sides for @xmath40 , one has @xmath41 , which means the conservation law of the total number of particles .",
    "furthermore , by introducing a new dependent variable @xmath42 , the time evolution rule of @xmath43 is the same as that of @xmath35 under the replacement @xmath44 , which means that the dynamics is the same as that of particle under the inverted direction when observing the states for each time in interchanging empty sites and occupied ones .",
    "such a good symmetry does not hold if one gives priority to the movement .",
    "we note that jump probability @xmath21 is not constant but monotonously increasing as time passes in the original model proposed by ohta et al . because rnapiis are more concerned as transcription started .",
    "we also note that the system is the same as the eca rule 184 if jump probability @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig - orig - evol ] shows an example of the time - space pattern of this system . by increasing the number of particles",
    ", traffic jams happens at the end of @xmath1-parts .",
    "to understand such a phenomenon , we consider the dynamics of the simplest case in the next section .    , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 .",
    "to construct the fundamentals of the mathematical analysis for the path - preference model , we consider the simplest case , where the system consists only on one @xmath0-part and one @xmath1-part and the jump probability @xmath52 . now",
    ", we define @xmath53 and @xmath54 as the number of sites in the @xmath0-part and the @xmath1-part ( then , @xmath55 ) , i.e. , the sites from @xmath56 to @xmath57 belong to the @xmath0-part and @xmath58 to @xmath59 to the @xmath1-part . by this simplification ,",
    "the particle on the end of the @xmath0-part must go back to its top if there are no particles .",
    "the mathematical representation of this simplest version is shown in appendix a. we note that the orbit which started from an arbitrary initial value is finally attracted by a limit cycle because the time evolution rule is deterministic and the number of states are finite .",
    "then , the behavior of the system is finally characterized by limit cycles .",
    "we first consider the behavior of this system by focusing on the number of particles @xmath60 . in the case where @xmath60 are sufficiently small ,",
    "all particles are finally trapped by the @xmath0-part once they arrived there for most of initial values due to the time evolution rule and such behavior can be kept for @xmath61 . if @xmath62 , the @xmath0-part can not hold all particles and overflowed ones are emitted to the @xmath1-part . in other words , the traffic on the @xmath0-part is always optimized for maximizing efficiency of the traffics . in particular , if @xmath53 is even , particles in the @xmath0-part generate a closed flow which prohibits other particles to join and those in the @xmath1-part never come back to the @xmath0-part and finally cause the unsolvable traffic jam at the end of the @xmath1-part . if @xmath53 is odd , there is at least one area which satisfies @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the @xmath0-part for any limit cycles . at space - time pattern",
    ", this area looks like a notch , which permits the particles at the @xmath1-part to move back to the @xmath0-part and helps the dynamics be richer .",
    "hereafter , we mainly consider the case where @xmath53 is odd .",
    "we stress that limit cycles are not uniquely determined only by given @xmath60 but depend on the configuration of particles at the initial state .",
    "most of initial states run the orbit which belong to a general class discussed here but some of them to other more complicated classes discussed later .",
    "the value  flow \" , which is defined as the number of moving particles per a site , is a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of the general traffic models .",
    "however , it is not naively applicable for this model because there is an ambiguity of the distance for the jump . to match a model with experiments",
    ", we should take this distance properly .",
    "for example , it should be @xmath5 in the figure of 8-shape traffic model and it is taken as the length of the hurdled intron in the original path - preference model . in this paper , we consider the flow of each part instead of whole flow to avoid such not so essential discussion and focus on mathematical one .",
    "we also ignore the movement between two parts . by denoting @xmath65 and @xmath66 as the flow of the @xmath0-part and the @xmath1-part respectively ,",

    "we next discuss the limit cycles arisen by special initial states .",
    "if the number of particles is sufficiently small , one can construct the system which provides such cycles .",

    "therefore , in this case , not all particles are trapped in the @xmath0-part for this limit cycle even if @xmath60 is less than @xmath143 against the discussion before .",
    "such special parameters and initial values can be constructed by setting , for example , @xmath144 for @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath140 for other sites . by numerical experiments",
    ", we observe that such special initial states are rare .",
    "however , they arise relatively often around @xmath80 , which can be an indirect evidence of the phase shift by this point . generally , it is very difficult problem to determine from initial states or construct such limit cycles for larger @xmath60 because these special limit cycles are induced by very complicated and balanced interactions and so unstable that they are attracted by the stable limit cycles with a little perturbation such as shifting one of particles to the neighbor empty site .",
    "we finally note that such special initial states are not depend on the parity of @xmath53 , differently from general limit cycles .",
    "[ fig - smpl - time - evol3 ] is an example of such limit cycles . by observing these cycles ,",

    "due to the discussion above , the number of notches should be odd for the odd - length @xmath0-part and even for the even - length .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain the properties of these special limit cycles generally by the method to discuss general one like above because we have to prepare concrete limit cycles in this method .",
    "however , by numerical observation , one may classify these special limit cycles like general ones and the condition to attract is independent on that of general ones ( see fig .",

    "in this paper , we considered the dynamics for the simplified version of the path - preference model .",
    "we discuss the property for a class of limit cycles , which are raised by general initial states , for example , the conditions of system parameters where the orbit is attracted by one of them and the exact value of the flow in each part which depend only on the length of each part and the number of particles .",
    "if one wants to apply to that for more complex lives , for example , humans , one should consider the original path - preference model which contains stochastic factors and several @xmath0- and @xmath1-parts .",
    "one can expect that the dynamics of the simplified model with the stochastic factor is the intermediate between the simplified model and the eca rule 184 which correspond @xmath52 and @xmath150 , respectively and the numerical results follows this expectation .",
    "one can expect that the number of the particles is also dominant for the dynamics of @xmath11 @xmath0- and @xmath1-parts model with no stochastic factors and traffic jams occur at the end of @xmath1-parts as it increases",
    ". this may also be true by numerical experiments",
    ".    we should also remember that we employ the jump priority rule just because of the mathematical symmetry .",
    "if experiments follow the jump priority rule , our model is not applicable to this field .",
    "however , we can apply similar discussion with a little modification to predict the behavior of the system .",
    "for example , the aspect of the dynamics is the same as that in the jump priority rule when the number of particles is sufficiently small but it behaves similar to the eca rule 184 when the number of particles is sufficiently large .    in the case including other factors , for example , regulation by the epigenetic modification or non - genetic bases to the path - preference model , the global behavior of the dynamics still keeps if these factors effect the dynamics locally .",
    "we do not understand properties about special limit cycles , for example , the classification of such cycles or what initial states are attracted by the special limit cycles and their properties like general ones .",
    "these topics are only mathematically interesting but not real dynamics .",
    "recent measurements reveal that there are not few genes which contain only one exon . among 24,875 human genes in refgene ( hg19 )",
    "database , the number of genes which consist only one exon is estimated to be 985 and the lengths of these genes are ranging from 27 to 91672bp .",
    "this result indicates that the range of our result is broad in spite of its simplicity .",
    "if one can observe the transcription dynamics for one gene , we expect that our result helps to analyze it .",

    "<S> the path - preference model is a cellular - automaton model to describe the dynamics of rna polymerase ii in transcription . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference from the standard traffic flow model is that it contains another preferential paths at some sites . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an exact analysis for the simplest version of this model which consists on the minimal structure and removes stochastic factors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the number of particles is dominant to the dynamics of this version and observed that there are not only expected phase shift but also several non - continuous gaps as the number of particles increases . by considering the behavior of limit cycles , we also determine the point where such gaps in the flow appear and the exact value of the flow . </S>"
