    "we present a new statistical model for predicting discrete events over time , called reactive point processes ( rpps ) .",
    "rpps are a natural fit for many different domains , and their development was motivated by the problem of predicting serious events ( fires , explosions , power failures ) in the underground electrical grid of new york city ( nyc ) . in new york city and in other major urban centers ,",
    "power - grid reliability is a major source of concern , as demand for electrical power is expected to soon exceed the amount we are able to deliver with our current infrastructure [ @xcite ] .",
    "many american electrical grids are massive and have been built gradually since the time of thomas edison in the 1880s .",
    "for instance , in manhattan alone , there are over 21,216 miles of underground cable , which is almost enough cable to wrap once around the earth .",
    "manhattan s power distribution system is the oldest in the world , and nyc s power utility company , con edison , has cable databases that started in the 1880s . within the last decade , in order to handle increasing demands on nyc s power - grid and increasing threats to public safety , con edison has developed and deployed various proactive programs and policies [ @xcite ] . in manhattan , there are approximately 53,000 access points to the underground electrical grid , which are called electrical service structures or manholes .",
    "problems in the underground distribution network are manifested as problems within manholes , such as underground burnouts or serious events . a multi - year , ongoing collaboration to predict these events in advance",
    "was started in 2007 [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ] , where diverse historical data were used to predict manhole events over a long - term horizon , as the data were not originally processed enough to predict events in the short term .",
    "being able to predict manhole events accurately in the short term could immediately lead to reduced risks to public safety and increased reliability of electrical service .",
    "the data from this collaboration have sufficiently matured due to iterations of the knowledge discovery process and maturation of the con edison inspections program , and , in this paper , we show that it is indeed possible to predict manhole events to some extent within the short term .    the fact that rpps are a generative model allows them to be used for cost - benefit analysis , and thus for policy decisions .",
    "in particular , since we can use rpps to simulate power failures into the future , we can also simulate various inspection policies that the power company might implement . this way we can create a robust simulation setup for evaluating the relative costs of different inspection policies for nyc .",
    "this type of cost - benefit analysis can quantify the cost of the inspections program as it relates to the forecasted number of manhole events .",
    "rpps capture several important properties of power failures on the grid :    * there is an instantaneous rise in vulnerability to future serious events immediately following an occurrence of a past serious event , and the vulnerability gradually fades back to the baseline level .",
    "this is a type of _ self - exciting _ property .",
    "* there is an instantaneous decrease in vulnerability due to an inspection , repair or other action taken .",
    "the effect of this inspection fades gradually over time .",
    "this is a _ self - regulating _ property . * the cumulative effect of events or inspections can saturate , ensuring that vulnerability levels never stray too far beyond their baseline level .",
    "this captures _ diminishing returns _ of many events or inspections in a row . *",
    "the baseline level can be altered if there is at least one past event .",
    "* vulnerability between similar entities should be similar .",
    "rpps can be incorporated into a bayesian framework that shares information across observably similar entities .",
    "rpps extend self - exciting point processes ( sepps ) , which have only the self - exciting property mentioned above .",
    "self - exciting processes date back at least to the 1960s [ @xcite ] .",
    "the applicability of self - exciting point processes for modeling and analyzing time - series data has stimulated interest in diverse disciplines , including seismology [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ] , criminology [ @xcite ] , finance [ @xcite ] , computational neuroscience [ @xcite ] , genome sequencing [ @xcite ] and social networks [ @xcite ] .",
    "these models appear in so many different domains because they are a natural fit for time - series data where one would like to predict discrete events in time , and where the occurrence of a past event gives a temporary boost to the probability of an event in the future .",
    "a  recent work on bayesian modeling for dependent point processes is that of @xcite . paralleling the development of frequentist literature ,",
    "many bayesian approaches are motivated by data on natural events .",
    "@xcite , for example , develop a bayesian framework for the epidemic - type - aftershock - sequences ( etas ) model .",
    "nonparametric bayesian approaches for modeling data from nonhomogeneous point pattern data have also been developed [ see @xcite , e.g. ] .",
    "@xcite present a nonparametric bayesian approach that uses hawkes models for relational data .",
    "an expanded related work section appears in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] .",
    "the self - regulating property can be thought of as the effect of an inspection .",
    "inspections are made according to a predetermined policy of an external source , which may be deterministic or random . in the application that self - exciting point processes are the",
    "most well known for , namely , earthquake modeling , it is not possible to take an action to preemptively reduce the risk of an earthquake ; however , in other applications it is clearly possible to do so . in our power failure application , power companies can perform preemptive inspections and repairs in order to decrease electrical grid vulnerability . in neuroscience , it is possible to take an action to temporarily reduce the firing rate of a neuron .",
    "there are many actions that police can take to temporarily reduce crime in an area ( e.g. , temporary increased patrolling or monitoring ) . in medical applications , doses of medicine",
    "can be preemptively applied to reduce the probability of a cardiac arrest or other event .",
    "alternatively , for instance , the self - regulation can come as a result of the patient s lab tests or visits to a physician .",
    "another way that rpps expand upon sepps is that they allow deviations from the baseline vulnerability level to saturate . even if there are repeated events or inspections in a short period of time , the vulnerability level still stays within a realistic range . in the original self - exciting point process model , it is possible for the self - excitation to escalate to the point where the probability of an event gets very close to one , which is generally unrealistic . in rpps ,",
    "the saturation function prevents this from happening .",
    "also , if many inspections are done in a row , the vulnerability level does not drop to zero , and there are diminishing returns for the later ones because of the saturation function .",
    "we motivate rpps using the power - grid application in section  [ sec : description_of_data ] .",
    "we first introduce the general form of the rpp model in section  [ secrppmodel ] .",
    "we discuss a bayesian framework for fitting rpps in section  [ secfitting ] .",
    "the bayesian formulation , which we implement using approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) , allows us to share information across observably similar entities ( manholes in our case ) . for both methods we fit the model to nyc data and performed simulation studies .",
    "section  [ secpredictionexperiment ] contains a prediction experiment , demonstrating the rpps ability to predict future events in nyc .",
    "once the rpp model is fit to data from the past , it can be used for simulation .",
    "in particular , we can simulate various inspection policies for the manhattan grid and examine the costs associated with each of them in order to choose the best inspection policy .",
    "section  [ secinspectionpolicies ] shows this type of simulation using the rpp , illustrating how it is able to help choose between different inspection policies , and thus assist with broader policy decisions for the nyc inspections program .",
    "the paper s supplementary material [ @xcite ] includes a related work section , conditional frequency estimator ( cf estimator ) for the rpp , experiments with a maximum likelihood approach , a  description of the inspection policy used in section  [ secinspectionpolicies ] and simulation studies for validating the fitting techniques for the models in the paper .",
    "it also includes a description and link for a publicly available simulated data set that we generated , based on statistical properties of the manhattan data set .    a short version of this paper appeared in the late - breaking developments track of aaai-13 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the data used for the project includes records from the emergency control systems ( ecs ) trouble ticket system of con edison , which includes records of responses to past events ( total 213,504 records for 53,525 manholes from 1995 until 2010 ) .",
    "part of the trouble ticket for a manhole fire is in figure  [ fig : ticket ] .",
    "events can include serious problems such as manhole fires or explosions , or nonserious events such as wire burnouts .",
    "these tickets are heavily processed into a structured table , where each record indicates the time , manhole type ( `` service box '' or `` manhole , '' and we refer to both types as manholes colloquially ) , the unique identifier of the manhole and details about the event .",
    "the trouble tickets are classified automatically as to whether they represent events ( the kind we would like to predict and prevent ) or not ( in which case the ticket is irrelevant and removed ) . the processing of tickets is based on a study where con edison engineers manually labeled tickets , and is discussed further by @xcite .",
    "we have more or less complete event data from 1999 until the present , and incomplete event data between 1995 and 1999 .",
    "a plot of the total number of events per year ( using our definition of what constitutes an event ) is provided in figure  [ fig : dataset_histograms](a ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "keeping our electrical infrastructure safe and reliable is of critical concern , as power outages affect almost all aspects of our society , including hospitals , financial centers , data centers , transportation and supermarkets . if we are able to combine historical data with the best available statistical tools , it will be possible to impact our ability to maintain an ever aging and growing power grid . in this work",
    ", we presented a methodology for modeling power - grid failures that is based on natural assumptions : ( i ) that power failures have a self - exciting property , which was hypothesized by con edison engineers , ( ii ) that the power company s actions are able to regulate vulnerability levels , ( iii ) that the effects on the vulnerability level of past events or repairs can saturate , and ( iv ) that vulnerability estimates should be similar between similar entities .",
    "we have been able to show directly ( using the cf estimator for the rpp ) that the self - exciting and saturation assumptions hold .",
    "we demonstrated through experiments on past power - grid data from nyc , and through simulations , that the rpp model is able to capture the relevant dynamics well enough to predict power failures better than the current approaches in use .",
    "the modeling assumptions that underlie rpps can be directly ported to other problems .",
    "rpps are a natural fit for problems in healthcare , where medical conditions cause self - excitation and treatments provide regulation . through the bayesian framework we introduced ,",
    "rpps extend to a broad range of problems where predictive power can be pooled among multiple related entities , whether manholes or medical patients .",
    "the results presented in this work show for the first time that manhole events can be predicted in the short term , which was previously thought not to be possible . knowing how one might do this permits us to take preventive action to keep vulnerability levels low , and can help make broader policy decisions for power - grid maintenance through simulation of many uncertain futures , simulated over any desired policy ."
