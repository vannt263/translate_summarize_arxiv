    "black holes have no hair ; they are the simplest celestial objects , fully characterized by their mass and spin . scaling between supermassive and galactic black hole ( gbh ) systems",
    "should _ theoretically _ be very simple .",
    "there should be a fundamental similarity between the accretion flow as a function of @xmath0 , with only a weak dependence on black hole mass .",
    "for example , standard optically thick accretion disc models predict that the spectrum should be dominated by a multi - temperature blackbody component ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , irrespective of the factor of @xmath1@xmath2 difference in mass . the only significant difference should be the energy at which the peak in the spectrum is observed ( in @xmath3 representation , where @xmath4 is energy flux per unit energy ) . at the eddington luminosity",
    "this should be @xmath51  kev in gbh and @xmath510  ev in agn .",
    "the idea of a ( mostly ) mass - invariant accretion flow is also backed by observational evidence for simple scaling relations of the accretion flow between very different mass black holes ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ) .",
    "however , observations also clearly show that the accretion flow is much more complicated than the simple shakura - sunyaev disc model .",
    "gbh show a variety of different types of x - ray spectral and variability behaviour , which are used to classify the accretion flow into different spectral states ( e.g. tanaka & lewin 1995 ; van der klis 2000 ; mcclintock & remillard 2005 ; done & gierliski 2003 ; zdziarski & gierliski 2004 ) . at high luminosity ( @xmath6 )",
    "the gbh show two main spectral states , the high / soft ( or thermal dominant ) and very high ( steep power law ) .",
    "both of these generally have peak energy output at @xmath7  kev , as expected from an optically thick disc at these high mass accretion rates .",
    "however , they also show a tail of emission to higher energies produced by compton scattering of seed photons from the disc by energetic electrons .",
    "this tail is rather complex ( e.g. gierliski et al . 1999 ) , but can roughly be described by a power law . in the high / soft state",
    "this tail is rather weak and has energy spectral index @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) while in the very high state , the tail carries a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity and has @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , at lower luminosities the gbh can show qualitatively different emission , forming the low / hard state .",
    "here they have only a weak disc component and have a dominant _ hard _ comptonized tail .",
    "again its shape is rather complex ( e.g. the review by zdziarski & gierliski 2004 ) , but can be roughly described as a power law of energy index @xmath11 = 0.51 ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) .    by analogy , the agn should also show these different x - ray spectral states ( see e.g. white , fabian & mushotzky 1984 for an early example of this ) , and hopefully these intrinsic differences in spectra could explain some of the different types of agn behaviour which can not be modelled in simple orientation dependent unification schemes .",
    "very broadly , liners have very low @xmath0 , so might correspond to the extreme ( hardest spectra ) low / hard states seen in gbh , many seyfert 1 s are at a few percent of eddington , so could be bright low / hard state , while pg quasars and especially narrow line seyfert 1 s ( nls1 s ) are generally at high @xmath0 , so would correspond to the high / soft or very high states of gbh ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ; see e.g. woo & urry 2002 , boronson 2002 and collin & kawaguchi 2004 for estimates of @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , unlike the gbh , transitions between these states are unobservable , making them more difficult to identify .",
    "the gbh make transitions between the spectral states on timescales of a few days ( e.g. cui et al .",
    "1997 ; wilson & done 2001 ; kalemci et al .",
    "this translates to timescales of 300 to @xmath12 years when scaled from @xmath13 m@xmath14 to @xmath15@xmath16 m@xmath14 black hole mass .",
    "the one exception is the very luminous system grs 1915 + 105 , where state transitions can occur on timescales of a few seconds ( belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) , implying 101000 days timescales in supermassive black holes .",
    "nonetheless , agn do show substantial variability in their x - ray emission on timescales of days and even hours ( e.g. nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) . instead of true state transitions",
    ", this must correspond to the gbh variability seen on much shorter timescales , between milliseconds and seconds .",
    "this range of timescales is usually studied via power density spectra ( pds ) . in the gbh the pds shape between 0.001100  hz is a strong function of the spectral state of the source , showing that the spectral and timing behaviour are generally correlated .",
    "for example , in cyg x-1 , the overall shape of the pds in the low / hard state can be approximately described as band- limited noise in @xmath17 representation ( where @xmath18 is frequency and @xmath19 is variability power at that frequency ) , with a ` flat top ' ( @xmath20 ) so that most of the power is emitted between two break frequencies , @xmath21  hz and @xmath22  hz ( e.g. gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 1999 ) . by contrast",
    ", its high / soft state has a high - frequency break at @xmath23  hz ( e.g. gilfanov et al . 1999 ) and no low frequency break , so its overall shape is characteristic of a low - pass filter rather than of band - limited noise .",
    "here we look in more detail at the correspondence between agn and gbh power spectra , as there is now a growing number of dedicated agn monitoring campaigns .",
    "one of the goals of these studies is to use the characteristic timescales in the pds to estimate the black hole mass in agn .",
    "in particular we stress that the high - frequency break is _ not _ constant , even _ within _ the low / hard state , so while this break can be used as an _ indicator _ of black hole mass , it can not be used to make accurate predictions .",
    "we also stress that at high mass accretion rates the gbh energy spectra are often dominated by the disc emission this has very little variability compared to the comptonized tail ( churazov , gilfanov & revnivtsev 2001 ) , so it suppresses the rms variability in the high / soft state gbh .",
    "the much lower disc temperature in agn means that their spectra are dominated by the comptonized tail , so this bandpass effect means that agn can have much higher apparent rms variability .",
    "this removes one of the problems in identifying the often rapidly variable narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( leighly 1999 ) as the supermassive counterparts of the high / soft state ( pounds et al .",
    "1995 ) , while other issues due to the shape of the pds can be resolved by recognizing the diversity of possible high mass accretion rate states .",
    "we caution that cyg x-1 does not sample a large range in mass accretion rate , and shows a possibly unique pds in its high / soft state , so using this object as a template for agn behaviour can severely distort attempts to scale the variability between supermassive and stellar black holes .",

    "cyg x-1 _ can _ also show such peaked power spectra ( during its ` failed ' transitions to the high / soft state , pottschmidt et al .",

    "the spectrum of the high / soft state of xte j1650500 shows that the disc spectrum dominates the low energy pca bandpass , so can strongly suppress the apparent variability .",

    "even if the tail is @xmath39 per cent of the bolometric luminosity , its contribution to the total pca count rate is much smaller for a high - temperature disc than for a lower temperature one due to the decreasing instrument response at higher energies .",
    "however , we have examined all the available high - energy power spectra from the outbursts of many gbh and have _ never _ seen a high / soft state pds which resembles that of the ` canonical ' high / soft state derived from cyg x-1 .",

    "the total rms for the full- and high - energy bandpass are @xmath43 and @xmath44 per cent respectively , so clearly again the variability is more marked by excluding the disc emission , but the effect is not so drastic as in the high / soft state as the strong tail means the disc dilution is not so important . _",

    "the much longer timescales involved mean that only a few agn have been monitored to the extent that power spectra can be derived .",
    "the power spectra are also more complex to calculate than those from gbh as the data are generally unevenly sampled .",
    "this gives a broad window function which redistributes power over a wide range of frequencies , so reconstructing the intrinsic power spectrum is analogous to deriving the intrinsic energy spectrum from the broad spectral response of an x - ray proportional counter",

    "these derived power spectra typically become less well defined at the lowest frequencies , so the uncertainties increase in the last decade in frequency of each reconstruction .",

    "while the x - ray spectra of both agn and gbh should be dominated by the hard comptonized tail at low @xmath0 , the higher temperature disc expected in the gbh means that this dominates their x - ray emission in the high / soft and very high states , while the corresponding agn spectra will be dominated by the soft comptonized tail seen in these states ( see also mchardy et al .",
    "thus the agn power spectra should be compared only to the high - energy power spectra in gbh ( cyan points in fig  [ fig : pds ] ) _ not _ that derived from the total x - ray bandpass ( black points ) .    however , there is also a secondary issue which is the _ shape _ of the power spectrum .",

    "however , another nls1 , akn564 , convincingly shows _ band - limited _ flat top noise , where the flat top extends over only @xmath52 decades in frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agn_pds ] taken from a combination of low- and high - frequency data in markowitz et al .",
    "2003 and vignali et al .",
    "such band - limited , high rms ( @xmath5 30 per cent ) noise is consistent with the extreme low / hard state of gbh ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pds]c ) .",
    "however , akn 564 has high @xmath62 ( table  [ tab : agn ] ) , so should instead be comparable to the high mass accretion rate gbh .",
    "its pds is clearly _ unlike _ that of ngc  4051 ( and the high / soft state of cyg x-1 ) .",
    "instead it could correspond to the pds of the compton tail seen in the very high state ( transient ) gbh .",
    "these likewise show band - limited noise similar to that of the low / hard state , with the flat top extending over two decades in frequency , though this is usually accompanied by a strong qpo ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pds]f , zdziarski et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , current agn data probably can not rule out the presence of even a very strong qpo such as that seen in the very high state since the uneven sampling strongly smears out the power ( vaughan & uttley 2005 ) .",
    "if a qpo is not present with better sampling of the agn light curve then it may be that akn 564 instead represents a scaled up version of a very high state from a _ persistent _ gbh .",
    "there are as yet no data on such gbh systems ( cyg x-1 never shows a very high state ) , but we speculate by analogy with the cyg x-1 low / hard state pds that these would have weaker qpo features than those seen in the transient systems .    band - limited noise is also probably detected in another high @xmath63 agn , ngc  3783 ( markowitz et al . 2003 ) .",
    "here the situation is rather less clear , as @xmath64 , i.e. close to the maximum low / hard state luminosity .",
    "uncertainties in mass and bolometric luminosity mean this could easily fall or rise by a factor 23 .",
    "thus this could either represent a bright low / hard state or a dim very high state ( sometimes termed an intermediate state : belloni et al .",
    "1996 ; mndez & van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "these different ` states ' merge smoothly together in the gbh , which can be explained in the context of a truncated disc extending closer to the black hole , increasing the overlap between the disc and hot inner flow as the source moves from low / hard to intermediate and very high states ( wilson & done 2001 ; kubota & done 2004 ) .",
    "the only other high @xmath0 agn with published power spectrum is the nls1 , mkn766 .",
    "here there is no data on long timescales , but the ( evenly sampled ) xmm - newton data strongly indicate a break at @xmath65 hz ( vaughan & fabian 2003 ; vaughan , fabian & iwasawa 2004 ) . the normalization of the flat top noise is lower than that for the other agn ( high or low @xmath0 ) ,",
    "so this may correspond to a high state counterpart of a transient gbh .",
    "despite its use a template pds , cyg x-1 s timing properties are not typical of gbh .",
    "the high / soft state pds is markedly different , with flat top ( in @xmath17 ) extending over at least four orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "by contrast , power spectra of the compton tail in other gbh in the high / soft state are instead usually strongly peaked at @xmath510 hz , or have complex shapes .",
    "the difference in cyg x-1 is perhaps connected to the persistent nature of its emission due to the large accretion rate from its high - mass companion ob star .",
    "the x - ray bolometric luminosity varies by very little , @xmath0 = 0.010.1 , over timescales of weeks  years .",
    "by contrast , most gbh have low - mass companions , with much lower mass transfer rates through the roche lobe so have transient outbursts where the accretion flow luminosity changes from @xmath66 to 0.051 ( e.g. mcclintock , narayan & rybicki 2004 ) .",
    "we speculate that the large dynamic range of variability seen in transients may excite a rather different noise spectrum of turbulence in the disc . the observed pds is the convolution of this intrinsic power spectrum with the response of the disc ( e.g. psaltis & norman 2000 ) . for a particular disc geometry ,",
    "the response of the disc ( its filter ) is fixed ( churazov et al . 2001 ; psaltis & norman 2000 ) , but if the intrinsic noise spectrum changes then the observed pds will also change .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the disc instability which causes the dramatic outbursts in the transient gbh should also operate in agn i.e. whether the initial spectrum of fluctuations is similar to that in cyg x-1 or the transient gbh .",
    "the instability is triggered by the dramatic increase in opacity caused by the partial ionization of hydrogen at temperatures of @xmath67  k. such temperatures are clearly expected in agn ( siemiginowska , czerny & kostyunin 1996 ; burderi , king & szuszkiewicz 1998 ) .",
    "however , this needs to propagate globally through the disc rather than being a purely local instability in order to produce dramatic outbursts , which requires a _ change _ in the effective @xmath11 viscosity parameter .",
    "this is probably produced in gbh discs by a change in viscosity mechanism , from the mri where hydrogen is ionized , to much weaker processes ( eg spiral arms ) where hydrogen is neutral .",
    "physically , this could be linked to the large change in density of free electrons between the parts of the disc in which hydrogen is ionized and neutral .",
    "if the neutral disc is _ very _ neutral , then the lack of charge carriers suppresses the coupling of magnetic fields to the disc , shutting off the mri viscosity ( gammie & menou 1998 ) . however , agn discs at the critical hydrogen ionization temperature are much less dense than gbh discs at this temperature .",
    "recombination processes , especially three body recombination , will be much less efficient at these lower densities , so while hydrogen is mainly neutral there may be enough free electrons from potassium / iron etc to allow the mri to still operate as a viscosity mechanism ( menou & quataert 2001 ) .",
    "thus the hydrogen ionization point would not trigger a global instability in agn discs ( janiuk et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , this is still to some extent speculative , so it is not yet known whether we expect agn variability to be more like persistent gbh ( i.e. cyg x-1 ) or like the transients .",
    "observation _ of a cyg x-1 like high / soft power spectrum in the nearby nls1 ngc 4051 argues for a suppression of the hydrogen ionization disc instability in this agn , where the flat part of the power spectrum extends over more than 4 decades in frequency ( mchardy et al .",
    "the lack of clear qpo signatures in agn ( while mainly due to lack of statistics on the relevant timescales : e.g. vaughan 2005 ) may also be a feature of a different disc turbulence spectrum characteristic of persistent sources .",
    "better agn power spectra , with better constraints on potential qpo signatures could give observational insights into the operation of the mri and hydrogen ionization instability in these massive discs .",
    "power spectra of agn are used to estimate the black hole mass by scaling characteristic timescales ( breaks ) to those seen in the galactic sources , most commonly using cyg x-1 as the template pds .",
    "however , this assumes that the pds shape is constant , while the gbh show clearly that the characteristic frequencies change significantly even within a single gbh state , and that the whole shape of the pds can change with state transitions .",
    "however , this does not mean that scaling can not yield useful constraints , though it certainly can not give accurate black hole masses .",
    "the high - frequency break changes by only a factor @xmath5  5 within the low / hard state of gbh , and this is rather less than the discrepancy inferred from relating break frequency to mass for the lowest mass known agn , ngc  4395 . either the mass of this black hole is overestimated ( for which there is some additional evidence ) , or there is some other variability process occurring which breaks the correspondence between this agn and the gbh .    at high mass accretion rates ,",
    "the x - ray spectra from gbh can be dominated by the rather stable disc emission , while the much lower disc temperature in agn means that their x - ray spectra are dominated instead by the compton tail .",
    "this bandpass effect means that the low variability often cited as being characteristic of the high / soft state is characteristic of the _ disc_. at higher energies , where comptonization dominates , gbh can exhibit large amplitudes of variability , as required to match with agn , especially the nls1 s .",
    "the shape of the pds in the high / soft state is generally strongly peaked , not at all like the low pass filter pds characteristic of the high / soft state in cyg x- 1 . since some nls1s ( ngc  4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 : mchardy et al . 2004 ; 2005 )",
    "show pds which look convincingly like cyg x-1 , we speculate that the hydrogen ionization instability ( which gives rise to the transient behaviour in gbh ) does not operate in agn .",
    "however , there are also some nls1 s which show band - limited pds , similar to those seen in the low / hard state .",
    "we show that such pds can also be interpreted as transient high / soft state pds or very high state pds , so that band - limited noise is _ not _ a unique tracer of low mass accretion rates .",
    "agn variability _ can _ be interpreted as the supermassive analogue of the gbh variability , but only with careful matching of spectral states , and careful consideration of the different spectral components .",
