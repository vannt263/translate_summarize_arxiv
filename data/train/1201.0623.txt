    "the universality of the initial mass function ( imf ) has been debated from the time that @xcite first introduced the idea of an imf .",
    "the massive part of the imf can be represented by its slope from the inflection point at @xmath9 to the most massive stars and is described by its slope ( @xmath10 ) , which is the so - called salpeter - type imf .",
    "several star forming regions show somewhat shallower slopes of @xmath11 in the massive part , particularly for the most massive star forming clusters , even though we take the observational uncertainties in the photometric calibrations into account .",
    "for example , the arches cluster shows @xmath12 @xcite and the core of ngc 3603 shows @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , the main reason for the difficulty in investigating the imf of these clusters is that they are either highly reddened or very distant .",
    "the @xmath1 carina nebula ( ngc 3372 ) is the largest nebula in the southern sky and is one of the most interesting regions in the galaxy .",
    "more than 60 o - type stars and several young open clusters are located in or near the nebula , including tr 14 and tr 16 in the bright part of the nebula .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 carinae , which is known as one of the most massive stars in the galaxy , is near the center of tr 16 .",
    "although the arches cluster and ngc 3603 appear to be more massive , the young open clusters in the @xmath1 carina nebula offer many advantages .",
    "they are relatively close and less reddened , and are therefore able to be investigated in more detail .",
    "many previous investigators have studied these clusters .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite presented spectral types of the stars in the region .",
    "@xcite performed a proper motion study and presented membership probability of stars down to @xmath14 mag .",
    "previous studies include optical photometry @xcite , near - ir ( nir ) @xmath15 photometry @xcite , or x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the slope of the imf ( @xmath16 ) for tr 14 and tr 16 for @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite summarized the observational evidences of ongoing star formation activity in the @xmath1 carina nebula .",
    "recently , @xcite ( the _ chandra _ carina complex project  cccp ) published a vast amount of information on the stellar content and star formation activity in the @xmath1 carina nebula region .",
    "as these clusters are in the line of sight toward the tangential point of the sagittarius spiral arm , it has been questioned as to whether the young open clusters in the @xmath1 carina nebula are at the same distance or not .",
    "tr 14 and tr 16 , in particular , have been at the center of this controversial question .",
    "in addition , it is also argued that these two clusters exhibit an abnormal reddening law . @xcite .",
    "most photometric studies have estimated the distances of these clusters to be 2.04.0 kpc .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained @xmath18 kpc for the distance to @xmath1 carinae using the proper motion of the homunculus nebula around @xmath1 carinae .",
    "the aims of this study are ( 1 ) to judge whether the reddening law in the @xmath1 carina nebula is abnormal or not , ( 2 ) to determine the distance to the young open clusters in the nebula and decide whether they are at the same distance or not , and ( 3 ) to obtain the imf of the young open clusters in the nebula down to the inflection point @xmath19 and determine its slope . in section  2",
    "we present our new optical data and describe the data sets used in this work . in section  3 , we determine the reddening law and distance modulus .",

    "others were based on photoelectric photometry . in the comparison , we have excluded stars that deviated by more than @xmath25 from the mean to avoid the inclusion of variables or optical doubles .",
    "our photometry is in good agreement with previous photoelectric photometry and ccd photometry by @xcite .",
    "but although we find no significant difference in the photometric zero point in @xmath26 , we find a large scatter in the comparison with the photoelectric data and simple aperture photometric data of @xcite .",

    "the cccp provided a catalog of 14369 x - ray sources in a 1.42 deg@xmath41 area including the region observed by @xcite .",
    "there were 3338 cccp sources in our field of view .",
    "both x - ray catalogs supplied the 2mass counterpart of x - ray sources .",

    "next , we searched for optical counterparts of x - ray sources without a 2mass i d using a search radius of @xmath42 .",
    "if two or more stars were found within the radius , we assigned the closest star as the optical counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "we identified 192 and 96 stars as x - ray emission stars from the cccp catalog and @xcite , respectively .",
    "as a result , a total of 1184 stars were selected as x - ray emission stars . among them , 441 stars were identified as x - ray sources from both x - ray catalogs .",

    "seven stars ( i d 1817 , 2599 , 2639 , 2754 , 2830 , 3337 , and 3911 ) seem to be foreground late - type stars with similar proper motion vectors by chance to the clusters .",
    "four stars ( i d 2022 , 2033 , 4211 , and 4238 ) are near the boundary of bright nebula ; they are probably highly obscured ( @xmath48 mag ) early - type stars .",
    "six additional stars ( i d 677 , 849 , 1027 , 1374 , 2462 , and 4044 ) have similar photometric characteristics as the four stars mentioned above .",
    "the star i d 849 is an optical double , and shows a variability of @xmath49 mag from four observations .",
    "in addition , the star i d 2572 ( @xmath50 ) shows very strong uv excess with a nir excess ; this star appears to be a classical t tauri star with active accretion .",
    "most x - ray emission stars are fainter than @xmath51 mag and redder than the reddened zams line by about 0.6 mag .",
    "they constitute a well - defined sequence of pms stars in the clusters .",
    "however , a non - negligible number of x - ray emission stars can also be found around the reddened zams line in the ( @xmath26 , @xmath52 ) diagram .",
    "they seem to be x - ray active field stars in front of the @xmath1 carina nebula because their @xmath52 color is not affected by the uv excess and late - type stars retain their x - ray activity for a long time .",
    "there are several x - ray emission stars redder than most pms stars with x - ray emission ; two of them ( i d 2022 and 4211 ) , as already mentioned , are highly reddened early - type stars with high proper motion membership probability .",
    "the star i d 2412 seems to be a foreground late - type star because its position in the ( @xmath53,@xmath54 ) diagram is close to the unreddened zams line .",
    "the x - ray emission star i d 1836 seems to be a late - type member with a strong uv excess .",
    "the other three stars ( i d 3729 , 4081 , and 4212 ) are very difficult to justify as members from optical data alone ; they seem to be highly reddened early - type stars in the ( @xmath55 ) diagram and , in addition , are in the dark lane to the south of tr 16 . the membership of these presumably highly reddened stars , including the four stars mentioned above , is uncertain , and they are for the time being , not included in the member list .",
    "figure  [ ccd ] shows the ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) color  color diagram .",
    "early - type members without proper motion membership probability were selected from the locus of early - type members in figure  [ rv ] ( see section  [ rl ] ) and are marked as open squares in figure  [ ccd ] and [ rv ] .",
    "the reddening of proper motion members and bright members is between @xmath56 = 0.36 and 0.9 .",
    "there are several stars with @xmath57 mag and with high proper motion membership probability ( @xmath58 ) including six early - type stars ( i d 2154 , 2377 , 2475 , 2693 , 3223 , and 4156 ) . were they actual members of the @xmath1 carina nebula , they should be on the blue part of the reddened zams whereas they lie in the middle of the ms band in the @xmath59 cmd .",
    "this implies that they are more likely foreground stars in the spiral arm between @xmath1 carinae and the sun ( see   [ rl ] ) .",
    "there are also several proper motion members in the red part of the @xmath60 line .",
    "blue stars with @xmath61 mag are highly reddened early - type stars , while most red stars near the @xmath60 line are foreground late - type stars .",
    "in addition , there are many x - ray emission stars between @xmath62 0.9  1.3 mag and @xmath63 0.0  0.8 mag",
    ". these are pms stars with uv excess @xcite implying that the pms stars in tr 16 are actively accreting .",

    "the total extinction in the @xmath26 band can be determined using the relation @xmath64 .",
    "the so - called normal reddening law of @xmath65 is consistently obtained for stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite , while many previous studies noted that the total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath66 toward the @xmath1 carina region is anomalously higher @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the membership probability ( @xmath67 ) @xcite as the membership selection criterion and determined @xmath68 mag and @xmath69 for tr 14 [ @xmath70 $ ] , see also @xcite ] .",
    "we have determined the reddening law toward the @xmath1 carina nebula using the relation between @xmath66 and color excess ratios , @xmath71 @xcite .",

    "the reddening in @xmath27 , @xmath74 , is the difference between the observed and the intrinsic @xmath27 .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath27 is determined from the relation between @xmath75 and @xmath76 for ms stars ( see appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "we selected early - type stars to be those with @xmath77 mag and @xmath78 mag or with @xmath77 mag , @xmath79 mag and @xmath80 mag .",
    "the early - type membership selection criteria are @xmath81 and @xmath82 mag .",
    "stars with @xmath83 mag were excluded to avoid contamination by pms stars with strong uv excess or background early - type stars .",
    "a total of 141 early - type members were selected and used to determine the reddening law and distance modulus of the @xmath1 carina nebula .",
    "figure  [ rv ] shows the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath74 .",
    "we determined the color excess ratio due to the intracluster dust to be @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) = @xmath86 and @xmath87 mag using least squares .",
    "the color excess ratio @xmath88 for a normal reddening law is 1.25 @xcite .",
    "the total - to - selective extinction ratio in the @xmath1 carina region ( @xmath89 ) is , therefore , @xmath90 .",
    "if the six early - type stars with @xmath91 mag are included , the resultant foreground reddening @xmath92 and reddening law @xmath66 are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "although we could derive the same distance modulus in the case of a smaller @xmath66 , the reddened zams lines are not well fitted to the distribution of early - type members in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "this fact supports the suggestion that these less reddened early - type stars are foreground stars in the sagittarius spiral arm between @xmath95 11.3 11.8 mag ( see section  [ phd ] ) .",
    "@xcite also applied the same method to determine the reddening law of the nebula .",
    "although there are small differences in the membership selection criteria , their result agrees well with ours .",
    "the small difference between our result and theirs appears to be caused by the number of stars used in the determination of the reddening law ( 53 stars were used in @xcite , while 141 stars were used in this work ) .",
    "as there is no reliable photometric way to estimate the reddening of pms stars , we have to rely on the reddening map derived using the early - type stars .",
    "figure  [ redmap ] shows the reddening map .",
    "the dashed line represents @xmath96 mag and the solid lines represent @xmath97 and @xmath98 mag , respectively , from thin to thick line .",
    "the spatial variation of @xmath56 in figure  [ redmap ] is well matched by the reddening map of @xcite and the extinction map derived by @xcite .",
    "the highly reddened region is to the west of tr 14 ( @xmath99r.a.@xmath100 and @xmath101decl.@xmath102 , where @xmath103r.a . and @xmath103decl .",
    "represent the angular distance in r.a . and dec .",
    "from @xmath1 carinae ) and is well matched by the co emission map of @xcite .      in order to derive the distance modulus of each cluster",
    ", we should first determine the membership containing radius of each cluster .",
    "however , as it is still uncertain whether tr 14 , tr 16 , and cr 232 are dynamically independent clusters , it is therefore very difficult to set the boundaries of each cluster .",
    "we decided to set the centers and boundaries of each cluster so as to include most of proper motion members ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the center and radius of each cluster are @xmath103 r.a.@xmath104 , @xmath103 decl.@xmath105 , and radius = @xmath106 for tr 14 and @xmath103 r.a.@xmath107 , @xmath103 decl.@xmath108 , and radius = @xmath109 for tr 16 ( see figure  [ plot ] ) .",
    "although the proper motion study and spectral classification studies can supply good membership criteria , it is still debated whether tr 14 and tr 16 are at the same distance or not .",
    "two recent optical studies @xcite arrived at different conclusions .",
    "@xcite determined the reddening law in three different ways and adopted an average value .",
    "they adopted @xmath110 and @xmath111 for tr 14 and tr 16 , respectively , and obtained a different distance modulus for each cluster ( @xmath4 mag for tr 14 and @xmath112 mag for tr 16 ) .",
    "however , they did not take into account the difference , in star - forming regions , of the reddening law between the general interstellar medium and the intracluster medium .",
    "in addition , the number of members used in the determination of the reddening law was very small ( 10 stars for tr 14 and 14 stars for tr 16 ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite obtained @xmath113 mag using @xmath114 to avoid the anomalous reddening law at optical wavelengths and concluded that tr 14 and tr 16 are at the same distance . @xcite",
    "determined @xmath115 mag for tr 14 by applying the abnormal reddening law they determined ( see section  [ rl ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite determined the distance to @xmath1 carinae as @xmath116 kpc @xmath117 mag ) from the proper motion of the homunculus nebula ejected from @xmath1 carinae .",
    "we calculated the total extinction in the @xmath26 band of individual early - type members using the reddening - corrected colors and the adopted zams relation @xcite , and constructed the distribution of distance moduli for each cluster .",
    "we find the same distance modulus for tr 14 and tr 16 ( @xmath4 mag , i.e. @xmath5 kpc ) and conclude that tr 14 and tr 16 are at the same distance within the observational errors .",
    "figure  [ dm ] shows the reddening corrected cmds superimposed with the zams relation shifted by the adopted distance modulus .",
    "although it is very difficult to estimate the error in the zams fitting , we can expect an error of at least 0.1 mag .",
    "in addition , the zams relation itself may be uncertain by about 0.1 mag .",
    "the error in the distance modulus determination is , therefore , about 0.2 mag .",
    "our distance modulus is in good agreement with that by @xcite and @xcite , but disagrees with that by @xcite who estimated different distances to tr 14 and tr 16 .",
    "this difference is caused by the applied reddening correction , i.e. the difference in @xmath118 of individual early - type stars .",
    "there is a non - negligible difference in the derived distance between the two methods , the proper motion of the expanding nebula ejected from @xmath1 carinae ( the homunculus nebula ) and the photometric analysis of stars in the nebula .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite performed spectroscopic analyses of the homunculus nebula and determined @xmath119 kpc , @xmath120 kpc , and @xmath121 kpc , respectively .",
    "these are quite consistent each other within the expected error . on the other hand , the distance moduli determined by @xcite and @xcite are comparable with our result of @xmath5 kpc .",
    "because these latter two studies and our work incorporate the abnormal reddening law toward the @xmath1 carina nebula , the consistency of the distance moduli from the photometric studies suggests that our distance determination is realistic .",
    "furthermore , the possibility can not be ruled out that the distance from the proper motion studies of the ejected nebula might be affected by the assumption of a constant expanding velocity and symmetrical shape of the homunculus nebula .",
    "if the expansion velocity of the ejected material varied after the initial ejection , or if the homunculus nebula is asymmetric in shape , the proper motion of the expanding nebula may be underestimated . in addition , as @xmath1 carinae is known to be a binary system @xcite , the influence of the companion star on the expansion of the homunculus nebula should be taken into account . therefore , although our distance modulus is somewhat larger than the distance determined from the proper motion of the ejected nebula , our value reasonably explains the location of the ms band .",
    "recently @xcite studied the proper motion of the homunculus nebula and determined the epoch of the eruption of @xmath1 carinae .",
    "they assumed the distance to @xmath1 carinae as 2.3 kpc .",
    "although most of parameters ( projected velocities , orientation angles , and projected distances from @xmath1 carinae ) may be changed if we adopt the distance to @xmath1 carinae to be 2.9 kpc , the epoch of eruption is nearly the same because the projected velocity of the nebula generally dominates the radial velocity .",
    "the reddening law was used as the primary membership selection criterion for early - type stars . in figure  [ rv ] , most of the early - type stars with @xmath3 lie along the line of @xmath122 .",
    "the lower boundary of membership selection was set to be @xmath123 mag at a given @xmath74 .",
    "we classified stars above the lower boundary and with @xmath82 mag as early - type members .",
    "early - type members selected using the reddening law and without proper motion membership probability are marked as open squares in figure  [ rv ] . from this criterion , some stars with low membership probability ( @xmath124 ) were also selected as members because nearly face - on binary systems may have a low proper motion membership probability .",
    "for instance , hd 93250 ( o3.5v((f+ ) ) , @xmath125 ) , one of the earliest type stars in the @xmath1 carina region , was selected as a member .",
    "the star shows unusually strong x - ray activity @xcite and is a suspected binary system .",

    "@xcite determined the temperature of hd 93129a to be 50,500 k , while @xcite estimated it to be 42,500 k. however , a temperature of 42,500 k is much too low for spectral type o2 .",

    "these two stars are brighter than the evolutionary track of a 120 @xmath146 star and suggests that the mass of the evolved stars ( hd 93162 and @xmath1 carinae ) may be more massive than the upper mass limit ( 100 @xmath147 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated the imf @xmath148area ) for the case of @xmath149 .",
    "the error bars are based on poisson noise . to minimize the binning effect",
    ", we also calculated the imf by shifting 0.1 in @xmath150 and then calculated the slope of the imf @xmath151 .",
    "the slope of the imf ( @xmath11 ) calculated for members and candidates @xmath152 ( standard error ) for tr 14 , @xmath152 for tr 16 , and @xmath153 for all observed regions down to our observational limit ( @xmath154 , table  [ tab_imf ] case ( 1 ) ) .",
    "figure  [ imf ] shows the imf of tr 14 , tr 16 , and all observed area . in the figure ,",
    "the imf calculated for members and candidates is marked as filled circles and that calculated for members - only is marked as open circles .",
    "all imfs are the same as for tr 14 . as tr",
    "14 is a compact cluster and most members are assembled in a small area , we can expect the contamination of field stars to be very low . on the other hand ,",
    "the imf of members and candidates of tr 16 is slightly steeper than the imf calculated for the members - only .",
    "the difference is only apparent for @xmath155 . from the figure",
    ", we can see that the imf for members and candidates and the imf for members - only differ somewhat for @xmath155 .",
    "that is caused by the observational limit of the proper motion study @xcite .",
    "therefore , the imf calculated for members including the candidates should be considered as an upper limit of the imf of the @xmath1 carina nebula region ( table  [ tab_imf ] case ( 1 ) ) and the imf of the members - only can be considered as a lower limit ( table  [ tab_imf ] case ( 2 ) ) .",
    "if all stars in the pms locus , regardless of membership selection criteria , are used in the calculation , the imf may be overestimated due to field star contamination . to subtract the contribution of field stars",
    ", we should choose a control region representative of the field population toward the @xmath1 carina nebula .",
    "however , the choice of the field region is very difficult , especially for open clusters in the galactic plane .",
    "if we choose a region far from the nebula , the background population will be counted more than the nebula region . on the other hand ,",
    "the region near the @xmath1 carina nebula may represent both foreground and background populations , but faint halo members of the cluster may also be subtracted as part of the  foreground population \" .    in order to subtract the field contribution and compare the imf before and after the subtraction , we chose a small region in the nw part of the observed region .",
    "the region is shown in figure  [ plot ] ( @xmath103 r.a.@xmath156 , @xmath103 decl.@xmath157 ) .",
    "the location of the region coincides with the giant molecular cloud car i @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the bright arc in h@xmath158 is well matched with the curved edges of both @xmath159co and 3.3 @xmath160 m pah emission .",
    "these facts allow us to expect that star formation has not yet propagated into this region , and we can expect that no members of the @xmath1 carina nebula exist in the region . in addition , as the giant molecular cloud is very close to the @xmath1 carina nebula , stars found in this region should well represent the population of foreground stars .",
    "we re - calculated the slope of the imf , @xmath11 , after subtraction of the field contribution down to our observational limit ( table  [ tab_imf ] case ( 3 ) ) . however , as there was no significant difference from the slopes of the imf in table  [ tab_imf ] we conclude that the slope of imf , @xmath11 , is practically the same within the errors , with and without subtraction of the field contribution .",
    "the field contamination in the observed region has no serious influence on the slope of the imf .",
    "the imf of the @xmath1 carina nebula is very similar to that of ( @xmath161 ; @xcite ) , but is slightly shallower than the imf of the solar neighborhood , the pleiades , or ngc 2264 ( @xmath162 ; see figure 6 of @xcite ) .      the presence of the lbv ( @xmath1 carinae ) , wn7 ( hd 93162 ) , and several o3 stars indicates that both tr 14 and tr 16 are very young clusters .",
    "most previous estimates of age and age spread were based on stellar evolutionary models . @xcite estimated 1.5 myr for the most massive stars in tr 14 .",
    "@xcite estimated the age of both tr 14 and tr 16 to be 2  3 myr with an age spread of 5  6 myr for massive stars and 10 myr for low - mass pms stars .",
    "@xcite estimated 5 myr for tr 14 and 3  6 myr for tr 16 .",
    "most recently , @xcite estimated 2 myr for tr 14 and 5 myr for tr 16 .    in figure  [ hr ] , two isochrones interpolated from the stellar evolution models of @xcite",
    "are superimposed .",
    "hd 93128 ( o3.5v((f+ ) ) ) and hd 93129a ( o2if@xmath130 ) in tr 14 and hd 93205 ( o3.5v((f+ ) ) ) , hd 303308 ( o4v((f+ ) ) ) and i d 2022 ( = y398 , o3-o4if ) in tr 16 are very close to the zams and fit well to the 1 myr isochrone , while hd 93162 for the case of @xmath163 .",
    "if the effective temperature of @xcite and the luminosity corrected for the case of @xmath164 are applied , hd 93162 is much closer to the 1 myr isochrone in figure  [ hr ] . ]",
    "( wn7 ) in tr 16 is well fitted to the 2.5 myr isochrone .",
    "therefore , the age of massive ms stars in both clusters is about 1 myr .",
    "the age of evolved stars in tr 16 is about 2.5 myr but we can not estimate the upper limit of the age of tr 14 because there is no evolved star in the cluster .",
    "figure  [ age_pms ] shows the age distribution of pms stars in the clusters .",
    "the average age of pms members in both clusters are distributed between 1 myr and 3 myr .",
    "but , the age of the lower mass ( @xmath165 ) stars seems to be older than 1 myr , because the more luminous pms stars ( thus younger pms stars ) are preferentially detected due to our observational limit .",
    "on the other hand , the age of the massive pms stars ( @xmath166 ) is about 3 myr .",
    "these massive pms stars in both clusters appear to still be in the kelvin  helmholtz contraction phase .",
    "@xcite suggested that the age of pms stars in the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz contraction phase could be overestimated .",
    "later @xcite discussed the age of pms stars determined from pms models .",
    "it is not easy to determine the age difference between these clusters because the age distribution of both clusters seems to be very similar . in order to estimate the difference in ages of the pms stars in the clusters , deeper photometry down to sub - solar - mass stars",
    "is required .",
    "it is uncertain whether collinder 232 ( cr 232 ) , a poor young cluster with a small number of blue stars , located to the eastern side of tr 14 is a separate cluster or an extended part of tr 14 .",
    "there are a few very early - type stars , including hd 93250 ( o3.5v((f+ ) ) ) and hd 303311 ( o5v ) , that are thought to be members of cr 232 together with other proper motion members , but this simply suggests that the stars are at the same distance and have similar kinematic properties to tr 14 and tr 16 .",
    "the existence of o3.5v((f+ ) ) stars in cr 232 ( hd 93250 ) and tr 14 ( hd 93128 ) also implies that the two clusters are indistinguishable in age .",
    "previous studies have argued that cr 232 may not be an independent cluster .",
    "@xcite concluded that cr 232 appears not to be a real cluster ( see figure 13 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested that cr 232 could be an extended part of tr 14 rather than an independent cluster .",
    "we agree with these conclusions and have treated cr 232 as an outer region of tr 14 and tr 16 rather than a separate cluster .",
    "we have presented new @xmath0 photometric data down to @xmath24 for tr 14 and tr 16 obtained with the 1 m telescope at siding spring observatory and a site 2k ccd camera .",
    "we selected the members and candidates using the x - ray source catalog from _ chandra _ x - ray observations provided by @xcite and the cccp x - ray point - source catalog provided by @xcite , the 2mass point - source catalog , and the membership probability from the proper motion study of @xcite .",
    "we derived an abnormal reddening law in the @xmath1 carina nebula and determined the foreground reddening to be @xmath87 mag .",
    "an abnormal total - to - selective extinction ratio in the nebula , @xmath2 , was determined using 141 early - type members .",
    "we derived the same distance modulus of @xmath4 mag ( @xmath167 kpc ) for both tr 14 and tr 16 , and concluded that the clusters are at the same distance .",
    "we derived the imf and calculated the slope @xmath6 for the @xmath1 carina nebula region down to our observational limit ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the slope of the imf , @xmath11 , of the @xmath1 carina nebula is very similar to that of ngc 6231 and is slightly shallower than that of ngc 2264 , the solar neighborhood , and the pleiades .",
    "we estimated the age of ms stars in both clusters to be about 1 myr from the comparison between the theoretical evolution models and the h - r diagram of the cluster .",
    "the more evolved star hd 93162 in tr 16 is matched well with the isochrone of age 2.5 myr .",
    "we have also estimated the age of the pms stars in the @xmath1 carina nebula to be 1  3 myr .",
