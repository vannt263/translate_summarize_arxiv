    "the normal component of the relative velocity after a collision @xmath6 follows from that before the collision @xmath7 via    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are respectively the velocities before and after the collision , while the unit vector @xmath13 gives the direction of the inter - particle vector @xmath14 at the instant of the collision .    from experiments as well as from theory it is well known that the coefficient of normal restitution @xmath0 is not a constant but it depends sensitively on the impact velocity @xcite .",
    "although most of the results in the field of granular gases have been derived neglecting this dependence but using a velocity - independent coefficient of restitution ( e.g.  @xcite ) it has been shown that the impact - velocity dependence of the coefficient of restitution has serious consequences for various problems in granular gas dynamics @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for inelastically colliding 3d - spheres has been addressed in @xcite , where the hertz contact law @xcite @xmath15 for the elastic inter - particle force has been extended to account for the viscoelasticity of the material which causes the dissipative part of the force @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the compression of the particles during the collision @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the radii and the positions of the spheres ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the young modulus and the poisson ratio of the particle material , @xmath25 , and the dissipative parameter @xmath26 reads @xcite    @xmath27\\,.\\ ] ]    the viscous constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 relate the dissipative stress tensor to the deformation rate tensor @xcite . the same functional dependence of @xmath30 has been obtained in @xcite using a different approach .",
    "the equation of motion for inelastically colliding spheres reads , therefore , @xmath31 and with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the masses of the colliding particles ) . to obtain the dependence of the restitution coefficient on the impact velocity for 3d - spheres the equation of motion ( [ eomotion ] )",

    "although in @xcite a general method of derivation of _ all _ coefficients of the expansion ( [ epsilon ] ) has been proposed , to obtain these , extensive calculations have to be performed",
    ". this approach does not provide closed - form expressions for the coefficients , but rather gives them in terms of convergent series which are to be evaluated up to the desired precision .    in the present study",
    "we show that a dimension analysis allows to obtain the functional form of the @xmath5-dependence for the elastic and dissipative forces . within the framework of this analysis",
    "we reproduce the dependence ( [ epsilon ] ) up to numerical values of coefficients @xmath39 .",
    "a similar approach has been used by tanaka et al . @xcite to prove that the constant coefficient of restitution is not consistent with physical reality",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we also develop a simple approximative theory , which gives a continuum fraction representation for @xmath5 and a closed - form expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the same numerical values as above .",
    "using then coefficients @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 and @xmath44 evaluated in appendix in accordance with the general scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite ) we construct a pad - approximation , which reproduces fairly well the experimental data for colliding ice - particles @xcite .",
    "to perform the general dimensional analysis we adopt the following form for the elastic and dissipative forces :    @xmath45    this general form ( at least for small @xmath17 and @xmath46 ) follows from the fact that both elastic and dissipative forces vanish at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . with these notations",
    "the equation of motion for colliding particles reads @xmath49 where @xmath1 has already been introduced .",
    "now we choose as the characteristic length @xmath50 of the problem the maximal compression for the elastic case .",
    "it may be found from the condition that the initial kinetic energy @xmath51 @xcite equals the maximal elastic energy @xmath52 , which yields @xmath53 choosing then the characteristic time of the problem as @xmath54 , we construct new dimensionless variables @xmath55 and recast the equation of motion into dimensionless form :    @xmath56    in the last eq .",
    "( [ dimles ] ) we supplemented the pre - collisional initial conditions at @xmath57 with the after - collisional conditions at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is the dimensionless time and @xmath60 is the dimensionless duration of the collision ) .",
    "these follow just from the definition of the restitution coefficient .",
    "we point out that all dependence on the initial impact velocity on any quantity of the problem , including @xmath0 ( this is just the dimensionless after - collisional velocity ) comes only through the constant @xmath61 , which reads @xmath62 hence , @xmath63 .",
    "a similar result for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the restitution coefficient does not depend on the impact velocity @xmath1 then follows    @xmath67    for a linear dependence of the dissipative force on the velocity , i.e. for @xmath65 ( this seems to be the most realistic for small @xmath46 ) one obtains a constant restitution coefficient for    * the linear elastic force , @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 . the condition ( [ condition ] ) implies @xmath70 , and thus the linear dissipative force @xmath71 .",
    "* the hertz law for 3d - spheres ( [ hertzlaw ] ) @xmath72 , therefore @xmath73 and @xmath74 provides a constant restitution coefficient .",
    "we now ask the question : what kind of @xmath5 dependence corresponds to the forces which act during collisions of viscoelastic particles ?",
    "it may be generally shown @xcite that the relation    @xmath75    between the dissipative and elastic forces with the dissipative constant @xmath26 given in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) holds , provided three conditions are met  @xcite :    1 .",
    "the elastic part of the stress tensor depends linearly on the deformation tensor  @xcite .",
    "2 .   the dissipative part of the stress tensor depends linearly on the deformation rate tensor  @xcite .",
    "the conditions of quasistatic motion are provided , i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath77 @xcite ( here @xmath78 is the speed of sound in the material of particles , @xmath79 is relaxation time of viscous processes in its bulk ) .    from this",
    "follows that @xmath65 , @xmath80 , and thus the constant restitution coefficient may be observed only for collisions of cubic particles with surfaces normal to the direction of collision .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this conclusion comes from the general analysis of viscoelastic collisions .",
    "let us discuss now collisions between spheres with elastic and dissipative forces as given by ( [ hertzlaw ] ) and ( [ disslaw ] ) , respectively .",
    "for these we have @xmath81 , @xmath72 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath65 which yields the functional dependence for @xmath84 and @xmath5 respectively :    @xmath85    ( skipping the prefactor of @xmath84 in the last equation ) in accordance with ( [ epsilon ] ) as found previously .",
    "using @xmath86 it is convenient to write the equation of motion for a collision in the form @xmath87 where we introduce the mechanical energy @xmath88 to find the energy losses in the first stage of the collision , which starts with zero compression and ends in the turning point with maximal compression @xmath89 @xmath90 one needs to know the dependence of the compression rate @xmath91 as a function of the compression @xmath92 .    for the case of elastic collisions , the maximal compression is @xmath93 , according to the definition of our dimensionless variables .",
    "hence , the dependence @xmath94 follows from the conservation of energy : @xmath95 the velocity @xmath91 vanishes at the turning point @xmath96 .",
    "for inelastic collisions the maximal compression @xmath89 is smaller than @xmath97 , therefore , one can write an approximation relation for the inelastic case : @xmath98 which also gives vanishing velocity @xmath91 at the turning point @xmath89 . integration in eq .",

    ", it is characterized by a negative damping ( the energy `` is pumped '' into the system during the collision ) .",
    "the maximal compression @xmath89 is the same in both collisions , the direct and the inverse .",
    "rescaling equation of motion for the inverse collision in the very same way as for the direct collision yields    @xmath104    this suggests the following approximative relation for @xmath94 during the inverse collision :    @xmath105    with the additional prefactor @xmath0 , which is the initial velocity in the inverse collision .",

    "it is convenient to return to dimensional units .",

    "we conclude that our simple approximative theory reproduces exactly the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath124 , which were found before using extensive analysis @xcite .",
    "we also performed rigorous but elaborated calculations according to the general scheme of @xcite to find the exact coefficients ( details are given in the appendix ) @xmath125 or , respectively , @xmath126 hence , we observe that while the first two coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath121 are correctly obtained from the approximative theory , the next approximated coefficients @xmath127 , @xmath128 differ from the exact ones .    for practical applications such as molecular dynamics simulations , however ,",

    "there is a certain probability that the relative velocity @xmath1 of colliding particles exceeds the limit of applicability of ( [ eqforeps2x ] ) .",
    "therefore , we use the obtained coefficients to construct a pad - approximation for @xmath5 which reveals the correct limits of the boundary conditions , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . since the dependence @xmath5 is expected to be a smooth , monotonically decreasing function , we choose a `` 1 - 4 '' pad - approximation @xmath132 standard analysis yields the coefficients @xmath133 in terms of the coefficients @xmath134 @xcite ( see table  [ tab : tab ] )",

    "the discrepancy with the experimental data at small @xmath1 follows from the fact that the extrapolation expression , @xmath136 used in @xcite has an unphysical divergence at @xmath137 and does not imply the fail of the theory for this region .",
    "the scattering of the experimental data presented in @xcite is large for small impact velocity according to experimental complications , hence the fit formula of @xcite can not be expected to be accurate enough for too small velocities .",
    "moreover in the region of very small velocity possibly other than viscoelastic interactions influence the collision behavior , e.g. adhesion .",
    "we developed a dimensional analysis for the inelastic collision of spherical particles .",
    "we could show that for 3d - spheres the functional form for @xmath5 agrees with that derived previously @xcite using a much more complicated approach . using a simple approximative theory we found a continuum - fraction representation for @xmath5 and obtained explicit expressions for the coefficients of the series expansion of the restitution coefficient in terms of the impact velocity .",

    "it reproduces fairly well the experimental data for colliding ice particles .",
    "the obtained relation for the restitution coefficient may be used for a wide range of the impact velocities , provided that the energy loss during a collision is attributed to viscoelasticity and that all the other dissipative processes ( plastic deformation , fragmentation of particles ) may be ignored .",
