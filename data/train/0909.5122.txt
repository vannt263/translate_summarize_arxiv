    "chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking in the vacuum are key ingredients to our understanding of the phase structure of strongly interacting matter at non - zero temperature and vanishing baryon chemical potential . in the limit of @xmath6 massless",
    "quark flavors the qcd phase transition is controlled by the @xmath7 chiral symmetry .",
    "quite general renormalization group arguments suggest @xcite that qcd with three degenerate light quark flavors has a first order phase transition , whereas the 2-flavor theory is expected to have a second order phase transition . in the latter case",
    "the @xmath8 chiral symmetry is isomorphic to @xmath9 and the transition therefore is expected to belong to the same universality class as 3-dimensional , @xmath9 symmetric spin models .",
    "depending on the value of the strange quark mass the qcd phase transition in the limit of vanishing light quark masses ( up , down ) may be first order or a continuous transition still belonging to the 3-dimensional , @xmath9 universality class @xcite .",
    "while numerical calculations in 3-flavor qcd gave evidence for the existence of a first order transition , many of the details of the transition in 2- or ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd with light up and down quarks are still poorly constrained through lattice calculations .",
    "in particular , we do not know whether the chiral phase transition in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd is first or second order .",
    "an answer to this question is not only of academic interest ; it also greatly influences our thinking about the phase diagram of qcd at non - zero baryon chemical potential @xcite . the present analysis ,",
    "although still performed on rather coarse lattices , is a first step towards answering this question .",
    "attempts to verify the universal critical behavior associated with the qcd chiral phase transition in 2-flavor qcd have been made already before in calculations with staggered @xcite and wilson @xcite fermions .",
    "none of these lattice discretization schemes for the fermion sector of qcd preserve the full chiral @xmath9 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "it therefore may not be too surprising that the early attempts to verify universal scaling properties of qcd were not too successful .",
    "in fact , at non - zero lattice spacing the wilson fermion formulation does not preserve any continuous symmetry related to the chiral sector of qcd .",
    "the staggered formulation preserves at least an @xmath10 symmetry at non - zero lattice spacing that gives rise to a single massless goldstone mode in the chiral limit .",
    "nevertheless , direct determinations of critical exponents within the staggered discretization scheme @xcite did not deliver the expected @xmath4 results .",
    "of course , due to the explicit breaking of @xmath9 symmetry in the staggered formalism at non - vanishing lattice spacing one would not have expected to be sensitive to @xmath9 scaling .",
    "however , @xmath9 and @xmath10 critical exponents are quite similar and one thus might have hoped to observe at least some _ generic evidence for @xmath4 scaling _ symmetry .",
    "the relevant symmetry of qcd in the continuum limit , on the other hand , is expected to be @xmath9 . for many aspects of the discussion of critical behavior presented here ,",
    "the distinction between @xmath10 and @xmath9 is of no importance . in these cases we will generically talk about @xmath4 symmetric models . ] .    in the same spirit , the magnetic equation of state , _",
    "i.e. _ the scaling of the chiral order parameter as function of reduced temperature and quark mass , has been analyzed subsequently in calculations with staggered @xcite and wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "the studies performed with wilson fermions gave some indication for @xmath9 scaling .",
    "these calculations , however , had been constrained to the high temperature , symmetry restored phase and had been performed with rather large values of the quark mass .",
    "they therefore did not allow to perform a test of scaling in the symmetry broken phase and could not contribute to the question of how goldstone modes influence the scaling behavior at low temperatures .",
    "this contribution of goldstone modes is a prominent feature of the magnetic equation of state of @xmath4 symmetric theories which has been analyzed in detail in @xmath4 symmetric spin models @xcite . in the case of staggered fermions",
    "one might have hoped to find at least evidence for @xmath10 scaling scaling has been found in calculations with a massless staggered fermion action to which an irrelevant chiral 4-fermion interaction has been added @xcite . ] .",
    "in fact , not only critical exponents , but also the @xmath10 and @xmath9 magnetic equations of state are quite similar .",
    "deviations from the scaling function , however , turned out to be large in the low as well as high temperature regions and even in calculations on lattices with rather small lattice spacings @xcite .",
    "the missing evidence for @xmath4 scaling also left room for an interpretation of the scaling behavior of 2-flavor qcd in terms of a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "we will present here results from calculations with staggered fermions .",
    "contrary to most earlier studies of scaling properties these calculations have been performed with an action that suppresses cut - off effects induced by a non - zero lattice spacing ( @xmath11 ) in finite temperature calculations .",
    "thermodynamic quantities are @xmath12 improved .",
    "a first analysis of goldstone effects with this action has been performed for rather large quark masses in ref .",
    "our calculations have been carried out with smaller than physical light quark masses so that the lightest goldstone mode is a factor two lighter than the physical value of the pion mass .",
    "this will allow us to address the basic features of the thermodynamics induced by goldstone modes and to gain some control over the universal features in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition temperature .",
    "we will present numerical evidence that at finite temperature , in the symmetry broken phase , the dominant quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate arises from fluctuations of the goldstone modes that lead to a square root dependence of the condensate on the light quark masses .",
    "such a behavior is expected in 3-dimensional theories with global @xmath4 symmetry @xcite .",
    "we will also show that universal scaling properties of the condensate are consistent with the 3-dimensional @xmath4 universality class .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of scaling violations , induced by the regular part of the qcd partition function , suggests that the crossover transition in qcd with physical quark masses is already strongly influenced by contributions arising from the singular universal part of the qcd partition function . at present",
    "we are not sensitive to differences between @xmath10 and @xmath9 scaling .",
    "however , we point out that a combined analysis of scaling functions for the order parameter and its susceptibility should provide unambiguous results on the universality class of the chiral transition in qcd .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize universal properties of 3-dimensional @xmath10 and @xmath9 symmetric spin models and introduce notations . in section iii we present our data on the quark mass and temperature dependence of chiral condensates in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd .",
    "the main results on the magnetic equation of state are discussed in section iv . in section",
    "v we give a brief account of properties of susceptibilities of the chiral order parameter .",
    "section vi contains our conclusions . in appendix [ app.scaling ] ,",
    "for the readers convenience we compile the asymptotic forms and the interpolations used for the @xmath10 and @xmath9 scaling functions , as adopted from @xcite . the numerical data which this paper is based on are summarized in appendix [ app.data ] .",
    "in the limit of vanishing light quark masses qcd is expected to undergo a phase transition at some critical temperature @xmath13 at which chiral symmetry gets restored .",
    "the light quark chiral condensate , @xmath14 , will vanish at this temperature .",
    "its quark mass and temperature dependence in the vicinity of the critical point , @xmath15 , is controlled by a scaling function that arises from the singular part of the partition function .",
    "one way of analyzing the non - analytic structure of the qcd partition function , which has been pursued in the past , is to study the so - called magnetic equation of state . before continuing our discussion of critical behavior in qcd",
    "we briefly summarize basic scaling relations using the conventional spin model notation , where the order parameter is denoted by @xmath16 and the symmetry breaking field is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the critical behavior of @xmath10 and @xmath9 spin models in three dimensions has been analyzed extensively in the past .",
    "we will follow here closely the discussion given in @xcite .      in the vicinity of a critical point regular contributions to the partition functions become negligible and the universal critical behavior of the order parameter @xmath16 of , e.g. 3-dimensional @xmath4 spin models ,",
    "is controlled by a scaling function @xmath18 that arises from the singular part of the logarithm of the partition function , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and scaling variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 that are related to the temperature , @xmath23 , and the symmetry breaking ( magnetic ) field , @xmath17 , @xmath24 here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are critical exponents characterizing the approach of the order parameter @xmath16 to the critical point when one of the scaling variables is set to zero , @xmath27 these relations also fix the normalization of the scaling variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ they define the normalization constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 introduced in eq .  [ reduced ] .",
    "equivalently one can fix @xmath28 and @xmath29 through normalization conditions for the scaling function @xmath18 , @xmath30 as it is of some relevance for our later discussion we note here that the normalization conditions for the scaling function , @xmath18 , which fix the scale parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , refer to values of the scaling variable @xmath31 , that are infinitely apart .    for @xmath4 symmetric spin models in three dimensions the scaling functions have been analyzed in much detail using monte carlo simulations and renormalization group techniques . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] we show results for the @xmath10  @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite scaling functions obtained by using the implicit parametrizations given in ref .",
    "@xcite and compiled in appendix  [ app.scaling ] .",
    "there are clear differences between both scaling functions .",
    "we note , however , that the manifestation of the differences between the @xmath10 and @xmath9 scaling functions in the limited range @xmath32 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] relies also on the normalization of these scaling functions in the limit @xmath33 . without information on the scaling function at @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e. _ in a numerical study that only has access to a limited range of @xmath31-values , the scale parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 could easily be adjusted to make the @xmath10 and @xmath9 scaling functions almost coincide . for @xmath32",
    "this is shown by the crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] which have been obtained by rescaling the argument of the @xmath9 scaling function , @xmath35 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ through a change of @xmath36 by 20% in this interval . this will lead to a violation of the normalization condition at @xmath37 by a factor @xmath38 , for the @xmath9 scaling function .",
    "the above discussion makes it evident that a numerical analysis of the magnetic equation of state alone , in a scaling regime as large as @xmath32 , will not allow to distinguish @xmath10 scaling from @xmath9 scaling , unless the numerical accuracy is extraordinary high .",
    "additional information will be needed to distinguish @xmath10 from @xmath9 scaling .",
    "this can be achieved through accurate control over the chiral limit , @xmath37 , or through the analysis of other scaling functions like the scaling function , @xmath39 , for the susceptibility of the order parameter , @xmath40 this scaling function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling](right ) .",
    "it has a maximum at @xmath41 which together with some critical exponents of the @xmath4 models is given in table  [ tab : parameter ] .",
    "it is obvious from this figure that a simple rescaling of the scale parameter @xmath31 can not transform an @xmath10 scaling function into that for @xmath9 .",
    "while different @xmath4 symmetric models are characterized by universal scaling functions , the scaling variables have to be normalized properly .",
    "the scale parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not universal .",
    "they depend on the @xmath4 symmetric model under consideration , the definition of the scaling variables and also on the absolute normalization of the order parameter @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , a rescaling of the order parameter by a constant factor , @xmath42 , can be absorbed in a redefinition of the normalization constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this leaves the argument @xmath31 of the scaling function and the scaling function itself unchanged , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for a given definition of the symmetry breaking field @xmath17",
    "the combination @xmath47 therefore remains unchanged and is unique for any @xmath4 symmetric model , _",
    "i.e. _ its value is characteristic for that theory .",
    "it , for instance , characterizes the @xmath17-dependence of the pseudo - critical line of transition temperatures , @xmath48 , determined from the peak position of the order parameter susceptibility , @xmath49 in section iv we will determine the corresponding scaling relation for the pseudo - critical line of ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd from an analysis of the magnetic equation of state .",
