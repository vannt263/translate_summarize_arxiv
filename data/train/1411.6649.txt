    ". then the main result of this paper is that in the forward barrier sense @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a time - dependent constant that only depends on the topology of @xmath4 and the geometry of @xmath23 with respect to the metric @xmath24 in a controlled way .",
    "we refer to proposition [ prop : areaevolutioninmm ] for more details . in @xcite , the result of this paper",
    "will be applied to simplicial complexes @xmath4 and maps @xmath6 as constructed in @xcite to prove a conjecture of perelman .    consider for a moment the case in which @xmath4 is a compact surface , possibly with boundary . in this case",
    "the estimate ( [ eq : approximateresultevolutionofa ] ) is known , or at least folklore .",
    "it follows from an argument due to hamilton ( cf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec 11 ) ) , which makes use of the fact that for every time @xmath12 $ ] we can choose a time-@xmath14 minimal map @xmath25 whose area is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the argument also makes use of the gau - codazzi equations and the theorem of gau - bonnet .",
    "so for example , in the case in which @xmath4 is closed , the constant @xmath22 becomes @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the euler characteristic of @xmath4 .",
    "we remark that even in the surface case hamilton s argument is not quite sufficient for our particular setting , since we can not exclude the existence of branch points , i.e. we can not guarantee that the minimal map @xmath29 is an immersion .",
    "this issue can however be overcome as we demonstrate in proposition [ prop : evolminsurfgeneral ] below , where we will establish the case in which @xmath4 is a disk .",
    "consider the general case in which @xmath4 is a simplicial complex .",
    "an inspection of the arguments described in the previous paragraph shows that if the existence of an area minimizing map @xmath25 is guaranteed , then all of hamilton s estimates can be carried out .",
    "here we have to make use of the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath29 along the edges of @xmath4 , which state that around every edge the faces meet in directions that add up to zero .",
    "this additional set of equations implies that certain boundary integrals arising in the application of gau - bonnet cancel each other out .",
    "unfortunately , an existence and regularity theory for such minimizers @xmath29 does not exist to the author s knowledge and seems to be difficult to achieve .",
    "we note that , however , if we allow the combinatorial structure of @xmath4 to vary , then a result of choe ( cf @xcite)which relies heavily on this fact  states : for every riemannian metric @xmath30 on @xmath1 , there is a finite , 2-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath31 and a smooth , minimal embedding @xmath32 such that the complement of @xmath33 is a topological ball .",
    "such embeddings maps would be interesting in the final part @xcite or our series , but it seems to be difficult to control the number of vertices of @xmath31 and this number influences the bound @xmath22 in the area evolution estimate of @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , it is very likely that there are metrics @xmath35 on @xmath1 for which the number of vertices of the corresponding minimal simplicial complex @xmath36 diverges .    in order to get around this issue",
    ", we will employ the following trick . instead of looking for a minimizer of the area functional , we will find a minimizer of the perturbed functional @xmath37 here",
    "@xmath38 is a small constant , @xmath39 denotes the sum of the lengths of @xmath40 restricted to all edges of @xmath4 and @xmath41 is any map that is homotopic to @xmath6 .",
    "the existence and regularity of a minimizer for the perturbed functional follows now easily ( apart from some issues arising from possible self - intersections of the @xmath42-skeleton ) .",
    "however , the extra term @xmath43 introduces an extra term in the euler - lagrange equations along each edge of @xmath4 and hence the boundary integrals in the evolution estimate for the minimum of this perturbed functional will not cancel each other out , but add up to a new term .",
    "luckily , it will turn out that this term has the right sign to derive an evolution estimate similar to ( [ eq : approximateresultevolutionofa ] ) . now letting @xmath44 go to @xmath45 , we obtain the desired evolution estimate for @xmath34 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : spheresanddisks ] we present hamilton s area estimate for spheres ( see proposition [ prop : evolsphere ] ) and for disks ( see prop [ prop : evolminsurfgeneral ] ) .",
    "both of these estimates will be needed in @xcite . for spheres ,",
    "hamilton s argument is straight forward and the computations in this case exhibit the idea underlying the subsequent area estimates very clearly . for disks ,",
    "an issue arises due to possible branch points , which can be resolved by a trick . in section [ sec : defpolygonalcomplex ]",
    "we define simplicial complexes and section [ sec : existenceofvminimizers ] contains the existence and regularity discussion for maps from simplicial complexes that minimize the perturbed area functional ( [ eq : perturbedareafunctionalinintro ] ) .",
    "the results of this section will then be used in section [ sec : areaevolutionunderrf ] to derive the infimal area evolution estimate for simplicial complexes , i.e. the bound ( [ eq : approximateresultevolutionofa ] ) . proposition [ prop : areaevolutioninmm ] in that section will be our main result .",
    "we note that sections [ sec : defpolygonalcomplex]-[sec : areaevolutionunderrf ] are independent of section [ sec : spheresanddisks ] .",
    "observe that most results in this paper will be phrased in terms of ricci flows with surgery and precise cutoff @xmath46 as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that we want to apply these results without change in @xcite .",
    "however , the possible existence of surgeries is inessential and does not create any issues .",
    "for the purposes of this paper it is only important to be familiar with properties ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) of the definition of ricci flows with surgery and precise cutoff ( see ( * ? ? ? * definition [ def : precisecutoff ] ) ) .",
    "property ( 1 ) ensures that we have the bound @xmath47 for all times @xmath14 . and",
    "property ( 5 ) implies that areas can not increase by a trivial surgery .",
    "specifically this property implies that for every surgery time @xmath48 whose surgeries are all trivial and every @xmath49 there is some @xmath50 such that for all @xmath51 there is a @xmath52-lipschitz map @xmath53 that is equal to the identity on the part of the manifold that is not affected by the surgery process at time @xmath48 .",
    "we will be able to conclude from this property that quantities of the type @xmath26 are lower semi - continuous in time .",

    "in this subsection we recall area estimates for minimal spheres and disks under ricci flow . they were first developed by hamilton ( ( * ? ? ? * sec 11 ) ) .",
