    "one of the most general and successful concepts in physics is the separation of a physical system into a simpler , controlled subsystem that is interacting with a perturbing subsystem .",

    "moreover , the @xmath2 fermi - polaron system was shown to undergo a transition of its own , featuring as possible ground states@xcite a polaronic spin-1/2 quasiparticle and the composite spin-0 molecule , consisting of the impurity and a single bath atom . however",
    ", this transition does not generalize easily to population - imbalanced fermi gases as it might be preempted by phase separation .",
    "two of the most common approaches to the fermi - polaron problem are variational anstze and the use of an approximate diagrammatic technique@xcite .",
    "these methods are able to calculate key quasiparticle properties , e.g. , effective mass or polaron residue and helped to map the transition between polaronic and molecular states .",

    ", they managed to reach sufficiently high expansion orders allowing them to extract energies and effective masses in very good agreement with other techniques despite the fermionic sign problem .",
    "recently , the method was used@xcite for the extraction of polaron quasiparticle residues and two - dimensional geometries .    up to now , these diagmc implementations have only been applied to the special case of equal masses of impurity and bath atoms .",

    "no seeding is necessary , all bath momenta are purely swapped or added . determining final times",

    "in addition to the modifications of the bare code , we propose some changes only affecting the bold diagrammatic monte carlo routine .",
    "using full green s functions as self - consistent input has the disadvantage of increasing sampling space drastically by forcing the tabulation of the full green s function in both imaginary time and momentum .",
    "it is therefore beneficial to use the fact that first - order contributions dominate the fully bold propagator and construct a partially bold diagrammatic series out of quantities that are easily tabulated .",
    "it is possible to put the analytically known first - order self - energy into dyson s equation in matsubara frequency space to obtain the first - order green s function .",
    "a fourier transform yields the basic propagator @xmath67 without stochastic errors . only a few modifications are necessary to adjust the basic monte carlo routine : first , every diagram containing at least one first - order self - energy diagram ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : fake ] ) has to be excluded from measurements .",
    "second , it is no longer forbidden to connect adjacent @xmath3 matrices , just as in fully bold code@xcite  the only difference is that the associated impurity weight is now @xmath27 .",

    "this extension is almost identical to the bold polaron code . linking @xmath3 matrices",
    "is readmitted with the same ( now non - artificial ) weight @xmath27 for impurity propagators .",
    "the only new feature concerns the first - order molecule diagram that is now sampled and has to be calculated with impurity weight @xmath27 . by this means , the ultraviolet divergence is cured and a second , independent molecule series is constructed which helps confirming robustness and reproducibility of the results .",
    "resummation is still needed for this new series .    as a last comment on bold sampling",
    ", we would like to draw attention to the flaws of bold diagmc .",
    "first , if the dyson series is not absolutely convergent , the rearrangement of this series into the fully or partially bold series is potentially harmful , as it constitutes a ( though physically motivated ) regrouping of terms which can yield any result for non - convergent series@xcite .",
    "second , many series in quantum field theory are asymptotic expansions , implying that results begin to get better and better with increasing expansion order until some maximum expansion order @xmath68 is reached , after which the factorial growth of the number of diagrams leads to huge oscillations .",
    "in such a case , using a bare series is a common procedure , whereas the bold approach captures diagrams of higher order from the start . summarizing this line of argument",
    ", a bold diagrammatic approach seems only reasonable if the underlying series is convergent .",

    "( color online ) resummation methods of type riesz with different exponents @xmath69 applied to the modified bare series ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : resum ] ) are compared at unitarity in a three - dimensional setup .",
    "the plot shows polaron energies depending on maximum sampling order . ]",
    "as diagrammatic expansions are in general not absolutely convergent , an important tool to study the underlying series is resummation@xcite .",
    "this resummation procedure requires a discussion in more detail .",
    "typically we find the molecular energies to be stable , but the polaron energies in the bose - einstein - condensate limit are harder .",
    "sharp resummations are potentially dangerous if the maximum sampling order is not high enough as can be seen as follows : with a strong resummation method , the produced curve is almost flat for low expansion orders and then bends down sharply for higher orders .",
    "weak resummation methods on the other hand have more curvature for low expansion orders and flatten off if the order of divergence of the series is weak enough .",
    "there is thus a risk with strong resummation methods if only low expansion orders can be reached in the sense that a possibly strong curvature is missed , resulting in an apparently converging but wrongly extrapolated result in close vicinity to the first - order result .",
    "this effect is demonstrated@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : resummationconventional ] at unitarity .",
    "note that the bare series is monotonously decreasing which makes a high maximum resummation order necessary to extract the correct answer . summing it up : the more sign - alternating the bare series is , the better resummation works .",
    "a typical resummation method is the riesz resummation method .",
    "these resummations will act upon self - energy series which can be written as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 contains all contributions of diagrams of order @xmath29 .",
    "the order of a self - energy diagram is defined as the number of interaction @xmath3 matrices .",
    "the resummed self - energy series @xmath72 for some given maximum order @xmath73 is defined@xcite as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is given by the riesz coefficients @xmath76 @xmath69 fixes the strength of the resummation : for @xmath77 , no resummation is performed at all , while only the first - order contribution is maintained in the limit @xmath78 . if this method is used on molecular series , it might be beneficial to set @xmath79 as this ensures that the first contributing diagram ( which is of second order for molecules ) always contributes with full weight .",
    "we introduce a regrouping technique which seems to saturate much faster .",
    "provided the series is absolutely convergent , this is always allowed .",
    "it is based on a regrouping of terms in the bare series in such a way that sign - alternation is maximized .",
    "the technique consists in splitting @xmath71 , the self - energy contributions of order @xmath29 , into two parts : @xmath80 where @xmath81 collects all diagrams containing at least one @xmath3 matrix linked by a hole to itself , cf .",
    "[ fig : fake ] , and @xmath82 gathers the rest .",
    "we propose a new series @xmath83 which aims to maximize sign - alternation in @xmath84 .",
    "the coefficients in the resummation procedure depend on the expansion order for @xmath85 as @xmath86 these coefficients are in principle arbitrary  our choice was designed to show fast saturation as can be seen in fig .  [ fig : resummationnewunitarity ] for the case of the fermi - polaron at unitarity : the application of conventional riesz resummations on the reordered series illustrates that the manually implemented oscillations make it possible to read off polaron energies reliably and allow for a clear statement whether the expansion order is high enough or not . when reverting the roles of reducible and irreducible in eq .",
    "[ eq : resum ] , the same answer can be found but only after a stronger resummation .",
    "note that although the sum of diagrams of a specific order of the unitary polaron series is vanishing within error bars , the different terms are not small .    as the regrouped series agrees with the results of the standard bare series",

    "altogether , the phase diagram of ref .   can be expected to be nearly quantitatively exact . nevertheless ,",
    "as the polaron phase is underestimated , it will be shifted into the molecular sector . as this will reduce the small size of the nonzero - momentum molecular phase ( labeled as fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov phase , fflo ) further , it remains open whether this phase really exists .",

    "an additional regrouping technique was presented to speed up extrapolation to infinite diagram order for absolutely convergent series . while the first - order variational ansatz could give qualitative and quantitative good results for the polaron energy at different polaron masses , discrepancies are more pronounced for the polaron residue . for this quantity ,",

    "an important feature of @xmath153 is the dependence on the riesz exponent .",
    "this ensures that a stronger resummation results in a bigger error bar due to extrapolation errors . the fit @xmath153 can also be used for bare data ( @xmath77 ) . in this case",
    ", we replace @xmath69 by -1 in eq .",
    "[ fitting ] . note that the error bars represent a variability of results due to systematic origins corresponding to the one-@xmath6-interval .",

    "[ fig : resummation2 ] uses a sharper resummation on the same data , demonstrating that the error bar increases with @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , it becomes clear that the weakest possible resummation procedure ( among the ones resulting in a monotonously decaying series ) should be applied . as a final example",
    ", we show our resummation for a polaron point inside the quasi - two - dimensional transition region in  fig .",
    "[ fig : resummation3 ] . here ,",
    "resummation with @xmath152 is too weak , so @xmath116 has to be used , resulting in a stronger curvature .",
    "it is important to stress that these two extrapolations represent assumed worst - case scenarios .",
    "finally , as always for diagmc , the extrapolation result has to be checked with available experimental or theoretical results , thus justifying its application in retrospect . in our case",
    ", these results would be variational 2-ph results which we expect to be quantitatively exact .",

    "22 of ref .  .    for molecular energies",

    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : resummation4 ] : the last four points are well fit by a straight line",
