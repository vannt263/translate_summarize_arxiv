    "in cryoelectron microscopy , unstained biological specimens are rapidly vitrified at cryogenic temperatures @xcite . consequently",
    ", artefacts due to heavy - metal staining , desiccation , and other sample preparation processes are no longer an issue . however , the frozen , hydrated biological specimen , consisting mostly of light elements , scatters electrons weakly .",
    "hence biological specimens generally are weak phase objects associated with low image contrast @xcite . in this",
    "setting , the resolution is limited by radiation damage by the probe electrons @xcite to approximately 5 - 10 nm in the case of _ single _ objects @xcite .",
    "this leaves much to be desired because 2 nm resolution would be needed to identify molecules in frozen vitrified slices of the cell in cryoelectron tomography @xcite , or 0.8 nm resolution would be required to observe the secondary structure of a single protein molecule .",
    "the reason why radiation damage limits the resolution is that the safe electron dose , which does not cause sizable damage to the specimen , is so small that the low - contrast image is dominated by shot noise .",
    "shot noise is a manifestation of the particle nature of the electron and hence is fundamental .",
    "several approaches to address the radiation damage problem are known .",
    "first , methods based on averaging , such as two - dimensional crystallography @xcite and single - particle analysis @xcite , represent an established branch of methodology in structural biology . in favorable cases , these methods essentially attained atomic resolution @xcite .",
    "however , in order to average out the noise , this approach requires at least thousands of copies of the molecule of interest without much structural variance and hence is not suited for soft or unique objects .",
    "second , the advent of in - focus phase contrast electron microscopy @xcite enabled researchers to see weak phase objects much clearer than hitherto possible .",
    "the reason is that it provides a well - behaving phase contrast transfer function ( ctf ) that does not fall to zero at low resolutions and does not oscillate at high resolutions .",
    "however , this method does not go beyond the standard quantum limit , as will be mentioned .",
    "third and finally , the use of low acceleration voltage down to , e. g. 20 kv reduces radiation damage .",
    "in particular , one may choose the electron energy below the onset of relevant knock - on damage thresholds , although the dominant damage mechanism in biological cryoelectron microscopy is considered to be ionization events due to radiolysis @xcite .",
    "there have recently been much effort on developing aberration - corrected low - voltage transmission electron microscopes ( tems ) and scanning tems ( stems ) around the globe @xcite .",
    "while this approach certainly makes sense , the inelastic mean free path is considerably shorter at lower electron energies , necessitating preparation of ultra - thin specimens @xcite .",
    "while there have been reports of impressive images of _ thin _ biological molecules @xcite and organic molecules @xcite since decades ago , hydrated macromolecules of biological interest can have the size more than 50 nm .",
    "this makes it necessary to study thicker specimens and hence , if we insist on studying biologically interesting frozen hydrated macromolecules or vitrified slices of the cell , the use of a sufficiently high acceleration voltage is necessary .",
    "overall , these considerations suggest that no current electron microscopy method produces , in a robust and widely applicable manner , images of single hydrated objects of biological interest at a resolution below 2 nm .",
    "furthermore , phase measurement in all electron microscopy methods developed thus far , including all mentioned above , is governed by the shot noise limit , or in other words , the standard quantum limit . in this case",
    ", the precision @xmath0 of the measurement of the small phase shift @xmath1 , associated with the biological specimen , scales with the number of electrons @xmath2 as @xmath3 .    that the standard quantum limit can be beaten is well known in the field of quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "while the field has begun decades ago @xcite , a sizable fraction of recent activities in quantum metrology , mostly in the context of optics , revolves around the idea of employing entangled quantum states @xcite .",
    "in particular , measurement of a phase shift @xmath0 is a familiar objective in quantum metrology and it is relevant also to biological electron microscopy where weak phase objects are dealt with . a major question in quantum metrology is how the measurement precision @xmath0 varies with the amount of relevant resources @xmath2 . among others , query complexity emerged as one of the most useful resource count @xcite , which has been further elucidated and shown to be governed by the heisenberg limit @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "roughly , the number of queries equals the number of interactions with the entity to be measured .",
    "hence query complexity nicely captures the resource in biological electron microscopy , where the experimenter wants to get the most out of each query , which corresponds to passing of each electron in the specimen .",
    "it is worth noting here that , notwithstanding the recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite reports of beating the heisenberg limit , as long as the number of query is taken as the resource count , the heisenberg limit does represent the fundamental limit @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the heisenberg limit is by no means an easy target in real situations @xcite .",
    "it has increasingly been recognized that entanglement - assisted measurement is vulnerable to lossy processes and a number of recent studies address this problem @xcite .",
    "it is now established that quantum metrology , in lossy situations , offers merely a constant - factor improvement in the measurement precision , as opposed to the quadratic asymptotic improvement by a factor proportional to @xmath5 . nevertheless , a constant - factor improvement is all that we want in biological electron microscopy , or perhaps in any measurement for that matter .",
    "the real question is whether the value of the constant factor enables relevant specific resolutions , such as aforementioned 2 nm or 0.8 nm .",
    "this requires an analysis specific to biological cryoelectron microscopy , but in doing so , we may learn lessons of more general character .    on a related note , a recent work @xcite proposes an efficient multi - pixel phase estimation method that takes advantage of quantum entanglement .",
    "while interesting , the scheme employs a delocalized probe state over all the pixels and hence it is unlikely to be robust against localizing lossy processes , which occur in biological electron microscopy .    it should also be noted that , in general , beating the standard quantum limit does not necessarily require an entangled quantum state @xcite .",
    "repeated use of a probe particle would suffice . however , in the present case of entanglement - assisted biological electron microscopy , entangled quantum states are necessary for a somewhat mundane reason that the repeated use of an electron would result in too large a scattering angle to be handled by practical electron optics .",
    "the use of quantum advantage specifically in the context of biological electron microscopy has been discussed for some time now , albeit mostly from the theoretical perspective @xcite . in this paper",
    "we build on the recently proposed scheme that uses quantum entanglement between the probe electron and the cooper pair box ( cpb ) placed on an electron mirror @xcite .",
    "the scheme realizes what effectively amounts to multiparticle entanglement between the probe electrons , by way of sequential interactions between each electron and the cpb .",
    "a major objective of this paper is to investigate how and to what extent the effect of lossy processes may be mitigated in the proposed scheme .",
    "a distinct quantum approach @xcite to biological electron microscopy based on interaction - free measurement @xcite , also suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been proposed .",
    "while interesting , we note that there is certain limit associated to this type of approach @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review the entanglement - assisted electron microscopy scheme in sec . [",
    "sec : review - ent - em ] .",
    "this is followed by sec .",
    "[ sec : coherent errors ] , in which we deal with errors that is not related to lossy processes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : effect - of - inelastic ] , we study how inelastic scattering processes make adverse effects to the scheme .",
    "we also show that an appropriate design of the electron probe geometry enables us to combat this type of effect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "symbols @xmath6 respectively denotes the absolute value of the electron charge and the electron mass .",
    "a _ diffraction plane _ refers to any plane conjugate to the back focal plane of the objective lens .",
    "since aberration - corrected electron optics is becoming a commonplace , we generally neglect lens aberrations unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the probe electron energy is assumed to be @xmath7 throughout the paper .",
    "here we briefly review the microscope proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in part because we also want to fix notations @xcite .",
    "the scheme takes advantage of superconducting quantum electronics that includes a single cpb @xcite , presumably in the circuit quantum electrodynamics configuration @xcite .",
    "the microscope is designed to measure the difference @xmath8 of phase shifts @xmath9 and @xmath10 that are respectively associated with two regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the biological specimen , which generally is a weak phase object .",
    "multitude of such a measurement form an image . on the face of it , the shapes of the two regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 may be chosen arbitrarily : for example , they may be adjacent two small pixels , or it may be that @xmath11 surrounds a smaller region @xmath12 .",
    "however , we will find in the present work that the latter choice is much better .",
    "the cpb is placed on the surface of an electron mirror , which in turn is inserted between the pulsed electron gun and the condenser lens so that the electron emitted from the electron gun first interacts with the cpb before going to the specimen ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ent - asst - tem structure ] ) .",
    "we use only two states @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the cpb , that respectively denote quantum states of the cpb with zero or one excess cooper pair , where the subscript b stands for the word box. the main function of the electron mirror in this scheme is to modify the electron beam shape , depending on the charging state of the cpb : the electron mirror is designed in such a way that the beam trajectory is so sensitive to the cpb charge state that only a single cooper pair in the cpb is sufficient to direct the electron beam to the specimen region @xmath12 that would otherwise go to @xmath11 .",
    "the scattered electrons then go through more or less ordinary electron optics and are detected at a plane , which is not conjugate to the image plane , by an area detector with high quantum efficiency . alternatively , unlike the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , we will assume that the probe electrons are detected on a diffraction plane in the present work .",
    "in this case , it may well be possible to get rid of the objective lens ( ol ) and the projector lens system ( pls ) shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ent - asst - tem structure ] altogether , resulting in an instrument resembling the scanning tem ( stem ) .",
    "we mention several engineering challenges involved . a more complete discussion of most of what",
    "follows has been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are mainly five aspects that need to be developed .",
    "first , while the electron mirror has long history , an electron mirror that works at temperatures generated by the dilution refrigerator , i.e. a few tens of millikelvin , must be developed .",
    "second , a pulsed electron gun @xcite , with @xmath15 energy spread and ps pulse width , must be developed .",
    "each pulse may or may not contain an electron for the scheme to work .",
    "we note that @xmath15 energy spread has already been realized in the field of high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ( hreels ) where very low energy ( @xmath16 ) electrons are dealt with @xcite . in a similar fashion , the part of the electron optical system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent - asst - tem structure ] , consisting of the pulsed electron source , monochromator , electron beam separator and the electron mirror , controls electrons with such low kinetic energy . unlike the case of tem - eels",
    ", we do _ not _ need a several hundred kev high voltage source with the voltage stability comparable to the energy spread ( @xmath17 ) of the electron beam .",
    "third , the cooper pair box on the electron mirror must be operated in a controlled fashion and such operations must be synchronized with the pulsed electron gun .",
    "fourth , as noted earlier , the electron optical system must be sensitive enough so that a single excess cooper pair in the cooper pair box can be seen with the electron optics .",
    "fifth and finally , after interacting with the cooper pair box , the probe electron must be accelerated to several hundred kev before interacting with the biological specimen . in principle , this can be done by brute force , i.e. by electrically floating a large part of the electron microscope on either side of the accelerator acc shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent - asst - tem structure ] by several hundred kilovolts @xcite . a recent development in this connection , on the other hand , is the use of radio - frequency accelerator that has been applied to tems @xcite and it seems to have good compatibility with a pulsed electron beam .",
    "if this approach moves beyond the proof - of - principle stage , then it will be unnecessary to electrically float such a large part of the microscope as described above .",
    "structure of the proposed transmission electron microscope .",
    "electrons emitted form a pulsed electron source ( pes ) goes through a monochromator ( mc ) and are directed by an electron beam separator ( ebs ) towards a low temperature electron mirror ( em ) , on which a cooper pair box ( cpb ) is placed .",
    "all these processes happen with a very low kinetic energy of the electron .",
    "afterwards , the electron is accelerated in an accelerator ( acc ) , goes through a condenser lens ( cl ) , specimen ( sp ) , objective lens ( ol ) , projector lens system ( pls ) and finally detected by an area detector ( ad ) .",
    "the ol and pls may not be necessary in actual settings.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we describe the _ single electron process _ that lies at the heart of our method .",
    "as shown later , mutiple single electron processes ( @xmath18 of them ) will comprise a _",
    "k - electron process _ in our scheme .",
    "the single electron process involves a single imaging electron and proceeds as follows .",
    "suppose that the cpb is in a superposed charge state @xmath19 before the electron from the electron gun approaches the cpb .",
    "after the electron interacts with the cpb , it gets entangled with the cpb so that the whole quantum state of the cpb - electron system is@xmath20 where the electron states @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively denotes electron waves incident on @xmath11 and @xmath12 regions on the specimen . upon transmission through the specimen ,",
    "the electron wave in the state @xmath22 acquires a phase factor @xmath23 relative to the state @xmath21 , corresponding to the phase shift @xmath24 .",
    "hence the state becomes @xmath25 .",
    "let the electron state @xmath26 represent a diffracted wave to the @xmath27-th pixel of the area detector .",
    "we expand the electron states @xmath28 in terms of these states as@xmath29 using these , we obtain another expression of the state @xmath30 as@xmath31 upon detection of the electron at the @xmath27-th pixel of the area detector , the cpb is left in the state @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a real normalization factor .    in reality ,",
    "an electron wave is not a qubit .",
    "one way to make the above argument somewhat more precise is to expand the state @xmath22 as@xmath34@xmath35 where each state on the right hand side is spatially more localized on the specimen than the state @xmath22 is .",
    "the state becomes , after transmission through the specimen,@xmath36 in this case , the above phase shift value @xmath24 would represent something similar to , but not identical with , the average of @xmath37 .",
    "this way of representation would be more suitable when we deal with a specimen with a structure within the region of the electron beam .",
    "however , we will not pursue this representation .",
    "the point is also related to the _ similar intensity map condition _ @xcite , to which we now turn .    to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume that @xmath38 , which amounts to saying that the electron waves @xmath28 from the two small regions @xmath39 have similar intensity on the area detector .",
    "this assumption is what we call the similar intensity map condition .",
    "the assumption appears to be natural , but to what extent the similar intensity map condition is satisfied must be carefully evaluated , which will be done in sec .",
    "[ sec : coherent errors ] .",
    "once we accept @xmath38 , we may write @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents a _ known _ phase shift associated with the optical path length difference between two electron trajectories , starting respectively at the specimen regions @xmath39 and ending at the @xmath27-th pixel of the area detector . the cpb state ( [ eq : post cpb state-1 ] )",
    "may then be expressed as , up to the overall phase factor,@xmath42 since we know @xmath41 , by quantum information processing machinery developed for the cpb @xcite we may nullify it to obtain@xmath43 let us call this last step as the _ phase compensation step_. comparing equations ( [ eq : pre cpb state ] ) and ( [ eq : post cpb state-3 ] ) , we see that , assuming that the similar intensity map condition is satisfied , the net effect induced by the single electron process is multiplication of the phase factor @xmath23 to the cpb state @xmath14 relative to @xmath13 .",
    "the k - electron process in our scheme consists of , in the order of execution , the cpb initialization step , repeated single electron processes that is described above ( @xmath18 times ) , and the cpb readout step . first , the cpb is initialized to the state @xmath44 .",
    "second , the single electron process is repeated @xmath18 times , resulting in the state@xmath45 this state may be expressed as , up to the overall phase factor , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "finally , in the cpb readout step we measure the cpb state with respect to the basis @xmath49 .",
    "probabilities to find the state in these basis states are respectively@xmath50 notice , by the way , that the @xmath41 correction step between the states ( [ eq : post cpb state-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : post cpb state-3 ] ) within the k - electron process may collectively be postponed until right before the cpb readout step . in this case ,",
    "all @xmath18 phase correction values are recorded ; and their sum is used in the combined correction step .",
    "we show how the heisenberg limit can be approached .",
    "we write the electron dose for a measurement on a single spot on the specimen @xmath2 , which must be kept below a certain value in order not to damage the specimen significantly .",
    "hence we can repeat the k - electron process @xmath51 times ( that we assume to be an integer for simplicity ) . as is well known from the theory of binomial distribution",

    ", we assume that @xmath56 , although this may not necessarily be a good approximation in some of actual settings .",
    "then we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath55=n/4+o\\left(nk^{2}\\delta\\varphi^{2}\\right)\\cong n/4 $ ] . introducing another random variable @xmath58 , we have@xmath59=\\delta\\varphi,\\textrm { } var\\left[y\\right]=\\frac{4}{k^{2}n^{2}}var\\left[x\\right]=\\frac{1}{kn}.\\ ] ] hence , the expected error in determining @xmath24 with the k - electron process",
    "is @xmath60 .",
    "note that this represents the standard quantum limit when @xmath61 and the heisenberg limit when @xmath62 .",
    "we remark that , despite being sequential , our scheme may also be regarded as one using something akin to the bosonic noon state @xcite .",
    "suppose that we had an unusually long electron microscope column between the cpb - incorporated electron mirror and the specimen .",
    "then all @xmath18 electrons would be flying simultaneously in the column before any of them colliding with the specimen . from the discussions above",
    ", we see that these electrons would be in the state@xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the state in which all electrons are in the state @xmath21 , and likewise for @xmath65 .",
    "there are at least three sources of errors in the scheme reviewed in this section .",
    "first , to what extent the similar intensity map condition holds should be investigated , as remarked above . if this condition is significantly violated , then the absolute values of the coefficients @xmath66 in equation ( [ eq : pre cpb state ] ) deviate from the ideal @xmath67 , making the contrast of the final measurement weaker .",
    "second , when inelastic scattering happens , which is indeed @xmath68 times more likely to happen than the elastic counterpart in cryoelectron microscopy , we lose some coherence in the cpb state .",
    "in particular , if the inelastic event is _ localized _ , then the specimen would measure the probe electron state with respect to the localized basis states @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", the coherence would be completely lost . however , the actual situation is subtler and we will investigate how things should behave .",
    "third , we have not thoroughly analyzed the cpb - electron entangling interaction to estimate what and how much errors would be introduced when the electron bounces off the cpb in the electron mirror .",
    "we will consider the first two sources of errors in this paper , while leaving the last item for future analysis .",
    "what frequency of faulty measurement can we tolerate ? to get a rough idea , let us simplify the situation and consider a totally destructive event that projects the cpb state onto either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "suppose that such a destructive event occurs at random with the probability @xmath69 .",
    "the number of k - electron process is @xmath51 and any k - electron process fails if a destructive event occurs more than once during @xmath18 single electron processes .",
    "( for simplicity , we assume that the experimenter , being somewhat lazy , does not abort the k - electron process upon such a destructive event . )",
    "the success probability of a k - electron process is @xmath70 if @xmath69 is sufficiently small .",
    "the number of k - electron processes for the same dose @xmath2 is @xmath71 .",
    "retracing the argument in the previous subsection [ sub : a - brief - review ] , we have the expectation value @xmath72=n'p_{\\leftarrow}$ ] , variance @xmath73=n'p_{\\leftarrow}p_{\\rightarrow}$ ] , @xmath74 , and eventually@xmath75=\\delta\\theta,\\textrm { } var\\left[y'\\right]=\\frac{1}{k^{2}n'}=\\frac{1}{kne^{-kp_{d}}}.\\ ] ] we want the variance @xmath76 $ ] smaller than the variance in the conventional case @xmath77 .",
    "to find @xmath78 that minimizes the ratio @xmath76/n^{-1}$ ] , we differentiate this expression and equate the result to zero .",
    "we find @xmath79 and this result remains valid when , e. g. , we minimize the ratio of standard deviations @xmath80/n^{-1}}$ ] instead of @xmath76/n^{-1}$ ] .",
    "when errors are not totally destructive , the error will still accumulate in the random - walk - like fashion and will eventually become totally destructive . in this case , we may redefine @xmath69 accordingly ( which we do not do in this paper ) so that , on average , it takes approximately @xmath81 single electron processes for the accumulated error to be fully destructive .",
    "finally , we remark on relativistic effects .",
    "since the tem we have in our mind may well operate at voltages as high as 300 kev , there will be relativistic effects . in the rest of the paper we use the so - called relativistically corrected schrodinger equation , which is a good approximation to the dirac equation in our case @xcite .",
    "the equation _ is _ the standard time - independent schrodinger equation , but the mass @xmath82 and the energy @xmath83 are interpreted respectively as @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the electron rest mass , and @xmath89 is the relativistic electron energy including the rest energy @xmath90 .",
    "in this section , we study the extent to which the similar intensity map condition @xmath38 is satisfied , for two cases of the probe electron beam geometry .      first we study a simple case , in which the two regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are adjacent two small regions of the same size of @xmath91 .",
    "we consider a @xmath92 thick specimen .",
    "we assume that the electrons are detected on a diffraction plane .",
    "then the problem is effectively about the diffraction pattern from a small spot and the question is how smooth the intensity on the detector is . let us focus on the region @xmath11 .",
    "let the @xmath93-axis be parallel to the direction of the incident wave propagation and let the position of the specimen be at @xmath94 .",
    "atoms in the specimen are labeled by an integer @xmath95 and are respectively located at @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the scattering amplitude of the @xmath95-th atom corresponding to its elemental identity .",
    "we assume the electron waves to be monochromatic and write the wavenumber @xmath18 .",
    "we ignore multiple scatterings in the specimen .",
    "we want the incident beam to be gaussian with the waist size @xmath98 and assume that the diffraction - limited waist of the gaussian beam is on the specimen . without loss of generality ,",
    "we compute the wave amplitude at a point p in the far field on the @xmath99-plane , where @xmath100 is large and @xmath101 coordinate is given by @xmath102 . far from the specimen",
    ", the transmitted gaussian wave has the known form in the paraxial approximation ( see appendix a ) @xmath103 that can be approximated as@xmath104 consider a single elastic scattering event .",
    "the amplitude of the scattered wave at the point p is found to be ( see appendix a ) @xmath105 for simplicity , let us first consider the contributions to the wave amplitude @xmath106 only from _ uniformly _ distributed carbon atoms , which we write @xmath107 .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath97 is that of carbon @xmath108 .",
    "let the number density of carbon atoms per unit area perpendicular to the optical axis be @xmath109 .",
    "the value of @xmath107 is@xmath110 @xmath111 simple addition will extend this result to the case of multiple chemical elements . comparing with equation ( [ eq : transmitted wave far field 2 ] ) , we see that the scattered wave @xmath107 does almost nothing more than shifting the phase of the transmitted wave , especially when the angular spread of @xmath112 is larger than the gaussian incident beam spread , which is about a few mrad in the present case .",
    "it is the random , as opposed to uniform , arrangement of atoms that we need to analyze to evaluate how well the similar intensity map condition is fulfilled .",
    "note that @xmath93-coordinates @xmath113 of atoms do not appear in equation ( [ eq : scattered wave 1 ] ) because of approximations discussed in appendix a. hence , what matters is only the projected atomic distribution of the specimen to a plane perpendicular to the optical axis .",
    "henceforth we assume that such a projected atomic distribution is completely random .",
    "this assumption obviously fails if , for example , the specimen is atomically thin because interatomic distance can not be too small in real specimens , and there may well be other objections to this assumption . however , we assume that this assumption will give us a good guide especially when the specimen is sufficiently thick .",
    "computation of equation ( [ eq : scattered wave 1 ] ) beyond the average case resembles the analysis of random walk .",
    "let the specimen plane be divided into many thin concentric rings centered at the optical axis with the radius @xmath114 and small width @xmath115 .",
    "label the rings with a natural number @xmath27 in the order of increasing @xmath116 .",
    "assume that , despite the small width @xmath115 , each ring still contains many atoms .",
    "again for simplicity , we consider only carbon atoms .",
    "let the number of carbon atoms in the @xmath27-th ring be @xmath117 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : scattered wave 1 ] ) is then rewritten as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a set of integers consisting of the indices of carbon atoms that belong to the @xmath27-th ring .",
    "hence the cardinality of @xmath119 is @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath120 be large enough so that all sort of phase angles in the range @xmath121 appear in the sum @xmath122 .",
    "in other words , we consider the region outside the peak of transmitted wave in the diffraction pattern . in this case",
    ", we may regard the sum as 2-dimensional random walk on the gaussian plane and we have @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a random phase . more precisely , we accept that the angle @xmath125 behaves as a random variable with the uniform distribution because of the large @xmath120 and the supposedly random arrangement of the carbon atoms from location to location within the specimen .",
    "the phase factors @xmath126 are mutually independent random variables and @xmath107 is also a random variable in this view .",
    "clearly , the expectation value @xmath127 is zero because of the random phase , which is consistent with what equation ( [ eq : scattered wave 1c ] ) states .",
    "( note that the expectation value here is with respect to the random arrangement of atoms and has nothing to do with the randomness in quantum measurement . )",
    "however , the expectation value of the absolute square of the wavefunction is nonzero because multiplication of phase factors @xmath128 results in @xmath129 when @xmath130:@xmath131^{2}\\sum_{j}n_{j , c}e^{-\\frac{2r_{j}^{2}}{w_{0}^{2}}}=\\left[\\frac{f_{c}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{r}\\right]^{2}\\sum_{j}n_{c}e^{-\\frac{2r_{j}^{2}}{w_{0}^{2}}}2\\pi r_{j}\\delta r_{j}\\ ] ] @xmath132^{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}n_{c}e^{-\\frac{2r^{2}}{w_{0}^{2}}}2\\pi rdr=\\frac{\\pi}{2}n_{c}w_{0}^{2}\\left[\\frac{f_{c}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{r}\\right]^{2}\\ ] ] since we assume that the atomic arrangements are independent to each other among the chemical elements , the contributions from elements other than carbon can be accounted for by simple addition to the above expression .",
    "crucially , the variance of @xmath133 , that is @xmath134 , equals @xmath135 .",
    "this may be verified by noting that multiplication of four phase factors @xmath136 results in @xmath129 when either _",

    "this is a rather curious feature of quantum measurement in this particular case , but the feature may be more generic .",
    "if so , we might state that we generally do not want to know more than needed in quantum measurement .    to compute the frequency of elastic scattering",

    "we now turn to the second case , where a circular region @xmath11 surrounds a smaller circular region @xmath12 .",
    "these two regions share the central point .",
    "this configuration appeared in a simulation study previously reported @xcite . to be specific , we consider the following situation : the incident beam has a relatively large divergence angle @xmath147 ( notice that we add primes to these variables in the present diverging beam case ) , which is larger than the characteristic angle @xmath141 of the scattering amplitude functions @xmath148 . for @xmath7 electrons ,",

    "comparing with equation ( [ eq : transmitted wave far field 2 ] ) , if we take the two @xmath179 factors as close to @xmath129 , then equation ( [ eq : uniform scattered wave 4 ] ) represents a phase shift of the incident wave by an angle @xmath180 , as long as this quantity is small .",
    "this finding is consistent with the result on weak phase object described in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .    again , in order to evaluate the validity of the similar intensity map condition ,",
    "random atomic distributions must be considered instead of the uniform distribution . in this case , the scattered wave spreads with the half angle that roughly equals addition of @xmath181 and the characteristic angle of elastic scattering @xmath182 .",
    "( in the above uniform atomic distribution case , the half angle does not exceed @xmath181 because beyond this angle , scattered waves from the atoms destructively interfere . )",
    "let us consider two angular regions separately .",
    "first , if the angle @xmath120 is less than @xmath181 , the transmission wave @xmath183 is the largest component that goes into this angular region .",
    "the scattered waves from each atom , on the other hand , constructively interfere more or less , because of the small @xmath120 .",
    "the resultant @xmath184 , with @xmath185 phase shift , adds to @xmath183 . as noted above , @xmath186 is a phase - shifted ( by the angle @xmath180 ) version of the incident wave .",
    "if the atomic density @xmath109 varies due to randomness , then the phase shift also varies .",
    "however , this randomness represents exactly what we want to measure .",
    "the phase shift @xmath180 may not be small by itself , but the difference of two phase shifts @xmath24 between the regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are small .",
    "indeed , at the @xmath187 scale , @xmath24 is expected to be @xmath188 for @xmath7 electrons @xcite and what this phase difference is expected to cause on the wave amplitude should be equal to or higher than the second - order correction , which roughly is @xmath189 .",
    "( in order to exactly compute the second order correction , we must go beyond the first - order perturbation theory , which we do not do in the present work . ) hence in this region of @xmath190 , we do not expect problems regarding the similar intensity map condition .",
    "second , consider the outer region @xmath191 . here , we expect the speckle pattern and hence we assume that the scattered waves from each atom add with random phases .",
    "hence , the average intensity in this region is the sum of the intensities of each atom:@xmath192 @xmath193 @xmath194 or equivalently , @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the scattering amplitude normalized by the bohr radius @xmath197 that is provided in ref .",

    "it should be noted that the above computation is little more than order estimation because we simply asserted that @xmath202 means complete spoiling of the measurement , and have not addressed the intermediate - level damaging of the cpb state etc .",
    "however , complete characterization of such processes would demand full computer simulations and is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we begin by reviewing several known facts , many of them found in @xcite , about inelastic electron scattering , which have been established through decades of theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "inelastic scattering by definition involves excitation of electrons within the specimen , and is _ not _ characterized by energy loss _ per se_. ( in fact , the probe electrons do lose a small amount of energy upon elastic scattering , either by high - angle scattering or generation of phonons . )",
    "conversely , elastic scattering processes are simply ones that are not inelastic scattering , and is not characterized by the ability to produce interference fringes .",
    "in fact , interference has been observed in experiments on inelastic scattering .",
    "inelastic scattering processes roughly divide into excitations of outer - shell electrons and the inner - shell counterpart .",
    "although inner shell excitation processes are generally important in eels because it carries elemental information , the associated cross sections are small and these are insignificant in the present context , as will be shown later .",
    "the outer shell excitations , on the other hand , are more complex because the states of valence electrons depends on the chemical environment of the atom under study .",
    "these excitations are typically collective in nature and in many cases , including the case of insulators and polymers , these are treated as plasmons with energy loss @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "because of the dependence on chemical bonding to neighboring atoms , inelastic scattering cross sections are difficult to predict with certainty . despite such uncertainty",
    ", it is generally accepted that energy loss at around @xmath215 does represent excitation of plasmons in vitrified biological specimens , while there are other relatively minor structures with smaller @xmath83 in the energy loss spectrum , which is thought to represent localized excitons .    here",
    "are several additional facts about inelastic scattering .",
    "first , inelastic scattering experimentally has narrower scattering angle spread when compared to elastic scattering . as will be explained shortly , however , it is not easy to talk about a characteristic or average angle associated with it .",
    "second , inelastic scattering happens roughly twice as often as elastic scattering in organic materials .",
    "third , inelastic scattering comes from long - range coulombic interaction between the probe electron and a bound electron of an atom .",
    "hence inelastic scattering can happen even when the electron beam does not directly hit the atom @xcite .",
    "this is closely related to the concept of _ delocalization _ @xcite .",
    "bethe theory provides a double - differential inelastic scattering cross section with energy loss @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "it has the following dependence on the scattering angle @xmath120:@xmath216 where @xmath197 is the bohr radius , @xmath217 is the rydberg energy , @xmath88 is the electron rest mass , @xmath218 is velocity of the incident electrons , and @xmath219 is what is called the generalized oscillator strength ( gos ) .",
    "the gos is modified when a solid specimen is considered because of factors such as chemical bonding .",
    "however , what is modified is the energy dependence of the gos and the angular distribution of inelastic scattering is mostly robust @xcite .",
    "we evaluate equation ( [ eq : bethe formula ] ) at the typical plasmon energy loss @xmath220 . the angle @xmath221 is given as @xmath34 @xmath222 where @xmath82 is the relativistic electron mass . for @xmath7 electrons and @xmath220 , @xmath223 .",
    "let @xmath224 be the wavenumber of the incident electrons .",
    "it is tempting to identify @xmath225 with the delocalization length of inelastic scattering , which should give a limit of resolution when inelastically scattered electrons are used for imaging .",
    "however , the distribution @xmath226 has a long tail . consequently ,",
    "identification of @xmath227 with the delocalization length has led to some confusion in the past because the apparent experimental resolution is much better than @xmath227 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bethe formula ] ) allows us to compute the intensity pattern of inelastically scattered electrons at the diffraction plane . from this",
    ", one can infer the wavefunction @xmath228 , where @xmath116 is the distance from the atom that scatters the electron , of the inelastically scattered electron right after the scattering by assuming that @xmath228 is real .",
    "this is done by ignoring the @xmath120 dependence of the gos and fourier transform the square root of the diffraction intensity pattern to get the wavefunction back at the specimen plane .",
    "one obtains @xcite@xmath229        we first examine , at a relatively abstract level , how inelastic scattering affects entanglement - assisted electron microscopy .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sub : a - brief - review ] that the incident electron to the specimen is entangled with the cpb as equation ( [ eq : pre whole state ] ) indicates .",
    "we first simplify the situation and suppose that the electron beam excites a single atom in the specimen .",
    "in other words , we consider a localized excitation , such as excitation of an inner - shell electron .",
    "let the ground state and excited states of the atom be @xmath230 , where the subscript _a_ stands for the word atom. the initial state before interaction between the probe electron and the specimen is @xmath231 where we use the letter @xmath232 instead of @xmath233 ( see e. g. equation([eq : pre whole state ] ) ) to indicate that the atom is now included to the system under consideration .",
    "after collision between the probe electron and the specimen , probability amplitudes that correspond to the inelastic scattering develop , although these may be of relatively small amplitude .",
    "the wave function for the entire system is written as@xmath234 @xmath235 where @xmath236 represents zero - energy - loss component of the scattered electron wave and @xmath237 etc .",
    "are inelastically scattered electron waves .",
    "let these states be properly normalized , i. e. @xmath238 etc .",
    "then , for example , the coefficient @xmath239 is a probability amplitude for the probe electron going through the region @xmath11 to excite the atom to the second excited state . now , suppose that the state of the excited atom is found to be , for example , @xmath240 by a projective measurement on the atom .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where inelastic scattering actually happens .",
    "( we of course do not measure the state of the atom experimentally , but we represent the whole complex processes after the inelastic scattering that involves thermalization , decoherence etc . by a single projective measurement where",
    "the measurement outcome is hidden to the experimenter . )",
    "then the system consisting of the cpb and probe electron is left in the state @xmath241    we are in trouble here for the following reasons .",
    "the electron states @xmath237 are rather different from @xmath236 as shown in fig .",
    "if expressed as wavefunctions , for example , the state @xmath242 is a diverging gaussian beam as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : diverging - incident - beam ] . on the other hand ,",
    "recall that the inelastically scattered electron wave generates the diffraction pattern consistent with equation ( [ eq : bethe formula ] ) and corresponds to the wavefunction ( [ eq : sqrt psf ] ) , _ if _ a plane incident wave is employed . because of the linearity of quantum mechanics , the wavefunction corresponding to the state @xmath243 equals the product of the gaussian incident wavefunction and the equation ( [ eq : sqrt psf ] ) .",
    "first , such a product may be vanishing if the overlap between the gaussian envelope and the function ( [ eq : sqrt psf ] ) is small . in this case , only one term of equation ( [ eq : delocalization principle3 ] ) survives and we get amplitude imbarance , or an amplitude error .",
    "second , the phase compensation step described in sec .",
    "[ sub : a - brief - review ] may fail because the optical path length difference is no longer the difference of distances between the detection pixel and the two regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "rather , this quantity now involves the _ modified _ two regions @xmath244 because the form of @xmath245 is localized at around the scattering atom and is different from @xmath246 . since we do not know the exact position of the inelastically scattering atom",

    "hence , we have problems in terms of both the amplitude and phase .",

    "we find that the probability for a single incident electron to cause k - shell or l - shell ionization in such @xmath143-thick specimen is @xmath247 .",
    "this figure is small enough to perform entanglement assisted electron microscopy to our advantage .",
    "the most dominant outer - shell excitations are usually plasmons and here we focus on inelastic scattering by plasmons .",
    "let us first develop a simple but admittedly inaccurate model to grasp essential physics involved .",
    "the purpose of doing so is not to estimate quantities we want to know , but to make a connection between the localized case mentioned above to the case of delocalized scattering involving plasmons .",
    "we are interested in specimens consisting of biological molecules embedded in vitreous ice .",
    "clearly , it is not adequate to model such an insulating system by free electrons in a box , as done in studies of plasmons in metals . without further justifications ,",

    "( the actual specimen is more like 2-dimensional , but we can oversimplify as long as the purpose is only to grasp essential physics . )",
    "each harmonic oscillator models an atom with a single oscillating valence electron and the immobile rest .",
    "assume that all neighboring two electrons interact as if these are connected by a mechanical spring .",
    "this assumption is hard to justify , but for the sake of simplicity we proceed",
    ". then the model is similar to the 1-dimensional model for phonons .",

    "the last term in the curly bracket in equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is the only difference from the phonon model .",
    "we apply the periodic boundary condition , i.e. , @xmath255 . let the plasmon coordinate and momentum operators be@xmath256 where @xmath257 , @xmath258 .",
    "( we use notations @xmath259 that are used in other part of this paper , since there is no danger of confusion . )",

    "an excitation of a plasmon is equivalent to the superposition of excitations of each scattering atom , with an additional phase factor that corresponds to the phase of the plasmon wave _ at least in the initial stage of time evolution .",
    "although our model is crude , we will henceforth assume that the preceding statement is robust so that it may be applied to real situations with reasonable degree of validity .",
    "from experiments we know that inelastic scattering is associated with a small scattering angle that corresponds to delocalization and long wave length plasmons .",
    "thus , unlike the case of inner - shell electron excitations , when one atom is excited in an inelastic scattering process generating a plasmon , the state must be superposed with other states , in each of which another atom ,",
    "i.e. one of the surrounding atoms , is excited .    in order to see how an excitation of a plasmon affects the measurement , we consider scattering of a plane wave .",
    "this suffices because , first , we can separately consider two terms of the whole wavefunction , containing respectively the cpb state @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and later add the results .",
    "second , all possible incident electron waves , including the diverging spherical wave , can be expanded as a sum of plane waves .",
    "we now consider all atoms that contribute their valence electron to form plasmons .",
    "for definiteness , let the number of these atoms be @xmath2 .",
    "we label them with an integer @xmath272 ( changing the meaning of @xmath2 somewhat ) and , for simplicity , we consider only the ground state @xmath273 and the first excited state @xmath274 for each of them .",
    "let the position of the @xmath95-th atom be @xmath275 .",
    "let the incident plane wave be @xmath21 .",
    "since there are many quantum entities , we will generally omit the tensor product symbol @xmath276 .",
    "the state before inelastic scattering is@xmath277 we confine ourselves to the case of single plasmon generation and we neglect terms with two or more atoms excited .",
    "a few definitions follow .",
    "let @xmath278 denote the electron state after interacting with the @xmath95-th atom , without exciting the atom s electron .",
    "( one may view this state as a superposition of the transmitted wave and elastically scattered wave . )",
    "we let the state @xmath279 represent the electron state after exciting the atom . then , after inelastic scattering , the state becomes@xmath280 @xmath281 @xmath282 where @xmath283 are probability amplitudes to reach the states @xmath284 .",
    "( for simplicity we assume that @xmath283 are independent of @xmath95 .",
    "this may not be justified , but it will be found later that this will not affect our conclusion . ) for brevity , we define some of the state of the whole specimen atoms@xmath285 @xmath286 and also define an electron state @xmath287 . in terms of these ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : many atoms excited ] ) is rewritten as@xmath288 the first term corresponds to elastic scattering , with the specimen left without excitation .",
    "now , according to the argument in the last paragraph , the state of a plasmon with wave vector @xmath289 is expressed as @xmath290 although the atoms are not regularly placed , by analogy with the fourier transform we write@xmath291 hence we have @xmath292 therefore , if we observe the plasmon in the state @xmath293 ( though this observation only models the decoherence process and we do not obtain the outcome of such an observation in practice ) , the electron wave is left in the state@xmath294 this is a superposition of electron waves inelastically scattered at each atoms , with a phase factor @xmath295 depending on the position on the specimen .",
    "if there are sufficiently many atoms , more - or - less uniformly distributed , then equation ( [ eq : scattered by a plasmon ] ) describes nothing but a tilted plane wave , whose wave vector is slightly changed by emitting a plasmon .",
    "this agrees with the standard picture of momentum conservation .    at this point",
    "we make a few remarks .",
    "first , if the amplitude @xmath296 depends on @xmath95 ( for example , because @xmath296 depends on atomic number _ z _ ) , then we may divide the atoms into classes with the same @xmath296 values .",
    "as long as the number of atoms in each class is sufficiently large to retain the above fourier - transform - like property , the conclusion stands .",
    "conversely , one may simply neglect a class that comprises too few of atoms .",
    "second , one may argue that observing the plasmon with respect to the measurement basis @xmath297 is rather arbitrary and the use of other basis should be analyzed as well .",
    "however , there are no interactions between the electron and the specimen after scattering , and statistical measurement outcomes regarding the scattered electron should not depend on how the plasmon state is measured. ( of course , being entangled to each other , the measurement outcomes on the electron and the plasmon are _",
    "correlated_. ) in addition , we will find the use of the basis @xmath297 highly convenient .",
    "third , as far as there are many atoms in the regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , all these atoms contribute to the scattered wave amplitude and there will not be much variation of the wave amplitude within the respective regions .",
    "hence , unlike the case of inner - shell electron excitations , we do not expect to have much amplitude error .",
    "fourth , we may say that the effect of having plasmon scattering is equivalent to have a thin wedge prism right next to the specimen . every time inelastic scattering occurs , the rotation angle @xmath298 of the wedge prism around the optical axis is completely random .",
    "the angle between two planes of the wedge is also random but generally obeys the formula ( [ eq : bethe formula ] ) that specifies the distribution of inelastic scattering angles . when viewed in this way",
    ", it should be clear that no matter what incident beam we use , be it focused gaussian or diverging gaussian , the effect of plasmon generation is to tilt the exit wave from the specimen by an angle proportional to the size of the plasmon wave vector .",
    "the phase error due to plasmon excitations is more problematic than the amplitude error .",
    "the mechanism for the error is that the scattered electron wave is tilted by the aforementioned wedge prism and hence the phase compensation step ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : a - brief - review ] ) can not be done accurately .",
    "let us first roughly estimate the extent of such an error .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : bethe formula ] ) is in a sense misleading because the average scattering angle is much larger than the characteristic angle @xmath299 .",
    "in fact , the mean scattering angle does not even exist for the lorentzian distribution @xmath226 unless we introduce a cutoff angle @xmath205 , above which there is no scattering .",

    "@xcite , except that we now consider inelastic scattering that occurs @xmath334 of times at random .",

    "is now modified as@xmath343 where @xmath344 represents the total error accumulated in the k - electron process .",
    "it is the sum of all individual error @xmath345 occurred during the k - electron process .",

    "we evaluated measurement errors in entanglement - assisted electron microscopy , due both to elastic and inelastic scattering processes at the specimen . despite remaining subtleties such as processing of data obtained by the significantly divergent electron beam ,",
    "overall we have found no evidence that entanglement - assisted electron microscopy is not viable for some fundamental physical reasons related to electron scattering processes .",
    "there are several lessons learned along the way .",
    "first , despite the fact that lossy processes are often emphasized as the sole fundamental limit in the quantum metrology literature , elastic scattering processes present a limit just as fundamental in the present case .",
    "the reason is that the elastic scattering signal sometimes contains information that we do not need , because the information is about too high resolution features of the specimen that can not be fully obtained anyway .",
    "this leads to an error which can not be controlled nor corrected , but it has been computed to be sufficiently small .",
    "second , besides the inner - shell excitation processes associated with a sufficiently small cross sections , inelastic scattering processes involve generation of plasmons .",
    "the excitation of a plasmon results in bending of the probe electron wave , which in turn entails phase error because the phase compensation step of the entanglement - assisted electron microscopy can not be carried out precisely .",
    "we found that the magnitude of such an error is acceptable .",
    "rather remarkably , how the two probe electron states ( that are entangled to the two cpb states ) are geometrically arranged is found to be important in order to reduce this type of error .",
    "many issues are left for future investigations .",
    "for example , the most suitable energy of the primary electron beam , which presumably depends on the specimen thickness , has not been fully understood , although the present author feels that higher energy is better , unless knock - on damage comes in to play a significant role .",
    "furthermore , errors associated with the electron reflection process at the electron mirror equipped with the cpb , or errors associated with the cpb control processes , have largely been unexplored .",
