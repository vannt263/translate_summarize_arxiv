    "ultracold neutral atoms in an optical lattice with single - atom and single - site resolution constitute an ideal physical system to investigate strongly correlated quantum phases @xcite which , in turn , has interesting applications in quantum optics @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite , among others . the first approaches towards single - site addressing considered the use of lattices with relatively large site separations @xcite",
    ". however , to have access to the regime of strongly correlated systems , typical lattice spacings well below @xmath2 m are needed since the tunneling rate has to be comparable to the on site interactions . in this case , the diffraction limit imposes strong restrictions on the addressability of individual lattice sites . to overcome this",
    "limitation different techniques have been investigated .",
    "for instance , spatially dependent electric and magnetic fields have been used to induce position dependent energy shifts on the atom @xcite , allowing for site - selective addressability .",
    "alternatively , a scanning electron microscopy system to remove atoms from individual sites with a focused electron beam @xcite has been reported . however , in this case , atoms need to be reloaded into the emptied sites after each detection event . more recently ,",
    "high resolution fluorescence imaging techniques , that make use of an optical system with high numerical aperture , have been implemented to perform _ in situ _ single - atom and single - site imaging for strongly correlated systems @xcite . in this context , a single - site addressing ( ssa ) scheme based on focused laser beams inducing position - dependent energy shifts of hyperfine states has been theoretically @xcite and experimentally reported @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "an intense addressing beam is tightly focused by means of a high resolution optical system .",
    "this beam produces spatial dependent light shifts bringing the addressed atom into resonance with a chirped microwave pulse and eventually inducing a spin - flip between two different hyperfine levels of the atom .    on the other hand , during past years , several proposals based on the interaction of spatially dependent fields , _",
    "e.g. _ , standing waves , with three - level atoms in a @xmath0-type configuration have been considered , not only for single - site addressing in optical lattices but , more generally , for sub - wavelength resolution and localization @xcite . in",
    "the first approaches @xcite , a spatially modulated dark state is created by means of either electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) or coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite , which allows for a tight localization of the atomic population in one of the ground states , around the position of the nodes of the spatially dependent field .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the resolution achieved with those cpt or eit based techniques can be surpassed using stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite processes , by means of the so - called sub - wavelength localization via adiabatic passage ( slap ) technique @xcite .",
    "the slap technique relies on a position - dependent stirap of atoms between the two ground states of a three - level @xmath0 atomic system , and has additional advantages compared with cpt or eit techniques such as ( i ) robustness against parameter variations , ( ii ) coherence of the transfer process , that allows for its implementation also in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and ( iii ) the absence of photon induced recoil .    in this work",
    ", we apply the slap technique @xcite to ultracold atoms in an optical lattice , where single - site addressing ( ssa ) requires one to overcome the diffraction limit . in order to address only a single site ,",
    "we use here stokes and pump pulses with gaussian shaped spatial distributions , with the pump presenting a node centered at the lattice site that we want to address . assuming that all the atoms in the optical lattice are initially in the same internal ground state and applying the standard stirap counterintuitive temporal sequence for the light pulses",
    "@xcite , we will demonstrate that it is possible to adiabatically transfer all the atoms , except the one at the node of the pump field , to an auxiliary ground state .",
    "we will show that this process is performed with higher efficiency and yields better spatial resolution than the cpt based techniques @xcite .",
    "also , we will demonstrate that our addressing technique requires shorter times than in the adiabatic spin - flip technique discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and that larger addressing resolutions can be achieved using similar focusing of the addressing fields . moreover , our technique has the additional advantage that it can be applied between two degenerated ground - state levels .",

    "this time sequence corresponds to apply first the stokes pulse and , with a certain temporal overlap , the pump pulse .",
    "since the process involves one of the eigenstates of the system , the population transfer is robust under fluctuations of the parameter values if these are adiabatically changed and the system does not evolve near degenerate energy eigenvalues .    in the slap technique , the pump field has a spatial structure with nodes yielding state - selective localization at those positions where the adiabatic passage process does not occur , _",

    "<S> we propose a single - site addressing implementation based on the sub - wavelength localization via adiabatic passage ( slap ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a sample of ultracold neutral atoms loaded into a two - dimensional optical lattice with one atom per site . </S>",
    "<S> each atom is modeled by a three - level @xmath0 system in interaction with a pump and a stokes laser pulse . using a pump field with a node in its spatial profile , </S>",
    "<S> the atoms at all sites are transferred from one ground state of the system to the other via stimulated raman adiabatic passage , except the one at the position of the node that remains in the initial ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this technique allows for the preparation , manipulation , and detection of atoms with a spatial resolution better than the diffraction limit , which either relaxes the requirements on the optical setup used or extends the achievable spatial resolution to lattice spacings smaller than accessible to date . in comparison to techniques based on coherent population trapping </S>",
    "<S> , slap gives a higher addressing resolution and has additional advantages such as robustness against parameter variations , coherence of the transfer process , and the absence of photon induced recoil . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the advantages of our proposal with respect to adiabatic spin - flip techniques are highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> analytic expressions for the achievable addressing resolution and efficiency are derived and compared to numerical simulations for @xmath1rb atoms in state - of - the - art optical lattices . </S>"
