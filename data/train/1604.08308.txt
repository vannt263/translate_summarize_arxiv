    "the gravitational bending of light by mass led to the first experimental confirmations of the theory of general relativity . in modern astronomy and cosmology , the gravitational lensing",
    "is widely used as one of the important tools for probing extrasolar planets , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the light bending is also of theoretical importance , especially for studying a null structure of a spacetime .",
    "a rigorous form of the bending angle plays an important role in understanding properly a strong gravitational field @xcite . for example , strong gravitational lensing in a schwarzschild black hole was considered by frittelli , kling and newman @xcite , by virbhadra and ellis @xcite and more comprehensively by virbhadra @xcite ; virbhadra , narasimha and chitre @xcite studied distinctive lensing features of naked singularities .",
    "virbhadra and ellis @xcite and virbhadra and keeton @xcite later described the strong gravitational lensing by naked singularities ; deandrea and alexander @xcite discussed the lensing by naked singularities to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis ; eiroa , romero and torres @xcite treated reissner - nordstrm black hole lensing ; perlick @xcite discussed the lensing by a barriola - vilenkin monopole and also that by an ellis wormhole . kitamura , nakajima and asada proposed a lens model whose gravitational potential declines as @xmath0 @xcite in order to study the gravitational lensing by exotic matter ( or energy ) @xcite that might follow a non - standard equation of state .",

    "some recent papers give the expressions for the deflection of light for the kottler ( often called schwarzschild - de sitter ) spacetime @xcite and for the spherical , static and vacuum exact solution in weyl conformal gravity @xcite .",
    "their results are not in agreement with each other and hence they are controversial . the apparent inconsistency among the previous works might be caused , because the spacetimes are not asymptotically flat and their methods are no longer appropriate for treating such a non - asymptotically flat spacetime . in the non - asymptotically flat spacetime , we can never assume that the source of light is located at infinite distance from a gravitational lens object .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible extension of calculations of the bending angle of light in a static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime , particularly in order to find finite - distance corrections .    for this purpose",
    ", we shall examine a relation between the bending angle of light and the gauss - bonnet theorem in differential geometry . in this sense ,",
    "the present paper may discuss a possible extension of gibbons and werner ( 2008 ) @xcite .",
    "they considered two different domains : one ( say , @xmath1 ) bounded by two light rays , to exhibit the connection between topology and multiple images ; and the other ( say , @xmath2 ) bounded by one light ray and a non - geodesic circular arc , to compute the asymptotic deflection angle .",
    "they suggested that the asymptotic deflection angle of light can be written as the surface integral of the gaussian curvature over the domain @xmath3 .",
    "they did integrate only for the asymptotic case , for which they assumed the observer and source are in the asymptotically euclidean region .",
    "namely , the angles at the location of the observer and source are defined only in euclidean space @xcite .    throughout this paper , we use the unit of @xmath4 . in the following , the observer may be called the receiver in order to avoid a confusion between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by using @xmath7 .",

    "the sss spacetime can be described as @xmath8 where the origin of the spatial coordinates is chosen as the location of a lens object , @xmath9 and @xmath10 run from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . by introducing two functions as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , eq .",

    "the above definition of @xmath63 depends on the three angles .",
    "therefore , we might be dissatisfied with the definition of @xmath63 , because the comparison of the scalars at spatially distinct points such as @xmath64 and @xmath65 is quite unclear and even questionable .",

    "the sum of @xmath159 and @xmath161 and the difference between @xmath159 and @xmath161 have no invariant meaning in general .",
    "fermat s principle in a spacetime is the principle that the light path makes the arrival time stationary .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath163 along the light ray @xcite . in our case , hence , eq . ( [ gamma ] ) implies that the orbit of light is a geodesic in @xmath24 with the optical metric @xmath23 .",
    "it is likely that mathematicians prefer to define @xmath63 by eq .",
    "( [ alpha - gb2 ] ) .",
    "however , it is quite elaborate in practice to perform the areal integral of eq .",
    "( [ alpha - gb2 ] ) . in order to do it",
    ", we have to find out the integration domain first , especially the domain boundary connecting the receiver and the source .",
    "this boundary is the light ray that is unknown a priori for most cases and hence the expression of the boundary can be obtained only after the orbit equation is solved .",
    "@xmath164 in our notation .",
    "see e.g. eq . ( 16 ) in werner(2012 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath79 can diverge at @xmath165 for black hole cases .",
    "for such cases , it is likely that eq .",
    "( [ alpha - gb2 ] ) requires more mathematical treatments , because the singularity at @xmath165 is hidden by a horizon .",
    "further study along this mathematical direction is left for future work .    in discussing the effect of the cosmological constant on the bending of light , rindler and ishak",
    "have proposed a different definition of the deflection angle of light as @xmath166 , where the source ( and also the receiver ) is assumed to be at rest at the very special point that is defined as an intersection between the light ray and the @xmath167 curve .",
    "note that their calculations and results , even if they were correct , can be applied only for the particular positions of the receiver and source ( @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) and hence the applicability of their argument seems very narrow .",
    "moreover , their deflection angle ( denoted as @xmath170 ) can be written as @xmath171 in the notation of the present paper .",
    "apparently , @xmath170 agrees with eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) only for a particular case @xmath172 that is chosen by hand , such that the geometrical configuration of the lens , receiver and source can be the same as that in rindler and ishak .",
    "there is a significant difference , in spite of the apparent coincidence between the two definitions .",
    "note that they use a simple spatial metric @xmath173 to define a covariant angle @xmath174 that is different from the angle @xmath45 in the present paper .",
    "the definition of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the present paper is based on the optical metric @xmath23 that respects describing the null geodesics projected onto a spatial sector @xmath24 . practically speaking",
    ", @xmath23 is different from @xmath173 by a factor @xmath129 in a sss spacetime .",
    "see also eqs .",
    "( [ gamma-1 ] ) and ( [ gamma-2 ] ) .",
    "rindler and ishak s approach has been criticized by numerous authors ( see @xcite ) . following the pioneering work by lake @xcite , for instance , arakida and",
    "kasai claimed that , even if the cosmological constant is taken into account , the deflection angle of light can be rearranged as @xmath175 to agree with that in schwarzschild spacetime , if the impact parameter @xmath41 is replaced by a new impact parameter @xmath162 in order to absorb the influence of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "arakida and kasai continued to argue that the orbit equation in the presence of the cosmological constant becomes the same as that for the schwarzschild case , after the impact parameter is suitably shifted .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the deflection angles for both cases agreed with each other .",
    "however , this final step in their argument is misleading . the receiver and source",
    "can be located at the null infinity for the schwarzschild case . on the other hand",
    ", we can never assume @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the kottler case , because the receiver and source go across de - sitter horizon in this limit .",
    "in other words , they should have integrated the orbit equation from a finite - distance source to a finite - distance receiver .",
    "if they had done it , they might have obtained the deflection angle with certain corrections due to the finiteness of distance .",

    "it is likely that the nonvanishing contributions to @xmath63 at the linear order of @xmath176 and @xmath140 in the previous works are because they did not use the optical metric to define the angles at the receiver and the source and they employed a different definition of @xmath63 by following @xcite . in particular",
