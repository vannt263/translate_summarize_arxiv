    "the worst systematic errors in lattice simulations are due to cut - off artifacts . for fermionic systems they are typically of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lattice spacing . for a long time , the attempts to improve the lattice action such that the artifacts are dampened , yielded only a limited success .",
    "last year , p. hasenfratz and f. niedermayer proposed a new method for approximating perfect actions ( actions free of cut - off effects ) for asymptotically free theories @xcite .",
    "it might have the potential for a break - through which enables us to solve lattice qcd .",
    "first we note that the fixed point actions ( fpas ) - obtained from iterated block spin renormalization group transformations ( rgts ) on a critical surface ( see e.g. @xcite ) - are perfect actions .",
    "however , since the correlation length @xmath3 diverges there , they can not be used in simulations .",
    "kogut and wilson @xcite noticed that perfect actions exist also off the critical surface .",
    "they lie on ` renormalized trajectories ' ( rts ) in parameter space , which cross the critical surface in a fixed point .",
    "the direction of the tangent there corresponds to a relevant ( or marginal ) direction .",
    "if we move slightly away from a fixed point in a relevant direction and perform rgts , then we follow the rt .",
    "thus all points on it are related to the vicinity of the fixed point without occurrence of irrelevant terms .    for asymptotically free theories",
    ", there is only one ( weakly ) relevant ( to leading order marginal ) direction .",
    "hasenfratz and niedermayer propose to follow this direction down to a @xmath3 short enough for simulation , i.e. to approximate the rt linearly .",
    "the points on this tangent are referred to as ` perfect classical actions ' and there is hope that they still have very small cut - off artifacts .",
    "the virtue of asymptotically free theories ( in this context ) is that their fpas can be determined classically .",
    "the pilot project of hasenfratz and niedermayer dealt with the @xmath4 nonlinear @xmath5 model in @xmath6 and was a full success . even on a lattice as small as @xmath7",
    "cut - off effects were numerically not visible any more .",
    "the final goal is of course qcd .",
    "a collaboration is presently studying the pure @xmath8 gauge theory in this respect @xcite .    here",
    "we present results for the 2d gross  neveu model @xcite , which turned out to be a good testing ground for the method when applied to fermionic systems .",
    "first , one of us found a line of fpas for free wilson fermions @xcite which also applies to a number of other lattice fermions ( slac , rebbi , etc .",
    ", see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this set does not include the staggered fermions which we are going to use here .",
    "their main advantage is the remnant @xmath9 symmetry which persists at free , local fixed points @xcite .",
    "we perform rgts according to the prescription in @xcite i.e. we attach pseudo flavors to the corners of ( disjoint ) @xmath10 blocks and build block spins such that the pseudo flavors do nt mix .",
    "therefore an odd blocking factor is needed ; we chose it to be 3 .",
    "then we have intersecting @xmath11 blocks , whose centers form a lattice of spacing 3 and which are occupied by alternating pseudo flavors . every point in a block with the same pseudo flavor as the center contributes to its block spin which lives again on the block center",
    ". then we rescale coordinates and fields .",
    "we take a lattice of spacing @xmath12 . for technical reasons we initially put the fermionic pseudo flavors @xmath13 ( one  component grassmann variables ) on the centers @xmath14 of disjoint @xmath10 blocks ( spacing 1 ) .",
    "later the fermionic variables are moved to the corners ( in @xcite we proceeded differently ) . for the action after a number of rgts we make the general ansatz @xmath15 = \\sum_{x , y } \\sum_{i , j=1}^{4 } { \\overline{\\chi}}^{i}_{x } \\rho^{ij}(x - y ) \\chi^{j}_{y } \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath16 is invariant against translations by integers ( but not half integers ) along the coordinate axes .",
    "the matrix for the fermions shifted to the corners is ( in momentum space ) denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "its form is restricted by charge conjugation , @xmath18 symmetry and half integer translations .",
    "its structure , resp .",
    "the one of its inverse @xmath19 is @xmath20 starting from the standard action with @xmath21 ( in lattice notation : @xmath22 , we arrive at the fixed point given by @xmath23 here a renormalization parameter in the blocking step had to be chosen in agreement with the dimension of @xmath24 .",
    "the case @xmath25 corresponds to a @xmath26function blocking rgt , but we may add a ` smearing term ' suppressed by @xmath27 , which does not break any symmetry and which helps to optimize the locality , see @xcite .",
    "our main interest was to gain experience with interacting fermionic models , the simplest asymptotically free one being the gross ",
    "neveu model in two dimensions ( gn ) .",
