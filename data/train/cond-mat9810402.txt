    "the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) is always present in addition to the short - range exchange interaction . although its energy is lower than the exchange energy it plays an important role in low - dimensional systems due to its anisotropic and long - range character .",

    "the mn compounds are of particular interest .",

    "in this section we calculate the classical ground states of the system as a function of the ratio of the dipolar energy to the interchain exchange interaction @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the volume of the primitive cell . due to the quasi - one - dimensionality of the systems ( the ratio @xmath14 is @xmath15 ) we consider only antiferromagnetic spin configurations along the chain axis , i.e. , we restrict @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",

    "collinear phase : @xmath29 + spins within basal planes are oriented ferromagnetically in chains , that are aligned antiferromagnetically to one another ( see fig .
