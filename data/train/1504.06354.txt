    "planetary systems seem to be composed of one or more stars , orbited by about a dozen planets and many minor bodies @xcite .",
    "the latter can be roughly divided into hundreds of moons and dwarf planets , and many millions of planetesimals .",
    "the objects closer to the star seem to be organized in a disk - like structure in which also the planets reside , and which flares to become spherical at larger distance from the stellar host .",
    "this view of planetary systems is heavily based on the solar system , but so far its generality can not be excluded , because each of the several thousands planetary systems known today @xcite seem to comply to this characteristic .",
    "this view is also supported by our limited understanding of the formation of planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the orbits of planets and minor bodies within a few stellar radii are affected by tidal evolution .",
    "once the star leaves the main - sequence , copious mass loss starts to affect the entire planetary system @xcite .",
    "we refrain from discussing these complexities here , but concentrate on the dynamically affected regime : sufficiently far away and sufficiently early in its evolution to remain unaffected by the stellar host .",
    "the effect of perturbations on the solar system either from the local planets , external perturbations from the birth cluster or even from the galaxy have been studied quite extensively ( for a few recent studies see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we start with a discussion on the solar system in  [ sect : ss ] and generalize in  [ sect : general ] .",
    "apart from mass loss and tidal evolution the inner regions of the solar system are most strongly affected by dynamical interactions with the giant planets .",
    "we can calculate the range of dynamical reorganization caused by the widest massive planet in a planetary system by adopting its apocenter distance . for the solar system ,",
    "this range is currently determined by the planet neptune , which affects the orbits of minor bodies to a distance @xmath0au . within this distance",
    "the planets in the solar system have caused major changes in the orbital distributions of the minor bodies @xcite .",
    "we could argue that within a distance of @xmath1 the minor bodies in the solar system quickly lose memory of the mechanism that brought them in these orbits . here",
    "@xmath2 is the eccentricity of the planetesimal .    , for the number of encounters that perturb the solar system at a given semi - major axis @xmath3 and eccentricity @xmath2 . for the birth cluster we adopted the mass of @xmath4 and virial radius of 2pc to remain constant over a time scale of 200myr .",
    "the solid black curve gives the semi - major axis up to which neptune can perturb orbits .",
    "the blue dashed curve gives the distance to which star q @xcite , that passed the sun with an impact parameter of 320au , has perturbed the solar system . according to the color scaling along the right edge of the figure ,",
    "such a close encounter could have occurred roughly once while the solar system was a member of the star cluster .",
    "the two bullet points give the orbital parameters of sedna @xcite and 2012vp@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]      we adopt the view that all stars are born in a clustered environment .",
    "the densities of these environments vary enormously from @xmath6star / pc@xmath7 to more than @xmath8 stars / pc@xmath7 .",
    "the time that the solar system with minor bodies remains in the environment determines the degree by which it is dynamically affected by stellar encounters ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "those encounters play a major role in the evolution of these environments .",
    "the degree by which the planetary system is affected by such encounters depends on the duration and the intensity of the exposure .",
    "further internal reorganization of the perturbed planetary system enables the external perturbations to propagate , generally on a much longer time scale , to the inner parts of the planetary system .",
    "the way in which a planetary system is affected by dynamical encounters depends on the mass of the encountering star , its impact parameter with respect to the host star , the velocity @xmath9 and the direction with respect of the planetesimal disk .",
    "this complicated combination of parameters and their mutual relations in terms of the degree of perturbations for the planetary system can be summarized in a cross section @xmath10 .",
    "most important for preserving the integrity of the planetary system is its eccentricity .",
    "here we adopt a lower limit to the perturbation of the eccentricity of @xmath11 to be fatal for the particular planetesimal .",
    "the cross section of eccentricity perturbation of a planetary system around a star with mass @xmath12 , through an encounter with another star of mass @xmath13 has been estimated by means of integrating small - n systems and averaging over the various encounter angles @xcite : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the cross section for encountering a single star and @xmath16 is for binaries .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is the binary fraction , which is between 0 and 1 .",
    "we adopt @xmath18 . in the adiabatic regime where the encounter velocity is comparable to the orbital velocity and which is suitable for encounter in star clusters , both cross sections have a similar form @xcite ( with subscript x = single or x = binary depending on the configuration of the encountering object ) : @xmath19 }              \\left ( m \\over [ { \\mbox{${\\rm m}_\\odot$ } } ] \\right)^{-1/3 }             \\left ( v \\over [ { \\rm km / s } ] \\right)^{-\\gamma }             \\exp \\left ( b ( 1-e_{\\rm f } ) \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : crosssection}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is the relative velocity for which we adopted the velocity dispersion in the cluster and @xmath3 is the orbital semi - major axis of the planetary system before the encounter .",
    "the post encounter eccentricity , @xmath20 .",
    "eq.[eq : crosssection ] was calibrated for initially circular orbits , but we apply them here also for eccentric orbits . according to @xcite the cross sections do not depend much on the pre - encounter eccentricity ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend on the binarity of the encountering object . for a single star @xmath24au@xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , whereas for a binary @xmath28au@xmath25 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this cross section the local stellar density @xmath31 and the velocity dispersion",
    "@xmath32 we can calculate the encounter rate : @xmath33    in figure[fig : cluster ] we present the expected value for the number of encounters in the sun s parental star cluster .",
    "here we adopted the cluster parameters derived by @xcite : a total mass of about @xmath34 , and a virial radius of 2pc , which result in a stellar density of about 100stars / pc@xmath7 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath35km / s .",
    "the lifetime of a star cluster in the galactic disc can be estimated from : @xmath36 } \\right)^{0.60}.\\ ] ] for the star cluster in which the sun was born this results in a lifetime of about 200myr .",
    "our adopted cluster lifetime and the assumption of a constant density within this period are very approximate .",
    "however , our intention is to estimate the relative importance of experiencing an encounter in the parental star cluster or in the milky way galaxy , for which this approach suffices . in order to estimate the importance of these assumptions we integrated the cluster mass and radius evolution from the simulations by @xcite .",
    "they aimed their simulations at mimicking pleiades , praesepe and hyades , which have comparable initial conditions as the solar birth cluster . according to these simulations , clusters with such parameters",
    "survive for as long as a gyr during which the cluster mass drops linearly with time . in this period",
    "the cluster expands by about a factor of 3 , roughly proportional to the square root of time . with this slightly more elaborate estimate",
    "we argue that we overestimate the exposure of encounters in the star cluster by about a factor of two .",
    "this would be consistent with adopting 100myr for the cluster exposure calculation in figure[fig : cluster ] , rather than 200myr .",
    "the distance to which these perturbations induced by close encounters penetrate into the solar system , depends on the distance of closest approach @xmath37 , and the eccentricity of the encounter @xmath38 , and can be expressed in @xcite : @xmath39    recently @xcite argue that the planetesimals sedna @xcite and 2012vp@xmath5 @xcite were captured by a close encounter from a @xmath40 star that passed the solar system with a closest approach of @xmath41au and relative velocity @xmath42km / s ( which corresponds to an eccentricity @xmath43 ) . according to eq.[eq : penetration ] , such an encounter would have perturbed the solar system to a distance of about 36au . in figure[fig : cluster ] we present the distance to which such and encountering star perturbs the planetesimal around the sun . for completeness",
    "we include the two objects sedna and 2012vp@xmath5 to indicate how dramatically the encounter with star q perturbed the solar system .",
    "once the parental star cluster dissolves , the planetary system can only be perturbed by internal reorganization , and by the galaxy .",
    "this latter can be subdivided in a global perturbation from the slowly varying galactic tidal field , but the occasional close encounters with field stars are more important ( see however * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the probability of an encounter with a galactic field star is much smaller than of a close encounter in a star cluster , but the lower encounter rate is compensated in part by the longer time spent in the relatively low - density environment of the galaxy compared to the time spent in the star cluster .    for estimating the effect of an encounter with a field star we can not simply adopt eq[eq : crosssection ] because these are tuned for low - velocity ( and low eccentricity ) encounters , whereas galactic encounters tend to occur with a much higher velocities .",
    "we therefore adopt the classic gravitatioal focussed cross section @xcite @xmath44 for calculating the encounter rate between the solar system ( @xmath45 ) and another galactic star of mass @xmath13 to a closest approach distance @xmath3 .    to provide an upper limit to the effect an encounter has on the orbital parameters of the planets or planetesimals we assume that the perturbed object and the closest approach are aligned .",
    "the heliocentric impulse gained by the object at distance @xmath46 from the sun is then given by @xcite : @xmath47 here we assumed that the relative velocity , @xmath48km / s , remains constant during the encounter and the mass of an encountering star @xmath49 .",
    "the perturbation is effective at apohelion ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) and we estimate the distance to which the perturbation penetrates the solar system at the point where the impulse gained by the object is comparable to its velocity at apohelion .",
    "this is a rather arbitrary choice , but suffices to indicate to which distance a passing field star may have affected planetesimals in the solar system .    in fig.[fig : galaxy ] we present the number of encounters that perturbed the solar system by a passing galactic disk star , after the parental star cluster has been dissolved .",
    "the probability distribution is calculated using eq.[eq : gamma ] and adopting @xmath51stars / pc@xmath52 and a velocity dispersion in the local standard of rest of @xmath53km / s , and the time the solar system spent in the galaxy , @xmath54gyr . for comparison with fig.[fig : cluster ] , we include the curve for planetary perturbations ( solid black curve ) and the two objects sedna and 2012vp@xmath5 .",
    ": the probability density distribution for the number of encounters that affect the orbits in the solar system to a given semi - major axis @xmath3 and eccentricity @xmath2 . here",
    "we adopted a stellar density of @xmath55stars / pc@xmath7 , a velocity dispersion of @xmath56km / s and the typical mass of an encountering star of @xmath49 .",
    "the solid black curve and the two bullet points give the neptune s perturbing distance , and the orbital parameters for sedna and 2012vp@xmath5 , see also fig.[fig : cluster ] .",
    "the yellow curve gives the distance to which the solar system was perturbed ( by 1% of its velocity at apohelion ) due to the recent encounter with the 0.15 binary star wise  j072003.20 - 084651.2 , which grazed the solar system , but clearly did not come in close enough to perturb the inner oort cloud .",
    "[ fig : galaxy ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    recently the solar system had a close encounter with the @xmath57 binary star wise j072003.20 - 084651.2 at a distance of @xmath58pc @xcite .",
    "we estimate the perturbation by this encounter using the impulse approximation @xcite , in which the duration of the encounter is assumed to be much shorter that the period of the perturbed orbit ( opposite to the adiabatic regime in which eq .",
    "[ eq : penetration ] is valid ) .",
    "the impulsive approximation is fulfilled for the encounter with scholz s star , which had a relative velocity of @xmath59km / s @xcite .",
    "we indicate this distance by the yellow curve in fig.[fig : galaxy ] .    according to our analysis such an encounter ( at @xmath60au ) should occur @xmath61 times during the @xmath62gyr sojourn of the solar system through the galactic disk .",
    "such encounter is therefore quite a likely event , which occurs roughly once every million years .",
    "the close approach of scholz s star occurred only 70,000 years ago @xcite , which seems amazingly recent .",
    "if we naively divide the two time scales , such an encounter should already have happened @xmath63 times .",
    "the effect of this particular encounter has hardly perturbed the @xcite cloud down to a distance of @xmath64au from the sun .",
    "but an encounter with an equally low - mass star three orders of magnitude closer in would have affected the outer most planets . with the derived probability distribution eq.[eq : gamma ] using eq.[eq : gravfocuscrosssection ] for the cross section and eq.[eq : impulse ] to estimate the distance to which such an encounter affects the solar system .",
    "such an encounter would be very unlikely to happen over the lifetime of the solar system .    considering the analysis of @xcite the encounter that introduced the sednitos ( a family of planetesimals with orbits similar to the 2003vb@xmath65 sedna ) into the solar system occurred in the parental cluster , and since then no other stellar encounter has perturbed edgewordt - kuiper @xcite belt .",
    "this picture is consistent with the presence of a _ parking zone _ ( see  [ sect : zones ] ) in the solar system between about 100au and 1000au ; encounters that affect the solar system to a distance within 1000au are extremely rare .",
    "the parking zone in the solar system is populated by the sednitos @xcite ; planetesimals that share a common argument of pericenter , inclination and perihelion distance .",
    "we argue that the parking zone in the solar system extends from about 100au to the about @xmath66au , near the outer boundary of the inner oort cloud .",
    "the distribution of orbital parameters of planetesimals discovered in this regime bear the information of the last strong encounter the sun experienced from the time when it was part of its parental cluster .",
    "in fig.[fig : fragility ] we present a generalized view of the fragility of planetary systems .",
    "the solid black curve gives the range to which possible massive planets perturb the inner parts of the planetary system .",
    "violent planet scattering can cause massive planets to migrate further outwards , where they can perturb the local planetesimals @xcite . in that case , the solid curve will shift to the right .",
    "the parental star cluster perturbs its planetary systems , but the further evolution of the planetary system determines to what range such a perturbation is preserved over time . for a globular cluster",
    "the stellar density is generally higher than for an open cluster , and the probability of spending a prolonged period in a globular cluster is also larger . as a result",
    "the range to which the planetary system is perturbed when born in a globular cluster is much closer to the star than for an open cluster .",
    "in fact , from the schematic picture ( fig.[fig : fragility ] ) the influence of random encounters while the member of a globular clusters penetrates all the way to the inner planets . as a consequence ,",
    "planetary systems in globular clusters , or other massive dense star clusters , are likely to be perturbed by internal as well as external effects .",
    "this may explain , in part , the lack of observed planets in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "if born in a low density cluster with a relatively short lifetime , the range to which random encounters penetrate into the planetary system hardly reaches the influence range of the giant planets .",
    "once the planetary system escapes the star cluster , the perturbations from the galaxy start to affect the orbits of the objects .",
    "this influence prolongs for the remainder of the main - sequence lifetime of the parent star , after which stellar evolution starts to play a major role in the redistribution of the orbits .      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   _ we define the parking zone as a range in semi - major axis and eccentricity in which the orbits of objects have only been affected by encounters in the parental star cluster , and not by the local planets or by the galaxy .",

    "the parking zone is likely to shrink with time , and young stars tend to have a more extended parking zone than older stars , due to the less prolonged exposure to galactic encounters .    objects with orbital parameters in the parking zone preserve information about the last event that affected their orbits in the planetary system . once in the parking zone ,",
