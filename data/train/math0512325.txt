    "consider a four - color urn model in which the replacement matrix is actually a stochastic matrix @xmath0 as in ref .",
    "@xcite . that is , we start with one ball of any color , which is the trial .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the column vector of the number of balls of the four colors up to the @xmath2-th trial , where the components of @xmath1 are nonnegative real numbers .",
    "then a color is observed by random sampling from a multinomial distribution with probabilities @xmath3 .",
    "depending on the color that is observed , the corresponding row of @xmath0 is added to @xmath4 and this gives @xmath5 .",
    "a special case of the main theorem of gouet @xcite is that if the stochastic matrix @xmath0 is irreducible , then @xmath6 converges almost surely ( a.s . ) to the stationary distribution @xmath7 of the irreducible stochastic matrix @xmath0 ( it should be carefully noted that the multicolor urn model is vastly different from the markov chain evolving according to the transition matrix equal to the stochastic matrix @xmath0 , also notice that @xmath8 is a row vector ) .",
    "suppose the nonprincipal eigenvalues of @xmath0 satisfy @xmath9 respectively , which are assumed to be real ( and hence lie in @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 be the corresponding eigenvectors . using @xmath12 it is seen that @xmath13 .",
    "central and functional central limit theorems for @xmath14 have been the subject of several papers in the literature @xcite especially for two - color models and also some multicolor models .",
    "the norming in the central limit theorems in the two color urn models depends on the nonprincipal eigenvalue as follows : for @xmath15 the rate is @xmath16 , for @xmath17 the rate is @xmath18 and the limits are normal in these two cases .",
    "however for @xmath19 the rate is @xmath20 and in this case the limit exists almostsurely .",
    "functional central limit theorems ( fclt ) for a class of two - color urn models have been considered by gouet @xcite .",
    "these fclt s of gouet @xcite use the same norming , as stated in the previous paragraph , under which central limit theorems have been proved in @xcite and @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite contains a survey of the literature on such fclt s . in this article",
    "we prove a different fclt that uses random variables with the norming @xmath20 irrespective of whether @xmath21 is less than 1/2 , equal to 1/2 or greater than 1/2 .",
    "this is the main result of the paper . for the sake of convenience",
    "we restrict ourselves to real eigenvalues only .",
    "we state the result for the above four - color model but it can be seen from the proof that it can be extended to urn models with any number ofcolors .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we develop the notation , state the main result and give its proof .",
    "some of the calculations have been done separately in3 .",
    "we write @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath24 . from the description of the urn model we have @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the column vector consisting of the indicator functions of balls of the four colors respectively .",
    "we also have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-field of observations up to the @xmath2-th trial . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath30 is a martingale . from ",
    "3 , it follows that @xmath31 is @xmath32-bounded so that it converges almost surely .",
    "however in the two color case , for @xmath33 and for @xmath34 converge to normal distributions and the fclt s proved in @xcite use such normalizations .",
    "thus the question of using the same norming @xmath35 , to get an fclt irrespective of @xmath36 or @xmath37 , is of interest .",
    "our main result , proposition  2.1 , is a step in this direction using the tails of the sequence @xmath38 whereas the fclt s in the literature are based on partial sums starting from thebeginning .",
    "@xmath39    the sequence of processes @xmath40 where @xmath41 } m^{\\lambda_i - 1/2 } ( z_{i , m+1 } - z_{i , m}),\\quad i = 1 , 2 , 3 , \\",

    "note that the process @xmath47 can be viewed as a multidimensional wiener process with covariance function @xmath48 .    from eq .",
    "( [ fera ] ) we have the following expansion : @xmath49 & \\sim - \\frac{\\lambda_i}{m } z_{i , m } +   \\lambda_i \\frac{\\chi_{m+1}^\\prime \\xi_i}{m^{\\lambda_i}}.\\label{hi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the components of @xmath50 are martingales , an independent increments gaussian process as a limiting process is expected . in particular",
    "we follow theorem  1.4 , p.  339 of @xcite , by which it is enough to show that the joint characteristics of the martingales converge to a joint covariance function .",

    "also notice that this part of the argument does not depend on whether @xmath62 or @xmath63 are less than or equal to 1/2 .    to see why the contribution to the cross quadratic variation from the first terms of ( [ fi ] ) goes to @xmath64 , by cauchy ",

    "now consider as to what will happen if we were computing say @xmath74 .",
    "for @xmath75 , the expansion ( [ fi ] ) is similar , and in the cross quadratic variation the contribution of the second term from the right - hand side of @xmath76 is similar to what we had before . for @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath77 is a martingale and from appendix  3.3 , @xmath78 so @xmath79 converges almost surely .",
