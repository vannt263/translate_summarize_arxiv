    "one of the most fundamental and intriguing problems in plasmonics is the electromagnetic interaction of two metallic nanostructures , i.e. , the dimer structure .",
    "the gap - dependent electric - field enhancement and bonding plasmon resonance energies have been utilized in e.g. surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy  @xcite and the plasmon ruler effect  @xcite .",
    "the dimer has been studied with a variety of theoretical and experimental techniques .",
    "the simplest theoretical approach is based on the classical local - response approximation ( lra ) , which in the extreme case of a nanometre - sized dimer gap gives rise to unphysical results , such as diverging field enhancements in the gap of the dimer  @xcite .",
    "a complete breakdown of the lra is seen in the touching configuration , where the number of hybridized bonding plasmon modes increases without bound to form a continuum of modes  @xcite .",
    "advanced descriptions based on density - functional theory ( dft ) regularize the unphysical consequences of the lra  @xcite , where the physical mechanism for the regularization is attributed to quantum tunnelling , i.e. , the charge transfer that may occur before reaching the touching configuration due to the spill - out of electrons . numerical dft calculations of optically excited dimers show a limit on the hybridization of bonding plasmon modes , yet no general relation for this limit has been extracted .",
    "results based on the hydrodynamic model , where only nonlocal response ( and not electron spill - out ) is taken into account , also display regularizations of the lra  @xcite , albeit with field enhancements in the dimer gap that are still larger than shown by dft simulations  @xcite .",
    "measurements on dimers with vanishing gaps using both optical techniques  @xcite and electron energy - loss spectroscopy  @xcite are not in agreement with the lra , and , in the touching case , also display limits on the resonance energies of the bonding plasmon modes .",

    "the three cases of separated dimer ( @xmath1 ) , touching dimer ( @xmath2 ) and overlapping dimer ( @xmath3 ) are shown . ]    in this paper , we revisit the problem of a plasmonic dimer , which consists of two identical cylinders excited by a plane wave ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , within the framework of our recently proposed gnor model in which nonlocal response is caused both by convection and diffusion  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dft , the physically more transparent gnor model allows for analytical results .",
    "we study the evolution of both the extinction cross section and the electric - field enhancement in the dimer gap as the gap size varies from separated to overlapping dimers .",
    "in particular , we focus on the touching dimer and derive , using the formalism of transformation optics ( to ) , a simple analytical relation for the resonance energies of the bonding plasmon modes .",

    "although the mathematical formalism of the gnor model is similar to the hydrodynamic model , with the simple substitution @xmath17 , the physical consequences are pronounced .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] . for the smallest dimer radii ( @xmath41  nm ) ,",
    "the resonance positions of the bqp mode are not clearly distinguishable from the extinction spectra due to the weaker hybridization in smaller dimers . as the dimer radius increases the resonance energies of both the bdp and bqp modes decrease .",
