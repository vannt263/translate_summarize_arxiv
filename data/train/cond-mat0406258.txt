    "recently many theoretical and experimental studies have focused on quantum dots , in which electrons are confined to a mesoscopically small region .",
    "these structures are of interest both for studying fundamental physics and for potential nanotechnology applications . with advances in materials",
    "science , semiconductor quantum dots have become particularly popular .",
    "most semiconductor dots consist of layers of semiconductor with the electrons confined by the band structure to a layer interface , forming a quasi-2d electron gas .",
    "the electrons are further confined in the plane to form the dot , usually by charged gates .",
    "quantum dots containing many electrons are often referred to as `` large dots '' , and those with few ( often @xmath3 ) as `` small dots '' .",
    "a large dot has a relatively dense electron spectrum and therefore poorly controlled external parameters like the shape of gates , impurities , etc .",
    "bring an intrinsic external random component into any description of the dot . for a small dot",
    "the uncertainty in the parameters is negligible .",
    "the external confining potential can be approximated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the effective mass of the electron in the semiconductor , and for circular dots @xmath6 .",
    "such small dots are in essence artificial atoms .",
    "however , they have the advantage of allowing direct measurement of transport properties , and experimental control over basic parameters such as the size and strength of the confining potential and the number of electrons in the dot",
    ". they can also be driven by external magnetic fields that would be inaccessible in atomic physics with realistic magnetic fields .",
    "small circular quantum dots have been investigated experimentally by tarucha _",
    "_ @xcite and by kouwenhoven _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "these studies have clearly demonstrated the shell structure of the energy spectrum , the effect which one would expect from analogy with atoms or nuclei . where there is a shell structure we might also expect hund s rule to be obeyed for the total spin of the dot .",
    "quantum dots have attracted the attention of numerous theoretical studies , for reviews see refs .",
    "the electronic structure of 2d small quantum dots has been studied using spin density functional theory @xcite as well as by restricted and unrestricted hartree - fock methods @xcite .",
    "these studies have also clearly demonstrated the shell structure of circular dots and they have confirmed the validity of hund s rule for such dots . as expected , elliptical deformation destroys both the shell structure and hund s rule .",
    "the spin - density - functional calculations also lead to spin - density wave states .",
    "however , as has been pointed out by hirose and wingreen @xcite such states are artifacts of broken spin symmetry in density - functional theory .",
    "this is quite similar to what has been known to occur in unrestricted hartree - fock since the work of overhauser @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , there are similarities between small quantum dots and atoms .",
    "therefore theoretical methods used in atomic physics could be efficient in studies of quantum dots .",
    "it is known that for few ( 2 - 4 ) electron atoms the best available method is the pair equation method .",
    "the configuration - interaction method also works well in this case .",
    "however for multi - electron atoms the best available method is hartree - fock with further account taken of correlations using many - body perturbation theory . this method is used nowadays in practically all precise calculations for multi - electron atoms , see e.g. refs @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge it has never been used before for quantum dots . in the present work we perform such calculations .",
    "our results for total energies and shell structure are rather similar to already known ones .",
    "however the results concerning the spin structure are different .",
    "we never observe a spin density wave in a state with total spin zero .",
    "the wave can appear at the hartree - fock level , but taking correlations into account restores the rotational symmetry .",
    "so , on this we agree with works @xcite and disagree with @xcite .",
    "studies have also been done in which the rotational symmetry has been explicitly restored after unrestricted hartree - fock via projection techniques.@xcite    in the circular dot we have found that the total spin sometimes varies from that predicted by hund s rule . for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , we found that the ground states have minimal spin as opposed to the previous result of maximal spin within the confines of hund s rule .",
    "we have also studied elliptically deformed small dots , paying special attention to the case @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known from nuclear physics @xcite that the shell structure is restored when the ratio of frequencies is a rational number .",
    "this is certainly true for a parabolic potential . for a quantum dot",
    "the total self - consistent potential is not parabolic ( even if the external potential is parabolic ) , but nevertheless we show that there are some peculiarities in the spectrum of the dot at @xmath11 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "estimates ] we present simple semiclassical estimates which allow us to relate the number of electrons , the strength of the confining potential , and the relative strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "section [ sec : method ] is devoted to an overview of the computational method .",
    "section [ sec : twobody ] concerns the two- and six - electron problems in the external parabolic potential .",
    "the two - electron problem can easily be solved exactly , while for the six - electron problem we compare to the configuration - interaction study of reimann _ _ et al.__@xcite . comparing these accurate energies with our restricted and unrestricted hartree - fock results",
    "we demonstrate how unrestricted hartree - fock generates the spin density waves and how correlations restore the rotational symmetry .",
    "based on the results of this section it appears that the method gives reliable results to at least @xmath12 , although there appears to be some n - dependence in the accuracy .",
    "finally , section [ sec : round ] presents our results for circular parabolic dots , and section [ sec : elliptical ] presents results for elliptical dots .",
    "in this section we use atomic units for energy and length @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the elementary charge , @xmath5 is the electron effective mass , and @xmath15 is the dielectric constant of the material .",
    "numerical values are presented for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which correspond to the gaas commonly used in quantum dots .",
    "the confining external potential is of the form @xmath18 assuming that the number of electrons in the dot is large , @xmath19 , we can use the standard semiclassical expression for number density in a 2d circular dot of radius @xmath20 @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the electrostatic potential energy at the origin and at the edge of the dot is @xmath23 in the thomas - fermi approximation the number density at @xmath24 is related to the fermi momentum at this point @xmath25 and the self - consistency equation reads @xmath26 at @xmath19 the fermi energy is small ( @xmath27 ) compared to the self - consistent potential .",
    "so eq . ( [ tf2 ] ) implies that @xmath28 .",
    "this gives the standard semiclassical relation between the size of the dot and the number of electrons ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath29 the number density of electrons varies from point to point",
    ". therefore the interaction is less important at the centre and more important towards the edge of the dot . to characterize the interaction",
    "we define an average @xmath1 according to the equation @xmath30 then , using ( [ rel1 ] ) one finds @xmath31 note that this definition of @xmath1 differs from that accepted in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "this difference is due to the semiclassical estimate we use for the dot density in eq .",
    "( [ dens ] ) , as opposed to the assumption@xcite that the density is roughly flat .    the total energy of the dot scales as @xmath33 we will use eqs . ( [ rel1 ] ) , ( [ rs ] ) , ( [ r1 ] ) , and ( [ eto ] ) not only for circular dots , but for elliptic dots as well . in this case",
    "we will take @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we stress once more that eqs .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) , ( [ rs ] ) , ( [ r1 ] ) , and ( [ eto ] ) are written in dimensionless atomic units .",
    "( [ units ] ) one can easily convert them to other units .",
    "for example a gaas quantum dot with @xmath36 and containing about 20 electrons should have a radius of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "the confining potential @xmath38 must be on the order of 8 mev once any screening effects from the surrounding layers are considered .",
    "the electron wavefunctions are modeled on a square lattice .",
    "essentially we consider an anderson model with hamiltonian    @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the creation operator of an electron with spin projection @xmath41 ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) at site @xmath44 of the two - dimensional square lattice with lattice spacing equal to one .",
    "@xmath45 represents a sum over nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the single particle dispersion corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is @xmath46 at larger momenta the dispersion deviates from quadratic dispersion , so to simulate the real quadratic dispersion we need to have many lattice points within one period of the electron wave function , which is on the order of one atomic unit .",
    "for this reason , the units of length used in the anderson hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) are not atomic units .",
    "the hamiltonian is written in units in which the lattice spacing is one , where the lattice spacing needs to be significantly smaller than one atomic unit .",
    "the coulomb interaction @xmath47 is singular at @xmath48 .",
    "this is an unphysical singularity as , firstly , if the integral were performed in continuous instead of discrete 2d space there would be no divergence , and secondly as in a real dot there is transverse ( orthogonal to the plane ) confinement with some finite effective length , typically on the order of @xmath49 .    here ,",
    "we avoid adding a finite width to our model in order to be able to compare our results to exact and configuration - interaction 2d calculations .",
    "instead we consider that when @xmath50 , the effective distance between electrons should not be taken to be zero , but some finite value characteristic of the size of the lattice cell .",
    "we obtain an approximate value for the integral at @xmath51 by treating the wavefunctions as constant over the unit cell and taking the integral of @xmath47 over the cell . that is , when @xmath50 , we take    @xmath52    where the `` inverse characteristic distance '' of @xmath53 is in units determined by the lattice spacing .",
    "the hartree - fock results are slightly sensitive to the value given here . however ,",
    "when correlations are taken into account the results are not sensitive to this value .    as a first approximation for the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) we use the unrestricted and restricted hartree - fock ( hf ) methods , modified according to the optimal damping algorithm of cances and le bris@xcite .",
    "recall that the hf equations are of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a single electron orbital which has energy @xmath56 , and spin projection on the z - axis @xmath57 .",
    "the hf hamiltonian matrix is of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 are direct and exchange interactions .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian has only diagonal and nearest neighbour nonzero matrix elements , @xmath60 hear @xmath61 is the usual kronecker delta . @xmath62 if @xmath63 and @xmath64 are nearest neighbours and @xmath65 otherwise .",
    "the total energy of the system is    @xmath66    in the unrestricted hf ( uhf ) method the single particle orbitals with spin up are completely independent of those with spin down .",
    "therefore , generally uhf spontaneously violates the rotational invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the total spin @xmath67 does not commute with the uhf hamiltonian and hence only the z - projection of the total spin , @xmath68 , is conserved . to characterise this effect",
    "we introduce the parameter `` spin separation '' @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the total density of electrons with spin up and @xmath71 is the total density of electrons with spin down .",
    "the spin separation measures the spatial separation of up and down electrons .",
    "it can be nonzero even for a state with @xmath72 . strictly speaking",
    "the spontaneous violation of rotational symmetry and hence nonzero value of @xmath73 for a state with @xmath72 is not a physical effect , but a byproduct of the method .",
    "nevertheless , a calculation of @xmath73 can shed light on the physics of the system .",
    "for example , zero @xmath73 indicates that there is no spontaneous symmetry violation . if @xmath74 in the sector with @xmath72 there are two possibilities : either the total spin is @xmath75 and we effectively see the state @xmath76 , or the state is @xmath77 . by performing the uhf calculation in the sector with @xmath78 one can try to distinguish between these possibilities .    in the restricted hf ( rhf ) method the hf equations are exactly the same , but in addition we impose the constraint that electron orbitals with spin up and spin down are identical .",
    "hence rhf automatically respects the spin rotational invariance and describes the state with @xmath79 .",
    "the rhf total energy is always higher than the uhf total energy .",
    "the leading correlation correction to the total energy is given by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ corr1 ] .",
    "the corresponding formula reads    @xmath80    where the coulomb matrix element is defined as    @xmath81    it is well known that in a 3d uniform electron gas the direct diagram in fig .",
    "[ corr1 ] is logarithmically divergent due to the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction .",
    "hence it requires consideration of screening effects ( higher orders of perturbation theory ) even at very small @xmath1.@xcite fortunately for the 2d case the diagram is convergent .",
    "moreover we consider a relatively small dot and in this case the second order correlation diagram is convergent even in the 3d case .",
    "there is no difference between an even and an odd number of electrons when performing uhf calculations .",
    "however , a restricted hartree - fock calculation with an odd number of electrons is not straightforward as the spin - up and spin - down electrons must feel a different exchange potential , breaking the symmetry required by rhf .",
    "the slater determinant of the problem consists of @xmath82 doubly occupied orbitals which represent a core with total spin zero , and also one upper orbital which contains only one electron . to preserve the rotational invariance of the core we use the same method used in atomic physics ; we average over polarizations of the unpaired electron .",
    "this means that we introduce occupation numbers @xmath83 where @xmath84 for any core orbital , @xmath85 where @xmath14 is the external orbital , and @xmath86 otherwise .",
    "the hartree - fock equations ( [ hfe])-([eqn : hfen ] ) are modified appropriately .",
    "for example instead of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hfen ] ) , the total energy reads @xmath87 this procedure defines our first approximation and it corresponds to the many - body state with total spin @xmath88 .    the next step is to take into account the fact that the real state contains one @xmath89 electron and no @xmath90 electron .",
    "we use perturbation theory , which automatically guarantees that the total spin remains @xmath88 .",
    "the transition from two external `` half - electrons '' to one `` whole '' external electron results in a perturbation acting on the external electron @xmath91 , and perturbations acting on the core electrons @xmath92 and @xmath93 . here",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 represent direct and exchange interaction with the `` external '' orbital @xmath96 . applying these perturbations",
    "one finds the following first- and second - order corrections to total energy ( [ ehf1/2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath97 we use the notation defined in eq .",
    "( [ matrixel ] ) .",

    "in ( [ 1/2 ] ) we go to second order in order to retain formal accuracy comparable to the correlation terms ( [ c1 ] ) .",

    "however , at larger @xmath1 the ground state uhf energy is lower than that obtained in the restricted hartree - fock method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twoelec]a ) . the uhf energy for the ground state approaches the energy of the first excitation with @xmath75 at larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "this illustrates that the uhf method spontaneously violates the spin and rotational symmetry of the problem and mixes the true ground state , which has @xmath79 , with the state @xmath112 . at @xmath113",
    "the @xmath75 component dominates .",
    "this leads to early `` wigner crystallization '' which is a byproduct of the uhf method .",
    "this is confirmed by the pictures of electron density at @xmath114 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare2 ] .",
    "there are two separate peaks in the uhf electron density ; one corresponds to the electron with spin up and another to the electron with spin down .",
    "the uhf spin separation parameter ( [ ssep ] ) is @xmath115 . at the same time",
    "neither the exact solution nor the rhf solution indicate any spin separation .    taking correlations into account",
    "drastically changes the situation . the total rhf+correlation energy shown by the dotted line fig .",
    "[ fig : twoelec]b is close to the exact energy up to very high @xmath1 for the two - electron problem and is below the corresponding energy obtained with the uhf+correlations method .",
    "thus the inclusion of correlations leads to the choice of the rhf solution as the ground state , hence restoring the rotational invariance at @xmath79 . certainly at very large @xmath1 , all hartree - fock methods fail .",
