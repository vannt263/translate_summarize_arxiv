    "landscapes built of a large number of different fluxes give rise to a vast discretuum of vacua , and so will naturally contain ones that , like our own , have a tiny cosmological constant @xcite . in this paper , we show that transitions between these vacua typically occur by giant leaps , discharging many fluxes in unison ; such transitions dramatically alter the cosmological constant .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we found effects that enhance giant leaps , which relate to the presence of a radion . in this paper",
    ", we find a different set of enhancements , which exist even when the radion is fixed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : multiflux ] , we study landscapes built of many genuinely different fluxes , and in sec .  [",
    "sec : monkey ] we study the more sophisticated case where these different fluxes arise from a single higher - dimensional flux wrapping many different cycles of the internal manifold .",
    "our paradigmatic example is the bousso - polchinski ( bp ) landscape @xcite .",
    "following bp , we treat the radion as fixed , and work in the thin probe - brane approximation .",
    "transitions in this landscape have received much attention @xcite , but this paper is the first to identify the dominant decay : giant leaps .",
    "we show that the branes that discharge different fluxes attract , so that decay proceeds by whole stacks of branes at once , rather than a single brane as was previously assumed .",
    "though still generically exponentially suppressed , giant leaps are the fastest decay . in @xcite , we show that giant leaps persist away from these approximations by studying decays in an explicit radion stabilization , 6d einstein - maxwell theory with many distinct fluxes .",
    "a collection of @xmath2 different fluxes , whose legs all point down the extra dimensions , makes a contribution to the cosmological constant , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 @xmath5 is the charge of the @xmath6th magnetic quantum , and @xmath7 is the number of units of the @xmath6th magnetic flux .",
    "these fluxes may be discharged by nucleating a brane that forms a bubble in the extended directions . if the brane carries @xmath8 units of charge , then inside the bubble @xmath9 so that the energy density inside is reduced by @xmath10 the surface tension of the bubble is set by the brane tension ; for the black branes , m - branes and d - branes we are interested in , that tension is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 4d planck mass .",
    "the rate to nucleate such a bubble is @xmath13 , where in the thin - wall , probe - brane , semiclassical , no-4d - gravity approximation @xcite @xmath14    what is the fastest decay ?",
    "it depends on the @xmath5s and the @xmath15s . for definiteness and simplicity we will focus throughout this paper on the case of identical fluxes @xmath16 .",
    "we will also focus on a special class of states , the ` diagonal ' states that have @xmath17 . these states are privileged because states off the diagonal , with unequal @xmath18 , decay towards them ; the largest @xmath15 discharge first , as these decays most rapidly reduce @xmath19 . for diagonal states , one decay direction ,",
    "` monoflux decays ' , is to drop @xmath20 units from a single flux , while leaving the other fluxes untouched . a second decay direction , `",
    "multiflux decays ' , is to drop just a single unit each from @xmath20 different fluxes .",
    "these definitions coincide for @xmath21 , which has tension @xmath22 and rate exponent @xmath23 . but as @xmath20 increases , there are two effects that make monoflux decays slower than multiflux decays .    * @xmath24-effect * : for monoflux decays , @xmath25 . this is linear because these extremal branes do not interact  their magnetic repulsion exactly cancels their gravitational attraction .",
    "for multiflux decays , @xmath26 . this is slower than linear because the branes bind together since they are charged under different fluxes , there is now no magnetic repulsion to cancel their gravitational attraction .",
    "smaller @xmath24 means faster decay .    * @xmath27-effect * : for monoflux decays , @xmath28 . this is slower than linear because the flux lines repel . for multiflux decays , @xmath29",
    "this is linear because the flux lines are different and do nt interact .",
    "larger @xmath27 means faster decay .",
    "the rate exponent @xmath30 can be evaluated for both decay directions .",
    "monoflux decays get slower with increasing @xmath20 , @xmath31 > b_1 $ ] .",
    "but multiflux decays get faster @xmath32 = \\frac{b_1}{n}. \\label{eq : multirate}\\ ] ] indeed the fastest possible decay of a diagonal state is @xmath33 , discharging one unit of each flux in unison and moving one step down the diagonal .",
    "( that moving many steps down the diagonal is slower follows from the monoflux result , with @xmath34 . )    if the @xmath5 vary , then the analog of the diagonal states are those with @xmath35s as equal as possible consistent with quantization .",
    "decaying down the diagonal now may mean discharging more than a single unit of the fluxes with small @xmath5 .",
    "gravitational corrections are easy to add ; the form of the corrections was calculated by coleman and de luccia @xcite . while @xmath23 receives large gravitational corrections , eq .",
    "[ eq : multirate ] is exact for decays from minkowski . for decays from low and intermediate de sitter ,",
    "it receives only small modifications , so that our parent vacuum is likely a giant leap away . from high de sitter states , however , gravitational modifications are significant and small steps are the fastest decay .",
    "to confirm giant leaps away from the thin - wall , probe - brane approximation requires choosing an explicit flux compactification , as we have done in @xcite .",
    "in the last section we saw that , in landscapes built of many genuinely different fluxes , the most likely decay is a giant leap . in this section",
    "we will investigate whether the same holds true when the ` different ' fluxes are really , from the higher - dimensional viewpoint , the _ same _ flux , just wrapped around different compact cycles .    following bp @xcite ,",
    "let s compactify on a flat @xmath36-torus . to preserve macroscopic lorentz symmetry , a @xmath37-form @xmath38 that lives in this ( 3",
    "+ 1+@xmath36)-dimensional spacetime must point legs in _ no _ macroscopic direction ( and so @xmath39 must point legs in _ every _ macroscopic direction ) ; after integrating out the extra dimensions , @xmath38 becomes a scalar ( and @xmath39 a four - form ) .",
    "let s consider an @xmath40 that wraps a single basis @xmath37-cycle    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to see why the dual cycle is appropriate , consider integrating the magnetic source equation @xmath41 in a gaussian pillbox across the brane . restricting to the extra dimensions , if this flat brane is spanned by one forms @xmath42 , then @xmath43 and indeed this works for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , etc .",
    "the effective tension of this brane is proportional to the fundamental tension times its volume in the extra dimensions , @xmath46 where @xmath47 ; again this is consistent with @xmath48 .",
    "a general @xmath40 will have components along many of the @xmath49 basis @xmath37-cycles of the @xmath36-torus @xmath50 the cross - terms in @xmath19 all vanish so we recover eq .",
    "[ fsquared ] , and with it the @xmath27-effect .",
    "what of eq .",
    "[ tension ] and the @xmath24-effect ?    to discharge many fluxes at once , the brane must wrap many basis co - cycles  the appropriate configuration will be the one that does this with minimum possible area , and so minimum possible effective tension . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we study this constrained optimization problem ; we start with a few simple examples and build up to the general case . for now , we set @xmath51 and the sides of the torus to 1 .    for a @xmath52 * -form * on an @xmath53 * -torus * , @xmath54 . to discharge a flux wound round the @xmath55-direction ( @xmath56 )",
    "requires a brane wound round the @xmath57-direction ( @xmath58 ) , and vice versa . to discharge both at once , @xmath59 ,",
    "one possibility is to use two different branes , wrapping the @xmath57- and @xmath55-directions respectively , for a total tension of @xmath60 .",
    "but you can do better .",
    "the brane can instead stretch across the diagonal ( @xmath61 ) , so that it still wraps the same cycle but has lower area , for a tension of @xmath62 :     [ fig:5d1each ]    this diagonal brane is the shortest brane that achieves this transition ( it s the minimum area element of its homology class , the ` minimal brane ' ) , and the @xmath24-effect is retained .",
    "analogous configurations can be found for any combination of fluxes dropped . to discharge @xmath63 , the minimal brane",
    "is stretched in the normal direction to the flux dropped , @xmath64 , and has length @xmath65 .",
    "for example ,     [ fig:5dmultieach ]    is the minimal brane with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , shown both in the covering space and projected onto the unit cell . in this case , eq .",
    "[ tension ] just amounts to pythagoras theorem .    for a @xmath52 * -form * on an @xmath68 * -torus * , @xmath69 .",
    "discharging @xmath56 takes a two - brane stretched along the @xmath57-@xmath70 cycle , and so on . as before , discharging @xmath71 does nt take two branes and total tension 2 , but only a single flat brane with @xmath72 and total tension @xmath62 :     [ fig:6dneighbours ]    indeed , for any @xmath73 there is a minimal brane with tension @xmath74 ; the normal to the brane points in the direction of the dropped flux . for example",
    ",     [ fig:6ddouble ]    is the minimal brane that drops @xmath75 .",
    "up to now it has all been straightforward ",
    "we could unwrap any set of fluxes in any combination with a single flat brane , and the story has been the same as it was for the genuinely different fluxes of sec .  2 . in higher dimensions , however , this is no longer true .",
    "a @xmath76 * -form * on an @xmath77 * -torus * , which has @xmath78 , has all the complexities of the general case , and we will use it to exemplify them .",
    "the source of these complexities is that you can not always discharge a given flux with a single flat brane .",
    "for example , to discharge @xmath79 takes two branes , one that spans the @xmath70-@xmath80 plane and another that spans the @xmath55-@xmath57 plane .",
    "there is no better way : these two branes only intersect at a point and can not reduce their area by coalescing .",
    "the problem is that this @xmath81 can not be written in the form @xmath82 .",
    "if it could , then by eq .",
    "[ decomposable ] , these @xmath83s span a single flat brane that would discharge this @xmath84 ; the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ decomposable ] is the volume form of the brane , so its effective tension would be given by eq .",
    "[ tension ] and we would recover the full @xmath24-effect .",
    "the property that @xmath84 is writeable in this form is known as decomposability , and a two - form is decomposable if and only if it has just a single pair of nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "[ one - forms and @xmath85-forms are always decomposable , which is why this behavior first appears at @xmath86 . ]",
    "a direct consequence is that the different effective 4d fluxes are not now interchangeable . in sec .  2 , when any two fluxes discharged together , the brane had tension @xmath87 . here",
    ", it depends _ which _ two fluxes .",
    "neighboring fluxes can be discharged together with tension @xmath87 [ e.g.  @xmath88 is decomposable ] whereas the two fluxes of eq .",
    "[ uhoh ] require tension 2 .",
    "the rotational symmetry of the landscape is broken  switching a pair of occupation numbers , @xmath89 , can change the decay rate .    bizarrer still , the reflection symmetry is broken too  switching the sign of one occupation number , @xmath90 ( and so @xmath91 ) , can also change the decay rate . for instance , @xmath92 is decomposable and discharges fast , whereas the same combination with the sign of the @xmath93 term flipped is not decomposable and discharges slowly .",
    "these complexities mean that finding the fastest decay is a more intricate problem than it was for the many genuinely different fluxes of sec .  2 .",
    "let s start , as before , by considering decay from a diagonal state with all the occupation numbers equal @xmath94 ( and continue using @xmath86 , @xmath95 as our prototype ) .",
    "the fastest decay need no longer be to discharge one unit of every type of flux .",
    "such a @xmath84 is not decomposable , so the tension must be larger than @xmath96 , and some of the @xmath24-effect is lost . but some of the @xmath24-effect is preserved : we can certainly do better than 6 separate branes by clustering neighbors and allowing them to coalesce . but",
    "even this is not the ideal configuration ",
    "these diagonal branes still intersect along a line and want to pull tight .",
    "the resulting optimal configuration can not be flat , since @xmath84 is not decomposable ; indeed the minimal brane is generally curved @xcite .    because of this impediment , decays that would have been subdominant in sec .",
    "2 can now be fastest , so that diagonal states need not decay to diagonal states .",
    "for example , it may be best to discharge fewer than @xmath2 fluxes just so that the minimal brane can be flat and the full @xmath24-effect retained .",
    "if the signs are right , five fluxes may be discharged in unison , @xmath97 , by a single flat brane . on the other hand",
    ", it may be best to discharge _ more _ flux .",
    "one unit each of five fluxes and two units of the sixth can be discharged in unison , @xmath98 , by a single flat brane .",
    "this can be the fastest decay , so that the leaps can be even gianter than in sec .",
    "[ sec : multiflux ] .    for higher dimensional tori",
    ", the story follows analogously .",
    "[ one case of special interest is the bp case , of m - theory on a flat @xmath99-torus with a @xmath100-form flux , so @xmath101 .",
    "there , a flat brane can discharge a single unit each of at most 21 of the 35 fluxes , @xmath102 . ] as before , states that are off the diagonal will decay towards it , and if the @xmath5 vary , the fastest decays will stick to the approximate diagonal .",
    "the innovation of the bousso - polchinski model @xcite is to introduce many different kinds of flux , giving a huge discretuum of vacua including many in the habitable zone .",
    "we have shown that , precisely because of the many fluxes , decay proceeds by giant leaps .",
    "giant leaps are mediated by minimal branes which , already for tori , exhibit exotic behavior not visible in the effective theory .",
    "we expect more general manifolds to have yet richer decay phenomenology , with consequences for the stability of stringy de sitter , probabilities in the landscape @xcite , and the cosmological constant @xcite .",
