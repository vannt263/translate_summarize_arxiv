    "the feynman parton distribution functions describe the internal structure of hadrons in terms of the momentum distributions of partons in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "these distributions depend only on the longitudinal momentum fractions of the target hadrons carried by the partons",
    ". the measurements of high energy hadronic processes depending on the feynman parton distributions have been made possible by proving the associated factorization theorem , which guarantees that the parton distributions studied in different processes are universal  @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "hadronic physicists become more interested in semi - inclusive high energy processes , where one can study the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons inside hadrons .",
    "the additional transverse momentum dependence helps to picture the parton distribution in a three - dimension fashion and builds the hadron tomograph through the partonic structure  @xcite .",
    "a number of novel hadronic physics phenomena are also strongly associated with the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions , such as the single transverse spin asymmetries  brohwasch02,col02,beljiyua02,boer:2003 cm and small-@xmath0 saturations phenomena  . in the last few years , great progress has been made in understanding the fundamental questions associated with these transverse momentum dependent parton distributions , such as the gauge invariance and the qcd factorization  col02,beljiyua02,jimayu04,colmet04 .",
    "in particular , the non - universality of these distribution functions due to the final / initial state interaction effects has attracted intensive investigations .",
    "it has been found that the difference between final state interaction in deep inelastic scattering and the initial state interaction in drell - yan lepton pair production in @xmath3 collisions leads to an opposite sign for the single spin asymmetries in these two processes  .",
    "more complicated relation was further found for the single spin asymmetry in dijet - correlation in @xmath3 collisions as compared to those in dis and drell - yan processes  .",
    "this eventually leads to a conclusion that a standard transverse momentum dependent factorization breaks down for this process  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the universality discussions of the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions to the small-@xmath0 domain , where the @xmath4-dependent distributions have been a common practice to describe the relevant physics phenomena  @xcite .",
    "we expect the non - universality for these objects as well .",
    "however , because of different approximation has been made in the small-@xmath0 region , the general arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite on the non - universality may not apply . as far as we know",
    ", there has been no discussion on this issue in the literature .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study this in detail .",
    "we will carry out an explicit calculation in a model where both small-@xmath0 and low transverse momentum approximation are valid .",
    "furthermore , we will resum the initial / final state interactions to all orders in perturbation to study the associated universality property .",
    "in particular , we investigate the universality of the small-@xmath0 transverse momentum dependent parton distributions probed in hadronic dijet - correlation in nucleon - nucleus collisions , as compared to that in the deep elastic lepton - nucleus ( nucleon ) scattering .",
    "there have been experimental results on di - hadron correlation in @xmath2 collisions at rhic reported by the star collaboration , and interesting phenomena were found  @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical interpretation is not yet clear at this moment  . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , two partons from the nucleon projectile and nucleus target collide with each other , and produce two jets in the final state , @xmath5 where the transverse momenta of these two jets are similar in size but opposite to each other in direction . in ideal case",
    ", these two jets are produced back - to - back .",
    "however , the gluon radiation and intrinsic transverse momenta of the initial partons induce the imbalance between them .",
    "we are particularly interested in the kinematic region that the imbalance @xmath6 is much smaller than the transverse momentum of the individual jet , namely , latexmath:[$|\\vec{q}_\\perp|\\ll",
    "|\\vec{p}_{1\\perp}|\\sim    momentum can have significant effects . since there are two incoming partons , both intrinsic transverse momenta can affect the imbalance between the two jets . for large nucleus and small-@xmath0 , the dominant contribution should come from the intrinsic transverse momentum of the parton from the nucleus , for which we labeled as @xmath8 in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on this contributions .",
    "of course , we emphasize that both contributions shall be taken into account to describe the dijet - correlation in @xmath1 scattering .     from nucleus",
    "dominates the imbalance between the two jets ; ( b ) illustration of initial / final state interactions which may affect the transverse momentum dependent quark distribution from the nucleus in this process ; ( c ) as a comparison , only the final state interaction effect is present in the deep inelastic lepton - nucleus ( nucleon ) scattering.,width=453 ]    to understand the universality property of the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution , we study the multi - gluon exchange between the hard scattering part with the nucleus target  .",
    "we illustrate the generic diagrams of these interactions in fig .",
    "1(b ) , for the particular partonic channel @xmath9 .",
    "all other channels shall follow accordingly .",
    "since the incoming and outgoing partons are all colored objects , there exist initial state interaction with the initial parton from the nucleon projectile , and final state interactions with the outgoing two partons . for comparison , we also plot in fig .",
    "1(c ) the similar diagram for the deep inelastic lepton scattering on a nucleus target , where there is only final state interaction on the struck quark . clearly",
    ", if the initial / final state interactions affect the transverse momentum dependence , we will conclude that they are not universal between these processes .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our discussions will not affect the universality for the transverse momentum integrated parton distributions .",
    "in particular , for the inclusive observables the initial / final state interaction effects can be summarized into one gauge link associated with the integrated parton distributions , which are universal among different processes  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we construct a model to investigate the universality property for the small-@xmath0 parton distributions , where all gauge boson exchange contributions can be summed up together , including all initial and final state interactions . in sec .",
    "iii , we summarize our results , and discuss the phenomenological implications , in particular , on the theoretical interpretation of the di - hadron correlation in @xmath2 collisions at rhic recently observed by the star collaboration .",
    "we take the partonic channel @xmath10 as an example to show the initial / final state interaction effects and calculate the quark distribution in dijet correlation @xmath11 , and compare with that in the deep inelastic scattering process . at small-@xmath0 ,",
    "quark distribution is dominated by gluon splitting , and can be calculated from the relevant feynman diagrams  . for the purpose of our calculation , we employ an abelian model of refs .  .",
    "it is a scalar qed model with abelian massive gluons with a mass @xmath12 .",
    "we construct the model in such a way that the large nucleus is represented by a heavy scalar target with mass @xmath13 .",
    "the scalar quarks are generated by the abelian gluon splitting which is the dominant contribution at small-@xmath0 .",
    "the associated quark distribution in deep inelastic scattering process in this model has been calculated in  .    since we are interested in studying the final state interaction effects on the parton distribution of the nucleus , for convenience , we choose the projectile as a single scalar quark with charge @xmath14 , which differs from the charge of the scalar quark from the target nucleus @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the abelian gluon attaches to the target nucleus with an effective coupling @xmath16 .",
    "all the partons in this calculation is set to be scalars with a mass @xmath17 .",
    "the coupling @xmath14 being different from @xmath15 is to show the dependence of the parton distribution on the initial / final state interactions associated with the incoming parton . if the dependence on @xmath14 remains for the nucleus parton distributions , they are not universal  .",

    "the final result does not depend on the gauge choice .",
    "we organize the calculations in terms of orders of the coupling @xmath16 . at each order",
    ", a gluon attaches the scalar quarks in partonic scattering part from the nucleus target  . as shown in fig .",

    "we emphasize that the final result is frame - independent .",
    "we calculate the scattering amplitude in the infinite momentum frame of the nucleus , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "one can also perform the calculations in the target rest frame and take the limit of @xmath24 , which will lead to the same result  @xcite . the small-@xmath0 approximation ( @xmath25 )",
    "will be taken throughout the following calculations .",
    "we will only keep the leading contributions in this limit . in additional",
    ", we also follow the low transverse momentum approximation in terms of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) by applying the power counting method  @xcite .",
    "an important simplification is the eikonal approximation , which replaces the gluon attachment to the initial and final state partons with the eikonal propagator and vertex . after taking the leading order contributions",
    ", we find that the @xmath28 dependence of these diagrams can be cast into an effective quark distribution  @xcite , which takes the following form , @xmath29with @xmath30 . here",
    "the hard partonic part depending on hard momentum scale @xmath31 has been separated from the above quark distribution in the differential cross section  @xcite .",
    "this separation is only possible at the leading power contribution of @xmath32 . the contributions from fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) and fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "( d ) simply cancels .",
    "that means at the leading order in the coupling constant , the dependence on @xmath37 drops out , which however will change at higher orders .    at the next - to - leading order , there are 20 graphs in total in covariant gauge .",
    "we plot one of these graphs as an example in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) ( a ) , and additional diagrams can be obtained by attaching the gluons to all incoming and outgoing scalar quarks .",

    "clearly , this result shows the dependence on @xmath43 . in order to check this residue dependence in the amplitude squared for the quark distribution in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we need to carry out the calculation of the amplitude up to order @xmath44 .        at the @xmath45 order , there are 120 diagrams in total with three soft gluon - exchange ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ) , including all possible permutation of the attachments of these three gluons on the target nucleus . summing up all these graphs",
    ", we obtain the three gluon exchange amplitude , @xmath46d[2]d[3]\\left\\ { g_{1}^{3}\\left [ \\frac{1}{d_{2}}-\\frac{1}{d_{1}}+\\frac{3}{% d_{13}}-\\frac{3}{d_{21}}\\right ] \\right .",

    "again , we see the dependence on @xmath37 coupling in the second and third terms",
    ". an important cross check of these results is that if we set @xmath47 , effectively there is no charge flow in the final state , and the quark distribution is identical to that in the drell - yan process in the same model . applying @xmath47 , we can easily see that indeed eqs .",
    "( 4,5 ) reproduce those calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with",

    "if we drop all @xmath14 terms in these results , we obtain the quark distribution in deep inelastic scattering process in the same model  @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that the transverse momentum dependent quark distribution @xmath49 is not universal .",
    "this non - universality is better illustrated when we sum up all order multi - gluon exchange contributions .",

    "however , because the transverse momentum @xmath28 is conjugate to the coordinate variable difference @xmath56-@xmath57 , this phase will lead to a non - universality contribution to the quark distribution as defined in eq .",

    "this transverse momentum dependent quark distribution is clearly different from that calculated in deep inelastic scattering in the same model  . in other words ,",
    "this distribution is not universal .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the @xmath37 dependence disappears after the integration over the transverse momentum .",
    "this is consistent with the universality for the integrated parton distributions  .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated the non - universality for the small-@xmath0 parton distributions in dijet correlation , by performing an explicit scalar calculation of the initial / final state interaction effects , and comparing to those in deep inelastic scattering on the nucleus target . after summing up to all orders ,",
    "we find that the net effects are summarized into a phase which leads to a non - vanishing contribution to the quark distribution and breaks the universality .",
    "it has been argued that the light - cone gauge may simplify the factorization property for the hard scattering processes .",
    "for example , if we choose the advanced boundary condition for the gauge potential in light - cone gauge , the wave function of hadrons contain the final state interaction effects  .",
    "however , as we showed in the above calculations , this does not help to resolve the @xmath37-dependence in the quark distribution in the dijet correlation in hadronic process due to the presence of both initial and final state interactions .",
    "in other words , the quark distribution of the nucleus in this process has to contain the interaction with the incoming ( outgoing ) quark with charge @xmath37 , which can not be solely included into the wave function of the nucleus target .",
    "the non - universality effect found in this paper is different from the factorization breaking effect discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the breaking effect decreases as the heavy quark mass ( equivalent to our jet transverse momentum @xmath60 ) increases . in this paper",
    ", we are discussing the non - universality effects which is in the leading power , and does not vanish with large transverse momentum of the jet .",
    "our results indicate that there might be no universality for the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions at small-@xmath0 .",
    "this may impose a challenge to explain the dijet - correlation data in @xmath2 collisions at rhic with the saturation phenomena observed in dis experiments at small-@xmath0 .",
    "the non - universality , on the other hand , provides an opportunity to study the qcd dynamics associated with the final / initial state interaction effects .",
    "these effects should be taken into account to understand the experimental data .",
    "we plan to address this issue in a saturation model   in a future publication , together with detailed derivation of this paper .",
