    "when these structures became continuously smaller , it was realized that vibrational ( or phononic ) degrees of freedom play an important role in this nonequilibrium transport problem @xcite .",
    "the ultimate limit of nanoelectronics is found in molecular electronic devices @xcite , where the building blocks consist of single molecules . due to their small size and mass ,",
    "molecules often show strong correlations between their electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it is thus of great interest to understand electron transport through a nanostructure that exhibits electronic - vibrational coupling , such as a single molecule coupled to a left and a right electrode @xcite .",

    "panel c ) shows a process , where in two sequential tunneling processes an electron - hole pair is created in the left lead upon absorption of vibrational energy from the molecular bridge . such energy - exchange processes with the leads",
    "play an important role in molecular junctions .",
    "this can be illustrated by considering a junction , where the temperature in the leads , @xmath0 , represents the largest energy scale . in this limit",
    "the population of the molecular energy levels is determined by the thermal distribution that also determines the population of the levels in the leads .",
    "the corresponding average vibrational excitation of the molecular bridge thus increases indefinitely as @xmath1 .",
    "that way , the high - temperature limit exhibits a vibrational instability in a trivial sense .",
    "similarly , the static limit @xcite , where the frequency of the vibrational modes represent the smallest energy scale , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , results in an infinite vibrational excitation , since energy - exchange processes transfer the thermal excitation of the leads to the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular bridge .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this article , we focus on the limit of a large bias voltage , @xmath4 , as well as a weak electronic - vibrational coupling , @xmath5 , and analyze the vibrational instabilities inherent to these limits .",

    "this allows a description of all resonant transport processes , but misses higher - order processes such as the broadening of levels due to the coupling between the molecule and the leads or equivalently co - tunneling processes @xcite .",
    "such processes can , in principle , be described by approaches that take into account higher - order effects , including advanced master equation approaches @xcite , scattering theory approaches @xcite , nonequilibrium green s function methods @xcite , or numerically exact methodologies @xcite . however , since we are primarily interested in the limits of resonant electron transport through single - molecule junctions , higher - order processes play no role for our considerations .",

    "in this section , we use the methodology outlined in sec .",
    "[ theory ] to investigate various limits of resonant electron transport through single molecules .",

    "furthermore , we use the wide - band approximation and assume the bias voltage @xmath56 to drop symmetrically at the contacts .      in the resonant transport regime ,",
    "the average vibrational excitation of a single - molecule junction typically increases very rapidly with increasing bias voltage @xcite .",

    "hence , for finite electronic - vibrational coupling @xmath75 , vibrational excitation must diverge as @xmath4 .    fig .",
    "[ highbias ] shows numerical results that illustrate this analytic finding . for these calculations ,",
    "we have employed a model for a molecular junction that consists of a single electronic state at @xmath76ev and a single vibrational mode with frequency @xmath77ev .",
    "the corresponding electronic - vibrational coupling strength is @xmath78ev .",
    "these parameters represent typical values for molecular junctions similar to those that have been employed in first - principles models @xcite .",
    "the level - width functions , @xmath79@xmath80ev , are chosen to be much smaller than the thermal broadening @xmath81mev @xcite .",

    "[ highbias]b represent the corresponding vibrational distribution function for bias voltages @xmath82v , @xmath83v and @xmath84v , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the vibrational distribution function becomes broader with increasing bias voltage and exhibits equal population of the lower vibrational states for large bias voltages .",
    "this leads to a continuous increase in vibrational excitation with increasing bias voltage , which does not saturate .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the lack of electron - hole pair creation processes ( cf .",
    "[ simpleemissionandabsorption]c ) , which for @xmath85 can only deexcite the vibrational mode @xcite , and which are completely blocked in the high bias limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of excitation and deexcitation processes upon electron transport through the molecule is equal .",
    "the respective stationary state is given by a vibrational distribution function , where all vibrational levels are equally populated ( cf .",
    "[ highbias]b ) .",
    "this can be rationalized considering the population of the @xmath45th vibrational level @xmath86 after any transport process in this limit .",

    "@xcite found for a junction in the high - bias limit without electronic - vibrational coupling .      for a finite bias voltage that fulfills @xmath92 , the vibrational excitation may also diverge in the limit of vanishing vibronic coupling @xmath5 .",
    "this counter - intuitive phenomenon was reported before @xcite . in subsection",
    "[ vibrinstab ] , we give a short overview of the phenomenon , and reinterpret the phenomenon in terms of electron - hole pair creation processes .",
    "this way , we establish the relation between the limit of a weak vibronic coupling and the high - bias limit discussed in the previous section . in the two subsequent sections ,",
    "we investigate the limit @xmath5 for lower bias voltages ( sec .",
    "[ nonanalytic ] ) , where the leading - order electron - hole pair creation processes are not blocked , and in the presence of a second higher - lying electronic state that is vibrationally coupled ( sec .",
    "[ higherstate ] ) .      the solid black line in fig .",
    "[ cureofvibrinst ] illustrates the phenomenon of vibrational instability in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "it represents the vibrational excitation , resulting from vibrationally coupled transport through a single electronic state , as a function of the electronic - vibrational coupling strength @xmath75 at a fixed bias voltage @xmath93ev @xmath94 .",
    "the model parameters are the same as those described in sec .",
    "[ highbiassec ] . upon reducing @xmath75 , the level of vibrational excitation monotonously increases @xcite , where the slope of this increase gets larger for smaller values of @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the vibrational distribution function ( data not shown ) becomes broader and shows an increasing number of vibrational levels , starting from the ground - state , that are equally populated .",
    "interestingly , this phenomenon occurs only if the associated bias voltage @xmath95 exceeds @xmath96 . for such bias voltages electron - hole pair creation processes ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ simpleemissionandabsorption]c ) are suppressed to lowest order in @xmath75 . in this sense , the limit @xmath5 is equivalent to the high - bias limit , where also all relevant electron - hole pair creation processes become blocked and the level of vibrational excitation diverges for @xmath4 .",
    "these numerical findings can only give an example of the phenomenon , and are , furthermore , limited by the number of basis functions employed . in the following ,",
    "we therefore analyze this behavior for @xmath5 in an analytic and more general way . to second order in @xmath75 , with @xmath97 , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ genfinalme ] ) the following set of equations ( @xmath98 ) @xmath99 from the latter equations",
    "one infers that the difference @xmath100 is of second order in @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we can replace the terms @xmath101 by @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ vibrinstab - one ] ) ( or vice versa in eq .",
    "( [ vibrinstab - two ] ) ) . subtracting eq .",
    "( [ vibrinstab - one ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ vibrinstab - two ] ) ( or vice versa ) thus gives @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "the recurrence relation defined by eq .",
    "( [ vibrinseries ] ) leads to divergent populations @xmath105 , if @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the only solution , which is normalizable , is the one , where all vibrational levels are equally occupied , @xmath107 .",
    "this corresponds to an infinite vibrational excitation or a vibrational instability in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "it is noted that rigorous divergence of the vibrational excitation is only found for an isolated molecular vibration , as it is described by the standard model of vibrationally coupled electron transport in molecular junctions considered here . in real molecular junctions ,",
    "vibrational relaxation processes , introduced _ e.g. _  by coupling to phonons of the electrodes or other vibrational modes , would restrict the vibrational excitation to a finite value .",
    "however , even in the presence of such relaxation mechanisms , vibrational excitation may not only monotonously increase with @xmath75 , but may also decrease with an increasing electronic - vibrational coupling strength .",
    "as in the high - bias limit , the current obtained for @xmath5 is also given by @xmath91 .",
    "for weak electronic - vibrational coupling , vibrational processes ( fig .",
    "[ simpleemissionandabsorption ] ) do not contribute to the current , as they take place on time scales much longer than electronic transport processes , _",
    "i.e. _ processes that do not include an energy - exchange of the traversing electron with the vibrational mode of the molecular bridge .      for bias voltages in the range @xmath108 ,",
    "the vibrational excitation of a mode coupled to a single electronic state remains finite in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "this is illustrated by the gray line in fig .",
    "[ cureofvibrinst ] , which has been obtained for the same parameters as considered above ( black line ) but with a smaller bias voltage @xmath109v .",
    "intriguingly , for @xmath5 , the level of vibrational excitation approaches a non - zero value .",
    "this result can be derived from the master equation ( [ genfinalme ] ) . for voltages with @xmath110 , we obtain the following set of equations @xmath111 with @xmath112 from eqs .",

    "finally , we note that for even lower bias voltages , @xmath116 , the current and the respective current - induced vibrational excitation vanish in the limit @xmath5 .      in this section ,",
    "we address the question whether resonant absorption processes with respect to a higher - lying electronic state provide a cooling mechanism @xcite that prevents the vibrational instability we observed for a single electronic state ( sec .",
    "[ vibrinstab ] ) .",
    "thereby , we assume the energy @xmath117 of the second electronic state to be larger than @xmath118 .",
    "if the second electronic state would be located within the bias window , @xmath119 , we would obtain the level of vibrational excitation , which results from transport through this state only , because the other electronic state decouples from the vibrational mode in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "model calculations shown by the dashed blue line in fig .  [ cureofvibrinst ] support this conjecture .",
    "the current - induced vibrational excitation of a vibrational mode that is coupled to a lower- and a higher - lying electronic state remains finite in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters of these calculation are the same as those for the black line considered in sec .",
    "[ vibrinstab ] , but include a higher lying - electronic state at @xmath120ev that is coupled to the vibrational mode with a coupling strength of @xmath121ev and to the leads in the same way as the lower - lying state .",

    "thereby , the populations @xmath128 and @xmath129 are treated as second order contributions @xmath130 , because the population of the higher - lying state requires a preceding resonant emission process with respect to the lower - lying state ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "since in the latter two of eqs .",
