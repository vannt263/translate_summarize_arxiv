    "we present a search for the standard model higgs boson decaying into tau - pairs in the invariant mass region 110 - 145 @xmath2 performed using events recorded by the cms experiment at the lhc in 2011 and 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb@xmath3 at a centre - of - mass energy of 7 tev and 19.4 fb@xmath3 at 8 tev  . since july 4th 2012 an experimental observation of a new boson of a mass around 125 @xmath2 and compatible with the standard model higgs boson hypothesis",
    "is established both by the atlas and cms collaborations ref .  ,  ,  .",
    "the observation of the higgs - like boson is predominantly based on its couplings to gauge bosons . to seek direct evidence for its fermionic couplings ,",
    "the search for the standard model higgs boson decaying into tau - pairs is a distinguished channel to be analyzed with the cms detector .",
    "the search is simultaneously performed in several final states of the decaying di - tau system , henceforth denoted as : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 declares the hadronically decaying tau final states . for each final state the events",
    "are then divided into several disjoint event categories in order to enhance the overall sensetivity by exploiting the distinct event topologies of the higgs production processes .",
    "major higgs production mechanisms considered are processes via gluon fusion , vector boson fusion and the vector boson associated production . the dedicated @xmath10 analyses exploiting the associated higgs productions ( see ref .  ) are not discussed in detail in this review , however are included in the results in figure  [ f1 ] and  [ f3 ] .",
    "the most sensitive category is the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) category where the event topology of standard model higgs production via vector boson fusion is exploited which is characterized by two high @xmath11 jets in the forward regions of the detector .",
    "in addition to the event and lepton selection criteria events in the vbf category are required to have two jets with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , having an invariant mass of @xmath14 , with a seperation in the pseudo - rapdity @xmath15 and no addtional jet with @xmath12 in the eta gap between the two corresponding jets .",
    "in addition a 1-jet category is defined .",
    "events with at least one jet with @xmath12 and @xmath13 are selected in this category , exluding events of the vbf category .",
    "the standard model higgs production via gluon fusion dominates the signal contribution in the 1-jet category .",
    "further the 0-jet category is defined for events with no jet with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this category is largely dominated by background processes and is used to constrain the backgrounds in the vbf and 1-jet categories .    for all categories a b - tagged jet with @xmath16 veto",
    "is applied to decouple the analysis from the mssm higgs search in the di - tau channel .",

    "are defined .    for the @xmath7 final state the @xmath19 background",
