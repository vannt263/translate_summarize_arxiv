    "the united kingdom infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) is a suite of five public surveys of varying depth and area coverage which began in may 2005 and are expected to continue until 2012 .",
    "these surveys all use the wide field camera ( wfcam , see casali et al.2007 ) on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . the design and the principal aims of the five ukidss surveys",
    "are described by lawrence et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , along with a brief example of data from each survey .",
    "the data are reduced and calibrated at the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) using a dedicated software pipeline ( irwin et al.2008 ) and are then transferred to the wfcam science archive ( hereafter the wsa , hambly et al.2008 ) in edinburgh . there , the data are ingested into a sophisticated sql database and detections in the different passbands are merged .",
    "the ukidss data are released as sql databases at intervals of six to twelve months . the area coverage and data quality of these releases",
    "are described by dye et al.(2006 , the early data release ) , warren et al.(2007a , the first data release ) and warren et al.(2007b , the second data release ) .",
    "in addition to the major releases , smaller batches of pipeline processed images and their associated fits binary source catalogues for individual passbands are released on a faster timescale , but with no quality control .",
    "the raw data are available through casu and the eso archive .",
    "the ukidss data are presently public to all professional astronomers in any eso member state .",
    "world access to the various data releases begins 18 months after each data release to eso .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a guide to the gps database in the wsa .",
    "we describe the properties of the data in detail , illustrating usage of the wsa tools and giving examples of how to combine gps data with data from other wavebands for maximum scientific benefit .",
    "this should be regarded as essential reading for those wishing to exploit the data .",
    "this paper describes the main gps - specific aspects of the ukidss database in one place .",
    "we note that neither the pipeline nor the wsa were designed explicitly for the gps but rather for the ukidss surveys as a whole .",
    "some compromises were made to produce an efficient database in a reasonable period of time and we describe their effects here .    the paper is structured as follows .",
    "in @xmath102 we summarize the survey design , including recent changes from the original plan described by lawrence et al .",
    "in @xmath103 we describe the properties of the gps dataset ( depth and stellar populations ) as a function of galactic location and source confusion . in @xmath104",
    "we present demonstration science results from the science verification programme and from dr2 that are designed to illustrate the variety of uses of gps data , in combination with data from other wavebands .",
    "finally , appendix a contains a detailed guide to the wsa for gps science .",
    "the guide illustrates how to use the parameters available in the gps database to best effect and describes the strengths and weaknesses of the data that are presently available .",
    "the gps is designed to cover the entire northern and equatorial galactic plane that is accessible to ukirt in a 10 degree wide band around the sky .",
    "there is also a narrower southern extension to the galactic centre and a 200 deg@xmath11 survey of the taurus - auriga - perseus ( tap ) molecular cloud complex , which lies off the plane and follows the contours of the @xmath12co gas mapped by ungerechts & thaddeus ( 1987 ) .",
    "the southern extension is narrower because of its poorer accessibility from mauna kea . in galactic coordinates ,",
    "the in - plane region is : @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 , @xmath14 ; and @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the section of the plane at @xmath7=107 to 141 is not covered because it lies north of dec=+60@xmath9 , a region of the sky that ukirt can not reach due to fundamental features of the telescope design .",
    "observations are made in the j , h and k bandpasses with total on - source integration times of 80s , 80s and 40s respectively .",
    "these integrations are made up of shorter exposures , employing a sub - pixel dithering strategy to fully sample the image profile ( see @xmath10a1.2 ) .",
    "wfcam has four spatially separated arrays , so a tiling strategy is employed to obtain images of contiguous areas of the sky ( see @xmath10a1.1 ) .",
    "the median 5@xmath18 depths in dr2 given by warren et al.(2007b ) are j=19.77 , h=19.00 , k=18.05 ( vega system ) . however ,",
    "the survey depth is spatially variable due to source confusion so these figures should be used with caution , see @xmath193 .",
    "data in the three filters are generally collected within an interval of 20 minutes for any point on the sky , in order to minimise the effects of any photometric variability on source colours and derived extinction .",
    "exceptions can occur ( in dr2 and later releases ) when data that failed quality control in only one or two filters were later repeated in only those filters . in these cases",
    "there will always be near contemporaneous fluxes in at least two filters which can be used to estimate intrinsic source colours and extinction .",
    "the tap molecular cloud component of the survey also includes observations in the 2.12  @xmath3 m ( 1 - 0 ) s(1 ) h@xmath4 filter , with a total on source integration time of 160s .",
    "the data reduction pipeline is described in irwin et al.(2008 ) , so we do not provide a full description here .",
    "some of the more significant details that may affect the data in unexpected ways are described in @xmath10a2 .",
    "one important aspect of the reduction that is worth reiterating here is the photometric calibration .",
    "the photometric zero points are bootstrapped from the 2mass point source catalogue , which is believed to provide a reliable photometric calibration over the whole sky ( skrutskie et al.2006 ) .",
    "if we assume that the 2mass calibration is perfect , the scatter in the derived zero points for the numerous 2mass stars used in each wfcam field indicates that the absolute accuracy of the ukidss photometric calibration in the j , h and k bandpasses is 1 - 2% in photometric conditions and 2 - 3% in non - photometric conditions ( hodgkin et al . , 2008 ,",
    "submitted ) . since the 2mass j ,",
    "h and ks filters are slightly different from the wfcam filters ( see hewett et al.2006 ) , photometric transformations are used to correct the zero points . from dr2",
    "onward , these transformations include extinction terms to correct for the fact that the colours of stars in the galactic plane are influenced by interstellar reddening as well as temperature and gravity ( warren et al.2007b ) .",
    "these transformations are included in @xmath10a2 for completeness .",
    "they should be used in preference to the preliminary transformations given in hewett et al.(2006 ) .",
    "ukidss astrometry is also calibrated using numerous bright 2mass stars in each field .",
    "the precision of the astrometric solution is typically 0.09 arcsec for gps data , as determined from the r.m.s .",
    "residuals of the stars to the fit ( see @xmath10a1.3 for details of how to determine the precision for specific fields ) .",
    "individual stars can of course have much less precise astrometry , owing to source confusion or low signal to noise ratio .    owing to source confusion",
    "the survey depth is spatially variable in the more crowded parts of the plane ( see @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence , in many regions of the plane the gps represents the deepest survey possible with ground based , seeing limited wide field instrumentation .",
    "deeper images can be obtained by using higher resolution cameras with smaller pixels in conditions of good seeing , but for the foreseeable future such cameras will not be able to cover large areas of the galactic plane .",
    "the sky coverage in the various data releases so far is described in the references given in @xmath21 .",
    "those areas of the plane at @xmath22 with three band coverage can be viewed as an interactive three colour mosaic at http://surveys.roe.ac.uk:8080/wsa/gps_mosaic.jsp , ( credit m.read ) where the finest spatial scale has 1pixels .      in early 2007",
    "there was a review of the ukidss project in response to a call for additional large observing proposals .",
    "this led to changes and reductions in the ukidss programme in order to accomodate the new observing campaigns .",
    "the original gps design ( lawrence et al.2007 ) also included two additional epochs of data in the k band only , which were intended to provide a long time baseline for proper motions and to detect high amplitude variable stars . following the 2007 review , further progress on these k -",
    "only scans of the survey area has been deferred until at least 2010 .",
    "some 500 deg@xmath0 of the plane have already been observed in the k - only mode during conditions of thin cirrus cloud ( defined as @xmath2320% drop in throughput ) , covering regions not yet observed in the main three band survey . since the ukidss photometry is calibrated using numerous 2mass sources in every field",
    "there is only a very small loss of precision for relative photometry ( at the millimagnitude level ) even when observing through thin cirrus ( hodgkin et al.2008 ) .",
    "the main jhk survey has been conducted in photometric conditions , in order to ensure maximum depth , but thin cirrus conditions ( @xmath2310% absorption ) may be accepted from late 2008 in order to assist timely completion of the survey .",
    "it was originally planned to observe a region 300  deg@xmath0 of tap molecular clouds three times : once in the j , h , k and h@xmath4 filters and twice more in the k and h@xmath4 filters , in order to measure the velocities and accelerations of protostellar jets .",
    "however this part of the survey was cancelled in the 2007 review of ukidss , at which point @xmath24150  deg@xmath0 of the region had been observed .",
    "nonetheless , the remainder of the tap region will observed in the z , y , j , h and k filters as part of the ongoing ukidss galactic clusters survey , which included the same region .",
    "observations of the tap region with the h@xmath4 filter are continuing via directors discretionary time and small observing programmes , with the aim of completing one pass of the denser cloud cores , with a total area of @xmath24200  deg@xmath0 .",
    "the tap area coverage is described in more detail in davis et al.(2008 ) , and the reduced data can be viewed at www.jach.hawaii.edu/ukirt/tap .",
    "in this section we present magnitude histograms , colour magnitude diagrams and two colour diagrams for representative fields throughout the survey region .",
    "we discuss the survey depth as a function of galactic coordinates and then describe the nature of the main galactic ( and extragalactic ) populations that are detected . the besanon galactic stellar population model ( robin et al.2003 )",
    "is used to help interpret the diagrams and we then compare some diagrams for the synthetic population with the real data .",
    "figures 1 to 13 show the results for 12 gps fields .",
    "the fields at @xmath2590@xmath9 are square boxes that are 0.2 degrees on a side in @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "the fields at @xmath2790@xmath9 are square boxes that are 0.5 degrees on a side in @xmath7 and @xmath26 , in order to provide similar sized samples to reveal the nature of the populations in these less crowded regions .",
    "all fields include data from at least 2 spatially separate wfcam multiframes and usually more .",
    "any errors in global photometric calibration would add to the scatter in these plots .",
    "however the quality of the 2mass - based photometric calibration is such that we see no obvious increase in scatter compared to data from individual wfcam arrays .",
    "figure 1 shows the magnitude histograms .",
    "visual inspection of the images shows that the fields at @xmath2790@xmath28 have less source confusion than the other fields and source confusion is insignificant for the two fields near @xmath7=170@xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding histograms represent the maximum intrinsic depth of the survey .",
    "we see that the modal depths in uncrowded fields are approximately k=17.75 to 18.0 , h=18.5 to 18.75 , j=19.4 to 19.65 .",
    "the variation is due to the variable seeing , sky brightness , thermal background and atmospheric transparency during the survey .",
    "these modal depths are slightly shallower than the 5@xmath18 depths quoted in @xmath102 : k=18.05 , h=19.00 , j=19.77 . the reasons for this are described in @xmath10a3 . by visually extrapolating the histograms and assuming that the decline at faint magnitudes is entirely due to limited sensitivity we estimate that the typical 90% completeness        ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,380 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,160 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,220 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    ( 200,120 )    ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    * *    limits in uncrowded fields are located at k=18.0 , h=18.75 , j=19.5 , with uncertainties of about 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "individual fields in the outer galaxy should always be within 0.3 magnitudes of these typical values , since only a modest range of observing conditions ( seeing and transparency ) is permitted , as described in the data release papers .",
    "we do not attempt a more precise quantification of the mode and spread of the sensitivity at this stage since there is limited data for the outer galaxy in dr2 , and the sensitivity in future data releases is likely to change slightly .",
    "the seeing conditions required to begin an observation at @xmath27107@xmath28 were relaxed from a maximum fwhm of 0.8 arcsec ( measured in the k bandpass ) to 1.0 arcsec from february 2007 in order to speed the survey progress .",
    "it is clear that the survey is much less sensitive near the galactic centre than in uncrowded fields .",
    "however the 90% completeness limits and modal magnitudes are usually degraded by no more than 1 magnitude in fields at @xmath2730@xmath9 , even in the mid - plane at @xmath26=0@xmath9 .",
    "the effects of extinction on the histograms are apparent in the change in the relative numbers of j , h and k band detections in different parts of the galaxy .",
    "the k band source density is the highest in the fields at @xmath2530@xmath9 . at @xmath2730@xmath9",
    "the h band source density is higher ( at least for the fields at @xmath291@xmath9 for which multi - band data presently exist ) .",
    "the source density in the j band becomes comparable to the h band at @xmath2790@xmath9 .",
    "the two colour diagrams and colour magnitude diagrams in figures 2 - 13 allow us to clearly identify the main stellar populations detected in the gps and detect changes in extinction as a function of distance along different lines of sight .",
    "some readers will be familiar with similar diagrams constructed from data in the denis and 2mass surveys ( e.g. ojha et al.2000 ) or from surveys of the stellar populations in external galaxies . in general ,",
    "the populations detected by the gps consist of less luminous stars than those in most previously published wide field infrared surveys .",
    "consequently , the diagrams look quite different and their interpretation is often less obvious than might be supposed .",
    "we have chosen to plot @xmath30 vs. _ ( j - k ) _ colour magnitudes since the other near infrared colours ( _ ( j - h ) _ and _ ( h - k ) _ ) provide less separation between the various stellar populations and add little to this discussion",
    ". in general , near infrared diagrams can separate the nearby late dwarf , distant early dwarf , and red giant populations , with more complex behaviour depending on the sightline .    in this section we first summarise the general properties of the two colour diagrams and then discuss the colour magnitude diagrams , beginning with the inner galactic fields .",
    "the two colour digrams for the inner galactic fields in figures 2 to 8 all show two parallel sequences of stars extending from the lower left to the upper right .",
    "the upper sequence is composed mainly of giants ( mostly of the type known as `` red clump giants '' ) while the lower sequence consists of dwarf stars .",
    "these long sequences are due to interstellar reddening : they lie _ approximately _ parallel to the reddening vector and can be used to estimate the interstellar extinction toward each star by comparing the observed colours with those of unreddened stars .",
    "the colours of a sample of unreddened main sequence and giant stars from hewett et al.(2006 ) are plotted in figure 5 for illustration , along with the reddening vector of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) .",
    "late type giants have @xmath240.15 - 0.3 mag larger _ ( j - h ) _ colours than dwarfs of the same spectral type , due to the effect of their low surface gravities on the opacity of the h@xmath31 molecular ion . the more distant dwarfs also tend to have earlier spectral types than the giants , which also contributes to the difference in _",
    "( j - h ) _ colours .",
    "a careful inspection of the reddened sequences of stars in the two colour diagrams shows that they are not quite straight lines .",
    "this is due to two effects .",
    "the first is that the nature of the detected stellar population shifts towards more luminous stars with increasing distance and reddening .",
    "the clump of stars seen at the lower left of most of the two colour diagrams is composed mainly of nearby g , k and early m type dwarfs , which have a high space density .",
    "as we move further along the dwarf sequence the population shifts towards early g , f and a type dwarfs , which have a lower space density but are detected at larger distances .",
    "the dwarf sequence ends at a lower reddening than the giant sequence because the dwarfs are less luminous .",
    "this change in populations means that the the dwarf sequence has a slightly shallower gradient than the reddening vector .",
    "the second reason that the gradient is not linear is that the effective bandpasses of the filters change with increasing reddening when observing a continuum source , so reddening vectors become curved as the extinction increases ( e.g. kaas et al.1999 ) .",
    "the precise form of the curve differs for sources with different spectra , so there is no universal reddening vector , see e.g. drew et al.(2005 ) .",
    "the giant sequence generally begins at a slightly higher reddening than the clump of nearby late type dwarfs , since giant stars have a lower space density .",
    "this population can in principle be used to measure the reddening curve for red clump giants .",
    "in general a standard linear interstellar reddening vector is adequate for most applications and this approach is used in this work . a more sophisticated approach using a model of the instrumental transmission and stellar model atmospheres",
    "will be developed in a future paper on galactic structure .",
    "all of the two colour diagrams show samples selected using the least complete , most reliable selection described in @xmath10a3 , with errors @xmath230.05 mag in the colours on each axis , in order to distinguish the closely spaced stellar populations . including fainter sources with less precise photometry simply increases the scatter in the diagrams , as shown in figure a1(a ) , and extends the dwarf and giant sequences to slightly higher reddening values at the upper right .",
    "by contrast , the colour magnitude diagrams show all the three band detections within the chosen axis ranges , except those classified as `` noise '' detections ( see @xmath10a3 ) .",
    "sources with more reliable photometry are shown in black , while sources with less precise photometry are shown in blue .",
    "sources are put in the `` less precise '' selection if they fail to satisfy any of the following criteria .",
    "( 1 ) photometric uncertainties @xmath230.2 mag in the two bands used in each diagram .",
    "the corresponding less precise sources are faint objects lying in a group at the bottom of each diagram .",
    "( 2 ) pperrbits@xmath23256 .",
    "this parameter is decribed in @xmath10a3 .",
    "most sources failing this criterion do so because they are flagged as close to saturation , and therefore lie in a group at the top of each diagram .",
    "inspection of the diagrams shows that they nonetheless often play a valuable role in defining the different stellar populations , indicating that the errors in their photometry need not be extreme .",
    "( 3 ) pstar@xmath80.9 .",
    "sources only fail this criterion if they appear significantly non - stellar in at least one of the three passbands , usually because they are either part of a marginally resolved stellar pair or a resolved external galaxy .",
    "marginally resolved stellar pairs are evenly spread among the sources with more reliable photometry but extend further to the left and right sides of the diagrams .",
    "the resolved galaxies are located in a group at the lower right of the colour magnitude diagrams .",
    "the extragalactic group is clearly seen only in the fields at @xmath32 .",
    "the colour magnitude diagrams all show at least two principal sequences of stars . on first inspection",
    ", one might suppose that these correspond to luminosity class v dwarfs on the left side of the diagrams and luminosity class iii red clump giants on the right .",
    "this is indeed the case for the inner galactic fields , which we will now discuss .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated in the outer galaxy , as we shall see later .    the main feature of the colour magnitude diagrams for @xmath7=15 , 31 , 55 and 98.4 ( see figures 3 to 11 ) is the division into two principal sequences corresponding to dwarfs on the left and giants on the right .",
    "the besanon model indicates that the majority of the giants are k1iii - k2iii types .",
    "these stars occupy a sharp and well defined peak in the absolute magnitude function of class iii giants , with absolute magnitude @xmath33=-1.65 ( e.g. lopez - corredoira et al.2002 ) , though we caution that both flux and colour have some dependence on metallicity and age ( salaris & girardi 2002 ; luck et al.2007 ; gullieuszik et al.2007 ) .",
    "these giants form the well defined `` red clump '' in h - r diagrams for globular clusters and galaxies toward which the extinction is fairly uniform .",
    "they are therefore a useful tracer of stellar distance , extinction and population density , ( see lopez - corredoira et al.2002 ) but only in fields in which they can be distinguished from dwarfs and other types of giant .",
    "the dwarf and giant sequences do not always show a smooth increase in reddening with distance .",
    "the giant sequences in the @xmath34=(55,1 ) and ( 55,0 ) fields ( see figures 8 and 7 ) show an abrupt increase in reddening between @xmath35=13 and @xmath35=14 .",
    "such features can be explained by discrete clouds of interstellar dust .",
    "a similar feature occurs in the @xmath34=(15,0 ) field ( figure 3 ) , where there is a sudden increase in reddening at @xmath35=12.75 , _ ( j - k)_=2.25 .",
    "the distance to the cloud and the extinction in front of it and within it can be simply determined from the known luminosity and colour of the red clump giants and by adopting an extinction law that is appropriate for the diffuse interstellar medium ( e.g. rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "( here we neglect the effect of the change in effective bandpasses at high extinction that were mentioned above ) . in the case of the field at @xmath34=(55,1 )",
    "the cloud is located at a heliocentric distance of 8  kpc and it introduces a visual extinction of a@xmath36=7.5 magnitudes . since the feature at @xmath35=13 - 14 is well populated with red clump giants it is likely to be caused by a large cloud of atomic gas rather than a relatively small dense molecular cloud .",
    "inspection of the @xmath12co data cube from the bu - fcrao survey ( see e.g. shah et al.2004 ) shows weak but uniform emission across the field , with much brighter emission outside the field on both sides .",
    "the emission is too weak by more than an order of magnitude to explain the infrared extinction , which tends to support the interpretation of the cloud as an atomic feature rather than a molecular one .",
    "an advantage of the near infared determination of extinction ( as opposed to optical determinations ) is that a `` universal '' extinction law applies to both the diffuse interstellar medium and molecular clouds ( cardelli et al.1989 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dust grains responsible for extinction have a size much smaller than the wavelength of observation for wavelengths @xmath37 m ( except in extreme environments such as the accretion discs around protostars ) .",
    "small variations in the extinction law can still occur , e.g. due to variations in grain composition ( and hence refractive index ) .",
    "this may explain why some authors have found values of the colour excess ratio e(j - h)/e(h - k ) ranging from 1.32 to 2.08 in some dark clouds ( e.g. moore et al.2005 ; racca , gmez & kenyon 2002 ) , bracketing the value of 1.70 found in rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) .",
    "however , most measurements , e.g. naoi et al.(2006 ) find that e(j - h)/e(h - k ) lies in the range 1.6 to 1.7 , and they note that some of the reported variations are attributable to differences in photometric systems .    some of the colour magnitude diagrams show an abrupt change in the slope of the giant branch for another reason . for example , the plots in figures 4 and 9 for @xmath34=(15,1 ) and ( 98.4,0 ) show diagonal sequences of red clump giants at @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , and then a change to an almost vertical giant sequence at fainter magnitudes .",
    "this change is due to the red clump giant population leaving the main body of the galactic disk at large distances .",
    "the position of stars along the red clump giant sequence is determined mainly by distance . at heliocentric distances",
    "@xmath4012  kpc , the sequence in the @xmath34=(15,1 ) plot rises far enough above the dusty galactic plane for extinction to become almost independent of distance .",
    "the similar behaviour of the @xmath34=(98.4,0 ) plot is attributed to the northern galactic warp , which moves the dusty plane away from @xmath26=0 at large galactocentric radii . in figure 15",
    "we show a besanon model for @xmath34=(15,1 ) which reproduces and clarifies the behaviour at @xmath4012  kpc .",
    "we see that the red clump giants are split into a number of faint parallel sub - sequences .",
    "these correspond to the various evolutionary groups : core helium burning horizontal branch giants , fainter hydrogen shell burning stars ascending the red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars with hydrogen and helium shell burning ( e.g. robin 1989 ) .",
    "each evolutionary group is also split into multiple sequences due to binning by spectral sub - type in the besanon model .",
    "each sequence has a slightly different effective temperature and some , e.g. the k type red giant branch sequences , have lower luminosities . at @xmath4012",
    "kpc the sub - sequences continue to become slightly redder at fainter magnitudes ( i.e. larger distances ) since there is a small amount of dust above the galactic plane .",
    "however the sub - sequences all end @xmath242 magnitudes below the change in slope , as the old disc population declines to zero at large distances above the plane . at fainter magnitudes , new sub - sequences of slightly fainter giants with slightly bluer _ ( j - k ) _ colours ( which we believe are stars ascending the red giant branch ) come to dominate the giant branch . in the gps data the adjacent sub - sequences merge together , with the result that in the vertical part of the giant sequence the stars become slightly bluer in _ ( j - k ) _ colour at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the existence of less luminous hydrogen shell burning stars in the red clump indicates that the red clump method for determining distances , extinction and stellar population density should be used with caution at faint magnitudes .",
    "the besanon model catalogue displayed in figure 15 for ( l , b)=(15,1 ) indicates that at m@xmath4115.5 these less luminous giants dominate the red clump .",
    "the field near the galactic centre at @xmath34=(-0.3,0 ) has a rather different colour magnitude diagram from the other fields .",
    "three principal sequences are apparent in figure 2 .",
    "the largest population is giants in the galactic bulge , with @xmath42_(j - k)_@xmath43 .",
    "according to the besanon model these have a wide range of spectral types and metallicities .",
    "however most suffer similar reddening , since they are all at distances of 7 - 10  kpc ( according to the model ) .",
    "the other populations are the nearby disc dwarfs at the left side of the diagram and the disc red clump giants , which form a diagonal sequence with _",
    "( j - k ) _ colours intermediate between the other two groups .    moving to the outer galactic fields , we consider first the diagrams in figure 12 , for @xmath34=(171.1 , 4.75 ) .",
    "this shows a field with negligble reddening , which can be discerned from the corresponding two colour diagram .",
    "two principal sequences of stars are apparent in the corresponding colour magnitude diagram , mostly with reliable photometry .",
    "a more diffuse clump of sources with `` less reliable '' photometry is situated near _ ( j - k)_@xmath441.8 ,",
    "this clump is composed of external galaxies ( mergedclass=+1 , pstar@xmath45 0.9 ) , and the corresponding luminosity function increases down to the completeness limit ( see @xmath104.5 ) .",
    "inspection of the besanon model catalogue for these coordinates ( plotted in the lower panels of figure 14 ) indicates that the overwhelming majority of the sources in both of the two principal sequences are actually luminosity class v dwarfs .",
    "the left hand sequence is composed of f and g type dwarfs ( and some subgiants of luminosity class iv ) .",
    "the right hand sequence is composed mainly of m and late k type dwarfs , with only a small proportion of giant stars .",
    "luminosity class iii giants are restricted to the upper portion of the right hand sequence with @xmath4613.5 .",
    "the dwarf component of this sequence begins at @xmath4712 and extends down to the faintest sources at the bottom of the diagram .",
    "the overlapping dwarf and giant populations in the right hand sequence are not distinguishable in the magnitude range 12@xmath4813.5 .",
    "the two colour diagram also fails to separate them , although it should in principle reveal any large population of early k - type red clump giants as an overdensity near _ ( j - h)_=0.57 , _ ( h - k)_=0.12 .",
    "the reason that two sequences of dwarf stars are detected at @xmath34=(171.1 , 4.75 ) is not immediately obvious .",
    "inspection of the density map of the colour magnitude diagram shown in the lower panel of figure 12 ( a `` hess diagram '' ) and the besanon model shows that there is a connection between the two sequences at 17@xmath4818 .",
    "however , the m type dwarfs , which are the most numerous population in the diagram , extend above and below this connection .",
    "nearby late k and early m - type dwarfs have a narrow range of colours ( _ ( j - k)_@xmath440.9 ) and they are sufficiently numerous to define the right hand dwarf branch at 12@xmath4817 . similarly the distant f and early g - type dwarfs observed in this magnitude range also have a narrow range of colours .",
    "by contrast the late g and early k type dwarfs are spread over a wider range of _ ( j - k ) _ colours due to the steeper colour - temperature relation for these types .",
    "their numbers are similar to the earlier type dwarfs in this magnitude range , so the rapid change in colour with temperature creates the sparsely populated gap between the two branches and the bimodal colour distribution . at @xmath35@xmath817",
    "the late g and early k type dwarfs are sufficiently numerous to fill the gap .",
    "the two sequences of dwarfs are present in all the colour magnitude diagrams plotted but they are less obvious at @xmath49 .",
    "this is due to a combination of factors : ( i ) detectable f and g type dwarfs greatly outnumber m dwarfs near the mid - plane at @xmath49 ; ( ii ) there is a trend of increasing reddening with decreasing galactic longitude , which causes the distant highly reddened f and g dwarf sequence to merge with k and m dwarf sequence ; ( iii ) the population of distant red clump giants is much larger and produces a more obvious second sequence of stars to the right of the dwarf sequence that is clearly separated from the common f , g , k and m type dwarfs by high reddening .",
    "the k and m type dwarf branch is still detectable in some of the colour magnitude diagrams for @xmath7=98.4 and @xmath7=55 ( see figures 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 ) appearing as a faint protuberance above the mass of dwarfs at @xmath50 .",
    "the clump of external galaxies seen in the colour magnitude diagrams for the @xmath32 fields is not detected at smaller longitudes , owing to the combination of higher extinction through the plane and the reduced sensitivity caused by source confusion .",
    "the two colour diagrams show clearly the trend of increasing extinction with decreasing galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "the dependence on galactic latitude is apparent even in the outer galaxy , where extinction is relatively low . in the @xmath34=(171.1 , 4.75 )",
    "field ( see figure 12 ) the densest cluster of sources near _ ( j - h)_=0.4 is composed of f and g type dwarfs . in the @xmath34=(173.65,0.65 ) field",
    "( see figure 13 ) , we see that the f and g types have moved up to _ ( j - h)_=0.5 , owing to the significant extinction present in the mid - plane toward these relatively distant sources ( 1 to 6 kpc ) . by contrast , the k and m type dwarfs with _ ( j - h)_=0.5 to 0.7 lie in the same place in both diagrams , owing to the much lower extinction toward these nearer and intrinsically fainter sources ( @xmath233  kpc distance ) .",
    "the effect of the northern galactic warp is apparent in the two colour diagrams for @xmath7=98.4 .",
    "the extinction at @xmath34=(98.4,1 ) is similar to that at @xmath34=(98.4,0 ) and clearly greater than that at @xmath34=(98.4,-1 ) , as shown in figures 9 , 10 and 11 .",
    "the besanon stellar population model has been used to aid the interpretion of the gps data discussed above . in figures 14 and 15",
    "we show some of the diagrams produced by the model in order to illustrate the quality and the limitations of such comparisons .",
    "the results in figure 14 have synthetic errors included in the simulation .",
    "the error curve used was based on a fit to the errors as a function of magnitude given in the wsa for each passband in the appropriate field . as noted in @xmath10a2 , this will tend to underestimate the true errors ( particularly for bright stars ) , but it is adequate for a simple comparison .",
    "the visual extinction per kiloparsec in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) is a free parameter in the besanon models .",
    "discrete clouds may also be added to model strong extinction features , as noted earlier .",
    "the ism extinction parameter was adjusted by trial and error until the best combined match by eye to the observed luminosity function and the k vs._(j - k ) _ colour magnitude diagram was produced .",
    "the derived extinction was a@xmath36=2.25 mag / kpc for the ( @xmath51)=(31,0 ) simulation and a@xmath36=0.7 mag / kpc for the ( @xmath51)=(171.1,4.75 ) simulation .",
    "the models use the extinction law of mathis ( 1990 ) , assuming r@xmath36=3.1 , so the equivalent k band extinctions are a@xmath41=0.242 mag / kpc and a@xmath41=0.075 mag / kpc .",
    "the default value of a@xmath36=0.7 mag / kpc is appropriate for the diffuse ism and will usually be correct in fields with low extinction .",
    "higher values are required to fit fields with high extinction . in reality",
    "high extinction is expected to be caused by numerous discrete molecular clouds , but often the individual clouds have too small an effect to be resolved in the data .",
    "we note that some authors quote a slightly higher value for the extinction in the diffuse ism , e.g. whittet ( 1990 ) quotes 0.8 mag / kpc .",
    "this difference is likely to be due to the choice of distance scale in the besanon models , which places the galactic centre at @xmath52=8.5  kpc from the sun .",
    "the distance to the supermassive black hole at the galactic centre has been reliably determined by matching the observed angular size of stellar orbits to the corresponding stellar radial velocities : @xmath52=7.62@xmath530.32  kpc ( eisenhauer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "hence some users may prefer to scale the besanon distances and extinction values accordingly .",
    "the two colour diagrams in figure 14 for ( @xmath51)=(31,0 ) and ( 171.1,4.75 ) are a good quantitative match to the data .",
    "the blue end of the model dwarf sequence for ( @xmath51)=(171.1,4.75 ) appears sharper than the observed sequence in figure 12 , since the photometric errors of these hot and bright stars are underestimated in the model .",
    "the other noticeable discrepancies in the ( 171.1,4.75 ) plot are : ( i ) the appearance of a cluster of sources at the upper right of the diagram ( _ ( h - k)_=0.45 , _",
    "( j - h)_=0.85 ) , which is not observed ; and ( ii ) the sparesely populated sequence of stars extending off the top of the diagram at _ ( h - k)_=0.2 - 0.25 .",
    "the first group represents k type white dwarf stars in the model , which all have very similar masses and spectral types .",
    "the data suggests that the real white dwarf population has less uniform parameters than in the model .",
    "the second group represents late k - type giants in the model .",
    "these are not included in figure 12 because they are too bright ( i.e. heavily saturated sources ) .",
    "the two colour diagram for the ( @xmath51)=(31,0 ) model shows a similar small population of luminous giants at _ ( h - k)_=2.5 - 3.0 ( late m - types in that case ) that is not seen in figure 5 for the same reason .",
    "such bright populations are better studied with the 2mass or denis surveys .",
    "the colour magnitude diagram for the ( @xmath51)=(31,0 ) model is in close agreement with the data in figure 5 .",
    "the only difference is that slope of the red clump giant sequence at the upper right is more constant in the model than in reality .",
    "this reflects the patchy nature of interstellar extinction .",
    "the colour magnitude diagram for the ( @xmath51)=(171.1,4.75 ) model is also in fair agreement with the corresponding data in figure 12 .",
    "the following differences are obvious however .",
    "( 1 ) the external galaxies at the bottom right of the plot in figure 12 are not in the besanon model .",
    "( 2 ) the two sequences of dwarf stars discussed earlier appear as three sequences at 0.45@xmath23_(j - k)_@xmath230.9 in the model . the sparsely populated middle sequence at _ ( j - k)_=0.65 corresponds to early k dwarfs in the model .",
    "this may well be a real feature but it is not apparent in figure 12 due to the larger photometric errors in the real data .",
    "( 3 ) the short vertical sequence of red sources at _ ( j - k)_=1.25 seen in the model are the k - type white dwarfs ; these are not seen in the data , as noted earlier .    in figure 15",
    "we show besanon synthetic colour magnitude diagrams with no errors added , for @xmath34=(31,0 ) and ( 15,1 ) .",
    "these illustrate the discrete binning of sources in the besanon model grid .",
    "the synthetic plots for @xmath34=(31,0 ) appear very similar in figures 14 and 15 since distance and interstellar reddening introduce numerous degeneracies in magnitude and colour between different spectral types .",
    "in contrast , the plot for @xmath34=(15,1 ) clearly shows the numerous red clump giant sub - sequences ( see discussion in @xmath103.2 ) .",
    "these appear well defined in the model because each sub - type of giant star has a unique luminosity , effective temperature and colour in the model and there is no additional extinction to merge the sub - sequences in the dust free region above the galactic plane .",
    "some of the numerous sub - sequences correspond to the various evolutionary stages on the hr diagram , as noted earlier .",
    "in addition , the effect of binning by spectral sub - type in the model creates an artificial division which further multiplies the number of sub - sequences .",
    "we note that the more luminous giants above the most populated part of the red giant clump appear to be more numerous in the data than the model .",
    "one of the principal science goals of the gps is to detect and characterise large numbers of star formation regions , in order to examine the effect of environment on star formation .",
    "young stellar objects ( ysos ) can be identified and classified by the excess emission from hot dust around the central protostar at wavelengths @xmath54 m .",
    "the gps can detect this excess in some ysos by using the _ ( j - h ) _ vs._(h - k ) _ two colour diagram .",
    "however , the excess is larger and therefore more easily measured at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "mid - ir data from the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "alone can be used to identify and classify ysos ( e.g. whitney et al.2004 ; churchwell et al.2004 ; allen et al.2004 ; megeath et al.2004 ) .",
    "however , this requires a detection in three or four _ spitzer_-irac passbands and the relatively poor sensitivity and spatial resolution of the longer wavelength passbands at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath3 m limits the number of ysos that can be classified .",
    "there is therefore a natural synergy between the gps and the mid - ir _ spitzer _ glimpse legacy survey of the mid - plane ( benjamin et al.2003 ) , particularly since the 2mass survey generally has insufficient depth to adequately match glimpse in star formation regions .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 16 for the young cluster g28.983 - 0.603 , which is coincident with an hii region observed by lockman ( 1989 ) .",
    "this cluster was identified by bica et al.(2003 ) using 2mass data and is listed as cluster 10 in their catalogue",
    ". a fair number of ysos are identified via their k band excesses in the near ir two colour diagram ( lower left panel ) , lying to the right of the principal sequence of reddened field stars and the more evolved `` discless '' class iii ysos .",
    "however , the median _ ( h - k ) _ colour excess of ysos is only @xmath55 magnitudes ( e.g. wilking , greene & meyer 1999 ) , so it is hard to distinguish cluster members with modest k band excesses from field stars .",
    "the lower right hand panel shows that the ysos are far more clearly identified by using the ( k-4.5 ) colour ( many showing excesses @xmath80.5  magnitudes ) where the 4.5  @xmath3 m flux comes from _ spitzer_/irac band 2 .",
    "the horizontal axis in the lower right panel gives the approximate visual extinction , estimated from the _ ( h - k ) _ colour . in the lower right panel",
    "we plot the 1345 sources within a 6@xmath566 arcminute box centred on the cluster that are detected in all of the @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath30 , 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath3 m bands as filled circles .",
    "sources which lack a @xmath57 band detection are plotted as open circles .",
    "a 0.5 arcsec matching radius was used to combine the gps and glimpse data , since the default ipac matching radius of 1.2 arcsec was found to create numerous false matches in this crowded field .",
    "we note that there are only 128 four band _",
    "spitzer_-irac detections in this field , so the near ir / mid - ir combination increases the sample size by an order of magnitude .",
    "there is also an order of magnitude increase in the sample size for the ysos .",
    "the sources in the lower right panel of figure 16 are divided into class i ysos , class ii ysos and class iii / field stars according to their @xmath30 - 4.5  @xmath3 m excess by straight lines that are parallel to the reddening vector .",
    "the class iii / field stars form a continuous sequence parallel to the reddening vector but show an abrupt increase in the source density at a@xmath59 .",
    "sources with a ( @xmath30 - 4.5 ) excess are also located mostly at a@xmath59 ( typically at @xmath60 ) so we can infer that the cluster lies behind 12 magnitudes of visual extinction and that there is significant extinction within the cluster . thus the near ir data allow us to identify stars with @xmath61 as the most likely cluster members .",
    "lockman ( 1989 ) measured a radial velocity of 52.6@xmath531.3 km / s for the hii region . adopting a galactic rotation model with a rotation speed of 220 km / s and 7.62  kpc as the distance to the galactic centre ( eisenhauer et al.2005 ) we derive a kinematic distance of 3.1  kpc or 10.2  kpc .",
    "inspection of the @xmath30 vs. _ ( j - k ) _ colour magnitude diagram for stars in the same wfcam field indicates a preference for the closer distance .",
    "this is because of stars in the red giant branch with a@xmath36@xmath4412 have m@xmath41=12 - 14 , corresponding to distances of 2.9 - 7.3  kpc .",
    "the large spread is due to highly variable extinction across the field .",
    "the cluster lies in a extensive region of high extinction oriented east - west across the field , so m@xmath41@xmath4412 and d@xmath243  kpc is a reasonable distance to derive using the red giant branch and this is consistent with the nearer kinematic distance .",
    "the gps data are fully complete to m@xmath41@xmath4416.0 in this crowded field and are @xmath2450% complete to m@xmath41=17.25 . at d=3.1",
    "kpc , m@xmath41=17.25 corresponds to very low mass pre - main sequence stars with masses as low as m@xmath240.095  m@xmath62 ( using the nextgen isochrone of baraffe et al.1998 for an age of 1 myr ) in the absence of extinction . such sources would be detected if they were ejected from the region of high extinction in which most of the cluster lies . for cluster members with a more typical extinction of a@xmath36=21 ( a@xmath41=2.35 )",
    ", the 50% completeness limit corresponds to low mass stars with m@xmath240.5  m@xmath62 .",
    "the locations of the dividing lines were determined using information from gutermuth ( 2005 ) in which class i , class ii and class iii ysos ( with classifications determined from 4 band irac detections ) were plotted in the dereddened ( @xmath30 - 3.6 ) vs. ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) two colour diagram .",
    "gutermuth ( 2005 ) found that the different yso classes were easily located in that diagram since the colours correlated excellently with the colours in the ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) vs.(5.8 - 8.0 ) irac two colour diagram .",
    "the near ir and mid - ir passbands with the best sensitivity to reddened young stars are @xmath58 , @xmath30 , 3.6  @xmath3 m and 4.5  @xmath3 m .",
    "gutermuth ( 2005 ) therefore devised a sophisticated scheme to classify the numerous ysos detected in only these 4 passbands . to briefly summarise the method",
    ", he dereddened sources with @xmath57 band detections to the classical t tauri locus of meyer , calvet & hillenbrand in the _ ( h - k ) _ vs. _ ( j - h ) _ diagram and thereby determined the individual extinction values .",
    "he used that information to plot ysos in a dereddened _ ( h - k ) _ vs. ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) two colour diagram and find the the best fit locus of yso colours . the larger sample of sources which lack @xmath57 band detections were then dereddened to this locus in the observed _ ( h - k ) _ vs. ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) diagram , taking advantage of the fact that the locus is inclined to the reddening vector by a large angle in that diagram .",
    "finally , he used the extinction values for the full sample to classify yso candidates using their location in the dereddened ( @xmath30 - 3.6 ) vs. ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) diagram .",
    "this diagram was found to be the best diagram for clasifying ysos , owing to the significant infrared excesses of protostars on both axes .    in the lower right panel of figure 16",
    "we have used a scheme which is simpler in some ways but is more effective in crowded gps / glimpse fields .",
    "we find that the dereddened ( @xmath30 - 3.6 ) vs. ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) diagram does not readily detect the ysos in this field due to the far larger number of field stars and the large uncertainties in the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath3 m fluxes , which cause many stars to scatter into the region occupied by ysos .",
    "these large uncertainties are due to the fact that the glimpse legacy survey is shallower than most _ spitzer _ go observing programmes : it was designed to provide quite literally a glimpse of a very large area of the galactic plane . in comparison",
    "the go programmes also usually have fewer field stars contaminating the sample since the nearby star formation regions in the gould belt often lie off the galactic plane .",
    "we use a simpler formula for extinction : ( @xmath63 ) , which is based on the extinction law of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , with _",
    "( h - k)_=0.2 adopted as the typical intrinsic colour of most stars .",
    "this formula does not take account of the fact that ysos will have an _ ( h - k ) _ excess due to hot circumstellar dust .",
    "however , by avoiding use of the glimpse fluxes in calculating extinction we greatly reduce the scatter in the lower right panel of figure 16 .",
    "like gutermuth , we use the extinction law of flaherty et al.(2007 ) to determine the extinction in the mid - ir bandpasses , relative to the k band .",
    "flaherty et al.(2007 ) report a possible difference in the extinction law for dark clouds and for the interstellar medium , the latter being calculated by reanalysing the data of indebetouw et al.(2005 ) .",
    "the difference could increase the gradient of the dividing lines in the lower right panel of figure 16 by 5% , leading to a different classification for a small number of sources .",
    "we note that the common method of dereddening to the classical t tauri star ( ctts ) locus of meyer et al.(1997 ) runs into difficulties in gps datasets containing a variety of dwarf and giant field stars that do not lie on the locus . in any case",
    ", the ctts locus requires fluxes in the @xmath57 bandpass , which are often unavailable .",
    "we therefore recommend the use of diagrams similar to the lower right panel of figure 16 for simple classification of yso candidates in gps data .",
    "the extinction axis helps to identify stars that are likely to lie in front of or behind the cluster and the ( @xmath30 - 4.5 ) colour contains most of the information in the dereddened ( @xmath30 - 3.6 ) vs. ( 3.6 - 4.5 ) diagram .",
    "the use of the _ ( h - k ) _ colour to determine extinction will lead to a systematic overestimate of the extinction towards ysos , but a typical _ ( h - k ) _ excess of 0.2 magnitudes will lead an overestimate of only 3 magnitudes in the extinction , which is small in the context of figure 16 . after the likely ysos",
    "have been identified this bias can be allowed for .",
    "we caution that there are limits outside which these yso clasifications become unreliable .",
    "gutermuth ( 2005 and private comm . ) noted that his classification system was calibrated using low mass protostars .",
    "it is not calibrated for more massive ysos ( herbig ae / be stars ) or for proto - brown dwarfs , which the class i / ii / iii system of lada et al.(1984 ) was not designed for . herbig",

    "a single wfcam tile was observed in the three near ir passbands , using the same total exposure times as the gps .",
    "the central portion of the k band image is shown in figure 18 .",
    "it was noted in lawrence et al.(2007 ) ( see also @xmath10a2 ) that the wsa fails to include almost all the stars that are apparent in the regions of brightest nebulosity .",
    "this is due to a limitation of the source detection algorithm in the casu reduction pipeline that is planned to be fixed from dr5 onward .",
    "here we show the results of our own crowded field profile fitting photometry of the images from the wsa with iraf / daophot and a comparison with the published data of jiang et al.(2002 ) , which covered a much smaller part of the same field .",
    "only the central 4 arrays out of the 16 in the wfcam tile contain bright nebulosity , and then only in a minority of each array .",
    "we used a 5@xmath18 threshold for the source detection with daofind for each array in each filter .",
    "visual inspection showed that this produced very few spurious detections .",
    "image profiles were generated using @xmath2415 isolated stars in each array , assuming a spatially independent profile .",
    "the photometry was calibrated by comparison with the wsa catalogue for each array , using the median zero point correction for the sources common to both catalogues . finally , the photometry for these four arrays was band merged in topcat with a 0.5 arcsec pair matching radius and then merged with the wsa catalogue for the other 12 arrays in the tile .",
    "a total of 788841 sources were detected in the gps field .    in figure 17(a - b ) we show the linear and cumulative @xmath30-band luminosity functions ( lfs ) of regions 1c , 1n , 1s and 2c defined by jiang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( these are illustrated in the right hand panel of figure 18 . ) while the overall lfs exhibit similar characteristics to those in figure 7 of jiang et al . , figure 17(c ) shows quantitatively to what extent both sets of lfs are in agreement .",
    "in general , the wfcam - derived lfs contain more objects at fainter @xmath30-band magnitudes than those of jiang et al . , and reach a similar limiting magnitude .",
    "the number of sources detected in each region in the gps data is ( 1047 , 7402 , 3658 and 1711 ) for ( 1c , 1n , 1s and 2c ) respectively .",
    "this compares with figures of ( 528 , 2584 , 1588 and 1367 ) for the same regions in jiang et al.(2002 ) .",
    "the excess of objects in our lfs is most likely due to the superior spatial resolution of ukirt , relative to the set up used by jiang et al .",
    "our wfcam observations are characterised by about 0.8 arcsec fwhm and have 0.2 arcsec pixel sampling after microstepping .",
    "this compares very favourably with the 0.45 arcsec pixels of the sirius camera on the infrared survey facility used by jiang et al .",
    ", which is located at a site in south africa with a typical seeing of 1.5 arcsec fwhm .",
    "this is supported by figure 17(c ) : region 1c exhibits the highest stellar density , and shows a systematically greater number of objects in our lfs compared to those of jiang et al .",
    ", for @xmath64 mag down to the detection limit of both sets of observations .",
    "regions 1n and 1s , coinciding with the northern and southern nebular regions near the core of m17 , also have fairly high - density subregions .",
    "as such the excess of fainter sources ( @xmath65 mag ) compared to jiang et al .  in particular in region 1n  is not surprising if we assume that the difference in spatial resolution is the driving force behind this behaviour .",
    "an effect of the larger number of detections in the ukidss data is to shift the peak of the lfs in the crowded regions 1c and 1s to fainter magnitudes than in jiang et al.(2002 ) . in that publication",
    "the authors were unsure whether the different locations of the peaks in the different regions were due to an actual property of the regions or to issues of depth and spatial resolution .",
    "it now seems clear that the differences are caused by spatial resolution effects , and still deeper observations with even higher resolution will be required to search for any genuine differences .    in figure 18",
    "we show an extinction map of the region .",
    "this was generated by calculating the extinction towards each individual star and averaging the results in 15 arcsecond bins , then gaussian smoothing the results with a fwhm of 1.5 bins .",

    "the extinction derived by this method is low , evinced by the white regions with the darkest parts of the map .",
    "this is because the densest part of the molecular cloud obscures all the background stars that dominate the star counts in most other parts of the map , so only foreground stars with low extinction are detected .",

    "comparison with the k band image in the right hand panel of figure 18 shows that the @xmath66 shape of high extinction ( i.e. the giant molecular cloud ) follows the outer rim of the hii region , which is ionised by the cluster located in region 1c .",

    "these data were taken as part of ukidss gps science verification in april 2005 with the same integration times as the tap survey ( see @xmath67 ) , covering a 52@xmath5652 arcminute field .",
    "the @xmath6 ophiuchi cloud has been the focus of many programmes to understand the formation of low - mass stars .",
    "while it is difficult to detect the youngest ysos ( class 0 protostars ) because their near ir radiation is obscured by the material from which they form , prodigious outflowing streams of molecules are often visible at near infrared wavelengths         the wfcam data have uncovered a number of new parts of these flows . whereas previous surveys attributed the driving sources to be within a few arcminutes , the wide field makes it possible to piece together outflows which may extend over 30 arcminutes corresponding to parsec scale flows .",
    "two such outflows are indicated in figure 19 .",
    "the data suggest that much of what we see spread out on the largest scale in @xmath6 ophiuchi is actually driven from a single active clump .",
    "one can then determine the true number of outflows and determine their full extent . with the aid of future epochs of observation it will be possible measure their velocity and hence estimate their ages and calculate the feedback of mechanical energy into the cloud .",
    "similar parsec scale flows associated with low mass star formation have been identified in several other nearby molecular clouds , ( e.g. bally & devine 1994 ; devine 1997 ) .    in figure 19",
    "the red patches mainly correspond to the locations where the outflows impact with the environment , creating compressed layers of shocked h@xmath4 revealed by the 2.12  @xmath3 m filter .",
    "blue and green correspond to j band and k band respectively . despite their large spatial extent , these flows have dynamical lifetimes that are only of order 10@xmath68 years , assuming typical flow velocities of 100 - 200  km / s . since the outflows appear to be driven from a single clump",
    "this suggests that only a few protostars are driving them .",
    "the fact that most of the pre - main sequence stars in the cloud do not seem to be generating detectable molecular outflows suggests that the active stage of protostellar accretion is extremely short , presumably of the same order as the dynamical timescale inferred from the extent of the jets detected in these data .",

    "the extremely high , variable extinction towards the nuclear bulge requires these observations to be performed in the infrared .",

    "those with @xmath77 errors have a slightly larger proportion with 2 candidate counterparts .",
    "as might be expected , the sources with the larger error circles , @xmath78 , have a much larger proportion with multiple candidate counterparts .",

    "the saturation limits in the gps vary depending on the sky background and seeing .",

    "the saturation limit for individual fields can be determined with the pperrbits parameters in the wsa ( see @xmath10a2 ) but here we used the above thresholds for simplicity .    from the diagrams",
    "it can be seen that the x - ray sources  follow the general trend of the overall stellar distribution but with some differences to their specific distribution . in particular , the cmds containing @xmath57 band data reveal a disproportionately high proportion of the candidate counterparts to be in the local , main sequence arm of the cmds ( see @xmath103.2 for discussion and analysis of the cmds of the bulge ) .",
    "the majority of the remaining candidate counterparts in all three cmds are consistent with red giants at the distance of the bulge with variable levels of extinction .",

    "the large proportion of single x - ray band detections ( black points ) in the local dwarf branch is mainly due to sources detected only in the 4.7kev band , which is consistent with these being mostly soft x - ray sources .",
    "based on the identification of candidate counterparts to these x - ray sources , we can draw some early conclusions as to the likely nature of the different populations of x - ray sources .",
    "we can separate the sources into those with local dwarf candidate counterparts and those with bulge giants when analysing the populations .",
    "we noted above that the local dwarf candidate counterparts have a higher likelihood to be associated with x - ray sources  with low values of hard colour , indicating either an intrinsically soft spectrum or low absorption .",
    "since local dwarfs make up only a small fraction of the total number of sources in this nuclear bulge  field , the fact that they are disproportionately represented among the candidate x - ray source  counterparts indicates that these are almost certainly genuine matches , most likely cvs or x - ray active stars . for the x - ray sources  with nuclear bulge  giant counterparts , we see a generally higher value for the x - ray source  colour indicating a harder or more absorbed x - ray spectrum in line with the higher level of absorption expected for the nuclear bulge  x - ray source  population . the very high stellar density ( average separation of 2.8 in the gps and 1.94@xmath70 at @xmath85 ; gosling et al.2006 )",
    "does mean that a fraction of the bulge candidate counterparts will be chance positional coincidences , but the correlation of `` hard '' x - ray sources  with nuclear bulge  giant counterparts suggests that we are detecting true companions to many of the x - ray sources .",
    "the colour distribution of the candidate counterparts suggests the population to be predominantly nuclear bulge  giants , an older , more evolved population .",

    "they are likely to be dominated by lmxbs with evolved companions .",
    "external galaxies located close to the galactic plane are hidden from view at optical wavelengths by the high extinction .",
    "for this reason the galactic plane is referred to as the `` zone of avoidance '' or `` zoa '' in extragalactic studies .",

    "the potential for such studies is greatly improved by the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of the gps .",
    "furthermore , the star - galaxy separation is improved by the additional detection of the fainter galaxy disks .",
    "we noted in @xmath103.2 that external galaxies form a diffuse but well defined group of spatially resolved sources ( pstar@xmath45 0.9 ) at the lower right of the colour - magnitude diagrams for fields in the outer galaxy ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "inspection of the parameters in * gpssource * for the objects in the region of the plots occupied by the extragalactic group shows that nearly all of them have pstar @xmath450.9 , pgalaxy@xmath80.9 and mergedclass=+1 .",
    "a significant fraction of the individual sources are not unambiguously resolved in a casual visual inspection of the image data , but the classification in the wsa clearly benefits from the quantitative measurement of the observed spatial profile in all three passbands that is provided by the reduction pipeline . in the wsa , the nature of the profile is described by the parameter mergedclassstat , which describes the extent to which a source appear stellar , resolved , or under - sized ( eg . a cosmic ray artifact affecting only 1 pixel ) .",
    "this parameter has a normal distribution for sources in each array , with mean zero and variance unity .",
    "large values correspond to resolved sources and negative values to under - sized objects .",
    "the mergedclassstat parameter for objects in the region of the plot occupied by the extragalactic group typically has a value between 2 and 10 .",
    "we note that the classification of source image profiles as resolved or unresolved becomes unreliable near the sensitivity limits ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "these results for the relatively uncrowded fields in the outer galaxy are highly encouraging .",
    "however , the same can not be said for much more crowded fields in the direction of the inner galaxy .",
    "we noted in @xmath103.2 that sources classified as spatially resolved ( mergedclass=+1 ) are sometimes merely unresolved stellar pairs .",
    "such pairs are very common in crowded fields .",
    "to test whether it is possible to identify external galaxies in crowded fields using the source catalogues , we visually inspected a crowded field located at ( @xmath51)=(30.2,1.2 ) the area of this field is 1 wfcam tile ( 0.75 deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "visual inspection of the 48 images ( 16 wfcam arrays in 3 passbands ) yielded 38 galaxies , 15 possible galaxies and one nebulous region .",

    "the _ ( j - k ) _ vs.@xmath30 colour - magnitude diagram for this field ( not shown ) shows no clear separation between the galaxies and the sequence of reddened red clump giant stars in the field , even when the plot is restricted to sources with mergedclass=+1 .",
    "the galaxies satisfy the constraints _",
    "( j - k)_@xmath88 and m@xmath8916.5 , with a further restriction to _ ( j - k)_@xmath90 if we include only definite galaxies from the visual inspection .",

    "( j - k ) _ = 1.0 , subjected to the ( total ) extinction in this particular field .",
    "two further methods were used to attempt to separate the galaxies from stars : ( i ) the value of k_1petromag - k_1apermag3 ( i.e. a measure of resolved ( petrosian ) magnitude minus point source magnitude ) ; and ( ii ) cuts based on the parameter mergedclassstat .",
    "we found that both methods can be used to reduce the number of stars with mergedclass=+1 and similar colours and magnitudes to the galaxies .",
    "however , a cut based on either method requires us to throw away a significant fraction of the galaxies and the remaining contaminants still outnumber the the galaxies by a factor of at least 20 .    we conclude that whilst in the outer galaxy external galaxies can be easily found using the parameters in the catalogue , in crowded fields they offer no real advantage over a laborious visual search of the images .",
    "better results may be achieved in the inner galaxy at latitudes further from the mid - plane ( up to the survey limit at b=@xmath535@xmath9 ) , when these data become available .",
    "we note that the extinction through the galaxy ( as defined by the dirbe maps of schlegel et al.1998 ) and the amount of source confusion and reddening varies greatly even within the 0.75 deg@xmath0 field ( 5.1@xmath23a@xmath9121.6 ) .",
    "hence it may be possible to improve the discrimination between galaxies and red clump giant stars in future by adding a galactic extinction parameter to * gpssource * for each star ( defined in a grid with a scale of a few arcminutes ) and subtracting this from the measured extinction .",
    "= ( 31,0 ) allows us to distinguish distant early type dwarfs ( located on the lower sequence of reddened stars ) from nearby late type dwarfs ( the main clump at _ ( i-j)_=2.5 and distant red clump giants ( the upper sequence of reddened stars ) . data for unreddened stars from hewett et al.(2006 ) are plotted at the lower left as filled symbols , linked by solid lines .",
    "the approximate location of unreddened main sequence spectral types is marked .",
    "giants are redder than dwarfs in _ ( j - h ) _ at types k and m , leading to separate dwarf and giant sequences . ]",
    "a limitation of the gps data is that while the luminosity class of an individual field star can often be determined , it is not possible to estimate the spectral type in fields with significant reddening .",
    "this is because the reddening vector in the _ ( h - k ) vs.(j - h ) _ two colour diagram runs almost parallel to the main sequence of stars with spectral types o - k , introducing a degeneracy between reddening and the intrinsic colours of the photosphere .",
    "the approximate reddening for individual sources can be estimated using the _ ( h - k ) _ colour , but only by assuming the all photospheres have the same intrinsic colour .",
    "a more precise reddening value can be detemined for ysos by dereddening to the classical t tauri locus in the two colour diagram , as noted earlier , but the result is only valid for stars that are known to be ysos .",
    "we anticipate that this degeneracy can be broken for many of the brighter sources in the gps by using optical data from iphas survey ( drew et al.2005 ; sale et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",

    "work by members of the iphas team ( drew et al.2005 ) has shown that the iphas _ ( r-i ) vs. ( r-h@xmath92 ) _ two colour diagram can be used to break the degeneracy with extinction and estimate the approximate spectral type and distance of most field stars .",
    "however , this requires detection in the @xmath93 and h@xmath92 filters , which is not usually achieved in fields with high reddening .",
    "fortunately , @xmath94 fluxes will often be available for gps sources even in fields with quite high reddening , since the iphas 5@xmath18 sensitivity limit is @xmath95 ( vega system ) .    in figure 21",
    "we show an example of an iphas / gps _ ( i-j ) _ vs._(j - h ) _ two colour diagram for the field with high reddening at _ ( l , b)_=(31,0 ) that was illustrated earlier in figure 5 .",
    "the `` photoobjbest '' iphas catalogue , which contains sources that were observed in good photometric conditions and detected in all 3 iphas passbands , was used for the cross match .",
    "the scatter in the diagram has been reduced using cuts very similar to the `` most reliable , low completeness '' cuts used for the near infrared two colour diagrams ( see @xmath10a3 ) , including a restriction to sources with uncertainties @xmath230.05 mag in @xmath94 and @xmath57 .",
    "the two sequences of stars extending to the upper right of the diagram are dwarfs ( lower sequence ) and giants ( upper sequence ) .",
    "the separation between the two sequences is cleaner than in the two colour diagram in figure 5 because the separation in the _ ( i-j ) _ colour is @xmath241.25 magnitudes , which is far larger than the typical photometric uncertainties in this colour .",
    "that is not the case for the _ ( h - k ) _",
    "colour used in figure 5 , even though we restricted the selection to sources with uncertainties listed as @xmath230.05 mag on each axis .",
    "the fundamental reason for the separation remains the different intrinsic _",
    "( j - h ) _ colours of the two populations , which is due to the gravity sensitivity of the _ ( j - h ) _ colour in the giants and the earlier spectral types of the dwarfs .",
    "in addition to the improved dwarf / giant separation , a major benefit of figure 21 is the potential for spectrophotometric typing .",
    "the sources on the reddened dwarf branch are almost entirely distant early type stars ( spectral types a and f ) .",
    "this can be seen by tracing the dwarf branch back to where it would intersect with the unreddened main sequence that is overplotted ( using data from hewett et al.2006 ) .",
    "the location of the dwarf branch is consistent with either reddened a - f type stars or m dwarfs .",
    "the latter can be ruled out since they are not detected at large enough distances to incur significant reddening .",
    "this interpretation is supported by a besanon model of the field which confirms that this branch is composed of a and f type stars .",
    "( the model uses the cousins i filter rather than sloan @xmath94 so it is not exactly comparable and is therefore not shown ) .    the reddened dwarf sequence can also be traced back to the lowest part of the main clump of stars near _",

    "the clump appears elongated from lower left to upper right , and is entirely consistent with a reddened population of g and k type main sequence stars that mostly have similar extinction .",
    "this sequence is sufficiently inclined to the reddening vector to break the colour - reddening degeneracy and distinguish g - type stars from k - type stars .",
    "the extinction toward stars in the g - k clump is a@xmath36=4 - 5 magnitudes and the implied distances are typically @xmath241 - 2  kpc .",
    "the most distant red clump giants in the plot have a@xmath36@xmath449 magnitudes and implied distances of @xmath243.8  kpc .",
    "stars that are 1 - 2 magnitudes fainter in @xmath94 than those plotted , and therefore more distant , could be detected by ( i ) cross matching with the iphas `` photoobj '' catalogue rather than photoobjbest ; and ( ii ) including sources with larger photometric uncertainties .",

    "more user friendly image access is provided by the `` getimage '' , `` multigetimage '' and `` region search '' tools at the top level of the wsa , and via links from the * gpssource * catalogue entries described below .",
    "the `` getimage '' tool allows the user to find and download cut - out images in all available filters , centred on the desired galactic or equatorial coordinates .",

    "* gpssource * is the most commonly used catalogue .",
    "it is the merged catalogue containing most of the important data for all sources detected in at least one of the j , h and k passbands .",
    "the pairing scheme starts with the shortest available wavelength ( the j band if the data are available , or the h band if not ) and searches for counterparts in the h band and then the k band that are located @xmath231 arcsec from the j band detection .",
    "sources are only merged as a single entry in * gpssource * if each is the closest match to the other at all wavelengths .",
    "the epoch of observation of a star in * gpssource * in each filter can be determined by clicking on the entry in the `` getmflink '' column in the table , which will provide 1@xmath561 arcminute images centred on the star , with associated dates and times .",
    "the other main table , * gpsdetection * , contains all the information for all sources detected in any passband but with no association between detections of the same object in different filters . while * gpssource * is more convenient to use , the caveats are : ( i ) it includes only a subset of the photometric aperture sizes that are available in * gpsdetection * or the fits binary catalogues ; and ( ii ) in releases from dr3 onward , most of the extragalactic flux extimates such as petrosian magnitude are no included . the details of how to write an sql query to extract these missing attributes from the * gpsdetection * table are given in the `` sql cookbook '' at the top level of the wsa .",
    "the available columns or `` attributes '' in each table are seen when conducting a menu query ( see below ) , which optionally provides a one line description of each attribute .",
    "we recommend that the user reads the more detailed entries for the * gpssource * and * gpsdetection * parameters in the `` schema browser '' ( accessible from the wsa top level ) under `` wsa ukidss '' and then `` tables '' .",
    "the gps sql catalogues can be searched using the region search , the menu query ( recommended for new users ) or the freeform sql page , all of which are accessible from the top level of the wsa .",
    "when using these tools , users of the dr2 release and subsequent releases have an option ( in the drop down menu of tables ) to view a subset of * gpssource * which includes only areas which are complete in all three filters .",
    "this can slightly improve search speeds where the desired area is known to be complete ( e.g. from an archive listing ) .",
    "if previous data releases are being searched , the user can similarly search a dataset with full filter coverage by selecting e.g. the dr1 database , as opposed to the larger dr1plus database .    the simplest way to search the * gpssource * table is with the region search .",
    "this enables a simple search of a circular area around the desired equatorial or galactic coodinates and it returns all information in the table for every object therein .",
    "in addition , the sources listed can be clicked on to provide jpeg and fits format cut - out images around their location , in all available filters ( similar to the getimage results ) .",
    "more flexible and sophisticated queries can be made with the menu query or a freeform sql query .",
    "menu queries are constructed by clicking boxes .",
    "they return only the desired attributes and restrict their values ( e.g. magnitudes , colours , coordinates etc . ) in order to refine a search .",
    "this is especially important for the gps because a maximum of only 15 million data entries can be returned in a single query ( e.g. 1.5 million sources with 10 data attributes each ) , which can quickly be exceeded when searching more than a square degree in crowded fields .",
    "the * gpssource * attributes that are highlighted in the menu query list have their own indices in the table , which means that searches based on these parameters will proceed much more rapidly than those which do not . hence searches based on e.g. specified coordinates ( equatorial or galactic ) and a range of magnitudes will proceed rapidly if the prferred photometric aperture ( apermag3 , see below ) is used , but will take much longer if a different aperture size is used .",
    "again , this is a serious issue since the size of the gps catalogues means that searches can often time out ( the maximum duration is presently 80 minutes ) when searches are based on non - highlighted attributes . merely including non - highlighted attributes among the data to be returned ( as opposed to specifying a range of values )",
    "does not cause this problem .",
    "freeform sql queries can perform the same tasks as a menu query and also manipulate the data returned from the table or operate on two or more tables ( e.g. gps data and spitzer glimpse data ) to produce more complicated outputs .",
    "menu queries are transformed into ascii format sql queries before processing .",
    "a useful feature of the wsa is that this sql query can be viewed using the `` show and edit sql '' button during a menu query .",
    "this enables the user to learn how to perform basic freeform sql queries with no prior knowledge of the language .",
    "the sql cookbook provides further training .    a list of fits binary source catalogues associated with individual coadded multiframe images ( _ leavstacks _ ) is provided along with the image lists described in @xmath10a1.3 in an archive listing .",
    "they may be viewed with freely available software such as fv ( fitsviewer ) .",
    "these catalogues contain only single filter data and source fluxes within the various apertures are given in data numbers ( normalised to the exposure time of individual frames on sky ) rather than magnitudes .",
    "the catalogue headers include the aperture corrections , photometric zero points , airmass and the exposure times ( for the individual frames on sky ) , so it is straightforward to calculate magnitudes or to conduct additional photometry , e.g. on very faint sources which may have been missed by the source detection algorithm and are therefore not in the source catalogues .",
    "we note that the fits binary catalogues have less precise r.a . and dec coordinates than the sql source catalogues , owing to a limitation on the number of data bits which corresponds to a precision of @xmath240.36 arcsec .",
    "however , the exact coordinates can be recovered using the precise x , y array coordinates given for each source and the wcs information in the catalogue fits headers .",
    "details of the columns in the fits binary catalogues ( which provide additional information relevant to the sql source catalogues ) are available from the casu website ( irwin et al.2005 ) and in irwin et al.(2008 ) .",
    "the wfcam pipeline performs aperture photometry , as opposed to profile fitting photometry . however , any overlapping apertures are simultaneously fitted and the fluxes in areas of overlap are assigned to each target in proportion to the total flux within each aperture .",
    "this generally produces good photometry even in the crowded gps fields ( see a3 ) , though there will be cases where the photometry is imperfect , such as faint sources on the wings of a bright or saturated star .",
    "we note that profile fitting photometry may be included in the final processing of all ukidss data when the survey is finished , but tests with an algorithm designed for the irregular image profiles often generated by ground based microstepped data have shown no significant gain in precision .",
    "photometry is output for a series of circular apertures , for which consecutive aperture numbers have a ratio of @xmath103 in diameter .",
    "the smallest aperture , apermag1 , has a diameter of 1 arcsec .",
    "the default aperture that is used for gps point source colours in * gpssource * is apermag3 , which has a diameter of 2 arcsec .",
    "only apermag3 , apermag4 and apermag6 and the much larger hallmag aperture ( which is a measure of the total flux from each source ) are available in * gpssource * in the existing data releases ( though all apertures are available in * gpsdetection * ) .",
    "we recommend that apermag3 is used for most gps science unless there is good reason to desire a smaller or larger aperture . for future ukidss releases",
    "it is planned to change the available apertures in * gpssource * to apermag1 , apermag3 and apermag4 , with the rationale that the smaller aperture yields more reliable photometry in the most crowded fields and the slightly larger aperture will sometimes yield more precise photometry in the off - plane tap region , where relatively poor seeing is accepted .        * in many images the profiles of stars in the _ leav _ and _ leavstack _ images may appear to be slightly `` speckled '' with departures from the smooth monotonic image profiles usually seen in astronomical data .",
    "this is due to the changes in the natural seeing during the microstepping procedure referred to in a1.2 , which can cause adjacent rows and columns to show significant differences in flux .",
    "comparison of fields with and without this effect have shown that it has no significant effect on photometric precision .",
    "* electronic cross talk between adjacent array read out channels causes the appearance of spurious sources located at multiples of 128 pixels ( 51.2 arcsec ) away from all bright stars along the axis of array readout ( which is oriented differently for each quadrant of an array ) .",
    "this is a general feature of hawaii 2 arrays that is most serious for pixels which are close to saturation ( @xmath104 dn ) in the wsa images .",
    "note that the separation @xmath105n pixels becomes @xmath106n pixels in the coadded and interleaved _ leavstack _ images .",
    "all data in the dr2 release benefit from a cross - talk removal procedure which has reduced the problem .",
    "hovewer , the procedure is imperfect so some artifacts remain .",
    "this is particularly so in regions with spatially variable background , where a flaw in the procedure actually generated additional cross talk artifacts that do not always lie @xmath105n pixels from a bright star .",
    "owing to this error some images of regions with large gradients in the background were removed from dr2 , including several h band images near the galactic centre .",
    "the error will be fixed from dr3 onward and the lost images will be recovered .",
    "the archive also addresses the cross talk problem from the dr2 release onward , but in the catalogues rather than the images .",
    "possible cross talk artifacts are flagged in the data given in the pperrbits columns in * gpssource * and * gpsdetection*. this identifies almost all cross talk artifacts at @xmath105n pixels from a bright star by using the 2mass point source catalogue .",
    "usage of the pperrbits flags to remove suspect data is described in a3 .",
    "+ the brighter artifacts can be seen to be spurious since they have positive counts on one side of the profile and negative counts on the other ( relative to the sky level ) .",
    "this is because the cross talk artifacts are related to the spatial derivative of the profile of the bright star that generated them , in the readout direction .",
    "fainter stars can sometimes produce artifacts which look more like real stars ( and generally have similar colours ) .",
    "it is advisable to guard against this by checking the images for bright stars near objects of interest .",
    "over - saturated stars produce larger , obviously non - stellar artifacts with a ring - like structure . *",
    "saturated stars have @xmath107 counts in _ leavstack _ images , but the centre of an oversaturated star has a lower count level ( often below the sky background ) .",
    "this is a general feature of data taken with near infrared arrays in the correlated double sampling mode ( cds ) .",
    "saturated stars exist in most gps fields .",
    "they are usually included in the source catalogues but the fluxes given are not meaningful .",
    "again , the pperrbits column in the catalogues can be used to efficiently remove these bad data , in this case by requiring e.g. jpperrbits@xmath2365536 to ensure that a source is not saturated at j band .",
    "conservatively , it is safer to use 2mass at m@xmath41@xmath2312.0 , m@xmath80@xmath2312.75 , m@xmath81@xmath2313.25 , though the typical saturation limits are @xmath240.5 magnitudes brighter than this .",
    "the pperrbits parameters can be used to find the precise limits for each field in each filter , using the threshold value quoted above .",
    "heavily oversaturated stars cause multiple spurious detections in each filter ( and in * gpssource * ) , since the saturated region is larger than the size of the stellar image profile used by the pipeline source detection algorithm . these are often listed in the archive as resolved sources rather than stars ( i.e. mergedclass=+1 ) .",
    "* photometric errors are generally under - estimated .",
    "the photometric errors given in magnitudes and colours are only notional internal errors ( excluding calibration uncertainty ) that are based on source counts in the apertures , the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the image and the standard deviation of the background flux .",
    "a plot of errors vs. magnitude yields a single smooth curve for fields contained within a single wfcam array .",
    "the wsa is similar to the 2mass point source catalogue in this respect .",
    "the given error systematically underestimates the true error by a factor of @xmath241.2 , owing to the inter - pixel capacitance of the wfcam arrays .",
    "this phenomenon reduces the noise estimate derived from a measure of the local standard deviation by this factor by causing inter - pixel correlation of the count values ( irwin et al.2008 ) .",
    "hence sources with photometric uncertainties of 0.20 magnitudes in the archive are in fact usually closer to 4@xmath18 detections than 5@xmath18 detections .",
    "additionally , errors specific to individual sources are not included in the error budget : e.g. bad pixels , the presence of adjacent stars or cross talk artifacts , or small scale spatial variations in sky background .",
    "finally , the casu pipeline is designed to deliver an absolute photometric precision of @xmath240.02 mag for sources with a high signal to noise ratio .",
    "( the uncertainty in the photometric calibration is discussed below ) .",
    "therefore users should not take seriously the millimagnitude uncertainties that are quoted for bright stars .",
    "when studying a particular source users should inspect the image data ( and perhaps also the _ confidence images _ ) to be sure that the given error is meaningful .",
    "* nebulosity can also lead to photometric errors , since the sky background is evaluated with a relatively coarse grid in each field ( typically in 25 arcsec grid cells ) .",
    "a more sophisticated method of measuring the background on smaller spatial scales in nebulous regions has been developed by m.irwin in order to improve the photometry but it will not be implemented in the wsa until dr5 . more seriously , the source detection algorithm fails in regions of very bright nebulosity , since the nebula is interpreted as a single extended source . at present",
    "this effect has been seen only in parts of the m17 star formation region ( see @xmath104.2 ) which is one of the largest regions of bright nebulosity in the sky . in such regions , it is necessary at present for users to do their own photometry ( see @xmath108 )      @xmath109 + @xmath110 + @xmath111 + the @xmath112 colour excesses are computed using the prescription of bonifacio et al.(2000 ) , from the data of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . since the extinction terms are small ( @xmath112=3 corresponds to 9 magnitudes of visual extinction for a typical interstellar reddening law ) , differential extinction across each detector is usually insufficient to contribute significantly to the uncertainty in the zero points , as measured by the internal scatter amongst the bright 2mass sources that are used .",
    "( the uncertainties in the zero points are included in the image headers and the fits binary catalogue headers .",
    ") however , a small number of fields exist where spatially variable extinction causes significantly increased uncertainty in the calculated zero points .",
    "this should be borne in mind if the data are used to investigate e.g. possible spatial variations in the near infrared extinction law in star formation regions .                  here",
    "we present three different choices of catalogue parameters that are likely to be useful to generate different types of source list , ranging from a complete but unreliable selection of the stellar sources in a region to a highly reliable but seriously incomplete selection .",
    "a fourth option is to use * reliablegpspointsource * in a freeform sql query instead of * gpssource*. this `` view '' of the source table is simpler than the methods described below but less effective .",
    "details of its contents are available under `` schema browser '' at the wsa .    generating a complete list of unique galactic sources is a little more complicated than simply returning all sources in a region of the sky .",
    "this is for two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) * gpssource * contains sources classified as `` noise '' , via the attribute `` mergedclass = 0 '' , in addition to the more numerous real sources which are variously classified as stars ( mergedclass = @xmath113 ) , probable stars ( mergedclass = @xmath114 ) , galaxies ( mergedclass=@xmath115 ) and probable galaxies ( mergedclass = @xmath116 ) , on the basis of the image profile . the ukidss philosophy is to include in the archive all data that might be useful .",
    "however , we recommend that sources classified as noise be excluded from gps searches , since most of them are not real sources , and they would inflate the star counts in any given field by @xmath2410% . in general",
    "this will lead to a more accurate star count in any given field than a search on all types of source , at the price of excluding only a very small number of real sources .",
    "by contrast , it is necessary to include `` galaxies '' and `` probable galaxies '' in a complete search , since many of these ( in fact most of them in crowded fields ) are marginally resolved pairs of stars which have been mis - classified in * gpssource*. ( 2 ) sources located in the regions of overlap between different arrays in a wfcam tile are duplicated in the wsa .",
    "these duplicates can be identified and removed using the _ priorsec _ attribute , which describes primary or secondary detections ( see hambly et al.2008 ) .",
    "this consideration also affects @xmath2410% of sources .    an illustrative sql query to return a selection of useful attributes for the complete list of real unique sources located near @xmath117",

    "the two colour diagram for the complete search at these coordinates is shown in figure a1(a ) .",
    "it is frequently desirable to restrict the sample to sources with small photometric errors , in order to identify the main stellar populations more easily in two colour and colour magnitude diagrams .",
    "a restricted search can be done entirely with the wsa but since the user will often wish to vary the search parameters while investigating the data it is often preferable to download the results of a complete search and then alter the parameters interactively .",
    "this can be done by loading the data into a suitable software package .",
    "we strongly recommend topcat , a user friendly software package designed to manipulate and display data tables written in a variety of virtual observatory and text formats ..",

    "( we note that column numbers can be used in topcat instead of parameter names for brevity ) .",
    "the majority of the sources are located in a band running from the lower left to the upper right , caused by the reddening of the main sequence and giant star populations . however , a large number of photometric outliers are apparent and some sources lie outside the boundaries of the plot .",

    "<S> the ukidss galactic plane survey ( gps ) is one of the five near infrared public legacy surveys that are being undertaken by the ukidss consortium , using the wide field camera on the united kingdom infrared telescope . </S>",
    "<S> it is surveying 1868  deg@xmath0 of the northern and equatorial galactic plane at galactic latitudes @xmath1 in the j , h and k filters and a @xmath2  deg@xmath0 area of the taurus - auriga - perseus molecular cloud complex in these three filters and the 2.12  @xmath3 m ( 1 - 0 ) h@xmath4 filter . </S>",
    "<S> it will provide data on @xmath5 sources . here </S>",
    "<S> we describe the properties of the dataset and provide a user s guide for its exploitation . </S>",
    "<S> we also present brief demonstration science results from dr2 and from the science verification programme . </S>",
    "<S> these results illustrate how gps data will frequently be combined with data taken in other wavebands to produce scientific results . </S>",
    "<S> the demonstration science comprises six studies . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) a gps-_spitzer_-glimpse cross match for the star formation region g28.983 - 0.603 to identify ysos . </S>",
    "<S> this increases the number of ysos identified by a factor of ten compared to glimpse alone . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) a wide field study of the m17 nebula , in which an extinction map of the field is presented and the effect of source confusion on luminosity functions in different sub - regions is noted . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) h@xmath4 emission in the @xmath6 ophiuchi dark cloud . </S>",
    "<S> all the molecular jets are traced back to a single active clump containing only a few protostars , which suggests that the duration of strong jet activity and associated rapid accretion in low mass protostars is brief . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) x - ray sources in the nuclear bulge . </S>",
    "<S> the gps data distinguishes local main sequence counterparts with soft x - ray spectra from nuclear bulge giant counterparts with hard x - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) external galaxies in the zone of avoidance . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies are clearly distinguished from stars in fields at longitudes @xmath7@xmath890@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) iphas - gps optical - infrared spectrophotometric typing . </S>",
    "<S> the _ ( i-j ) vs.(j - h ) _ diagram is used to distinguish a - f type dwarfs , g dwarfs , k dwarfs and red clump giants in a field with high reddening .
