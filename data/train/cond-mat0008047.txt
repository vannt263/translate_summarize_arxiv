    "nanocrystals exist in a size regime which lies between that of atomic and bulk matter , thus making them ideal for the study of extreme quantum effects in condensed matter systems .",
    "in particular , the vibrational properties of nanoparticles are strikingly different than their bulk counterparts : a spherical nanoparticle of diameter @xmath4 can not support internal vibrations at frequencies less than about @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a characteristic bulk sound velocity .",
    "any property of the nanoparticle that depends on the vibrational spectrum , such as its thermodynamic properties or electron - phonon dynamics , will be very different at low energies than in bulk crystals",
    ". this will be especially true for nanoparticles  for example , in powder form  only weakly coupled to their surroundings .",
    "one way to probe the vibrational spectrum of a nanoparticle is to optically excite an electron - hole pair and study the intraband electronic energy relaxation prior to radiative recombination @xcite .",
    "however , the excitonic states , being only weakly localized , will suffer significant quantum - confinement effects in the nanoparticle , making comparison with bulk relaxation rather indirect .",
    "an alternative probe of the vibrational spectrum is provided by well - localized electronic impurity states in a doped nanocrystal @xcite .",
    "the impurity states can be used to probe both energy relaxation by phonon emission @xcite and phonon - induced dephasing @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the difference between the nanocrystal and bulk behavior is almost entirely a consequence of their differing vibrational modes .    in a recent experiment , yang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the phonon emission rate in eu - doped y@xmath1o@xmath2 nanoparticles between two electronic states separated by 3  @xmath7 in energy .",
    "the experiment was performed on a powder of nanoparticles , prepared by gas - phase condensation , with a mean diameter of 13  nm .",
    "regarding the nanoparticles as isotropic elastic spheres @xcite , the lowest internal vibrational mode ( a five - fold degenerate torsional mode ) has a frequency of about 11  @xmath7 .",
    "the excited - state population was found to decay exponentially with a lifetime of 27  @xmath8s , more than two orders of magnitude longer than that between the same levels in the bulk ( about 220  ns ) .",
    "although there is no quantitative theory available yet to explain their results , the inhibited phonon emission is consistent with a large suppression of the low - frequency vibrational density - of - states ( dos ) expected for these small crystals .",
    "experiments such as the one by yang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite present an exciting opportunity to study the crossover of phonon dynamics from bulk to nanoscale systems .",
    "however , the following question immediately arises : given the large apparent modification of the dos by finite - size effects , is it still correct to expect exponential relaxation and to use perturbation theory ( fermi s golden rule and so on ) to relate the relaxation rate to the phonon dos ?",
    "after all , the energy in a nanoparticle that is completely isolated from its surroundings would have to be exchanged between the electron and vibrational degrees of freedom in a rabi - like manner , and no relaxation would be observed .",
    "indeed , an isolated nanoparticle may be regarded as a phonon analog of a two - level atom in a cavity , which is known to exhibit oscillatory population dynamics @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to detect oscillatory population dynamics experimentally using the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite , but what would be the effect of the unavoidable _ distribution _ of nanoparticle sizes and corresponding vibrational - mode frequencies ? in the limit where each nanoparticle has a two - level system interacting with only the lowest - frequency vibrational mode , called the lamb mode , each nanoparticle would exhibit vacuum rabi oscillations @xcite",
    ". however , the rabi frequency , which is a function of the electron - phonon interaction strength and the energy mismatch between the two - level system and lamb mode , would vary from nanoparticle to nanoparticle .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the electron - phonon dynamics of an ensemble of nearly isolated nanoparticles .",
    "we find that at short times the ensemble - averaged excited - state population oscillates in a fashion that depends on the detailed size distribution of the nanoparticles , but that at long times the oscillations become purely sinusoidal about a `` plateau '' population fraction , with the frequency of the oscillation determined by the electron - phonon interaction strength alone , and with an envelope that decays algebraically as @xmath0 . in the infinite - time limit",
    ", the excited - state population approaches the constant , finite plateau value .",
    "( of course , the small damping of the lamb mode , produced by the weak but nonzero interaction of a nanoparticle with its environment , will eventually cause the electrons to relax irreversibly . )    in the next section we derive a general expression for the average excited - state population in an ensemble of nanoparticles at zero temperature , and study its short - time and long - time behavior . the rotating - wave - approximation ( rwa ) we use there limits the application of our results to situations where the detuning energies ( the energy mismatch between the two - level system and lamb mode ) are not much larger than the electron - phonon interaction strength . in section 3",
    "we apply this theory to an ensemble of y@xmath1o@xmath2:eu@xmath3 nanoparticles similar to that of yang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and give quantitative predictions for the average excited - state population as a function of the mean nanoparticle size and standard deviation .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions and a discussion of questions for future investigation .",
    "to begin , we consider a single doped nanoparticle . we assume this nanoparticle to be an isotropic elastic sphere with a single localized electronic two - level system embedded within .",
    "we limit our investigation to small detuning energies , thus allowing for the use of the rwa , which discards non - energy - conserving terms in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will neglect the five - fold degeneracy of the lowest vibrational mode that would be present in a perfectly spherical nanoparticle @xcite , and will assume a single nondegenerate lamb mode .",
    "we shall return to this point below in section 4 .",
    "`` dissipation terms '' in the hamiltonian are neglected as well . by dissipation terms we mean interactions of the nanoparticle with its surroundings that allow vibrational energy to be carried away irreversibly . for weak dissipation",
    ", these terms would cause an exponential decay of the population at large times , causing the `` plateau '' population to fall exponentially to zero .",
    "this effect would be negligible at small times and therefore would have no impact on the short - time calculations given below . for large dissipation",
    ", the exponential decay would be noticeable at all times and would therefore render our results invalid .",
    "we assume that there is only one vibrational mode available for the electronic system to couple to  the next vibrational mode being so high in energy as to make the effect of its coupling negligible . therefore ,",
    "as stated , our doped nanoparticle system consists of a two - level atom coupled to single vibrational mode .",
    "the hamiltonian , in units where @xmath9 , is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 .",
    "the first term in @xmath12 is the hamiltonian for a noninteracting two - level system with energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and fermionic creation and annihilation operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the second term is the hamiltonian for a vibrational mode with frequency @xmath17 and phonon creation and annihilation operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the third term is the ordinary first - order interaction between the two - level system and the vibrational mode .",
    "@xmath20 is the electron - phonon interaction energy , with @xmath21 , and the other terms equal to zero .",
    "the wave function can be written as a superposition of the two electronic states , together with all possible populations of the single vibrational mode ,    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    the coefficients @xmath24 satisfy the coupled equations ,    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the electronic energy - level separation .    in the rwa , which is valid near resonance ( defined by the condition @xmath28 )",
    ", these coupled differential equations reduce to    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    is the detuning frequency .",

    "the probability that the electron is in state @xmath35 , irrespective of the number of phonons present , is    @xmath36    then @xmath37 is given by    @xmath38    and    @xmath39    the dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath41 on @xmath42 will be suppressed for simplicity .    in an ensemble of such nanoparticles ,",
    "a variation in diameter yields a similar variation in detuning frequency , @xmath42 .",
    "we assume this to be a gaussian distribution . to obtain values for the mean detuning @xmath43 , and standard deviation in detuning @xmath44",
    ", we assume each nanoparticle to be an isotropic elastic continuum with stress - free boundary conditions .",
    "then , as shown by lamb @xcite , the lowest vibrational frequency is    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the bulk transverse sound velocity and @xmath4 is the nanoparticle diameter .",
    "the mean detuning is then    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the mean particle diameter .",
    "using these relationships , we assume a distribution in detuning frequency given by @xmath49  the ensemble - averaged population of electronic state @xmath50 is then given by    @xmath51    the behavior of @xmath52 at short times is sinusoidal with a decaying envelope dependent on the specifics of the particle size distribution",
    ". we will give examples of the short - time dynamics below .",
    "the long - time behavior of @xmath52 can be obtained analytically by an asymptotic expansion .",
    "we begin by writing ( [ average population ] ) as    @xmath53    where    @xmath54    is a constant independent of time , and    @xmath55    where    @xmath56    is the _ resonant _ rabi frequency .",
    "it will turn out that the constant @xmath57 is simply the value of @xmath52 in the @xmath58 limit .",
    "values of this plateau population are given in table 1 .    .",
    "plateau population values for @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is the resonant rabi frequency .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the integral @xmath62 can be evaluated at large times by analytically continuing @xmath42 into the complex plane and expanding around the saddle - point at @xmath63 .",

    "this occurs because the higher - frequency components tend to average out faster .",
    "however , the amplitude of the asymptotic oscillations decreases with @xmath43 .    to illustrate the short - time behavior of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath44 , we present several plots showing @xmath66 as a function of @xmath68 . in choosing values for @xmath67 and @xmath44",

    "here we use the results of section 2 to address possible future experiments .",
    "we examine the case of y@xmath1o@xmath2:eu@xmath3 nanoparticles , specifically the electron dynamics between two crystal - field split @xmath76d@xmath77 levels separated by @xmath78  @xmath7 , such as in the experiment by yang _",

    "@xcite . to make quantitative predictions for such nanoparticles , the only parameters that need to be specified are the mean detuning frequency @xmath67 , and the standard deviation in detuning @xmath44 .",

    "furthermore , these values are too far off resonance to be reliably addressed by the rwa .    to observe the behavior predicted in section 2 for y@xmath1o@xmath2:eu@xmath3 nanoparticles , the mean diameter should be about 46  nm , and standard deviation in diameter no more than about 3  nm [ see eqns .",

    "we have shown that the unavoidable size - dispersion in a collection of nanoparticles can effect the ensemble - averaged electronic population dynamics considerably , affecting even the oscillation frequency at long times .",
    "however , our analysis has been restricted to near - resonant conditions in an idealized single - mode nanocrystal .",
    "a comprehensive theory of electron - phonon dynamics in nearly isolated nanoparticles will have to address a number of additional issues .",
    "first , the vibrational modes of a nanoparticle will be broadened due to intrinsic mechanisms and from interaction to the environment .",
    "for example , anharmonicity will broaden the lamb mode at finite temperature @xcite , as will mechanical coupling to a substrate or to a cluster of other nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "this broadening will cause the envelope of the population oscillations to decay exponentially at long times . for weak",
    "damping , however , we do not expect any qualitative changes in the short - time dynamics .",
    "second , nanoparticles will generally have large detuning frequencies , making the inclusion of higher - frequency modes necessary , and making the rwa invalid .",
    "one way to include these effects would be to do exact - diagonalization studies in models with a truncated hilbert space ; for example , having bounded phonon occupation numbers for one or more modes .",
    "finally , it will be necessary to understand the effects of vibrational - mode degeneracy , which has been neglected here .",
    "the presence of degeneracy means that the lamb mode has a vector - like internal degree of freedom , the components of the vector describing the phonon amplitude in each branch .",
    "although there has been work done in the quantum optics literature on the multi - mode generalizations of the our hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , that work has focused on the two - photon resonance case where @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "one way to approach the degenerate case nonperturbatively would be to assume @xmath106 degenerate modes in the limit of large @xmath106 . by analogy with other quantum systems with internal degrees of freedom ,",
    "like particles with @xmath106 spin components , it is reasonable to expect that quantum effects will be diminished in the large @xmath106 limit . in a nanoparticle",
    "this would suggest a suppression of the rabi oscillations .",
    "this work was supported by a research innovation award from the research corporation .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank bill dennis , richard meltzer , and kelly patton for useful discussions ."
