    "the strength of crystalline materials is mainly determined by the motion of dislocations , the carriers of plastic flow . at high temperatures",
    "the mechanical properties of metals and alloys can change fundamentally because of dislocation climb .",
    "climb occurs when the motion of the dislocations has a component perpendicular to their glide plane .",
    "this requires the emission or absorption of point defects and their long - range diffusion . due to the ability to annihilate edge dislocation dipoles",
    ", climb plays a fundamental role , for instance , in high temperature creep @xcite and recovery @xcite .",
    "climb mobility has also an important effect on dislocation morphology @xcite .",
    "specifically , climb and cross - slip control the length scale of the cells of the dislocation network @xcite , and the suppression of climb leads to the freezing of the network into a diffuse - looking random distribution @xcite .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to incorporate these mechanisms in dislocation dynamics ( dd ) simulations which constitute the most suitable tool to study the evolution of a whole dislocation population , and thus to model the plastic flow at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "dislocation climb was introduced in several two- @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xcite dd simulations .",
    "these models generally treat dislocation climb as a glide motion , _ i.e._a conservative motion , with a smaller mobility .",
    "this is not sufficient to capture all the involved physics .",
    "when the point defect concentration in the bulk is different from its equilibrium value ( e.g. under irradiation or after a quench of the crystal ) , dislocations can climb without the existence of a mechanical force .",
    "point defect super- or under - saturation gives birth , in this case , to an additional force , the osmotic force .",
    "this is not described in simulations where climb is treated like glide , and only dd models based on the diffusion theory of point defects @xcite lead then to a proper description of dislocation climb .",
    "we introduce in the present article a diffusion based climb model in 3d dd simulations using a nodal representation of dislocations @xcite .",
    "the climb model is similar to the one previously used by mordehai _",
    "et al_.@xcite in 3d dd simulations where dislocations were discretized in edge and screw segments .",
    "these dd simulations are used to study the coarsening kinetics of prismatic dislocation loops .",
    "prismatic dislocation loops , whose burgers vector has a component normal to their habit plane , may be obtained in both thermal quenching @xcite and irradiation experiments @xcite .",
    "they result from the condensation of point - defects , vacancies or interstitials , into discs which collapse to form a dislocation loop .",
    "these loops contribute in irradiated metals to the material embrittlement by radiation damage . in semiconductors , loops formed during the annealing stage which follows",
    "ion implantation may affect electronic properties of the device @xcite .",
    "knowing the long term time evolution of the loop population is therefore essential .",
    "it has been observed experimentally @xcite that loops coarsen : large loops grow at the expense of the smaller ones .",
    "their size thus increases on average , whereas their density decreases .",
    "different mechanisms for loop coarsening have been proposed and modeled .",
    "large loops may grow by the absorption of vacancies emitted by the shrinking loops , the exchange being carried out through vacancy bulk diffusion @xcite .",
    "pipe diffusion of point defects along the dislocation lines may also lead to a transfer of matter around the loops .",
    "this generates a translation of the loop in its habit plane , a process known as self climb or conservative climb @xcite .",
    "coarsening can then occur by direct coalescence of the loops @xcite .",
    "finally , if loops are unfaulted , they can glide along their prismatic cylinder , thus also allowing for coalescence @xcite .",
    "depending of the material , the type of the loops ( vacancy or interstitial , faulted or unfaulted ) , and the annealing temperature , loop coarsening occurs by one or several of the mechanisms described above . in the present article",
    ", we do not consider pipe diffusion , which will be devoted to future work , and we study loop coarsening controlled by bulk diffusion .",
    "this coarsening regime has been reported in several experiments @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe our climb model and its introduction in 3d dd simulation",
    ". then simulations of loop coarsening are performed , where prismatic glide of the loop is forbidden .",
    "this allows a comparison with the coarsening model first proposed by kirchner @xcite , and revisited by burton and speight @xcite .",
    "finally , the contribution of prismatic glide to the kinetics is presented .",
    "the paper ends with concluding remarks .",
    "the climb model used in our dd simulations is based on the diffusion theory of point defects .",
    "as our dd simulations are used to study the annealing kinetics of post - irradiated or quenched materials , only vacancies are contributing to dislocation climb .",
    "interstitials play a role only under irradiation . jogs and pipe - diffusion are not considered in our model .",
    "this means that dislocations are assumed to be perfect sinks for vacancies which are thus at equilibrium all along the dislocation lines and not only on localized points corresponding to the jogs .",
    "these are the same assumptions as in the work of mordehai _",
    "et al_.@xcite , where it has been shown that such an idealized model leads nevertheless to a reasonable description of dislocation climb and is justified for high temperatures like the one of the present work ( 600k in al ) .",
    "in contrast with this earlier work , our dd simulations are based on a nodal representation of the dislocation line and not on a discretization in edge and screw segments .",
    "we therefore avoid discretization problems , but we need to define a climb velocity for all the dislocation characters , and not only for the edge ones .      the starting point to derive the dislocation climb rate is the diffusion equation for the vacancy concentration @xmath0 in the steady - state limit . neglecting the elastic interaction between vacancies and dislocations ,",
    "this reduces to the laplace equation , @xmath1 in order to obtain simple analytical expressions , we derive the solution of this equation for an isolated infinite straight dislocation .",
    "we therefore do not consider the interaction between the diffusion fields of the individual dislocation segments .",
    "a cylindrical control volume with inner radius @xmath2 of order of the core radius is defined around the dislocation segment whose climb rate we want to calculate .",

    "it will therefore only lead to a correction on the time scale .",
    "such an elastic interaction is important to consider when two different point defects , like vacancies and interstitials , are diffusing as it can lead to some bias on their relative absorption by dislocations @xcite . in our simulations ,",

    "climbing dislocations emit or absorb a number of vacancies proportional to the area they sweep .",

    "the dislocation glide plane is then fixed by this line vector @xmath10 and the burgers vector @xmath11 .",
    "the mobility of the jogged dislocation should be smaller than the one of the perfect dislocation as revealed by atomic simulations @xcite . nevertheless , this is negligible compared to the mobility difference between glide and climb .",

    "this is different from the picture of a jogged dislocation in dd simulations where dislocations are discretized in edge and screw segments @xcite : in such simulations , all segments belong to a definite @xmath119 glide system , but the jogs have to be concentrated in a single point instead of being spread all along the dislocation line , thus creating a superjog in the simulation .",
    "+    when the glide mobility is non - zero , prismatic loops can glide on the surface of a cylinder , whose axis is parallel to the burgers vector of the loops . due to the elastic interactions between them , loops move on this prismatic cylinders .",
    "the first consequence is that they can deviate now from their pure edge orientation .",
    "most importantly , if the cylinders of two different loops intersect , the loops can come into contact with each other",
    ". loops can thus merge by gliding on their prismatic cylinder , a process much faster than coarsening by bulk diffusion .",

    "during all this coalescence stage , glide allows the loops to keep their equilibrium shape . at the end ( figure [ gc1]f ) , only the largest loop survives .",
    "the coarsening thus results from climb assisted by glide .",
    "one should also note that , in this case , the loops are so close that the mechanical climb force does not only arises from the loop line tension but also from the stress exerted from one loop to the other one .",

    "the area of the loops was calculated by projecting the loops on planes perpendicular to the burgers vector of the loops .",
    "it gives thus a measure of the number of vacancies condensed in the loops .",
    "glide makes the loop population rapidly evolve at the beginning of the simulation . in set 1 , which contains large loops close to each other ,",
    "loops come in contact by glide and form a complicated network ( figure [ coalescence ] ) which then evolves by climb assisted by glide .",
    "in contrast , in set 3 , which is a collection of small loops separated by larger distances compared to their radius , few loops coalesce by glide at the beginning .",
    "the coarsening mainly proceed by climb , with glide leading to some isolated coalescence events and thus enhancing the kinetics .",
    "the time evolution of the vacancy supersaturation and of the loop densities is presented in figure [ fig_q_of_int_gc ] .",
    "the vacancy supersaturation initially increases for short time so as to reach equilibrium with the given loop population .",
    "this is similar to what was observed in the previous section without glide .",
    "then the supersaturation decays as the loops absorb the excess of vacancies during the coarsening , whereas the loop density decreases and their size increases .",
    "time evolution of the vacancy supersaturation , loop density , and mean projected loop area in the simulations with finite glide drag coefficient , compared to the simulations with infinite glide drag coefficient , for the data set 1 ( on the left ) and data set 3 ( right column).,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    to highlight the effect of glide on the coarsening of the prismatic loops , the simulations were repeated on the data sets 1 and 3 , with a glide mobility set to zero . as it can be seen from figure [ gc_and_c ] , the simulations with glide and climb result in faster coarsening than simulations with climb only .",
    "of course , when loops are allowed to glide , the coarsening model of kirchner @xcite and burton and speight @xcite does not apply anymore .",
    "this is quite normal as this model assumes that loops can only climb thanks to vacancy bulk diffusion and , as soon as loop glide is allowed , it dramatically changes the coarsening kinetics .",
    "the introduction in dd simulations of a dislocation climb model based on vacancy bulk diffusion allows us to study the coarsening kinetics of prismatic loops .",
    "when loops can not glide , because they are faulted for instance , we obtain a perfect agreement between our simulations and the coarsening model of kirchner @xcite and burton and speight @xcite .",
    "the average size of the loops increases with time @xmath121 like @xmath80 , the loop density decreases like @xmath122 , and the vacancy supersaturation decreases like @xmath87 .    when the loops can also glide on their prismatic cylinders , a much faster coarsening kinetics is obtained .",
    "prismatic glide leads to direct coalescence of the loops .",
    "these coalescence events enhance the coarsening of the loop distribution . for high loop densities ,",
    "where the distance between loops is small compared to their size , glide leads to a complex dislocation microstructure and coarsening mainly proceeds by aggregation .",
    "only vacancy bulk diffusion has been taken into account in our simulations .",
    "it has been proposed in the literature @xcite that vacancy pipe - diffusion also leads to coalescence of the loops , as a result of a motion of the loops in the plane perpendicular to their prismatic cylinder .",
    "the next step of this work will therefore be to include climb associated with vacancy pipe diffusion so as to simulate all coarsening regimes .",
    "the effects of jogs on climb @xcite should also be considered so as to improve the climb mobility law .",
    "this work was supported by the european fusion materials modeling program ( efda mat - remev ) .",
    "the simulations were performed with the 3d dd code numodis ( cea - cnrs , france ) .",
    "the authors are grateful to the other developers of the code , m. fivel , e. ferrie , and v. quatella .",
    "of an isolated loop with initial radius @xmath123 nm when @xmath124.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the coarsening model of kirchner @xcite and of burton and speight @xcite makes use of the growing law of a prismatic loop .",
    "such a law is based on the line tension approximation and on the solution of fick s equation for vacancies diffusing from the bulk to the loop .",
    "several solutions can be found in the literature depending of the assumed geometry for the flux fields and of the boundary conditions for the vacancy concentration .",
    "these solutions differ only in the value of the geometrical factor @xmath83 which appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphabs ] ) in the modeling of coarsening kinetics of prismatic loops .",
    "seidman and balluffi @xcite assuming toroidal boundary conditions for the flux field around the prismatic loop obtained @xmath125 , where @xmath2 is the circular cross - section of the torus and @xmath88 is its radius . if the loop is treated as a disc @xcite , the value is @xmath126 .",
    "burton and speight obtained @xmath127 by assuming spherical symmetry for the vacancy flux field around a loop considered to be a punctual source / sink .    following the approach of mordehai _",
    "et al_.@xcite , we use our dd simulations in combination with a line tension model to evaluate the value of @xmath83 .",
    "we therefore simulate the loop shrinkage of an isolated loop under equilibrium vacancy concentration @xmath128 , and we maintain fixed this vacancy concentration in the bulk .",
    "one observes that a vacancy loop annihilates .",
    "according to the line tension model @xcite its surface @xmath48 is decreasing like @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the initial surface of the loop and the annihilation time @xmath131 is given by @xmath132    the shrinkage of an isolated loop with initial radius @xmath123 nm is presented in figure [ ravts ] : the linear variation with time of the surface of the loop is clearly obtained . using eq .",
