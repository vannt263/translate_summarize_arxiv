    "in highly anisotropic layered superconductors , tilting a magnetic field at a direction oblique to the cuo@xmath1 planes leads to novel states of vortex matter .",
    "bitter decoration@xcite , hall probe microscopy and lorentz microscopy have confirmed that the attraction between josephson vortex ( jv ) stacks and pancake vortices ( pv ) in the vortex solid state of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 leads to the so - called crossing - lattice@xcite .",
    "this state is only one of many constituting a particularly rich phase diagram .",
    "the occurence of other structural phases of vortex matter , _",
    "e.g. _ , the lattice of tilted pv stacks , the combined perpendicular and tilted pv stacks@xcite , or the pv - soliton lattice , depends on the interplay between the magnetic and josephson coupling contributions to the pv lattice tilt modulus @xcite .",
    "the josephson plasma resonance ( jpr ) frequency @xmath4 is sensitive to the superconducting phase difference , @xmath5 , between cuo@xmath1 layers @xmath6 , through @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for thermal and disorder average .",
    "since @xmath5 intimately depends on the alignment of pv stacks , jpr can in principle be used to detect and identify different vortex phases .",
    "the bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals ( @xmath3  k ) were cut from a larger underdoped bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal , grown by the travelling solvent floating zone technique .",
    "the jpr was measured using the cavity perturbation technique in the tm@xmath9 modes , with the microwave electrical field aligned along the sample @xmath0-axis .",
    "two orthogonal coils were used to apply field components parallel ( @xmath10 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath11 ) to the cuo@xmath1 layers .",
    "varying the mode @xmath12 , allowed us to change the jpr frequency and to probe both the vortex solid and the liquid state .",
    "magnetic - field dependance of the microwave absorption ( arbitrary units ) of a bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal obtained at different frequencies . ]    figure [ fig : dissipation ] shows the microwave absorption obtained by sweeping @xmath11 at constant @xmath10 and temperature .",
    "when @xmath13 , the jpr is identified as the maximum of the microwave absorption , for the field @xmath14 ( arrows in figure [ fig : dissipation ] ) . following the evolution of the absorption ,",
    "the lineshape is modified by @xmath10 in two ways .",
    "first , the intensity of the microwave response decreases for all frequencies .",
    "it has been pointed out that the presence of a josephson vortex lattice ( jvl ) strongly modulates the _ c_-axis critical current@xcite .",
    "thus , the jpr can not develop in the stacks of jvs .",
    "however , for low values of the in - plane field ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the anisotropy ratio and @xmath17 the interlayer distance ) , the distance between two stacks of jvs is sufficiently high so that the phase remains unaffected far from the cores .",
    "the remaining microwave absorption mainly arises from jv - free regions , the extent of which decreases linearly with @xmath10 .",
    "second , @xmath10 changes the field @xmath14 at which the maximum absorption occurs : the decrease of @xmath14 observed in the vortex solid at 31.2 and 39.4 ghz implies the decrease of @xmath18 and is consistent with the addition of a jvl .",
    "however , for 19.2 and 22.9 ghz , @xmath14 , measured in the vortex liquid , _",
    "increases_.    the @xmath14-loci for different temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] together with the pv vortex lattice melting line in @xmath13 .",
    "the increase of @xmath14 is only observed in the vortex liquid state and for sufficiently low pv densities . in the solid phase ,",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the addition of pvs on a dense lattice of jvs ( @xmath19 ) increases the @xmath0-axis critical current : the pvs adjust their positions to the jvl so as to maximize @xmath18@xcite .",
    "the same effect could be present in the vortex liquid phase , giving rise to an effective attraction between pvs and jvs and to a _ correlated vortex liquid _ in which the density of pvs is smaller in jv - free regions .",
    "since the microwave absorption due to the jpr mainly comes from those regions , increasing @xmath10 also increases @xmath14 .",
    "however , even though the presence of well - defined josephson vortices in the presence of a pv liquid is still controversial , we believe that it can be the case for low densities of pvs .",
    "the correlated vortex liquid is therefore stable close to the pv melting line , for low values of the perpendicular magnetic field ."
