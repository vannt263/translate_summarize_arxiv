    "we review the known mev emission processes that correlate with star - formation here .",
    "most of the observed @xmath0-ray emission from galaxies comes from crs .",
    "the gev - tev emission is probably pionic , because the injection rate of cr protons exceeds that of the primary cr electrons by a factor @xmath19 at gev energies in the milky way .",
    "even weak pionic losses as in the milky way are sufficient to overwhelm the leptonic emission at these energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "_ inverse compton ( ic ) emission _",
    " inverse compton arises when a cr @xmath21 compton scatters an ambient photon , boosting its energy in the observer frame .",
    "the ic emission is expected to form a broad continuum , because the upscattered photon energy scales as the square of the electron energy ( in the thomson limit ) .",
    "it likely dominates the milky way nonthermal continuum at 100 kev @xcite . below the klein - nishina cutoff , electrons of energy @xmath22 will typically upscatter photons of energy @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "ambient photons can come from the cmb , far - infrared ( fir ) emission from dust , or intragalactic stellar uv / optical / infrared backgrounds ; in the milky way , these all have similar energy densities , while in starburst galaxies , the fir emission dominates .",
    "each of the radiation fields are roughly greybody fields with a temperature @xmath25 and average photon energy @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , typical upscattered photon energies are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for electrons of energy @xmath30 upscattering the cmb , fir , and optical radiation fields .",
    "ic from each of the components is expected to have a @xmath31 photon index , if the cr @xmath21 have a steady - state power law spectrum @xmath32 .",
    "the cmb energy density grows rapidly with redshift .",
    "ic upscattering off a strong high-@xmath3 cmb can take energy away from other cooling processes , essentially quenching the radio luminosity of a galaxy and transferring the power into mev emission @xcite . at high energies ,",
    "the cmb must overcome the inverse compton losses off the starlight and the synchrotron losses in the magnetic field .",
    "thus , this effect is only important when @xmath33 , or @xmath34 in milky way - like galaxies with @xmath35 and starlight energy density @xmath36 , the cmb overwhelms the other losses before @xmath37 .",
    "however , in starburst galaxies with @xmath38 , the cmb remains unimportant out to @xmath39 . at low electron energies , escape , bremsstrahlung , and ionization losses `` buffer '' the radio spectrum against the cmb effect to even higher redshift @xcite .",
    "finally , cr @xmath21 can escape into the halos of galaxies , where they cool by inverse compton emission .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that about @xmath40 of the power injected into cr electrons in the milky way is lost to inverse compton cooling , with greater ic luminosities for larger halos .",
    "the majority of this emission is below 100 mev in most of their models , although the total @xmath41 emission is still about a third or less of the total @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "starburst galaxies are expected to be `` electron calorimeters '' , with most of the @xmath21 cooling in the starburst disk proper ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but radio haloes are observed in starbursts , indicating that some cr @xmath21 reach large heights off the plane @xcite .",
    "we do not consider these haloes further in this work .",
    "_ bremsstrahlung _  bremsstrahlung radiation is emitted by cr @xmath21 when they are deflected by the electric field of a nucleus .",
    "a typical bremsstrahlung photon has half the energy of the cr @xmath21 @xcite ; thus the bremsstrahlung spectrum has the same shape as the cr @xmath21 spectrum , which is set by the dominant cooling or escape mechanism for cr @xmath21 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung loss time of an @xmath21 with energy @xmath42 traversing pure hydrogen of number density @xmath43 is @xmath44 , but the ionization loss time is @xmath45^{-1}$ ] where @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thus ionization losses therefore quickly softens both the cr @xmath21 and bremsstrahlung emission spectrum below @xmath47 , independent of density .",
    "likewise , ic and synchrotron losses harden the cr @xmath21 spectrum at high energies , since they go as @xmath48 .",
    "the result is a `` bremsstrahlung bump '' peaking at a few hundred mev , where the energy - independent bremsstrahlung losses are most important .",
    "thus , leptonic emission may itself be peaked near 100 mev , even without hadronic emission .",
    "a low energy bremsstrahlung tail can be generated only if the injected electron spectrum is very steep ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    _ synchrotron and other emission from tev - pev @xmath21 _  synchrotron emission from cr @xmath21 deflected in a galaxy s magnetic field is responsible for the low frequency radio emission of galaxies , but it can also extend to x - rays and @xmath0-rays . at mev - emitting energies ,",
    "there are few @xmath21 injected , but there are no competing cooling processes ( ic is suppressed by klein - nishina effects ) .",
    "the typical energy of synchrotron photons is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the @xmath21 energy in pev and @xmath51 is the magnetic field strength . in the milky way ,",
    "the low magnetic field strength combined with the lack of ic emission observed at @xmath52 energies implies that there is little large scale high - energy synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields of starbursts are constrained to be much higher in starbursts like those in m82 and ngc 253 ( @xmath53 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , so that synchrotron may be important at x - ray @xcite and perhaps @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "synchrotron has a photon index of @xmath54 , steepening greatly at the tail of the cr @xmath21 spectrum .",

    "@xmath0 is @xmath55 compared to the synchrotron photon energy of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the plasma frequency , @xmath58 is the cyclotron frequency , and typically @xmath59 .",
    "however , electrostatic bremsstrahlung is only important if the energy density in electrostatic waves reaches the magnetic energy density ; since this is not known , we ignore the process for the rest of the work .",
    "nearly thermalized positrons can annihilate with ism electrons into 511 kev photons , or they can form positronium atoms which can emit 3-photon annihilation continuum at energies below 511 kev as well as 511 kev photons .",
    "a bright source of annihilation radiation is detected from the galactic center bulge , with a flux and spatial distribution not consistent with star formation @xcite , but additional positron emission is detected from the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the positron generation rate in the galactic disk is consistent with a nucleosynthetic origin in the fission of isotopes like @xmath2al produced by massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we consider this star - formation component of positrons , but not the ( dominant in the milky way ) bulge source of positrons in this paper .",
    "the bulge positrons may be due to activity by sgr a@xmath60 and there may not be an analogous population in all star - forming galaxies .",
    "in addition , cr positrons can annihilate while they are still relativistic ( in - flight annihilation or ia ) , although most cr positrons survive to rest .",
    "pionic positrons , produced alongside pionic @xmath0-rays , are injected at energies @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "if we approximate the hadronic positron injection spectrum as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and since @xmath64 are cooled primarily by ionization ( which has a cooling rate roughly independent of energies ) at @xmath65 , the steady - state low - energy hadronic positron spectrum should have a nearly constant @xmath66 .",
    "it can then be shown that the annihilation radiation from hadronic positrons is hard , with @xmath67 @xcite , so that @xmath68 peaks near 100 mev .",

    "however , some processes in old stellar populations , particularly novae , may also synthesize isotopes that emit @xmath0-ray lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gamma - ray lines from nuclear decay in the ism are narrow ; galactic observations of the @xmath2al line constrain line widths to be less than @xmath71 @xcite , but the line emission from a redshift distribution of galaxies will be smeared out into a continuum .",

    "as the fraction of cosmic star formation in starbursts approaches unity , the observed gev @xmath0-ray background is produced even if the normal galaxies do not evolve ( figure  [ fig : fsbback ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the gev background prediction is roughly an order of magnitude . * in our fiducial model , star - forming galaxies make up only @xmath400 of the 1 mev background and @xmath362 of the 10 mev background ( figure  [ fig : gammabackground ] ) .",
    "much of this emission is ic from normal galaxies , but there are also important contributions from @xmath0-ray lines from ccsne , positron annihilation , and @xmath2al decay . as with the gev background , we find an order of magnitude spread in the mev background predictions depending on our assumptions . * to account for the uncertainties in @xmath0-ray luminosity normalization , we derive more robust limits on the mev contribution from the spectral shape of star - forming galaxies . according to these constraints",
    ", normal galaxies could make at most half of the 100 mev background and 1 ( evolving ) to 9% ( non - evolving ) of the 10 mev background ( figure  [ fig : mwscaledbackground ] ) .",
    "similarly , high-@xmath113 starbursts could make up at most @xmath422 of the 100 mev background and 2% of the 10 mev background .",
    "if starbursts have weak @xmath113 and substantial leptonic emission , these fractions could be higher , with @xmath374 of the 10 mev background allowed to be from starbursts ( figure  [ fig : m82scaledbackground ] ) .    in short , while star - forming galaxies can ( and according to our models , do ) provide a substantial fraction of the gev @xmath0-ray background , they are a minor contributor of the mev background . the reason why the mev background can not be explained by star - forming galaxies is simply that the @xmath0-ray background is _ very steep _ : a lot more power is required at mev energies than at gev energies . thus , even if star - forming galaxies do have enough luminosity at gev energies , and even if the spectrum is flat at mev energies ( as is the case for the non - evolving normal galaxy templates ) , this is insufficient for the observed background .",
    "thus , there must be some other explanation for the mev background .",
    "the simplest explanation would be some other source that peaks at mev energies .",
    "but this just again raises the mystery of why the mev - gev @xmath0-ray background appears to be a featureless power law if there are different sources responsible at different energies @xcite .",
    "it is possible this is sheer coincidence .",
    "for example , current blazar models of the @xmath0-ray background invoke a coincidence with soft flat spectrum radio quasars at low energies and hard bl lacs at high energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we should also keep in mind that the featureless power law in figure  [ fig : gammabackground ] is actually for the currently unresolved background .",
    "the distinction between unresolved and resolved sources is an experimental one ( see the huge sensitivity gap in figure  [ fig : futuremev ] between comptel and _ fermi_-lat ) , not necessarily one with fundamental astrophysical significance . the resolution of sources is much better at gev energies than mev energies , and the _ resolved _",
    "@xmath0-ray blazars would add a large component on top of the unresolved background .",
    "finally , the reported mev background could simply be incorrect ( due to detector backgrounds ) or galactic in origin .",
    "our conclusions can be evaded if there are extremely high amounts of low energy crs below the pion production threshold , or extremely large contributions from discrete mev sources .",
    "ic emission from escaping @xmath21 in the halos around normal galaxies can increase the mev emission , but since the ic emission is a broad continuum extending to gev energies , the spectral shape constraints imply that this emission does not make up all of the mev background .",
    "low energy spikes of cr electrons can enhance the bremsstrahlung and ic emission , but can be constrained with synchrotron radio .",
    "an extreme enhancement of mev nuclei might even increase the nuclear line emission enough to alter the sed , although the ionization rate from these nuclei should also be extreme .",
    "discrete sources are not expected to be dominant , based on observations of the milky way , so a new significant mev source population would have to scale non - linearly with star - formation rate .",
    "there are several indirect tests of our predictions .",
    "a key distinction between our evolving and non - evolving templates for normal galaxies is that inverse compton on the cmb losses overwhelmingly dominate the electron lifetime in the latter case .",
    "this comes at the expense of other losses  particularly synchrotron .",
    "thus at high @xmath3 , it has long been expected that galaxies should be radio - faint compared to expectations from their infrared luminosities @xcite .",
    "in contrast , observations indicate that galaxies lie on the empirical @xmath361 infrared  radio correlation to relatively high @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even are radio - bright ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at high @xmath3 , these observations probe galaxies with high star - formation rates and possibly more starburst - like , where the effects of the cmb are expected to be weak",
    "however , new instruments like the karl g. jansky very large array and eventually square kilometer array may probe milky way  like galaxies , and determine the effects of the stronger cmb .",
    "further measurements extending the hard x - rays and the high energy @xmath0-rays towards the mev range may prove constraining for the starbursts .",
    "_ fermi_-lat should ultimately reach down to 30 mev . at these energies the pion bump should fall off in the high-@xmath113 models , but the leptonic emission peaks in the low-@xmath113 models .",
    "fermi_-lat can help constrain @xmath113 in the nearest starbursts .",
    "fermi_-lat data will resolve out additional blazars @xcite , which would constrain the true contribution of star - forming galaxies to the gev background and limit their contribution to the mev background . in the hard x - ray regime ,",
    "measurements of the 10  100 kev luminosity of starbursts would limit their ic emission , helping constrain @xmath113 , and synchrotron emission , which can be significant to @xmath250 in some of our models .",
    "better mev instruments may also help us understand the emission mechanisms of @xmath0-rays in this energy range within the milky way , particularly the contribution of discrete sources . as noted in section  [ sec : mwmodel ] , there is a spectral plateau around @xmath340 observed by comptel that is not present in either galprop or our models ( figure  [ fig : mwgamma ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy is poorly understood , and implies that either there is something we do not know about galactic mev emission , or there are unaccounted for systematics in the comptel spectrum of the milky way .",
    "the discrepancy by itself can not explain the mev background  the milky way is less luminous at 10 mev than at 1 gev , unlike the background  but it may increase the predicted background by a factor of a few .    however , direct measurements of the 1  30 mev emission of star - forming galaxies beyond the milky way and possibly the magellanic clouds seem far off . in figure",
    "[ fig : futuremev ] , we plot the fiducial high-@xmath113 model of m82 compared to the sensitivities of current ( grey ) and possible future ( light grey ) @xmath0-ray instruments . in x - rays and gev - tev @xmath0-rays , the highly sensitive instruments we have now allow detection of these starbursts .",
    "however , comptel , the best instrument over much of the mev band , is about three orders of magnitude behind _ fermi_-lat . nor would proposed next - generation instruments like mega ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or grips @xcite be able to detect the nonthermal emission from m82 .",
    "but even a mev instrument as sensitive as _ fermi_-lat , such as act @xcite , might not detect m82 from 1  10 mev : the pion bump in the fiducial model means that these galaxies are much fainter in the mev band than in the gev band .",
    "we also consider m31 by scaling the milky way fiducial model to the star - formation rate of m31 ( @xmath423 ; @xcite ) and using a distance of 780 kpc @xcite . it may be possible to detect m31 with act , because the mev - gev spectrum is softer than m82 .",
    "thus , vastly more powerful mev telescopes are required to directly observe the mev emission of individual star - forming galaxies ; such improvements may be feasible with new @xmath0-ray optics technologies , as in @xcite .",
    "the origin of the mev ( and gev ) background can be tested by the anisotropies in the background @xcite .",
    "normal galaxies are expected to have a very weak anisotropy signal @xcite , while blazars have strong anisotropy signals @xcite .",
    "the signal for starbursts has not yet been calculated , but is probably stronger than normal galaxies ; anisotropies in the submillimeter associated with submillimeter galaxies have been detected @xcite .",
    "in our fiducial model , normal galaxies contribute more to the background than starbursts at both mev and gev energies .",
    "a future mev experiment could therefore search for the star - forming galaxy contribution by looking for a uniformly distributed component to the mev background .",
    "further studies of the starburst contribution to background anisotropies , and a better treatment of galaxy evolution , is necessary to evaluate this effect .    in short",
    ", the sheer power of the mev background as reported requires many luminous sources , and star - forming galaxies simply are not bright enough to be its origin .",
    "how the mev and gev backgrounds join up so seamlessly is unclear , since star - forming galaxies seem to make up at least @xmath11 and plausibly a majority of the gev background .",
    "future mev instruments must be improved , possibly by many orders of magnitude , to solve the riddle of its source .",
