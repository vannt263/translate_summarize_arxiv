    "it has been known for some time that powerful ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) radio galaxies undergo strong cosmic evolution , with density enhancements , over the local value , ranging from @xmath4 , to 1001000 for the most luminous sources at redshifts 12 ( e.g. wall et al .",
    "these results were supported by dunlop & peacock ( * ? ? ? * hereafter dp90 ) who found that including a high luminosity , strongly evolving population in their modelling of the radio luminosity function fitted the data well .",
    "the increased difficulty in detecting lower powered radio galaxies over comparable distances means that their evolutionary behaviour is less clear .",
    "initial , low redshift studies , suggested that they had a constant space density ( e.g. jackson & wall @xcite ) and this was subsequently supported at higher redshift by clewley & jarvis @xcite .",
    "however , dp90 found that their models were better fit if the low luminosity population was weakly evolving , and sadler et al .",
    "@xcite , using a sample selected in a similar way to that of clewley & jarvis , found that the no  evolution scenario is ruled out at a significance level of @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , willott et al .",
    "@xcite , also see evolution in their low luminosity , weak emission line , population .",
    "this high / low power radio galaxy split corresponds to the division between fanaroff & riley class i and ii sources ( fri and frii ; fanaroff & riley , @xcite ) .",
    "of the two types , friis are the more powerful , but it should be noted that there is significant overlap at the break luminosity .",
    "the bulk of the emission in friis originates from the hotspots at the ends of their highly collimated , ` edge  brightened ' , jets .",
    "fris , on the other hand , typically have ` edge  darkened ' jets which are brighter towards their central regions and which also tend to flare out close to the nucleus .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the differences between the two classes arise from fundamental differences in their central engines ( e.g. advection dominated accretion flow in fris arising from a lower accretion rate ) as argued by e.g. @xcite , or whether it is the environments in which the jets of these objects reside which determines their observed properties ( e.g. gopal  krishna & wiita @xcite and gawroski et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or even some combination of the two .    an important tool , therefore , for investigating the morphological differences between the two fr classes comes from measurements of their cosmic evolution . since the fri / frii break luminosity is not fixed , but is a function of host galaxy magnitude @xcite , morphological classification of the radio galaxies in a sample is a necessity if an accurate picture of the cosmic evolution of fris is to be obtained .",
    "any similarities detected in the variation of fris and friis over cosmic time lends weight to the extrinsic , environmental , model since objects with similar underlying properties , at the same luminosity , would be expected to evolve similarly as well .",
    "if this is the case , then it implies that fris and friis may simply represent different stages in the evolution of a radio galaxy , which , in this scenario , would start as a high luminosity frii with powerful jets , which then weakens and dims over time ( e.g. willott et al .",
    "@xcite ; kaiser & best @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to clarifying the fri / ii differences , the cosmic evolution of fris in particular may also be important for galaxy formation and evolution models , which are increasingly using radio galaxies to provide the feedback necessary to halt the problem of massive galaxy overgrowth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "best et al .",
    ", @xcite suggest that it is the lower luminosity sources , perhaps the fri population alone , that are mainly responsible for this .",
    "understanding their behaviour may therefore provide the key to understanding this mechanism as well .",
    "snellen & best @xcite made a first attempt at determining the space density of morphologically classified fris , using the two @xmath6 fris detected in the hubble deep and flanking fields ( hdf+ff ) area .",
    "the small number of sources meant that a direct calculation would have been unreliable , but they were able to show that the probability of detecting these two fris if the population undergoes no evolution was @xmath7% , and was instead consistent with a space density enhancement comparable to that of less luminous frii galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "more recently , jamrozy @xcite , using the number counts of two complete , morphologically classified , radio samples , also found that a positive cosmic evolution for the most luminous fri sources is needed to fit their observational data out to @xmath8 .",
    "the aim of this work is to improve on the results of these previous analyses using a deep , wide field , 1.4 ghz , very large array ( vla ) a  array survey , an order of magnitude larger than the hdf+ff ; this area is large enough to allow the space density to be directly measured for the first time .",
    "the survey was split over two fields of 0.29 sq .",
    "degrees each ",
    "one in the constellation of lynx at right ascension , @xmath9 , declination , @xmath10 ( j2000 ) and one in hercules at @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( j2000 )  which were originally observed as part of the leiden  berkeley deep survey ( lbds ; kron , @xcite ; koo & kron , @xcite ) .",
    "these fields are ideal for this work due to the existence of previous low resolution ( 12.5 ) radio observations ( windhorst et al .",
    "@xcite ; oort & windhorst @xcite ; oort & van langevelde @xcite ) . these can be used , in conjunction with higher resolution data , to look for flux density losses in the sample , which in turn can be used for fri classification ( see  [ class_sec ] for full details ) . alongside this , the hercules field has some previous optical and spectroscopic observations by waddington et al . ,",
    "@xcite , whilst the lynx field is also covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "@xcite ; stoughton et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the survey consists of a complete sample of 81 radio sources , evenly spread over the two fields , all above the limiting flux density , @xmath13 , of 0.5 mjy in the a ",
    "array radio data .",
    "optical and infra  red observations with the isaac newton telescope ( int ) and the uk infra  red telescope ( ukirt ) respectively , resulted in a host  galaxy identification fraction of 85% , with 12 sources remaining unidentified at a level of _ _ r@xmath14__@xmath1525.2 mag ( hercules ; 4 sources ) or _ _ r@xmath14__@xmath1524.4 mag ( lynx ; 7 sources ) or _ _ k__@xmath1620 mag .",
    "new spectroscopic data obtained with the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , combined with previously published results meant that the redshift completeness was 49% . the redshifts for the remaining sources with a host galaxy detection were estimated using either the k  z or r  z magnitude ",

    "array observations was to provide a measure of the total flux density for each field source , and to look for any extended emission that may have been resolved out in the 1.5  resolution a  array data presented in paper i. complimentary observations of the hercules field in this configuration were not done due to time constraints .",
    "the observations took place on 30th october 2003 , in l  band ( 1.4 ghz ) , using the wide  field mode .",
    "the flux , point and phase calibrators used were 3c286 , 3c147 and 0828 + 493 respectively and the total exposure time on the field was 7000s ; this was split into five periods which were interspersed with @xmath21120s visits to the phase calibrator .",
    "8 channels , at frequencies of 1.474 and 1.391 ghz , with a total bandwidth of 25  mhz , were used , to minimise bandwidth smearing effects . full polarization was observed .",
    "the data were calibrated using the nrao aips package . since sources located at all positions in the final radio image need to be considered , the non  coplanar array wide  field imaging techniques , incorporated into the aips task imagr , were used .",
    "the field was split into facets , centred on the positions of each source from the a ",

    "the deconvolution and cleaning of each facet was done using 5000 iterations and nearly natural weighting to minimise the noise in the resulting clean image .",
    "no self  calibration was carried out due to the weakness of the sources .",
    "the final noise level reached for all the facets was @xmath2150 @xmath22jy / beam , with a resolution of 5.36  by 4.67 .",
    "finally a primary beam correction was applied to each image to account for the attenuation of the beam away from the pointing centre .",

    "law , with a steeper slope , for the higher powered sources , above the luminosity break ) shifts horizontally in the @xmath24@xmath25 plane only , and its overall shape does not change .",
    "these redshift changes were confined to the luminosity normalization , @xmath26 , only and dp90 parameterized these as a quadratic in @xmath27 .",
    "conversely , in the lde model , the local rlf can move both horizontally and vertically and , therefore , can steepen or flatten . as a result ,",
    "dp90 allowed the density normalization , @xmath28 , to also vary with redshift . for full details of these two models ,",
    "the reader is referred to section 3.4 of dp90 .    for each of these two models ,",
    "the total number of sources in the interval @xmath29 was found by integrating @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the area of the survey in steradians and the luminosity limits of the integration are @xmath32 w / hz and @xmath33 w / hz . the co  efficients used in these calculations were those determined for the steep spectrum population by dp90 .",
    "where necessary these values were converted from their original 2.7 ghz to 1.4 ghz , the frequency used here , again assuming an average @xmath34 of 0.8 . changing this assumption",
    "does not significantly alter the final results .",
    "additionally , since the dp90 models were determined using einstein de sitter ( edes ) cosmology , the luminosity limits actually used for the integration were the edes values corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 at each redshift step to ensure that the correct , concordance cosmology , values of @xmath37 were found .",
    "carrying out the integrations results in @xmath38 for both models , over this redshift range , and corresponding enhancements over the local value used here of  8 .",
    "this expected number agrees very well with the observed numbers of 7 , 11 and 13 for the minimum , probable and maximum samples , confirming that these space densities can be consistent with these models .",
    "the subsequent probabilities arising from these numbers can again be found in table [ prob_table ] .",
    "this result is further supported by figure [ dens_fig1 ] , in which the density values predicted by the ple and lde models are overplotted with the results previously calculated for the 4 redshift bins .",
    "the low redshift disagreement seen between the models and the local fri space density is likely to arise from the poor constraints locally , at these radio powers , in the dp90 results .",
    "the space density calculation can be repeated using different luminosity limits to investigate the behaviour of the weaker sources in the sample .",
    "figures [ 245_dens ] and [ 24_dens ] show the results of this for limits of 10@xmath39 and 10@xmath40 w / hz and the density values are given in table [ calc_table ] .",
    "the calculation was , in both cases , carried out for the minimum , maximum and probable numbers of fri , using redshift bins of width 0.5 , with the final bin dependent on the value of the limiting luminosity as discussed previously .",
    "the local values were again found using a combination of the 3cr and equatorial galaxy samples .",
    "the space density changes in redshift bins of width 0.5 , plotted at the bin midpoints for p@xmath41 w / hz . for comparison the redshift axis is plotted with the same range as in figure [ dens_fig1 ] and the ple and lde models of dp90 are again shown , along with poisson errors for the probable group of objects . ]",
    "the space density changes in redshift bins of width 0.5 , plotted at the bin midpoints for p@xmath42 w / hz . for comparison the redshift axis is plotted with the same range as in figure [ dens_fig1 ] and the ple and lde models of dp90 are again shown , along with poisson errors for the probable group of objects . ]    the comoving space densities for these two new limits indicate that the enhancement over the local values in both cases is smaller than that seen when @xmath43 w / hz ( figure [ dens_fig1 ] ) . these results are supported by the work of sadler et al .",
    "@xcite who found that the cosmic evolution of their low power ( @xmath44 w / hz ) population was significant but less rapid than that seen for their higher powered sources .    inspection of figures [ 245_dens ] and [ 24_dens ] also suggests that the peak comoving density moves to lower redshifts at lower luminosities , though the large errors on these results , and the restricted redshift range sampled at these low powers prohibit strong conclusions from being drawn .",
    "the radio observations presented here , along with the data previously presented in paper i , allowed the 81 sources of the complete sample to be classified into 5 groups : group 1 was for secure , morphologically classified , fris ; group 2 for sources with indications of fri  type extension , alongside a flux density loss of 3@xmath45 or more ; group 3 for sources with either flux density loss or some extension , and groups 4 and 5 for sources which were either definitely not fris or which were unclassifiable .",
    "the fris in the sample , together with the two fris in the hubble deep and flanking fields , were then used to calculate the maximum , probable and minimum space densities over the range @xmath46 .",
    "the main results of this calculation are listed below .",
    "1 .   clear density enhancements , by a factor 59 , were seen at @xmath47 , over the local fri value , for fris brighter than @xmath48 w / hz , 2 .",
    "this result is secure , with the main source of error arising from the low number of sources in the fri subsample , 3 .",
    "the no  evolution scenario was ruled out at the @xmath4999.9% confidence limit , 4 .",
    "the results were consistent with previously published models which in turn suggests that , at a particular radio power , fris evolve like friis . 5 .",
    "the results also indicate that the fri evolution may be luminosity dependent , with lower powered sources evolving less strongly , and the peak in space density possibly moving to lower redshifts for weaker objects .",
    "now that the space density enhancements of this sample have been determined it is useful to compare them to the results of previous work .",
    "sadler et al .",
    "@xcite , for instance , found increases in space density , out to @xmath50 , by a factor of  2  10 for the high ( @xmath51 w / hz ) luminosity radio galaxies in their sample ; these are consistent with the range of enhancements (  5   9 ) to @xmath0 seen in the large redshift bin here .",
    "jamrozy et al .",
    "@xcite also find that positive evolution , this time ple , of the form @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 and the evolution rate , @xmath54 , was found to be 5.0 ) , is necessary to fit the number counts of the highest luminosity , morphologically selected , fris in their sample . at @xmath55",
    "this corresponds to an enhancement of 25 which is significantly higher than that seen here .",
    "additionally , willott et al .",
    "@xcite see a rise of about one dex , between @xmath56 and @xmath0 , in the comoving space density of their low luminosity , weak emission line , population which contains mainly fri sources , along with some friis .",
    "it should be noted that other studies of radio galaxy evolution do not directly measure the amount of space density evolution present in their samples .",
    "instead they test for evolution using the @xmath57 statistic and therefore can not be directly compared to the results of this work .    in general",
    ", all the previous studies of radio galaxy evolution conclude that the more luminous sources undergo more cosmic evolution . for samples in which the fri population was determined by a luminosity cut",
    ", this tends to imply little or no evolution for these sources ( e.g. the lower luminosity sources of clewley & jarvis ( 2004 ) show no evolution , whereas evolution is seen for sources of comparable luminosity to those here ) .",
    "however , for samples which either morphologically classify their sources or which apply a different dual  population scheme ( e.g. the low / high luminosity division based on line luminosity of willott et al .",
    "@xcite ) , evolution of at least some of the fris objects is typically seen .",
    "it would seem , therefore , that the previous models in which all fris have constant space density , whereas all friis undergo strong , positive , cosmic evolution , are too simplistic and do not accurately represent the behaviour of the fri  type objects . a better representation of the fri / ii space density evolution seen here and in other work , is the picture in which as the luminosity of a source increases , so does the amount of positive evolution it undergoes between z  0 and 12 .",
    "it should be noted though that the behaviour of the low power fris is not throughly investigated here , but the evolution seen for higher power objects is consistent with this model .",
    "the detection in this work of fri space density enhancements for sources with @xmath58 w / hz , along with the previous studies which find essentially luminosity dependent evolution for the fri population , strongly suggests that neither the intrinsic or the extrinsic difference models can fully explain the observed fri / ii differences . when radio galaxies are divided according to their line luminosities , as in willott et al .",
    "@xcite , there are both fri and frii sources in the low excitation , low luminosity , population ; this implies that these friis may also have inefficient accretion flows similar to those previously proposed for fris ( e.g. ghisellini & celotti 2001 ) .",
    "jets produced by low accretion flow sources are generally weak with the majority having an fri type structure , whereas higher accretion flows give rise to stronger , mainly frii type jets . in this scenario",
    "therefore , both low and high accretion flows are capable of producing both fr jet structures and the morphological differences between the two classes can be explained extrinsically , as a function of their individual environments , whilst the differences in line luminosity can be explained intrinsically , as a function of their black hole properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary ,",
    "therefore , combining these results with the previously published work in this field leads to the conclusion that the intrinsic / extrinsic models used to describe the differences in radio sources are too simplistic , and that what is needed is some combination of the two . dividing radio galaxies according to line luminosity , instead of according to their observed morphology , may be the answer as , in this classification , weak , inefficiently accreting , friis can be grouped together with fris .",
