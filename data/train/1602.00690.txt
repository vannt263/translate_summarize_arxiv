    "here , we extend on previous attempts to model the cosmological distribution of planets by coupling semi - analytical models of galaxy formation to a recipe for planet formation that depends on both stellar mass and stellar metallicity . using this machinery , we predict the spatial and temporal distribution of terrestrial planets ( hereafter tps ) in both the local and distant universe . throughout this paper ,",

    "further investigations by e.g. suggests that the power law can not be described by the same parameters for solar type stars ( fgk ) and low - mass m - dwarfs , implying that there is also a mass correlation embedded in the prevalence of giant planets . here ,",
    "we approximate the probability of forming giant planets @xmath16 as the giant planet occurrence rate @xmath17 described by : @xmath18 , m _ * ) = f_0 10^{a [ \\mathrm{fe / h } ] } m_*^b , \\label{pfg_eq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the mass of the star in solar masses , @xmath20 a constant factor estimated to be 0.07 by , @xmath21 is the metallicity parameter estimated to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 for spectral types fgk and m respectively and @xmath24 the mass correlation parameter assumed to be 1 .",
    "following @xcite , we assess the probability of harboring tps , @xmath25 , by estimating the number of tps formed as described above , and appraise how many are destroyed by migrating giant planets described by equation (  [ eq : recipe ] ) as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the probability of forming a tp and @xmath28 is the probability of forming a close - orbit giant planet , thus destroying the prospect of harboring a tp in the process .",
    "this approach admittedly neglects the intriguing possibility that tps may reform in the wake of a migrating jupiter or otherwise survive the ordeal .",
    "moreover , by adopting the parameter values for equation  ( [ pfg_eq ] ) from , we are implicitly assuming that all close - in giant planets considered in their study ( orbital period @xmath29 years ) are detrimental for tps  including those that would be classified as warm rather than hot jupiters .",
    "this likely overestimates the impact of close - in giants on the prevalence of tps , since some warm jupiters are known to have tp companions @xcite . because of these uncertainties , we in section  [ results ] present the fraction of tps that is predicted to be lost due to close - in giants , so that the size of the population potentially missing from our inventory may be estimated .",
    "it is very likely that the probability of forming tps requires a minimum threshold of metallicity for the host star . at the low - metallicity end",

    "the probability to form earth - like planets is envisioned as a step function going from zero probability to maximum probability at [ fe / h]@xmath30 . in our baseline model ,",
    "we instead include stars with metallicities all the way down to [ fe / h]@xmath31 , which corresponds to the level where the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite would have insufficient solid materials to form a terrestrial planet ( @xmath32 ) in an earth - like orbit .",
    "since stars at such low metallicites would most likely struggle to form terrestrial planets , we adopt a @xmath33 function that includes a smooth cut - off @xmath34 at the low - metallicity end : @xmath35 here , we adopt @xmath36 for m dwarfs and @xmath37 for fgk stars and a low - metallicity cut - off given by : @xmath38 for @xmath39 [ fe / h ] @xmath40 , but @xmath41 for [ fe / h ] @xmath42 .",
    "we also assume that the probability for tp formation stays constant at [ fe / h ] @xmath43 with @xmath44 at all higher metallicities .",
    "the function @xmath34 is admittedly arbitrarily chosen , but as we demonstrate in section  [ local ] and  [ planet_formation_uncertainties ] , the exact choice of cut - off function has an insignificant impact on our results .    to be consistent with the isochrones used to estimate stellar lifetimes ( see section [ galaxy_formation ] ) ,",

    "our probability distribution for the occurrence of tps around fgk stars is far less peaked around the solar value than that of @xcite , but still features a high - metallicity drop - off less pronounced than that of @xcite .",

    "this is not likely to affect our results in any significant ways , since both our own models and extrapolations of the observed galaxy stellar mass function to lower - mass objects @xcite indicate that the fraction of stellar mass locked up in @xmath58 galaxies is at the sub - percent level .    from every redshift",
    ", we extract the internal age and metallicity distribution of the stars of all galaxies . by adopting the @xcite universal stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ,",
    "we derive the number of fgk type ( assumed mass range 0.61.2 @xmath59 ) and m dwarf ( 0.080.6 @xmath59 ) subtypes in each metallicity and age bin . according to this imf , @xmath60 of all stars in the 0.08120 @xmath59",
    "are born in the m dwarf mass regime whereas @xmath2 are born in the mass range of fgk stars .",
    "we then use mass- and metallicity - dependent main sequence lifetimes from the parsec v1.2s isochrones @xcite to remove dead stars from the inventory .",
    "in these models , the lifetimes increase with metallicity , going from @xmath61 gyr at @xmath62 to @xmath63 gyr at @xmath64 for a mass with a zero age main sequence mass of 1.0 @xmath59 .",
    "m dwarfs ( @xmath65 ) always have lifetimes longer than the present age of the universe throughout this metallicity range and are therefore never removed .",
    "the adopted lifetimes are based on scaled solar elemental abundances , and while non - solar abundance ratios will affect the lifetimes , the enhancement of individual elements at the 0.3 dex level is not expected to affects the lifetimes of fg stars by more than @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "finally , we apply the mass- and metallicity dependent planet occurrence recipe of section  [ planet_models ] to calculate the number of tps within the age and metallicity bin of each galaxy at every redshift .      when converting redshifts into time and computing cosmological volumes required to reconstruct our past light cone , we adopt a flat @xmath67 cold dark matter ( @xmath67cdm ) cosmology with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and hubble constant @xmath70 km s@xmath71 mpc@xmath71 @xcite , giving a current age to the universe of @xmath72 gyr .",

    ", the global number of tps per stellar population mass has a current average of @xmath73 at redshift @xmath54 .",
    "since m dwarfs greatly outnumber the fgk stars , this quantity is completely dominated by tps around m dwarfs , and the corresponding value for tps around fgk hosts is about 30 times lower ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "close - in giants are expected to have diminished the current population of tps around fgk stars by no more than @xmath75 . given our assumptions in section  [ planet_models ] , this fraction is even smaller for m dwarfs ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "by @xmath54 , the exhausted lifetimes of fgk host stars have reduced the tp population around such stars by @xmath77 , although this fraction varies slightly with galaxy mass .      as shown in table  [ statistics_local ] , the average age of tps around fgk stars and m dwarfs is currently @xmath78 gyr and @xmath79 gyr , respectively ( i.e. 2.8 and 3.9 gyr older than earth , respectively ) .",
    "the oldest tps in our simulation have ages of around @xmath80 gyr ( by comparison , the oldest tp known so far has an age of @xmath81 gyr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for the slightly lower ages of fgk host planets is mainly due to the shorter lifetimes of such stars .",
    "however , the fraction of fgk planets lost due to the exhausted lifetimes of their host stars is no more than 35% , since only the most massive stars ( mass higher than @xmath82 , although with a slight metallicity dependence ) have main sequence lifetimes shorter than the current age of the universe .",

    "however , the habitability of super - earths ( @xmath84 ) is still a matter of debate .",
    "@xcite argue that super - earths need to be studied in individual cases , as those that develop a gaseous envelope may not be very habitable .",
    "@xcite also argue for a metallicity dependency for the potential habitability of super - earths , arguing that super - earths around metal - poor stars are found on tighter orbits than super - earths around more metal - rich stars . by removing super - earths from our estimates ( and",
    "hence only include terrestrial planets of size @xmath85 ) using the relative distribution of sizes from @xcite for fgk hosts and @xcite for m - dwarf hosts , we reduce the occurrence rates of tps in habitable zones to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , i.e. a reduction by a factor of @xmath88 to the corresponding estimates including super - earths .        another open question is whether m - dwarfs can be associated with habitability in the same sense as solar - type stars . the inward migration of the habitable zone during the early stages of evolution of m dwarfs , along with the x - rays , extreme ultraviolet radiation and flares produced by these stars , may drastically erode a stable atmosphere and the prospects of liquid water ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "planets within the habitable zone of low - mass stars may also experience synchronous rotation and be tidally locked @xcite , leading to an unstable climate @xcite .",
    "hence , a most conservative approach could involve excluding m dwarfs from the habitability discussion altogether and simply consider the fgk planets in table [ statistics_local ] and [ statistics_highz ] . adopting this strategy and removing super - earths from the tp inventory",
    "would then scale down these estimates by a factor @xmath89 , giving @xmath90 habitable planets around fgk stars per unit total stellar population mass ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath91 habitable planets around fgk stars in the observable universe .    on galactic scales",

    "high - redshift galaxies have higher specific star formation rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a higher prevalence of active nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since high - redshift galaxies are also more compact @xcite , supernovae , gamma - ray burst and active galactic nuclei will affect larger number of planets , and the size evolution may also increase the oort cloud perturbations due to close encounters with other stars .",
    "if we assume that all currently habitable terrestrial planets have a small but non - zero probability to develop intelligent life at around the present cosmic epoch , then the probability distribution for the emergence of intelligent life is expected to trace the spatial distribution of such planets . in other words , we expect to find ourselves in the type of environments where most such terrestrial planets are located .",
    "it is of course entirely possible that earth could lie in the tail of this distribution , but this is an improbable outcome , and would violate the copernican / mediocrity principle .    by convolving the mass distribution of tps from figure  [ planetdist_lowz ] with the distribution of morphological types as a function of galaxy mass from @xcite or @xcite , we estimate that @xmath92 of tps are locked up in spheroid - dominated galaxies ( with @xmath88 in elliptical galaxies and @xmath93 early - type disks ) , and not in disk - dominated galaxies like the milky way ( likely morphological type sbc ) .",
    "hence , if earth had been randomly drawn from the cosmological population of tps , the most likely outcome would have been for it _ not _ to be located in a milky way - type system , but in an elliptical .",
    "while many spheroid - dominated galaxies do contain a disk component , and vice versa , tps in disks remain in minority even when the estimated stellar mass fractions in bona fide disks and spheroids @xcite are considered .",
    "this , by itself , does not constitute any significant violation of the copernican / mediocrity principle , since there is nothing conspicuously improbable ) about the type of host galaxy in which we happen to find ourself ( probability @xmath93 ) .",
    "however , the fact that the raw distribution of tps is not already heavily skewed towards disk galaxies results in a slight puzzle once other habitability constraints are factored in , as these seem to tip the scales even further in favour of ellipticals .    when considering the role of supernova sterilization on galactic habitability , @xcite argue that massive ellipticals  which exhibit much less current star formation activity than disks  should exhibit much _ better _ conditions for life than actively star - forming galaxies like the milky way , and that this boosts the relative number of habitable planets per total stellar mass by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in such galaxies at redshift @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that if our planet were randomly drawn from the cosmic distribution of habitable tps at @xmath54 , we should with @xmath94 probability expect to find our self living in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "but maybe there is more to the lottery than we have hitherto realized ? if supernovae are less detrimental for life than commonly assumed , or if some other life - threatening mechanism turns out to be more efficient in ellipticals than in disks , this could restore the balance between habitable tps in spheroids and disks .",
    "we note that there are several important differences between disks and spheroids that have so far received very little attention in the context of astrobiology  including the prevalence and properties of active galactic nuclei ( but see @xcite for a recent discussion on this ) , the propagation of cosmic rays and the fraction of stars in high - density regions .",
    "more detailed studies of the impact that mechanisms of this type can have on the habitability of planets may hopefully shed light on this matter .      while most seti projects have so far focused on the milky way , the case for extragalactic",
    "seti remains compelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the probability for the emergence of intelligent life is sufficiently small , we could well be the only advanced civilization in the milky way .",
    "if so , our only chance of detecting intelligent life elsewhere in the universe would be to extend the search radius .",
    "extragalactic seti would also seem the only way to gauge the prevalence of civilizations very high on the @xcite scale ( close to type iii ) , since the milky way does not appear to host such a super - civilization .    if one adopts the admittedly anthropocentric view that intelligent life primarily develops on tps , then our results have some bearing on the maximum distance to which it would make sense to push extragalactic seti .",
    "naively , one would expect that the probability for the emergence of an advanced civilization in an given cosmological volume is proportional to the number of tps , modulo some correction for habitability and age effects .    by extending the redshift limit of such searches ,",
    "one increases the cosmological volume probed , but since one is  due to the finite light travel time  at the same time probing earlier epochs in the history of the universe , the number of tps within the search radius does not increase indefinitely .",
    "as discussed in section  [ highz ] and shown in figure  [ planetsinsky]b , the cumulative growth of the number of planets in the observable universe slows down considerably beyond the peak of cosmic star formation ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "if one furthermore assumes that it typically takes several billion years for intelligent life to arise ( some 4.5 gyr in the case of humans  and please note that the @xcite argument suggests that the typical time scale may be much longer than this ) , then only the @xmath96 part of the universe becomes relevant .",
    "for tps older than earth , only a very small fraction ( @xmath97 ) will be at @xmath98 .",
    "when factoring in habitability considerations ( section  [ habitability ] ) , which will tend to further favour the low - density environment in the low - redshift universe , and the escalating difficulties in detecting signatures ( either signals or signs of astroengineering ) of intelligent lifeforms at large distances , it seems that the prospects of extragalactic seti should peak at redshifts below @xmath992 .",
    "a small number of previous studies have attempted to assess the properties  both ages and absolute numbers  of terrestrial or earth - like planets on cosmological scales .",
    "a coarse , early estimate of the total number of `` habitable planets '' ( without clearly defining what was meant by this ) in the observable universe was presented by @xcite .",
    "this estimate , despite being based on a different cosmological model and an unevolving galaxy population  happens to lie within two orders of magnitude of our more modern estimate . by assuming @xmath100 habitable planets per galaxy and @xmath100 galaxies in the universe ,",
    "wesson argues for @xmath101 habitable planets in the observable universe .",
    "this is of the same order as our estimate on the total number of tps ( table  [ statistics_highz ] ) and two orders of magnitudes higher than our estimate for the number of habitable planets around fgk stars ( section  [ habitability ] ) .",
    "@xcite estimate the average tp in the @xmath54 universe to be @xmath102 gyr older than earth . while consistent with our estimate within the errorbars , this is still 1 gyr lower than our best estimate for tps around fgk stars ( @xmath103 gyr older than earth ; see table  [ statistics_local ] ) .",
    "as far as we can tell , this discrepancy is largely driven by the much stronger metallicity dependence adopted by lineweaver , which pushes the peak of tp formation forward in time by cutting off planet formation at subsolar metallicities ( see figure [ planet_recipe ] for a comparison ) .    also present formation time statistics for earth - like planets ( assumed to make up a fixed fraction of tps around fgk stars ) both in milky way - mass galaxies and over cosmological volumes .",
    "this is not expected to exactly match the age statistics at @xmath54 that we present for fgk host tps in table  [ statistics_local ] and figure  [ age_vs_mass_lowz ] , since the current age distribution is affected both by the formation _ and _ demise of planets ( due to the exhausted lifetimes of their host stars ) . however , since lifetime effects are unimportant for m dwarfs , we can still compare our results for m dwarf tps with theirs to shed light on potential differences in the underlying computational machinery . in this case , we find that the difference in median ages is @xmath104 gyr .",
    "also report that there are @xmath105 earth - like planets on the past light cone , which  when taking into account the scaling factor of @xmath93 between our mutual definitions of _ terrestrial _ and _ earth - like _  lies within a factor of a few from our estimate .    a simple and commonly used exercise to estimate the number of terrestrial / habitable / earth - like planets in the observable universe is to adopt a literature value for the corresponding number in the milky way , assign this number to the large number of galaxies detected in a deep , high - redshift survey like the hubble ultra deep field or the hubble extreme deep field , and correct the outcome for the limited sky coverage of the survey .",
    "this estimate not only neglects differences in both metallicity and mass between high - redshift galaxies and the milky way , but also the completeness of the imaging survey used . due to the redshift evolution of the galaxy mass function ( e.g. *",
    "* ) and the redshift evolution of gas - phase metallicities in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , average galaxy masses and metallicties are both lower at high redshifts .",
    "the modest difference in the number of planets per stellar mass in the milky way compared to the cosmic average ( cmp .",
    "table [ statistics_local ] & [ statistics_highz ] ) implies that mass , according to our models , is more important in this context .",
    "if we were to adopt our estimate for the number of tps around fgkm stars in the milky way ( @xmath106 ; see section  [ local ] ) , multiply by the number of galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field ( @xmath107 ) and correct for the limited sky coverage of the latter ( @xmath108 ) , we would arrive at @xmath109  a factor of 20 higher than our estimate .",
    "the primary reason for this discrepancy is that the typical galaxy mass on our past light cone is _ lower _ than that of the milky way . in our simulations ,",
    "the mean galaxy mass in the observable universe ( without any weighting by the probability of this object to host tps ) is @xmath110 . after applying this correction , this observational method results in an estimate that lies within a factor of @xmath111 of our result .      a study such as this , which attempts to extrapolate results on the tp population from our local neighborhood to the whole universe obviously carries substantial uncertainties . in the following , we attempt to identify the factors that dominate the error budget , and to attach reasonable error bars to our main results .      the results presented in this paper rely heavily on semi - analytic models of galaxy formation to trace the formation of tps across space and time , but consistency checks using observational data can in some cases be carried out to test the robustness of our results .",
    "for instance , the mean age of tps is primarily determined by the cosmic star formation history , and while the star formation history predicted by galform is already in reasonable agreement with observations at @xmath112 , we can derive an alternative estimate by simply adopting the fitting function for the cosmic star formation history presented by while keeping the metallicity distribution from galform .",
    "the resulting average age differs from that presented in table  [ statistics_local ] by @xmath113 gyr and in table  [ statistics_highz ] by @xmath114 gyr .",
    "this approach also alters the total number of planets in the observable universe by @xmath115 . a comparison between our best estimate on the number of planets in the observable universe and that resulting from either the study , or from attaching the model - inferred number of planets per galaxy to galaxy counts in deep fields ( section  [ comparison ] ) , suggests consistency to within a factor of a few .",
    "we therefore adopt a conservative 0.5 dex uncertainty on all estimates of planet numbers in tables  [ statistics_local ] and [ statistics_highz ] .",
    "we take the outcome of the minor age offsets seen when compared to the results of in section  [ comparison ] to reflect the likely age uncertainties stemming from systematic uncertainties in semi - analytic models and conservatively adopt a 0.05 dex error on all age estimates .",
    "uncertainties on the parameters of the adopted cosmological model ( within the framework of @xmath67cdm cosmology ) primarily translate into an uncertainty on the age of the universe as a function of redshift and on the calculation of cosmological volumes in our analysis , thereby shifting the age scale for the cosmic population of tps and the planet counts .",
    "however , variations in @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 at the level motivated by the differences between the parameter sets favored by the recent wmap-9 @xcite and planck @xcite surveys have a relatively small impact on our results , amounting to age uncertainties of @xmath119 gyr and @xmath113 dex uncertainties in planet counts .",
    "a somewhat larger uncertainty comes from the fact that the galaxy catalogs originally generated by galform @xcite were based on the @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 km s@xmath71 mpc@xmath71 version of the @xmath67cdm cosmology , with @xmath123 ( a somewhat higher power spectrum normalization than favored by the @xcite ) , whereas the galacticus catalogs were originally based on @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 km s@xmath71 mpc@xmath71 , @xmath127 .",
    "however , the shift in the age - redshift relation resulting from these slight inconsistencies remains at the @xmath128 gyr level .",
    "other effects on the predicted galaxy population are degenerate with the many assumptions going into the semi - analytic machinery ( e.g. chemical yields , the progenitors mass limits for different kinds of supernovae ) , giving errorbars on planet counts that are likely to be captured by the 0.5 dex uncertainty we argue for in section  [ uncertainties : galaxy formation ] .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the assumption that the fraction of fgkm stars can be estimated using the @xcite universal stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . to assess how this affects our estimates of the number of tps",
    ", we have recomputed the planet formation history assuming the @xcite instead of the @xcite imf when estimating the fraction of fgk and m stars forming within each age bin of the simulated galaxies .",
    "both of these imfs predict that @xmath60 of all stars in the 0.08120 @xmath59 are born in the m dwarf mass regime ( here 0.08@xmath129 ) whereas @xmath2 are born in the mass range of fgk stars ( here 0.6@xmath130 ) .",
    "consequently , the predicted difference in tp statistics is very small  at the 0.02 dex level for number statistics and 0.01 dex for age estimates .",
    "however , the possibility that the stellar imf may be a function of both time and environment has been raised ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this could introduce uncertainties significantly larger than the ones considered here .",
    "the occurrence rates of tps at low metallicities are admittedly highly uncertain , but as argued in section  [ local ] , our results are remarkably robust to the reasonable adjustments of the planet occurrence recipe at the low metallicity end , simply because of the insignficant fraction of stars at such low metallicities . adopting the minimum metallicity for",
    "the formation of low - mass planets ( including the tps discussed here ) of [ fe / h ] @xmath131 advocated by would affect the number estimates at the sub - percent level . by assuming a step function similar to that of @xcite with a steep drop to zero probability for forming terrestrial planets at [ fe / h]@xmath132",
    ", we decrease the total number of terrestrial planets on our past light - cone by @xmath133 . on the other hand ,",
    "in a scenario where terrestrial planet formation has no metallicity dependency at all and we let the occurrence of terrestrial planets be constant at the low - metallicity end , we obtain an increment of terrestrial planets by @xmath134 .",
    "the possibility that tps may reform in the wake of migrating jupiters may boost the fraction of tps somewhat , but according to our estimates ( tables [ statistics_local ] and [ statistics_highz ] ) , this only affects the total population of tps at the @xmath2 level for fgk hosts and at the @xmath1352 % level for m dwarf hosts .",
    "when it comes to the fraction of tps in the circumstellar habitable zone , the uncertainties become much larger , since the observational occurrence rate of such planets around fgk stars alone is uncertain by almost an order of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the the habitability of both m - dwarfs and super - earths are debatable .",
    "based on the considerations above , we adopt an error of @xmath136 dex on our age estimates ( e.g. average tp age @xmath137 gyr for @xmath54 and @xmath5 gyr for our past light cone ) and an error on the total number of tps of 0.5 dex .",
    "this does not , however , include uncertainties related to potential variations of the shape / slope of the stellar initial mass function at the low - mass end with time and/or environment , since such variations remain poorly constrained and could have a very large impact on the number of m dwarfs .",
    "our model for cosmic planet formation indicates that :    * the average age of tps orbiting fgk stars in the local volume is @xmath138 gyr , whereas the corresponding value for tps orbiting m dwarfs is @xmath139 gyr .",
    "the difference is primarily due to the limited lifetimes of fgk stars compared to the current age of the universe .",
    "the average ages of tps ( around both fgk and m - type stars ) in the whole observable universe ( on our past light cone ) is @xmath5 gyr .",
    "the lower age compared to the local volume stems from the lookback - time effect , in which distant regions of the universe are seen at an earlier cosmic epochs . * while the median tp in the local universe is sitting in a galaxy of mass comparable to that of the milky way , the median tp on our past light cone is sitting in a galaxy with mass a factor of @xmath61 lower . * the number of tps per unit stellar mass at @xmath50 remains almost constant ( to within @xmath140 ) for galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath141@xmath142 . as a result",
    ", large satellite galaxies like the lmc are expected not to be depleted in tps . based on the observed mass - metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies and the recipe for metallicity - dependent tp formation adopted in this work",
    ", significant tp depletion is not expected to set in until @xmath143 , which is below the resolution limit of our simulations . *",
    "the total number of tps in a milky way - mass galaxy at @xmath54 is @xmath144 for tps around fgk stars and @xmath145 for tps around m dwarfs .",
    "* the numbers of tps in the whole observable universe are @xmath146 ( fgk hosts ) and @xmath147 ( m dwarf hosts ) .",
    "* there are conservatively @xmath90 habitable tps around fgk stars per unit total stellar population mass ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath148 habitable tps around fgk stars in the observable universe * about @xmath2 of the tps in the local universe are orbiting stars at metallicities lower or higher than those for which such planets have so far been detected . the corresponding fraction for the whole observable universe",
    "is estimated at @xmath149 * our model suggests that the typical tp in the local universe is not sitting in a disk - dominated system like the milky way , but in a spheroid - dominated galaxy  with about 1/2 of the local tp population in ellipticals .",
    "this leads to a mild violation of the copernican / mediocrity principle once habitability considerations related to supernova sterilization @xcite are factored in .",
    "since the @xcite predicts much better conditions for life on planets in massive ellipticals compared to actively star - forming systems like the milky way , the distribution of habitable tps would become biased in favour of ellipticals and make the earth an outlier in the distribution of tp across the current galaxy population .",
    "* only a small fraction ( @xmath150 ) of the tps on our past light cone are at redshifts @xmath151 , and when considering the subset of these planets older than earth , this redshift limit drops to @xmath152 . under the assumption that the emergence of intelligent life is tied to the formation of tps , the prospects of extragalactic seti efforts",
