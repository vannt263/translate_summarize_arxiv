    "we should use phenomenologic models on account of absent total theory of qcd .",
    "mp is begun at high energy . among of all producing particles we can observe a lot of hadrons .",
    "so , number of producing particles can be 50 and more in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite .",
    "on one hand we want to know high energy physics , but on the other hand the increase of the inelastic channels is making difficulty in the description of this process with customary methods by using of the diagram technics .",
    "we have similarly situation as we had at the time of developing the thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
    "the total analysis of mp process is very difficult .",
    "the consideration of such reactions begins from the analysis of behavior of charge multiplicity .",
    "* definition * : multplicity is the number of secondaries * n * in process mp : @xmath1 * definition * : multiplicity distribution ( md ) @xmath2 is the ratio cross - sections @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xmath5 this quantity has such sense : the probability of producing of @xmath6 charge particles in process ( [ 1 ] ) .    the description mp with using statistical methods is based on a lot of particles in this process .",
    "we can construct common quantities like mean values , moments of md , correlations and so on .",
    "the history of study mp is very interesting .",
    "it connects on one hand with the developing theory and on the other hand with increase energy of accelerators .",
    "we have stopped on the studing mp in @xmath0 - annihilation at high energy . at accordance with theory of strong interactions",
    "qcd this mp can be realize through the production of @xmath7 or @xmath8boson into two quarks : @xmath9    we can analyze the general features of hadronic decays up to the highest available center - of - mass  ( c.m . ) energies . in the last years lep produced @xmath0  -collisions of c.m .",
    "energies at 172 , 183 and 189 gev .",
    "the charge particle multiplicity can be more than 60 @xcite .",
    "qcd can describe process of fission partons ( quarks and gluons ) at high energy , because the strong coupling @xmath10 is small at that energy .",
    "this stage can be called as the stage of cascade . after fission , when partons have not high energy , they must change into hadrons , which we can observe . on this stage",
    "we should nt apply qcd , because @xmath10 is not small .",
    "phenomenological models are used for description of hadronization ( transformation partons ( quarks and gluons ) into hadrons ) .",
    "it is expected on the stage quark - gluon cascade perturbative qcd will be applied .",
    "certain features of the predictions at the parton level are expected to be insensitive to details of the hadronization mechanism .",
    "they can be tested directly by using hadron distributions @xcite .",
    "the hadronization models are more phenomenological and are built on the experience gained from the study of low@xmath11 hadron collisions .",
    "it is proposed to use two stage model  ( tsm ) @xcite for description md and other characteristics of @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "it is usually considered that the producing of hadrons from partons is universal one .",
    "we can use these md for calculation factorial and cumulant factorial moments and oscillations of their ratio and so on .",
    "investigation of mp led to discovery of jets .",
    "jets phenomena can be studied in all processes , where energetic partons are produced .",
    "the most common ones are in @xmath0 annihilation , deep inelastic scattering of @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 on nucleons and hadron- hadrons scattering , involving high-@xmath15 particles in final state .",
    "the @xmath0reaction is simple for analysis , as the produced state is pure @xmath16 .",
    "it is usually difficult to determine the quark species on event - by - event basis .",
    "the experimental results are averaged over the quark type . because of confinement the produced quark and gluons fragment into jets of observable hadrons .",
    "parton spectra in qcd quark and gluon jets have been studied by konishi  k. , ukawa  a. and veneciano  g.@xcite .",

    "giovannini proposed to interpret the natural qcd evolution parameter as the thickness of the jets and their development through subnuclear matter as markov process .",
    "the markov nature of elementary process ( `` gluon fission '' , `` quark bremsstrahlung '' and `` quark - pair creation '' ) leads to unsuspected properties of qcd jets .",

    "apparently that behavior of parameters of tsm is giving the reasonable picture of @xmath0 annihilation process .",
    "the average multiplicity of gluons @xmath106 formed on fission stage changes from 3 - 4 at 22 gev to 15 - 16 at 189 gev .",
    "this increase takes place with the growing energy , but at the some energy this value accepts a big one ( at 43.6 gev ) .    from qcd",

    "it changes unusually , it can be 5 - 6 or 8 - 15 at different energies , so it equal about 9 at 172 gev , but equal 54.6 at 183 and again 11 at 189 gev .",
    "after that analysis we can say about the existing some special energies when process hadronization changes ( at those energies value of @xmath111 is changed unconsiderably ) .    at the same time",
    "the parameter of hadronization @xmath108 ( mean number of hadrons formed from quark on stage of hadronization ) discovers insignificant growth with increasing of energy .",
    "it is changed from 3 - 4 at 22  gev up 4 - 5 at 172 - 189 gev .",
    "the existing models give quantity @xmath112 equal two ( it is observed really at energies lower than 40 gev ) .",
    "such behavior of parameter may be connected with the growth of spectrum of mass hadron states ( appearance of new mass states with increase of energy ) .",
    "it is interesting that the ratio @xmath113 ( the parameter of pbd ) is approximately regularity and is equal to @xmath114 .",
    "it should mark breaking such behavior at some energies ( 43.6 , 183 gev ) again .",
    "parameter @xmath110 is stayed approximately constant and equal to 0.2 in order case and become smaller than 0.1 at special cases ( 43.6 and 183 gev ) .",
    "the number of hadrons are produced from quark jet on the stage of hadronization is more than from gluon jet .",
