    "the les houches summer school was witness of how far quantum physics with atoms has already been advanced . while the non - classical aspects of quantum physics  such as mesoscopic superpositions or entanglement  require us to rethink our notions of reality , locality , logic , or space - time , they have also led to emerging technologies around computation , simulation , metrology , or sensing .",
    "our present contribution adds to both lines of research : we discuss how to visualize quantum mechanics in experiments with bodies of increasing mass and complexity , and we demonstrate how quantum interference can enhance molecule metrology and provide a tool for physical chemistry and biomolecular physics .",
    "several quantum dualities can be illustrated in such experiments , including the duality of _ determinism and randomness _ , of _ wave and particle _ , or the _ mutual uncertainty _ of conjugate variables .",
    "richard feynman once pointed out that all these characteristics can be found in a single demonstration @xcite , the double slit experiment with massive particles .",
    "the discrete , local particle nature appears in the detection process , while the indistinguishability of alternative paths through the experiment  the delocalized wave nature  explains the observed interference pattern .",
    "this is why feynman considered the double slit experiment to have `` in it the heart of quantum mechanics'' , containing its `` only mystery '' .    today",
    ", we might interject that an important aspect of quantum physics was missing , namely _ entanglement _ as the fundamental non - separability of two or more quantum systems . however , entanglement is not foreign to matter - wave physics .",
    "it appears in the form of mode entanglement and more relevantly in the form of quantum decoherence  which is even useful as a resource for molecule metrology .",
    "double- and multi - slit diffraction experiments with massive matter have been realized with electrons  @xcite , neutrons  @xcite , atoms  @xcite and their clusters @xcite , as well as small @xcite and large molecules @xcite .",
    "the combination of several diffraction elements into full matter - wave interferometers allowed accessing states of increasing macroscopicity : nowadays , it is possible to delocalize individual atoms on the half - meter scale @xcite and to demonstrate spatial superposition states from single electrons @xcite up to organic molecules exceeding @xmath0  amu  @xcite .",
    "all studies together already span a factor of @xmath1 in mass and are still fully consistent with schrdinger s quantum mechanics , as developed 90 years ago  @xcite .    in our present lecture",
    "we report on explorations of quantum physics with strongly bound , warm objects of high internal complexity .",
    "we study matter - wave interference of organic nanomatter that may bind dozens or beyond a thousand atoms into one single quantum object  @xcite .",
    "such experiments aim at pushing quantum physics towards two complementary frontiers : high mass and high complexity ; gravity and life .",
    "both frontiers offer research questions and opportunities for several decades to come .",
    "a number of reviews have already been written about the expected or speculative modifications of matter - wave physics at high mass @xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on the second aspect as a guideline to discuss and develop new techniques for quantum optics with molecules of biological interest .",
    "this is driven by five complementary goals :    [ [ curiosity ] ] curiosity + + + + + + + + +    in our daily lives one often tends to make qualitative distinctions between inorganic and organic matter , the inanimate and the animate world or even non - conscious objects and conscious beings .",
    "is there any fundamental limit or is it a distinction of complexity only ? can we still delocalize peptides , proteins , dna , viruses or cells ? this question has triggered a long - term journey , on a mass and time scale comparable with testing the gravitational limits of quantum physics .",
    "[ [ nanotechnology ] ] nanotechnology + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it has been traditionally difficult to prepare neutral beams of size - selected massive particles in the mass range of @xmath2  amu .",
    "cluster aggregation sources deliver intense beams of particles , but often the signal is distributed over many mass peaks . in contrast to that , life defines and selects the size and shape of biomolecules by their functionality .",
    "can we exploit this nature - made nanotechnology for quantum experiments , even if we do not ask any biological question ?",
    "biomolecules are fragile and not easy to volatilize , but progress is being made and some of it is reported here .",
    "[ [ complexity ] ] complexity + + + + + + + + + +    throughout recent years , we have witnessed enormous progress in the handling of few - particle quantum systems and in obtaining control over millions of quantum degenerate ultra - cold atoms , which may be as cold as a few picokelvin .",
    "complementary to that we accept the challenge of exploring quantum physics in a complexity range that is closer to our daily lives , with molecules composed of many hundreds of _ covalently _ bound atoms .",
    "because of their complexity , one can assign an internal temperature to macromolecules , even when they are prepared in spatial schrdinger cat states .",
    "we find that the de broglie wavelength of macromolecules can stay coherent over many milliseconds even when the internal temperatures exceed several hundred kelvins .",
    "[ [ decoherence ] ] decoherence + + + + + + + + + + +    with increasing complexity decoherence becomes an important agent in the game .",
    "the rich internal arrangement , in particular of biomolecules like proteins with their different structure levels  from primary to even quarternary structure  opens interaction channels with their environment that do not exist for electrons , neutrons , atoms or dielectric nanoparticles .",
    "[ [ metrology ] ] metrology + + + + + + + + +    the high sensitivity of macromolecules to external perturbations is both a curse and a blessing : it complicates attempts to prepare pure quantum states but it enables new ways of sensitively measuring molecular properties  by monitoring their matter - wave fringe shifts in the presence of external forces .",
    "such measurements build on the same principles as modern atom gravimeters and rotation sensors .",
    "while molecule interferometers will not compete with atom sensors as inertial sensors , their unique potential is rooted in their capability to act universally on a variety of particle classes and to expose them to external fields  as a unique test bed for physical chemistry and biomolecular physics , with the potential of becoming a viable technology .    in these lecture notes , we will present a tutorial introduction to molecular quantum physics , focusing on the coherent state preparation , on the diversity of diffraction techniques for complex molecules , on methods how to exploit quantum interference for obtaining molecular spectra and examples of challenges in preparing and detecting neutral biomolecular beams for quantum experiments .",
    "in this lecture we are focusing on quantum aspects of the center - of - mass motion of complex molecules , i.e.  on the coherent splitting of their de broglie wave fronts , their recombination and interference . in our experiments ,",
    "de broglie wavelengths range between @xmath3  m , which is typically @xmath4 times smaller than the size of the molecule itself and comparable to the shortest wavelengths in high - resolution transmission electron microscopy . for particles lighter than about 1000  amu",
    ", it is often possible to sublimate or evaporate them in thermal knudsen cells .",
    "this even holds for a sizable set of biomolecules such as nucleobases , vitamins , antibiotics , vanillin , caffeine and various other compounds .",
    "thermal beams have therefore proven useful for many of our quantum interference studies so far .    in molecular beams of small divergence  even in near - field interferometers the molecular beam",
    "is typically constrained to a divergence angle of 1  mrad  we can distinguish longitudinal and transverse coherence , which provide a measure for the interference capability of the emerging molecules .",
    "it is determined by the spectral and geometric properties of the source .    _",
    "longitudinal coherence , _ as in light optics , is determined by the spectral purity of the source .",
    "a practical value is @xmath5 , defined by the relative spread @xmath6 of de broglie wavelengths @xmath7 .",
    "it remains constant with distance from the source but can be improved by spectral filtering , i.e.  velocity selection . in thermal sources",
    "this value can be as short as @xmath8 , still much smaller than the molecule itself .",
    "again , this does not prevent successful interference since we are only dealing with the description of the center - of - mass motion of a single particle .    _ transverse coherence",
    "_ is at the origin of the indistinguishability of different molecular paths through space .",
    "it can be estimated both from heisenberg s uncertainty principle in quantum physics and the van cittert - zernike theorem in optics .",
    "transverse coherence @xmath9 grows linearly with the distance from the source @xmath10 and inversely proportional with the source size @xmath11 .",
    "being based on a diffraction phenomenon , it increases with increasing de broglie wavelength .    while path - indistinguishability is a key condition for matter - wave interference",
    ", we may also ask whether there is any chance to establish two - particle interference , as in hanbury - brown - twiss experiments , which have already been realized for atoms  @xcite .",
    "this would require identity in all degrees of freedom .",
    "any @xmath12-atom system has @xmath13 mechanical degrees of freedom , in addition to electronic , fine , hyperfine and zeeman levels in a complex configuration space .",
    "large molecules have a conformational orientation , permanent and vibrationally - induced dipole moments , and may undergo conformation changes upon photo - absorption ( photo - isomerization ) .",
    "this is why macromolecule interferometry deals only with the superposition of single - particle wave functions .",
    "molecule lasers , in the spirit of successfully realized atom lasers  @xcite , would require sub - microkelvin - low temperatures in all degrees of freedom and even then a mechanism to ensure that all molecules end up in the same absolute energy minimum of the conformational landscape . while this feat has been achieved for diatomic molecules",
    " it remains an outstanding challenge for macromolecules .    in thermal sources",
    "the mechanical degrees of freedom are equilibrated with the source temperature in the range of @xmath14  k by collisions .",
    "however , as soon as the molecules leave the cell and enter high- or even ultra - high vacuum , these degrees of freedom are decoupled on the time scale of the interference experiments . in the absence of thermal emission processes",
    ", the micro - canonical temperature then determines the rotation and vibration of the molecule  and the exchange of energy between the vibrational modes on a picosecond time scale  but it remains decoupled from the center - of - mass - motion .",
    "since matter - wave physics requires only a well - defined center - of - mass state of an ensemble of molecules whose internal states are sufficiently similar , de broglie interference can actually be observed for surprisingly large composite objects .",
    "coherent beam splitters are the foundation of every interferometer .",
    "they divide , redirect and recombine the incident waves . in analogy to classical optics , we distinguish two species also in matter - wave interferometry :    _ wave front beam splitters _ modulate the incident wave front using a spatially periodic structure , i.e.  a diffraction grating , which may either modulate the matter - wave phase or amplitude .",
    "_ phase gratings _ for atoms or molecules can be realized by exploiting the dipole potential emerging from the interaction between the particle s polarizability and the electric field amplitude of a standing light - wave grating .",
    "_ absorptive gratings _ may for instance be built using nanomechanical masks or _",
    "photo - depletion _ mechanism such as single - photon - ionization , 2-photon ionization , or photo - fragmentation in the anti - node of a standing light field .",
    "_ amplitude beam splitters _ , such as ramsey - bord  @xcite or raman beam splitters  @xcite do not realize stationary gratings in real space , but create entanglement between the internal atomic state and the external center - of - mass motion during the coherent interaction between the atom and one or two laser beams .",
    "we will see further below , that even in the absence of any coherent cycling as in atoms , single - photon absorption can contribute to the beam splitting process of hot molecules  @xcite .    here",
    "we review the concepts of beam splitters for complex molecules and discuss the dephasing mechanisms that emerge in particular in experiments with biomolecules , which are typically polar .",
    "first demonstrations of matter - wave physics with electrons  @xcite , atoms , and diatomic molecules  @xcite were done using reflective diffraction at clean crystal surfaces . with the advent of nanotechnologies ,",
    "free - standing nanomechanical transmission gratings were realized for electrons  @xcite , atoms  @xcite , and molecules  @xcite .",
    "such beam splitters are open masks that remove portions of the incident wave front by absorption or scattering .",
    "the spatially periodic confinement of the wave function in the slit openings leads to a spread of the transversal momentum behind the mask , in accordance with heisenberg s uncertainty principle and diffraction rules as known from wave optics .",
    "in contrast to light optics , the matter - wave transmission function @xmath15 is , however , not described by a binary filter @xmath16 alone , but also by the attractive interaction between the particles and the grating walls .    in the simplest case , we can treat the local interactions by considering particles that pass the grating wall in a straight line at distance @xmath17 . in the eikonal approximation",
    "we assume that this trajectory receives a transverse momentum kick which is soft enough that the related position shift will only become noticeable long after the grating . the interaction time is determined by the grating thickness @xmath18 and the molecular velocity @xmath19 along the forward direction . for thick gratings with openings as narrow as 50  nm it is also fair to assume that we can neglect retardation effects and treat the casimir - polder ( cp ) interaction in the near - field approximation , i.e.  using a van der waals scaling  @xcite :    @xmath20    the phase is determined by the molecular polarizability @xmath21 at all frequencies @xmath22 as well as by the dielectric function @xmath23 of the grating material , which is encoded in the surface reflection coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25    analysis of atomic diffraction patterns have yielded detailed information about atomic polarizabilities  @xcite and atom - surface interactions  @xcite .",
    "the description gets more demanding for molecules because of their complex internal structure and dynamics .",
    "they may have a permanent or even vibration - induced electric dipole moment and they may appear in a plethora of different conformational arrangements .",
    "hence , the attractive interaction to the wall depends on the molecular conformation and orientation inside the slit . at a source temperature of 500 - 1000",
    "k the molecules are highly excited and conformations can interconvert on the time scale of 1 - 10  picoseconds .",
    "this has to be compared to the molecular transit time through the grating , which amounts to 500  ps for @xmath26  m / s and @xmath27  nm .    hence , some the molecule - wall interaction can be described by an average value over molecular starting conditions and orientations . on the other hand , additional effects become relevant .",
    "vibrationally induced dipole moments , for instance , will increase the effective static polarizability  @xcite and the molecule may exchange excitations with the grating during the transit , leading to additional attractive or repulsive contributions to the potential  @xcite",
    ".    1.5  @xmath28 m .",
    "the resulting molecular beam is shaped in @xmath17- and @xmath29-direction before it reaches the grating after 1.55  m. the molecules illuminate 50 - 90 slits coherently .",
    "after additional 0.59  m they arrive at the quartz window of the detector .",
    "the quantum nature of the diffraction is revealed by analyzing the position distribution of the arriving particles , which we image using laser - induced fluorescence microscopy . ]",
    "the current setup of the far - field diffraction apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : farfield ]  @xcite .",
    "it is housed in a 2.14  m long vacuum chamber which is evacuated to a pressure below @xmath30  mbar .",
    "this is necessary to guarantee a collision - free flight of the molecules through the whole apparatus .",
    "the journey of the molecules begins in the source .",
    "they are deposited as a thin film on the inner surface of a vacuum window .",
    "when we focus a laser through the glass onto this film , we can evaporate the molecules thermally , which requires that the laser is resonant to an electronic transition of the molecule .",
    "the size of the laser spot defines the source size @xmath11 and is chosen as small as possible . for a spot size of @xmath31 m the transversal coherence of a particle with a wavelength of @xmath32  pm amounts to @xmath33 m at a distance @xmath34  m behind the source . for common gratings with a period of 100  nm",
    "this corresponds to a coherent illumination of 50 to 90 slits .",
    "after diffraction the molecules propagate for another 59  cm before they impinge on a thin quartz plate where they stick . in order to visualize the molecular pattern",
    "we need a method to read out the position of each particle with high accuracy .",
    "this is done by exciting the molecules electronically with laser light of suitable wavelength .",
    "once elevated to the excited state the molecules release the excess energy by the emission of a photon . for systems with a high fluorescence quantum yield this can be done many times before the molecule undergoes a photochemical reaction and is lost to the detection process .",
    "collecting a large number of photons allows for a very precise localization of every molecule down to 10  nm  @xcite .    a typical diffraction pattern is shown in fig .",

    "milled a mask using a focused gallium ion beam .",
    "we can extract various information from this image .",
    "first , we see high - contrast diffraction , up to the @xmath36 order .",
    "this proves the de broglie wave nature of pch@xmath35 molecules and corroborates the assumption that quantum mechanics in the translational degrees of freedom can persist , even if the internal degrees of freedom are highly excited .",
    "it also underlines that the rotational symmetry , which we assume for atoms and could also take for granted in earlier c@xmath37 diffraction experiments  @xcite is no prerequisite for the preparation of a clean translational quantum state .",
    "diffraction order .",
    "the population of high diffraction orders can be traced back to the casimir - polder interactions .",
    "the huge impact of these can be estimated when we compare the experimentally observed trace to a simulated one neglecting any attractive interactions ( c ) . ]",
    "the spacing of the diffraction orders increases from the top to the bottom of the image .",
    "since slower molecules fall further down in the gravitational potential of the earth before they reach the detector , their height encodes the molecular speed and de broglie wavelength .",
    "the highest diffraction orders on both sides of the image are separated by @xmath38 grating momenta . for comparison ,",
    "we calculate how many momenta of light would be necessary to realize the same separation for rubidium in a light grating at 780  nm .",
    "this yields    @xmath39    which compares very favorably with large momentum transfer beam splitters in state - of - the - art atom interferometry  @xcite .",
    "the enhanced polarizability of complex molecules may thus actually be useful for achieving a wide arm separation in nanomechanical beam splitters , since the population of high order diffraction orders is enhanced by the van der waals interaction .",
    "future efforts will still have to focus on improvements of the grating s coherence , i.e.  the regularity of the grating period to about 10  ppm over a few millimeters in a single mask as well as between different masks of the same fabrication batch . for 160  nm thick gratings",
    "written photo - lithographically this is already proven state of the art for more than two decades  @xcite .",
    "modern focused ion beam ( fib ) machines with interferometrically controlled translation stages are approaching a similar precision . a technological exploitation of such large momentum beam splitters requires either or blazed gratings or more intense molecular sources , since the signal is still distributed over many diffraction orders .",
    "a proper description of diffraction patterns also includes details of the grating bars , such as their geometry and wedge angles  @xcite and material inhomogeneities .",
    "the model can be based on a perturbative approach , where it is often sufficient to include only the scattering of a virtual photon from the molecule to the grating , and back . even scattering inside the material",
    "can be corrected for  @xcite .",
    "any remaining discrepancy between theory and experiment provides a hint on additional interactions , such as charges inside the thin dielectric membrane .",
    "our experiments with pch@xmath35 diffracted at a fib written grating showed an attractive potential 5 - 8 times stronger than expected based on the cp - interaction alone  @xcite .",
    "this effect was greatly reduced for masks that were generated in photo - lithography and reactive ion etching at low energies .    for non - polar molecules the near - field cp - force and the attraction between a neutral particle and a residual charge",
    "have the same distance scaling and can be hardly distinguished .",
    "however , for polar molecules the interaction with the grating depends on the orientation of the molecular rotation axis to the wall and to the electric dipole moment .",
    "this has clear consequences .    .",
    "]    it is of particular importance for the diffraction of biomolecules at nanomechanical masks .",
    "they are all equipped with functional groups such as oh , nh@xmath35 or cooh , which determine the interaction with their surroundings and are necessary for their biological function .",
    "hypericin , naturally occurring in the medicinal herb saint john s wort , acts as a neurotransmitter , antibiotic , and antiviral agent  @xcite .",
    "it serves here as an example of a polar biomolecule .",
    "figure  [ fig : hypericin ] shows its diffraction pattern at a carbon grating of 20  nm thickness .",
    "the diffraction peaks are less sharp than those of phthalocyanine in fig .",
    "[ fig : sin_diffraction ] , which we attribute to the permanent electric dipole moment of hypericin of about 4  debye . to elucidate the role of the molecular polarity ,",
    "we have compared the diffraction pattern of the non - polar tetraphenylporphyrin ( tpp ) and its polar derivative ( meo)tpp . both substances are close in mass and polarizability , but differ in their dipole moment because of the ococh@xmath40 group attached to one phenyl ring .",

    "the resistivity of amorphous carbon ( @xmath47  m ) is 20 orders of magnitude smaller than of silicon dioxide ( @xmath48  m ) .",
    "this readily explains why a carbon grating can be substantially less or more homogeneously charged and better suited for diffracting of polar molecules . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpp - meotpp ] their diffraction patterns are compared for two different gratings  @xcite , both milled by a focused ion beam , but into materials with greatly differing conductivity .",
    "while the carbon membrane is a weak electric conductor the silicon dioxide grating is an insulator .",
    "hence , charges buried inside the gratings are more likely to be neutralized inside the carbon layer than in silicon dioxide .",
    "the non - polar tpp shows high contrast interference at both materials .",
    "the polar ( meo)tpp , however , exhibits already a slightly blurry pattern behind the carbon grating and it is entirely washed out behind the silicon dioxide mask .",
    "not a single diffraction order can be resolved behind the insulating grating and slow molecules even seem to be deflected to beyond the detector area .",
    "this observation is attributed to the dynamics of the permanent electric dipole moment in an inhomogeneous electric field .",
    "in contrast to non - polar molecules , where the interaction is always attractive , polar molecules may experience attractive or repulsive forces depending on their orientation with respect to local charges which may implanted during focused ion beam writing in sio@xmath35 with a density up to @xmath49/@xmath50  @xcite .    in thermal beams , neither the initial orientation nor the rotational state",
    "are well controlled .",
    "furthermore , the electric field inside the dielectric can be stochastically distributed in amplitude and direction . in consequence ,",
    "each molecule will experience a different local force and we accumulate the incoherent sum of many coherent but shifted single - molecule diffraction patterns on the screen . even though there is no proper decoherence , path entanglement , or which - path information shared with the environment",
    ", the matter - wave contrast disappears because of this random phase averaging , due to the molecule - wall interaction .",
    "this is of particular importance for large polar biomolecules , such as for instance insulin which is known to have an electric dipole moment of 72  debye in solution  @xcite .",
    "however , even for non - polar molecules the cp - interaction influences the molecular diffraction pattern substantially , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sin_diffraction ] . the simplest approach to modeling",
    "this pattern is to encode the attractive interaction in an effective width of the single slit diffraction pattern , which defines the fringe envelope  @xcite . fitting this width allows extracting a qualitative measure for the path - integrated interaction strength . during the diffraction of pch@xmath35 at",
    "a 45  nm thick sin@xmath51 grating , for instance , the geometrical slit width of 50  nm appears reduced to an effective width of only 15  nm  @xcite .",
    "larger molecules with a higher polarizability will see a further reduced slit width and may eventually not even pass the grating any more .    for quantum experiments with massive particles",
    "it therefore appears essential to reduce the grating thickness  and thus the relevance of cp - potentials  to the thinnest conceivable value . in recent years ,",
    "2d - membranes have become available , that range in thickness between a few nanometers and a single atomic layer .",
    "our collaboration partners at tel aviv university made it possible to manufacture gratings with 100  nm period into such membranes with high quality  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ultrathindiffraction ] we show the diffraction patterns of pch@xmath35 behind several of these gratings .",
    "they all are about 1  nm thick and we observe a clear reduction of the cp - force compared to thicker masks .",
    "the smallest interaction is indeed observed for single layer graphene , which is only one carbon atom thin .",
    "however , even this ultimate nanomechanical element for molecular quantum optics exhibits an effective slit width of 35  nm , still 40 percent smaller than the geometrical opening .",
    "although the molecule spends only a few picoseconds",
    "inside the slit  the molecule is actually larger than the grating thickness ( ! )  it is still affected by the cp - interaction",
    ".        these experiments also allude to a discussion between nils bohr and albert einstein , on whether information about the path of a particle through a double slit can be retrieved by monitoring the recoil of the mask .",
    "if this were possible , this would destroy the diffraction pattern  @xcite .",
    "single layer graphene is about the lightest and thinnest durable mechanical mask one can think of , making it a valid candidate for testing this question .",
    "according to bohr the diffraction remains unnoticed and coherence maintained when the momentum transfer between molecule and mask is smaller than the intrinsic momentum uncertainty of the grating itself .",
    "the following back - of - the envelope estimate may elucidate this relation : the momentum uncertainty for the matter - wave diffracted at a rectangular slit is  @xcite : @xmath52 .",
    "this relation looks different from the one typically shown in textbooks , since we define @xmath53 as the experimentally observable full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the diffraction envelope and @xmath54 as geometrical width of a single diffraction slit . for the grating we take @xmath55 , where the uncertainties are usually taken to be the 1/@xmath56 values of a gaussian distribution in position and momentum .",
    "the threshold for coherent diffraction is @xmath57 .",
    "as soon as @xmath53 gets larger than @xmath58 coherent diffraction vanishes .",
    "when we take the minimal uncertainty in momentum of the grating @xmath59 and insert this into the other equation , we get    @xmath60    this is the lower boundary for the geometrical opening of the grating at which diffraction is still coherent",

    ", van der waals forces would extract the molecules from the beam , anyhow .",
    "in contrast to material gratings , which inevitably introduce an orientation - dependent phase shift , optical beam splitters can act on a large variety of particles , even when they are charged or exhibit an electric or magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the internal complexity of large molecules renders coherent cycling between the ground and the excited states difficult and excludes ramsey - bord or raman interferometers .",
    "we can , however , exploit all optical processes that induce a spatially periodic phase shift or entail a spatially periodic depletion of the molecular beam .",
    "the diffraction at a thin standing light wave has entered the literature already in 1933 , when piotr kapitza and paul dirac suggested electron reflection at an optical bragg grating  @xcite .",
    "the original kapitza - dirac ( kd ) effect is based on the ponderomotive potential that the electron experiences in the presence of a light beam  @xcite .",

    "[ eqn : phaseshift ] explains why this is no longer the case for phase gratings : only at low laser power or small molecular polarizability the sum over the bessel functions will mimic the far - field diffraction pattern of an absorptive grating , like the graphene nanomasks in section  [ sec : farfield ] . at high laser power , the central peak can be suppressed .",
    "beam splitters based on wave front division in a phase grating are an interesting option for composite particles , but the observation of wave interference in the far - field requires the collimation angle to be smaller than the diffraction angle . with decreasing de broglie wavelength , we therefore need to collimate the molecular beam increasingly well .",

    "a solution to this problem is near - field interferometry which allows working with spatially incoherent and wide particle beams .",

    "[ tbh ]     however , it soon became clear that the dispersive forces of massive organic molecules near mechanical walls would render the source requirements exigent , in particular with regard to velocity selectivity  @xcite .",
    "the solution to this challenge was to combine an absorptive grating with a phase grating and again an absorptive grating .",
    "if the molecular beam were spatially coherent , right from the source , the first grating could also be a phase grating with 100% transmission .",
    "this has been demonstrated for cold atoms  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",

    "diffraction at the central optical grating g2 then leads to the lens - less formation of a grating self - image , which can only be explained by near - field wave interference .",

    "the photon energy is therefore dominantly deposited in the matrix molecules which evaporate and entrain the analyte particles .",
    "since the matrix consists of proton donors it can also protonate and charge the analyte molecules .",
    "maldi typically launches singly charged biomolecules of either polarity in high vacuum , at moderate repetition rate and well suited for short experiments with small samples .",
    "in contrast to that , electrospray ionization is better suited for preparing steady continuous beams .        in electrospray ionization analyte molecules",
    "are filled into a narrow capillary , which is placed at a distance to an opening in the vacuum machine . at high electric fields , the liquid forms a cone which breaks into a filament and further into droplets which partially dry in air and also eject further droplets , because of the growing imbalance between coulomb repulsion and surface tension .",
    "a series of emission and evaporation processes leads finally to the release of individual , unsolvated analyte molecules .",
    "hence , the mass - to - charge ratio in polypeptides and proteins usually ranges between 1000 - 2000  amu / e in esi experiments .",
    "this is ideal for mass analysis in commercial quadrupole mass filters , but less advantageous for quantum experiments with neutral beams .",
    "charge exchange techniques from aerosol science can reduce the charge per particle by collisions in bi - polar air @xcite before they are transferred into high vacuum through ion guides and a differential pumping system .",
    "the molecules are mass - selected in a quadrupole mass filter in high vacuum .",
    "a subsequent hexapole guide allows collisions with cryogenically cold ( typically 60  k ) neutral buffer gas ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : esi ] ) .",
    "esi works over a very wide mass scale , from amino acids to viruses .",
    "however , the manipulation , control and mass spectrometry needs to be adapted for a specific mass scale .",
    "the setup in vienna is currently optimized for a maximal mass - to - charge ratio of up to 30000  amu / e . the extraction of neutral particles by photo - depletion processes is an open challenge still under investigation  @xcite .",
    "quantum optics with complex molecules has many far - reaching goals and faces a plethora of intriguing challenges .",
    "the field shares many concepts and solutions with atom interferometry and atom optics , however , enriched by the complexity of strongly bound systems , composed of 1000 atoms at present and possibly 100000 atoms in the future .",
    "the branch of organic and biomolecular interferometry has been developing with new ideas for novel quantum and decoherence experiments , but also new hope for a radically different way of measuring biomolecular matter under controlled conditions .",
    "these experiments aim at single - molecule sensitivity , either isolated from the surroundings or hydrated with a controlled number of water molecules and also in interaction with single photons .",
    "matter - wave physics with the building blocks of life is still a young research activity which profits from vigorous and fruitful interactions with researchers in physical chemistry , computational and biochemistry , nanoimaging and nanotechnology .",
    "many quantum manipulation and interference techniques have already been developed .",
    "further success is strongly tied with rapid development in molecular beam technologies .",
    "this summary encompasses a selection of years of fruitful research in the quantum nanophysics group in vienna , including present and former members , as well as our collaboration partners around ori cheshnovsky ( tel aviv university , nanofabrication and optical imaging ) , klaus hornberger , benjamin stickler , and stefan nimmrichter ( university of duisburg - essen , quantum theory ) , stefan scheel ( university of rostock , casimir - polder theory ) , and marcel mayor and valentin khler ( university of basel , chemical synthesis and functionalization ) .",
    "we thank them all for their inspiring and important input over many years that is only partially reflected in this lecture .",
    "ma is grateful to anton zeilinger ( university of vienna ) for many years of fruitful collaboration on macromolecule interferometry .",
    "we thank in particular stefan gerlich , lukas mairhofer , and joe cotter for their contributions to kdtli interferometry and maxime debiossac and moritz kriegleder for recording the mass spectrum of myoglobin .",
    "we are grateful to financial support through the european research council project 320694 , the european commission within project 304886 as well as the austrian science funds project w1210 - 3 .",
