    "graphene resounds throughout the land @xcite .",
    "it is a single layer of @xmath0 hybridized carbon , has remarkable chemical stability and physical properties like that of a conductor with high charge carrier mobility .",
    "her polar sister , hexagonal boron nitride , has similar chemical stability , though is an insulator .",
    "single layer hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath2-bn ) and graphene ( @xmath3 ) also have great potential as templates for molecular self - assembly .",
    "the layers are grown and supported on transition metal surfaces @xcite . here",
    "we focus on _ corrugated _ single layers .",
    "the corrugation is a vertical deformation of the surface that can be described as a static distortion wave .",
    "the physical origin of these distortions are the mismatch and the concomitant epitaxial stress between the overlayer and the substrate , where the anisotropic bonding or lock in energy imposes this kind of dislocations .",
    "the much softer out of plane modulus of the @xmath0 layers causes a large vertical distortion compared to the in - plane straining .",
    "the wavelengths , or superlattice constants , of these static distortion waves can be calculated from the lattice mismatch between the overlayer and the substrate . for rhodium and ruthenium",
    "it is in the order of 3 nm and the corrugation , or peak to peak amplitude ( between 0.05 and 0.15 nm ) are the essential features and determine the template function .",
    "it has been shown that the corrugation imposes _ lateral _ electric fields , which can guide charged or polarizable media @xcite .",
    "this property leads to 3 bond hierarchy levels .",
    "the @xmath4-bonds , in the order of 10 ev provide chemical stability and robustness , the @xmath5-bonds , in the order of 1 ev , the adsorption energies , and the @xmath6-bonds(named after the label @xmath6 for the polarizability @xmath6 ) , in the order of 100 mev , are responsible for the lateral trapping of molecules @xcite .",
    "this article covers the basic ingredients of the geometric structure of lattice mismatched @xmath0 layers on transition metals , their potential as `` nano - laboratories '' , where an example of the behavior of nano - ice clusters as a function of temperature is given .",
    "finally , the potential of such superstructures as quantum dot arrays is outlined .",
    "it is shown that such quantum dots can be addressed by electroluminescence , where the yield varies one order of magnitude within the 3 nm unit cell of @xmath2-bn / rh(111 ) .",
    "when the lattice mismatch @xmath7 of an overlayer with the substrate exceeds a critical value , superstructures with large lattice constants are formed . for parallel epitaxy",
    "we write : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the overlayer and the substrate lattice constants , respectively . in this notation",
    "positive ( negative ) @xmath7 indicate compressive ( tensile ) stress in the overlayer , and vice versa . for most transition metal substrates with @xmath2-bn or @xmath3",
    "overlayers the mismatch is negative , i.e. tensile stress in the overlayer prevails .",
    "if the lattice of the overlayer and the substrate are rigid and parallel , the superstructure lattice constant gets @xmath11 , where @xmath9 is the 1@xmath121 lattice constant of @xmath2-bn or graphene ( @xmath1 0.25 nm ) . besides the mismatch ,",
    "the balance between the lock in energy and the strain energy is decisive for the resulting morphology of the systems .",
    "lock in energy has to be paid when the over - layer atoms are moved parallel to the surface , away from the lowest energy sites . for systems with small lock in energy",
    "compared to the strain energy , we expect flat floating layers , reminiscent to incommensurate moir patterns without a lock in to a high symmetry direction of the substrate . such examples of moir s are e.g. @xmath2-bn / pd(111)@xcite or @xmath3/ir(111 ) @xcite . however , if the unit cells of the superstructure contain regions with distinct electronic structure , as it is e.g. the case for @xmath2-bn / rh(111 ) @xcite or @xmath3/ru(0001 ) @xcite , it is appropriate to use a term distinct from moir , like it is nanomesh. preobrajenski et al . were the first who also used the term nanomesh for @xmath3-systems where two distinct carbon core levels have been found @xcite .",
    "the energy difference in the core level binding energies was assigned to the corrugation , i.e. different elevations or distances of the @xmath0 layers from the substrate . for a superstructure of a honeycomb lattice of @xmath0 hybridized layers on a hexagonal closed packed substrate as rh(111 ) or ru(0001 ) , it is convenient to describe different locations along the notation used by auwrter and grad et al . @xcite .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is made of a base with two atoms ( b , n ) or ( c@xmath13,c@xmath14 ) .",
    "these atoms may sit on @xmath15 , on @xmath16 or on @xmath17 sites within the substrate unit cell ( see figure [ ftopfcchcp ] ) .",
    "the @xmath15 site is occupied if an atom of the honeycomb sits on top of a substrate atom , below the @xmath16 hollow site no atom is found in the second substrate layer , while there is one for the @xmath17 hollow site .",
    ", @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the dashed line shows the ( 1@xmath121 ) unit cell .",
    "after ref .",
    "@xcite ]    we note that for single domain @xmath2-bn structures only three of the six combinations of the honeycomb base like ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) , ( @xmath17,@xmath15 ) , ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) or ( @xmath16,@xmath15 ) , ( @xmath15,@xmath17 ) , ( @xmath17,@xmath16 ) occur . for graphene , where the two carbon atoms are distinct by their coordination to the substrate only , no such domains are expected .",
    "when the honeycomb is mismatched , i.e. does not have the lattice constant of the substrate , the assignments ( b , n)=(@xmath16,@xmath15),(@xmath17,@xmath16 ) etc .",
    "are only approximately valid and we write e.g. ( c@xmath13,c@xmath14)@xmath1(@xmath15 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "with this scheme in mind we may understand the complementarity of mismatched @xmath2-bn and @xmath3 nanomeshes , where it is found that about one third of the super cell ( b , n)@xmath1(@xmath17,@xmath16 ) and ( c@xmath13,c@xmath18)@xmath1(@xmath17,@xmath16 ) do not bind to the substrate and consequently belong to the elevated regions .",
    "for @xmath2-bn there is also no bonding for boron on @xmath15 sites i.e. ( b , n)@xmath1(@xmath15,@xmath17 ) , and consequently two thirds of the mismatched @xmath2-bn layers are elevated and form the connected wire network .",
    "graphene is complementary i.e. the ( c@xmath13,c@xmath18)@xmath1(@xmath15,@xmath17 ) and the ( c@xmath13,c@xmath18)@xmath1(@xmath16,@xmath15 ) sites bind to the substrate and form a connected hexagonal valley network , with graphene in close contact to the substrate @xcite .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the substrate breaks the symmetry between the sublattice made of c@xmath13 and c@xmath14 atoms , respectively , and disables the formation of dirac cones , which are the attribute of freestanding graphene .",
    "for @xmath2-bn this symmetry breaking is intrinsic , since b and n are different and induce polarity with electron transfer to nitrogen .",
    "figure [ fstruct ] shows room temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) pictures of @xmath3/rh(111 ) and @xmath2-bn / rh(111 ) .",
    "the relief views in a ) and c ) are extracted by the wsxm scanning probe microscopy software @xcite from the scanning tunneling microscopy data in b ) @xmath2-bn / rh(111 ) and d ) @xmath3/rh(111 ) , respectively .",
    "clearly , the inverted topographies of the two layer systems can be seen .",
    "the @xmath2-bn / rh(111 ) nanomesh has a 12@xmath1212 periodicity where 13 bn units sit on 12 rh substrate units , which corresponds to a 3.2 nm superlattice constant @xcite .",
    "the labels for the two topographic elements are holes , pores , cavities or cells for the ( b , n)=(@xmath16,@xmath15 ) regions with close binding and wires for the ( b , n)=(@xmath17,@xmath16 ) & ( @xmath15,@xmath17 ) regions , which are elevated by about 0.1 nm . the @xmath3/rh(111 ) nanomesh has a periodicity of about 11@xmath1211 , where 12 @xmath3 units sit on 11 rh substrate units , which corresponds to a 2.9 nm superlattice constant @xcite .",
    "the slightly smaller unit cell is due to the smaller lattice constant of graphene compared to that of hexagonal boron nitride .",
    "the labels for the two topographic elements are mounds , hills or ripples for the ( @xmath19 , @xmath20)=(@xmath17,@xmath16 ) protrusions with loose binding and valleys for the ( @xmath19 , @xmath20)=(@xmath16,@xmath15 ) & ( @xmath15,@xmath17 ) regions , which are about 0.1 nm closer to the substrate . for the case of @xmath3/rh(111 ) we would like to mention a difference , compared to the related @xmath3/ru(0001 ) system .",
    "it can be seen that the strongest bonding does not coincide with the ( @xmath16,@xmath15 ) or ( @xmath15,@xmath17 ) sites but 3 small extra dips in the valleys where carbon atoms are closer to bridge sites are binding strongest to the substrate @xcite .",
    "this , compared to @xmath3/ru(0001 ) , new structural element might impose extra effects in the template function and should be further explored .",

    "these physically and electronically corrugated landscapes form templates for the self - assembly of molecular arrays as it was shown for @xmath2-bn nanomesh @xcite , @xmath3/rh(111 ) @xcite or @xmath3/ru(0001 ) @xcite .",
    "also it was demonstrated that these substrates may be used for the growth of metal nano - clusters @xcite .",
    "here we want to highlight the opportunity to use a template like the @xmath2-bn nanomesh as a nano - laboratory , where processes may be studied in a parallel fashion , i.e. in an ensemble , at the same time , under the same temperature and pressure conditions . for scanning probes this also comprises the added value that the data are recorded with the same tip .",
    "these features increase the data flux from the experiment by orders of magnitude .",
    "in particular we expect that e.g. the diversification in growth processes may be studied .",
    "this nano - laboratory assay allows , to study equilibrium as well as non equilibrium processes .",
    "if we want to lend a picture from biology the @xmath2-bn nanomesh can be considered as a `` cell culture '' , though at a 3 orders of magnitude smaller length scale . in order to illustrate the `` nano - laboratory ''",
    "we show data on the temperature evolution of water clusters in the @xmath2-bn nanomesh .",
    "recently it was shown that water self - assembles in the holes of @xmath2-bn nanomesh in forming ice nanoclusters containing about 40 water molecules .",
    "the clusters consist in a bilayer of ice , reminiscent to the basal plane of hexagonal ice , and display proton disorder that was accessed with tunneling barrier height measurements @xcite . in figure [ fice ] the development of the ice clusters as a function of temperature",
    "is shown , for 5 different temperatures , about 7 nanomesh `` cells '' with a diameter of 2 nm contain each one ice cluster .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the results for different temperatures do not show the same cells , because the thermal drift in the present set up during the warm up from 34 to 151 k does not yet allow to track individual cells .",
    "the superstructure periodicity does , however , allow an almost perfect drift correction at a given temperature .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the rims of the ice clusters have a distinct behavior with respect to the bulk .",
    "figure [ fice ] a ) shows the ordered ice clusters made by about 40 water molecules at 34 k. every second water molecule shows up as a protrusion inside the @xmath2-bn nanomesh . at 101 k the edge of the clusters start to display disorder ( figure [ fice ] b ) . further increase of the temperature induces an increase of the cluster height ( figure [ fice ] c ) and d ) ) and at 151 k the clusters sublimated ( figure [ fice ] e ) and bare nanomesh is observed .",
    "a quantum dot is a small physical object that is confined in 3 dimensions , where nuclei and atoms are the most prominent examples .",
    "the localization to a point implies the absence of dispersion of the electronic states .",
    "the size of a quantum dot determines the energy level spacing .",
    "if this spacing @xmath26 is compared to @xmath27 we get a measure for the temperature below which we expect the dots to behave like quantum objects , or above which the occupancy of different levels fluctuates .",
    "the rydberg energy ( 13.6 ev ) , which is the scale for the electronic level spacing in a coulomb potential of a proton is proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29=0.05 nm is the bohr radius .",
    "if we are interested in quantum dots that are operational at room temperature ( @xmath27=25 mev ) , this limits the size of quantum dots to below 500 @xmath30 .",
    "though , for practical purposes the level spacing should be at least one order of magnitude larger than @xmath27 and thus room temperature quantum dots should be smaller than 5 nm .",
    "the @xmath0 templates discussed in this paper do match this condition .",
    "indeed quantum dot behavior was found for graphene on ruthenium @xcite . for @xmath3/ru(0001 ) photoemission showed one set of of @xmath0 valence bands , while @xmath2-bn / ru(0001 ) and @xmath2-bn / rh(111 ) do show two @xmath0 valence band structures split by about 1 ev @xcite .",
    "the two band structure systems were assigned to the two regions within the super cells , where the corrugation of the @xmath2-bn imposed , a mainly electrostatically driven splitting @xcite .",
    "as expected this splitting is also observed with high resolution b 1s , c 1s and n 1s core level spectroscopies @xcite , and photoemissions from adsorbed xe @xcite .",
    "interestingly the valence band splitting was not observed for @xmath3/ru(0001 ) @xcite .",
    "the obvious difference between graphene and @xmath2-bn is that graphene on ruthenium has a fermi surface , while @xmath2-bn on ru(0001 ) @xcite or on rh(111 ) @xcite has not , may not explain this with a screening argument , since the c 1s core level is still split on @xmath3/ru(0001 ) @xcite .",
    "the seeming paradox can be resolved , when we assign to the hills in the @xmath3/ru(0001 ) superstructure an isolated , molecule like behavior , without dispersion , which qualifies them as quantum dots arranged on a hexagonal array with 3 nm spacing . for the case of the @xmath2-bn , the holes",
    "might also be identified as quantum dots , however , angular resolved photoemission shows dispersion of the @xmath2-bn valence bands , also for the bands assigned to the holes that are separated by the superlattice constant of 3 nm @xcite . a difference between the hills of @xmath3/ru(0001 ) and",
    "the holes of @xmath2-bn / ru(0001 ) is the fact that @xmath2-bn holes are in close contact to the substrate , while graphene hills are decoupled .",
    "this imposes a lateral vacuum tunneling barrier for electrons on the hills , while this barrier is much lower for the case of the @xmath2-bn holes that are in close proximity to the metal substrate .",
    "if the @xmath0 templates are decorated with molecules ( or clusters ) , the quantum dots change and the coupling between them will be affected .",
    "it will be interesting to further explore this coupling and to try to control it .",
    "electroluminescence could serve as a tool to access such information .",
    "with scanning tunneling microscopy induced electroluminescence , light emission can be probed as a function of the tunneling site with sub - wavelength resolution .",
    "as we show here it is one possible road to access single unit cells and is considered to be a realization of a nano - device , where it comes to the transport of information localized at the nanometer scale to the macroscopic millimeter scale .",
    "electroluminescence in scanning tunneling microscopy was pioneered by gimzewski et al .",
    "@xcite , and is a way to record inelastic scattering in tunneling junctions , where e.g. molecular vibrations may be resolved , if the wavelength of the emitted photons is measured @xcite .",
    "figure [ flumi ] shows the correlation between topography and light emission from @xmath2-bn nanomesh .",
    "light was collected by a lens system connecting the tunneling junction with a cooled red sensitive hamamatsu r5929 photomultiplier tube operating in the wavelength window between 300 and 850 nm .",
    "the tunneling voltage was set to -2.5 v ( tunneling electrons from the substrate to the tip ) and tungsten tips with a 80 nm gold coating were used . for isotropic emission into the @xmath31 half space above a surface ,",
    "the detection probability of a 2 ev photon is 0.4 % , and the dark count rate was about 25 counts / s .",
    "the photon map in figure [ flumi ] b ) and the corresponding cut in figure [ flumi ] c ) show strong electroluminescence from the nanomesh holes , which is more than one order of magnitude larger than that from the wires .",
    "though , the average quantum efficiency ( detected photons per scan line ) varies in the shown data by one order of magnitude .",
    "this variation must be ascribed to changes in the gold tip where plasmon excitations / deexcitations cause photon emission .",
    "the arrows on the right of figure [ flumi]a ) and b ) indicate three distinct tip changes @xmath32 .",
    "it can be seen that the topography image before change @xmath33 is inverted after change @xmath34 .",
    "the enhancement of the quantum efficiency at change @xmath35 does neither coincide with @xmath33 nor @xmath34 .",
    "however , the results suggest that the tunneling junction with the tip on top of a hole of the @xmath2-bn nanomesh imposes more inelastic scattering events on the tip . the high electron affinity and the concave form of the holes lets them act like a resonator cavity , where the electrons are focused on the tip , and where the probability for a plasmon excitation increases .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the inverse situation is observed for graphene on ru , where the poor electron affinity and the convexity of the hills defocus electrons in a tunneling junction with the tip on top of the hill @xcite .",
    "the data shown in figure [ flumi ] indicate that scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence can be used for the identification of sites within the 12@xmath1212 super cell of @xmath2-bn / rh(111 ) with sub - nanometer resolution .",
    "also the experiments indicate that the control of the tip parameters is crucial for a successful application of this effect .",
