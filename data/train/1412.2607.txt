    "dirac fermions emerge in solid state systems when the band structure is embedded with any two  component quantum degrees of freedom such as spin or pseudospin under specific symmetry considerations.@xcite in graphene , gapless dirac cones arise due to the sublattice symmetry of the honeycomb lattice when the sample dimension is reduced exactly to an atomically thin two - dimensional ( 2d ) sheet.@xcite in topological insulators , an ` inverted ' bulk bandgap , typically opened by spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , renders dirac excitations on the surface or boundary of the sample as long as time - reversal symmetry is held.@xcite some of these special conditions required for the formation of dirac fermions in graphene and topological insulators are lifted in the weyl semimetal framework . in the latter family , weyl cone",

    "the precise lattice symmetry and structural confinement play the central role to achieve high degree of phase coherence for the electron transport .    in this paper",
    ", we explore a different idea for the formation of bulk dirac cones and weyl orbital semimetals without the need of soc or structural confinement .",
    "we develop a generic low - energy theory for the weyl orbital semimetals for various combinations of different orbitals , such as even and odd orbitals pair or bonding and antibonding states or pair of even or pair of odd orbitals or two different basis of same orbital , in variety of 3d lattices . the key ingredient in our theory roots in finding the optimum conditions in which the two orbitals states commence inverted band structure , and at the same time their inter - orbital electron hoppings obtain an odd function of energy - momentum dispersion , such that its low - energy hamiltonian can be reduced to an effective  @xmath7 - type hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting 3d dirac or weyl nodes at the orbital degenerate points are protected by orbital symmetry . by using density functional theory ( dft ) , we predict four distinct classes of materials which exemplify different mechanisms for generating weyl orbital nodes .",
    "the predicted materials have orbital components stemming from the weakly correlated @xmath8 or @xmath9 orbitals , which , thereby , stipulates very high weyl fermion velocity . for bli ,",
    "our first - principle estimation of weyl fermion velocity is @xmath10 m / s , which is even larger than graphene .",

    "the first term is for intra - orbital hoppings which consists of only nearest neighbor hopping , and the second term is the chemical potential . for the inter - orbital hoppings , we consider both the nearest neighbor ( third term ) and the next - nearest neighbor hopping ( fourth term ) .",
    "this is because , for various orbital and lattice geometries , either of them can be the leading term , and can give rise to linear dispersion .",
    "the symmetry of the hamiltonian will remain unchanged when higher order hopping parameters are included as it will be evident later .",
    "since we are only interested in the inter - orbital hoppings which can give rise to linear dispersion , we restrict our discussion to the odd parity hopping between different orbitals . for this purpose",
    ", we have introduced an index @xmath15 which changes sign when the direction of hopping is reversed .",
    "this is the crucial part of our theory which can give imaginary hopping without soc . with a fourier transformation to the momentum space ,",
    "we obtain @xmath16 the first term in the above equation is the intra - orbital band dispersion for free fermions , while the second term consists of inter - orbital hopping integrals . without loosing generality ,",

    "the intra - orbital bands @xmath33 have parabolic dispersions , and the weyl nodes can appear at the loci of @xmath35 .",
    "this makes the dirac mass ( @xmath21 ) to vanish at a constant energy contour as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0](a ) , which occurs in materials due to band inversion , and thus it is parameter dependent .",
    "the remaining three @xmath9-vector components not only have to simultaneously vanish at discrete momenta on the same contour , but should also contain odd - parity inter - orbital hopping term and/or imaginary hopping term . under such circumstances ,",

    "the spinor basis for the weyl fermions can be sought from multiple degrees of freedom , with one pair of different orbitals containing the above - mentioned inter - orbital hopping term , while the other two basis can arise from the sublattice symmetry , or from spin , or from the multiplets of the same orbitals .",
    "for example , in a @xmath38 symmetric lattice , @xmath13 and @xmath8 orbitals can form a weyl orbital pair in which @xmath39 multiplets fill in the remaining basis , or between @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals in which @xmath40 and @xmath41 are all degenerate along the zone diagonal direction , and so on .",
    "similarly , owing to crystal inversion symmetry , a bonding state of two orbitals , and antibonding state of the same or different two orbitals can form a weyl orbital pair . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we demonstrate several representative combinations of orbital and crystal symmetries for 3d dirac or weyl orbital nodes . subsequently , four predicted materials exemplify different combinations of orbital symmetries which can lead to weyl node formations .",
    "the intra - orbital band dispersions for the general case with nearest neighbor hopping become @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the corresponding lattice constants . here",
    "we discuss various different conditions under which the inter - orbital hopping terms @xmath44 can obtain linear dispersion purely from the angular dependence of the orbital symmetry , without any specific sublattice symmetry , or soc .",
    "first we discuss a combination of even and odd symmetric states ( under spatial inversion ) placed either along the brillouin zone boundary direction in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , or along the diagonal direction in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "even and odd states can arise from @xmath13 or @xmath9 , and @xmath8 or @xmath45 orbitals , respectively , or from bonding and antibonding combinations of any two orbitals or same orbitals from different sublattices ( we use the case of the bonding and antibonding states for @xmath13 orbitals in the discussion because of its simplicity ) . in both cases ,",
    "the odd parity orbitals give odd functional hoppings to the even state sitting at the center under reflection ( @xmath15 in eq .",

    "equivalently , when even and odd states are placed diagonally in a 2d @xmath51 plane ( similar situation also arises in the 3d case ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the resulting inter - band dispersion turns out to be linear along one momentum direction ( which is odd under reflection , say @xmath52 ) as @xmath53 .    on the other hand , when we consider a pair of orbitals with same symmetry , their symmetry property prohibits the formation of linear dispersion along the zone boundary direction .",
    "however , when either two even or two odd orbitals are placed equidistantly along the diagonal directions , anisotropic and odd functional electronic hybridization may arise between them as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1](c)-[fig1](d ) . for a pair of even orbitals",

    "since @xmath54 orbitals intrinsically break crystal rotational symmetry , its orbital overlap term with an @xmath55 or @xmath13 state becomes an odd function of momentum .",

    "such a combination yields @xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , for the same multiorbital setup along the diagonal direction , two orthogonal odd orbitals , such as @xmath58 , @xmath59 are allowed to hybridize .",
    "the corresponding dispersion , @xmath60 , comes from a linear combination of @xmath61 and @xmath62 bonds .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath63 and @xmath64 orbitals can mimic odd parity orbitals under inversion when projected onto the @xmath65@xmath66 plane , or two antibonding states would also give a similar linear hopping term .",
    "different combinations of @xmath67 associated with different dirac matrices @xmath68 determine the number and location of possible dirac and weyl cones .",
    "@xmath69 helps create nodal points along its propagating axis , while @xmath70 simultaneously produces massless and massive dirac / weyl terms along the @xmath52 , and @xmath50 directions , respectively .",
    "the resulting weyl nodes always come in multiple of two or merge into a 3d dirac cone at the @xmath71 point . on the other hand , @xmath60 term produces weyl nodes in multiple of @xmath72 , in systems with @xmath73 rotational symmetry , and maintain the translational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "some other combinations of @xmath67 , however , can sometimes gap out each other s nodal states .",
    "some examples of such large possibility of weyl orbital nodes in various setup are shown in fig .",

    "the 3d dirac cone splits into pairs of weyl points as the inversion symmetry is lifted .",
    "pair of weyl cones can be created by using either both @xmath76 terms ( fig .  [ fig1](f ) ) , or one of them and combine it with @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](g ) ) which results in contrasting orbital texture inversions .",
    "four weyl cones can be created with various combinations ; for example , for a combination of @xmath69 and @xmath60 , and so on , as shown in fig .",

    "both materials form orthorhombic lattice.@xcite owing to the orthorhombic structure , the orthogonality between the @xmath40 and @xmath100 orbitals is lifted and the inter - orbital electronic interaction is turned on .",
    "the bonding between the two orthogonal orbitals stems from a linear combination of both @xmath61 and @xmath62 bondings , and thus is generally robust against strain .",

    "the bulk - boundary correspondence associated with the general form of weyl hamiltonian in transnational invariant lattice dictates that the fermi surface on the edge state becomes disconnected at the points where the bulk and edge states merge , creating truncated fermi surface ( s ) or the so - called ` fermi arc'.@xcite to ascertain that our predicted materials indeed belong to the weyl semimetal class , we have computed the surface state for a representative material pbo@xmath3 because of its structural simplicity .",

    "the weyl orbital semimetals are applicable to any combinations of orbitals , and does not depend on the lattice or atomic properties such as bulk band gap or soc .",

    "any two - component quantum degrees of freedom of electron in a lattice can mathematically behave in the same way as spin does , and therefore they can be viewed as pseudospin . in this sense ,",
    "two interlocked orbital degrees of freedom with texture inversion enter into the low - energy dirac equation in precisely the same manner that real spin produces dirac equation in topological insulators , or weyl semimetals , or the pseudospin behaves in the graphene s dirac equation .",
    "therefore , the physical concepts relating to the spintronics , spin - orbitronics or pseudospintronics application also apply to the weyl orbital semimetals .",
    "we expect orbitally polarized charge current or orbital current in the bulk of these materials , which are protected by a momentum - dependent phase difference @xmath104 ( see inset to fig .",

    "the nature of impurity scattering protection for different quantum orbitronics cases is characteristically different . in the present family ,",
    "an electron can only scatter from one orbital state to another when the impurity vertex contains a corresponding anisotropic orbital - exchange matrix - element or if the electron dynamically passes through the momentum and energy of the dirac cone .",
    "another advantage of the weyl orbital semimetal is that here the dirac cone is even immune to time - reversal symmetry breaking , and a bulk gap can be engineered by the lattice distortion .",
    "therefore , the generation , transport and detection of orbitally protected electric current may lead to new opportunities for orbitronics .",
    "chiral orbital current in the weyl semimetals can be detected by kerr effect .",
    "possibilities of orbitronics were predicted earlier in @xmath8-doped silicon@xcite and @xmath8-doped graphene,@xcite which are yet to be observed .",
    "the presented new family of weyl orbital semimetal has the ability to bypass many limitations imposed in other dirac materials including atomically thin graphene , topological insulators and weyl semimetals under time - reversal invariance and soc .",
    "an important advantage of the 3d dirac cone than its 2d counterpart is that in the former setup the dos is quadratic in energy which will be beneficial for designing faster transistors and hard drive with low energy consumption .",

    "<S> graphene , topological insulators , and weyl semimetals are three widely studied materials classes which possess dirac or weyl cones arising from either sublattice symmetry or spin - orbit coupling . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present a theory of a new class of bulk dirac and weyl cones , dubbed weyl orbital semimetals , where the orbital polarization and texture inversion between two electronic states at discrete momenta lend itself into protected dirac or weyl cones without spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict several families of weyl orbital semimetals including v@xmath0s@xmath1 , niti@xmath0s@xmath2 , bli , and pbo@xmath3 via first - principle band structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the highest fermi velocity predicted in some of these materials is even larger than that of the existing dirac materials . </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis of weyl orbital semimetals will not only expand the territory of dirac materials beyond the quintessential spin - orbit coupled systems and hexagonal lattice to the entire periodic table , but it may also open up new possibilities for orbital controlled electronics or ` orbitronics ' . </S>"
