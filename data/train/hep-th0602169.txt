    "in this paper we construct all finite - dimensional irreducible representations of the general linear lie superalgebra @xmath0  @xcite . to this end",
    "we introduce a gelfand - zetlin basis ( gz - basis ) for @xmath0 and write down explicit expressions for the transformation of the basis vectors under the action of the algebra generators .",
    "this is analagous to the gz - basis for @xmath9 and the action of its generators given by palev  @xcite .",
    "the lie superalgebra @xmath0 is a central extension of the special linear lie superalgebra @xmath10 .",
    "each finite - dimensional irreducible @xmath0 representation remains irreducible when restricted to @xmath10 , and each of the resulting finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath10 is either typical or atypical  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the present work stems from the fact that a set of generating elements of @xmath10 satisfies the compatibility conditions of the so called wigner quantum oscillator ( wqo )  @xcite-@xcite . therefore to investigate the properties of these @xmath10 wqos we must consider those representations that are of physical relevance , namely the star representations of type i  @xcite .",
    "these include certain representations @xmath6  @xcite having highest weight @xmath11 , that have a fock space realisation .",
    "a study of these in the case @xmath12 and @xmath13 has revealed wqo models that have a finite , equally spaced energy spectrum , with discrete values of measurements of both spatial coordinates and linear momenta , as well as angular momenta  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the underlying geometry of the model is non - commutative  @xcite , in the sense that coordinate operator components in general do not commute ; thus measurements of two different coordinates , say @xmath14 and @xmath15 , of a single particle can not be performed simultaneously . as such",
    ", the wqo models are to be compared with other non - commutative models , see for example  @xcite-@xcite .    here",
    "the intention is to set up the mathematical machinery enabling these properties to be explored for wqo models based on any @xmath10 star representation of type  i. the results confirm that in all such cases there is a finite number of equally spaced energy levels , that spatial coordinates and linear momenta are discretely quantised , and that the model always exhibits non - commutative geometry .",
    "a detailed analysis is presented for those wqo models based on the @xmath10 representations @xmath1 having highest weight @xmath16 , and also for a representation of highest weight @xmath17 that belongs to neither class @xmath6 nor @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "2 we construct all the finite - dimensional irreducible representations of the lie superalgebra @xmath0 , complete with a specification of the gz basis vectors @xmath18 and the explicit action of a set of @xmath0 generators on these vectors .",
    "the section culminates with formulae for the action on an arbitrary vector @xmath18 of all the odd elements , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , of @xmath0 .",
    "these are of importance in section  4 , where for @xmath21 these odd elements play the role of certain linear combinations of position and linear momentum operators for the @xmath4-particle @xmath5-dimensional wqo . before this , in section  3 ,",
    "the formulae of section  2 are applied to the case of the @xmath0 representations @xmath1 of highest weight @xmath16 .",
    "the gz - basis and the action of the @xmath0 generators are given explicitly in a rather more succinct notation than was possible in the general case .",
    "returning to section  4 , it is here that the wqo is introduced .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 of an @xmath4-particle @xmath5-dimensional harmonic oscillator takes the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath5-dimensional vector operators corresponding to the momentum and position of the particle  @xmath26 , each of the same mass @xmath27 and natural frequency @xmath28 .",
    "this hamiltonian can be re - expressed in the form @xmath29 where the operators @xmath30 are simple linear combinations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 for some @xmath33 and @xmath34 determined by @xmath35 . with this notation , the wqo requirement that hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations coincide as operator equations leads to compatibility conditions on the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 that have a non - canonical solution allowing them to be identifed , as stated above , with the odd generators , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , respectively , of @xmath0 .",
    "this identification is then exploited to determine the physical properties of wqo models , including their energy spectrum and the eigenvalues of their spatial coordinate operators , as well as their non - vanishing commutator .",
    "the determination of the angular momentum content of the particular @xmath8 modules @xmath1 is deferred to section  5 , where it is achieved for all @xmath4 and all @xmath2 , by means of a generating function derived from molien s theorem  @xcite applied to the case of the embedding of the rotation group @xmath38 , with lie algebra @xmath39 in the group @xmath40 , with lie algebra @xmath41 .",
    "the outcome in the cases @xmath42 and @xmath43 is given in detail .",
    "section  6 is concerned with an understanding of the position operator spectrum . to this end",
    ", its crucial features are illustrated in the case @xmath44 , both for a single particle two - dimensional ( @xmath45 ) model based on the @xmath46 representations @xmath1 , and for a two - particle one dimensional ( @xmath47 ) model based on the same representations . in both cases",
    "a classical limit is recovered by taking @xmath48 and @xmath49 in such a way that @xmath50 , for some constant @xmath51 .",
    "a final example of a wqo model , based on a representation belonging to neither the set @xmath6 nor the set @xmath1 , is given for illustrative purposes in section  7 .",
    "this time the results of section  2 , that immediately give the allowed energy levels and spatial coordinates , are augmented by the use of the subalgebra chain @xmath52 to obtain a complete description of the angular momentum content .",
    "we close with a few brief concluding remarks in section  8 .    following customary usage in the mathematical physics literature we use in this paper the words `` module '' and `` representation '' more or less interchangeably , and",
    "often refer to `` simple module '' as `` irreducible representation . ''",
    "the lie superalgebra @xmath0 can be defined as the set of all squared @xmath53-dimensional matrices with rows and columns labelled by indices @xmath54 . as a basis in @xmath0 we choose the weyl matrices @xmath55 , where the odd elements are @xmath56 , and the remaining elements are even .",
    "the lie superalgebra bracket is determined by @xmath57    note that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for elements",
    "@xmath14 of @xmath0 , one defines the supertrace as @xmath61 .",
    "the lie superalgebra @xmath0 is not simple , and one can define the simple superalgebra @xmath10 as the subalgebra consisting of elements with supertrace @xmath62 .",
    "however , the representation theory of @xmath0 or @xmath10 is essentially the same ( the situation is similar as for the classical lie algebras @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , and hence we prefer to work with @xmath65 as an ordered basis in the cartan subalgebra @xmath66 of @xmath0 , we choose @xmath67 , and denote by @xmath68 the dual basis in the space @xmath69 of all linear functionals of @xmath66 .",
    "the finite - dimensional simple modules of @xmath0 are characterized by their highest weight @xmath70 .",

    "if for some @xmath79 the condition @xmath80 is satisfied , then the representation is _ atypical of type  @xmath34_. otherwise , it is typical .",
    "a gz - basis for the @xmath63 module is well known  @xcite .",
    "a set of basis vectors is given by a triangular array of numbers satisfying an integral property and the `` betweenness conditions '' : @xmath81 these `` betweenness conditions '' take the form @xmath82 and they automatically imply the integral property @xmath83 for all meaningful values of the indices .    using this gz - basis for simple @xmath63 modules and proposition  1 we have    the set of vectors @xmath84 satisfying the conditions @xmath85 constitute a basis in @xmath72_{n+1})$ ] .",

    "this is because of the conditions  2 and  3 in proposition  2 .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 is diagonal in the gz - basis ,",
    "i.e.  the basis vectors @xmath18 are stationary states of the system .",
    "this follows from the form of @xmath22 given in  ( [ hee ] ) and the action of @xmath187 and @xmath110 given in  ( [ e_00 ] ) and  ( [ e_kk ] ) . in each space @xmath72_{n+1})$ ] there is a finite number of equally spaced energy levels , with spacing @xmath188 : @xmath189 with @xmath190 where @xmath191 . for typical representations , @xmath192 takes the values @xmath193 . for a unitary representation @xmath72_{n+1})$ ] atypical of type  @xmath34 , @xmath192 takes the values @xmath194 .",

    "this implies that a measurement of the position of the first oscillator , i.e.  of @xmath315 at time  @xmath367 with outcome @xmath381 , imposes strong restrictions on the position eigenvalues of the second oscillator , measured at time @xmath382 .",
    "the two one - dimensional oscillators are not free but correlated in some sense .",
    "let us also examine the classical limit  ( [ lim ] ) for this second interpretation .",
    "in fact , the limit of the spectrum of the operators @xmath324 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath325 is the same as before .",

    "the limit of the spectrum of @xmath315 and of @xmath316 is the interval @xmath327 $ ] , and the eigenvalue of @xmath325 is fixed , @xmath328 .",
    "thus , under this limit the solution of the 2-particle 1-dimensional wqo corresponds to the classical solution @xmath383 this simply describes a system of two uncoupled identical 1-dimensional harmonic oscillators , but with a fixed phase difference in their oscillations . in other words ,",
    "the initial conditions of the two oscillators are related : also here there is a correlation .",
    "so the `` correspondence principle '' also holds for this interpretation of the wqo .",
    "the results of the previous sections were mainly devoted to the special representations @xmath1 . however , the computations of section  2 allow us to make an analysis of the wqo properties for any unitary representation . as an example",

    "the branching from @xmath8 to @xmath386 is given by @xmath387 the four terms arising here are associated with the four sets of states : @xmath388 with the entries @xmath389 taking values determined by the various betweennness conditions .",

    ". similarly , the full angular momentum content for specific values of @xmath4 may be obtained from  ( [ gqj ] ) by setting @xmath421 .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath422    although this example is not very remarkable , it illustrates how the methods constructed here can be used , and it shows that the material developed in this paper can in principle be applied to any unitary representation or class of unitary representations .",

    "this requires the construction of a proper basis ( the gz - basis ) for these representations , with explicit actions of the @xmath159 generators , as given here in section  2 .    in order to emphasize the difference with the previously considered fock spaces @xmath6 ,",
    "we have paid particular attention to another special class of representations @xmath1 .",
    "these representations are , once again , weight multiplicity free , so they are easy to describe explicitly . the energy spectrum and the spectra of position and momentum operators in these representations",
    "have been obtained without much effort . among the special features we mention :",
    "there are only two different energy levels ( the difference being @xmath188 ) ; the position operator components are non - commuting operators and have a discrete spectrum , leading to spatial properties that are quite different from those of a canonical quantum oscillator .    in addition , for these representations @xmath1 the complete angular momentum content has been obtained in the form of a generating function using powerful group theoretical methods .",
    "another particularly nice result is that , for those solutions related to @xmath1 , a classical limit has been obtained , showing that the behavior of the wqo solution reduces to a classical solution of the harmonic oscillator . for the previously considered fock space solutions based on @xmath6 , such a limit does not exist .",
