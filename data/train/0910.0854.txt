    "flat directions are generic features of supersymmetric theories .",
    "they are directions in field space along which the renormalizable part of the scalar potential vanishes .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its extensions have a plethora of d and f - flat directions @xcite , which are lifted due to supersymmetry breaking . during inflation ,",
    "if their effective mass is small compared to the hubble rate , the fields can develop large vacuum expectation values ( vev ) along the flat directions of the potential @xcite .",
    "this growth is bounded above by the non - renormalizable term with lowest dimension , which has the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "if inflation is long enough , the growth will proceed up to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if all non - renormalizable terms allowed by gauge invariance are present , each class of flat direction will be lifted by the term with the smallest @xmath4 allowed by mssm symmetries @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", discrete symmetries may forbid some of such terms and a non - renormalizable term with a higher @xmath4 may determine the vev of the flat direction .",
    "all possible flat directions in mssm are excited by terms with @xmath5.mssm , no flat direction survives beyond @xmath6 @xcite . ]    the formed condensate can have several cosmological implications : in the presence of phase dependent potential terms , the flat directions may source a finite baryon number density through the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that they may be responsible for inflation @xcite .",
    "additionally , due to the large vev of the flat directions , all the fields coupled to them acquire a large effective mass , slowing down the decays they mediate and resulting in a small perturbative decay rate .",
    "typically , the perturbative decay of flat direction concludes after @xmath7 rotations @xcite . these long lived",
    "flat directions also keep the gauge fields of broken symmetries ( assumed to be all the standard model ones ) heavy , suppressing the scatterings among the inflaton decay products , thus delaying their thermalization @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energy density of the ( relativistic ) inflaton decay products may become sub - dominant over that of ( massive ) flat directions .",
    "the subsequent radiation stage will then be dominated by the thermal distribution of flat direction decay products , rather than those of the inflaton .",
    "these effects on thermalization require sufficiently large initial flat direction vevs , which can be acquired only if non - renormalizable superpotential terms up to @xmath8 are absent @xcite .",
    "however , if the decay of the flat directions is controlled by non - perturbative effects , the effect on thermalization will be very different than the above picture .",
    "this possibility was first discussed in @xcite , in the framework of a toy model based on f - term type interactions . for this model ,",
    "the frequencies of the particles coupled to the flat directions evolve adiabatically , not allowing a resonant decay . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that the d - term potential provides non - trivial interactions among the perturbations through a non - diagonal and time dependent mass matrix . even if the eigenvalues of this matrix evolve adiabatically , the diagonalization procedure itself may be non - adiabatic , due to a fast rotation of the eigenvectors .",
    "the resulting exponential decay of the condensate has a much higher rate than the perturbative one , giving a decay after @xmath9 rotations of the flat directions . in @xcite ,",
    "it was also argued that at least two or more flat directions need to be excited for this effect to be realized .",
    "the argument is as follows : since the resonant effect occurs in the d - terms , only the perturbations coupled to the vevs through the symmetry generators are counted . out of these degrees of freedom , two per broken symmetry will correspond to a higgs and a goldstone .",
    "furthermore , two more ( light ) degrees of freedom will decouple , corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of fluctuations along each flat direction . in order to have a non - adiabatic mixing",
    ", one needs additional light degrees of freedom that the condensate can decay into . to formulate",
    ", the number of remaining degrees of freedom present in the system will be @xmath10 as long as this number is zero , there will not be any room for non - perturbative decay .",
    "for instance , for the typical cases of single flat directions , no residual degree of freedom is present @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist flat directions that are non - exclusive , i.e. they do not give a large mass to each other due to their vevs .",
    "if the conditions to excite a single flat direction are present , one can expect that the whole set of flat directions non - mutually exclusive with that one is excited .",
    "if realized , such a case would provide the extra degrees of freedom into which the condensate may decay non - perturbatively .",
    "the longevity of single flat directions was later reiterated by the authors of @xcite , where it was also argued that for the non - perturbative decay of multiple flat directions , one needs some degree of tuning of the initial vevs : since different flat directions may be lifted by different non - renormalizable terms in the superpotential @xcite , one may in general expect hierarchical vevs .",
    "such a case reduces to a single flat direction , which decays only perturbatively .",
    "the maximum amount of hierarchy that can provide a non - perturbative decay depends on the ellipticity of the orbits of the vevs in their complex plane . in later works ,",
    "gauged toy models with two flat directions @xcite and examples from mssm @xcite were studied , each verifying that multiple flat directions may decay non - perturbatively .",
    "additionally , in @xcite , the fast decay was shown to be realized for a range of vev ratios of three orders of magnitude .",
    "this range was found to be a consequence of the phase dependent terms introduced in the fashion of @xcite .",
    "however , the question of whether the toy models provide a good description of mssm flat directions needs to be answered .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the gauged toy models of four fields with only @xmath11 or @xmath12 charges have been studied , yet in mssm , no such flat direction configuration is possible and generically , for multiple flat directions , the field content has charges of all symmetries .",
    "furthermore , the production of the remaining degrees of freedom ( [ counting ] ) may be suppressed if they acquire large masses through the f - terms .",
    "therefore , the main goal of the present work is to find a concrete example from mssm for which , the decay of the flat directions proceed analogously to the gauged toy model case .",
    "the flat directions in the models of @xcite are decoupled at the background level , and each of the two vevs evolve independently like two single flat directions . however , having independently evolving vevs is not a requirement for non - perturbative decay .",
    "for instance , flat directions with coupled vevs also have the necessary ingredients for decay @xcite .",
    "the latter systems are much more complicated than the former ones and a precise answer requires extended numerical calculation .",
    "our primary focus will be on the system of @xmath13 and @xmath14 flat directions and we will show that their decay can be described by the four field toy model of @xcite .",
    "additionally , we will address some issues arising from the assumption that the fluctuations along the flat directions are decoupled from the other modes .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath15 system , ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that the higgses and the flat direction perturbations have non - adiabatic mixings . on the other hand , for the toy models of @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the these degrees of freedom indeed decouple from the rest of the action .",
    "however , the latter result is a consequence of the assumption that the fields in a given flat direction have equal masses , an assumption not generically applicable to mssm fields .",
    "if the fields have distinct masses , the flat direction perturbations are no longer decoupled from the higgses .",
    "if these mixings are non - adiabatic , they may result in a non - perturbative decay , even if the counting ( [ counting ] ) leaves no extra degrees of freedom .",
    "for the models we consider , we show that these mixings have negligible effect and the flat direction perturbations decouple as described in @xcite .",
    "we will first generalize the single flat direction toy model of @xcite to have arbitrary masses and verify that the flat direction does not decay non - perturbatively .",
    "the approximations and methods we adopt in this simple example will provide us the necessary tools for the background evolution of @xmath16 and @xmath17 flat directions , which will also be studied with generic mass terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mssm ] , we discuss different classes of multiple flat directions in mssm over some examples which allow for non - perturbative decay , and determine which example is most likely to be described by the gauged @xmath18-field toy model . in section [ sec : formalism ] , we review the formalism for the calculations of this decay . in section [ sec:1fd ] , we generalize the single flat direction toy model with two complex scalar fields and @xmath11 gauge field , to include arbitrary soft masses .",
    "this provides a basis for non - degenerate mass calculation of a more complicated model , carried out in the next section . in section [ sec:2fd ]",
    "we present a complete study of @xmath19 flat directions in mssm , with arbitrary soft masses , where we compare the final results to the ones for the @xmath18-field toy model in @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "finally , we include the technical steps of the calculation in the appendices at the end .",
    "in this section , we classify some multiple flat direction examples in the mssm and find a case which has the characteristics of the gauged @xmath18 field toy model of @xcite .",
    "a classification of multiple flat directions can be made based on the evolution of the vevs .",
    "these are , in the terminology of @xcite , _",
    "i ) overlapping flat directions _ , where the vevs are coupled to each other , resulting in a chaotic motion of the phases ; _ ii ) independent flat directions _ , where the flat directions are decoupled at the background level and each vev evolves independently from the others , rotating in an elliptical orbit in their complex plane .",
    "for example , the simultaneous excitation of @xmath20 and @xmath17 falls into the first category , with the vev choice @xmath21 on the other hand , as an example for the second class , consider the @xmath20 and @xmath22 flat directions , with vevs , @xmath23 both of these examples were studied in @xcite where it was shown that only the first case , @xmath20 and @xmath17 , exhibits the non - adiabatic eigenvector rotation .",
    "this result can also be deduced from the counting argument ( [ counting ] ) : for the @xmath20 and @xmath17 example , the field content consists of a squark doublet , a right handed squark , a right handed selectron and two slepton doublets , one of which is shared by the two flat directions , as seen from ( [ lleqld ] ) .",
    "the perturbations of these fields contain a total of @xmath24 real degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "the vev configuration breaks @xmath25 down to @xmath12 , so the remaining degrees of freedom are @xmath26 . on the other hand , for @xmath20 and @xmath22 , there are @xmath27 right handed squarks , a right handed selectron and two slepton doublets , so the total real degrees of freedom of the field perturbations is @xmath28 .",
    "the vev configuration ( [ lleudd ] ) breaks @xmath29 completely , so the extra degrees of freedom are @xmath30 .",
    "hence , for the latter case , there is no room left for the non - adiabatic mixing to occur .",
    "the previously studied multiple flat direction toy models can also be classified based on the above criteria .",
    "for instance , the three field model of @xcite , with d - term potential @xmath31 and vev configuration @xmath32 falls into `` overlapping flat directions '' class , whereas the four field model of @xcite , with d - term potential @xmath33 with vevs , @xmath34 is a case of `` independent flat directions '' .",
    "we stress here that we expect non - perturbative decay from both systems of `` overlapping '' and `` independent '' vevs . however , our goal is to find a system of `` independent '' flat directions to be able to use some of the numerical results of the toy model @xcite .",
    "the simplest such example that has extra degrees of freedom is the simultaneous presence of the two flat directions , @xmath17 and @xmath22 which breaks all standard model symmetries .",
    "the remaining @xmath35 degrees of freedom in the spectrum may provide the room needed for non - perturbative decay . indeed , in the detailed study in section [ sec:2fd ] , we verified that these extra degrees participate in a non - adiabatic mixing , resulting in production .    of course",
    ", the existence of additional light degrees of freedom is not the only requirement for a non - perturbative decay . as summarized in section [ sec : intro ] , the ellipticity of the vev s orbit in its complex plane determines the range of initial vev ratios for which the rapid production is realized .",
    "however , the amount of ellipticity is model dependent . in the case of circular orbits , the non - perturbative decay of the flat directions",
    "are highly suppressed if initial vevs are not comparable . on the other hand , for a model with vanishing superpotential ,",
    "the motion is purely radial @xcite and even a single flat direction may undergo a fast decay . for these considerations , in the toy models of @xcite , the choice of @xcite which results in an intermediate ellipticity was adopted , where quartic terms of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 provide the angular momentum . due to the complexity of the mssm example",
    ", we will assume that an ellipticity of the same order was acquired initially and disregard such terms afterwards , since they quickly become sub - dominant over the mass terms once the fields start moving , and their amplitudes decrease ( due to the expansion of the universe ) .",
    "in this section , we summarize the formalism of @xcite and derive the conditions under which a production is expected .",
    "we start from the action of @xmath38 coupled scalars in minkowski space in the form @xmath39\\ , , \\label{canform}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is an @xmath38 dimensional vector and @xmath41 is a time dependent @xmath42 real matrix .",
    "we define @xmath43 to be the orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes @xmath41 through @xmath44 it is crucial to note that in general , the matrix @xmath43 is time dependent . as a consequence ,",
    "the fields in the new basis @xmath45 are _ not _ the physical eigenstates of the system as long as the matrix @xmath43 evolves non - adiabatically .",
    "the quantum evolution equations for the generalized bogolyubov coefficients are @xcite , @xmath46 with @xmath47 where , by construction , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are anti - symmetric , whereas @xmath50 is symmetric .",
    "additionally , the canonical commutation relations impose the conditions @xmath51 finally , the occupation number of @xmath52th physical state is @xmath53 the evolution equations can be seen to be constructed out of two contributions .",
    "the first part consists of the anti - hermitian matrices @xmath54 .",
    "as such a matrix has purely imaginary eigenvalues , the effect of this part is to rotate produced particles of physical states into each other , while preserving the total occupation number @xmath55 .",
    "the second part however is the hermitian matrix @xmath56 which causes the change in the occupation numbers , thus responsible for any potential production .",
    "following @xcite , we define the `` adiabaticity matrix '' @xmath57 as @xmath58 in order to have particle production through parametric resonance , at least one component of the matrix @xmath57 should satisfy @xcite @xmath59 the diagonal elements of this condition @xmath60 requires that the eigenfrequencies evolve non - adiabatically .",
    "notice that this is the standard condition for non - adiabatic evolution , valid for the case in which the produced fields are not mixed . on the other hand , the off diagonal components @xmath61 measure the non - adiabatic evolution of the eigenvectors corresponding to the physical modes .",
    "it should be noted that the off - diagonal components corresponding to two degenerate states correctly vanish , as the rate of change of the rotation between their corresponding eigenvectors is not physical .",
    "we emphasize that the condition ( [ adiabatic ] ) is _ not _ a sufficient condition for production ; a detailed numerical analysis is needed to correctly determine if non - perturbative decay occurs .    throughout the paper",
    ", we exploit the large hierarchy between the tev scale soft masses and the vevs , by performing a series expansion in the ratio of these scales , which we denote by @xmath62 .",
    "the physical modes are expected to be either heavy or light , with eigenfrequencies of order @xmath63 or @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the scale of the rate of change for the background quantities are typically of order of soft masses , so differentiation of these with respect to time raises the order of @xmath62 by one . as the matrix @xmath43 which diagonalizes",
    "the frequency matrix is unitary , its leading order in the expansion is the @xmath65 term .",
    "this implies that @xmath66 from ( [ adiaoffd ] ) , we see that @xmath67 is of order @xmath62 or higher , for    1 .",
    "rotations between two heavy modes ; 2 .",
    "rotations between states that are degenerate at least at the leading order ; 3 .",
    "changes in the frequency of a heavy mode .",
    "that is , for the above cases , condition ( [ adiabatic ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "the only components of the adiabaticity matrix that can be of order @xmath65 are the diagonal elements corresponding to the light modes , and off diagonal elements corresponding to rotations between a light mode and another mode which may either be light or heavy . in the latter case ,",
    "the frequencies of the two modes need to be different at leading order .",
    "terms of order @xmath68 in any component of @xmath48 matrix lead to negligible @xmath57 contribution which does not change the picture and will not be calculated in this work .",
    "in this section , we consider the toy model with two complex scalar fields of opposite @xmath11 charges and study the effect of arbitrary soft breaking masses . since we expect a new mixing between the light flat direction fluctuations and the higgs , we wish to verify that this new coupling does not contribute to non - perturbative decay .",
    "the approximations and methods adopted here will also form a basis for the background calculations of a more complicated mssm example , studied in section [ sec:2fd ] .",
    "we start by generalizing the single flat direction potential of @xcite to arbitrary masses , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the coupling constant of @xmath11 gauge and the @xmath11 charges of the fields are @xmath71 .",
    "the quartic @xmath72 term is assumed to be @xmath73 , a choice compatible with the affleck - dine scenario . here",

    "we decompose the background fields as @xmath81 where we parametrized the two phases with their sum ( @xmath82 ) and their difference ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "since the two fields have opposite charge , the @xmath11 transformation affects only the phase difference , which we fix at @xmath84 . in the degenerate mass case",
    ", @xmath75 , the d - flatness condition @xmath85 allows us to have @xmath86 .",
    "however , as we show below , in the general case , exact d - flatness can not be attained and we need to introduce a non - zero @xmath87 .    for convenience , we assume that the initial gauge field vanishes ( @xmath88 ) ( which is kept at zero by the equations of motion also at later times ) . with these considerations , the maxwell s equations for @xmath89 can be reduced to the constraint @xmath90 whereas the background equations of motion are @xmath91 where we defined @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 can also be negative . throughout the paper ,",
    "a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the conformal time . from the second of ( [ eom1f - bg ] ) , we see that the d - flat solution @xmath95 is allowed only if @xmath96 .",
    "although the above equations are all we need to solve the background evolution , it is very useful to write them in a series approximation , to quantify the modifications due to the introduction of a non - zero mass difference @xmath94 .",
    "we will work in the limit @xmath97 in other words , we expand the equations of motion ( [ eom1f - bg ] ) in terms of tev@xmath98vev ratio . for bookkeeping ,",
    "we denote the order of expansion by @xmath62 . in this fashion",
    ", we expand the background quantities as a power series in @xmath62 @xmath99 where @xmath100 can be @xmath101 , @xmath102 or @xmath87 . recalling that we chose @xmath103 ,",

    "the rotation of the flat directions , which has a tev scale frequency , is only sensitive to the average of the fast oscillations .",
    "therefore , we carry out this averaging formally , that is , we assume that all the fields evolve with the small mass scale , so each time derivative increases the order of the quantity by @xmath62 . this way , we write the equations of motion at each order of expansion . the equations ( [ eom1f - bg ] ) at order @xmath63 give two algebraic relations @xmath106 which are solved by @xmath107 .",

    "on the other hand , the final subsystem can be simplified down to a more familiar problem in some limits , and we can extract a clearer picture and a more definite result out of it .",

    "the problem can be further simplified by tuning the mass parameters . in the limit of mass degeneracy @xmath162 , @xmath163 , we see that both the eigenvalues and the @xmath48 matrix components produce two exact copies of the coupled system found in the four field toy model of @xcite , with @xmath164 .",
    "that is , we end up with two identical systems , each consisting of two light modes and a higgs , where particle production is due to the mixing between the two light modes and between the higgs and one of the light modes , as well as the non - adiabatic evolution of the @xmath120 frequencies . a less strict tuning , introduced by having @xmath165 gives exactly the same @xmath48 matrix elements at order @xmath166 .",
    "the only differences are the other combinations of mass differences in the sub - leading terms of the @xmath63 frequencies , as well as the high order contributions to the vevs , which are non - zero in the absence of complete degeneracy .",
    "these sub - leading terms however have negligible effect on the occupation numbers .",

    "the function @xmath168 is time dependent and in the course of the evolution , it oscillates .",
    "it is clear that even if @xmath167 is satisfied at one time , it may be violated at some other one .",
    "however , we can estimate a condition on only the mass parameters by approximating @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 . furthermore , since the production occurs when the instantaneous vevs are comparable @xcite , we also take @xmath173 in order to guarantee that the condition @xmath167 is satisfied when production is expected . with these considerations , ( [ deltamcom ] )",
    "reduces to a time independent condition involving only the mass parameters @xmath174 as long as this condition applies , the results of @xcite show that the flat directions decay within the @xmath9 rotations , for a range of three orders of magnitude in the ratio of the initial vevs ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , we still expect a non - perturbative decay ; however , to quantify it requires an extensive numerical evolution .",
    "the primary aim of this paper was to see if the extensive numerical study carried out in the framework of @xmath18-field gauged toy model @xcite can accurately describe a realistic case .",
    "we have shown that this toy model , which has only @xmath11 symmetry , two mass parameters and no f - terms , provides a very good description of an example from mssm , where both @xmath22 and @xmath17 flat directions are present simultaneously .",
    "specifically , both cases contain `` independent flat directions '' , that is , the fields in one flat direction are decoupled from the others at the background level . as a result , the background equations of motion for the two models have the same form .",
    "furthermore , we found that out of the @xmath175 real degrees of freedom in the problem , only the two decoupled actions @xmath176 and @xmath177 , each consisting of 8 degrees , exhibit the non - adiabatic evolution of the eigenstates . at the limit of degenerate masses ,",
    "that is , when the masses of the fields in a flat direction are identical , we found that @xmath177 can be decomposed into two copies of the coupled system in the @xmath18 field gauged toy model .",
    "therefore , it is safe to state that , in the degenerate mass case , the numerical results of the toy model provides an exact description of this part of the action .",
    "if the action @xmath176 contributes to the non - perturbative decay as we expect , the resulting quanta will be different ones and their production will not effect the occupation numbers of generated @xmath178 , @xmath158 and @xmath179 perturbations , as long as the linearized approximation holds .",
    "another focus of the present paper was to understand the effect of different soft supersymmetry breaking masses to the non - perturbative production .",
    "for an exactly d - flat direction , the fields in that direction have the same soft mass .",
    "conversely , if all the fields have different masses , the d - term will be non - zero and proportional to the fourth power of mass differences . as a reference calculation",
    ", we showed that for a single flat direction , the flat direction perturbations still decouple at the leading order , thus verifying that there is no non - perturbative decay in this case .",
    "the effect of different masses in the @xmath180 example had similar consequences for the flat direction perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the four field toy model with degenerate masses still describes the subsystem @xmath177 exactly when the condition ( [ deltamcom ] ) holds .",
    "therefore , based on the results of @xcite , we conclude that the flat directions @xmath180 decay in @xmath9 rotations , also for this case .",
    "one issue about the example considered here is the hierarchy between the vevs corresponding to each flat direction .",
    "the first non - renormalizable operator present for @xmath22 flat direction has @xmath6 , whereas for @xmath17 , it has @xmath181 @xcite , resulting in an initial vev ratio of @xmath182 .",
    "this ratio , although large , may still give rise to a production if the orbits have enough ellipticity and the mass ratio is large enough .",
    "for instance , in the numerical results of @xcite , it was shown that for two flat directions with mass ratio @xmath183 , they decay within @xmath131 rotations for initial vev ratio of @xmath184 .",
    "if the orbits are closer to the radial one , one might still have a non - perturbative decay with a smaller mass ratio for the same vev hierarchy . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - renormalizable terms are model dependent , and they may be forbidden by some discrete symmetries .",
    "in fact , to recover the conditions of delayed thermalization @xcite , one needs @xmath185 , which requires all terms with @xmath186 to vanish @xcite .",
    "although the numerical results of @xcite shows that the flat directions may decay non - perturbatively , it is still not clear how this effect changes the picture of thermalization .",
    "specifically , the new quanta are produced in a resonant band with momenta @xmath187 which is still non - relativistic .",
    "since the variances are large , the gauge fields will still have large enough mass contributions to suppress the scatterings between inflaton decay products . on the other hand ,",
    "tracking the evolution of the produced particle distribution is beyond the reach of the linearized calculation .",
    "one needs to control the back reaction effects to determine how fast the variances decrease .",
    "in such a computation , the distribution is likely to thermalize , possibly not in @xmath9 rotations , but we expect it to be much earlier than @xmath188 rotations that is required by the perturbative decay .",
    "rotations show the beginning of thermalization of the produced particles , i.e. the initial distribution with momenta @xmath187 starts to extend toward high momentum region . ]",
    "it is clear that the linear study done in the present paper , along with @xcite are limited to the stages of the evolution until the production is significant , and they only provide a glimpse to the beginning of the non - perturbative decay .",
    "for instance , we found that the @xmath180 example should result in a decay within @xmath9 rotations for the range of parameters in @xcite .",
    "however , once non - linear effects become important , the particles produced through different decoupled actions may interact and change the outcome of this study .",
    "therefore , one should be cautious to extrapolate a non - linear study based on the toy model to a realistic one .",
    "the logical step to be taken next is to include higher order terms and study the effect on the decay time and thermalization of the produced quanta . in a recent study @xcite , the non - gauged toy model of @xcite",
    "was evolved on a lattice using the clustereasy code @xcite , verifying that the non - perturbative decay is still realized within the first few rotations .",
    "another interesting result of @xcite was the calculation of the gravity waves , sourced by the quick decay of the flat directions .",
    "their spectrum was found to fall naturally into hz - khz range and depending on the initial vev of the flat directions , may potentially be within the reach of upcoming experiments , such as advanced ligo . for more realistic models with gauge fields ,",
    "the resulting spectrum may be different , but since the mass scale of the flat directions is of order tev , it will have a frequency range similar to that in the toy model . in a future work",
    ", we will address the effect of back - reaction and gravity wave production in the framework of gauged models .",
    "however , there are still some problems left that can be dealt with analytical tools . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the non - perturbative decay of flat directions may have an observable effect through the amplification of curvature perturbations . in the context of natural supergravity inflation @xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the non - perturbative decay of flat directions allows the inflaton preheating to be realized in these models . on the other hand , even at the linearized level , we do not have a complete numerical study of the decay for `` overlapping flat directions '' , although we have approximate calculations showing the non - adiabatic rotation occurs @xcite .",
    "specifically , the toy model of @xcite is qualitatively different than the ones considered in the present work , as well as @xcite , in the sense that the flat directions are coupled at the background level",
    ". a numerical analysis in the fashion of @xcite would be very useful in understanding the time scale of the decay and the range of hierarchy that allows production .",
    "there are many examples with `` overlapping flat directions '' in mssm which provide the necessary ingredients for non - adiabatic evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) , and it is an interesting challenge to find simple toy models that correctly describe at least parts of these examples .",

    "there are @xmath38 such independent rotations one can apply , under which the matrix @xmath48 ( [ gamfin ] ) becomes @xmath435 here and below , an overtilde denotes the quantity calculated using the rotated eigenvectors .",
    "similarly , the transformation laws for the matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( [ eqij ] ) are @xmath436 finally , the bogolyubov equations will have the same form as in ( [ bogoleq ] ) , @xmath437 where we defined @xmath438 and @xmath439 .",
    "of course , as there is arbitrariness in the definition of the eigenstates , the occupation numbers of a given rotated state will vary with the rotation angle",
    ". however , the physical quantity , which is the total occupation number for the @xmath431th distinct eigenvalue is invariant of the choice of the rotation parameters @xmath440      t.  gherghetta , c.  f.  kolda and s.  p.  martin , nucl .",
