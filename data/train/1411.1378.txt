    "[ eq : jacobi ] ( with @xmath69 , defines the boundary of this region , the so - called zero - velocity curve .",
    "it is pertinent to note that the zero - velocity curves for most of our initial conditions of particles within the chaotic zone allow all possible end - states , including collision with the star , collision with the planet , scatter to infinity , or possibly long - lived bounded orbits that may be either chaotic or quasi - periodic ; i.e. , the value of @xmath70 alone is generally not indicative of the final destinations of our chaotic zone particles . a small minority of initial conditions , near the inner and outer edges of the chaotic zone annulus , have values of @xmath70 that are bounded to remain entirely interior or entirely exterior to the planet s orbit .",
    "in addition to meeting the truncation error tolerance in the numerical integrations , we monitored the value of the jacobi integral , @xmath70 , for each test particle .    for the range of initial conditions of interest , @xmath70 is close to 3 , and @xmath71 is small , on the order of @xmath72 .",
    "we found that most of the chaotic zone test particles preserved their values of @xmath70 to better than a part in @xmath73 , but high numerical accuracy of the preservation of the jacobi integral was sometimes more difficult to achieve than meeting the local truncation error tolerance .",

    "we found no obvious pattern in the initial conditions of these particles .",

    "we observe a noticeable asymmetry in figure  [ fig : br ] ( see also figure  [ fig : tvaall ] ) in the fates of the interior versus exterior particles with initial distance from the planet , especially for larger planet masses .",
    "the range of initial semimajor axis of particles that scatter or collide with the planet is smaller and closer to the planet s orbit in the case of interior particles , and is relatively larger and extends farther from the planet s orbit in the case of exterior particles .    in figure",
    "[ fig : br ] , we also observe that most particles with initial orbits such that @xmath86 are survivors ; a minor fraction of these collide with the planet .",
    "this surviving population is associated with the triangular lagrange points , l@xmath87 and l@xmath88 .",
    "these particles are stable over the duration of our integrations , and survive in low eccentricity orbits ( @xmath89 ) either as trojan - type orbits librating about l@xmath87 or l@xmath88 ( analogous to the trojan asteroids of jupiter ) , or as `` horseshoe '' orbits librating about both l@xmath87 and l@xmath88 . for @xmath90 , we find that these `` co - orbital '' survivors span a radial range of @xmath91 within the nominal chaotic zone annulus , [ @xmath92 .",

    "a few of these particles survive in nearly circular orbits , in libration in a first order mean motion resonance , and exhibit small ( @xmath96 ) fractional changes in their semimajor axes .",

    "the outer @xmath99 of the radial extent of the chaotic zone survives on eccentric orbits for more than @xmath40 revolutions of the planet .",
    "however , these particles spend insignificant time in the `` cleared zone '' defined below .      in previous studies ,",
    "the boundaries of the chaotic zone have generally been defined in terms of the initial conditions . for practical astronomical applications ( for example , gaps in protoplanetary or debris disks )",
    ", it is of interest to define the extent of the `` cleared zone '' , the zone in which the density of surviving particles is nearly vanishing . in order to compute the radial boundaries of this zone , we adopted the following procedure .",

    "we binned these values into 98 bins in the range @xmath101 to @xmath102 ; these are the same bins that we adopted for the osculating semimajor axes of the test particle initial conditions .",
    "we computed the survivor fraction ( the ratio of the number of survivors to the initial number ) in each annular bin .",
    "we then determined the interior and exterior boundaries of the cleared zone by finding the most distant annulus on either side of the planet that has a survivor fraction less than 5% .",

    ". however , most of these particles survive in eccentric orbits and spend little time in the vicinity of the planet .",

    "the interior and exterior cleared zone boundaries , defined as the radius where the particle survivor fraction is reduced by more than 95% , are not symmetric about the planet s orbit : the outer cleared zone boundary is farther from the planet than the inner cleared zone boundary .",

    "5 .   for fixed ratio of the planet radius to its hill radius ,",
    "the timescale , @xmath110 , to clear the chaotic zone has double power law behavior ( fig .",

    "[ eq : tcl ] , table  [ tbl : tcl ] ) . a shallow slope prevails at small @xmath0 , a steeper slope at large @xmath0 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is approximately @xmath128 for small @xmath0 and @xmath129 for large @xmath0 .",
    "the shallow slope behavior correlates with particle clearing dominated by collisions with the planet ; the steeper slope behavior correlates with scattering being the dominant particle loss mechanism . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the transition between the two power laws occurs at @xmath131 ; the corresponding clearing timescale is approximately @xmath132 planet revolutions .",
    "the transition mass , @xmath117 , increases roughly linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "the lack of collisions with the star is rather surprising , at first sight . it may be due to a hidden dynamical constraint or may be owed to a computational limitation in our work .",
    "this is an interesting topic for a future investigation .",

    "we can summarize these estimates for the clearing timescale ( in units of the planet s orbital period ) as follows , @xmath137    we remind the reader that these results are obtained for the planar case .",
    "the three dimensional case has two additional free parameters ( inclination and nodal angles ) and is computationally much more demanding : particle clearing timescales will , in general , be longer , and we can expect the collision dominated clearing time to scale as @xmath138 .",
    "we hope to use the present results to develop intuition and to stimulate further numerical and theoretical analysis of this problem , so as to better understand the aggregate chaotic evolution of particles in the vicinity of a planet .    despite their limitations ,",
    "our results indicate that particle clearing timescales can be quite long in a planet s chaotic zone , for all but the very massive close - in planets .",
    "distant , high mass planets clear material predominantly by scattering rather than by collisions with the planet . to illustrate",
    ", neptune would require more than @xmath139  myr to clear its chaotic zone at its current semi - major axis ( 30 au ) .",
    "such long clearing timescales are pertinent for the interpretation of recent observations of debris disks of young exo - planetary systems .",
    "the clearing timescale for putative long period planets sculpting these disks can be comparable to the age of the system .",
    "therefore , given the age of a system with a detectable gap in a circumstellar disk , the chaotic zone clearing timescale can be used to derive a lower mass limit of a ( usually undetected ) planet required to clear the gap .",
    "hr 8799 and hd 95086 are two recently detected exo - planetary systems , each hosting a warm inner debris disk and a cold outer disk with inner edges beyond @xmath140 au and @xmath141 au , respectively @xcite .",

    "for the system ages of @xmath14530  myr and 17 myr @xcite , our results imply that a shepherding planet that could clear dust and planetesimals near the inner boundary of the cold disk must have a mass @xmath146 .",

    "the lower mass limit imposed by dynamical clearing timescales offers an independent constraint on the mass of directly imaged planets in debris disk systems ; and it may be used to estimate the masses of undetected planets . this constraint may become of greater value in the future , when higher sensitivity and higher spatial resolution observations of exo - planetary systems hosting fainter debris disks sculpted by lower mass planets become available .",
