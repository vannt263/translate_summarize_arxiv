    "a detailed understanding of the dynamical and rheological properties of suspensions of vesicles , cells , and capsules is relevant for a wide range of applications , ranging from soft glasses to blood flow.@xcite vesicles are deformable particles made by a closed lipidic membrane encapsulating a fluid whose rheology strongly depends on the bending of the membrane , on the viscosity contrast ( the ratio of the viscosity @xmath0 of the embedded fluid to that @xmath1 of the surrounding fluid ) , and on the concentration .",

    "we will briefly discuss their role in the obtained results for @xmath9 , which will be given for different values of viscosity contrast , vesicle concentration , and swelling degree .",
