    "understanding , characterizing and classifying novel states of matter is one of the main goal of the research in solid state physics . in particular , systems where the thermal or quantum fluctuations are able to melt long range order , the so - called spin liquids , draw a lot of attention since they generally go beyond nel paradigm @xcite .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice , made of corner - sharing tetrahedra is the archetype of a three - dimensional frustrated lattice and has proven during the last years to be a rich playground for studying such spin liquid states @xcite . among the variety of possible pyrochlore systems ,",
    "the compound yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 has been presented as one of the possible realizations of a quantum spin liquid ground - state .",

    "however , the strongly anisotropic interactions tensor @xcite , whose main component is ferromagnetic , induces a local constraint analog to the ice - rule .",
    "the static and dynamical magnetic correlations in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 have been investigated by means of neutron scattering experiments .",
    "short range correlations settle around @xmath5  k , giving rise to rods of diffuse scattering along high symmetry directions @xcite . at lower temperature",
    ", a phase transition is observed in specific heat measurements around 0.2 k @xcite , but the critical temperature depends on the nature of the samples ( polycrystal or single crystal ) and their quality @xcite .",
    "this transition was shown to be first order @xcite , in both single crystals and powder samples but its nature remains debated .",
    "several studies ( including neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation measurements ) evidence the stabilization of an ordered ferromagnetic state , with a reduced static magnetic moment @xcite , while others do not @xcite .    to understand the underlying microscopic mechanism leading to such a non - conventional ground - state , several studies attempted to determine the exchange couplings , trying to reproduce the experimental results .",

    "since the precise nature of the elementary excitations generally depends on the ground - state itself , we propose in this article to address the unconventional magnetic properties of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  through a detailed study of the spin dynamics on a single crystal in the zero field correlated phase below 2  k , which has been little explored up to now @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : exp ] , we first present macroscopic measurements performed on a piece of our single crystal , which show evidence for a transition at 175 mk . by means of inelastic neutron scattering ,",
    "we show that the excitations spectrum is a continuum characterized by a very broad and almost flat dynamical response extending up to @xmath2  mev , and coexisting or not with a quasi - elastic response depending on the wave - vector .",
    "these excitations do not depend on the temperature below the stabilization of short - range correlations ( i.e. 2 k ) , and , in particular , entering the ordered phase does not affect the spectra . then , in section [ sec : num ] , we compare these inelastic data with classical calculations combining monte carlo and spin dynamics simulations .",
    "we show that , although the qualitative features of the spectra are reproduced , calculations predict an energy scale twice smaller than the experimental observations .",
    "these calculations are based on our determination of a reliable and robust set of exchange couplings , able to reproduce both the spin - wave spectrum of the field polarized phase as well as the diffuse scattering in zero field .",
    "the obtained couplings do place yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  in a ferromagnetic phase , yet very close to the boundary with an antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "then , although yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is not a canonical quantum spin liquid as initially proposed , we propose that the proximity of competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations restore strong quantum fluctuations@xcite and is at the origin of the anomalous static and dynamical behaviors observed in our experiments .",
    "our measurements were performed on a single crystal .",
    "first , a polycristalline sample of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  stoichiometry was synthesized from yb@xmath0o@xmath6 and tio@xmath0 starting powders by solid state reaction . to obtain the pyrochlore phase",
    "several thermal treatments at 1400 c with intermediate grindings were necessary .",
    "the progress of the synthesis reaction was followed by powder x - ray diffraction . for the last thermal treatment",
    "the powder was shaped as a cylinder of 5 mm diameter and 90 mm length and the obtained road was used as feed road for the single crystal synthesis .",
    "crystal growth was performed using the floating zone technique in a four - mirror optical image furnace nec sc - n15hd .",

    "magnetization was measured in a squid magnetometer as a function of field and temperature down to 90 mk , together with ac susceptibility measurements @xcite .",
    "specific heat was measured by the relaxation method down to 70 mk in several applied fields up to 100 mt . the high sensitivity and fast response of the thermometers used in this experimental set - up as well as their high stability allow to measure both short and long time heat relaxation @xcite .",

    "it is worth noting that below 1 k , the heat relaxation is not exponential , resulting in two contributions for the specific heat : the short time one ( characteristic time of about 9 s ) and the long time one ( characteristic time of about 600 s ) .",
    "these contributions show qualitatively the same temperature dependence in zero magnetic field , which evidences that dynamics with different time scales exist in the system above and below the transition . when increasing the magnetic field , the peak in the short time response is suppressed more drastically than the long one ( see figure [ fig_cvsh ] ) .",

    "it is characterized by a line of scattering along @xmath41 accompanied by another branch from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ending with a large spot at @xmath44 .",
    "the presence of spectral weight around both @xmath45 and @xmath43 is better evidenced in figure [ fig1:elastic ] ( b ) , where the elastic intensity is plotted versus wave - vector along the @xmath32 direction . while these rods of diffuse scattering are undoubtedly related to the presence of strongly anisotropic exchange interactions @xcite ,",
    "their origin is still unclear .",
    "first ascribed to a dimensionality reduction of the static correlations @xcite , the ground - state has more recently been shown to be fully 3d in the region of parameter space where yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is supposed to lie @xcite .",
    "the spectral weight along the rods is particularly intense around the @xmath46 brillouin zone center , as expected in the presence of ferromagnetic correlations : in the limit of a long range collinear ferromagnetic order , the strongest intensity is obtained for @xmath47 bragg peaks , while the @xmath48 ones are around three times weaker and the @xmath49 peaks are extinct .",
    "a finite spectral weight at @xmath50 is characteristic of antiferromagnetic spin arrangements , which points out the coexistence of both ferro- and antiferromagnetic correlations in the system .",
    "these results reveal that the short range correlations still remain at very low temperature and coexist with the long range ferromagnetic order .",
    "this might be related to the fact that , in our sample , the magnetization increases smoothly below the transition temperature .",
    "finally figure [ fig1:elastic ] ( c ) displays data in the same direction measured using polarized neutrons at higher temperature ( @xmath37  k ) .",
    "it points out that the signal around @xmath44 is polarized along @xmath24 , while the one around @xmath45 has similar intensity in both the @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels .",

    "this is in sharp contrast with the resolution - limited spin - waves observed in the field polarized phase of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "two qualitatively different behaviors can be observed depending on the wave - vector position relative to the rods of scattering .",
    "the spectra taken at @xmath25 vectors located on these rods are dominated by quasi - elastic fluctuations , whereas away from them , the signal appears inelastic .",
    "this feature is evidenced on the raw data presented in figure [ fig1:inelastic ] , displaying directions @xmath52 , @xmath32 and @xmath51 on the left , middle and right panels respectively . on the left panel , while `` flat - toped '' at @xmath57 , the signal becomes quasi - elastic on approaching the rod position at @xmath46 .",
    "the same feature is observed for the scans taken along @xmath32 : the line - shape of the spectra becomes quasi - elastic - like while going through the rod position at @xmath42 and at @xmath43 . finally , along @xmath58 , i.e. away from the rods , an inelastic line - shape is observed .",
    "a phenomenological fit of the data can be performed considering a dual response consisting in quasi - elastic and inelastic contributions multiplied by the detailed balance factor ( see figure [ fig1:inelastic ] , plain and dashed lines ) .",
    "since the experimental resolution is one order of magnitude smaller than the observed excitations , the fitting function was not convolved with the experimental resolution function .",
    "the fitting procedure is as follows .",
    "first , the width @xmath59  mev of the quasi - elastic response is evaluated using a lorentzian profile at different wave - vectors along or close to the rods of scattering .",
    "@xmath60 is then considered as wave - vector independent .",
    "in addition , a broad gaussian peak is used to model the inelastic response .",
    "the fit is able to converge only if the width of this inelastic peak is fixed to a given value .",
    "the free parameters of the fit are thus the intensity of both quasi - elastic and inelastic contributions as well as the peak position .",
    "this modeling shows qualitatively the different behaviors close to and away from the rods of scattering , respectively dominated by quasi - elastic and inelastic response .",
    "note that , in such an analysis , the inelastic contribution is peaked at about 0.5  mev and seems not to disperse .",
    "these inelastic data , and especially the flat energy dependence , are for the most part consistent with earlier inelastic results obtained below @xmath61  mev around two positions only , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see figure 4 in reference ) .",
    "the present results demonstrate that the on- and off - rods behaviors can be generalized throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "furthermore they show that the dynamical response extends up to @xmath2  mev ( see appendix [ annexe : neutron ] for a further detailed analysis ) .",
    "interestingly , the spectra recorded at higher temperature do not show any change compared to the low temperature data , indicating that the spin dynamics is only little affected by the increase of temperature up to 850  mk .",
    "this remains valid whether @xmath25 lies close to the rods of diffuse scattering or not ( see figure [ fig5a : tk ] ( a , b , d ) and ( c , e ) respectively ) .",
    "although the lack of temperature dependence of the `` off - rod '' scattering is consistent with ref . , the reported `` on - rod '' depletion at energies less than 0.2 mev is not observed in our data .",
    "the spectra remain quasi - elastic . as a result",
    "we can not conclude on a slowing down of the spin fluctuations on entering the ordered phase .",
    "this difference may be explained by the low transition temperature observed in our sample , as denoted in section [ sec : exp_mag ] .",
    "inelastic polarized neutron measurements have also been performed at higher temperature ( @xmath64 and 4.5  k ) at @xmath65 .",
    "the data , shown in figure [ fig5b : tk ] , first confirm the magnetic nature of the inelastic signal . at @xmath66",
    "k , the full polarization analysis points out that the @xmath67 contribution is a little bit more intense than the @xmath68 .",
    "surprisingly , it also appears that @xmath68 ( red curve ) vanishes above @xmath69  mev while @xmath67 ( blue curve ) extends up to @xmath70  mev .",
    "a depletion of the spectrum is also observed at low energies , making the generalized susceptibility @xmath71 quite narrow , with a maximum around @xmath72  mev ( see figure [ fig5b : tk ] ( c ) ) .",
    "interestingly , this approximately well defined excitation observed at @xmath66  k spreads out and becomes less defined with decreasing temperature ( cf .",

    "starting from the high temperature , the spin excitations spectrum broadens below @xmath74  k. this is largely unexpected , since , in general , the width of inelastic spectra , related to the rate of the spin fluctuations , tends to increase with increasing temperature .",
    "the crossover temperature @xmath75 between the two regimes coincides with the specific heat bump observed around @xmath76  k @xcite , below which short range spin ice like correlations establish @xcite and the rods of diffuse scattering rise @xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "no well defined excitations are observed but rather a continuum of excitations . finally , entering the ordered phase does not affect the spectra .",

    "first , a model of exchange interactions at play in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is proposed .",
    "based on rpa numerical simulations @xcite , we show that a large range of parameters accounts for the available neutron data obtained in the conventional polarized phase induced by applying magnetic fields of 2 and 5 t . reproducing the strong quasi - elastic scattering around @xmath44 with monte carlo spin dynamics simulations @xcite allows however to constrain further the set of parameters and determine an optimal set of coupling constants . in zero field , these simulations show that yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1   is a canted ferromagnet , which yet lies very close to an antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "finally , rpa and classical spin dynamics calculations are presented .",
    "although the latter reproduce some of the experimental features , they both fail to explain the very large energy range of the experimental data .",

    "since the critical temperatures does not seem to evolve much with the lattice size for @xmath138 ( not shown ) , the phase boundaries have been roughly determined by locating the maximum of the specific heat for @xmath139@xcite . for the optimal values",

    "obviously , at this level of approximation , the model fails to reproduce the experimental data . actually , the calculated spectra consist in conventional spin wave excitations , which can not capture the flat line shape of the experimental spectra .",

    "insets show the neutron data at the same wave - vectors.,width=321 ]",
    "in summary , our results show that for the optimal values of coupling constants determined to reproduce the field induced spin wave spectra , classical calculations captures some of the magnetic properties of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "it reproduces different experimental features , such as the non - trivial structure of the diffuse scattering which points out coexisting fm and afm correlations above @xmath163 , as well as the transition towards a long - range ordered canted ferromagnetic state at @xmath163 . at lower temperature , thermal afm fluctuations",
    "have then been shown to affect the stability of the fm order : approaching the boundary from the fm side , the order of the transition smoothly goes from second to first order ; sufficiently close to the boundary , a long ranged antiferromagnetic order may even be favored in a significant temperature range above @xmath163 .",
    "this succession of phase transitions observed close to the phase boundary could clarify the peculiar shape of the magnetization curve as a function of temperature on a single crystal recently reported ( see figure 2(a ) of ref . ): with decreasing temperature",
    ", it shows first a reversible bump around @xmath164  k , followed by the irreversible step at @xmath165  k associated with the long range ferromagnetic order",
    ".    however , the classical approach fails to explain the strongly reduced ordered moment observed experimentally below @xmath163 as well as the unconventional nature of the spin dynamics , not only at very low temperatures , but up to @xmath166  k. both features are obviously connected , since the part of the moment which is not condensed in the static component remains , by essence , fluctuating . to explain this unconventional spin dynamics ,",
    "the coupling to other degrees of freedom can not be ruled out .",
    "this phenomena has been shown to be of utmost importance in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 for instance @xcite , but there is , to our knowledge , no experimental evidence in favor of such a coupling in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . moreover , the unconventional dynamics appears around 2  k which coincides with the apparition of short range correlations , which is a clue for a purely magnetic origin .",
    "it is thus tempting to invoke quantum effects as the missing ingredient in the proposed model .",
    "indeed , the proximity with the afm magnetic states is likely a source of enhanced quantum fluctuations . to account for the unconventional spin dynamics ,",
    "two scenarii come to mind : @xmath154 the fractionalization of magnons into deconfined new spin 1/2 particles and @xmath167 ) the scattering by longitudinally polarized two - magnons excitations .",
    "the former case is very well known in one dimensional systems @xcite . here",
    "the so - called spinons , which can be seen as domain walls , propagate freely and separate two `` nel '' configurations @xcite . in two and three dimensions ,",
    "the situation is more complex as the interactions create an attractive potential between spinons that bind them to form conventional magnons @xcite .",
    "the quasi - degeneracy of the fm and afm phases in the relevant part of the phase diagram phase for yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 could cancel these interactions and release the spinons . in this view",
    ", the continuum would be characterized by the absence of edge singularity at its lower threshold , with the exception of the `` on rod '' q positions , as revealed by the quasi - elastic like shape .",
    "actually , classical examples of continuum demonstrate that both situations are possible : the classical de cloizaux - person spectrum in the case of the spin 1/2 heisenberg chain , shows an edge singularity at the lower threshold @xcite , the spectra decreasing roughly as @xmath168 ( the exact exponent depends on the anisotropy @xcite ) .",
    "however , for `` xxz '' chains , close to the ising limit of a strong coupling along the z - axis , have a spectrum determined by gapped solitons , with no singularity at the edges @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that the essence of the singularity relies on the fact that many low - lying modes add up @xcite . in this picture",
    ", recent theoretical work argue that the spontaneous magnetization along @xmath169 below the critical temperature should confines the spinons by creating a string tension between them@xcite .",
    "this should result in the discretization of the two - spinon continuum into multiple spin - wave branches , a feature which is however not observed in the data , that especially show no significant evolution below @xmath163 .",
    "alternatively , since a strongly reduced ordered momentum is the sign for significant non - linear longitudinal excitations , the scattering by a multi - magnons continuum should be considered . in this case",
    ", the ground state is long range ordered , with propagating magnons as the elementary ( transverse ) quasi - particles . in the longitudinal channel , however , fluctuations along the length of the ordered moment may develop @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations are however quite scarce and usually give rise to a kind of tail above the spin wave dispersion which is still very well defined .",
    "for this reason , we believe that this second scenario is less relevant .    it should be stressed finally that the measurements performed at @xmath66  k ( see figure [ fig5b : tk ] ) show that the spectra tend to become more conventional when increasing the temperature .",
    "further inelastic neutron scattering measurements should be performed as a function of temperature , to look for an eventual transition or cross - over between quantum and classical regimes , with spin dynamics respectively governed by quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "in this work , we show that the short range correlations that develop below 2  k in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1   come along with non - conventional excitations : no well defined spin waves are observed in both the short range correlated and long range ordered regimes ; rather , excitations spectra are characterized by a very broad and almost flat dynamical response which extends up to @xmath2  mev and does not evolve with temperature below 2  k , sometimes coexisting with a quasi - elastic response depending on the wave - vector .",
    "based on monte carlo spin dynamics and rpa calculations , we determine a new set exchange couplings that allows to reproduce both the diffuse scattering in the short range correlated regime and the spin wave spectra observed in the field polarized phase . this careful determination of the exchange tensors places yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1   in the close vicinity to a fm / afm phase boundary , and , in any case , far from the canonical quantum spin liquid state .",
    "this location points out the possible role of quantum fluctuations arising from these two competing phases .",
    "we show further that conventional rpa fails to reproduce the experimental excitation spectra at low temperature .",
    "spin dynamics simulations performed in the short range correlated regime reproduce however some features of the excitation spectra but lead to an energy bandwidth which is twice smaller than the experimental observations .",
    "we speculate that quantum fluctuations between fm and afm phases govern the spin dynamics in yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and especially that the observed spectra rather correspond to a continuum of deconfined spinons as expected in quantum spin liquids , than simple paramagnons .",

    "<S> in this work , we show that the zero field excitation spectra in the quantum spin ice candidate pyrochlore compound yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is a continuum characterized by a very broad and almost flat dynamical response which extends up to @xmath2  mev , coexisting or not with a quasi - elastic response depending on the wave - vector . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra do not evolve between 50  mk and 2  k , indicating that the spin dynamics is only little affected by the temperature in both the short - range correlated and ordered regimes . </S>",
    "<S> although classical spin dynamics simulations qualitatively capture some of the experimental observations , we show that they fail to reproduce this broad continuum . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the simulations predict an energy scale twice smaller than the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is based on a careful determination of the exchange couplings , able to reproduce both the zero field diffuse scattering and the spin wave spectrum rising in the field polarized state . according to this analysis , </S>",
    "<S> yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  lies at the border between a ferro and an antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the unconventional ground state of yb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is governed by strong quantum fluctuations arising from the competition between those phases </S>",
    "<S> . the observed spectra may correspond to a continuum of deconfined spinons as expected in quantum spin liquids . </S>"
