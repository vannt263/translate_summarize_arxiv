    "the use of radiation - tolerant cmos active pixel sensors ( aps )  @xcite for direct detection in transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , opens new opportunities for fast imaging with high sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "one of the key figures of merit for a tem imaging sensor is the point spread function ( psf ) , which affects both the imaging resolving capabilities of the sensor and the absolute image contrast  @xcite .",
    "the psf of a pixellated aps used in direct detection depends on several parameters of which the most important are the pixel size , the electron multiple scattering in the sensor and the charge carrier diffusion in the active layer .",
    "this letter discusses the psf achieved using an aps in two different regimes .    in traditional bright field illumination ,",
    "the electron flux is such that each pixel is illuminated by one or more electrons per acquisition frame . in this regime",
    "the point spread function has a contribution from the lateral charge spread due to charge carrier diffusion in the active volume .",
    "since the epitaxial layer of a cmos aps is nearly field - free , charge carriers reach the collection diode through thermal diffusion , with collection times of @xmath3 .",
    "the typical cluster size for a cmos aps with 10  @xmath1 m pixels is 4 - 5  pixels for 300  kev electrons and about 45  % of the charge is collected on the central pixel of the cluster . with bright field illumination , at high rate , the signal recorded on each individual pixel is the superposition of the charge directly deposited by a particle below the pixel area with that collected from nearby pixels through diffusion , multiple scattering and backscattering from the bulk si . if the electron rate is kept low enough so that individual electron clusters can be reconstructed , a new regime of operation becomes available .",
    "the electron impact position is reconstructed by calculating the centre - of - gravity of the observed pulse heights on the pixels in the cluster . for pixel detectors with @xmath4 pixel",
    "pitch this technique makes it possible to obtain an @xmath5 point resolution in tracking applications for accelerator particle physics .",
    "the same technique can now be adopted for imaging , provided electron fluxes are low enough so that the detector occupancy is @xmath6  0.05 , and individual clusters can easily be resolved . under these conditions",
    "the psf is expected to depend only on the detector pixel size and cluster s / n ( determining the single point resolution ) and on multiple scattering .",
    "the image is reconstructed by combining a large number of frames , each giving 2 - 5  @xmath1 m accuracy for 0.01 - 0.05  % of the field of view , provided the frame rate is much faster than the dynamics being observed on the sample . in this paper",
    "we refer to this technique as `` cluster imaging '' .",
    "the principle of cluster imaging for tem has been tested using the team1k cmos monolithic pixel sensor , developed as part of the the multi - institutional team ( transmission electron aberration - corrected microscope ) project  @xcite .",
    "the team1k sensor and its performance will be discussed in details in a forthcoming paper on this journal  @xcite .",
    "the chip is produced in the ams 0.35  @xmath1 m cmos - opto process and has a 1,024@xmath01,024 pixel imaging area with pixels arrayed on a 9.5  @xmath1 m pitch .",
    "the detector employed in this test has been back - thinned to 50  @xmath1 m and mounted on a carrier circuit board which is cut out below its active area to minimise back - scattering effects .",
    "a 75  @xmath1m - diameter au wire is mounted along the pixel rows on top of the sensor at a distance of @xmath72  mm above its surface .",
    "tests have been conducted with the sensor installed at the bottom of a fei titan microscope column at the national center for electron microscopy ( ncem ) .",
    "the energy deposited by electrons in the sensor active layer and the lateral charge spread are simulated with the geant-4 program  @xcite using the low - energy electromagnetic physics models  @xcite .",
    "the cmos pixel sensor is modelled according to the detailed geometric structure of oxide , metal interconnect and silicon layers .",
    "electrons are incident perpendicular to the detector plane and tracked through it .",
    "charge collection in the sensor is simulated with pixelsim , a dedicated digitisation module  @xcite .",
    "the simulation has the diffusion parameter @xmath8 , used to determine the width of the charge carrier cloud , free .",
    "its value is extracted from data by a @xmath9 fit to the pixel multiplicity in the clusters of 300  kev electrons , where multiple scattering is lower .",
    "we find @xmath8 = ( 14.5@xmath10 )  @xmath1 m , which is compatible with the value obtained for 1.5  gev @xmath11s in a prototype sensor with 20@xmath020  @xmath1m@xmath2 pixels produced in the same cmos process  @xcite .",
    "the response to single electrons is characterised in terms of the cluster size .",
    "we operate with a flux of @xmath12  50  @xmath11  mm@xmath13  frame@xmath14 which allows us to resolve individual electrons .",
    "electron hits are reconstructed as clusters of pixels . a clustering algorithm with two thresholds",
    "is used  @xcite .",
    "first the detector is scanned for `` seed '' pixels with pulse height values over s / n threshold set to 3.5 .",
    "seeds are sorted according to their pulse heights and the surrounding neighbouring pixels are added to the cluster , if their s / n exceeds 2.5 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for cluster imaging , the electron flux is reduced to @xmath12  50  e@xmath15  mm@xmath13  frame@xmath14 and 20000 subsequent frames are acquired at each energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : plotwire ] shows the image of the wire obtained in the two regimes . with cluster imaging , due to the continuous spatial sampling , the information is no longer discretised by the pixel pitch as it is with bright field illumination .",
    "charge diffusion , which limits the psf in bright field illumination , now rather improves the cluster resolution by spreading the charge on more pixels and the relevant parameter for psf becomes the ratio of pixel pitch to signal - to - background , which determines the cluster spatial resolution .",
    "we also observe that the image contrast improves by a factor of three for cluster imaging compared to bright field illumination , as it is apparent in figure  [ fig : plotwire ] .",
    "the lsf is extracted by a @xmath9 fit , as discussed above .",
    "we measure ( 2.72@xmath160.25 )  @xmath1 m at 300  kev , ( 3.65@xmath160.20 )  @xmath1 m at 200  kev and ( 6.80@xmath160.35 )  @xmath1 m at 80  kev .",
    "these results show that cluster imaging improves the point spread function by a factor of two compared to traditional bright field illumination , for the team1k detector parameters .",
    "we perform the study on simulation describing the detector and wire geometry , for both operation regimes and compare the results to the measured lsf values .",
    "results are summarised in figure  [ fig : plotpsf ] .",
    "simulation reproduces well the data both in absolute terms and in the observed scaling with the electron energy .",
    "we also note that the cluster imaging lsf closely follows the simulation predictions for single point resolution .",
    "the team cmos aps has demonstrated a psf for direct detection under bright field illumination comparable to its pixel size .",
    "image reconstruction by clustering at the impact point of individual electrons at low flux allows to reduce the psf down to ( 2.72@xmath160.25 )  @xmath1 m and improves the image contrast . in order to practically exploit this method in tem",
    "it is necessary to ensure that the sensor can be read out at a rate of several hundred frames  s@xmath14 and cluster reconstruction can be performed in real time .",
