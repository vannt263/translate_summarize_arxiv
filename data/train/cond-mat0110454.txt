    "in recent years the transport properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems in si - mosfets and semiconductor heterostructures have been the subject of a great deal of theoretical and experimental activity .",
    "one reason of this is the possibility of a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) as the density of the 2d system is varied@xcite .",
    "a `` critical '' density identified by a weakly temperature dependent resistivity separates an `` insulating '' region from a `` metallic '' one . in the latter , upon lowering the temperature roughly below @xmath0k , the resistivity drops by almost one order of magnitude , whereas in the former the resistivity increases quickly .",
    "the origin of the mit is still unclear and there is a wide debate in the literature concerning the relevance of the possible mechanisms . for recent reviews on the subject one may see ref.@xcite and @xcite .    on the insulating side",
    "the resistance resembles efros - shklovskii hopping@xcite , which points towards the relevance of localized states and a soft gap in the density of states ; also the thermopower has been interpreted in terms of an anderson insulator@xcite . from this point of view anderson localization seems to be relevant for the transition .",
    "whereas the standard single parameter scaling theory predicts no anderson transition in two dimensions , on the basis of the existing scaling theory of interacting electrons a transition can not be excluded @xcite . besides",
    ", several properties of the metallic side , including the low density , i.e. , the large value of the electron gas parameter @xmath1 , the strong increase of the electron @xmath2-factor@xcite , the anomalous magnetoresistance @xcite , and a vanishing compressibility at the critical density@xcite can indeed be seen as hints for the relevance of the electron correlations ; quantum corrections to the conductivity on the other hand seem to be only small@xcite , at least in the range of temperatures where the main drop of the resistivity occurs@xcite .",
    "the main and still open questions are : ( 1 ) is there a real quantum phase transition , or is just a temperature dependent crossover phenomenon observed ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the nature of the insulating state ? ( 3 ) can the metallic phase be described in terms of the standard fermi - liquid theory ?    in this paper we will not touch point one and two . concerning point three , there is accumulating evidence that the answer is `` yes '' : at the lowest temperatures and weak magnetic fields standard weak localization physics has been observed in a number of different systems .    in order to obtain a better understanding of the materials , different aspects have to be investigated .",
    "we study the influence of spin - orbit coupling on the magnetoconductance .",
    "we assume that the metallic phase can be described in terms of the standard fermi - liquid theory , and therefore we calculate transport properties in the framework of the drude - boltzmann theory . in si - mosfet s with low electron density the major spin - orbit term",
    "is believed to be due to the lack of inversion symmetry of the confining potential .",
    "originally , there has been the suggestion that the spin - orbit coupling may be responsible for the observed metallic behavior of the resistivity@xcite .",
    "although at present such a view is not confirmed by the experiments , it is certainly useful to assess the relevance of the spin - orbit coupling in these systems as well as to understand whether it is related to the puzzling magnetoresistance in a parallel field . in this respect ,",
    "chen et al@xcite pointed out that such a spin - orbit coupling would induce an anisotropy in the magnetoresistance .",
    "the resistivities measured parallel and perpendicular to the in - plane magnetic field are different . such an anisotropy has been observed in si - mosfets@xcite .",
    "however , while the original theoretical proposal in ref.@xcite has been formulated in the localized limit , the experimental results have been obtained near and across the mit .",
    "for this reason a direct comparison between theory and experiment is difficult . in a recent paper@xcite",
    "we have provided a theory valid in the metallic regime .",
    "we were able to reproduce correctly a number of the experimental findings .",
    "the only drawback of our theory was the wrong sign of the effect , and we speculated that this could be due to the oversimplified assumption of a pure @xmath3-wave impurity scattering .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that anisotropic magnetoresistance has been observed in @xmath4 electron systems@xcite , and @xmath4 hole systems@xcite . in these systems",
    ", the interpretation is complicated by the intrinsic anisotropy associated with the crystal structure .    in this paper , we study how the form of the microscopic scattering potential affects the anisotropy of the magnetoconductance in the presence of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in particular , we extend our previous analysis to include the case of small angle scattering .",
    "the layout of our paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and make a first analysis by means of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we adopt the relaxation - time approximation assuming a relaxation rate independent from the position on the fermi surface . in section iii ,",
    "starting from the kubo formula we calculate the conductivity within a green function approach . as a first step ,",
    "we avoid to specify a microscopic scattering mechanism and we simply introduce , by hand , a lifetime in the one - particle green function . in so doing we neglect vertex corrections but take into account level broadening and inter - band transitions . as it will be clear in the following , while vertex corrections may give rise to significant changes in the conductivity , the inclusion of level broadening affects only weakly the results .",
    "a more sophisticated analysis is carried out in sections iv and v , where we will specify a microscopic mechanism responsible for the finite conductivity , namely elastic scattering . in section iv we will assume s - wave scattering .",
    "the green functions and vertex corrections will be calculated in the self - consistent born approximation . in section v we will explore the consequences of a strongly angle dependent scattering potential . in the limit of strong forward scattering we will find that the sign of the anisotropy is consistent with the experiments .",
    "finally , section vi will contain our conclusions .",
    "we start from the model hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a parameter describing the spin - orbit coupling due to the confinement field@xcite , @xmath7 is the pauli matrices vector , and @xmath8 is a unit vector perpendicular to the 2d system . as pointed out recently by winkler@xcite , this so - called rashba model applies for 2d electron systems ( like si - mos in ref.@xcite ) , but not for heavy - hole states which are relevant e.g. in si / sige quantum wells . to simplify the notation",
    "we introduce the zeeman energy @xmath9 ( note that this definition differs by a factor of @xmath10 from the standard one ) .",
    "the @xmath2-factor in nsi - mos structures is near two but is growing with decreasing electron density@xcite . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and magnetic field ,",
    "the original spin degenerate band splits into two bands with energy dispersion @xmath11 we have chosen the direction of the in - plane magnetic field as the * x*-axis . according to the boltzmann transport theory within the relaxation time approximation , the conductivity tensor at zero temperature is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the band index and the velocities are @xmath14 . by further assuming a constant relaxation rate @xmath15 , the conductivity is proportional to the product of the density of states , @xmath16 , times a fermi surface average of the fermi velocities , @xmath17 we note also that , after integrating by parts eq.([4 ] ) , the conductivity may be expressed in terms of the effective mass tensor , @xmath18 in the absence of spin - orbit scattering",
    "this relation becomes simply @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the electron density .",
    "we assume that the density does not change with the magnetic field and therefore we have to adjust the chemical potential .",
    "as long as both bands are occupied , the chemical potential is nearly constant , @xmath21 . for high fields when",
    "the upper band is depopulated it decreases as @xmath22 .",
    "the chemical potential in the absence of magnetic field is here denoted by @xmath23 .    from eqs.([5 ] ) and ( [ eqsigmamass ] ) it is apparent that the transport time drops when we consider the conductivity relative to its value in the absence of magnetic field and spin orbit scattering , @xmath24 . for the same reason , the relative anisotropy in the conductivity , @xmath25 , does not depend on the scattering time @xmath26 and may be determined from the simple knowledge of the band structure .",
    "this observation makes clear the main goal of our analysis , i.e. to what extent we can understand the small anisotropy in the conductance without making any assumption about the origin of the strong magnetic field dependence of the conductivity itself .",
    "the evaluation of the conductivity via eq.([5 ] ) or ( [ eqsigmamass ] ) is analytically nasty due to the presence of the square root in the energy band dispersion ( cf .",
    "eq.([2 ] ) ) .",
    "we begin then by presenting the result of the numerical integration of eq.([eqsigmamass ] ) in figure [ figr1 ] which shows @xmath27 for a special value of the spin - orbit term as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "we have also plotted the contributions for the two bands separately , and it is seen that at weak magnetic field there is a strong cancellation from the contributions of both bands . at large field the upper band depopulates and therefore does not contribute to the conductivity or its anisotropy .",
    "some more insight is obtained by considering eq.([eqsigmamass ] ) in the weak and strong field limits where analytical progress is possible .",
    "first we note that @xmath27 must be zero in the limits of very weak and very strong magnetic field , when the fermi surface becomes rotational symmetric .",
    "when @xmath28 the dispersion of the two bands is approximately given by @xmath29 so that the effective mass in the @xmath30-direction , i.e. parallel to the magnetic field , is modified according to @xmath31 for @xmath32 , when only one band is occupied , the anisotropy in the conductivity is thus proportional to @xmath33 and explicitly given by @xmath34 for @xmath35 , when both bands contribute , there is a partial cancellation : @xmath36 since the electron densities in the lower and upper band are @xmath37 .    in order to give the results for the low field limit , we first write ( [ eqsigmamass ] ) explicitly for the given band dispersion @xmath38 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath39 one may then approximate the difference of the step functions by a delta function which leads to @xmath40 ^ 2- [ \\omega_s - \\alpha p_f \\sin(\\theta)]^2\\over \\omega^2 } .\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evaluating the integral one arrives at @xmath41 it is interesting to note that ( [ eq13 ] ) is identical to the fermi surface average of the anomalous part of the velocity @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 . at low magnetic field",
    "the vector @xmath45 makes a full rotation , when averaging over the fermi surface so that the two dot products averaged over the fermi surface , in eq.([eq15 ] ) , cancel each other .",
    "the anisotropy of the conductivity vanishes . at large field @xmath45",
    "becomes locked in @xmath46-direction .",
    "the conductivity becomes then anisotropic at a magnetic field value @xmath47 .",

    "the edge behavior at @xmath48 predicted by eq.([eq14 ] ) is clearly visible .",
    "when @xmath49 the anisotropy is nearly constant , which agrees both with our weak and strong field expansion .",

    "let us also neglect the vertex corrections , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "we are aware that neglecting vertex corrections often leads to serious errors in the calculation of the conductivity , but their calculation requires a specific scattering mechanism .",
    "the conductivity is then given by @xmath62 in the limit of weak scattering @xmath63 , @xmath64 becomes strongly peaked at the fermi energy . as a result",
    "intra - band contributions ( @xmath65 ) dominate in this limit .",
    "neglecting then the inter - band terms ( @xmath66 ) and with the approximation @xmath67 one recovers the expression for the conductivity of the boltzmann equation approach , when we identify @xmath26 with @xmath60 . in the general case with a finite scattering rate , the inter - band terms and deviations of @xmath68 from the delta function have to be taken into account .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig.[figkubo ] .",
    "taking into account a finite @xmath69 the sharp edge of the anisotropy at @xmath70 disappears , although the anisotropy curves do not change much even in the strong scattering case where @xmath71 .    going beyond this crude approximation in calculating the conductivity we have to pay the price to make an assumption on the scattering mechanism at play .",
    "we assume elastic scattering , and we neglect quantum interference corrections to the conductivity . in the following",
    "we will first calculate the conductivity in the case of a pure s - wave scattering .",
    "the results will be obtained in the framework of the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "then we will allow an arbitrary @xmath72-dependence of the scattering potential .",
    "in that case we will confine ourselves to the weak disorder limit .",
    "in this section we consider a specific microscopic origin for the conductivity , namely elastic scattering . for simplicity",
    "we assume a impurity potential with short range gaussian correlations @xmath73 we will calculate the conductivity in the framework of the self - consistent born approximation , including the corresponding vertex corrections .",
    "the self - energy is then given by @xmath74 to deal with the above matrix equation we expand it in pauli matrices .",

    "furthermore it turns out that @xmath80 always solves the self - consistency equation , due to the symmetry @xmath81 . as a result",
    "the self - energy has the form @xmath82 . to appreciate the meaning of the two self - energy components",
    ", we briefly consider the case with no spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this is especially important for understanding the behavior at large magnetic field .",
    "the real part of the self energy @xmath83 shifts the energy spectrum by a constant .",
    "since we have to adjust the chemical potential in order to keep the particle number fixed , @xmath84 can be safely neglected .",
    "the real part of @xmath85 may be re - absorbed into a renormalization of the zeeman energy .",
    "we then concentrate on the imaginary part , and find @xmath86 with @xmath87 the sum or difference @xmath88 are nothing but the scattering times for the two spin subbands . for weak magnetic field @xmath89 , the density of states in the two subbands are identical and therefore @xmath90 . in the strong field limit @xmath91 the upper band is depopulated , so that @xmath92 .",
    "the scattering rate in the empty band is zero due to the vanishing density of states .",
    "typical numerical results are shown in fig.[figselfenergy ] .",
    "although the general shape of the curves is as discussed above , it is seen that for the disorder strengths we consider there are already considerable modifications .",
    "we now move to consider vertex corrections , following the standard approach in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "physically vertex corrections are important for obtaining the correct momentum relaxation time , which generally differs from the quasi - particle lifetime . for the choice of a pure s - wave scattering potential , as in eq.([24 ] ) , in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the momentum relaxation time coincides with the quasi - particle lifetime .",
    "this corresponds , diagrammatically , to the fact that there is no dressing of the current vertex with momentum independent impurity lines . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling",
    "this is no longer the case due to the presence of extra terms in the current vertex of eq.([17 ] ) .",
    "the dressed current vertex is obtained by solving the equation @xmath93 a similar equation exists for the other energy ranges when one has a pair of retarded or advanced green functions . the strategy to solve",
    "the equation is to separate momentum dependent from momentum independent parts , expand the spin - dependent quantities in the pauli matrix basis , and finally invert the resulting matrix equations .",
    "we begin by separating the @xmath72-dependent and the @xmath72-independent parts of the current operator : @xmath94 since we consider a @xmath72-independent impurity scattering the @xmath95 part is not dressed , i.e. , @xmath96 the equation for the momentum independent part of the current vertex reads @xmath97 we included here the spin indices @xmath3 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "the quantities @xmath101 are a sum of the bare vertices @xmath102 and a term which is generated by @xmath103 , @xmath104 in the pauli matrix space the vertex equation becomes : @xmath105 with @xmath106 some of the integrals @xmath107 are zero and so the equations simplify .",
    "the final result is @xmath108 @xmath109 where the bare vertices @xmath101 are @xmath110 with @xmath111    one might try to determine the dressed vertices @xmath112 by solving the above matrix equations . whereas this is straightforward for @xmath113 , the equation for @xmath114 needs special care .",
    "the analysis of eq.([eq42 ] ) shows that the matrix on the right - hand side of ( [ eq42 ] ) has an eigenvalue equal to one . as a consequence",
    "the matrix @xmath115 can not be inverted , and ( [ eq42 ] ) has no unique solution .",
    "this property follows from charge conservation and manifests in the charge density vertex being singular in the low frequency , long wavelength limit ( see also app.[appendixb ] ) . to see explicitly this property consider the imaginary part of the self - energy : @xmath116 by means of eq.([selfenergydifference ] )",
    "we can relate the imaginary part of the self - energy with the integrals over pairs of retarded and advanced green functions @xmath107 .",
    "expanding in pauli matrices we find @xmath117 which gives rise to the equation @xmath118 this means that the vector of the scattering rates is an eigenvector of the above matrix with eigenvalue @xmath119 .",
    "the second eigenvalue is then given by @xmath120 .",
    "we now demonstrate that the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath121 is proportional to @xmath122 .",
    "we start from @xmath123 we use again the relation @xmath124 and arrive at @xmath125 g^r_\\mu g^a_\\nu + { \\alpha \\over \\tau_1 } = 0\\ ] ] with the final result that @xmath126 so that the vector @xmath127 is perpendicular to @xmath128 and therefore necessarily is the second eigenvector of the matrix on the right hand side of ( [ scatteringrates ] ) .",
    "the solutions of ( [ scatteringrates ] ) for the dressed vertex @xmath129 are then given by @xmath130 plus an arbitrary vector proportional to @xmath128 . from ( [ eq48 ] ) and ( [ eq49 ] ) one observes that this arbitrary vector is irrelevant for the conductivity . for simplicity",
    "we choose it to be zero .",
    "numerical results for the dressed vertices are shown in the figure .",
    "notice that eqs.([scatteringrates ] ) and ( [ eq50 ] ) provide a nontrivial consistency check for the numerics .",
    "= 6.5 cm    it is seen that the anomalous part of the current operator is strongly affected by the vertex corrections . in particular for weak magnetic field the quantities",
    "@xmath131 become extremely small , so that the anomalous part of the current operator is canceled , @xmath132 . in the limits",
    "@xmath133 and @xmath134 this cancellation is exact as we now show .",

    "this can be done by evaluating the integrals we denoted by @xmath139 .",
    "because the green function in the case @xmath135 has a simple angular dependence , one may directly conclude that the integrals @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 are zero . with the approximation @xmath143 the remaining integrals",
    "are readily found to be @xmath144 and @xmath145 with the result that the vertices @xmath138 and consequently the dressed vertices @xmath131 are zero .    in the strong field limit @xmath146",
    "we find @xmath147 , @xmath148 , compare fig.[figgamma ] .",
    "thus for @xmath149 the vertex corrections are absent but they seem to be present for @xmath150 . on the other hand as we noted before the solution of the vertex equation is not unique and also @xmath151 solves ( [ eq31 ] ) , i.e. there are no vertex corrections to the conductivity",

    "typical numerical results for the anisotropy in the conductivity are shown in fig.[figamrswave ] .",
    "the most striking features are the change of sign at low magnetic fields and the sharp structure around @xmath152 .    in fig.[figamrtau",
    "] it is seen that the structure around @xmath153 becomes more pronounced the less disordered the system becomes . for @xmath133",
    "a step in the anisotropy evolves at that energy .",
    "the step is related to the van - hove singularity in the density of states at the band edge of the upper band .",
    "disorder smears out this singularity .    in order to have an understanding of these effects we will calculate the conductivity analytically for strong magnetic fields .",
    "the limit @xmath154 is understood easily .",
    "there is just one band occupied with the dispersion given by @xmath155 .",
    "the fermi surface is a circle which is centered around @xmath156 .",
    "shifting @xmath157 to @xmath158 the problem becomes rotational symmetric .",
    "the ( bare ) current operator in the lower band is then simply of the standard form @xmath159 . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath72-independent disorder potential does not renormalize the current operator , and the conductivity is @xmath160 .",
    "in particular there is no anisotropy in the conductance .    lowering the magnetic field various contributions to the anisotropy appear . expanding the square roots in the energy dispersion , the green functions for the two subbands read @xmath161 where @xmath162 we discussed the effective mass anisotropy already in the framework of the relaxation time approximation .",
    "allowing the scattering times in the two bands to be different , the result of section [ secrelax ] is generalized to @xmath163 further contributions to @xmath164 are due to the anisotropic relaxation rate .",
    "the scattering times @xmath165 and @xmath166 must be obtained by solving the self - consistent born approximation . in the weak disorder limit",
    "the van - hove singularity at the band edge of the upper band leads to a singular ( = step ) behavior of the two scattering rates .",
    "such singular behavior is smeared out when disorder becomes stronger ( compare fig.[figselfenergy ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we restrict the following discussion to the weak disorder case",
    ". the angular dependent rate which we obtained by expanding the square root in the energy dispersion may also be obtained by considering the scattering probability in the eigenstate basis .",

    "limit @xmath168 i.e. the effective scattering probability is anisotropic .",
    "the anisotropy in the scattering rate is due to the term proportional to @xmath169 and is found as @xmath170 . for @xmath35",
    "the two density of states are practically identical , so @xmath171 remains isotropic . only for @xmath32",
    "the scattering rate is anisotropic and is a source for the anisotropy in the conductivity , which we determine as @xmath172 we now consider the vertex corrections . to",
    "leading order in @xmath173 we need to calculate only the diagram with one impurity line .",
    "it is of the type @xmath174 which one has to sum over the two bands . because the scattering probability depends in the strong magnetic field limit only on the @xmath30 component of the momentum , only @xmath175 is affected .",
    "we find by evaluating eq.([eq60 ] ) @xmath176 when @xmath35 the vertex correction cancels with the contribution due to the mass anisotropy since @xmath177 , so that the anisotropy vanishes . in the case",
    "@xmath32 the sum of the three terms we discussed gives @xmath178 in full agreement with the numerical results of fig.([figamrswave ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that the order of magnitude of the anisotropy in the microscopic calculation is the same as in the relaxation - time approximation .",
    "here however also the transport time becomes anisotropic .",
    "the competition with the mass anisotropy kills @xmath164 when @xmath35 . in the next section",
    "we will see that this cancellation is a peculiar consequence of the momentum independent impurity scattering .",
    "we will now drop the assumption of a @xmath72-independent impurity potential and consider the more general case . for simplicity",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the weak disorder limit , where we will neglect the disorder broadening of the energy levels , and terms which are related to the off - diagonal matrix elements of the current operator ( in the eigenstate basis ) .",
    "the results obtained within these approximations are fully equivalent with the boltzmann equation approach , as it is discussed in appendix b. in the energy state eigenbasis the dressing equation for the current vertex then reads @xmath179 with @xmath180 the lifetime is determined from the expression @xmath181 we determine the dressed current operator with an expansion in eigenfunctions , following ref.@xcite : let @xmath182 be the full set of eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath183 which are normalized according to @xmath184 the kernel entering the integral equation ( [ 61 ] ) may be expanded as @xmath185 one further notices that @xmath186 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue one , @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "furthermore the bare current operator is perpendicular to this eigenfunction .",
    "this can be shown in analogy with the discussion developed in the case of @xmath3-wave scattering in section iv.a . with the expansion @xmath189",
    "the dressed current operator can be expressed as @xmath190 from which we finally obtain the conductivity by inserting it in eq.([eq20 ] ) . before showing the results for the anisotropy and analyzing the vertex corrections in the presence of small angle scattering , it is instructive to consider the zero magnetic field case first . as discussed in section iv for the case of s - wave scattering ,",
    "the vertex corrections have their most dramatic effect on the anisotropy in the limit of weak magnetic field .",
    "in the zero magnetic field limit , the structure of the dressed current vertex simplifies considerably .",
    "the scattering probability @xmath191 and the effective scattering probability become isotropic , i.e. they depend only on the angle between @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",

    "going through the algebra one may verify our earlier result that the vertex corrections cancel the anomalous velocity operator in this limit , @xmath205 .",
    "generally however this is not the case . in the extreme forward scattering limit in particular",

    "let us now consider a gaussian scattering probability , @xmath209 the electron spin is assumed to be conserved , so this scattering potential has still to be transformed to the energy eigenstate basis in order to obtain @xmath210 , see eq.([eq56 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath211 controls the decay of the scattering potential .",
    "@xmath212 corresponds to pure s - wave scattering , and with @xmath213 we are in the strong forward scattering limit . for simplicity the strength of the scattering potential and the screening parameter @xmath211",
    "are here assumed to be independent of @xmath214 .",
    "of course , in order to explain the large magnetoresistance such a dependence has to be taken into account .",
    "suggestions for a microscopic origin of the magnetoresistance have been given , e.g. , in refs.@xcite .",
    "at the end of this section we will also consider the charged impurity scattering , which was discussed in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "although our main concern here is the anisotropy in the magnetoconductance , it may be useful to begin by showing the numerical results for the magnetoconductance itself ( fig.[fig8 ] ) for the model with a gaussian scattering probability .    given a scattering strength @xmath215 , the conductivity increases with the parameter @xmath211 and with the magnetic field .",
    "both effects are understood easily .",
    "the kinematics selects scattering processes with @xmath216 , whereas the scattering potential of eq.([69 ] ) gives @xmath217 .",
    "the condition for effective scattering becomes @xmath218 .",
    "increasing @xmath211 weakens the above condition and the conductivity gets enhanced . as a function of the magnetic field the conductivity increases due to a similar reason .",
    "the fermi surface of the lower band grows and the effective condition @xmath219 is no longer satisfied .    the numerically determined anisotropy in the magnetoconductance is shown in fig.[figamrshortrange ] . since now the conductivity itself is strongly magnetic field dependent we scale @xmath220 with @xmath221 instead of @xmath222 .",
    "one observes that the @xmath72-dependent scattering increases the overall size of the anisotropy up to a factor @xmath223 compared to the @xmath3-wave case .",
    "the sign of the anisotropy also changes .",
    "the peak anisotropy is still at magnetic fields of the order of the fermi energy , but there is a weak dependence on the scattering potential .",
    "the anisotropy as a function of spin - orbit energy is shown in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "the overall amplitudes of the various curves are scaled in order to make them more comparable . also as a function of spin - orbit energy the position of the peak changes only weakly .",
    "finally let us consider charged impurity scattering .",
    "this type of scattering may explain certain aspects of the magnetoresistance@xcite .",
    "for a charged impurity situated in the plane the scattering potential is @xmath224 , \\ ] ] where @xmath225 is the dielectric function .",
    "we approximate it here as @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the two - dimensional lindhard function it has been argued in ref.@xcite that the screening wave number @xmath228 is for low electron density large compared to the fermi wavelength with the consequence that @xmath229 the scattering probability is approximated according to @xmath230 .    in fig.[figgoldrho ]",
    "we show the resistivity obtained with @xmath231 and @xmath232",
    ".    the resistivity increases by a factor of four from the zero field limit to very strong magnetic fields . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling the resistivity",
    "saturates when @xmath32 , where only one fermi surface is left@xcite . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling there",
    "remains a weak increase of the resistivity up to higher magnetic fields , since the depopulation of one band is no more equivalent with the full spin polarization .",
    "the anisotropy in the magnetoresistance for charged impurity scattering is shown in fig.[figgoldamr ] .",
    "within the approximation adopted the scattering probability depends only weakly on the momentum .",
    "therefore results for the anisotropy are in the intermediate way between the @xmath3-wave and the strong forward scattering limit .",
    "we have calculated the drude conductivity for a two - dimensional fermi gas with spin - orbit coupling . in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field the conductivity parallel and perpendicular to the field",
    "are different .",
    "such an anisotropy has recently been observed in si - mosfets@xcite . for the range of densities in the experiment @xmath233 ,",
    "the fermi energy is @xmath234k .",
    "taking @xmath235kcm which is reported in ref.@xcite , the dimensionless spin - orbit parameter is of the order @xmath236 . from our theory one",
    "expects a relative anisotropy in the magnetoconductance of the order of several percent , in agreement to what is seen experimentally .",
    "the maximum anisotropy appears for magnetic fields of the order @xmath237 , so the peak energy scales with the density , which again agrees with the experiments .",
    "we found that the details of the effect depend on the scattering potential . in the case of pure @xmath3-wave scattering",
    "the maximum anisotropy appears precisely at the magnetic field , where the upper band depopulates .",
    "the conductivity is larger when it is measured parallel to the magnetic field . on the other hand , at higher fields , @xmath32 ,",
    "the conductivity is larger when measured perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the sign of the anisotropy at low fields is at odds with the experiment . allowing a finite range of the scattering potential , we have shown that the anisotropy sign changes . in particular , in the case of small - angle scattering both the sign and the peak position",
    "agree with what is found experimentally . for the case of charged - impurity scattering we found  within the random - phase - approximation",
    " a rather complex pattern of the anisotropy .",
    "there are two peaks with opposite sign , one peak near @xmath238 and the other at @xmath237 .",
    "these results however should be taken with caution when comparing with experiments for the low density electron gas .",
    "comparison with experiments in heterostructures is even more delicate due the intrinsic crystallographic anisotropies . in both the experiments reported in @xcite",
    "the anisotropy was measured along two crystallographic directions with different mobilities and most likely with different operating scattering mechanisms . at low densities ( close and across the mit )",
    "the anisotropy shows @xmath239 , while at high densities there is a change of sign as function of the magnetic field : @xmath240 for low ( high ) fields . in our opinion , while a comparison with the sign of the anisotropy contains the uncertainty related with the knowledge of the scattering mechanism , the fact that the maximum anisotropy at low and moderate fields scales with the density appears as a robust feature in agreement with our theory .    in summary",
    "we think that the physics described in this paper may explain the anisotropic magnetoresistance observed in ref.@xcite in si - mosfets , and perhaps that in heterostructures@xcite . at more general level ,",
    "our results give a further hint that the drude - boltzmann theory is a good starting point for the description of the transport properties of the metallic phase of the 2d electron gas , even near the observed transition to an insulator .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with c. castellani and v. falko .",
    "this work was supported by the dfg through sfb 484 and by eu research training network program ( project nr : rtn1 - 1999 - 00406 ) .",
    "in this appendix we derive for the sake of completeness the ward identities for the system with spin - orbit coupling .",

    "after decomposing in the pauli matrices components , one gets @xmath258 where we have used eqs.([eq42 ] ) . from eq.([eqapp10 ] ) one sees that both @xmath259 and @xmath260 have to be singular in the zero frequency limit .",
    "we now briefly demonstrate the equivalence of the approach in section [ secsmallangle ] with the boltzmann equation .",
    "since we have in mind to solve the boltzmann equation in the presence of a dc electric field , the distribution function @xmath261 is chosen to depend only on the wave vector @xmath192 . the boltzmann equation including elastic scattering is then written in the form @xmath262 the greek indices @xmath6 and @xmath263 label the two spin subbands .",
    "the scattering kernel , in the case of elastic scattering , is related to the scattering probability by @xmath264 a solution of the linearized boltzmann equation is looked for in the form @xmath265 where the vector function @xmath266 obeys the integral equation @xmath267 finally , the electrical current density is given by @xmath268 which becomes @xmath269 to make contact with the diagrammatic approach we write @xmath270 with @xmath271 the vector function @xmath272 is the renormalized current vertex , which arises in the diagrammatic approach .",
    "this is easily seen in the @xmath273 limit , by observing that @xmath274 upon using @xmath275 and eq.([approximation ] ) , the integral equation ( [ eqb4 ] ) becomes @xmath276 hence the linearized boltzmann equation is equivalent to the approach in section [ secsmallangle ] , where we neglect lifetime broadening .",
