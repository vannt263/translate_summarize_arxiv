    "in an inflationary scenario , quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation accounts for the origin of the large scale structure of the universe . the nature of such primordial fluctuations is understood from the approximate symmetry in quasi - desitter inflation .",
    "first of all , in order to have the inflation , we need an approximate translation invariance for an inflaton field , which forbids strong nonlinearity in the action . hence , we have gaussian statistics of fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the approximate desitter symmetry makes the power spectrum of fluctuations scale invariant and statistically isotropic .",
    "note that the scale invariance originates from the temporal part of the desitter symmetry and the statistical isotropy comes from the spatial part of that . since these predictions are based on the symmetry ,",
    "they are robust in the standard single field inflationary scenario .    however , the symmetry in quasi - desitter inflation is not accurate from the point of view of precision cosmology .",
    "in fact , if the translation symmetry is exact , inflation never ends . since the violation of the translational symmetry",
    "is characterized by the slow roll parameters , it is natural that the non - gaussianity in a single inflaton model is of the order of the slow roll parameters  @xcite .",
    "apparently , the violation of desitter symmetry is also characterized by slow roll parameters of the order of a few percent . due to the violation of temporal part of desitter symmetry , a deviation from the scale invariant spectrum",
    "can be expected to be of the order of the slow roll parameters .",
    "actually , this deviation has been observationally confirmed  @xcite . in this line of thought , it is legitimate to suspect that the spatial part of desitter symmetry also breaks down slightly .",
    "the violation of the spatial part of desitter symmetry would lead to an anisotropy in the cosmic expansion , namely , anisotropic inflation . as a consequence , quantum fluctuations generated during the anisotropic inflation must have the statistical anisotropy .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to expect the statistical anisotropy of the order of the slow roll parameter .",
    "historically , there have been many attempts to construct anisotropic inflationary models  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that these models suffer from the instability  @xcite , or a fine tuning problem , or a naturalness problem .",
    "recently , a successful anisotropic inflationary model has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it turned out that the presence of a non - trivial gauge kinetic function in supergravity theory can accommodate an anisotropic inflation .",
    "it is well known that the supergravity is characterized by a superpotential , a kahler potential , and a gauge kinetic function .",
    "these functions should be constrained by comparing predictions of inflation with cosmological observations .",
    "for example , the tilt of the power spectrum has given interesting information for the superpotential and the kahler potential .",
    "the information provides a hint to the fundamental theory .",
    "amazingly , so far , the gauge kinetic function in supergravity has been neglected in making predictions of inflation .",
    "the reason is partially due to the cosmic no - hair theorem which states that the anisotropy , curvature , and any matter will vanish once the inflation commences  @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that this is merely a prejudice  @xcite .",
    "the reason is simply that we do not have a cosmological constant because of the violation of the translation symmetry for the inflaton . in spite of the absence of the cosmic no - hair theorem ,",
    "since the anisotropic inflation is an attractor , the predictability of the model still remains  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the imprints of the anisotropic expansion could be seen in the cmb  @xcite .    from the particle physics point of view , it is important to explore the role of the gauge kinetic function in inflation . in a previous work ,",
    "we have considered an abelian gauge field  @xcite .",
    "however , in reality , we have non - abelian gauge fields in particle physics models .",
    "hence , the main purpose of this paper is to investigate a cosmological role of non - abelian gauge fields in an inflationary scenario .",
    "there are two important differences between abelian and non - abelian gauge fields , that is , the non - abelian gauge fields have multi - gauge - components and nonlinear self - couplings .",
    "thus , in this paper , we focus on consequences stemming from these two features .    here",
    ", we should note other works on the statistical anisotropy .",
    "the statistical anisotropy generated by vector fields is first investigated using @xmath2 formalism in @xcite where the possibility that the anisotropy appears strongly only in the non - gaussianity is pointed out .",
    "the model has been further extended in various ways  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the formalism has been generalized to non - abelian gauge models  @xcite . as a different approach , there are attempts to see the remnant of the universe before inflation  @xcite",
    ". this could be possible if the duration of inflation is sufficiently short . in the non - inflationary scenario",
    ", there is another mechanism for producing the statistical anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce inflationary models inspired by supergravity where the yang - mills field couples with an inflaton . in section iii , we first solve basic equations numerically and obtain solutions which exhibit anisotropic expansion and chaos during reheating .",
    "next , we present analytical formula for the degree of the anisotropy of the cosmic expansion during inflation .",
    "we also discuss observational implication of our finding . in section iv",
    ", we calculate a lyapunov exponent of the chaos during reheating and find no correlation between the anisotropy and the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion . in the appendix",
    "a , we explain how to reduce the degree of freedom of the non - abelian gauge fields using the symmetry in the system .",
    "in this section , we present an inflationary model based on supergravity where we have a non - trivial gauge kinetic function for a gauge field .",

    ", we explain how to achieve the above form for the gauge field by using the symmetry . substituting eqs.([imetric ] ) and ( [ sym_variable ] ) into eqs.([eeq]-[gauge_eq ] ) , we obtain basic equations for the cosmological background spacetime . from the time - time component of einstein equations ,",
    "we obtain a constraint equation @xmath44 where we defined a derivative @xmath45 with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "we also have the evolution equations @xmath46 and @xmath47 the equation for the inflaton yields @xmath48 from yang - mills equations , we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 note that , when we put @xmath51 , the above equations reduce to those in abelian cases .",
    "we need to specify the inflaton potential @xmath18 and the coupling function @xmath24 in order to solve the above equations . from the previous analysis in @xcite , we know that the condition @xmath52 is necessary for anisotropic inflation to commence .",
    "when we consider a simple chaotic inflation @xmath53 the simplest choice is  @xcite @xmath54 then , the condition ( [ condition ] ) for anisotropic inflation yields @xmath55 .",
    "it should be stressed that the anisotropic inflation occurs for a quite broad class of potential and gauge kinetic functions as long as the condition ( [ condition ] ) is satisfied  @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we solve eqs.([constraint]-[v2eq ] ) and study the anisotropic inflation caused by the gauge kinetic function for the @xmath3 yang - mills field .",
    "because of the non - linearity of basic equations of motion , it is difficult to obtain exact solutions . hence , we first solve equations of motion numerically and find features of anisotropic inflation . from the numerical analysis , it tuns out that the nonlinearity of gauge fields can be neglected during anisotropic inflation .",
    "thus , we can make an analytic treatment of basic equations of motion under the slow roll approximation .",
    "let us solve the eqs.([alphaeq]-[v2eq ] ) numerically . in our numerical calculations , we set parameters as @xmath56 and initial conditions as @xmath57 the initial value for @xmath58 is determined by the constraint equation  ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "we use these parameters for all numerical calculations in this paper since the qualitative result does not change even if we change these parameters .",
    "however , the initial condition for @xmath59 , which is not included in the above set ( [ inic ] ) , changes the qualitative behaviour of the inflation .",
    "thus , in our numerical calculations , we vary the value of @xmath59 and study features of anisotropic inflation for various @xmath59 s .     te phase flow in @xmath60-@xmath14 space for @xmath61 .",

    "there are two phases of inflations , isotropic and anisotropic inflations .",
    "since we have started with negligible vector fields , the trajectory goes into a conventional isotropic inflation . during this stage ,",

    "it is remarkable that the anisotropy can be either positive or negative depending on the initial ratio @xmath67 . on the other hand , for the anisotropic inflation by a @xmath62-gauge field , the anisotropy did not depend on the initial condition for the gauge field and it was always positive . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the statistical anisotropy generated by anisotropic inflation with a @xmath62-gauge field has an opposite sign to the one claimed by the analysis of wmap data in the cmb .",
    "the negative anisotropy , if true , may suggests that the anisotropic inflation assisted by non - abelian gauge field generates the statistical anisotropy .",
    "we should note that the massive vector fields could also produce the negative anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "we note that the initial condition dependence does not mean the loss of predictability because the initial condition dependence comes into only in the degree of the anisotropy and hence it can be absorbed by rescaling the model parameter .",
    "indeed , the consistency relations among observables found in @xcite are independent on the initial conditions .    in the reheating stage ,",
    "we see the rapid oscillation of the anisotropy in fig.[fig : aniso ] , which implies a rapid oscillation of the gauge field . in fig.[fig :",

    "now , we solve basic equations ( [ constraint]-[v2eq ] ) using the slow roll approximation .    in the inflationary phase , the scalar field takes the value @xmath71 .",

    ", the effective gauge coupling becomes very small @xmath74 .",

    "then , we can integrate eqs.([v1eq ] ) and ( [ v2eq ] ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constants of integration . since the energy of the gauge field should be subdominant during inflation",

    "thus , we can neglect the second term in the right hand side of eq.([slow_con0 ] ) .",

    "thus , if the cmb data shows the statistical anisotropy with positive @xmath102 , it may imply the anisotropic inflation with a gauge kinetic function for a non - abelian gauge field .",
    "of course , we should keep it in mind that the data analysis may contain systematic errors .",
    "in this section , we study the chaos during reheating in fig.[fig : chaos ] .",

    "the existence of coherent non - abelian gauge fields is assumed . here",
    ", the initial coherent non - abelian gauge field is provided by the anisotropic inflation .    as we explained at the beginning of subsection.[sec : slow ] , the gauge coupling is extremely weak during the inflation .",
    "hence , we can neglect the non - linearity of the gauge field . during this phase",
    ", the coherent gauge field is produced due to the rapid variation of the gauge kinetic function .",
    "while , at the end of the inflation , the gauge kinetic function becomes @xmath103 and effective gauge coupling @xmath73 becomes of the order of @xmath104 .",
    "the chaotic behaviour after the inflation occurs due to this relatively large effective gauge coupling .",
    "therefore , without the time varying gauge kinetic function , this chaotic behavior of the gauge field never happens .    from the numerical analysis , the pattern of oscillation in fig.[fig : chaos ] seems to change depending on the ratio @xmath67 .",
    "the anisotropy @xmath105 also depends on the same ratio .",
    "hence , we might have some relation between the anisotropy and the chaos .",

    "namely , the shape of the comoving volume becomes either prolate or oblate depending on the initial configurations of the gauge field .",
    "this new feature can be attributed to the multi - component nature of non - abelian gauge fields . in principle , this could occur even in multi - abelian models .",
