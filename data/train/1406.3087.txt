    "the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric ball of dust by oppenheimer and snyder ( os ) gives the most transparent demonstration of formation of blackholes in general relativity @xcite .",
    "the key idea of an event - horizon hiding the singularity at the center of collapsing star is elucidated by infinite redshift of the signals from its boundary as seen by an asymptotic observer , far away from the boundary .",
    "thus , an event - horizon provides a protection from a singularity .",
    "however , a singularity does raise an important question about viability of the general theory of relativity , and covering it by a horizon only reduces it to a minor embarrassment for the theory .",
    "earlier , singularities were seen as artefact of underlying symmetry of the collapsing scenario , as the collapsing dust particles were aimed at the center .",
    "it was believed that any departure from spherical symmetry would make singularities disappear .",
    "however , two major developments in the 60 s changed our perception on singularities .",
    "first , the observation of cosmic microwave background which strongly supported the idea that universe had a singular beginning , and second a series of theorems by hawking and penrose indicating that singularities can occur under very generic conditions both in cosmology and gravitational collapse of stars @xcite .",
    "this essentially meant that singularities could not be swept under a carpet ( event horizon ) but , in a way , should be stitched to it .    in the late @xmath0 ,",
    "the os model led to blackhole formation as the `` establishment view - point '' in classical general relativity , if the remnant mass of the collapsing star was more than a few solar masses @xcite .",
    "however , with the proof of singularity theorems there was an increasing need to protect general relativity , an otherwise very successful classical theory , from such a catastrophic consequence .",
    "most of these attempts led to various conjectures shielding the singularity .",
    "two of the most widely discussed proposals were the cosmic censorship conjecture by penrose @xcite , and the hoop conjecture by thorne @xcite . till date",
    "both remain unproven , and the cosmic censorship conjecture is considered as one on the most important unsolved problem in classical general relativity ( see @xcite for reviews ) .    with progress in our understanding of solutions to einstein equations",
    "the evidence against cosmic censorship has only mounted .",
    "nevertheless most of these counter - examples have been limited to spacetimes with assumptions on underlying symmetry ( spherical / cylindrical ) and choice matter models ( dust / directed radiation / perfect fluids etc . ) @xcite . with advent of string",
    "/ m theory as the best candidate theory for quantum gravity it is considered likely that in late stages of collapse we have higher order curvature corrections to einstein equations .",
    "however , several studies initiated in this area have been unable to restore censorship @xcite .",
    "the analysis of singularities in almost all the cases mentioned above has been limited to radial null geodesics in the neighbourhood of singularity .",
    "this violates only the so called week censorship conjecture . the case of astrophysical interest",
    "would be a violation of strong censorship which requires the singular geodesic to reach boundary of the collapsing cloud without getting trapped .",
    "this can allow for a possibility to model extreme high energy phenomenon ( e.g. gamma ray bursts ) on naked singularities . in this paper",
    "we derive a sufficient condition for existence of a globally visible singularity forming in dust collapse .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief overview of marginally bound dust models .",
    "this is followed by a section on causal structure of singularity arising in gravitational collapse .",
    "the main results are summarised in the section on local and global visibility of singularity .",
    "we end with a section on discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "the well known lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) spacetime @xcite is a spherically symmetric solution of einstein field equations with metric of the form @xmath1 it is sourced by an energy - momentum tensor in the form of a pressure free perfect fluid ( equation of state @xmath2 ) , given by @xmath3 here , energy density @xmath4 , and area coordinate @xmath5 are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as a reasonability condition on the energy - momentum tensor in gr",
    "we impose some energy condition on initial data .",
    "we impose weak energy condition which in case of dust restricts energy density to positive values .",
    "the underlying symmetry of spacetime allows us to define an invariant mass function @xmath8 , giving mass inside a sphere of radius @xmath5 .",
    "the einstein field equations take a particularly simple form in terms of the mass function : @xmath9 where a superscript `` prime '' and an `` over - dot '' signify partial derivatives with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the first equation is the @xmath10 component of the einstein field equations , and second is the definition of mass function giving dynamics of the collapsing shells .",
    "since dust particles follow geodesics the mass inside a shell is conserved , hence mass function is a function of @xmath6 only .",
    "note that the form of eq .",
    "( [ emt ] ) allows us to interpret @xmath11 as the total energy function . from the eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) describing growth of energy density we see that there are both _",
    "shell - crossing _",
    "@xmath12 , and _ shell - focusing _",
    "@xmath13 singularities in these models .",
    "the shell crossing singularities can be easily avoided in these models by choosing appropriate initial conditions , i.e. , considering models with decreasing density away from the center , and by not giving any additional inward velocity to the outer shells .",
    "the first condition is physically realistic as we expect stars to have maximum density at the center .",
    "the marginally bound scenario ensures the second condition as all shells start at rest from infinity .",
    "thus , we will be concerned with shell focusing singularities here .",
    "the ltb solution for the marginally bound case can be written as @xmath14 this is the integrated form of eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] , and where we have fixed the integration constant using scaling freedom @xmath15 , i.e. , on initial hypersurface we equate the proper and the coordinate distance . in",
    "what follows we shall analyse the marginally bound models ( @xmath16 ) only .",
    "as discussed in previous section , in dust spacetime , the shell crossing singularities can be easily avoided by a suitable choice of initial data . from eq .",
    "( [ soln ] ) , the singularity curve describing a shell focusing singularity @xmath17 , in spacetime is @xmath18 since a physically reasonable density profile is a monotonic decreasing function away from the center , the singularity forms at the center first . also , this restricts the spacetime coordinates to values @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the boundary of the collapsing cloud .",
    "the characteristic feature of a black hole is that it represents a region of spacetime from where no information ( matter or energy ) can escape . this phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that propagation of light is influenced by gravitational field . if the gravitational field of an object is strong enough the light can not escape eventually falling back on it .",
    "this allows us to define a wavefront which is moving outwards yet decreasing in its area , a criterion for light being trapped .",
    "more precisely can we define a trapped surface as `` a closed ( compact without boundary ) spacelike 2-surface which has the property that the null geodesics which meet this surface orthogonally are all converging in its neighbourhood '' @xcite .",
    "the equation for outgoing radial null geodesics in the marginally bound dust spacetime is @xmath21 using outgoing null geodesic equation we can derive the following expression for a change in the proper distance @xmath5 as @xmath22 since we are assuming no shell - crossings ( @xmath23 ) everywhere in the spacetime , @xmath24 is either positive , negative or @xmath25 , when @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the surface defined by @xmath29 describes a locus of the turning points of out - going radial null geodesics .",
    "this is the equation for an apparent horizon .",
    "thus , a second condition for a physically reasonable initial data is absence of trapped surfaces ( @xmath30 ) everywhere in the collapsing cloud",
    ".    it has been shown by several authors @xcite that dust collapse models lead to violation of cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "this revived a wide interest in the problem and in past two decades we have seen censorship violation in various collapse scenarios . essentially , most of the analytical approaches in this area analyse null geodesics in the neighbourhood of the singularity .",
    "what is shown is that depending on initial data we can have radial null geodesics in the spacetime with their past endpoints at singularity . due to the vacuum exterior the event and the apparent horizons meet at the boundary .",
    "when traced backwards the apparent horizon meets singularity at the center .",
    "however , tracing the event horizon requires integrating the radial null geodesic equation .",
    "it is only in the homogeneous dust collapse model , studied by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite , that one can draw the event horizon curve .    in what follows",
    "we give a brief review of results on local visibility of singularities in dust collapse @xcite .",
    "consider outgoing radial null geodesics in the spacetime ( [ rngs ] ) .",
    "the geodesics with past end points at singularity @xmath31 , take the following approximate form : @xmath32 near center . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are both positive for geodesics to exist in the spacetime . using solution ( [ soln ] ) we expand @xmath35 near the center , and evaluate @xmath36 using eqn .",
    "( [ approxgeo ] ) above .",
    "thus we can write null geodesic equation ( [ rngs ] ) near the center where left hand side has unknown parameters @xmath34 and @xmath33 and its right hand side has initial data in terms of mass ( or energy density ) expanded near @xmath37 . thus , existence or otherwise of a naked singularity , which requires positive definite values for @xmath34 and @xmath33 gets determined in terms of initial data . in marginally bound dust collapse",
    "if the leading inhomogeneity term in the density near the center is either linear or quadratic the singularity is always naked ( locally ) @xcite",
    ". if it is cubic we have both black hole and naked singularity @xcite",
    "the role of apparent horizon in describing final fate of gravitational collapse and its relation to initial data in dust spacetimes was shown in @xcite .",
    "the analytical work in this area has been limited to only local analysis of geodesics surrounding central singularity .",
    "an astrophysically interesting scenario would be to have a globally visible singularity @xcite .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ soln ] ) , ( [ singcurve ] ) and ( [ apparent ] ) we can write @xmath38 since regular initial data ensures mass should vanish at the center , singularity curve and apparent horizon curve meet there . whereas the positivity of mass for any non - central shell ( @xmath39 ) ensures that all the non - central points on the singularity curve are safely trapped .",
    "therefore , it is only the central shell focusing singularity from where light may escape getting trapped . in what follows",
    "we shall focus on the central singularity ( @xmath40 ) .    in marginally bound dust collapse",
    "initial data can be specified in terms on local expansion of density near central singularity ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath41 and the corresponding mass function takes the form @xmath42 here @xmath43 takes integral values . as far as local visibility",
    "is concerned it is the first non - zero value of @xmath44 which decides the end - state of collapse @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "if the first non - zero term near the center is @xmath45 or @xmath46 , the singularity is always visible . at @xmath47",
    "we can have a transition from visible singularity to a blackhole depending on initial data ( central density and inhomogeneity ) .",
    "for @xmath48 the collapse always ends in a blackhole .",
    "however , the analysis provides a sufficient condition for the local visibility of singularity as it is limited to conditions near the center . in the remaining paper",
    "we have developed a sufficient condition for the global visibility of singularity .    in what follows it",
    "is convenient to define a auxiliary variable so that @xmath49 . the equation of outgoing null geodesics ( [ rngs ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath50 due to absence of any pressure the dust particles follow geodesics , and this conserves mass within a co - moving radius .",
    "thus , instead of comoving distance @xmath6 , we can also use mass function @xmath51 as a coordinate .",
    "let @xmath52 , be the definition of the auxiliary variable . in terms of @xmath53 the dust solution ( [ soln ]",
    ") can be re - written as @xmath54 this solution takes a particularly simple form in terms of time of formation of singularity @xmath55 , @xmath56 further , defining @xmath57 , we can re - write the radial null geodesic equation eq .",

    "if @xmath66 attains a finite value in the limit of approach to center it implies the geodesic is singular ; as @xmath53 tends to zero @xmath70 approaches @xmath25 ( @xmath71 ) and the singularity is approached .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath66 necessarily blows up if the null geodesic approaches a regular center . in a special case ,",
    "when @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath72 , @xmath70 approaches a non - zero value , and a regular center is approached and @xmath66 blows up .",
    "the apparent horizon is at @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 any region of spacetime where @xmath75 is free of trapped surfaces .",
    "if a geodesic crosses the apparent horizon it has to fall back into the singularity , i.e. after crossing apparent horizon @xmath66 remains bounded in interval ( 0,2/3 ) .",
    "therefore , for a singular null geodesic to escape to infinity , @xmath66 has to remain greater than @xmath76 on it throughout the collapsing cloud . in what follows",
