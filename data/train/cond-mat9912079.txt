    "with the advances in the nanofabrication technology , the study of the two dimensional electron gas(2 deg ) has become an interesting topic .",
    "quantum dots are two - dimensional electrons confined within a finite area by applying various gate voltages .",
    "it is an example of a finite size quantum system where the number of particles can be varied from a few to few thousands . in recent years",
    ", these systems have received considerable attention as a tool to study the nature of electron - electron system in a finite size system . in particular one of the goals",
    "has been to determine the far - infrared response of the system and to understand the nature of collective excitations .",
    "though the collective excitations have been extensively studied in other finite fermion systems like atomic nuclei@xcite and metal clusters@xcite , in three dimensions , it still remains to be analysed in detail in two - dimensional quantum dots .",
    "recently , evidence has been found for a strong collective dipole mode and its splitting in the presence of the magnetic field in far infrared spectroscopy experiments@xcite .",
    "there is likely a further evidence of a quadrupole excitation in a large quantum dot in the presence of magnetic field@xcite in experiments done using far infrared spectroscopy .",
    "recently collective spin and charge density excitations in a quantum dot containing 200 electrons have been observed @xcite .",
    "considerable amount of theoretical work has been done to study the nature of edge manetoplasmon excitations of quantum dots in strong magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "the collective excitations have been studied within the classical hydrodynamical model of quantum dot@xcite .",
    "a lot of effort has been made to understand the nature of the collective excitations in these nanostructures by using different theoretical tools .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed results on the nature of the collective excitations in quantum dot systems at zero magnetic field .",
    "we consider the multipole excitations and breathing modes of a quantum dot with finite number of electrons , and calculate analytically the excitation energies within sum rule approach .",
    "so far most of the microscopic calculations have been done numerically , and the results are therefore restricted by the particular choice of the device parameters .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate the collective excitations in a dot containing large number of electrons analytically , to study the variation of the excitation energies with the device parameters and with the change of electron number . in a quasi zero dimensional nanostructure like quantum dot , the nature of electron- electron in teraction is not very transperent .",
    "other than the conventional coulomb interaction , we consider two other types of effective interactions .",
    "the advantage of obtaining an analytical expression is the variation of the collective modes with the interaction strength becomes clear .",
    "the ground state density profile is evaluated using the simple thomas - fermi(tf ) approximation .",
    "the t - f approximation gives a good account of the bulk properties of the system when the number of particles , @xmath1 , is large@xcite .",
    "the t - f density deviates from the full quantum mechanical density only in the region very close to the turning point and it neglects the asymptotic tail of the density .",
    "for the higher multipolarities the density fluctuations shift more towards the edge . but for estimating the low lying multipole excitations of a large quantum system , the t - f density is good enough and the edge correction of the density gives rise to a small correction over the leading order estimate .",
    "we estimate the edge correction for some important moments of density , and the corrections typically goes as , @xmath2 , where the term @xmath3 increases with increasing multipolarity @xmath0 .",
    "this estimate of the edge correction justifies the evaluation of different moments of a large quantum system by using t - f density . so that the low - lying collective excitations of a large dot can be estimated within the t - f approximation .    for the electron - electron interaction we have taken three different forms of the two - body interaction .",
    "these forms are chosen so as to facilitate analytical calculations of excitation energies .",
    "however , we also point out that in some limits these approximate the effective electron - electron interaction in a quantum dot .",
    "since the effective interaction changes with the number of particles , it is useful to work with different approximate interactions .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the ground state of the quantum dot in the simple tf approximation assuming various forms of the electron - electron interaction . in sec.iii",
    "we discuss the rpa dynamic polarisibility of quantum dot for different excitation operators , and the corresponding strengh distributions of such excitations .",
    "also we discuss how the collective excitation energy can be estimated using the moments of the corresponding strength distribution .",
    "we explicitely evaluate the multipole excitation energy for different models of quantum dot in sec.iv .",
    "in sec.v we derive the sum rules and excitation energy for the breathing mode of the dot , from simple scaling argument .",
    "section vi contains a summary . in appendix a and appendix b",
    ", we outline the corrections that may arise from using t - f density for the ground state .",
    "the two dimensional hamiltonian to describe the many electrons in a quantum dot may be written as @xmath4.\\ ] ] here we have assumed that the electrons are confined in a parabolic potential which is a good approximation to the device potential , @xmath5 is the effective mass of the electron in gaas sample , which is @xmath6 times the actual electron mass .",
    "we estimate the density profile of the many - body system by using t - f energy functional .",
    "it is well known that for the large number particles , t - f density profile agrees very well with the full quantum mechanical density , except very close to the turning point .",
    "asymptotic tail of the density profile can be obtained by including the gradient corrections in the density functional , which includes the higher order @xmath7 corrections in the t - f energy functional . in evaluating the energy weighted sum rules",
    ", t - f density gives the leading order contribution , and the small edge correction can give rise to the higher order @xmath8 corrections . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is sufficiently large so that these corrections may be neglected .",
    "the energy functional describing the ground state of this many body system is @xmath9 = \\int d^{2}r [ \\tau(r ) + v_{sc}(r)\\rho(r)],\\ ] ] where the self - consistent potential @xmath10 is given by , @xmath11 within the thomas - fermi approximation the kinetic - energy density is given by , @xmath12 for spin @xmath13 electrons in an unpolarised dot . the self - consistent equation for determining the density",
    "is obtained by minimising the free energy @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the chemical potential .",
    "thus we have the following self - consistent equation for the density , @xmath16 the chemical potential is determined by conserving the number of particles in the dot , @xmath17    in the following subsections we consider three different forms of the repulsive two body interaction and try to find out self - consistent density analytically .",
    "we first show that for logarithmic interaction and short - range interaction , the self - consistent density can be solved exactly .",
    "however , for coulomb interaction the above integral equation can not be solved exactly .",
    "therefore we estimate the ground - state density profile by variational method .",
    "the two dimensional hamiltonian with logarithmic interaction is given by , @xmath18 - g \\sum_{i",
    "< j}^{n } log[\\frac{|\\vec{r_{i } } - \\vec{r_{j}}|}{a}].\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 is an arbitary parameter which determines the range of the two - body interaction , and @xmath20 is the strength of the interaction .",
    "the advantange of taking logarithmic two - body interaction is that the thomas - fermi model is exactly solvable @xcite , and it can mimic the realistic two body interaction .",
    "this model may also be justified from the finite thickness effect of the two dimensional system @xcite . as shown by zhang and dassarma@xcite , the effective interaction for a quasi two - dimensional electron system in momentum space",
    "is given by , @xmath21 where , @xmath22 has dimensions of inverse length .",
    "the effective potential given above behaves approximately as @xmath23 over small distances and @xmath24 for large distances .",
    "the strength of the logarithmic interaction can be written as @xmath25 .",
    "we now consider the case when electrons in the dot are interacting by a very short range delta function interaction,@xmath53 .",
    "for a dilute fermi gas the two body interactions can be approximated by delta function pseudopotential .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath54 is related to the s - wave scattering length @xmath19 in the following way , @xmath55 .",
    "also it has been found that for 2-d electron gas in strong magnetic field the short range pseudo - potential is a very good approximation @xcite .",
    "this system is also interesting because short range interaction among the fermions can mimic exclusion statistics@xcite .",
    "the energy functional of the electrons with short range two body interaction can be written as , @xmath9 = \\int d^{2}r [ \\frac{\\hbar^{2 } \\pi}{2 m^ { * } } \\rho^2(r ) + \\frac{1}{2 } m^ { * } \\omega^{2 } r^{2 } \\rho(r ) + \\frac{v_{0}}{2 } \\rho^2(r)].\\ ] ] by minimizing the energy functional with respect to the density , we obtain the following equation , @xmath56 where @xmath15 is the chemical potential of the system .",
    "the self consistent density can be written as , @xmath57 where , @xmath58 is the dimensionless variable @xmath59 and other parameters are defined as , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the turning point of the density distribution can be determined from the conservation of the total number of particles , @xmath62    the results thus obtained with short range interaction are similar to the non - interacting but confined electrons .",
    "the only difference with the non - interacting electrons is the scaling factor @xmath63 both in density and in the number of particles .",
    "next we consider the case where the two - body electron electron interaction is @xmath64 .",
    "for this form of the two - body interaction , t - f self consistency equation for density can not be solved analytically . to do the rest of the calculations analytically",
    ", we take a variational ansatz for the self consistent density profile and determine the parameters of the ansatz by minimising the energy functional . in zero magnetic field",
    "we can take the following ansatz for the density profile , @xmath65 where , @xmath66 is the variational parameter , and @xmath58 is the dimensionless variable @xmath67 .",
    "the density of the non interacting electron gas corresponds to the limit @xmath68 .",
    "the inclusion of the two body repulsion flattens the density profile , which can be thought of as the reduction of the frequency @xmath69 of the effective mean field potential .",
    "so the electron - electron interaction makes @xmath70 . in the case of short - range interaction",
    "the density profile is parabolic , and also for the logarithmic interaction density profile becomes parabolic in the strong confinement limit .",
    "we expect at zero magnetic field the ansatz can give good estimate of the ground state density in the strong confinement limit .",
    "we must , however , caution that this ansatz breaks down in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "the ground state density here deviates from the parabolic form and is approximately @xmath71 @xcite . for convenience",
    "we define @xmath72 .",
    "the turning point @xmath73 can be calculated from the total number of electrons @xmath1 , @xmath74 let us calculate the contributions to the energy coming from the different parts of the density functional as a function of the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "contribution to the kinetic energy is given by , @xmath76 the potential energy due to the external confinement is given by , @xmath77 the interaction energy within the hartree approximation is given by , @xmath78 where , @xmath79 . in momentum space",
    "the above expression can be written as , @xmath80 where , @xmath81 after performing the integration we obtain the hartree energy in the following form , @xmath82 in terms of the variational parameter @xmath66 and the number of particles @xmath1 , the total energy of the system is given by , @xmath83 to get the minimum energy , the total energy is be minimized with respect to the variational parameter @xmath66 when the number of particles @xmath1 is held fixed .",
    "the @xmath66 that one obtains at the minimum of the energy is therefore a function of @xmath1 , among other things .",
    "this is in contrast to the short - range interaction where @xmath84 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "having thus determined the ground state energy and the density in the tf approximation , we now use these in evaluating the collective excitation energies for different types of collective excitations .",
    "the choice of the excitation operator @xmath87 is dictated by the physics that one wants to describe . in this paper",
    "we consider two types of collective excitations : the multipole excitation modes and the breathing modes in a the quantum dot . in two - dimensions multipole excitation operator",
    "can be written as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the complex variable @xmath99 .",

    "the collective excitation energy can be estimated from the sum - rules of the corresponding excitation operators .    for a highly collective state",
    "the strength distribution becomes a sharply peaked function around the collective excitation energy . if the excitation operator @xmath87 is hermitian , or if the hamiltonian does not contain any time - reversal symmetry breaking term ( as in the quantum dot without magnetic field )",
    ", then we can take @xmath101 and the low lying collective excitation energy is given by , @xmath102 near the collective excitation energy , we can approximate the strength distribution by a delta function @xmath103 , then we can trivially show the above form of collective excitation .",
    "but in general the strength function has a finite width . following ref.@xcite",
    ", one can then derive the above form of collective excitation energy for multipole excitations by using the variational principle . given the @xmath1 electron ground state @xmath104 , it is possible to find the collective excitation energy and the collective state @xmath105 , if one is able to find an operator @xmath106 , which satisfies the following equation of motion , @xmath107 = \\hbar \\omega_{coll } o^{\\dagger}.\\ ] ] the state @xmath108 has excitation energy @xmath109 .",

    ", we obtain the collective excitation energy as @xmath114 .",
    "the multipole excitations in a quantum dot lead to the change in total angular momentum . in particular , the dipole excitation in parabolic quantum dot has been well studied both theoretically and experimentally . the corresponding operator for the dipole excitation operator is given by @xmath115 .",

    "the calculation of @xmath119 is more complicated . to make the analysis transparent",
    ", we consider the various contributions to the third moment separately .",
