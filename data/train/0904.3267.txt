    "jamming is a key concept to characterize the transition of athermal systems such as granular materials @xcite , colloidal suspensions @xcite , emulsions and forms @xcite .",

    "recent studies have revealed that the jamming is the transition to appear in the pressure , the coordination number , the elastic moduli @xcite , and the soft modes @xcite . in particular , olsson and teitel @xcite , and hatano @xcite numerically found scaling relations for the shear stress , the pressure , and the kinetic temperature , which are characterized by some critical exponents .",
