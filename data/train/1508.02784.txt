    "we have recently @xcite made the hypothesis that string loops arising from a scaling network of cosmic strings seed the formation of the globular clusters which are observed to be distributed in the halos of galaxies , in particular our own milky way galaxy .",
    "our model easily explains the observational facts that globular clusters are the oldest and most compact star clusters in our galaxy , and that they are distributed throughout the halo as opposed to only in the disk .",
    "cosmic string loops arise via the interaction of infinite string segments which in turn are generated during a symmetry breaking phase transition in the early universe .",
    "cosmic strings are predicted in a large class of models of particle physics beyond the _",
    "standard model_. according to the cosmic string scaling solution @xcite , the distribution of infinite string segments is independent of the cosmic string tension @xmath0 ( which is , in the natural units we use , equal to the mass per unit length ) . as a consequence ,",
    "cosmic string loops are also formed with a number density which is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of string loops is determined by the string scaling solution , and depends on @xmath0 only through the dependence on @xmath0 of a critical loop radius @xmath1 below which the number distribution of strings becomes constant @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that if we fix the one free parameter in our theoretical model , namely the string tension @xmath0 , then the peak number density and the mass distribution are fixed .",
    "demanding that the mass distribution peaks at a value corresponding to the peak in the observed mass function of globular clusters in the milky way gave us a value of @xmath2 ( where we - as is standard in the cosmic string literature - multiplied @xmath0 by newton s gravitational constant @xmath3 in order to obtain a dimensionless number ) , a value which is below the current upper bound on @xmath4 of @xmath5 @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier work on limits on the string tension ) . at this point ,",
    "our string model had no more free parameters .",
    "interestingly , we found good agreement between the predicted and observed globular cluster mass functions .    however , in our previous study @xcite we neglected the presence of string loop velocities ( center of mass string loop velocities ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( eg . @xcite ) tell us that loops are typically born with translational velocities that are sizable fractions of the speed of light .",
    "the reason is that , since long string segments usually have relativistic speeds , then as string loops split off , the loops also gain significant velocities . when velocities are taken into considerations , accretion will not be spherically symmetric .",
    "additionally , accretion onto a moving loop may be less efficient compared to accretion onto a stationary loop .",
    "it should be noted , however , that loop velocities also undergo red - shifting , and thus slow down as the loops age .    in the following",
    ", we first review the hypothesis that globular clusters may be seeded by the cosmic string loops that arise from a string scaling solution in particle physics models with a vacuum manifold which has the topology of a circle @xcite . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we present our a first analysis of velocity effects on our model for the mass function of globular clusters .",
    "we compute a suppression factor which takes into account that loops with too large initial velocities will move a distance greater than the size of the spherical object which a stationary loop would accrete , and we incorporate this factor into the predicted overall number density to determine a new mass function .",
    "this is then compared with the observed mass distribution of globular clusters in our milky way galaxy . moving loops in fact",
    "do accrete matter , but do not give rise to a spherical distribution . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we compare the total mass from spherical and non - spherical accretion , and determine an alternative criterium for the maximal velocity of a loop that will seed a globular cluster .",
    "the resulting mass function turns out to be similar to the one derived using the first criterium .",
    "we then turn to a brief discussion of the cosmic string _",
    "rocket effect _ , another effect neglected in our previous work .",
    "we show that this effect has a negligible impact on our globular cluster study . finally , we present or conclusions in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "in this report , we will consider a one - scale model for the distribution of strings which @xcite implies that loops of initial radius @xmath6 form at an initial time @xmath7 given by @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is a constant obtained from numerical solutions @xcite .",
    "we will use the value @xmath10 .",
    "the average length of a string loop is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is taken to be @xmath13 here ; if the string loops were exactly circular @xmath12 would be @xmath14 . making use of the fast decay approximation that assumes loops decay virtually instantaneously",
    ", we have @xmath15 until the decay time .",
    "string loops oscillate and decay by the emission of gravitational radiation @xcite whose strength is parametrized by a dimensionless constant @xmath16 .",
    "loops with radius smaller than r_c(t ) = g t live less than one hubble expansion time before decaying .",
    "hence , the number density of loops is constant for @xmath17 .",
    "linear cosmological perturbation theory tells us that accretion of matter around a cosmic string loop starts at @xmath18 , the time of equal matter and radiation . at this time",
    ", the mass function of the string loop with respect to radius is dominated by loops with a critical radius @xmath19 , given by @xmath20 we will use @xmath21 . though these cosmic string loops will have decayed by the present time",
    ", the objects they seed will continue to grow .",
    "the number density at a time @xmath22 for loops formed in the radiation dominated era of such objects inside a galaxy is given by ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews on the applications of cosmic strings in cosmology ) @xmath23 the constant @xmath24 depends on the square of the average number @xmath25 of long string segments per hubble volume since two long string segments are required to form a loop .",
    "we will take @xmath26 . incorporating the zeldovich approximation @xcite ,",
    "the local number density of string loops inside a galaxy will be enhanced by a factor of @xmath27 .",
    "this factor is estimated to be @xmath28 due to accretion and virialization in each direction . in our calculations",
    ", we will use @xmath29 .",
    "assuming accretion continues to the present time , the mass which has accreted about these seed loops at the present time @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 to obtain a feeling for the meaning of this expression , let us insert the values of @xmath30 and @xmath3 .",
    "we then have @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for the solar mass .    in our analysis",
    ", we take the peak mass @xmath34 ( the mass where the observed globular cluster mass function for our milky way galaxy peaks ) to fix our only free parameter , the string tension .",
    "the mass function scales as @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( which follows directly from the string loop distribution ( [ eqn : numberdensity ] ) ) .",
    "we predict a linear decay for @xmath37 .",
    "this comes about since the loop radius distribution is constant and loops with radius smaller than @xmath19 live only a fraction of a hubble time step which scales linearly with @xmath38 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram1_2 ] , a comparison of the predicted mass function ( the solid lines ) with the observed distribution of globular clusters in the milky way ( histogram values ) complied from @xcite is made . to obtain the theoretical curve ,",
    "we take the comoving number density @xmath39 of loops ( where @xmath40 is given in ( [ eqn : numberdensity ] ) ) , multiply the result by the concentration factor @xmath27 , allow each loop to grow in mass by a factor of @xmath41 ( independent spherical accretion ) , and convert this into a mass distribution @xmath42 , while taking into account the jacobian of the transformation from @xmath38 to @xmath43 . the result",
    "is then multiplied by the bin size @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a number , and by the volume @xmath46 of the milky way galaxy .",
    "we obtain the following peak number density bin using ( [ eqn : mass ] ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the cosmological redshift at time @xmath49 .",
    "all of the calculations summarized in the this section assumed that cosmic strings loops are created and remain at rest . in the following two sections",
    ", we will study the effect of velocities ( translational center of mass motion ) through two different analyses .    in our first analysis ( discussed in the following section )",
    ", we will compute the mass function of objects which accrete onto loops with velocities low enough such that the loop center moves a smaller physical distance than the physical radius of the shell which would be collapsing onto the loop if it had been stationary .",
    "if the loop moves further than this , we assume that no globular clusters forms .    in our second analysis ( to be discussed in the next to following section ) we study the accretion of matter onto moving loops and keep only objects which are sufficiently spherical .",
    "we find that both conditions give similar resulting mass functions for globular clusters , the one from the second condition being slightly higher .    in the following analyses",
    ", we are neglecting the rocket effect which is the effect of anisotropy in the loop gravitational radiation that causes loops to accelerate as they decay .",
    "we show in section [ sec:5 ] that this is indeed a good approximation .",
    "accretion onto a cosmic string loop can be studied using the zeldovich approximation .",
    "as shown in e.g. in @xcite , the physical distance @xmath50 from the center of a string loop to the mass shell which is `` turning around '' ( i.e. becoming gravitationally bound ) at the present time @xmath30 is given by @xmath51 on the other hand , for an initial physical velocity @xmath52 , the distance a loop of radius @xmath38 has moved by the present time is @xmath53    in the present analysis we will only count the number of string loops for which r(r ) < h(r , t_0 ) , and we assume that the accretion onto faster moving loops is not effective at producing compact globular clusters .",
    "making use of ( [ eqn : h ] ) and ( [ eqn : deltar ] ) we obtain an upper bound on the initial velocity : @xmath54 taking the distribution of initial velocities in each of three spatial directions to be a step function of width @xmath55 leads to the following probability that a string loop will satisfy the condition ( [ eqn : vi_1 ] ) : @xmath56 where @xmath55 is the maximum velocity of cosmic strings determined through cosmic string evolution simulations .",
    "taking the integral of the velocity distribution from zero to the upper bound on @xmath52 , the rate of globular cluster formation becomes suppressed by a multiplicative factor @xmath57 : @xmath58 the distribution has a cutoff when @xmath59 leading to the critical radius @xmath60 : @xmath61 hence for values of @xmath62 , there is no suppression from velocity effects and for @xmath63 the suppression is given above by ( [ eqn : factor_1 ] ) .",
    "setting @xmath64 we obtain a critical @xmath65 given by @xmath66 thus , for @xmath67 we have @xmath68 and hence the mass function of predicted globular clusters from string loops will not change near the peak position compared to what was obtained in @xcite neglecting the presence of string loop velocities . on the other hand , if @xmath69 then the mass function will be suppressed near the peak position .",
    "the relation of @xmath65 and @xmath70 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph2_1_3 ] .    taking into account the suppression factor when performing the calculations outlined in section [ sec:2 ] , we obtain the following histogram of predicted number of globular clusters : @xmath71 notice that for @xmath72 , the mass scales as @xmath73 for @xmath63 . in the radius @xmath38 interval between @xmath19 and @xmath60 the mass function",
    "scales as @xmath35 as it does in the absence of velocity effects , and for masses smaller than @xmath34 , a linear decay is predicted by the same reasoning as in section [ sec:2 ] . for @xmath74 , the mass function scales as @xmath73 for @xmath75 , as @xmath76 for @xmath77 and decays linear for @xmath62 .     and @xmath65 ( [ eqn : vmaxc_1 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal axis is velocity on a linear scale and the vertical axis gives the @xmath70 on a logarithmic scale.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]            in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram2_1_1 ] , we show that varying @xmath70 shifts the peak position and amplitude of the mass for a fixed @xmath65 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "initial velocity effects are negligible . however , for @xmath79 but very close to the value of @xmath19 there is a slight suppression in the region @xmath80 from velocity effects .",
    "[ fig : histogram2_1_2 ] , we consider @xmath81 which minimizes @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram1_2 ] , we find from varying @xmath83 that for @xmath84 , velocity has little effect on mass distribution of globular clusters in the milky way galaxy .",
    "however , for @xmath85 we will not obtain a mass distribution .",
    "in the previous section we estimated the range of velocities for which spherical accretion onto a loop is a good approximation . on the other hand , accretion onto a moving loop can also be studied by means of the zeldovich approximation .",
    "this analysis is technically a bit more complicated than in the case of spherical accretion , but the study has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the result is that half of the turnaround mass from a string with some initial velocity is within a region which can be approximated by a paraboloid of radius @xmath86 and height @xmath87 ) , where ( for loops born before the time of equal matter and radiation ) [ bparameter ] b(t ) = a(t ) , where @xmath88 is the mass of the loop .",
    "note that since the accretion effectively starts at @xmath18 , it is the loop velocity @xmath89 at that time which enters the formula .",
    "the value of the mass enclosed in this region is : @xmath90 assuming that the accreted mass has uniform density , we find that density @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 approximating the other half of the accreted mass to be spherical , the total mass is given by @xmath93 comparing this to the mass from spherical accretion : @xmath94 we see non - spherical accretion results in a mass that is larger by a factor of two .",
    "accretion is roughly spherical when the loop accretion sphericity parameter @xmath95 as defined in ( [ bparameter ] ) is larger than one . in this analysis , we will consider a slightly lower bound by setting @xmath96 .",
    "using this condition , we obtain an equation for @xmath89 : @xmath97 red - shifting the velocity to the time of loop formation in the radiation dominated era we obtain : @xmath98 notice that the upper bound on the initial velocity in this analysis differs by only factor of @xmath99 from the upper bound found in the first analysis . from here , performing the same steps as in analysis 1 would obtain results that are larger by a factor @xmath99 .",
    "this can be seen clearly by determining the new @xmath65 : @xmath100 the numerical results are presented in fig .",
    "( [ fig : graph2_2_3 ] ) .     and @xmath65 ( [ eqn : vmaxc_2 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal axis is velocity on a linear scale and the vertical axis gives the @xmath70 on a logarithmic scale.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the _ rocket effect _ is an effect which causes the string loop to accelerate as a consequence of anisotropic gravitational radiation .",
    "let us assume that the string loop has a center of mass velocity @xmath89 at @xmath18 .",
    "hubble expansion will lead to a decrease in the velocity whereas the anisotropic gravitational radiation will tend to cause an increase .",
    "which effect wins depends on time .",
    "the equation of motion for the loop velocity taking into account hubble expansion and anisotropic gravitational radiation is ( see e.g. appendix a of @xcite - we have generalized the result to times before @xmath18 ) @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the coefficient of anisotropic gravitational radiation , @xmath103 is the mass at the loop formation time @xmath104 and @xmath88 is the mass at a later time .",
    "we will take @xmath105 .",
    "this value was estimated by numerical simulations using the kibble - turok loop solutions @xcite .",
    "we now ask the question whether the rocket effect can have an important effect on gravitational accretion by the loops which dominate the globular cluster mass function .",
    "thus , we are interested in loops with initial radius @xmath106 .",
    "if the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ rocket ] ) is smaller than the first term at the time @xmath107 , then we argue that the rocket effect will be negligible since even if at very late times the string loop starts to accelerate away from the initial position of the loop , the nonlinear object seeded by the loop is already in place one hubble time after @xmath18 . making use of ( [ rocket ] ) we then obtain the condition v_i ( g ) ^-1/2 > _ p ^3/2 ^-3/2 ^-3/2 , which , if satisfied , guarantees that the rocket effect is negligible .",
    "but for the values of @xmath4 smaller than the current observational bound this condition is obviously satisfied . hence , we conclude that the rocket effect does not effect our analysis .",
    "in this paper we have considered the effects of string loop velocities on the model for the explanation of the origin of globular clusters proposed in @xcite in which it is proposed that globular clusters are seeded by cosmic string loops .",
    "we see that velocities play a small , but noticeable role in the accretion of matter during the matter - dominated era .",
    "cosmic string loops , born in the radiation era at @xmath7 with initial velocity @xmath52 will travel a certain given by ( [ eqn : deltar ] ) . demanding that this distance be smaller than the total size of the structure which accretes around a static loop , denoted in this paper by @xmath108 , leads to an upper bound on the string velocities . in our analysis 1",
    "we assumed that loops with larger velocities do not give rise to globular clusters .",
    "we computed the corrections to the mass function obtained using this hypothesis , as a function of the maximal velocity of string loops .",
    "our theory predicts a cutoff velocity . for velocities smaller than @xmath65 ,",
    "velocity effects are negligible .    an improved analysis ( analysis 2 ) can be obtained by taking into account the non - spherical accretion of matter about a moving string loop , and demanding that the resulting nonlinear object is sufficiently spherical .",
    "the results of this analysis were very similar to those obtained using analysis 1 .      aside from globular clusters , it is noteworthy to mention that analyses discussed in this report may also be applied to ultra - compact - mini - halos , as they too can be manifestations of cosmic string loop accretion @xcite .",
