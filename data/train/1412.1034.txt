    "careful studies  @xcite of the 122-feas family of superconductors strongly suggest that sc peaks at a hitherto enigmatic quantum critical point , identified as the @xmath12 endpoint of the orthorhombic - tetragonal ( o - t ) structural transition",
    ". corroborating evidence for a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , tacitly assumed to be an afm - qcp based on a weak - correlation analysis , is also provided by transport and nmr  @xcite , and by electronic raman scattering  @xcite data .",
    "both orbital - driven and spin - driven nematic orders have been proposed as the primary order parameter of the normal phase . however , distinguishing between these views in feas systems is complicated by the close proximity of structural ( related to @xmath13 ) and afm transitions ( @xmath10 ) : they either occur simultaneously  @xcite or very close together , with @xmath14 ( thus afm always occurs in the orthorhombic phase ) .",
    "it is impossible to distinguish between them on purely symmetry grounds : both views involve breaking of the same ( discrete rotational ) @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "while more tests are needed to resolve this issue , a microscopic approach can be very useful here .",
    "motivated thus , we undertake a joint theoretical - experimental study to illuminate these issues .",
    "we adopt a strong - correlation perspective constrained by the above observations .",

    ", we also analyze extant results for ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath4as@xmath4 in this picture .",
    "our main finding is an onset of an orbital selective mott transition ( osmt ) near optimal doping , signaled by the appearance of a pole in the @xmath17-orbital self - energy at @xmath18 .",
    "this naturally explains the near - insulating behavior along the orthorhombic @xmath19 direction observed experimentally .",
    "the possibility of an osmt in pnictides has been proposed earlier based on bandstructure calculations@xcite as well as in the context of iron selenides@xcite using a slave - spin technique .",
    "to get deeper insight , we construct a landau - ginzburg - wilson model a non - analytic functional of the orbital nematic order parameter for describing the competing interactions between superconductivity and nematic order parameters , and discuss their effects on the nature of transitions between different phases in 122-feas .",
    "we use single crystals of sr - co-122 grown from feas self - flux to study the evolution of transport anisotropy similar to previous experiments  @xcite . crystals of dimensions of approximately 3 mm x 4mmx 1 mm were obtained .",
    "the crystals grow naturally with the flat surface of the crystal perpendicular to the tetragonal c - axis .",

    "the orthorhombic unit cell is rotated by @xmath20 with respect to the tetragonal unit cell .",
    "the crystal was oriented and parallel cuts were made perpendicular to the [ 110 ] tetragonal direction so that a rectangular shaped crystal was obtained .",
    "a clamp capable of providing uniaxial pressure was designed for the purpose of detwinning .",
    "the clamp was made of hysol and had brass screws with a stainless steel spring which provided a force of 20 n when completely compressed , which resulted in a force of 1.75 n per pitch of the screw .",
    "this translated to a pressure of about 5 - 10 mpa on the sample which was placed carefully between the front two pieces of the clamp assembly .",
    "four probe contacts were made using 50 micron gold wire .",
    "circuitworks cw2400 was used for making the initial contact and was heat treated for better mechanical strength .",
    "epolead 4929 silver epoxy was then used for making good electrical connection .",
    "the contact resistance was around 2 ohms .",
    "a continuous flow cryostat was used to do the resistance measurements .",
    "an ac signal source of frequency 77 hz supplied a current of 50 microamps and the voltage was measured using a princeton instruments e g & g lock - in amplifier .",

    "although the resistivities are different along the two directions below the sdw transition , they are both still metallic . with doping the transition",
    "is shifted to lower temperatures and vanishes beyond a doping of 8.1 % , whereas superconductivity appears around 7.6 % .",

    "@xcite the anisotropy becomes maximum just prior to the onset of sc and the value is very similar to that obtained in the ba analogue ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparison ) .",
    "however the splitting between the structural and sdw is not prominent as other cases . ]",
    "several features stand out : @xmath31 the resistivity anisotropy @xmath32 is in the opposite direction to the lattice anisotropy @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 evolves non - monotonically , peaking in the vicinity of 6% doping and disappearing beyond 8% doping ( i.e. ) close to @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath35 acquires a finite value significantly above @xmath11 , in accord with earlier finding , and @xmath38 anomalous transport ( bad - metallic @xmath39 ohm - cm at low @xmath8 even for @xmath40 ) is enhanced with doping , with @xmath41 even showing insulator - like @xmath8-dependence below @xmath42  k , depending on @xmath5 , while @xmath43 exhibits enhanced bad - metallicity .",
    "this trend is quite intriguing , as a naive expectation mandates enhanced ( `` good '' ) metallicity upon doping .    taken together with earlier data for ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath4as@xmath4 , the intriguing features are indicative of an unusual qcp involving electronic nematic ( en ) order , situated around @xmath44 where sc is maximized .",
    "however , the insulating temperature - dependence of @xmath45 also indicates an orbital - selective mott transition ( of electronic states contributing to @xmath45 ) at work , and the loss of both these features in the overdoped regime suggests localization physics in a possible en qcp scenario .",
    "we posit that this localization is not a disorder effect but rather an indicator of an osmt , a view supported by recent analysis that finds transport anisotropy to be an intrinsic feature of the renormalized electronic structure  @xcite .",
    "in addition , criticality associated with divergence of the nematic susceptibility shows `` clean '' critical exponents  @xcite , suggesting irrelevance of disorder .",
    "while a correct sign of @xmath35 can apparently be rationalized within both spin - nematic  @xcite and ferro - orbital en  @xcite scenarios , the insulator - like behavior of @xmath46 over a wide range of @xmath5 can be very naturally understood from an osmt view .",
    "given that a unified view of the data suggests an intrinsic band- ( orbital ) selective localization tendency at work  @xcite , we consider this possibility in more detail as well as its ramifications for an en qcp scenario in 122-feas systems .",
    "we note that the even more strongly correlated features visible in fese@xmath1te@xmath2  @xcite also make it a good candidate for our proposal .",
    "to substantiate the link between osmt and an electronic nematic qcp , we have performed first - principles local density approximation plus dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft ) calculations following earlier work by two of us  @xcite .",
    "the five-@xmath47 bands of fe , computed by the linear muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) method , were used as inputs in a multi - orbital dmft formalism . the multi - orbital iterated perturbation theory ( mo - ipt )",
    "was used as an impurity solver in dmft : though not exact , it is a computationally fast and effective solver , and has been shown to work quantitatively in a variety of contexts  @xcite .",

    "for the parent @xmath58 system although there is split in the response both the directions show metallic behavior as is also noticed in experiments .",
    "the inset shows the resistivity for different values of doping in the absence of the osmt  @xcite . ]",
    "the osmt directly implies insulator - like resistivity along @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the calculated resistivities along @xmath59 , computed from the full dmft green functions at finite-@xmath8 .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath31 at @xmath40 , bad metallic resistivity at low @xmath8 and maximal anisotropy at @xmath9 persists above @xmath9 , as found before  @xcite , and @xmath34 @xmath35 increases at low @xmath8 as @xmath5 increases .",

    "the actual resistivity data near optimal doping is sensitive to superconducting fluctuation effects , and @xmath25 does not , at first sight , appear to follow an arrhenius law we expect from a mott insulator .",
    "this is indeed the case at intermediate @xmath8 , but at lower @xmath8 , this gives way to a form characteristic of strong superconducting fluctuations .",
    "to separate the effect of superconducting fluctuations , we have fitted the resistivity data near @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ supfig1])to the well - known halperin - nelson interpolation formula , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 here , @xmath67 while @xmath68 @xmath19 and @xmath69 are fitting parameters .",
    "the arrhenius behavior in the normal state and the kosterlitz - thouless like behavior near @xmath0 is typically seen in a superconductor - insulator transition driven by phase fluctuations .     as can be seen in the bottom panel , and simultaneously increases the insulating behavior . ]",
    "together with recent evidence for precursor diamagnetism  @xcite in 122-systems , this finding further supports selective - mottness setting in around @xmath70 as a natural contender for possible quantum criticality .",
    "the key point is that from the number - phase uncertainty principle , an osmt immediately implies a strong phase fluctuation - dominated regime for a subsequent sc instability . since both @xmath71 states are microscopically implicated in the @xmath72 sc pairing , mott localization of ( a subset ) @xmath17 carriers in the `` normal '' state",
    "must now necessarily implicate large phase fluctuations above @xmath73 , precisely as indicated by the hn fit .",
    "in addition , we also find that an external magnetic field leads to a _ positive _ magnetoresistance ( mr ) ( which enhances the insulator - like @xmath45 for all @xmath74 ) , while conventional negative mr is recovered for @xmath75 , further supporting the hypothesis of a qcep associated with osmt around @xmath44 . without any additional assumptions ,",
    "osmt also stabilizes foo and associated en by enhancing(reducing ) @xmath76 relative to their para - orbital values .",
    "thus , the en qcp is intimately tied down to the osmt , and is thus expected to have an underlying mott - like criticality .",
    "the existence of the putative electron - nematic qcp , now linked to an osmt , at @xmath44 corresponding to maximum @xmath73 naturally leads us to ask : what role do these coupled criticalities play in near - optimally doped fe - arsenides ? since both electronic nematicity and superconducting instabilities result from the same residual interaction , how do we describe the competition between the two phases ?    clearer physical insight into these issues is gained by constructing a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) functional for the competing `` normal''-sc and `` normal '' metal - en metal transitions .",
    "compared to previous work  @xcite , a novel feature of our phenomenology is that lgw parameters for different @xmath5 are computed from the lda+dmft incoherent spectral functions ( see below ) rather than from lda  @xcite .",
    "the osmt in the @xmath17 sector corresponds to a pocket - vanishing lifshitz transition with consequent ferro - orbital and electronic nematic instabilities ( for which arpes evidence indeed exists ) , whence we define the en order parameter @xmath77 , with the free energy expansion  @xcite , @xmath78=a n + b_{\\mu}n^{2 } + c_{\\mu}n^{3 } + d_{\\mu}n^{4}.$ ] here , following yamaji _",

    "@xcite ) now shows that a line of first - order transitions ( for @xmath118 , where @xmath119 jumps discontinuously ) ends at a _ marginal _ quantum critical end - point ( m - qcep ) ( @xmath120 ) , beyond which ( @xmath121 ) only a smooth crossover is obtained . if @xmath99 the stabilizing term @xmath122 is needed and the phase diagram differs from the @xmath116 case .",
    "the key difference is that a first order transition to the en phase is possible even as @xmath121 .",

    "nematic susceptibility , @xmath148 ( i.e , the critical exponent , @xmath149 ) as the lifshitz point is approached from the disordered state .",
    "such a  curie - weiss  behavior has indeed been observed in strain response  @xcite and raman  @xcite data .",

    "the divergence of @xmath152 in raman data at @xmath153 can be explained by this picture given that the raman study unveils the strain - free nematic scale .",
    "we note that in this picture , the shift between @xmath154 is a consequence of coupling of strain to an _ intrinsic _ en state ( `` zeeman '' field on an ising - like orbital nematic ) , and does not necessarily require that additional ( spin nematic ) mechanisms are needed ( appendix [ a3 ] contains a discussion of strain - nematic coupling and finite - temperature behavior ) .",
    "it must be emphasized , though , that onset of orbital nematicity will induce a spin - nematic purely on symmetry grounds . while both states break the same @xmath15 lattice rotational symmetry of the @xmath8-phase , an osmt - induced en state can naturally account for the data unlike extant spin - nematic scenarios .",
    "we emphasize that , on pure symmetry grounds , our lgw functional is entirely consistent with the alternative spin - nematic view  @xcite .",

    "a crucially important consequence of our work is its implications for the stripe - afm order _ subsequent _ or co - incident with the structural transition .",
    "since an osmt is involved in the ( avoided ) quantum criticality , the fermi pocket corrsponding to @xmath6 orbital character must undergo a drastic topological modification . in a way similar to what happens in the fractionalized fermi liquid in the fl@xmath155 view  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath6 hole pocket now corresponds to _ zeros _ , rather than poles of @xmath156 .",
    "further since the @xmath157 degeneracy is now non - existent and there are no landau quasiparticles in our selective - mott state , afm order itself can no longer arise via conventional nesting instabilities of a bare or renormalized band structure .",
    "in summary , our lda+dmft+lgw analysis explains a broad set of experimental observations and unearths the hitherto unidentified link between soft quasi - local and dualistic electronic fluctuations .",
    "their combined occurrence at the en - qcp is identified as a consequence of an underlying marginal quantum critical point at a lifshitz transition , now associated with an osmt .",
    "our theory naturally accounts for a range of additional unusual responses in the best - studied 122-feas systems . in the selective - mott view ,",
    "vanishing of a fermi surface pocket as the lifshitz transition is approached from the overdoped side corresponds to a vanishing of an effective coherent bandwidth and a diverging effective mass , now associated with the @xmath17 carriers , as seen in elastic data .",
    "an osmt also naturally rationalizes electrical transport data , implicating an underlying selective mott localization in the observed insulating behaviour of @xmath158 finally , the now orbital dependent super - exchanges along @xmath159 and @xmath19 also readily lead to a @xmath160 model via a kugel - khomskii mechanism ( now justified ipso facto from selective - mottness induced local moments ) with @xmath161 and @xmath162  @xcite _ and _ @xmath163 .",
    "this qualitatively accords with the stripe - af order , as well as the spin - wave spectrum in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) studies  @xcite .    the anomalously soft electronic fluctuations accompanying a divergent electronic compressibility close to such a qcep emerges as a novel electronic pairing mechanism that can boost superconductivity by removing the residual entropy of the `` normal '' state incoherent fluctuating liquid .",

    "the upshot is that coupling to a jahn - teller or a uniaxial strain term , @xmath166 ( spin indices are suppressed ) now lowers the @xmath6 band by @xmath167 and raises the @xmath7 band by the same amount .",
    "this mechanism thus offers a simple way of visualising the relative shift of the @xmath165 bands needed to achieve consistency with the arpes fs well above @xmath11 , and it is important to emphasise that it is intimately linked to ferro orbital order and resultant ( orbital ) nematicity .",
    "it is also precisely this coupling which results in terms odd in @xmath119 in the lgw free energy used in the main text .    using the dmft local spectral functions of the five - band hubbard model",
    ", we determined the coefficients @xmath168 and @xmath169 needed to compute the co - efficients in @xmath144 by following yamaji _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and linearising the dmft spectra around @xmath18 at and away from the lifshitz point .",
    "since the en instability is primarily associated with foo and lifting of the @xmath165 orbital degeneracy , we used only the dmft results for the @xmath71 bands , computed from the full five - orbital problem .",
    "the relevant formulae are similar to those appearing in yamaji _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath170 are used in the lifshitz free energy @xmath171 and used to derive the main conclusions of the first part in this work .",
    "we emphasise that this procedure yields non - analytic co - efficients used in eq.(1 ) , and , in contrast to pure phenomenological works , are now _ derived _ from the correlated electronic structure ( dmft ) input . in another crucial difference with other phenomenological approaches ,",
    "the non - analytic co - efficients in the lgw expansion are a non - trivial consequence of the underlying selective - mott physics found in lda+dmft .",
    "we begin with the @xmath165 orbitally degenerate situation in the tetragonal phase . as in generic orbital degenerate problems ,",
    "a symmetry adapted jahn - teller term will lift this degeneracy , inducing orbital order along with a structural distortion to an orthorhombic state . in fe arsenides , this ferro - orbital order results in a preferential occupation of the @xmath6 orbital and a finite orbital nematic order parameter , @xmath173 . the jahn - teller ( or orbital - lattice ) coupling is    @xmath174    in the planar geometry of the feas systems , @xmath175 is related to the orthorhombicity , @xmath176 ( where @xmath59 are unit cell lattice constants ) . in the lgw",
    "functional , the orbital - lattice coupling thus induces an extra term @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is determined by minimising    @xmath179    with respect to @xmath180 . here ,",
    "@xmath181 an effective `` spring constant '' related to the details of the phonon spectrum .",
    "this yields @xmath182 , and resubstituting this into @xmath183 yields the extra term @xmath184 which renormalises @xmath185 as stated in the main text .",
    "the importance of this effect is seen from the fact that @xmath19 can now change sign , as is needed to derive a line of first - order ( now nematic - plus - structural ) transitions separated from the region of a smooth crossover by a quantum critical end - point where the exotic marginal quantum criticality obtains .",
    "here we detail the finite-@xmath8 gl theory for orbital - nematic order coupled to strain , to simulate the actual physical situation in experimental studies . more specifically ,",
    "we couple the free energy for the pocket - vanishing lifshitz transition ,                  thus , in presence of strain the nematic suseptibility diverges at @xmath195 . also , above the structural transition",
    ", we can neglect terms @xmath196 , to get @xmath197 .",
    "finally , in our mean - field picture of the transition , we assume that @xmath198 has the usual @xmath8-dependence , i.e , that @xmath199 , with @xmath200 at @xmath201 the @xmath5-dependence comes from lda+dmft results as discussed before .",
    "thus , the finite-@xmath8 nematic susceptibility is now @xmath202 whence it follows that finite @xmath203 occur simultaneously at a _",
    "renormalized _ temperature , @xmath204 .",
    "the intrinsic nematic mean - field transition scale is thus _ lower _ than that at which the structural transition occurs ( at @xmath9 ) .",
    "physically , this arises because strain acts as a conjugate field to the nematic order parameter , and so enhances intrinsic nematicity .",
    "it also offers a natural explanation of the _ shift _ between the structural transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) and the temperature where resistivity anisotropy is maximum _ in the normal state _ , as seen from the @xmath205 phase diagram .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that , in electronic raman scattering data  @xcite , the extrapolated charge susceptibility diverges at a @xmath206 lower than @xmath9 : this is now simply because there is no strain effect in raman studies , which may consequently be unearthing the intrinsic @xmath207 .",
    "finally , it is also the reason for apparently different conclusionsin literature , where measurements under strain - tuning find that the en phase persists into the overdoped region in the @xmath205 phase diagram : strain stabilizes en order but washes out nematic ( quantum ) criticality , while raman measurements , not carried out under strain , reveal the intrinsic nematic scale @xmath208 ."
