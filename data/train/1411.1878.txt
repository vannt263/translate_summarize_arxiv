    "the electroweak theory , combining two fundamental interactions  the electromagnetic and weak forces  was introduced by salam , glashow and weinberg in the 1960s  @xcite .",
    "it explains the nuclear beta - decay and weak effects in high - energy physics .",
    "one of the most prominent properties of the electroweak theory is the spatial parity violation ( pv ) .",
    "this unique phenomenon distinguishes the weak interaction from the electromagnetic one , therefore , it helps to investigate weak properties on an electromagnetic background .",
    "firstly , pv was experimentally detected in the beta decay of @xmath2co by wu  @xcite and collaborators .",
    "later , many other novel experiments for the pv observation have been proposed and performed .",
    "low - energy pv experiments in atomic physics were carried out with cs atoms ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the pv effect has been theoretically predicted to have a measurable influence on the vibrational spectrum of molecules in ref .",
    "investigations of pv effects enable tests of the standard model of elementary particle physics and impose constraints on physics beyond this model . the search for new efficient ways to re - examine and investigate the pv phenomenon",
    "is an ongoing research activity ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "another physical situation where pv effects can play a noticeable role is the interaction of electrons with the crystal lattice of nuclei in the solid state  @xcite .",
    "while the relative contribution of the pv effect is lower in comparison to other investigation methods , pv experiments with solids are of interest because of the compact size of the experimental equipment .",
    "possible solid - state systems where one may study the pv contribution are superconductors ( sc ) .",
    "such systems would enable to study the macroscopic manifestation of a quantum effect such as the electroweak interaction .",
    "the idea that pv effects can appear in scs has been suggested by vainstein and khriplovich  @xcite .",
    "they have realized that the electroweak contribution is insignificantly small in conventional @xmath3-wave scs .",
    "however , it was predicted  @xcite , that the effect can be increased by using scs of other types , e.g. @xmath0-wave scs .",
    "nowadays different unconventional scs can be created and are well understood  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we estimate this effect to be observed in @xmath0-wave ferromagnetic scs , and put forward a novel method for its observation and control . our calculations yield a relative contribution of pv enhanced by several orders of magnitude as compared to the @xmath3-wave case .",
    "the pv effect may still not be strong enough to be immediately measurable , however , the results of this manuscript open the way for further enhancements of the signature of pv .",
    "the sc system for studying pv considered in the present work is a circular josephson junction in an external magnetic field .",
    "this system is described , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite and consists of a circular sc with two insulating junctions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jj ] ) .",
    "if the circular josephson junction is placed in an external magnetic field , the maximal value of the sc current depends periodically on the magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "this dependence is symmetric under the reflection of the direction of the magnetic flux .",
    "however , the presence of the pv terms in the electron - nucleus interaction breaks this symmetry .",
    "we investigate this effect in the case of unconventional @xmath0-wave scs .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the description of the pv effect in solid state ( ii .",
    "a ) , and present the possible superconducting system , namely , a circular josephson junction ( ii .",
    "b ) . in section iii , we develop a method for the possible observation and control of the pv effect ( iii .",
    "a ) , and evaluate the magnitude of the pv effect for a certain sc , namely , uranium digermanide , uge@xmath1 ( iii .",
    "b ) . in subsection iii .",
    "c , we construct and solve the equations for the coexistence of the ferromagnetic and superconducting phases .",
    "section iv discusses a scheme for a further improvement of the measurement technique , which can lead to a significant enhancement of the pv effect .",
    "finally , we provide a quantitative prediction of the pv effect in the system considered .",
    "the weak odd - parity interaction in a crystal is given by the operator@xcite @xmath4\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the fermi constant  @xcite , @xmath6 is the nuclear charge of crystal ions , @xmath7 stands for the electron mass , @xmath8 is the weak charge , and @xmath9 denotes the momentum of a cooper pair .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 stands for the nuclear spin , @xmath11 is the pre - factor of the weak interaction of electrons with nuclear spins  @xcite .",
    "the summation goes over the crystal sites , determined by the position vectors @xmath12 .",
    "it is obvious from this equation that if the pair spin is zero , @xmath13 ( @xmath3- or @xmath14-wave ) , only the second term is non - vanishing .",
    "this case has been investigated before in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the @xmath0-wave case",
    "@xcite , the first term is also nonzero , and its approximate magnitude is @xmath6-times larger than that of the other terms .",
    "now , we describe our case of interest ( @xmath15 ) in analogy with the @xmath13 case  @xcite .",
    "the first term of the effective interaction is  @xcite @xmath16\\,,\\ ] ] where the weak charge is @xmath17 expressed with the factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the cabibbo weak mixing angle  @xcite is given by @xmath20 . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the density and mass number of nuclei , respectively , and @xmath23 is the enhancement factor of relativistic effects at small distances  @xcite , where @xmath24 , @xmath25  fm is the nuclear radius , @xmath26 denotes the bohr radius , and @xmath27 denotes the gamma function of real argument .",
    "@xmath28 is on the order of 10 for heavy elements .",
    "the effective term ( [ eq : weff ] ) has to be added to the standard electromagnetic lagrangian : @xmath29 where we use relativistic units .",
    "for the momentum of an electron one obtains @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the effective mass of the electron .",
    "the mass ration @xmath32 can exceed @xmath33 .",
    "the above weak modification of the electron momentum is equivalent to the substitution @xmath34 to be performed in all equations .",
    "we apply this substitution in the description of a superconducting ring .    considering the case",
    "when the external magnetic field does not penetrate into the sc , one can obtain the following expression for the magnetic flux in the superconducting ring : @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 this result can be used in any applications and for any sc systems . in the following section",
    "we apply this for the circular josephson junction .",
    "let us discuss now the loop integral in eq .",
    "[ eqn : pv_f ] . in the case of @xmath0-waves ,",
    "the pairing spin is @xmath15 .",
    "however , the integral @xmath38 is non - zero only if the mean spin vector ( averaged over the whole sc circle ) is non - zero .",
    "therefore , it is advisable to use an unconventional sc , which possesses a superconducting phase in coexistence with the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "it allows one to control the effect by inducing magnetization in the sc .",
    "furthermore , because of the @xmath39 scaling of the weak flux @xmath40 , it is advantageous to employ heavy - element scs .",
    "a possible material with these properties is uranium digermanide , uge@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "our suggested experimental setup for the observation of the pv effect in sc is a circular josephson junction ( jj ) .",
    "a linear jj is created by two scs , separated by a thin insulator material .",
    "it was predicted by josephson @xcite that the insulator does not prevent the appearance of a superconducting current , however , the properties of the current depend on the thickness and material of this insulator .",
    "nowadays jjs have a wide spectrum of applications connected with atomic physics and quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "we consider the point - contact limit of the jj , i.e. we assume that the insulator is infinitely thin .",
    "however , all derivations presented here can be easily extended for other jj models , since the pv effect breaks the symmetry in any case .",
    "the current in the jj in the point contact approximation is given by the expression  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle - averaged transmission probability , and @xmath43 stands for the gap parameter .",
    "the phase is defined by @xmath44 where the integral is to be taken across the junction  @xcite and @xmath45 is an unknown constant phase .",
    "this expression is valid both in the clean and dirty limits of the sc .",
    "if one now constructs a circular jj by two identical jj @xmath46 and @xmath47 connected in parallel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jj ] ) , only the following phase difference between these junctions is observable : @xmath48 where the circular integral is to be taken along the loop , and thus @xmath49 .",
    "as noted above , we can only control the phase difference , thus one can write , following ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the total current in the circular jj as a function of the magnetic flux is then given by the expression @xmath52\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression still depends on the arbitrary phase @xmath45 .",
    "one may however determine the maximal value of the current @xmath53 .",
    "the behavior of the maximal current can be calculated numerically for a certain gap parameter @xmath43 and a diffusion parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath54 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : jmax ] for the values @xmath55 ( in units of temperature ) and @xmath56 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath57 is invariant under the change of the sign of @xmath57 . due to the presence of the the weak odd - parity interaction ,",
    "as shown in the previous section , one has to substitute @xmath57 in all equations as @xmath58 where @xmath40 is the positive admixture of the weak parity - violating term .",
    "thus the real dependence of the maximal current on the magnetic flux is given by @xmath59 and it is not symmetric with respect to the change of the sign of @xmath57 . the main purpose of this work is to present the case in which this asymmetry can be measured . in the following sections we discuss the calculation and a possible measurement method for the value of @xmath40 .",
    "it can be challenging to directly observe the small asymmetry of the dependence of @xmath60 on @xmath54 , therefore , we suggest to employ a time - periodic magnetic field instead of a static one .",
    "as mentioned before , one can compute the phase - independent maximal josephson current @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the first positive root of this expression .",
    "if we now introduce a periodic component to the magnetic field , @xmath63 @xmath64 also depends periodically on time with the period @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the angular frequency of the oscillating field",
    ". roots of this function are reached every half of the period , i.e. with a @xmath67 periodicity .",
    "the typical shape of this function , calculated for the case of @xmath61 shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : jmax ] , is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : jper1 ] .",
    "let us now incorporate the weak interaction into this system .",
    "one can see that the weak interaction can be controlled ( `` switched on / off '' ) by introducing the magnetization in our sc ferromagnetic circular jj , since the pv contribution is proportional to the average spin of the cooper pairs [ see the integral of the spin over a circle in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pv_f ] ) ] .",
    "the periodic field coefficient @xmath46 is chosen to be greater than the weak factor @xmath40 , however , it is comparable to it : @xmath68    now the roots of @xmath64 are not exactly @xmath67-periodic any more . this behavior is shown on fig .  [",
    "fig : jper2 ] .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath69 , the roots become almost @xmath70 - periodic .",
    "this non - periodic behavior of roots can be observed experimentally , since it can be dynamically controlled by the periodic magnetic field .    as an alternative",
    ", one may also do the measurement at some certain phase @xmath45 rather than at a maximal josephson current . here",
    "we can introduce again the oscillations of the magnetic field around the first root @xmath62 of the total current @xmath71 . in this case , the current changes its sign during the total period @xmath65 .",
    "if we take @xmath72 after switching on the weak interaction , with magnetization being present in the sc , the total current function will be always of the same sign , as it is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : jper3 ] .      in the present section",
    "we evaluate the value of the admixture @xmath40 to the magnetic flux through the jj ring [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : pv_phi2f ] ) ,  ( [ eqn : pv_f ] ) ] to provide an estimate of the magnitude of the pv effect in scs .    in the case of a ferromagnetic sc we can assume that pairs are polarized along the loop , therefore , their polarization can have two different opposite directions .",
    "this assumption yields for the loop integral @xmath73 with the mean spin value @xmath74 , which has to be determined by a self - consistent solution of the equations for superconductivity and ferromagnetism in this material .",
    "this is performed in the following section .",
    "now we give an estimation of the pv effect .",
    "the pv admixture @xmath40 is expressed with the mean spin @xmath74 as @xmath75 assuming a round jj , the loop integral simply yields @xmath76 , the mean spin value @xmath74 is to be calculated in the next section , and the remaining factors are known : @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the relativistic enhancement parameter is @xmath79 , the value of the effective mass at the ambient pressure is in the interval  @xcite @xmath80 , thus we may assume @xmath81 the density of nuclei is  @xcite @xmath82 .",
    "then , in dimensionless units ( @xmath83 ) , the final value of @xmath40 is @xmath84 where the length @xmath85 is measured in units of cm .",
    "this result is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the value of the admixture factor in the case of an @xmath3-wave heavy sc  @xcite . to observe this effect one may use the method with the oscillating magnetic field , as described in the previous section",
    "since the flux , in units of @xmath86 , is given by @xmath87 the time - dependent part of the magnetic field is determined by @xmath88 in case of @xmath89 , the expression for the amplitude @xmath90 , in units of tesla is [ cf .",

    "we discuss this result in the concluding section after showing in the following that @xmath74 can indeed reach its maximal value , @xmath95 .      for the calculation of the mean spin value  @xmath74 of cooper pairs we use a model for the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism of ref .",
    "@xcite , described there for the case of an isotropic material .",
    "we extended this formalism for anisotropic materials .",

    "the stoner parameter depends on the pressure , but it is independent of the temperature . in the ferromagnetic phase , only the pairs with spins parallel to the field can exist .",
    "we introduce two gap parameters @xmath109 for spins in the direction of magnetization @xmath110 and in the opposite direction @xmath111 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the matsubara green s functions @xcite for this hamiltonian are constructed , and , after summation over matsubara frequencies , the equations are obtained for the magnetization , number of particles and gap parameters . by replacing all summations by continuum integrals in dimensionless energy units , rescaled by the factor @xmath112 , one receives the equations @xmath113 where the following quantities have been introduced : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "the integration over the variables @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 corresponds to an integration over the three - dimensional momentum of the pair .",

    "( [ eqn : pv_b1 ] ) , together with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pv_b2 ] ) , presents the gap equation for pairs polarized in or opposite to the direction of the magnetization .",
    "finally , eq .  ( [ eqn : pv_c ] ) expresses the conservation of the number of pairs .    in an isotropic case , considered before in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relation @xmath121 holds .",
    "however , for anisotropic materials , during the change of the summation over @xmath122 to three dimensional integration , the angular integrals in spherical coordinates remain the same , however , the radial variables are changed : @xmath123 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath124 being the crystal cell parameters .",
    "thus , we have 3 integrals over @xmath125 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which change to integrals over @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and the energy in all equations depends on the angles : @xmath126 finally , we arrive to 4 equations , eqs .",
