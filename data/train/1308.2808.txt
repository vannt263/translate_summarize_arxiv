    "frames and gabor riesz sequences arise in many engineering contexts .",
    "the corresponding series expansions can be interpreted as a sum of local fourier series , the coefficients carry simultaneous information about time and frequency .",
    "therefore they are an appropriate tool whenever simultaneous time - frequency information is required .",
    "thus gabor frame expansions are used naturally in speech processing and in the analysis of music signals  @xcite , though often under names as phase vocoder or lapped fourier transform .",
    "one of the principal uses of gabor expansions arises in wireless digital transmission with ofdm  @xcite .",
    "a non - exhaustive list of further applications includes antenna analysis  @xcite , the analysis of ultrasound imaging  @xcite , of brain stem responses  @xcite , and even for the ( texture ) analysis of images  @xcite .",
    "a gabor family consists of time - frequency shifts of a single window function @xmath0 ( often called pulse in wireless communications ) over a lattice @xmath1 .",
    "formally , let @xmath0 be a square - integrable function on @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the lattice parameters , then the time - frequency shifts are defined as @xmath4 , @xmath5 . in a concrete problem one",
    "is asked to design a pulse @xmath0 and choose the time - frequency spacing @xmath6 in such a way that the corresponding set of functions possesses required properties .",
    "basic requirements on the pulse are often explicit formulas and good time - frequency concentration , basic requirements on the set of functions @xmath7 are its spanning properties . if one needs a stable expansion of _ every _ signal with respect to the time - frequency shifts @xmath8 , one has to construct a gabor frame ( weyl - heisenberg frame ) . in wireless communications",
    "one needs the set @xmath9 to be linearly independent and thus has to construct a gabor riesz basis for a proper subspace of @xmath10 .",
    "currently only few explicit pulse shapes are used .",
    "the gaussian function @xmath11 is used in antenna analysis  @xcite or for the compression of eeg signals  @xcite .",
    "the rectangular pulse is much in favor in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( odfm ) with cyclic prefix  @xcite ; the raised cosine window is the standard window in speech processing and the analysis of music signals . a representative list of windows for discrete gabor frames is contained in sondergaard s large time - frequency analysis toolbox ltfat  @xcite . in pulse - shaping ofdm",
    "@xcite pulses are constructed to satisfy certain optimality criteria , but they are usually not given explicitly .",
    "once one has chosen a suitable pulse , one needs to determine which shift parameters generate a gabor frame or basis .",
    "the density theory of gabor frames  @xcite asserts that the time - frequency  plane must be oversampled for @xmath12 to be a frame , i.e. @xmath13 , whereas for a riesz sequence one needs undersampling @xmath14 . for the case of critical sampling @xmath15 one can construct orthonormal bases of time - frequency shifts , but the corresponding pulse always lacks time - frequencyconcentration  @xcite , as can already be seen for the rectangular pulse .    in many applications",
    "it is desirable to operate as close to the critical density as possible . for a large channel capacity",
    "a gabor riesz sequence should span a `` large '' subspace of @xmath10 and thus @xmath16 for some small @xmath17 .",
    "likewise , to avoid large redundancy of the frame expansion , the density of a gabor frame should be @xmath18 for small @xmath19 .",
    "these fundamental requirements pose a difficult and largely unanswered question .",
    "once a pulse shape is chosen , it is not at all clear whether such a choice of lattice parameters close to the critical density is possible . until recently the complete set of the lattice parameters generating a gabor frame was understood only for a handful of pulse shapes , namely the gaussian , the hyperbolic secant , and two exponential functions  @xcite . on the other hand , for the popular rectangular pulse",
    "the determination of good lattice parameters is extremely complicated , as is shown by janssen s tie  @xcite .    to this day , it remains a challenging mathematical problem to determine suitable lattice parameters @xmath20 for which the corresponding gabor family @xmath21 is a frame or a riesz sequence .",
    "perhaps this lack of theoretical understanding has prevented the use of other pulses in engineering applications .    in this paper",
    "we propose totally positive functions as convenient and universal windows for gabor frames .",
    "the goal is to offer practitioners of time - frequency analysis  a new , large class of pulse shapes for which the frame property is easy to determine for _ all _ lattice parameters .",
    "our contribution is based on recent progress in the mathematical analysis of gabor frames . in  @xcite",
    ", the following result was shown .",
    "a function @xmath0 is said to be totally positive of finite type @xmath22 ( tpfft ) , if its fourier transform @xmath23 factors as follows : let @xmath24 , @xmath25 be a finite set of nonzero real numbers , then @xmath26    [ thm : grst13-main ] let @xmath27 be a totally positive function of finite type @xmath28 .",
    "then the gabor family @xmath29 constitutes a frame if and only if @xmath30 .",
    "moreover the gabor frame possesses a compactly supported , piecewise continuous dual window @xmath31 .    by duality",
    ", the gabor family @xmath21 is a riesz sequence for the generated subspace , if and only if @xmath32 .",
    "this result provides a family of pulse shapes that is parametrized by a countable number of parameters @xmath24 . by choosing suitable",
    "@xmath24 one can finetune the pulse to one s needs .",
    "we will make this result more useful for applications in signal processing and for numerical use by deriving similar statements for gabor frames for discrete signals , for continuous periodic signals , and for finite discrete signals . in these cases",
    "the hilbert space is @xmath33 , or @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 $ ] denotes the interval from @xmath37 to @xmath38 on the real line , or @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( instead of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the choice of totally positive functions of finite type as a pulse shape for gabor frames has several major advantages .    1",
    ".   totally positive functions of finite type ( tpfft ) are universal pulse shapes that generate a gabor frame whenever the time frequency plane is oversampled and that generate a gabor riesz sequence whenever the time - frequency  plane is undersampled .",
    "tpffts possess exponential decay .",
    "thus these pulse shapes can be approximated with high accuracy by a pulse with compact support .",
    "in addition , if the type of @xmath0 is @xmath41 , then @xmath0 is @xmath42 times continuously differentiable  @xcite .",
    "the general theory of gabor frames guarantees that the gabor frame with a totally positive window function possesses a dual pulse with exponential decay  @xcite .",
    "the construction in  @xcite yields even a dual pulse with compact support . in this paper",
    "we refine this construction and present a simple algorithm that generates a whole family of dual windows with compact support ( and increasing smoothness ) .",
    "in contrast to other methods  @xcite this algorithm is exact and requires only the pseudo - inverse of a finite matrix .",
    "we hope that the new theory of gabor frames offers a new arsenal of convenient windows for many applications where the lattice parameters need to be close to the critical case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : not - tools ] we recall the main concepts and necessary results on gabor frames , we discuss totally positive functions of finite type and their basic properties . in section",
    "[ sec : main - results ] we will state versions of theorem [ thm : grst13-main ] for discrete , periodic and finite signals , we give an algorithm to compute a dual window @xmath31 , and provide explicit formulas for totally positive functions of finite type and of their zak transforms .",
