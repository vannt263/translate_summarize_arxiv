    "the existence of a diffuse x - ray background ( @xmath3 ) was one of the first discoveries of extrasolar x - ray astronomy @xcite . in the intervening decades , observations with improving angular and spectral resolution",
    "have enhanced our understanding of the components that make up this background . above 1  kev ,",
    "the emission is highly isotropic on large angular scales , has extragalactic origin , and can be fully accounted by the superposition of unresolved point sources @xcite . below 1  kev ,",
    "the @xmath3 is a mixture of the galactic diffuse emission from a hot bubble surrounding the solar neighborhood ( the local bubble , lb ) , charge exchange from solar wind ions ( @xmath4 ) , hot gas in the galactic halo , and an extragalactic flux from point sources and from intercluster warm gas that may contain the bulk of the present day baryons @xcite .",
    "analyses of the soft x - ray background ( below 1  kev ) usually model the local bubble component as unabsorbed plasma thermal emission , the hotter galactic halo emission as multiple plasma thermal components absorbed by the gas in the galactic disk , and the unresolved extragalactic sources component ( primarily active galactic nuclei - @xmath5 ) , with an absorbed power law , which is often an extension of the power law fit derived at higher energy @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have attempted to separate the various components by using shadow experiments and other observational techniques @xcite , however such experiments only separate the various components into two major groups , foreground and background , and rely on understanding the spectral properties of the different components to fully separate them .",
    "the contribution of unresolved point sources to the @xmath3 dominates above 1  kev and is still significant at lower energies .",
    "a good understanding of its properties , beyond the extension of higher energy investigations , is therefore critical for any investigation of the @xmath3 .",
    "this , however , is made difficult by the characteristics of current x - ray missions , as high angular resolution missions such as chandrachandra/overview@xmath6cxo.html/ ] , designed for good source identification , have a relatively limited response in the energy range of interest , while missions designed for good response in the low energy range , such as the xqc program @xcite , lack the necessary angular resolution .",
    "xmm - newton , while not optimized for such an investigation , is a good compromise of angular resolution and response below 1  kev , and has been used in our investigation .",
    "we used the data from 10 observations , corresponding to 5 different targets available in the xmm - newton public archive .",
    "the choice of the targets was based on several considerations . to limit the effect of absorption from the neutral hydrogen and contamination from galactic emission we used targets at least @xmath7 above the galactic plane and with neutral hydrogen densities smaller than @xmath8 @xmath9 . to have significant statistics we also limited the investigation to targets with at least @xmath10 seconds of good observing time .",
    "the targets used and their characteristics are summarized in table  1 .    data from the full xmm - newton field of view were used in the analysis .",
    "the raw data were processed using the standard analysis software ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "events spread at most in two contiguous pixels for the @xmath12 ( i.e. , pattern=0 - 4 ) and in four contiguous pixels for the @xmath13 ( i.e. , pattern=0 - 12 ) have been selected .",
    "event files were cleaned of bad pixels ( hot pixels , events out of the field of view , etc . ) and soft proton flares .",
    "the soft proton flares are due to protons with energies less than a few hundred kev .",
    "the flares can produce a count rate up to a factor 100 greater than the mean stationary background count rate .",
    "they are variable during an observation and from observation to observation , and do not have a predictable spectral shape or spatial distribution on the detector @xcite . in order to remove periods of unwanted high background levels , we rejected the times with a 0.5 - 10 kev count rate higher than @xmath14 for the @xmath12 and @xmath15 for each of the two @xmath13 cameras .",
    "multiple observations of the same xmm - newton targets were added using @xmath11 task _",
    "merge_.      the clean event files were used to generate @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath12 images in the 0.4 - 0.6  kev and 0.5 - 2.0  kev bands .",
    "a corresponding set of exposure maps was generated to account for spatial quantum efficiency , mirror vignetting , and field of view of each instrument by running xmm - sas task _",
    "eexpmap_. this task evaluates the above quantities assuming an event energy that corresponds to the mean of the energy band boundaries .",
    "the excellent relative astrometry between the three cameras ( within @xmath18 , well under the @xmath19 of the point spread function - @xmath20 ) allowed us to merge together the @xmath13 and @xmath12 images in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the sources and reach fainter x - ray fluxes ; the corresponding exposure maps were merged as well . the source detection and characterization procedure applied to the image sets involved the creation of a background map for each energy band . as a first step , the xmm - sas sliding cell detection algorithm _",
    "eboxdetect _ was run in local detection mode . in this procedure source counts",
    "were collected in the cells of @xmath21 pixels adopting a low threshold in the detection likelihood to produce a source list .",
    "the xmm - sas task _ esplinemap _ removed from the original merged image within a radius of 1.5 times the @xmath19 of the @xmath20 all the sources in the list and creates the so - called @xmath22 image and a mask image with value unity in each pixel outside the source circles and zero within .",
    "we then flat - fielded the cheesed images by dividing them by the exposure maps and smoothed them with a gaussian of @xmath23 @xmath19 using @xmath11 task _ asmooth_. the masked images were also smoothed with the same gaussian as the actual image data .",
    "finally , background maps were calculated by dividing the smoothed cheese images by the smoothed mask images .",
    "the result was multiplied by the exposure maps .",
    "an example of background map of the lockman hole is shown in figure  1 .    using the calculated background maps , _ eboxdetect _ was run in map detection mode to identify point sources . in map detection mode",
    "the background is taken from the background maps , resulting in improved detection sensitivity as compared to the local detection step . the source list produced by _",
    "eboxdetect _ was then used as input for _",
    "emldetect_. for all the sources detected with the sliding cell method this task performs a maximum likelihood @xmath20 fit . in this way",
    "refined positions and fluxes for the sources were determined .",
    "as likelihood threshold for the detection , we adopted the value @xmath24 ( about 3  @xmath25 ) .",
    "source detection summaries for each pointing in both the 0.5 - 2.0  kev and 0.4 - 0.6  kev bands are listed in table  2 and table  3 respectively .",
    "the count rate - to - flux conversion factors for individual cameras were calculated using @xmath26 and the @xmath27 response matrices generated by xmm - sas tasks _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen_. the spectral model used was an intrinsic power law @xmath28 affected by galactic neutral hydrogen ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the individual conversion factors are listed in table  4 . the total conversion factor ( @xmath30 )",
    "was calculated using the exposure times for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath12 , and the conversion factors for the three instruments , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 following the formula : @xmath34 where @xmath35=(@xmath36+@xmath37+@xmath38 ) .",
    "the source flux is then straightforward : @xmath39    we generated sensitivity maps for each x - ray field and energy band , which contains the faintest flux at which a source can be detected at the assumed level of significance above the local background .",
    "the `` sky coverage '' defines the area of the sky covered down to a given flux limit , as a function of the flux . due to the telescope vignetting and the increase in the size of the @xmath20 in the outer regions of the detector",
    ", the sensitivity decreases toward the outer detector region . the sky coverage at a given flux",
    "was then obtained by adding up the contribution of all detector regions with a given flux limits .",
    "figure  2 shows the average sky coverage for all pointing in the 0.5 - 2.0  kev and 0.4 - 0.6  kev bands .",
    "the cumulative logn - logs distribution ( shown in figure  3 ) for all the observations has been computed by summing up the contribution of each source , weighted by the area in which the source could have been detected , following the formula : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total number of detected sources in the field with flux greater than @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the sky coverage associated with the flux of the @xmath44 source . the variance of the source number counts is then defined as : @xmath45    our result in the 0.5 - 2.0  kev energy band , is qualitatively similar to other surveys ( e.g. , in figure  3 we show the fits of giacconi et al .",

    "2008 , hasinger et al .",
    "1998 , and mushotzky et al . ,",
    "2000 ) , however our sample seems consistently richer in faint sources .",
    "when we fit the data with a power law in the flux range @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xmath48 , the resulting best fit to the logn - logs is : @xmath49 where @xmath42 is the flux in units of @xmath50 .    to quantitatively compare our result with previous investigations we looked at the number of detected sources at the faint end , bright end , and middle point of the flux range covered by our investigation .",
    "we compared our results both with the previous chandra surveys by mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and giacconi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the xmm - newton results by baldi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at the faint end of our logn - logs plot ,",
    "the number of sources detected by our investigation is 42% higher than the estimates of mushotzky ( 2000 ) and giacconi ( 2001 ) and 35% higher than the results of baldi ( 2002 ) . at brighter fluxes our results are consistent , within the errors , with both chandra data and the xmm - newton survey . at the middle of the logn - logs ( @xmath51  cgs ) , the number of detected sources is 20% higher than the chandra results and 26% higher than xmm - newton results .",
    "this discrepancy could arise from cosmic variation and/or by the different sample investigated .",
    "baldi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used a single , large area of the sky , while in most other investigations , e.g. , mushotzky ( 2000 ) and hasinger ( 1998 ) , the sources were identified and the logn - logs plot was limited to agns . while agns are expected to be the biggest contribution to x - ray point sources , our result , as confirmed by our spectral analysis reported in the next section",
    ", indicates that there is a significant component of non - agn faint sources .",
    "we also computed the resolved intensity of the detected sources by summing over the flux of each source divided by the inverse area over which the source would have been detected .",
    "the total intensity of the sources in all the pointings , in the flux range @xmath52 to @xmath50 for the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band is @xmath53 which corresponds to @xmath5436% of the total @xmath3 in the same band .",
    "figure  3 also shows the logn - logs distribution for sources in the 0.4 - 0.6  kev band , extending to a flux limit of @xmath55 .",
    "again , we fit the data with a power law in the flux range of @xmath56 to @xmath57 @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting best fit to the logn - logs is : @xmath58    the total intensity of the sources in all the pointings , in the flux range @xmath59 to @xmath60 in the 0.4 - 0.6  kev band is @xmath61 which corresponds to @xmath5425% of the total @xmath3 in that energy band .",
    "we note that all the sources identified in the 0.4 - 0.6  kev band are also identified in 0.5 - 2.0  kev band .",
    "we measured the average stacked spectrum of all the sources detected in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev and 0.4 - 0.6 kev bands . for this purpose , we use only @xmath12 data .",
    "the background spectrum was obtained using the event file of the total field of the same exposure , after removing the detected sources .",
    "the background was scaled by the ratio of the total exposure maps of the sources and the background .",
    "the @xmath11 tasks _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ were used to produce @xmath27 response matrices .",
    "we used @xmath26 to compute the slope of a power law spectrum with average @xmath29=@xmath62 .",
    "the fit was over the energy range 0.5 - 7.5 kev ( the @xmath12 spectrum shows a strong cu - k line at 8.1  kev that should be avoided ) .",
    "we obtained a photon index of @xmath63 with normalization @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 with normalization of @xmath67 @xmath65 for all the sources detected in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev and 0.4 - 0.6 kev band respectively .",
    "errors refer to 90% confidence levels .",
    "both spectra with the best fit power law are shown in figure  4 .",
    "we note that , as it may be expected , the spectrum of the sources identified in the 0.4 - 0.6 kev energy band is softer than that for the sources identified in the 0.5 - 2 kev band .",
    "the spectrum of the sources identified in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band shows an excess of counts around 1 kev at the three sigma level ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "the excess is well fitted with a zero redshift thermal component with temperature @xmath70  kev , and emission measure @xmath71  @xmath72  pc , corresponding to a flux of @xmath73  ergs  s@xmath74  @xmath9  deg@xmath75 .",
    "we attribute this thermal component to the contribution of stars in the milky way @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of the spectral shape on the source brightness .",
    "this is particularly important as in most studies of the @xmath3 only bright sources are detected and their properties are extended to faint ones .",
    "for this purpose we divided the detected sources into two groups , bright and faint , based on their flux .",
    "the threshold between the two groups was set to @xmath76 .",
    "the spectrum of bright sources detected in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band was well fitted in the energy range 0.5 - 7.5 with a power law of photon index @xmath77 and normalization @xmath78 @xmath65 plus the @xmath70  kev thermal component discussed above ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "however , the spectrum of faint sources has an excess of counts below 0.7  kev and could not be fitted with a simple power law in that range ( figure  5 ) .",
    "we performed a power law fit over the energy range 0.7 - 7.5 kev , obtaining a photon index @xmath79 with normalization @xmath80 @xmath65 .",
    "notice that the spectrum of faint sources does not show any significant thermal component around 1  kev .",
    "we investigated the nature of the excess counts below 0.7 kev and here is a summary of our conclusions :    * the excess has a statistical significance of several sigmas ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) and can not be simply explained by statistical fluctuations . * the excess was present in all pointings and is not due to a single anomalous source or target . *",
    "we tried to fit the spectrum of faint sources with two power laws , one dominating above 1  kev , the other below 1  kev , but we could not improve the fit significantly .",
    "* we also tried to fit the spectrum with a power law plus a thermal component ( figure  6 ) and the fit was greatly improved .",
    "notice that , since the spectrum is the sum of the contribution from several sources , a fit with a single thermal component has , per se , limited significance . however , the goodness of the fit is a strong indication that the excess flux may be thermal in nature",
    ". the best fit parameter for the thermal component are @xmath83  k , redshift @xmath84 , and emission measure @xmath85  @xmath72  pc , for a total flux of the excess component equal to @xmath86  ergs  s@xmath74  @xmath9  deg@xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding power law has photon index @xmath87 and normalization @xmath88 @xmath65 . at this temperature",
    "the thermal component is expected to have a significant emission in o  vii and o  viii , at a redshift that is practically indistinguishable from zero with the resolution of current satellites .",
    "the estimated emission from the excess thermal component is @xmath89  lu ( photons  s@xmath74  @xmath9  sr@xmath74 ) and @xmath90  lu for the o  vii and o  viii respectively .",
    "* we investigated the possibility that the excess is due to the contribution of milky way stellar sources .",
    "kashyap et al .",
    "( 1992 ) estimated the contribution to the diffuse soft x - ray background flux from galactic stars at various energies ranging from 0.1 to @xmath545  kev .",
    "they found that stellar contribution at high galactic latitudes is less than 3% for photon energies less than 0.3  kev , 3%-17% in the medium energy ( @xmath540.4 to @xmath540.9  kev ) and 10%-30% in the high energy band ( @xmath540.8 - 2.0  kev ) .",
    "stars mainly have two temperature thermal spectra , since stellar corona emission is composed of two components namely a hot active component at nominal temperature @xmath91  kev ( @xmath92  k ) and a somewhat cooler quiescent component @xmath93  kev ( ( @xmath94  k ) . in some stars",
    "only one thermal component is present , with a mean coronal temperature @xmath95 in the range [ 0.5 , 0.8  kev ] ( @xmath96  k ; see e.g. kashyap et al .",
    "1992 , della ceca et al .",
    "2004 , lopez - santiago et al .",
    "we have already discussed the excess thermal emission at @xmath70  kev which we attribute to the stellar hot active component and we investigated the possibility that this lower temperature excess could be due to the cooler quiescent component .",
    "we fitted the excess with a thermal component at redshift zero and obtained a good fit with temperature @xmath97  kev ( @xmath98  k ) and emission measure @xmath99  @xmath72  pc .",
    "the total flux of the excess thermal component is compatible with what expected for stellar contribution , however , the best fit temperature is significantly smaller than the temperature range predicted by kashyap et al .",
    "we also tried to fit the excess emission constraining the temperature values to the ranges described by kashyap et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , using both one and two - temperature models , but we were unable to obtain a good fit .    in conclusion , we believe that , when we look at faint sources , in addition to the typical @xmath5 contribution , there is also a significant contribution from a different class of sources with primarily thermal emission .",
    "although the total flux of this contribution is consistent with stellar origin , its temperature is too low compared to typical stellar emission .",
    "this class of sources may also be explained by unresolved faint galaxies , galaxy clusters , and/or groups , and must be taken into account in the @xmath3 budget .",
    "we repeated the same investigation for sources detected in the energy band 0.4 - 0.6 kev .",
    "the spectrum of bright ( flux @xmath100 @xmath101 ) sources detected in the 0.4 - 0.6 kev band is well described with a power law fit of photon indexes @xmath102 with normalization of @xmath103 @xmath65 ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the spectrum of faint sources has a @xmath104 statistical significance for the thermal excess below 0.7 kev and could not be fitted with a simple power law in that range ( figure  7 ) .",
    "we performed the power law fit over the energy range 0.7 - 7.5 kev , obtaining a photon index @xmath105 with normalization of @xmath106 @xmath65 . in figure  8",
    "we show the spectrum of faint sources with overlapped the power law plus thermal component model . for the thermal component we used the same parameters as for the fit of faint sources identified in the soft band .",
    "the result of the spectral analysis in both bands is summarized in tables  5 and 6 .",
    "we combined our result with previous results to create a global picture of the @xmath3 emission below 1  kev .",
    "as discussed before , in this energy range , the @xmath3 is a mixture of the galactic local bubble ( @xmath107 ) emission , solar wind charge exchange ( @xmath4 ) , hot gas in the galactic halo ( @xmath108 ) , and extragalactic flux from point sources and from intergalactic warm - hot gas ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the rosat all sky survey ( @xmath110 ) represents the most extensive study of the x - ray diffuse emission below 1  kev .",
    "analysis of @xmath110 data and subsequent observations has shown that there is significant spatial and temporal variation in the @xmath3 emission @xcite .",
    "the temporal variation is mostly attributable to the @xmath4 , while the spatial variation seems mostly due to @xmath107 and @xmath108 emission .",
    "an average over the whole sky indicates that the total diffuse x - ray emission in the @xmath111  kev energy band is @xmath112  ergs  s@xmath74  @xmath9  deg@xmath75 @xcite .",
