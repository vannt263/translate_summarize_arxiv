    "tungsten emission has been intensively studied over the last few decades due to its application in fusion devices @xcite .",
    "the intense lines in tungsten spectra are observed at around 5 nm ( mostly of n - shell ions ) where a large number of transitions from several charge states contributes to the plasma emission .",
    "this region has attracted great attention due to its importance for the plasma power balance and possible diagnostic applications .",
    "the @xmath1 nm region has been also investigated in the fusion and electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) device plasma @xcite . in the fusion plasma , a complex structure of lines",
    "is observed in this region .",
    "surprisingly , the ebit spectra corresponding to the w@xmath4 ",
    "w@xmath5 ions feature only a few lines in the @xmath6 nm wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the emission from many tungsten ions contributes to the line of sight measurements in the fusion plasma , thus , such spectra contain many lines from the different ions . on the other hand ,",
    "the ebit devices provide an unique opportunity to study the emission from one or several neighboring ions",
    ". therefore , analysis of their spectra is much easier compared with those from other plasma sources .",
    "the emission originating only from several ions can be the reason why the ebit spectra are sparse of the lines in the @xmath7 nm range .",
    "however , the corona modeling of the spectral line intensities provides complex structure of the lines for w@xmath0 @xcite in the aforementioned range .",
    "since these calculations contradict the ebit observations , it is necessary to check what kind of spectra corresponds to the collisional - radiative modeling ( crm ) . on the other hand , it is shown that the cascade emission boosts the intensities only for some lines of the w@xmath8 ion in the ebit plasma @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that the term `` cascade emission '' is used here instead of the radiative cascade in order to distinguish population of the levels from the higher - lying levels through the radiative cascade which is accounted in the corona model .",
    "the different population mechanisms appear on the scene in these two cases @xcite .",
    "the cascade processes were mostly studied for the radiative and auger decays when an inner - shell vacancy was created @xcite .",
    "ions in the ebit move in cycloidal orbits spending part of their time outside electron beam @xcite .",
    "the cascade emission starts when the ions leave the electron beam and the interaction with the electrons ends .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the ions in the low or intermediate ionization stages @xcite .",
    "it was found that under the same conditions , the higher charge ions show less expansion in the radial direction .",
    "when the charge state of the ions increases , the coulomb s attraction force directed toward the electron beam also increases .",
    "it leads to the decrease of the time the ions spend outside the beam where the cascade emission depopulates the excited levels .",
    "the effective electron density is often introduced in order to reduce electron - impact collision rates @xcite .",
    "the time fraction which the ions spend inside and outside the electron beam depends on many parameters , such as ion temperature , electron beam energy , electron beam current , electric and magnetic fields . on the other hand",
    ", the range of the ion radius @xmath9 ratio against the geometric electron radius @xmath10 can be expressed through the effective charge @xmath11 of the ion : @xmath12 with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "for w@xmath0 , one can estimate that the main paths of the ions span outside the electron beam : @xmath14 .",
    "the main aim of the current work is to study the emission spectra of the w@xmath0 ion in the ebit plasma by performing the crm with ensuing cascade emission .",
    "the emission from w@xmath0 has not deserved wide attention so far since calculations are complicated due to the open @xmath15 shells .",
    "systems with the open @xmath15 shells is further of interest for the study of the complex multi - electron high - z ions .",
    "the present work focuses on the @xmath16 nm region which accumulates the main emission from the w@xmath0 ion @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , influence of the cascade emission on the formation of lines in the ebit plasma has not been studied for this ion before .",
    "previous works concentrated on analysis of the spectral lines obtained from the crm or the corona model @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the corona model is suitable for the low density ebit plasma @xcite .",
    "the crm calculations included the @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) configurations but omitted the important the @xmath20 and @xmath21 configurations @xcite .",
    "only the strongest lines were presented in their work .",
    "the current study has been extended to 19612 levels compared with 13937 levels used in the corona model calculations @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present theoretical methods used to calculate atomic data and emission spectra . in section 3 ,",
    "the determined emission spectra corresponding to the crm and the cascade emission are discussed .",
    "energy levels , radiative transition probabilities , and electron - impact excitation rates for w@xmath0 have been calculated using flexible atomic code ( fac ) @xcite which implements the relativistic dirac - fock - slater method .",
    "previous study included 22 configurations @xcite while the current work employs 43 configurations : @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "these configurations produce 19612 levels .",
    "configuration interaction has been taken into account for all the considered configurations .",
    "the radiative transition probabilities have been calculated for electric dipole , quadrupole , and octupole and for magnetic dipole and quadrupole transitions .",
    "electron - impact excitation cross - sections are obtained within the distorted wave approximation .",
    "collision rates are calculated for 790 ev electron beam energy which corresponds to the energy used in the spectra measurements @xcite . the gaussian distribution function with a full width at a half - maximum of 30 ev is used for the electron energy .",
    "populations of levels in the crm have been obtained by solving the system of coupled rate equations @xmath40 in the steady - state equilibrium approximation ( @xmath41 ) . here",
    "@xmath42 is the population of the level @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the radiative transition probability from the level @xmath43 to the level @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the electron - impact excitation rate from the level @xmath43 to the level @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the electron density ( @xmath49 @xmath50 ) .",

    "we mean all possible radiative transitions from every not zero - populated level to the other levels .",
    "thus , transfer of the population through the intermediate levels is not included in the single step .",
    "equation ( [ radcas ] ) means that radiative transition from the level @xmath53 to the level @xmath43 transfers only part @xmath54 of the population @xmath55 .",
    "the same approach was used analyzing auger cascades @xcite .",
    "since the cascade emission takes place after ions leave electron beam , the initial population of the levels for the first step of the cascade is determined from the crm .",
    "equation ( [ radcas ] ) determines the populations of the levels when all the higher - lying levels are depopulated by the radiative decay .",
    "however , fraction of depopulation strongly depends on the time which the ions spend outside the electron beam . in this case",
    ", the population of the levels has to be determined by solving the time - dependent rate equations which omits interaction with the electrons : @xmath56    the total population @xmath57 which leaves the level @xmath43 during the time interval @xmath58 is found by integrating expression : @xmath59 which leads to @xmath60 here @xmath58 is the time the ions have spent outside the electron beam .",
    "equation ( [ population ] ) provides the populations for the time - integrated line intensities . the total population obtained by summation of the population from every step of the cascade in eq .",
    "( [ radcas ] ) corresponds to the integration taking @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ population ] ) .",
    "practically , however , convergence of the spectral line intensities has to be obtained for the finite time values .",
    "the equation ( [ radcas ] ) is applied to calculate the final spectra of the cascade emission .",

    "extended basis of interacting configurations makes it possible for the electric dipole transitions to occur . however , their transition probabilities are much lower than those of other electric dipole transitions in the region .",
