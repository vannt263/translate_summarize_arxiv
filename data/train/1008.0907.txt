    "as a possible option of the international linear collider , feasibility of physics orotundities of high energy photon - photon interaction has been considered . in the high energy photon linear colliders(plcs ) , high energy photon beams are generated by inverse compton scattering between the electron and the laser beams as illustrated in figure [ plc ] .",
    "feasibility of the plc for both physics and technical aspect , has been studied and summarized in @xcite . in these study ,",
    "one assumed integrated luminosity of 3  4 years plc operation which , for example , may happens after initial operation of @xmath1 mode of the ilc at @xmath2gev .    in this study , we investigated a feasibility of self - coupling of the higgs boson as an example of a precise measurement with the plc by assuming an ultimate integrated luminosity , i.e. , 10years operation with a high luminosity parameters .",
    "the higgs boson self - coupling constant is reprensented by @xmath3 which contributes higgs boson pair production via a diagram shown in figure [ aahh ] . here ,",
    "@xmath4 is higgs boson self - coupling constant which is included in the standard model . @xmath5",
    "represent the deviation from the standard model .",
    "the self - coupling of the higgs boson can also be studied in @xmath6 collision via the diagram shown in figure [ eezhh ] . comparing with the @xmath7 channel , where higgs boson pairs are associated with the z boson production , the higgs bosons are produced by s channel via loop diagrams in @xmath0 collision .",
    "therefore , contribution of the @xmath5 to the production cross section is difference for the @xmath6 and for @xmath0 and studies in these two modes will be complementary each other .",
    "detail of the theoritical background in this analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "for optimization photon - photon collision energy , we defined the sensitivity for the @xmath5 as ;    @xmath8    r0.5            [ crosssection ]    where , @xmath9 is a expected number of events as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath10 is the number of events expected from the standard model . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are integrated luminosity , detection efficiency of signal , cross section with @xmath5 , cross section with the standard model , detection efficiency for background events and the cross section for background processes , respectively . for @xmath13 , @xmath14 ,",
    "sensitivity is written ; @xmath15    the higgs boson mass of 120gev and the integrated luminosity of 1000fb@xmath16 was assumed in the study .",
    "the cross section is calculated by the formula which is described in @xcite with a theoretically calculated plc luminosity spectrum .",
    "the sensitivity as a function of the center of mass energy of the @xmath0 collision for @xmath17 1 and -1 is plotted in figure [ sensitivity ] .    from the figure ,",
    "the optimum energy for the @xmath0 collision for higgs boson mass of 120gev was found to be around 270gev .",
    "figure [ crosssection ] shows cross section as a function of collision energy for photon - photon interactions .",
    "figure [ crosssection ] indicates that @xmath18 is main background with the production cross section of about 90pb .",
    "on the other hand ,    r0.5    [ parameters ]    [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     with this spectrum , we expect signal of 16event / year , while @xmath19event / year for background .",
    "the decay branching ratio of the higgs boson of 120gev is shown in table [ brh ] . since",
    "main decay mode of the higgs boson of 120gev is b - quark pairs with the branching ratio of about 0.67 , we tried the case that both higgs boson decayed into b - quark pairs .",
    "r0.5                for each event , we applied forced four jets analysis in which a clustering algorithm is applied to an event by changing the clustering parameter until the event is categorized as a four jets event .",
    "after the forced four jets analysis , invariant masses for jet pairs were calculated . for a four jets event , we must to choose a right jets pairs originating from parent higgs ( or w for the background ) bosons out of three possible combinations . for this purpose , we defined @xmath20s as ;    @xmath21    where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are reconstructed particle mass , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are higgs boson and w boson mass respectively , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being their resolutions . the jet of the least @xmath20 was chosen to be the most probable combination for an event .",
    "figure [ chi2 ] shows correlation of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the most probable combination . to enhance higgs boson from the w boson events",
    ", we choosed an event satisfies @xmath30 .",
    "the mass distributions for the higgs and w boson events after @xmath20 cut are shown in figure [ masscuted ] .",
    "by the @xmath20 analysis described in previous section , the w boson background was suppressed by 0.0541 while keeping the 46@xmath31 efficiency for the higgs boson events . in order further improve signal to background ratio , we applied b - quark tagging method for remaing events .",
    "figure [ nsig ] illustrates a b - quark tagging method we applied . for each track in a reconstucted jet , @xmath32 was calculated , where l is the least approach to the interaction point of the track in the plane perpendicular to the beam and @xmath33 being its resolution .",
    "then , @xmath34 , number of track which has @xmath35 , is calculated for each jet as a function of a. in current analysis we requied all jets must satisfy @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ chi2btagged ] is the @xmath20 plot after b - tagging but before @xmath20 cuts .",
    "we obtaned backgroud suppression of @xmath37 and efficiency of signal of @xmath38 , where the errors    r0.5        are from statistic of the monte carlo simulation . for remaining envents ,",
    "@xmath20 cut were applyied . as a results , no ww events survied out of @xmath39 simulated events while keeping signal efficiency of @xmath40 .",
    "we studied feasibility of measurement of higgs self - coupling constant at the plc . for higgs mass of 120gev , optimum photon - photon collision energy for observe @xmath41",
    "was found to be about 270gev . with a parameters of plc(tesla - optimistic ) , 16events / year is expected for higgs boson events while main background of @xmath42 is about @xmath19events / year .",
    "we tried an event selection with kinematical parameters and b - quark tagging by the simulation and found that backgound suppression of @xmath43 with keeping signal efficiency of about @xmath44 seemed to be possible .    for further analysis",
    ", we plan to improve signal efficicency by :    optimization of selection criteria for @xmath45 mode .",
    "study for @xmath46 decay .    for the backgound ,",
    "it is necessary to estimate contribution from @xmath47 events .",
