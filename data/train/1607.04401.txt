    "in mathematics sphere packing problems concern the arrangements of non - overlapping equal spheres which fill a space . usually the space involved is the three - dimensional euclidean space where the famous _ kepler conjecture _ was proved by t.  c.  hales and s.  p.  ferguson in @xcite .",

    "we have studied some new aspects of the horoball and hyperball packings in @xmath15 and we have observed that the ball , horoball and hyperball packing problems are not settled yet in the @xmath6-dimensional @xmath16 hyperbolic space .    in @xcite we generalized the above problem of finding the densest geodesic and translation ball ( or sphere ) packing to the other @xmath5-dimensional homogeneous geometries ( thurston geometries ) @xmath17 and in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we investigated several interesting ball packing and covering problems in the above geometries .",

    "we obtain a conjecture for optimal geodesic ball packing configurations and determine their densities related to the above prismatic tessellations . _",
    "the results are summarized in theorems 3.4 , 4.3 and conjecture [ conj : ball ] , and the optimal ball configurations are visualized in our model with figures 2 , 3 .",
    "in this section we summarize the significant notions and denotations of the @xmath0 geometry ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 geometry is a homogeneous 3-space derived from the famous real matrix group @xmath32 discovered by w.  heisenberg .",
    "the lie theory with the method of the projective geometry makes possible to investigate and to describe this topic .",
    "the left ( row - column ) multiplication of heisenberg matrices @xmath33 defines `` translations '' @xmath34 on the points of the space @xmath35 .",
    "these translations are not commutative in general . the matrices @xmath36 of the form @xmath37 constitute the one parametric centre , i.e. each of its elements commutes with all elements of @xmath38 .",
    "the elements of @xmath39 are called _",
    "fibre translations_. @xmath0 geometry of the heisenberg group can be projectively ( affinely ) interpreted by the `` right translations '' on points as the matrix formula @xmath40 shows , according to ( 1.1 ) .",
    "here we consider @xmath38 as projective collineation group with right actions in homogeneous coordinates .",
    "we will use the cartesian homogeneous coordinate simplex @xmath41,@xmath42,@xmath43 , @xmath44  @xmath45 @xmath46 which is distinguished by an origin @xmath47 and by the ideal points of coordinate axes , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 with @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 defines a point @xmath51 of the projective 3-sphere @xmath52 ( or that of the projective space @xmath53 where opposite rays @xmath54 and @xmath55 are identified ) .",
    "the dual system @xmath56 describes the simplex planes , especially the plane at infinity @xmath57 , and generally , @xmath58 defines a plane @xmath59 of @xmath52 ( or that of @xmath53 ) .",

    "molnr has shown that a rotation trough angle @xmath65 about the @xmath66-axis at the origin , as isometry of @xmath0 , keeping invariant the riemann metric everywhere , will be a quadratic mapping in @xmath67 to @xmath66-image @xmath68 as follows : @xmath69 this rotation formula , however , is conjugate by the quadratic mapping @xmath70 @xmath71 i.e. to the linear rotation formula .",
    "this quadratic conjugacy modifies the @xmath0 translations in ( 2.3 ) , as well .",
    "we shall use the following important classification theorem .    1 .",
    "any group of @xmath0 isometries , containing a 3-dimensional translation lattice , is conjugate by the quadratic mapping in ( 2.5 ) to an affine group of the affine ( or euclidean ) space @xmath72 whose projection onto the ( x , y ) plane is an isometry group of @xmath73 .",
    "such an affine group preserves a plane @xmath74 point polarity of signature @xmath75 .",
    "2 .   of course , the involutive line reflection about the @xmath76 axis @xmath77 preserving the riemann metric , and its conjugates by the above isometries in * 1 * ( those of the identity component ) are also @xmath0-isometries",
    ". there does not exist orientation reversing @xmath0-isometry .",
    "we obtain from the above described projective model a new model of @xmath0 geometry derived by the quadratic mapping @xmath70 .",

    "the geodesic curves of the @xmath0 geometry are generally defined as having locally minimal arc length between their any two ( near enough ) points .",

    "we can assume , that the starting point of a geodesic curve is the origin because we can transform a curve into an arbitrary starting point by translation ( 2.1 ) ; @xmath79 the arc length parameter @xmath80 is introduced by @xmath81 i.e. unit velocity can be assumed .",
