    "recent measurements @xcite of two - body charmless hadronic @xmath4 meson decays confirm the so - called @xmath5 puzzle . according to the pdg average @xcite of cleo , babar and belle measurements , the @xmath6 decay rate turned out to be unexpectedly large when compared to the rate obtained within the standard effective hamiltonian approach using quark operators multiplied by wilson coefficients @xcite .",
    "namely , the enhancement of @xmath7 when compared to the qcd - penguin dominated @xmath8 rates @xmath9 calls for an additional contribution to the @xmath10 channel , either by performing a more complete treatment within the standard model ( sm ) or by invoking new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "since the properties of the @xmath11-particle are related to the qcd axial anomaly , it has been quite generally expected that the enhancement in ( [ ketap ] ) is related to this anomaly .    among various mechanisms considered to explain the @xmath12 amplitude within the sm , the @xmath13 transition plays a distinguished role .",
    "there was an invitation in @xcite to consider it as a promising short - distance ( sd ) mechanism .",
    "it pertains to the recently studied singlet penguin mechanism @xcite , involving two gluons fusing into @xmath11 .    in the present paper we focus on the sd contribution to @xmath13 incorporating the electroweak @xmath2 transition followed by the off - shell gluon fusion @xmath3 , where @xmath14 denotes a virtual gluon , and @xmath15 corresponds to the flavour singlet state . for low - energy gluons",
    "the @xmath16 vertex should be dominated by the qcd triangle anomaly analogously to the @xmath17 amplitude . however , for ( at least ) one highly virtual gluon of momentum @xmath18 , the @xmath16 vertex is expected to be suppressed like @xmath19 similarly to the effective @xmath20 vertex @xcite .",
    "this remnant of the anomaly for hard off - shell gluons we will call the `` anomaly tail '' contribution .",
    "there has been a renewed interest in such contributions in view of the hadronic contributions to @xmath21 that they induce @xcite .",
    "a more complete discussion on the various mechanisms presented in the literature for @xmath22 @xcite , including various versions of form factors for @xmath16 @xcite will be relegated to a forthcoming paper . in these proposals , as a rule , the gluon virtuality employed in the @xmath16 transition form factor lies below @xmath23 . in contrast , we consider highly virtual gluons , above the @xmath24 scale , corresponding to the mentioned anomaly tail contribution .    after presenting in sect .",
    "2 the electroweak @xmath2 vertex , in sect .",
    "3 we demonstrate how the virtual gluons are glued to the `` anomaly tail '' part of the @xmath25 vertex mentioned above .",
    "the resulting contribution is dubbed the `` short distance anomaly '' ( sda ) in what follows . in the concluding section",
    "we discuss the meaning of our results and the relation of our contributions to those existing in the literature .",
    "the flavour changing transitions into two virtual gluons were considered by two of the authors in the context of the double - penguin contributions to the @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 mixing @xcite .",
    "they have been subsequently studied by simma and wyler @xcite in the case of rare @xmath4-decays .",
    "let us now reconsider these transitions by taking the symmetric gluon momenta , so that we will be able to present the analytical expressions suitable for evaluation of hard - gluon loop integrals .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 amplitude reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote colour matrices , and @xmath31 are the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) factors .",
    "@xmath32 subsums the contribution from the box on fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle](a ) , the contribution from the triangle on fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle](b ) , and the contribution from the off - diagonal @xmath33 self - energy .    the one - loop graphs which contribute to the box ( a ) and triangle ( b ) parts of the amplitude ( [ bsgg ] ) . ]    the @xmath34 loop in fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle](b ) is proportional to the gluonic monopole , @xmath35 .",
    "this @xmath36 dependence is canceled by the @xmath37 dependence of the @xmath38-quark propagator in this reducible diagram . after combining the triangle and the self - energy contribution ,",
    "the uv divergences mutually cancel , and only the monopole , triangle part contributes significantly .    by anticipating the antisymmetric structure of the @xmath39 vertex into which the virtual gluons on fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle ] proceed , we select the relevant antisymmetric contribution : @xmath40 where we obtain @xmath41   & \\quad + \\frac{2 m_{w}^2}{m_{i}^2-m_{w}^2}\\left(1- \\frac{m_{i}^2}{2m_{w}^2}\\right )   \\int_{0}^{1 } \\mathrm{d}x ( 1-x )   \\bigg\\ { ( 3x-1 ) \\mathbb{y}_1   \\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad +     \\left[x^2(1-x)p^{2}+(x+1)m_{i}^{2}\\right ] \\mathbb{y}_2   \\bigg\\ } \\;.",

    "let us stress that @xmath43 has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath44 for high gluon momenta ( @xmath45 ) , which is essential in order to obtain an overall finite gluon loop contribution to @xmath46 on fig .",
    "[ gluonloop ] .",
    "another interesting limit is the leading logarithmic approximation @xmath47 where we have neglected the @xmath48-quark contribution which is ckm suppressed .",
    "it should be noted that this leading contribution comes from the triangle graph in fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle](b ) , corresponding to the first term in ( [ ai ] ) .",
    "the box graph has no leading logarithm and is numerically small .",
    "this clearly differs from the dominance of the box part displayed on fig . 1 of @xcite , and an explanation on the relevance of the @xmath2 amplitude ( [ bsgg ] ) is in order .",
    "there were suggestions in the literature ( e. g. @xcite ) that because of large cancellations observed by @xcite , the contribution of the @xmath2 mode followed by a @xmath49 transition would be extremely small .",
    "it should be strongly emphasized that this statement , valid for soft gluons , is wrong for hard virtual gluons , as explicated in the expressions above .",
    "therefore , in the next section we take under scrutiny the amplitude stemming from the antisymmetric part of the electroweak amplitude on fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle ] .",
    "in this section , we will consider the anomaly tail part of the effective @xmath3 vertex to be connected to the @xmath50 amplitude from the preceding section . by restricting to the hard gluons , having a virtuality above the @xmath51 scale ,",
    "we aim at singling out the short distance amplitude for the @xmath1 transition .",
    "this amplitude is of the same order in @xmath52 as recently studied amplitudes with ( colour ) singlet penguin topology @xcite .",
    "the hard gluon loop contribution to the @xmath53 transition , determined by vertices ( [ bsgg ] ) and ( [ etagg ] ) ]    we need an expression for the gluonic triangle contribution for @xmath3 on fig .  [ etaanomaly ] . using the kinematical choice @xmath54 , @xmath55 for the two gluon momenta in this figure",
    ", we get a general expression for the @xmath3 vertex @xmath56 in our case , @xmath57 will turn out to be a remnant of the gluonic anomaly . a priori",
    ", the quantity @xmath58 depends also on the momentum @xmath59 , but for our purposes we only need to keep @xmath59 to first order there , which means that @xmath58 is taken as independent of the @xmath11 momentum .",
    "our effective vertices ( [ bsgg ] ) and ( [ etagg ] ) allow us a perturbative evaluation of the amplitude displayed on fig .",
    "[ gluonloop ] : @xmath60 having in mind that both vertices @xmath61 and @xmath62 imply hard gluons in the loop , we arrive at the short distance representation of the singlet penguin diagram discussed in @xcite .",
    "after substitution of ( [ bsgg ] ) and ( [ etagg ] ) , our result for the short distance di - gluon mechanism reads @xmath63 since @xmath64 and @xmath65 are already one - loop quantities , @xmath66 is a 3-loop amplitude .",
    "let us stress that eqs .",
    "( [ sploop ] ) and ( [ asda ] ) apply quite generally for all @xmath67 form factors @xmath57 . in this paper",
    "we will use these formulae for the sda contribution only .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath3 transition amplitude for off - shell gluons is theoretically analogous to the evaluation of the `` off - shell anomaly '' for the flavour triplet axial current related to @xmath68 .",
    "a naive treatment of this photonic case leads to problems with unitarity for the @xmath69 amplitude presented by jacob and wu @xcite , and a number of papers @xcite has been devoted to its cure .",
    "the pertinent triangle amplitude was calculated first by rosenberg @xcite and reconsidered by adler @xcite , who observed difficulties with divergences when inserting the triangle loop into the next loop . on the other hand , for off - shell photons",
    ", it was shown by @xcite that the perturbative mass - independent part in the triangle diagram is canceled by the pion pole anomalous contribution .",
    "this observation was essential to resolve the jacob - wu paradox @xcite . in our gluonic case",
    "it means that , although the quantity @xmath58 in ( [ etagg ] ) obtained in a perturbative calculation of the quark - triangle loop is a priori proportional to @xmath70 the unity term gets canceled @xcite . in ( [ ktj ] )",
    "we introduced @xmath71 representing the denominator emerging from the triangle - loop integral .    for the @xmath3 transition",
    "the flavours @xmath72 contribute ( eventually only the @xmath38-quark contribution turns out to be important ) , and we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 mev and @xmath75    the @xmath76 amplitude with indicated symmetric kinematical choice . ]",
    "this represents the short distance amplitude for hard gluon virtualities far above the @xmath11-mass .",
    "this effective vertex enters into the final gluonic loop on fig .",
    "[ gluonloop ] for loop momenta @xmath77 . in the evaluation of the loop integral producing the short distance 3-loop contribution for the @xmath78 amplitude",
    ", the overall renormalization scale @xmath79 will be of the order @xmath51 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath79 acts as the effective ir cut - off in our loop integral , we find that the expression ( [ fan ] ) is slightly modified ( @xmath80 in ( [ fan ] ) above ) . in the leading logarithmic approximation",
    "we obtain for the @xmath38-quark term @xmath81 while the @xmath48- and @xmath82-quark contributions are completely negligible due to their small masses . on account of the ckm unitarity , the loop integral parts in ( [ asda ] ) @xmath83 form the relevant gim combination displayed on fig .",
    "this plot exhibits a reasonably mild dependence on the infra - red cut - off ( @xmath79 ) in the gluon loop , justifying a sensible short - distance amplitude .",
    "note that the uv convergence of the loop integral is guaranteed by the high energy behaviour of ( [ ai ] ) and ( [ etaggeff ] ) .",
    "since the used form - factor ( [ etaggeff ] ) corresponds to the anomaly tail term , the net contribution can be termed the `` short distance anomaly '' , as suggested in the introduction . also , fig .",
    "[ tail ] shows the dominance of the triangle with respect to the electroweak box contribution .",
    "the infra - red stability check of the anomaly tail contribution ( solid line ) displaying also the dominance of the triangle part ( dashed line ) over the box part ( dotted line ) from fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle ] . ]    in the leading logarithmic approximation , we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ llog ] ) , ( [ etaggeff ] ) and ( [ i - integral ] ) @xmath84 which may be compared with the result from the ( octet ) penguin operator to lowest order in the leading logarithmic approximation @xmath85",
    "in the present letter we attempt to clarify a possible role of the @xmath86 transition in explaining the @xmath0 amplitude , and in particular the role of the qcd anomaly in obtaining the @xmath86 amplitude .",
    "the result above shows that we are able to successfully distinguish the short distance @xmath13 amplitude ( sda ) related to the qcd axial anomaly .",
    "thereby , the involved form of the flavour - changing vertex for hard gluons is in clear contrast to the result obtained by @xcite for soft gluons , where the box ( fig .  [ boxtriangle](a ) ) instead of the triangle ( fig .",
    "[ boxtriangle](b ) ) dominates .",
    "this enhancement of the electroweak vertex for the hard off - shell gluons is compensated by a suppression in the two gluon fusion to @xmath11 vertex .",
    "the net @xmath53 amplitude coming from this anomaly tail turns out to be dominated by the strange quark contribution . in the present approach it corresponds to the quark triangle contribution to the @xmath39 coupling for the highly off - shell gluons .",
    "we note that the sda result vanishes in the chiral limit @xmath87 .",
    "thus , demonstrating that we have obtained a contribution which is different from those already existing in the literature , we can attempt to compare it to some related amplitudes . a simple comparison of our singlet amplitude ( [ asda ] ) at the leading logarithm level ( [ i - intll ] ) to the ordinary penguin in ( [ peng ] ) : @xmath88 gives the ratio @xmath89 where we did nt explicate some additional factors in @xmath90 and @xmath91 which cancel in the ratio .",
    "this ratio is at the level of a few percent , but depends strongly on what one takes for the involved parameters .",
    "how this estimate will be modified within a more proper treatment of renormalization group equations is also an issue to be further investigated .",
    "we have done a simple estimate which shows that short distance qcd corrections do not change this result substantially .    to conclude",
    ", the above demonstrates that purely short - distance anomalous ( sda ) aspects of the @xmath13 vertex are marginal in explaining the @xmath92 puzzle .",
    "there was a similar fate for the electroweak @xmath93 contribution to the short - distance @xmath94 amplitude @xcite .",
    "there is an additional experience in the analogous off - shell photon case @xcite , where the corresponding qed quark triangle overshoots the measured value of the related form factor .    in our case",
    ", the smallness of the anomaly contribution to the @xmath13 can be ascribed to the depletion of the qcd off - shell triangle vertex .",
    "accordingly , the expectation of @xcite , as we understand it , turns out not to be fullfiled , and we seem to be in compliance with the conclusions by @xcite that the singlet penguins do not do the job and that a combination of several effects within the standard model would be necessary . in addition , our observation of the absence of the suppression in the electroweak vertex , when we departure from truly soft gluons , opens a window for some other contributions which resemble the qcd anomaly .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite advocated that the @xmath92 puzzle could be explained by the additional complicated non - perturbative quark - gluon interactions related to the anomaly .",
    "however , at present these interactions are merely parametrized by a phenomenological coupling . such an extra piece to the usual effective hamiltonian , appearing due to non - perturbative aspects of the qcd anomaly , has to be justified yet .",
    "we intend to come back to a more complete treatment of the @xmath92 amplitude in a forthcoming paper .",
