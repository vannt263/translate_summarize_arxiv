    "dark matter haloes constitute the scaffolding on which the luminous component of cosmic structure can be detected in the form of galaxies . the connection between ordinary matter ( i.e. `` baryons '' ) and the dominant dark matter can only be found indirectly because of the elusive nature of the latter .",
    "theoretical studies give useful insight under a number of assumptions about the properties of the dark matter component .",
    "n - body simulations predict a universal density profile @xcite driven by two parameters , the mass of the halo  usually defined out to a virial radius  and the concentration , given as the ratio between the scale length of the halo ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ) and the virial radius .",
    "a number of n - body simulations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) display a significant trend between these two parameters , mainly driven by the hierarchical buildup of structure .",
    "massive haloes assemble at later epochs  when the background density is lower because of the expansion of the universe .",
    "hence , we expect a trend whereby concentration decreases with increasing galaxy mass .",
    "an observational confirmation of this theoretical result by means of model - independent mass reconstruction gives insights in the interplay between luminous and dark matter .    over cluster",
    "scales it is possible to explore the dark matter halo via its effect on the gravitational potential . the x - ray bremsstrahlung emission from the hot gas in the intracluster medium acts as a tracer of the potential .",
    "if assumptions are made about the dynamical state of the cluster , one can constrain the halo properties ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found a significant correlation between dark matter halo and mass , as expected from theoretical studies .",
    "their sample covers a range from massive early - type galaxies up to galaxy clusters . in this paper , we extend the observational effort towards lower masses , constraining the haloes over galaxy scales by the use of strong gravitational lensing . by targeting a sample of strong lenses at moderate redshift ( z@xmath60.5 ) we probe the mass distribution out to a few ( @xmath64 ) effective radii .",
    "other approaches to probe dark matter haloes over galaxy scales involve the use of dynamical tracers such as the bulk of the stellar populations @xcite .",
    "while sauron data , as used in @xcite is restricted to 12 effective radii by the surface brightness detection limit of the observations and contains thus little information on the properties of the halos , studies based on more extended data are available ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". additionally , planetary nebul  in the outer regions of galaxies @xcite or globular clusters @xcite make it possible to probe the dark matter profile .",
    "being evolved phases of the underlying stellar populations , planetary nebul  can be considered unbiased tracers of the gravitational potential ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . through their emission lines ,",
    "it is possible to trace their kinematics out to large distances , reaching out to @xmath7@xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the results is difficult because of the uncertainties regarding the parameterisation of the halo mass , anisotropy , shape , or inclination @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing studies do not suffer from the inherent degeneracies of methods regarding the modelling of the dynamical tracers , although it is fair to say that lensing studies have other modelling degeneracies , as we discuss in the following section . ultimately , a comparison between all these methods is key to a robust assessment of the @xmath1 relation .",
    "our recent study of stellar and total mass in lensing galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lfsf ) indicated an inverse trend of concentration with mass .",
    "those results , however , applied to radii much smaller than the virial radius @xmath8 . in this work",
    ", we extend this analysis by extrapolating the inferred dark - matter profiles out to @xmath8 , to determine whether the concentration / mass trend persists to lower masses , i.e. , galaxy haloes .",
    "we then try to reconstruct the possible concentrations of the dark - matter haloes before adiabatic contraction due to the baryons .",
    "we consider a sample of 18 early - type lensing galaxies . in lfsf  these galaxies ( plus two disk galaxies and one ongoing major merger ) were decomposed into stellar and dark - matter profiles .",
    "the stellar - mass or @xmath9 profiles were obtained by fitting stellar population synthesis models to the star light .",
    "the lensing - mass or @xmath10 profiles were obtained from lens models .",
    "the difference between these is assumed to be the dark - matter profile .    in section  [ sec1 ] of the present paper",
    "we summarize the method of deriving the dark - matter profile as @xmath11 .",
    "we also consider the technique of simply fitting a two - component lens model .",
    "the latter technique , in a test case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lensmodels ] ) appears adequate for estimating @xmath10 but significantly overestimates @xmath9 .    in section  [ sec : cm ] we fit well - known nfw and hernquist profiles to the dark and stellar - mass profiles respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : paramfit ] shows the nfw and hernquist parameter estimates and uncertainties for two of the galaxies , while figure  [ fig : profiles2 ] shows the dark - matter profiles for the same two galaxies .",
    "the nfw fits automatically provide a virial mass @xmath12 and a concentration @xmath13 , in effect extrapolating the dark - matter profile out to the virial radius @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cm ] shows @xmath12 and @xmath13 for all 18 galaxies . the trend shown in @xcite is seen to extend down to virial masses of @xmath14 .",
    "we remark that the nfw fits shows a characteristic banana - shaped near - degeneracy between the virial mass @xmath12 and the concentration @xmath13 .",
    "these contribute a spurious inverse correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but they are much smaller than the overall trend .",
    "in section  [ sec : am ] we use abundance matching ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to derive a virial mass @xmath15 directly from @xmath9 .",
    "the two estimates @xmath15 and @xmath12 tend to agree in the majority , but there are cases of strong disagreement .",
    "interestingly , the latter are all galaxies in dense environments .",
    "we also consider the option of constraining the nfw fit such that @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles - all ] shows how the mass profiles get modified if this is done , while figure  [ fig : cmam ] shows how the @xmath13-@xmath12 distribution changes . in the latter case , the scatter increases considerably .",
    "in section  [ sec : ac ] we attempt to reconstruct the initial concentrations , by fitting the adiabatic - contraction model of @xcite .",
    "we find that the usual prescriptions for adiabatic - contraction imply unrealistically low values of @xmath17 , but weaker adiabatic contractions do fit our results ( see figure  [ fig : ac ] ) . by tweaking the average radius in the adiabatic - contraction prescription ( which can be interpreted as mass loss during adiabatic contraction )",
    "we can obtain agreement with the data .",
    "the inferred @xmath17 are shown in figure  [ fig : cmini ] , from which it appears that adiabatic contraction can explain part of the @xmath13-@xmath12 trend but is unlikely to be the sole origin of it .",
    "the starting point of the present work is the models in lfsf  of the projected stellar and total surface mass density from a sample of lensing galaxies .",
    "we obtained independent maps for the stellar mass and total mass , using archival data from the castles survey .",
    "the maps of stellar mass , @xmath9 , were derived by fitting stellar population synthesis models to photometry in two or more bands assuming a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) . the total or lens mass , @xmath10 ,",
    "was mapped by computing pixellated lens models that fitted the lensed images and ( where available ) time delays .",
    "detailed error estimates were derived in both cases .",
    "the enclosed total mass is well constrained at projected radii where images are present . at smaller and larger",
    "radii , @xmath10 becomes progressively more uncertain .",
    "the outer radius of the mass maps is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius of the outermost image . since @xmath19 depends on the redshift and details of the source position",
    ", @xmath18 varies greatly among galaxies  from a quarter of the half - light radius ( @xmath20 ) to several @xmath20 .    of the sample modelled in lfsf , 18 galaxies are early type systems .",
    "we exclude the einstein cross q2237 , which is the bulge of a spiral galaxy ; b1600 , which is likely to be a late - type galaxy viewed edge - on ; and b1608 , which is an ongoing merger . for these 18 early type galaxies",
    ", there is no evidence of a significant gaseous component , and hence we may assume that @xmath21 is a map of the dark matter distribution .",
    "the lensing maps tend to have similar orientation to the stellar mass , and hence the @xmath22 maps are fairly elliptical as well @xcite . in lfsf",
    "we obtained enclosed dark matter profiles @xmath23 using a circularized aperture along the elliptical isophotes , i.e. following the luminous distribution .",
    "an alternative approach ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consists of fitting a parametric lens model with separate components for stellar and dark matter .",
    "if the stellar component can be correctly recovered by this method , the analysis based on stellar population synthesis constrained by multiband photometry will be dispensable .",
    "the two approaches are contrasted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lensmodels ] in the case of the quad pg1115 + 080 . on the one hand we prepared separate models for @xmath10 and @xmath9",
    " a pixellated lens model for @xmath10 and a stellar - population model from the photometry for @xmath9 . on the other hand , we fitted the lensing data to a multi - component parametric lens model : a de  vaucouleurs profile , plus an nfw halo , together with a singular isothermal sphere , adding external shear to account for a nearby galaxy group .",
    "we used the gravlens program @xcite together with markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) to search for the best fit parameters .",
    "the effective radius was constrained to lie within the observational uncertainty @xmath24  arcsec @xcite .",
    "the positions , ellipticities and position angle were also allowed to vary .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : lensmodels ] that the parametric and pixellated lens models give similar results for the total - mass profile .",
    "the pixellated method provides uncertainty estimates because it generates an ensemble of models .",
    "it is also computationally faster .",
    "however , the stellar mass is strongly overestimated by the parametric lens model , compared to the estimates based on population synthesis . in other words ,",
    "the attempt to infer stellar masses from the lensing data alone fails .",
    "an explanation for this is suggested by the error bars on the total - mass .",
    "we see that lensing provides a good estimate of the enclosed mass at radii comparable to the images , but gets progressively more uncertain as we move inwards or outwards .",
    "thus , attempting to extract the profile of a sub - component from this already - uncertain total - mass profile ( without adding more data ) will tend to amplify the errors .",
    "hence , for the rest of this paper , we will use the separate models of @xmath10 and @xmath9 from lfsf .",
    "with the maps of @xmath25 surface mass density in hand , we now proceed to estimate a virial mass @xmath12 and a concentration @xmath13 for each of the lensing galaxies .",
    "the method we adopt is to fit the profiles of @xmath23 to the cumulative projected mass of an nfw profile , which is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the scale radius and scale density parameters on which the nfw profile depends . for @xmath23 we assumed an error @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is half of the @xmath32 confidence interval given by the ensemble of lens - mass models , and @xmath33 is the standard deviation of stellar mass from population synthesis .",

    "this choice tends to illustrate the parameters better . to check for the possibility of multiple local @xmath34-minima we generated mcmc chains with @xmath38 steps for each lens .",
    "such additional minima can be excluded for physically interesting parameter values . as a further check ,",
    "we compute as before the nfw parameters based on a @xmath34 search that best fit the steepest and shallowest profiles @xmath39 allowed by the lfsf  analysis of the lensing data .",

    "[ fig : paramfit ] ]    figure [ fig : profiles2 ] shows profiles of @xmath23 , together with nfw fits and uncertainties .",
    "there is a tendency for the innermost point ( in these two examples as well in other lenses in our study ) to be higher than the fit .",
    "we note that various simulations @xcite indicate a somewhat steeper slope than the original nfw .",
    "recently @xcite advocated a generalized nfw profile with an additional parameter .",
    "furthermore , the presence of baryons will tend to steepen the central dark - matter profile through adiabatic contraction ( although we note that feedback effects , such as baryon ejecta from supernovae - driven winds , or dynamical interactions with smaller structures could have the opposite effect , making the inner dark matter profile shallower ) .",
    "we will address the issue of adiabatic contraction later , in section [ sec : am ] .",
    "for now we assume that a projected nfw depending on scale radius @xmath28 and the normalization @xmath29 sufficiently describe the data .     and",

    "[ fig : profiles2 ] ]    > from the nfw parameters @xmath46 and given the redshift of the halo , the virial mass @xmath12 and concentration @xmath13 are easily derived .",
    "consider first the mass enclosed in a sphere ( not to be confused with the cylindrical enclosed mass eq .",
    "[ eq : nfw ] ) @xmath47 and the mean enclosed density within a given radius @xmath48 the virial radius is the @xmath49 at which the mean enclosed density equals a certain multiple @xmath50 of the critical density , namely : @xmath51 and the mass within the virial radius @xmath52 is the virial mass .",

    "this value of @xmath50 gives the exact virial radius for a top - hat perturbation that has just virialized ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the galaxies in our sample would have virialized well before the observed epoch .",
    "hence , if the observed redshift is used to derive an @xmath8 , the value is unlikely to have the dynamical interpretation of a virial radius . nevertheless , since such a definition of @xmath8 is commonly adopted ( e.g. * ?",

    "* ) we adopt it in the present work .",

    "figure  [ fig : cm ] plots the values  there have been no previous data showing @xmath12 vs @xmath13 to such small virial masses . for comparison , figure  [ fig : cm ] also shows the results from @xcite of the x - ray @xmath58-@xmath12 relation for 39 systems . these range in @xmath12 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 @xmath61 .",

    "as in their analysis we use a bivariate fitting method for correlated errors and intrinsic scatter ( bces ) due to @xcite , which gives @xmath70 .    note how in figure  [ fig : cm ] the projected @xmath42 contours cover a smaller region than simple vertical and horizontal error bars would imply .",
    "this suggests that more information might be available with the appropriate tools .",
    "hence , we tried alternative fitting approaches . in a parametric boostrap we randomly resample over arbitrary points within the @xmath42 contours , so that one point per lens is used for an ordinary least square fit .",
    "this is done for @xmath71 realizations . in a later run",
    "we ease the requirement of one point per lens and pick instead a number @xmath72 out of the total number of lenses to perform the resampling . in all cases",

    "however , it should be noted that the reduced sample size and considerable scatter leads to large errors for both samples .",

    "we now compare the quantities extrapolated to the virial radius with predictions using both simulations and sdss observations .        , but showing how the fits change when abundance matching is included .",

    "[ fig : cm ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : cmam ] leads mostly to shifts along the direction of the relation , but the rms scatter with respect to the simple power - law fit almost doubles , from 0.145 to 0.258 . in comparison ,",
    "the @xcite sample has a rms scatter of 0.180 .",
    "a mildly increased scatter can be found in simulations by @xcite for virial masses between @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which is most likely due to the indistinguishability between substructure and main haloes .",
    "however , this can not explain the increased scatter we find .",
    "we can conclude that the extrapolation to @xmath8 inferred in section [ sec : cm ] gives a reasonable extension to the @xmath13-@xmath12 relation .",
    "abundance matching , on the other hand , appears to introduce a large discrepancy in some cases .",
    "three of the galaxies ( mg2016 , b1422 and b1030 ) show a shift to a much higher concentration when abundance matching is imposed .",
    "these are lenses for which @xmath15 lies significantly below the extrapolation @xmath12 . for mg2016",
    ", @xmath15 is even smaller than @xmath23 at the outermost radius of the lens model .",
    "further three galaxies ( q0047 , mg0414 , sbs1520 ) show large shifts towards lower concentrations . they belong to the highest redshift galaxies in our sample and are probed in an exceptionally large radial range , up to @xmath120 of the virial radius ( see column @xmath121 in tab .  [ tab2 ] ) . moreover , mg2016 and sbs1520 , which exhibit strongly discrepant @xmath15 , have reconstructed mass profiles with comparatively small uncertainties",
    ".    so what is the reason for this discrepancy ?",
    "a possible explanation is suggested by a visible correlation between the length of the arrows and the environment of the lenses . for extrapolated virial masses much lower than @xmath15 one may argue that lens profiles are shallower in group or cluster environments than in more isolated locations .",
    "this reflects the inverse proportionality of concentration and enclosed mass and is a consequence of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "extrapolating mass profiles from shallower profiles leads necessarily to lower masses at @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , if the @xmath122 obtained from abundance matching is employed to determine @xmath15 , we implicitly assume an isolated galaxy located within a `` typical '' halo with respect to its stellar content and the halo definition used in the abundance matching procedure . for lenses with extrapolated virial masses much larger than @xmath15 the mere effect of the projected cluster environment might become more important , that is , although being relatively shallow , the projected total mass profile is strongly influenced by dark matter in the cluster acting as an additional convergence .",
    "this again causes the extrapolation to be significantly different from @xmath15 .",
    "examples for the latter case are mg2016 and b1422 , which are located in the densest environments among our lenses with large groups or clusters showing many nearby galaxies ( cf .  table  1 in lfsf ) .",
    "all 8 lenses for which @xmath15 is strongly discrepant with @xmath12 are in dense environments , whereas for 6 out of 10 remaining galaxies , there are no nearby objects reported so far .",
    "current abundance - matching prescriptions do not consider environmental effects .",
    "our results suggest that environment may significantly influence the @xmath122 function .",
    "in the following section we will assess the extent to which the @xmath58-@xmath12 relation could be caused by adiabatic contraction of the halo . @xcite proposed that during the formation of galaxy - sized structures , the collapse of the dissipative baryons towards the centre of the forming halo would extert a reaction on the dark matter density profile , making it steeper .",
    "this effect would mean that simple n - body simulations , such as those that led to the proposal of the nfw profile @xcite , would underestimate the inner slope of the halo .",
    "the concentrations derived in section  [ sec : cm ] would therefore represent the state of the halo after adiabatic contraction ( ac ) . in this section",
    ", we will refer to these concentrations as @xmath123 . before ac",
    ", the concentrations are thought to have a lower value @xmath17 . at present",
    "it is not clear whether or not @xmath17 differed from @xmath123 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is conceivable that the impact of ac on dark matter profiles might be overestimated by commonly used recipes for baryonic cooling .",
    "additional mechanisms such as dynamical encounters with smaller structures ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the ejecta of baryons triggered by supernovae - driven winds @xcite could lead to the opposite effect , making the inner slope of the dark matter profile less cuspy . in this paper",
    "we only consider the effect from the more fundamental process of contraction during the formation of the halo .          to analyze this issue , we make use of the halo contraction program of @xcite , which computes the change in the dark - matter density profile under ac , keeping @xmath124 conserved . to take account of a wide range of orbit eccentricities",
    "the code invokes the power - law @xmath125 to describe the mean relation between orbit - averaged and current radius , and modifies the adiabatic invariant to @xmath126 .",
    "[ eq : fudge ] changes the eccentricity distribution of the mass profile , which is thus distorted by the usage of a mean radius in the invariant .",
    "parameter @xmath127 defines the maximum eccentricity and causes @xmath126 to be larger than @xmath124 for @xmath128 and smaller for @xmath129 .",
    "a larger invariant means more mass in the center at the expense of the outer parts of the halo .",
    "the parameter @xmath130 defines how strong the shift is .",
    "the smaller @xmath130 the fewer mass at the center .",
    "the case @xmath131 therefore corresponds to the original prescription of @xcite , where the orbits are assumed to be completely circular .",
    "this case can be understood as an upper limit to ac .",
    "the program provides the necessary resolution for comparison with our data , i.e. , down to @xmath132 .",
    "the input parameters are @xmath133 , the baryon fraction enclosed within @xmath8 , the baryon scale length and the initial concentration of the dark matter halo , @xmath17 .",
    "we take the baryon fraction as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 denotes the stellar mass enclosed in the total reconstructed radial range . for the baryon scale length we use the fitted hernquist scale radius @xmath136 derived in section  [ sec : cm ] .",
    "this is preferred to making use of @xmath137 @xcite , because our measured @xmath20  derived from the petrosian radius  do not agree precisely with the half - light radius of hernquist profiles , which is a consequence of projected radii and circularized mass profiles .",
    "furthermore , the hernquist profile is originally used for the surface brightness distribution , whereas we fit in this case surface mass profiles .",
    "the @xmath138 best - fit values turn out to be mostly lower but close to @xmath139 .",
    "we run the contraction routine for a grid of parameters @xmath140 ranging from @xmath141 to @xmath142 in steps of @xmath143 .",
    "we then fitted the contracted profiles , via eq .",

    "@xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "[ fig : acw ] ]    there are a number of uncertainties entering the analysis :    1 .",
    "since the radial extent of a reconstructed profile is limited to 2 times the angular @xmath19 and a finite resolution , the aperture size changes from lens to lens , 2 .   in order to mimic the limited probed range ( henceforth called aperture ) by an equivalent range in the contracted profile , @xmath19 must be expressed in units of @xmath8 , 3 .",
    "baryon fraction as well as baryonic scale length depend on @xmath12 and @xmath8 which are extrapolated quantities with their respective uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : ac ] shows the results for three scenarios of adiabatic contraction . the leftmost panels show initial versus final ( i.e. contracted ) halo concentration .",
    "the top row corresponds to the original proposal of @xcite ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 , i.e. , no correction for anisotropic orbits ) . in this case",
    ", we illustrate the increase in concentration as a blue line for fixed values of @xmath133 and @xmath151 .",
    "the growing concentration towards low @xmath17 is a consequence of the interplay between radial aperture ",
    "i.e. the extent of the extrapolation  and the region affected by ac .",
    "the smaller the initial concentration the larger @xmath152 towards small radii for the same @xmath133 ( we refer to this as the _ ac - sensitive case_. ) . as @xmath17 increases the difference between final and initial profile subsides .",
    "note that in our analysis , the further out we can probe the halo , the less affected is the fit and the extrapolation .",
    "however , for different combinations of @xmath133 and @xmath151 , similar curves fill the grey - shaded region . to enable proper differentiation with respect to initial concentration",
    ", we choose different shades of gray .",
    "the middle ( rightmost ) panels show the final concentration versus baryon fraction ( baryon - to - virial radius fraction ) .",
    "the gray shaded regions map the same areas as those in the leftmost panels .",
    "the black dots with error bars represent our data . for the @xcite case ( top )",
    ", there is clearly a disagreement between observationally inferred and contracted profiles .",
    "especially the low-@xmath133 and low-@xmath151 regions show significant departure from even the lowest final concentrations of the generic haloes .",
    "the middle row of figure [ fig : ac ] shows the ac prescription of @xcite , that implements eq .",
    "[ eq : fudge ] with fiducial values @xmath153 and @xmath154 to take into account eccentric orbits .",
    "this phenomenologically motivated ansatz leads to smaller concentrations .",
    "there is still significant disagreement between data and simulated contraction .",
    "the behavior of @xmath155 as a function of @xmath156 for constant @xmath155 and @xmath133 is indicated by the solid magenta line . for the panels in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : ac ] , we changed the pre - defined values of @xmath127 and @xmath130 to 0.42 and 0.4 , respectively .",
    "the orange line shows for fixed @xmath17 and @xmath151 the final concentration as a function of @xmath133 .",
    "these values for @xmath127 and @xmath130 give good agreement with the lensing data even for low @xmath17 , between 1 and 10 . compared to the ac prescriptions shown in the top and middle rows , the range of final concentrations is narrower , corresponding to a shallower @xmath123-@xmath133 relation ( middle panels ) .",
    "the latter can be equivalently expressed in terms of mass not drawn into the central region @xmath157 .",
    "comparing mass profiles contracted according to @xcite with the @xmath158-case shows that the latter transports less mass ( @xmath159 of the virial mass ) into the central halo region , @xmath157 .",
    "+ one of the intriguing results of this study is that even with a simple assumption of a common , mass - independent initial concentration , most of the final concentrations can be explained if ( @xmath127,@xmath130 ) are conveniently adjusted and @xmath160 is allowed to vary within uncertainties .",
    "there are a variety of results we summarize in the following .",
    "* there is slight evidence for lenses with lower baryon fraction to require higher initial concentrations . * both smaller @xmath17 and smaller @xmath156 produce steeper @xmath161 curves .",
    "this effect is independent of the ac - sensitive case at very low @xmath17 ( explained above ) .",
    "* when @xmath127 and @xmath130 are reduced , @xmath161 and @xmath162 become flatter , i.e. the differently shaded @xmath17 regions of the leftmost panels are mapped to narrower regions in the middle and right panels .",
    "moreover their overlap is reduced .    to study how sensitive our results are to the radial range , we additionally provide in fig .",
    "[ fig : acw ] the results for reduced aperture sizes , i.e. @xmath147 and @xmath163 using the parameters @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "we find that even for the smallest radial range fits do not yield agreement with our lens data .",
    "the case that we underestimate the radial extend of our lenses by a factor of two is in light of the relatively small uncertainties of the mass profiles and the errors attached to @xmath28 unlikely .",
    "larger radial apertures yield even more disfavored final concentrations compared to our lens data .      for the weak ac case @xmath158",
    "we compare the number of different ( @xmath17,@xmath156 ) combinations producing final concentrations in agreement with our lens data and infer a @xmath17-@xmath12 plot as before , enriched by the information of the frequency distribution of initial concentrations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cmini ] ) .",
    "although most of the data can be reproduced even by few initial concentrations of @xmath164 , most of the ( @xmath17,@xmath151 ) combinations with high @xmath17 produce final concentration in agreement with @xmath123 and @xmath133 .",
    "the hue of the magenta column indicates the frequency distribution of @xmath17 values whereas the @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) confidence interval is highlighted by strongest ( faintest ) color .",
    "certainly , no strong quantitative conclusions can yet be drawn from these results , but judging by the confidence regions a strongly flattened @xmath167 relation seems likely .",
    "these results are in agreement with the inital halo concentrations estimated by @xcite , who used a simple model of spherical collapse . in that model , massive galaxies from density fluctuations between 2 and 3@xmath57  roughly mapping the same mass range as our lensing galaxies  were found with initial concentrations between 3 and 10 , with the most massive ones having lower concentrations .",
    "a flattened low - mass end of the @xmath1 relation is expected by simulations . to show this we include results from @xcite ( solid line and grey @xmath168 band in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmini ] ) .",
    "@xmath169 curves based on a toy model by @xcite for redshifts in a range from 0 to 1.4 are in good agreement with results from n - body simulations .",
    "the toy model includes the free parameter @xmath170 which takes into account the contraction of the inner halo beyond that required by the top - hat formation scenario .",
    "this contraction parameter is fixed for all haloes in their simulation . the difference between",
    "the simulated and observed @xmath1 relation is a well - known issue and matter of ongoing studies .",
    "it is however worthwhile to mention that this discrepancy is even stronger for low virial mass . from the comparison between @xmath17-@xmath12 found in this study and simulations that investigate the redshift - dependence",
    ", we can conclude that adiabatic contraction alone is not enough to explain the slope of the relation .",
    "strong gravitational lensing on galaxy scales constitutes a powerful tool to characterize dark matter haloes .",
    "in addition , combining photometric studies with stellar population synthesis allows us to assess the interplay between baryons and dark matter in the central regions of galaxies .",
    "this paper extends the work of lfsf  by exploring in detail the concentration of the dark matter haloes of 18 massive early - type lensing galaxies . on a concentration - virial mass diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cm ] ) we find these haloes to confirm and extend towards lower masses the relationship observed in x - rays by @xcite .",
    "our sample includes information about the baryon fraction , enabling us to explore the validity of adiabatic contraction prescriptions , such as the one of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we find that the standard modelling gives rather high final concentrations compared to our observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ac ] ) .",
    "a tweak of the parameters in the ac prescription of @xcite cause the gain in mass of the central region ( @xmath157 ) to be @xmath171 lower than in the previous case , which helps to solve the discrepancy .",
    "furthermore , this results in a rather flat relationship between initial concentration ( i.e. pre - ac ) and halo .",
    "we emphasize that this paper focusses on the fundamental aspect of adiabatic contraction caused by the collapse of the baryons during the formation of the haloes .",
    "additional mechanisms acting later , arising from dynamical interactions @xcite or stellar feedback resulting in the expulsion of baryons ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may alter the inner slope of the dark matter halo , although these mechanisms are expected to be more important in lower mass galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the tweak in the ac prescription of @xcite could be interpreted as one of these mechanisms playing a role in the evolution of the structure of the haloes . in any case",
    ", our analysis suggests that adiabatic contraction can explain only part of the @xmath13-@xmath12 trend but is unlikely to be the sole origin of it .",
