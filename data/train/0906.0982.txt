    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are of broad interest .",
    "they serve as physically interesting end points of stellar evolution , are major contributors to galactic chemical evolution , and serve as one of astronomy s most powerful cosmological tools .",
    "it is therefore unfortunate that the identity of the progenitors of sne ia is still uncertain .",
    "for example , without knowing the progenitors , the time scales of sne ia enriching the interstellar medium with iron remains highly uncertain .",
    "but it is the crippling impact on the cosmological application of these objects which is especially profound ; it is impossible to predict the consequences of any cosmological evolution of these objects or even gauge the likelihood of such evolution occurring .",
    "there is broad agreement that the stars which explode as sne ia are white dwarfs which have accreted material in a binary system until they are near the chandrasekhar mass , then start to ignite carbon explosively , which leads to a thermonuclear detonation / deflagration of the star .",
    "it is the identity of the binary companion that is currently completely undetermined .",
    "suggestions fall into two general categories @xcite :    * single degenerate systems in which a white dwarf accretes mass from a non - degenerate companion , where the companion could be a main - sequence star , a subgiant , a red giant , or possibly even a subdwarf . *",
    "double degenerate systems where two co white dwarfs merge , resulting in a single object with a mass above the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the detection of circumstellar material around sn  2006x @xcite has provided support for the single degenerate model in this case , although the lack of substantial hydrogen in several other sne ia @xcite poses more of a challenge to this scenario .",
    "these models also make different predictions for the nature of the system following the explosion . in the double degenerate case ,",
    "no stellar object remains , but for a single white dwarf , the binary companion remains largely intact .    in the single degenerate case , the expected effect of the sn on the donor star has been investigated by @xcite , who have calculated the impact of a sn ia explosion on a variety of binary companions .",
    "@xcite have explored many of the observational consequences of the possible scenarios , and podsiadlowski ( 2003 ) has presented models that follow both the pre - supernova accretion phase and the post - explosion non - equilibrium evolution of the companion star that has been strongly perturbed by the impact of the supernova shell . to summarize these results , main - sequence and subgiant companions lose 1020 % of their envelopes and have a resulting space velocity of 180320 kms@xmath2 .",
    "red - giant companions lose most of its hydrogen envelope , leaving a helium core with a small amount of hydrogen - rich envelope material behind , and acquire a space velocity of about 10100 kms@xmath2 .",
    "have used a binary stellar evolution code on a main - sequence star and exposed the evolved star to a sn ia .",
    "their simulations show that even less material is stripped due to the compact nature of a star that evolved in a binary .",
    "we will use their results where applicable .",
    "* henceforth rp04 ) have identified what might be the donor star to tycho s sn , a sn ia which exploded in the milky way in 1572 .",
    "these authors presented evidence that this star , star - gby their naming convention , is at a distance consistent with the tycho supernova remnant ( henceforth snr ) , has a significant peculiar radial velocity and proper motion , roughly solar abundance , and a surface gravity lower than a main - sequence star .",
    "however , star - g  is located at a significant distance from the inferred center of the remnant , and any process that has displaced the star must preserve the remnant s nearly perfectly circular projected shape . during the final stages of refereeing of this paper",
    "we were made aware of the article by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth gh09 ) , who used keck hires data to better constrain star - g s stellar parameters , and in addition , found an enhancement in nickel abundance , relative to normal metal rich stars .",
    "@xcite have looked for fe absorption lines from the remnant , using nearby stars as continuum sources , with the hope to better constrain the distance of these stars to the snr . with their technique",
    ", stars in the remnant s center should show strong blue - shifted fe absorption lines , formed by material in the expanding shell of fe - rich material from the sn , moving towards the observer .",
    "stars in the foreground would show no fe absorption , and background stars both red- and blue - shifted absorption .",
    "their study shows that star - g  does not contain any significant blue - shifted fe absorption lines , suggesting that star - gis in the remnant s foreground .",
    "however , these observations and their analysis , while suggestive , can not be considered a conclusive rebuttal of star - g s association with the remnant ; this technique requires a significant column depth of fe which is not guaranteed .",
    "a lack of fe column depth may be indicated by the fact that no stars were found in the vicinity of the remnant that showed both blue- and red - shifted absorption lines .    to further examine the rp04  suggested association of star - g",
    "with the sn ia progenitor , we have obtained a high - resolution spectrum of the star using subaru and its high dispersion spectrograph @xcite .",
    "we summarize , in section 2 , the observational circumstances of the tycho remnant and any donor star , and argue in section 3 that rapid rotation is an important , previously unrealised signature in a sn ia donor star . in section 4",
    "we describe our subaru observations .",
    "section 5 covers the analysis of data and the results of this analysis .",
    "section 6 compares the relative merit for star - g  being the donor star to the tycho sn or being an unrelated background star , and in section 7 we summarize our findings and motivate future observations .",
    "rp04  have done a thorough job summarizing the relevant details of the tycho remnant .",
    "the remnant shows the characteristics expected of a sn ia based on its light curve ( measured by tycho brahe himself ) , chemical abundances , and current x - ray and radio emission @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : overview ] we have overlaid radio contours on an optical image and have marked the position of the stars mentioned in this and rp04 s work .    although it is not easy to measure the remnant s distance precisely , rp04  estimated tycho s snr distance to be @xmath5kpc , using the ratio of the sn 1006 and tycho snr s angular sizes and their relative ages , and the direct distance measure of sn 1006 by @xcite ( 2003 ) . @xcite",
    "have recently shown , from a spectrum of a light echo associated with the sn1572 , that this sn was a normal sn ia .",
    "using tycho s observed light curve , the properties of sn ia as standard candles , and an extinction value they find a distance to the sn of @xmath6kpc .",
    "updating their values for the extinction values determined in this paper ( section [ sec : distmod ] ) , as well as using an absolute magnitude for sn ia of @xmath7 @xcite , we find a distance of @xmath8kpc . in summary",
    ", we believe the remnant s distance is poorly constrained , but probably between 2 and 4.5kpc .",

    "we note that @xcite have classified star - g  as an f8v star ( @xmath20k , @xmath21 , @xcite ) , in significant disagreement with the rp04  temperature and gravity .",
    "we believe the gh09   values are based on by far the best data , and for the purpose of this paper , we will adopt their values .    based on the observations",
    ", rp04  asserted that star - g  was located at approximately @xmath22kpc  consistent with the remnant s distance .",
    "they note that this star has solar metallicity , and therefore its kinematic signature was not attributable to being a member of the galactic halo .",
    "they further argued that star - g s radial velocity and proper motion were both inconsistent with the distance , a simple galactic rotation model , and the star being part of the disk population of the milky way .",
    "the derived physical characteristics of the system were nearly identical to what was proposed by podsiadlowski ( 2003 ) for a typical sn ia donor star emerging from a single degenerate system ( e.g. , u sco ; also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the revision in the stellar parameters by gh09  leads to different distance with a larger uncertainty , but by and large , has not altered the conclusions above . taken in total ,",
    "the data provide a rather convincing case for the association of star - g  with the tycho sn .",
    "in the single degenerate sn ia progenitor channel , mass is transferred at a high rate from a secondary star onto a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "these high mass - transfer rates require that the secondary star overflows its roche lobe . due to the strong tidal coupling of a roche - lobe filling donor , the secondary",
    "is expected to be tidally locked to the orbit ( i.e. , have the same rotation period as the orbital period ) . at the time of the sn explosion ,",
    "the donor star is released from its orbit , but will continue with the same space velocity as its former orbital velocity and continue to rotate at its tidally induced rate .    .",
    "]    there is a simple relationship between the secondary s rotation velocity @xmath23 and its orbital velocity :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the ratio of the secondary s roche - lobe radius to the orbital separation ( e.g. , given by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath26 is the mass ratio of the components at the time of the explosion .",
    "figure [ fig : theorot ] shows the rotational velocity as a function of secondary mass for several values of @xmath27 ( consistent with rp04s measurement , and at the low end of values expected for a subgiant star ) , where we assumed that the exploding white dwarf had a mass of @xmath28 .",
    "this estimate is strictly speaking an upper limit , as it does not take into account the angular - momentum loss associated with the stripping of envelope material by the supernova and any bloating due to the supernova heating .",
    "the latter would reduce the rotational velocity to first order by a factor equal to the bloating factor ( i.e. the ratio of the new to the old radius ) , but the star would likely find itself in a state where its radius and temperature was atypical of a normal star .    according to the results of @xcite ,",
    "mass stripping is not likely to be significant if the companion is a main - sequence star or a subgiant .",
    "furthermore , following binary evolution of a main - sequence star , have shown that even less material is stripped . however ,",
    "if the companion is a giant , it would be stripped of most of its envelope .",
    "such a star would not show any signs of rapid rotation since the initial giant would have been relatively slowly rotating ; e.g. , if one assumes solid - body rotation in the envelope , the rotation velocity at @xmath29 will only be @xmath30kms@xmath2 for a pre - sn orbital period of 100d .",
    "moreover , the material at the surface may have expanded from its original radius inside the giant , further reducing the rotational velocity . however ,",
    "if the stripping is less than estimated by @xcite , then it is possible for the signature of rotation to persist for a giant , albeit at a much lower velocity .",
    "@xcite also showed that due to the interaction of the sn blast wave with the companion , the secondary may receive a moderate kick of up to a few 10kms@xmath2 , but this kick is generally much lower than @xmath31 and therefore does not significantly affect the resulting space velocity .    finally , we note that the observed rotation velocities are reduced by a factor @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the inclination angle .",
    "however , because the donor star s rotational axis can be assumed to be parallel to its orbital axis , a minimum observed rotation speed can be computed from the observed peculiar radial velocity ( observed radial velocity minus the expected radial velocity of an object at that distance and direction ) .",
    "it is only if the orbital motion ( and hence final systemic velocity ) is solely in the plane of the sky , that @xmath34 , and therefore , the observed rotation , approaches zero.[rotation_expl ]",
    "to investigate the rotational properties of star - g , we were granted time with the subaru telescope .",
    "our observations of star - g  were taken in service mode on the nights of 2005 10 17 and 2005 10 18 .",
    "9 spectra were taken with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a resolution of @xmath35 ( measured using the instrumental broadening of the thorium - argon arc lines ) , an exposure time of 2000 seconds each ( totalling to 5 hours ) and a signal to noise ratio of about 10 per pixel ( measured at @xmath36  with 0.1 pixel@xmath2 ) .",
    "the hds features two arms , with each arm feeding a 2-chip ccd mosaic .",
    "the blue arm covers 6170  to 7402  and the red arm 7594  to 8818 .",
    "an og530 filter was used to block contamination from light blueward of our observing window , and data were binned by 4 in both the spatial and spectral directions , resulting in a pixel size of 0.1  ( at 8000 ) by 0.55@xmath37 .",
    "data were pre - processed using tools provided by the hds team and then bias - subtracted .",
    "we created a mask from bias and flatfielded frames , where we isolated the echelle orders and flagged bad pixel regions .",
    "the data were flatfielded using internal quartz flats , and the 2-d images cleaned of cosmic rays ( and checked carefully by eye to ensure there were no unintended consequences ) using an algorithm supplied by m. ashley ( private communication ) .",
    "the spectrum of each echelle order was extracted using iraf echelle routines , with wavelength calibrations based around low - order fits of a thorium - argon arc .",
    "wavelength calibration of each extracted spectrum was checked against atmospheric o@xmath38 , and our solutions were found to be accurate in all cases to within 1 kms@xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , we lacked a smooth spectrum standard star for setting the continuum , and we resorted to calculating a median of the spectra ( 6  window ) and dividing the spectra through this smoothed median .",
    "this unusual method was chosen over the common approach of fitting the spectrum with a polynomial , due to the special characteristics of this observation ( low signal to noise ratio , and a complex instrumental response ) .",
    "while this does not affect the narrow lines our program was targetting , it does affect broad lines such as the h@xmath39 and the caii ir triplet .",
    "the final step was to combine all spectra and remove any remaining cosmic rays ( in the 1d spectra ) by hand .",
    "to attain the rotational velocity of the candidate star , we measured several unblended and strong ( but not saturated ) fe i lines in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "since our spectrum only had a combined signal to noise ratio of approximately 10 , we added the spectra of the lines after normalizing them to the same equivalent width .",
    "as a reference we created three synthetic spectra ( one broadened only with the instrumental profile , the others with the instrumental profile and @xmath40 of 10 and 15 kms@xmath2  respectively ) with the 2007 version of moog @xcite , using gh09 s temperature , gravity and metallicity .",
    "we use a standard value of @xmath41 for the limb darkening although the choice of this value is not critical , which we confirmed by checking our results using significantly different values of @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ fig : sunobjrot ] shows the comparison between the synthetic spectra of different rotational velocity and the spectrum of star - g . we have scaled the synthetic spectrum using the equivalent width .",
    "this comparison indicates that the stellar broadening ( rotational , macro turbulence , etc . ) is less than broadening due to the instrumental profile of 7.5 kms@xmath2 , and therefore we adopt 7.5 kms@xmath2  as our upper limit to the rotation of the star .",
    "if one were to adopt rp04 s measurements of the peculiar spatial motion , it could be concluded that @xmath34 is much closer to 1 than 0 ( see the end of section [ rotation_expl ] for further explanation ) and thus that the rotational speed is @xmath43 kms@xmath2 .",
    "kms@xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]   kms@xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]      to determine the radial velocity , we used 63 lines to measure the shift in wavelength .",
    "we find a radial velocity in the topocentric ( mauna kea ) frame of reference of @xmath44 kms@xmath2(the error being the standard deviation of 63 measurements ) .",
    "the conversion from the topocentric to the galactic lsr for our observations was calculated to be 13.6 kms@xmath2  ( iraf task rvcorrect ) using the iau standard of motion . including the uncertainty in the lsr definition , we find a radial velocity in the lsr for star - g  of @xmath45 kms@xmath2 .",
    "this is in significant disagreement with that reported by rp04 , but agrees with the revised value published by gh09 .",
    "rp04  have measured a significant proper motion for star - g  of @xmath12 masyr@xmath2 , @xmath46  masyr@xmath2 . because star - g  is metal rich , and at a distance of @xmath47kpc , this measurement provides one of the strongest arguments for star - g  being the donor star to tycho sn .",
    "it is almost impossible to account for this proper motion , equivalent to a @xmath48 kms@xmath2  or 3 times the disk s velocity dispersion of @xmath49 kms@xmath2 , except through some sort of strong binary star interaction .",
    "however , the _ hst _  data present an especially difficult set of issues in obtaining astrometry free of systematic errors . for star - g",
    "these issues include the psf on the first epoch wfpc2 image being grossly undersampled , both the acs and wfpc2 focal planes being highly distorted , poor and different charge transfer efficiency across the two _ hst _  images , and that star - g  was , unfortunately , located at the edge of one of the wfpc2 chips , making it especially difficult to understand the errors associated with it .",
    "smaller issues include the small field of overlap between the two images , making the measurement subject to issues of the correlated motions of stars , especially in the @xmath50 direction .    to cross - check rp04 s proper motion of star - g",
    ", we have scanned a photographic plate taken in september 1970 on the palomar 5 meter , and compared this to an isaac newton 2.5 m telescope ( int ) ccd archive image ( int200408090414934 ) of the remnant taken in august 2004 .",
    "the palomar plate has an image fwhm of @xmath51 , and the int image @xmath52 .",
    "while our images have a much larger psf than the hst images , the images have significantly less distortion , are matched over a larger field of view with more stars , have fully sampled psfs , and were taken across nearly an 8 times longer time baseline .",
    "the photographic nature of the first epoch does add complications not present in the _ hst _  data .",
    "the non - linear response of photographic plates causes their astrometry to have systematic effects as a function of brightness @xcite , especially affecting objects near the plate limit , where single grains are largely responsible for the detection of an object .",
    "the position of stars on the int image were matched to the 2mass point source catalog @xcite to get a coordinate transformation ( pixel coordinates to celestial coordinates ) using a 3rd - order polynomial fit with an rms precision of 40 mas with 180 stars .",
    "this fit is limited by precision of the 2mass catalog and shows no systematic residuals as a function of magnitude , or position . using this world",
    "coordinate system ( wcs ) transformation , we then derived the positions of all stars on the int image .",
    "the coordinates of 60 uncrowded stars on the palomar plate were matched to the int - based catalog , and a 3rd - order polynomial was used to transform the palomar positions to the int - based positions .",
    "the fit has an rms of 65 mas in the direction of galactic longitude , and 45mas in the direction of galactic latitude .",
    "we believe the larger scatter in the direction of galactic longitude is due to the shape of the psf being slightly non - symmetric in the direction of tracking on the palomar plate .",
    "this tracking ( in ra , which is close to the direction of galactic longitude ) , causes the position of stars to depend slightly on their brightness .",
    "this explanation is supported by a small systematic trend in our astrometric data in @xmath50 , not seen in @xmath53 , as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the trend in @xmath50 is caused by the average motion of stars changing due to galactic rotation as a function of distance , which is proxied by @xmath54 .",
    "we have used the besanon galactic model to estimate the size of any such effect , and find the observed effect is an order of magnitude larger than what is expected . the systemic difference between assuming",

    "no such absorption was seen in the spectrum of star - g , potentially placing it in front of the remnant .",
    "however , the amount of fe i currently within the remnant is uncertain with predicted column densities spanning several orders of magnitude ( @xmath73 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , we have shown the rotation of star - g  is low ( confirmed by gh09 ; @xmath74 kms@xmath2 ) , arguing against association with the sn , as does its off center placement in the remnant . finally ,",
    "gh09  have presented evidence that star - g  is strongly enhanced in nickel , an observation that , if confirmed , would strongly point to an association of the star with the sn .",
    "if either the high proper motion , or significant nickel enhancement can be confirmed , then it is likely that star - g  is the sn donor star .",
    "otherwise , we believe it is much more likely that star - g  is simply an interloper .      while the case for star - g s association with the sn is not conclusive , it is intriguing , and we believe it is worthwhile to look for a consistent solution assuming the association is true . while not apriori probable , a self - consistent model can be constructed in which star - g  was the companion , as we shall discuss now .",
    "to make such a model work , star - g  has to be a stripped giant that presently mimics a g2iv star . at the time of the explosion",
    ", the star would have been a moderately evolved giant ( in a binary with an orbital period @xmath75d ) .",
    "the sn ejecta will strip such a giant of almost all of its envelope @xcite due to its low binding energy ; only the most tightly bound envelope material outside the core will remain bound . due to the heating by the sn , even this small amount of material ( perhaps a few @xmath76 ) will expand to giant dimensions , and the immediate - post - sn companion will have the appearance of a luminous red giant . however , because of the low envelope mass , the thermal timescale of the envelope is sufficiently short that it can loose most of its excess thermal energy in 400 years and now have the appearance of a g2iv star @xcite .    a lower mass for star - g  ( @xmath77 ) also reduces the distance estimate , and makes the observed radial velocity more unusual for stars at this distance .",
    "the expected spatial velocity depends on the pre - sn orbital period and should be in the range of @xmath78kms@xmath2 for a period range of @xmath79d @xcite .",
    "these velocities are consistent with the inferred spatial velocity of the object relative to the lsr if star - gis at the distance of the remnant , even if no significant proper motion has been measured ( see figure [ fig : bes_d_mu ] ) .",
    "a stripped - giant companion would link the progenitor to the symbiotic single - degenerate channel @xcite for which the symbiotic binaries tcrb and rs oph are well studied candidates .",
    "indeed , @xcite argued that the ultracool low - mass helium white dwarfs ( with masses @xmath80 ) that have been identified in recent years are most likely the stripped - giant companions that survived sn ia explosions , which could provide some further possible support for such a scenario for star - g .",
    "if the association is real , star - g s displacement to the se of the geometric center of the remnant as defined by radio and x - ray observations might be interpreted as being due to the remnant s interaction with an inhomogeneous ism .",
    "deep optical images of the remnant do show extended diffuse emission along the eastern and northeastern limbs interpreted as shock precursor emission @xcite .",
    "this along with an absence of detected balmer - dominated optical emission along the whole of the western and southern limbs suggests a density gradient of the local interstellar medium with increasing density towards the ne .",
    "an east - west density gradient has also been inferred from detailed radio expansion rate measurements @xcite .",
    "such an e  w density gradient could have led to a more rapid expansion toward the west giving rise to a small shift in the apparent geometric center away from the se without creating a highly distorted remnant . however , there are problems with this explanation",
    ". deviations from spherical symmetry in both radio and x - ray images of the remnant are relatively small @xcite , and the remnant is most extended along the eastern and northeastern limbs , just where one finds the greatest amount of extended diffuse optical emission .",
    "moreover , the remnant s expansion rate appears lowest toward the northeast ( pa = 70 degrees ) , not the southeast @xcite .",
    "although the argument that star - g s se displacement from the remnant s current geometric center is a result of an asymmetrical expansion is not strong , it remains a possibility .",
    "the most conclusive way of confirming a stripped - giant scenario for star - g  would be an independent , precise measurement of the distance to star - g  which in combination with measurements of the gravity and effective temperature would help to constrain star - g s mass .",
    "unfortunately , such a measurement will most likely have to wait for the advent of the gaia satellite .",
    "alternatively , one may be able to single out a stripped giant from a normal g2iv star through nucleosynthesis signatures , specifically evidence for cno - processed material ( or other nucleosynthetic anomalies ) . while a normal g2iv star is unlikely to show cno - processed material at the surface , a stripped giant is likely to do so .",
    "unfortunately , the data presented here are not of adequate quality to explore the detailed properties of star - g s atmosphere .",
    "presently , we believe the evidence for star - g s association with the tycho sn is interesting , but not conclusive . a possible scenario",
    "if star - g  is the donor star , would be that of a stripped giant scenario discussed in section 6 . however , there are still other stars that have not been adequately scrutinized .",
    "@xcite have found a star ( rp04star - e ) which may contain blueshifted fe i lines , indicating their association with the remnant .",
    "unfortunately , the star has neither a significant peculiar radial velocity ( @xcite ; rp04 ) nor a significant peculiar proper motion ( rp04  and confirmed by our work ; see table [ tab : prop_motion ] ) .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of each candidate in the remnant s center is necessary to precisely determine each star s physical parameters .",
    "however , the small observed velocities of the remaining stars suggest that the donor star would have needed to be a giant at the time of explosion . using rp04",
    "s observed values , none of the stars in the remnant s center appear consistent with what is expected of a giant star as the donor star except possibly for star - a .",
    "we also note that there is an additional star present in archived hst images , not cataloged in rp04 , offset from rp04 s star a by 0.5@xmath37 e and 0.2@xmath37 n at @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "this star , near the remnant s centre , has a color consistent with an f - star ( assuming that it is behind the bulk of the line of sight reddening ) , but it will require adaptive optics to obtain its spectrum given its proximity to the 13th magnitude star - a . this star could potentially be a non - giant progenitor .    if future observations are unable to pinpoint a viable donor star , other progenitor scenarios will have to be considered .",
    "these include the double degenerate scenario , or a scenario where there is a long time delay between the accretion phase of a donor star onto the white dwarf , and the ultimate supernova explosion .",
    "we would like to thank the subaru hds team for taking these observations in service mode .",

    "<S> it is widely believed that type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) originate in binary systems where a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star until its mass approaches the chandrasekhar mass and carbon is ignited in the white dwarf s core . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , by comparing images that were taken in 1970 and 2004 , we measure the proper motion of star - g  to be @xmath3masyr@xmath2  and @xmath4masyr@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that all of the measured properties of star - g  presented in this paper are consistent with those of a star in the direction of tycho s sn that is not associated with the supernova event . </S>",
