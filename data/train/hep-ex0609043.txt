    "the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a central component of the standard model of elementary particle physics .",
    "it accounts for the strong nuclear force in terms of the exchange of spin - one entities known as gluons ; these carry a quantum number known as `` colour '' and are exchanged between themselves and between the fermions referred to as quarks , which carry electric as well as colour charge .",
    "there is a law of nature that the overall colour of a stable elementary particle must be zero .",
    "thus the quarks and gluons are never observed alone , but mesons are formed ( primarily ) from quark - antiquark pairs and baryons from three quarks or antiquarks .",
    "the quarks that provide the basic constitution and quantum numbers of a hadronic particle are known as valence quarks .",
    "when a high - energy electron ( or positron ) collides with a proton , as in the hera collider , the simplest nuclear reaction that can occur is that a quark is ejected to give a high - energy jet of particles .",
    "this is deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and is mediated by the exchange , between the electron and the quark , of a virtual photon , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "scattering processes can involve valence quarks , but can also occur by means of virtual quark - antiquark pairs that appear temporarily within the proton .",
    "indeed , the proton may be considered as consisting of a continuum of different combinations of partons , that is to say ( anti)quarks and gluons , and depending on how violently it is struck by the exchanged boson .",
    "thus the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the proton are functions both of the fraction @xmath3 of the protons taken by a given parton and of the virtuality @xmath4 of the exchanged boson .",
    "the hera collider has been operating at desy , hamburg , since the year 1992 .",
    "electrons or positrons are stored at 27.5 gev and collide with a stored proton beam of energy 920 gev .",
    "the experiments h1 and zeus are located at the collision points and record the various @xmath5 interactions that occur . over the years",
    ", the collider has achieved increasingly high luminosities which have enabled the different types of process to be studied in greater depth and detail . during 2001 - 2002",
    "an upgrade to the collider and experiments was carried out ; however , earlier analyses have continued and many of the results presented here come from these . using silicon and drift chamber systems ,",
    "each of the experiments is able to record tracks of charged particles emanating from the interaction point , supplemented by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters to measure the overall energy of jets and high energy single particles .",
    "the apparatus is asymmetric , with calorimetry in the proton ( forward , `` positive '' ) direction designed to record large hadronic energy deposition , and calorimetry in the electron ( `` negative '' ) direction aimed at measuring precisely the scattered electron . both electron and positron beams were used .",
    "tests of qcd at hera may broadly be considered as of the following kinds :    * the pdf s of the proton measured at different @xmath4 values should be consistent with each other , as described by the dglap equations .",
    "* cross sections for processes with different numbers of qcd vertices should be predictable . here ,",
    "in particular , we are looking at processes with different numbers of high transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) jets , many of which correspond to radiated gluons , each of which represents an additional qcd vertex .",
    "we note that the simple lowest - order ( lo ) dis process has no vertices involving gluons , and is purely electromagnetic or electroweak in nature once the pdf is known . * the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath7 , which acts at quark - gluon and gluon - gluon vertices , must be consistent when measured in different ways .",
    "the value of @xmath7  varies ( `` runs '' ) with the momentum exchanged at the relevant vertex , in a way specified by qcd theory .",
    "various types of process are useful for these studies . owing to the complexity of the qcd calculations ,",
    "the processes that can be calculated theoretically are those that involve perturbative expansions in terms of @xmath7 , starting at lo .",
    "even next - to - leading order calculations ( nlo ) are highly complex , however .",
    "many such calculations have now been completed , and a few nnlo calculations , with special methods ( resummation ) employed to take account of multiple initial - state gluon radiation from the proton system . since the running value of @xmath7  falls with the momentum exchanged in the collision process , high values of exchanged momentum are preferred , so - called `` hard '' processes .",
    "`` soft '' processes require a higher - order or non - perturbative approach which is not usually achievable from first principles .",
    "the following types of hard process have been studied particularly at hera ; more than one of these features may of course be present in a given reaction .    * dis processes , i.e.  those involving high @xmath4 of the exchanged boson . *",
    "processes involving high-@xmath6 jets .",
    "* the production of heavy - quark systems , i.e.  charm and beauty quarks . *",
    "hard diffractive processes in which the exchanged colour - neutral object may be treated partonically .",
    "a long - standing analysis program at hera has involved studying the pdf s of the proton by means of the ejection of one or more jets by the incident virtual boson . at lowest order ( lo )",
    "only a single parton is involved , and at a fixed @xmath4 value the process does not display explicit qcd features .",
    "however the variation of the pdf s with @xmath4 is given by qcd - governed evolution equations ( the dglap equations ) .",
    "these have been well verified in processes dominated by @xmath8 and @xmath9 type quarks .",
    "when inclusive jets are measured , the contributions from multi - jet final states are included , and here qcd - governed processes contribute .",
    "both h1 and zeus have published qcd - based analyses of the parton structure of the proton.@xcite    the two experiments have recently measured inclusive jet production to improved precision in high-@xmath4 neutral - current dis .",
    "it is convenient to perform dis jet measurements in the breit frame , in which the incoming virtual boson and proton define the event axis .",
    "if the outgoing state contains the proton remnant and just one jet , the latter then has no transverse momentum relative to this axis .",
    "high-@xmath10 jets in the breit frame therefore indicate a @xmath11-jet process which is sensitive to qcd physics .",
    "dijet measurements by zeus are shown in fig .",
    "[ zdisinjet06 ] for a range of exchanged boson virtualities.@xcite the jet cross sections have been evaluated as functions of several kinematic and jet variables and are well described by the nlo qcd calculation disent.@xcite the aim has been to identify regions of phase space where uncertainties from higher - order corrections are small , so as to facilitate the evaluation of improved gluon densities in the proton in global fits to the proton pdfs .",
    "h1 have used the nlo qcd program nlojet++ to represent their data at the parton level.@xcite it is performed in the @xmath12 scheme with five flavours , the effects of hadronisation being evaluated using the generators rapgap ( based on lo matrix elements ) and djangoh ( using the colour dipole model).@xcite used together with @xmath4-varying pdfs , this gives a good description of the data and allows a value of @xmath7 to be extracted by varying @xmath7 in the fits .",

    "[ zforj ] ) in an update of a previous analysis.@xcite they assign large values to the qcd scale uncertainties in the perturbative calculation , and these cover the discrepancies between the latter and the data .",
    "it is evident that there is a theoretical issue here which needs to be resolved , and as yet these measurements do not give clear evidence in favour of the ccfm model .",
    "+    at high values of @xmath4 , cross sections have been measured for charged - current dis using the newly developed polarised @xmath16 beams at hera ( fig .",
    "[ pola ] ) .",
    "the differences between the two cross sections as a function of polarisation are very evident and in agreement with the standard model , using the monte carlos ariadne and meps to describe the hadronisation effects .",
    "the earlier zeus nlo pdf analysis has been updated to include these data , and the resulting picture is entirely consistent .",
    "the particles in a jet are produced by the soft fragmentation of the initiating high-@xmath6 parton .",
    "the qcd processes involved here are highly non - perturbative and must be modelled phenomenologically , as is done in the leading - logarithm monte carlos pythia and herwig .",
    "however , harder radiation of partons within the jet can deform its shape from a long pencil - like object ( with high _ thrust _ ) into a form with broader and asymmetric characteristics .",
    "these can be described by various event - shape variables , whose values are given by an @xmath7-dependent term together with so - called power corrections to account for the soft effects and ensure that these are suitably merged on to the hard processes.@xcite both zeus and h1 have extended their measurements of a variety of event - shape variables,@xcite and have extracted values of @xmath7 together with a parameter @xmath17 which , according to power - correction theory , should be universal with a value of @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ evsh ] ) .",
    "differential distributions in the event shape variables have also been studied .",
    "the theoretical expectations are reasonably well observed in most of the event shapes measured , but there is a lack of consistency in the extracted @xmath17 and @xmath7 variables that may indicate a need for higher order terms .",
    "the two experiments also disagree over the detailed values extracted from their fits , apparently because different kinematic regions were used .",

    "subjet have been studied by zeus in neutral current dis .",
    "the jets were identified using the @xmath15 cluster algorithm in the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode in the laboratory frame .",
    "measurements of subjet distributions were carried out as functions of various kinematic quantities , including the ratio of the subjet transverse energy to that of the jet , and the differences between the pseudorapidities and the azimuth values of the subjet and of the jet .",
    "the measured distributions are used to study the pattern of parton radiation by comparing them with monte carlo models and perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "it is found that ariadne performs better than lepto - meps and that comparison with nlo predictions allows a confirmation that quark rather than gluon jets are mostly being observed ( fig .",

    "h1 have measured the correlations in the azimuthal angle when measuring two - jet final states in dis .",
    "this distribution is sensitive to additional parton radiation both in the initial state and from the outgoing hard partons .",
    "h1 find that the process is sensitive to higher order radiative processes and the simple nlo two - jet amplitudes are insufficient to describe the data .",
    "nlojet three - jet calculations give improvement but are still insufficient ( fig .",

    ", data of this kind can give information on the @xmath15-unintegrated parton densities within the proton .",

    "the inclusion of o(@xmath20 ) contributions increases the predictions by an order of magnitude when the two highest-@xmath10 jets are not opposite in azimuth .",

    "prompt photons are those that emerge directly from a hard scattering process , as opposed to photons found as products of decay processes or as soft radiation from an outgoing particle",
    ". they can give information about qcd processes in a more direct way than do jets , which require hadronisation effects to be allowed for in order to be interpreted as a measure of quark and gluon properties .",
    "following a first publication by zeus on prompt photons in dis , h1 have presented differential dis cross sections.@xcite they are obtained for photon transverse energies of 3 - 10 gev and laboratory pseudorapidities of @xmath21 - 1.8 , and the data are compared with the predictions of a new lo calculation@xcite , which gives reasonable agreement .",

    "predictions based on leading - logarithm parton - shower monte carlo models were compared with the data ( fig .",
    "[ zprp ] ) and were found generally to underestimate the cross sections for photons of transverse energy below 7 gev , while the nlo qcd calculations ( applying the jet algorithm to the partons ) agree with the data better . for higher transverse energies of the prompt photons",
    "both types of calculation are in good agreement with the data .",
    "h1 have measured the photoproduction of dijet systems with improved statistics ( fig.[hdij]).@xcite when the dijet mass is above 65 gev , the distributions in @xmath24 show a clear difference between the direct- and resolved - dominated samples . in direct processes , the incoming photon interacts with the proton by coupling to a high-@xmath10 quark line : the hard exchanged object is thus a virtual quark , with spin one - half . in resolved processes ,",
    "a parton from the partonic substructure of the photon interacts with a quark or a gluon from the proton , and the exchanged object is more likely to be a spin - one gluon .",
    "hence the qcd dynamics is different : a less steep @xmath24 distribution occurs in the direct case owing to the exclusively spin - half propagator .",
    "the data are well described by pythia , in which the qcd dynamics is of course inbuilt , rescaled by a factor of 1.2 ; this does not affect the shape of the distributions .",
    "an nlo calculation describes a variety of distributions to within 10%.@xcite     +    three- and four - jet final states have been measured in photoproduction at hera by zeus .",
    "the integrated luminosity of 121 pb@xmath25 represents over seven times the luminosity of the previous hera publication on three jets in photoproduction , while the four - jet photoproduction cross section has been measured for the first time and constitutes the highest order process so far studied at hera .",
    "the events have been studied for masses of the jet system greater than 25 gev and greater than 50 gev .",
    "a comparison with the pythia and herwig shows that a multiple parton interaction scheme is necessary , but that tuning to @xmath5 data is necessary ; this has been done with herwig but not yet with pythia ( fig .",

    "the three - jet cross sections have been compared to an @xmath26 perturbative qcd calculation.@xcite this describes the higher - mass region reasonably well but underestimates the data for jet system masses below 50 gev .",
    "the dominant process for heavy flavour production at hera is photon - gluon fusion : @xmath27 .",
    "the cross sections therefore depend strongly on the gluon density in the proton .",
    "there are two main theoretical approaches , namely the zero - mass variable flavour number scheme ( zm - vfns ) which is suitable for @xmath4 values much higher than the quark mass squared , and the fixed - flavour number scheme which allows for quark masses , but which in present implementations becomes inaccurate at high @xmath4 owing to large terms of the form @xmath28 in the perturbative expansion .",
