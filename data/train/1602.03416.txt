    "in the present paper we further study random two - dimensional sets that satisfy the conformal invariance property combined with the restriction property , following the work of lawler , schramm and werner in @xcite and the paper of wu in @xcite .",
    "measures that satisfy conformal restriction property were introduced and first studied by lawler , schramm and werner in @xcite : for a simply connected domain @xmath2 with two marked boundary points @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( we will say `` boundary points '' instead of prime ends in the present introduction ) , they studied a class of random simply connected and relatively closed sets @xmath5 such that @xmath6 intersects @xmath7 only at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "such a set ( or rather , its distribution ) is said to satisfy _ chordal conformal restriction property _ if the following two conditions hold :    * ( conformal invariance ) the law of @xmath6 is invariant under any conformal map from @xmath8 onto itself that leave the boundary points @xmath3 and @xmath4 invariant . * ( restriction ) for any simply connected subset @xmath9 of @xmath8 such that @xmath10 , the conditional distribution of @xmath6 given @xmath11 is equal to the image of the law of @xmath6 under @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is any conformal map from @xmath8 onto @xmath9 that leaves the points @xmath13 invariant ( property ( i ) actually ensures that if this holds for one such map @xmath12 , then it holds also for any other such map ) .",
    "see figure [ fig : two - point - restriction ] .     and @xmath14 is a conformal map from @xmath15 onto @xmath8 that leaves @xmath13 invariant .",
    "the conditional law of @xmath16 given @xmath17 is equal to the ( unconditional ) law of @xmath6 . , scaledwidth=78.0% ]    it is straightforward to check that if a random set @xmath6 satisfies this chordal conformal restriction property in one simply connected domain @xmath8 with boundary points @xmath3 and @xmath4 , then if we map @xmath8 conformally to another simply connected domain @xmath18 via some fixed deterministic map @xmath19 , then @xmath20 satisfies chordal conformal restriction in @xmath21 with boundary points @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( and property ( i ) ensures that the image law depends only on the triplet @xmath24 , and not on the particular instance of @xmath19 ) . hence , it is sufficient to study this property in one particular given domain @xmath8 , such as the unit disc or the upper half - plane .",
    "recall that conformal invariance is believed to hold in the scaling limit for a large class of two - dimensional models from statistical physics .",
    "a chordal restriction property can be interpreted as follows : on a lattice , one can associate to each set @xmath6 an energy , and the restriction property means that this energy of @xmath6 is `` intrinsic '' in the sense that it does not depend on the domain in which it lives but only on @xmath6 ( and the extremal points @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) itself . for example , for a simple random walk on a square lattice in a discretized domain @xmath8 , which is conditioned to go from one boundary point @xmath3 to another boundary point @xmath4 , the probability of a given path @xmath25 will be proportional to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of steps of @xmath25 .",
    "this weight @xmath26 is then intrinsic because it only depends on the path @xmath25 itself but not on the domain @xmath8 . as a consequence ,",
    "if we condition such a random walk excursion from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in @xmath8 to stay in a subdomain @xmath9 of @xmath8 which still has @xmath3 and @xmath4 on its boundary , then one gets exactly a random walk excursion from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in this smaller domain @xmath9 . in the continuous limit , the brownian excursion from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in @xmath8 ( or rather its `` filling '' in order to get a simply connected set ) does indeed satisfy chordal conformal restriction .",
    "chordal restriction measures therefore describe the natural conformally invariant and intrinsic ways to join two boundary points in a simply connected domain .",
    "lawler , schrammm and werner proved in @xcite that such measures are fully characterized by one real parameter @xmath28 ( here and in the sequel , this means that there is an injection from the set of conformal restriction measures into @xmath29 ) that can be described as follows . for each chordal conformal restriction measure",
    ", there exists a positive @xmath28 such that for all @xmath30 such that @xmath15 is again a simply connected domain and @xmath31 , one has @xmath32 ( it is straightforward to see that the product @xmath33 does not depend on the choice of @xmath14 among the one - dimensional family of conformal maps from @xmath34 onto @xmath8 that leave @xmath3 and @xmath4 invariant ) .",
    "conversely , it is easy to see that for each given @xmath28 , there exists at most one law of @xmath6 satisfying this relation for all @xmath35 .",
    "the more challenging part is then to investigate for which values of @xmath28 such a random set @xmath6 does indeed exist .",
    "lawler , schramm and werner showed in the same paper @xcite that such a probability measure exists if and only if @xmath36 , and they provided a detailed description of these measures : when the smallest value @xmath37 , it is exactly the law of chordal sle@xmath0 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in @xmath8 , so that @xmath6 is almost surely a simple curve from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath38 , they showed that @xmath6 is almost surely not a simple curve anymore ( the case @xmath39 is the aforementioned law of the filling of a brownian excursion in @xmath8 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) .",
    "in fact , they also described the law of the right boundary of @xmath6 for all @xmath40 in terms of a variant of sle@xmath0 ( the sle@xmath41 processes ) , which showed in particular that the boundary of all these random sets @xmath6 look locally like an sle@xmath0 or equivalently like the boundary of a two - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "intuitively , the larger @xmath28 is , the `` fatter '' the random set @xmath6 is .",
    "for instance , one can prove that @xmath6 will contain cut - points if and only if @xmath42 , see @xcite ( where the law of the left boundary given the right one is also described ) .",
    "these chordal restriction measures can in fact be viewed as special limiting cases of a larger class of restriction measures defined similarly , but with three marked boundary points instead of two ; this class will be the topic of the present paper : for a simply connected domain @xmath2 with three ( different ) marked boundary points @xmath13 and @xmath43 , we consider probability measures supported on simply connected and relatively closed @xmath5 such that @xmath44 .",
    "such a measure is said to satisfy the _",
    "trichordal conformal restriction property _",
    "if for @xmath45 such that @xmath9 is simply connected and @xmath46 , the law of @xmath6 conditioned to stay in @xmath9 is identical to the law of @xmath47 where @xmath12 is the unique conformal map from @xmath8 onto @xmath9 that leaves the points @xmath48 invariant , see figure [ fig : trichordal - restriction ] .",
    "one expects intuitively this family of measures to be larger ( ie .",
    "parametrized by more than one real parameter ) because condition ( i ) of the chordal case is no longer required , so that the measures are invariant under a smaller semi - group of transformations .",
    "is the conformal map from @xmath15 onto @xmath8 that leaves @xmath13 and @xmath43 invariant .",
    "the law of @xmath49 given @xmath17 is equal to the ( unconditioned ) law of @xmath6 .",
    ", scaledwidth=78.0% ]    before going into the details of this trichordal case , let us say a few words about the radial case studied by wu in @xcite .",
    "given that the group of conformal automorphism of a domain is three - dimensional , this is the other natural variant to consider : for two simply connected domains , if we fix one interior point and one boundary point for each domain , then there is a unique conformal map from one domain onto the other that sends both of the prefixed interior point and boundary point of one domain to the corresponding points of the other .    for a simply connected domain @xmath2 with an interior point @xmath3 and a boundary point @xmath4 ,",
    "one looks at probability measures supported on simply connected and relatively closed sets @xmath5 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "such a measure is said to satisfy _ radial conformal restriction property _",
    "if for @xmath45 such that @xmath9 is simply connected and @xmath52 , @xmath6 conditioned to stay in @xmath9 has the same law as @xmath47 where @xmath12 is the unique conformal map from @xmath8 onto @xmath9 that leaves the points @xmath13 invariant .",
    "wu showed that this family was characterized by two real parameter : for such measures , there exists @xmath28 and @xmath53 such that for all @xmath30 such that @xmath15 is again a simply connected domain that contains @xmath3 in its interior and @xmath4 on its boundary , one has @xmath54 she also showed that the range of admissible values of @xmath28 and @xmath53 is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the so - called disconnection exponent of @xmath28 .    among the natural conformal restriction measures , the trichordal case was in some sense , the only one that was left to be studied .",
    "if ones adds more marked points , then there will typically be no conformal map @xmath14 that fix simultaneously all these points .",
    "even if it is possible to define a similar notion of @xmath58-point conformal restriction , we will not be able to speak of one measure that satisfies conformal restriction , but one has to consider instead a family of measures indexed by conformally equivalent configurations of the @xmath58 marked points . for @xmath59 , the family of all families of @xmath58-point chordal restriction measures will be much bigger than that of chordal , trichordal or radial cases , and it will in fact be infinite dimensional . intuitively speaking , one can associate to a four - point restriction sample @xmath6 , an intrinsic conformally invariant quantity , such as the modulus @xmath60 of the quadrilateral @xmath61 in @xmath6 ( where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath43 and @xmath62 are the four marked boundary points ) .",
    "one can then weight the law of @xmath6 by any function @xmath63 with mean @xmath64 , one thus still gets a four - point restriction measure .",
    "indeed , dubdat computed in @xcite formulae about @xmath58-point chordal restriction measures which involve such functions @xmath65 .",
    "this will be further explained in the preliminary section ",
    "[ sec : dubedat ] .      as in the chordal and radial cases ,",
    "the goal in the trichordal case is to characterize all random sets satisfying the trichordal conformal restriction property .",
    "recall that one heuristic motivation is that one would like to describe all possible ways to connect three boundary points of a domain via random sets with `` intrinsic energy '' , and one major question is to see what the `` thinest '' sets @xmath6 look like .",
    "let us first make the following observation : if we consider @xmath66 three independent chordal restriction measures in @xmath8 that intersect @xmath7 respectively at pairs of points @xmath67 ,",
    "then the filling @xmath6 of @xmath68 obviously satisfies trichordal restriction .",
    "moreover , if @xmath69 respectively have exponents @xmath70 then @xmath71 this suggests that the family of trichordal restriction measures might depend on three parameters .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case .",
    "the following characterization is of the same type as the characterization of the chordal and radial cases :    [ prop : charac][characterization ] for each trichordal restriction measure , one can find three real numbers @xmath72 so that for all @xmath30 such that @xmath15 is simply connected and @xmath73 , one has @xmath74 conversely , for each @xmath75 , there exists at most one probability measure so that this holds .",
    "we then denote the law of @xmath6 by @xmath76 .",
    "let us insist on the fact that this result does not tell us for which values of @xmath28 , @xmath53 and @xmath25 such a @xmath76 exists .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper will be to give the exact range of @xmath72 for which @xmath76 exist and to construct the corresponding restriction sets .",
    "the exponents @xmath72 of the trichordal case play symmetric roles and are interrelated , as opposed to the radial case .",
    "let us first make a few comments :    * first note that the points @xmath48 cut @xmath7 into three arcs , namely @xmath77 and @xmath78 . if @xmath79 is a subset of the arc @xmath80 ( which is the case depicted in figure [ fig : trichordal - restriction ] ) , then it is easy to see that @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in order for the right - hand side of ( [ thm1 ] ) to be a probability , @xmath28",
    "can therefore not be much bigger than both @xmath53 and @xmath25 . by symmetry",
    ", this indicates that each of the three exponents needs to be bounded from above by a certain function of the other two . on the other hand",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath83 is always smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "hence , one can still say that in the symmetric family @xmath84 , the smaller @xmath28 is , the skinnier @xmath6 is ( because for each @xmath35 , the probability to intersect @xmath35 is an increasing function of @xmath28 ) . *",
    "another type of condition that one should expect is that @xmath28 , @xmath85 and @xmath25 should all be greater or equal to @xmath86 . intuitively , a random set @xmath6 with law @xmath76 should look like , in a infinitesimal neighborhood of one marked point ( say @xmath3 ) , a chordal restriction measure of the corresponding exponent ( which is @xmath28 in the case of @xmath3 ) . more precisely ,",
    "if we let the point @xmath4 tend to the point @xmath43 , the limiting measure can be proved to be equal to the chordal restriction measure of exponent @xmath28 . since chordal restriction measures of exponent @xmath28 as characterized by ( [ two - point - formula ] ) exist only for @xmath36 , the same condition should hold here .",
    "a natural question is what is smallest @xmath28 for which the measure @xmath87 exists . for the chordal case ,",
    "the measure of exponent @xmath37 corresponds to a simple curve , which is the thinest that one can obtain .",
    "if the measure @xmath88 exists , then the corresponding random set would a.s .",
    "be a simple curve near each of the boundary points @xmath48 .",
    "would the three legs of such an sle@xmath0 spider then merge at one single point in the middle or would there be a fat `` body '' set near the center ?",
    "the previously described method of taking the filled union of chordal restriction measures only constructs such measure with @xmath89 , which is unlikely to be the thinest choice .",
    "the answer to all these questions turns out to be somewhat surprising : a particular case of the following theorem is that that the smallest @xmath28 for which @xmath90 exists is actually @xmath91 . in this special case ,",
    "the corresponding random set @xmath6 consists of three parts , that have only one common point which is the unique _ triple disconnecting point _ :",
    "when one removes this point , one disconnects @xmath6 into three disjoint connected components , that respectively contain @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath43 .",
    "however , since @xmath92 , each of these three `` legs '' of this symmetric restriction spider are a bit `` fatter '' than simple curves ( even though they each of them will have quite a lot of cut - points ) .    before stating this main result ,",
    "let us first recall the formulas for the half - plane and whole - plane _ brownian intersection exponents _ that have been determined by lawler , schramm and werner in @xcite : @xmath93 we will use here only the formulas and not the interpretation in terms of non - intersection probabilities for brownian paths ( but the latter are of course related to restriction properties ) .",
    "[ thm : existence][existence ] the measure @xmath76 exists if and only if @xmath72 satisfy all the following conditions :    * @xmath94 * @xmath95 * @xmath96    furthermore , if @xmath6 is a random set with law @xmath76 , then    * @xmath6 has a triple disconnecting point if and only if @xmath97 .",
    "moreover in this case , each of the three legs away from this unique triple disconnecting point have almost surely infinitely many cut - points ( this can be viewed as a consequence of the that fact that necessarily , @xmath98 ) .",
    "see figure [ fg : tripple - cut - point ] .",
    "* the boundary point @xmath43 is a cut - point of @xmath6 if and only if @xmath99 .",
    "see figure [ fig : two - conditioned ] .",
    "+ 0.4   + 0.4     note that if we define @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 to be the respective image of @xmath28 , @xmath53 and @xmath25 under the monotone bijection from @xmath103 onto itself defined by @xmath104 , then one can easily express the conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) without reference to the brownian intersection exponents : the condition ( i ) becomes @xmath105 , condition ( iii ) becomes @xmath106 ( while ( i ) implied only that this sum can not be smaller than 9 ) , and condition ( ii ) becomes three inequalities of the type @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , all these conditions can be summed up as @xmath108    we have already highlighted to special role of @xmath109 . another interesting case worth mentioning is the measure @xmath110 ( that also exhibits a triple disconnecting point ) . our construction will in fact implicitly describe this measure as being constructed by an sle@xmath0 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , weighted according to its ( renormalized ) harmonic measure seen from @xmath43 ( this will make it more likely for the path to wander closer to @xmath43 ) , and to which one attaches a brownian excursion from @xmath43 to a point ( chosen according to this renormalized harmonic measure ) on this sle .",
    "in general , when @xmath111 , it is natural to guess that conditionally on the triple disconnecting point , @xmath6 consists of three radial restriction samples ( from the center point to the three points @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath43 respectively ) conditioned not to intersect each other except at this center point .",
    "however , in practice , it would be a rather tedious and intricate venture to define this conditioning rigorously , and we will not follow this route .    for the @xmath99 case , one can make a similar remark , and this time , it can be made rigorous more easily .",
    "it will indeed follow from our construction that conditioned on one branch of @xmath6 , the other branch is a chordal restriction sample in one of the connected components of the complement of the first branch . in this sense , one can view @xmath6 as the union of two chordal restriction samples conditioned not to intersect each other except at @xmath43 .",
    "an interesting example is of course @xmath112 , which corresponds to two chordal sle@xmath0 from @xmath3 to @xmath43 and from @xmath4 to @xmath43 , conditioned not to intersect .",
    "this ( and the three symmetric images when interchanging @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath43 ) is the only trichordal restriction measure that consists of a simple path in @xmath113 .",
    "the family of measure @xmath114 exists exactly in the range @xmath115 $ ] , and the two cases @xmath116 and @xmath112 that we have just briefly described are the two extremal ones .",
    "the case @xmath117 corresponds to ( the filling of ) the union of two independent sle@xmath0 curves from @xmath3 to @xmath43 and from @xmath4 to @xmath43 .",
    "as explained above , when @xmath25 increases , as opposed to the symmetric case , one can not really argue anymore that the sets @xmath6 become larger ( and indeed , the @xmath118 case corresponds to a simple curve , while this is not the case for @xmath119 ) .",
    "instead , when @xmath25 grows , the sets are in some sense `` pushed towards @xmath43 '' .",
    "the proof of the characterization result will follow somewhat similar ideas than in the chordal and than in the radial cases .",
    "the proof of the existence part will be divided in two parts : first , we will construct trichordal restriction measures for all admissible values of the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath53 and @xmath25 , and then we will see that if a measure @xmath120 exists for the non - admissible part , one gets a contradiction .",
    "our construction of trichordal restriction measures will rely on a special family of sle processes with driving functions involving hypergeometric functions , that we call hypergeometric sles and denote by hsle . zhan first defined in @xcite intermediate sles to describe the inverse of sle@xmath121 processes .",
    "the intermediate sles are hypergeometric sles with special parameters . in our case , for @xmath122 , the hsle curves correspond to the boundaries of trichordal restriction samples .",
    "the construction goes in fact through several steps .",
    "first of all , we define the notion of one - sided restriction ( in this trichordal case )  which is reminiscent and analogous to the one - sided chordal restriction measures that were studied by lawler , schramm and werner .",
    "we consider measures supported on simply connected and relatively closed @xmath123 such that @xmath124 is the union of the arcs @xmath125 and @xmath80 . for all @xmath126",
    "such that @xmath15 is again a simply connected domain and @xmath127 is a subset of the arc @xmath78 .",
    "such a measure is said to satisfy _ one - sided ( trichordal ) conformal restriction property _ if @xmath6 conditioned on @xmath17 has the same law as @xmath16 where @xmath12 is the unique conformal map from @xmath15 onto @xmath8 that preserves the points @xmath48 .",
    "see figure [ fig : one - sided ] .",
    "is the conformal map from @xmath15 onto @xmath8 that preserves the points @xmath48 . the law of @xmath16 conditioned on @xmath17 is equal to the ( unconditioned ) law of @xmath6.,scaledwidth=76.0% ]    one - sided restriction measures are also characterized by ( [ thm1 ] ) with three parameters @xmath72 and we denote the measure by @xmath128 . the range of @xmath72 for which the measure @xmath128 exists is larger than the range for which the three - sided restriction measure @xmath76 exists . in particular , since we only consider @xmath35 that intersect @xmath7 at the arc @xmath129 , there is nothing that prevents @xmath28 or @xmath25 to be much bigger than the other two exponents .",
    "moreover , some negative values of @xmath53 will be allowed .",
    "we will show that the range is the following :    a one - sided measure @xmath130 exists if and only if @xmath75 satisfy the following conditions : @xmath131 moreover , if @xmath6 has law @xmath130 where @xmath132 , then the point @xmath4 is on the right boundary of @xmath6 .",
    "these one - sided restriction measures @xmath128 will be constructed , in most of the cases , by a hsle@xmath0 curve .",
    "however for a certain range of parameters , this construction does not work , and we will use poisson point process of brownian excursions instead .",
    "next we will study two - sided restriction measures .",
    "their definition is similar to that of one - sided restriction , except that two - sided restriction measures are supported on @xmath6 such that @xmath133 is the union of @xmath134 and the arc @xmath80 , and the sets @xmath30 are such that @xmath127 is a subset of the union of the arcs @xmath78 and @xmath125 , see figure [ fig : two - sided ] .",

    "the two - sided restriction measures will be constructed , in most of the cases , as follows : construct first its boundary at one side ( say the right side ) which is a one - sided restriction measure , by a hsle , then conditionally on this side , sample an independent one - sided restriction measure in the connected component which is to the other side ( say the left side ) of the first boundary .",
    "however we will again use other methods to construct some limiting cases .    in order to prove that the hsle define such trichordal restriction measures , we will use a martingale - type argument , in the spirit of the proof of the chordal restriction measure construction .",
    "however , the technical implementation of this strategy can appear somewhat daunting , but things are not as bad as they look : one derives that a certain process is a local martingale by longish but straightforward it formula calculations ( having the a priori information that the computation should work out nicely ) and in order to be able to apply the optional stopping theorem , we have to prove that the semi - martingale is anyway bounded ( this is not obvious from the expression of the process as product of terms that are not bounded , but we have again the a priori knowledge that in the end , this quantity will be a conditional probability , so that it should be bounded ) , which one can then show using some a priori knowledge on the hypergeometric functions that we use .",
    "having a full description of all possible one - sided and two - sided restriction measures , we will be able to construct the family of three - sided restriction measures by first constructing the boundary on one side ( say the right side ) as a one - sided measure and then conditionally on this side , sampling a two - sided restriction measure in the connected component which is to the other side ( say the left side ) of this first boundary .",
    "the determination of the exact range of admissible parameters in one - sided and two - sided cases , will be obtained by investigating some geometric properties of the corresponding random sets that we construct in the limiting cases of the parameter - range . in the three - sided case",

    "this will be explained in  [ sec : three - sided ] .",

    "<S> it turns out that such a random set can not be a simple curve simultaneously in the neighborhood of all three marked points , and that the exponent @xmath1 shows up in the description of the law of the skinniest possible symmetric random set with this trichordal restriction property . </S>"
