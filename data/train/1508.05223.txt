    "with the development of xray  lasers , especially the state - of - the - art xray  free electron lasers  ( fels ) , the exploration of the interaction of intense and ultrafast x  rays with matter has become a scientific frontier  @xcite .",
    "the extreme pulse characteristics of operational xray  fels  such as the the linac coherent light source  ( lcls )  @xcite in menlo park , california , usa  are ultrahigh brightness , femtosecond pulse duration , short wavelengths and transverse coherence .",
    "these novel properties of x  rays spawned the subfield of xray  quantum optics  @xcite and enable the study of ultrafast multiphoton interaction of x  rays with matter .",
    "exploring atoms , molecules , and clusters irradiated by intense and ultrafast x  rays is of crucial importance for understanding their physical , chemical , and biological properties  @xcite .",
    "the intense x  rays from fels induce two - photon absorption  @xcite , rabi flopping  @xcite , photoelectron holography  @xcite , single - pulse pump - probe experiments  @xcite , and stimulated xray  raman scattering and four - wave mixing , suppress the branching ratio of auger decay  @xcite or produce interference effects in auger decay  @xcite .",
    "saturable  @xcite or frustrated absorption  @xcite reduces radiation damage of the sample and may thus be beneficial for diffraction experiments at fels  @xcite .",
    "the combination of intense and ultrafast x  rays with an optical laser offers perspectives for the control of auger decay  @xcite and xray  lasing  @xcite , high - order harmonic generation in the kiloelectronvolt regime  @xcite , and the production of high - energy frequency combs  @xcite .",
    "initially , atoms were studied in intense ultrafast soft xray  pulses from lcls  @xcite .",
    "neon was chosen as a prototypical atom  @xcite and it was found that , for sufficiently high photon energies , all atomic electrons are ionized by one - xray - photon absorption and atoms even become transparent at high xray  intensity due to rapid ejection of inner - shell electrons . concerning x  rays , we speak of an ionization _ from the inside out _ in contrast to strong - field ionization with intense optical lasers where ionization of the outermost electrons occurs with highest probability , i.e. , there ionization proceeds _ from the outside in_. the quantum dynamics of neon atoms in intense and ultrashort xray  radiation was successfully described theoretically with a rate equation model  @xcite foreshadowing extension to more complex systems .",
    "understanding the response of molecules to intense ultrafast x  rays poses substantial complications over the description of atoms  @xcite ; namely , in addition to photoionization and intraatomic decay processes for molecules , there are also molecular fragmentation , and sharing of the charges in the valence shells among the nuclei of  n@xmath0 which need to be regarded .",
    "the molecular dynamics induced by intense and ultrafast extreme ultraviolet  ( xuv ) , soft xray , and hard xray  radiation from fels , has been extensively studied in experiments during the last few years  @xcite .",
    "the first ever study of a molecule , namely nitrogen  ( n@xmath0 ) , in intense and ultrafast x  rays was performed at lcls  @xcite where n@xmath0 was chosen because it is an important but simple molecule .",
    "the experiment used x  rays with a wavelength of  @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 photon energy .",
    "we found that the absorption of x  rays is frustrated , i.e. , pulses with a comparable energy but decreasing duration lead to smaller average charge states compared with longer pulses and thus a reduced absorption of x  rays .",
    "unlike the xuv  photon energy regime in which multiphoton absorption causes single or multiple ionization  @xcite , usually only one - photon ionization occurs in the xray  regime  @xcite which is a substantial simplification of the problem .    to find a theoretical description of  n@xmath0 in lcls x  rays , we devised a series of phenomenological models of increasing sophistication , namely , a single - atom model , a symmetric - sharing model and , a fragmentation - matrix model to unravel the mechanisms of the interaction  @xcite .",
    "it was found that a single - atom model  which assumes that the molecular ion yields are the same as the ion yields that are obtained from a single atom  is not capable to describe the experimental data for  n@xmath0 due to a redistribution of valence charges over both n  atoms in the molecule after ionization and prior breakup .",
    "therefore , a symmetric - sharing model was tried next in which the molecular charge is distributed evenly between the two atoms .",
    "the model was found to lead to a similarly deficient description as the single - atom model .",
    "thus the insights gained from these two models were used to devise heuristically a fragmentation - matrix model in which there is only a partial redistribution of charges between the two atoms .",
    "this model clearly reveals the relevance of the redistribution of charge and a different weighting of electronic and nuclear dynamical processes on short and long time scales for similar nominal xray  pulse energy but varying pulse duration .    in this article",
    ", we study sequential multiple ionization of  n@xmath0 induced by intense and ultrafast x  rays from  lcls with similar nominal pulse energy but different pulse durations . in the theory  , we extend our modeling from  @xcite by devising a molecular rate - equation formalism in intense and ultrafast x  rays of ref .  @xcite is also based on molecular rate equations and was developed by oleg kornilov and oliver gessner .",
    "the rate equations in this work were devised independently and their results are consistent with the phenomenological models of  @xcite and further analysis of the experimental data in  @xcite unlike the previous attempt in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] to describe the ultrafast molecular dynamics .",
    "the molecular rate equations are formulated for neutral  n@xmath0 and molecular cations with single core holes  ( schs ) , double core holes  ( dchs ) on a single site  ( ssdch ) , and double core holes on two sites  ( tsdch )  @xcite .",
    "further valence ionized molecular configurations and even triple core holes round off the set of included molecular rate equations . in total",
    ", we consider all possible one - photon absorption and decay channels for molecular charge states up to  n@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we treat all molecular charge states beyond  n@xmath4 as fragmented into single atoms and we take all single atom charge states into account . by considering the finite lifetime of metastable molecular ions and the sharing of the valence electrons between the two nuclei of the molecules , the experimental ion yields and the average charge state",
    "are well reproduced in the results and discussion  .",
    "our present molecular rate - equation model shows that the different ionization dynamics observed for pulses of different durations are mainly due to the competition between photoabsorption , molecular fragmentation , and decay processes .",
    "the effective pulse energy at the sample and the rate of the dissociation of molecular ions are obtained with the molecular rate - equation model by comparing theoretical and experimental data .",
    "our rate - equation model represents an improvement over the fragmentation - matrix model  @xcite as it describes the quantum dynamics of the involved molecular charge states and the breakup process .",
    "the results from our model agree well with our earlier findings  @xcite .",
    "conclusions are drawn in  .",
    "all details of the molecular rate - equation model and the calculations in this article are provided in the supplementary data  @xcite .",

    "the molecular processes displayed are photoionization by one - xray - absorption  `` @xmath8 '' , dissociation of the metastable molecular ions  n@xmath3 with a fragmentation rate `` @xmath9 '' , auger decay of core - ionized states `` @xmath5 '' , and instantaneous fragmentation `` @xmath10 '' . in the last step of the interaction `` @xmath10 ''",
    "occurs , if no core holes are present in  n@xmath4 ; otherwise `` @xmath8 '' or `` @xmath9 '' take place . see text for details . ]    we develop a rate - equation description for  n@xmath0 in intense and ultrafast x  rays which includes the molecular processes schematically depicted in  .",
    "initially , all n@xmath0  molecules are in their ground state .",
    "the absorption of an x  ray creates the molecular cation  n@xmath11 which is frequently metastable with respect to dissociation .",
    "thus n@xmath11  remains a molecule until either another x  ray is absorbed or , if there is a core hole , auger decay takes place  @xcite . both processes",
    "promote  n@xmath11 to the dication  n@xmath3 .",
    "even  n@xmath3 that , in our case , is predominantly produced by auger decay , is frequently metastable with a comparatively long lifetime of  @xmath12 with respect to dissociation  @xcite .",
    "there are three channels for  n@xmath3 to evolve into ; first , n@xmath3  may fragment causing the end of the molecule ; second , an x  ray is absorbed , and , third , auger decay occurs . both second and third channels promote  n@xmath3 to  n@xmath4 .",
    "if n@xmath4 has no core holes , we assume that it fragments immediately into atoms ; otherwise , again xray  absorption and auger decay may occur turning  n@xmath4 into  n@xmath13 which is considered to fragment immediately into two n@xmath14  atoms  @xcite . from here",
    "onwards , only atomic fragments are considered and their further evolution is governed by atomic rate equations .",
    "molecular rate equations are formulated for  n@xmath0 incorporating the steps mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "altogether there are thirty - three molecular configurations from neutral  n@xmath0 to triply charged  n@xmath4 with different combination of the electronic configurations of the two atomic sites .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the atomic fragments after breakup is described with an atomic rate - equation model which is modified in order to funnel probability from the molecular rate equations into the atomic rate equations .",
    "all in all , we extended nine of the thirty - six atomic rate equations to describe the transfer of probability from molecular configurations to atomic configurations .",
    "the molecular and atomic rate equations incorporate all energetically accessible atomic one - photon absorption processes together with fluorescence and auger decay of multiply - charged nitrogen atoms  @xcite ; simultaneous multiphoton absorption  @xcite and multielectron processes such as shake  off  @xcite and double auger decay  @xcite , however , are neglected . in what follows ,",
    "we write down selected molecular rate equations to show the guiding principles .",
    "the complete set of equations is provided in the supplementary materials  @xcite .",
    "we specify probabilities  @xmath16 at time  @xmath17 for  @xmath18 to find a molecule in which the individual n  atoms have the electronic configurations  @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , which are abbreviated by  @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the tilde accent on  @xmath16 , thereby",
    ", serves do distinguish molecular from atomic probabilities .",
    "molecular configurations for  n@xmath0 are written succinctly as  @xmath23 holds , i.e. , only distinct molecular configurations up to a permutation are considered to avoid double counting . ] .",
    "xray  absorption by  n@xmath0 is governed by a single rate equation : @xmath24 with the total single - xray - photon absorption cross section  @xmath25 of an n  atom in configuration  @xmath21 where  @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28  denotes the neutral n  atom in the ground state .",
    "the factor of  @xmath29 accounts for the two atoms in  n@xmath0 and the minus sign indicates a depletion of  n@xmath0 in the ground state by xray  absorption .",
    "further , @xmath30 is the xray  photon flux at time  @xmath17 .",
    "the rate of depletion of the ground - state  n@xmath0 is  @xmath31 .",
    "note that the xray  flux has , in principle , both temporal and spatial dependence due to the longitudinal and transverse profiles of the xray  beam  @xcite .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we do not explicitly write spatial coordinates for the quantities involved but state all equations for a flux that depends only on time  @xmath30 .      for the singly - charged molecule  n@xmath11 with a sch , the governing rate equation reads @xmath33 where  @xmath34 stands for the one - xray - photon absorption cross section which causes an n  atom with the configuration  @xmath21 to transition into the configuration  @xmath22 . with  @xmath35",
    "we denote the total decay rate of an n  atom in configuration  @xmath21 to any final state .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of   is the rate of production of  @xmath36 by xray  absorption ; the second term describes the rate of depletion by xray  absorption ; and the third term represents the rate of decay . the multiplicity of the configuration is correctly accounted for in   by considering only  @xmath37 and not also  @xmath38 because @xmath39 .",
    "further molecular rate equations are formulated for the other included cationic configurations which are  @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; the resulting molecular rate equations are expressed analogously to  @xcite .",
    "only few nondissociated  n@xmath11 molecules were detected in the experiment  @xcite which justifies that we do not treat them as a channel but break them into atomic fragments at  @xmath42 .      for the dication  n@xmath3 with only valence vacancies ,",
    "we have the exemplary rate equation @xmath44 where  @xmath45 is the decay rate of the atom in configuration  @xmath21 into  @xmath22 . the fragmentation rate of the valence - ionized molecular dication  n@xmath3 is indicated by  @xmath9 which is assumed not to depend on the molecular configuration .",
    "thus when the probability to absorb sequentially two xray  photons within a few hundred femtoseconds is low for pulses with moderate xray  photon flux , it is a good approximation to assume that n@xmath3  fragments immediately into two atomic ions at the moment of their formation after auger decay or photoionization of  n@xmath11 .",
    "however , when this probability is not low , for pulses with high xray  flux , differences may arise because an additional x  ray is absorbed prior to dissociation .",
    "we assume that all  n@xmath3 eventually dissociate because only very few nondissociated  n@xmath3 molecules were detected in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "since  n@xmath3 dissociates either symmetrically into  @xmath46 or asymmetrically into  @xmath47 , the parameters  @xmath48 and @xmath49 are used to account for the probabilities to dissociate into the fragmentation channels    [ eq : fn2 + ] & & _ 2 ^ 2 + ^+ + ^+ , + & & _ 2 ^ 2 + ^ + ^2 + ,    with  @xmath50 .",
    "the molecular probability of  n@xmath3 upon breakup needs to be funneled into the atomic rate equations .",
    "for example , the atomic rate equation of a neutral n  atom has to be modified to @xmath51 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath52 is the probability to find an n  atom at time  @xmath17 in electronic configuration  @xmath22 .",
    "here  @xmath53 , @xmath54 stands for the neutral n  atom .",
    "the last term on the right - hand side of   is new compared with the atomic rate equation and it is responsible for funneling probability of neutral n  atoms due to molecular fragmentation from the molecular configurations  @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "similar modifications are made to the atomic rate equations for the configurations  @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "other atomic rate equations are not altered  @xcite .    for a valence hole and a sch on one atom , the dynamics is quantified by the molecular rate equation @xmath69 for a tsdch by @xmath70 and for a ssdch by",
    "@xmath71 we see from these expressions , that molecular fragmentation is not included when a sch or dch is present because the time scale is , in this case , determined by the decay time of the vacancies which is much shorter than the fragmentation time .",
    "the other dicationic configurations are  @xmath58 , @xmath60 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath59 , @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and @xmath74 ; the involved molecular rate equations are formulated in analogy to the above scheme  @xcite .",
    "further photoionization or auger decay of the molecular dication  n@xmath3 produces the trication  n@xmath4 .",
    "no bound states were found for  n@xmath4 ions in the midst of many coulomb repulsive potentials  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that those n@xmath4 ions with no core holes fragment into  n@xmath14 and @xmath76 at the instant of formation of  n@xmath4 by auger decay or photoionization . the probability for the formation of  n@xmath4 ions with no core hole is small due to small valence ionization cross sections at the xray  photon energy  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , n@xmath4  with core holes is still treated as a molecule , i.e. , no immediate fragmentation is assumed .",
    "the  n@xmath4 are only broken up by auger decay or photoionization because of the faster time scale of auger decay compared with molecular fragmentation .",
    "for the triply charged molecular configurations , with a sch and two valence holes , we have the exemplary rate equations @xmath77 a tsdch and a valence hole @xmath78 a ssdch and a valence hole @xmath79 and a ssdch and a sch @xmath80 the other tricationic configurations are  @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ; the resulting molecular rate equations are written accordingly  @xcite .      molecular effects are centered around the steps described in  , [ sec : cation ] , [ sec : dication ] , and [ sec : trication ]  @xcite . for even higher charge states ,",
    "the interaction is basically those of independent atoms and no molecular rate equations are formulated . instead",
    ", immediate fragmentation is assumed for the molecular tetracation  n@xmath13 where the four charges are shared equally between the two nitrogen nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the probability of the fragments is funneled into the atomic rate equations which govern the time evolution from this point onwards  @xcite .",
    "to predict ion yields and the average charge state of  n@xmath0 in intense and ultrafast x  rays , we use a number of computational parameters which were either taken from the experiment  @xcite or calculated  @xcite .",
    "the xray  field parameters used here are the same as in  @xcite ; namely , lcls x  rays with full width at half maximum  ( fwhm ) nominal pulse durations of  @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 at a photon energy of  @xmath2 . for @xmath93  pulses ,",
    "the nominal pulse energy in the experiment was given as  @xmath97 whereas the nominal pulse energy of  @xmath98 was specified for the other pulse durations .",
    "the expression for the beam profile of lcls pulses can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the dissociative photoionization cross sections of a sch in  n@xmath0 is known from experiments at third - generation synchrotrons  @xcite . from these",
    "we find  @xcite for the fragment ion ratios in   the values  @xmath99 and @xmath100 and use them to parametrize our rate equations to ensure that the ion yields approach the values of sch  decay from synchrotrons in the limit of low xray  intensities and fluences .",
    "auger and fluorescence decay widths and the corresponding transition energies , electron binding energies , and one - xray - photon absorption cross sections for multiply - ionized n  atoms are taken from  @xcite where they were determined with _ ab initio _ computations .",

    ", we calculate ion yields which are experimentally mensurable quantities .",
    "the ion yields of atomic fragments from molecules are the molecular ion yields @xmath106 which are defined as the normalized charge - state probability where @xmath107 is the probability to find the atomic cationic state with charge  @xmath108 .",
    "the ion yields are calculated for  @xmath42 when molecular breakup is always assumed ; then the probability for neutral molecules is taken to be that of neutral atoms , i.e. , all molecules are assumed to have fragmented into atoms . from the ion yields  ,",
    "we calculate the average charge state via @xmath109 it is an indicator of the amount of charge found on molecular fragments .    in the experiment ,",
    "the beam line transmission is not particularly well determined due to beam transport losses , which leads to a large uncertainty in the pulse energy actually reaching the sample ; it was estimated in the experiment that only @xmath110@xmath111 of the nominal pulse energy arrived at the sample  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effective pulse energy in our calculations is unknown and needs to be found by comparing theoretical results with experimental data .",
    "similarly , the rate of molecular fragmentation  @xmath9 needs to be determined by such a comparison for which we use lcls pulses with a fwhm duration of  @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "it was not possible to determine  @xmath9 from  @xmath93 and @xmath94  pulses as there is too little influence on the ion yields by fragmentation .",
    "thus the value of  @xmath9 from nominal @xmath96  pulses was used then .",
    "we jointly optimize the fragmentation rate and the effective pulse energy as a percentage of the nominal pulse energy with respect to the difference between experimentally and theoretically determined ion yields   and the average charge state  .",
    "for this purpose , we use the criterion @xmath112 the criterion   depends on the effective pulse energy  @xmath113 and the fragmentation rate  @xmath9 .",
    "it comprises the absolute value of the difference between the experimental  @xmath114 and the theoretical  @xmath115 average charge states and the absolute value of 16  times the difference between the experimental and theoretical ion yield of either  n@xmath116 for  @xmath117 or  n@xmath14 for  @xmath27 .",
    "the second summand in   causes the criterion to have a fairly sharp global minimum where the prefactor of  16 is somewhat arbitrary but chosen large enough to ensure that the second summand makes a large contribution thus effecting a good agreement between experimental and theoretical average charge states provided that simultaneously also the chosen experimental and theoretical ion yield agree well ; only  n@xmath116 or  n@xmath14  ion yields   are considered in the second summand because only these are influence directly by  @xmath9 [ and ] .",
    "the ion yields from higher charge states are only indirectly impacted by fragmentation  @xcite .",

    "it was found that the nominal pulse durations specified by the accelerator electron beam parameters  @xcite are substantially longer than the effective pulse durations at the sample  @xcite for which values for  @xmath9 are also given . as the dependence of @xmath93 and @xmath94  pulses on  @xmath9 is very weak , it was not possible to extract it from  . in order to obtain the effective pulse energy for the short pulse durations , @xmath130",
    "is fixed to the value for the nominal duration of the @xmath96  pulses and only the effective energy needs to be determined as a percentage of the nominal pulse energy by minimizing the differences between the experimentally and theoretically determined average charge states .",
    "the resulting effective pulse energies of the molecular rate - equation model are listed in  ; the percentages of the nominal pulse energies that effectively arrive at the sample lie almost in the range of  @xmath110@xmath111 which was specified in the experiment  @xcite .",

    "this means that the energy of the lcls pulses arriving at the sample decreases with the shortening of the pulse .",
    "comparing  @xmath122 and @xmath124 for a specific pulse duration reveals a noticeable difference which is due to the fact that different pathways contribute to these ion yields .",
    "for example , n@xmath116  ions are not only produced by   but , e.g. , also by valence ionization of  n@xmath116 and n@xmath14  ions do not only result from   but , e.g. , also from auger decay of a sch in a n@xmath116  ion .",
    "as neither n@xmath116 nor n@xmath14 are solely produced by molecular fragmentation , this causes a systematic error , if we use  , which can be estimated from the differences between the  @xmath9 in  .",
    "another source of error are the variations of  @xmath9 for a specific ion yield , e.g. , @xmath122 , obtained from  @xmath95 and @xmath96  pulses .",
    "this happens for two reasons : first , it is not certain that the values of the nominal lcls pulse durations have the same error and , second , the contribution of the non - fragmentation - related pathways varies when the pulse duration is shortened and the peak xray  intensity thus increases . the same holds true for the effective pulse durations which are not known particularly precisely .",
    "in contrast to the theoretical results from the fragmentation - matrix model  @xcite , which were found to depend on the pulse duration only weakly , for molecular rate equations the determination of  @xmath9 is sensitive to the actual pulse duration .",
    "this behavior is to be expected because  @xmath9 is related to the speed of dissociation with respect to the speed of photoionization which depends on the pulse duration .",
    "overall , we find  @xmath135 to be in the range of  @xmath136@xmath137 which is comparable to the value of  @xmath12 found in  @xcite .",
    "the time  @xmath135 is much longer than the lifetime of a sch of  @xmath138 but is faster than the time for sch production by photoionization for the  @xmath96  pulse which is  @xmath139 at the peak intensity . for the @xmath93  short pulse ,",
    "the lifetime of a sch of  @xmath138 is comparable with the time between two photoionizations of  @xmath140 whereas the rate of molecular fragmentation of  @xmath135 is an order of magnitude longer .",

    "which are obtained from our molecular rate equation model in the two extreme cases of  @xmath145 and @xmath146 together with the results of the single atom model and the experimental data .",
    "when the finite rate of molecular fragmentation of the metastable molecular dication  n@xmath3 is neglected , i.e. , @xmath145 , the molecular rate equation model still gives similar ion yield distributions as the experimental data .",
    "specifically , the theoretical ion yields follow the same trend as the experimental ones .",
    "yet we see clearly from  , that the rather good agreement for  @xmath93  pulses becomes progressively worse for longer pulses .",
    "this obervation reveals the increasing influence of the fragmentation time scale which eventually becomes comparable with the fwhm duration of the long pulses .",
    "conversely , the other limit of the fragmentation time scale is  @xmath147 which means that the metastable molecular dication without core holes   fragments immediately into atoms   at the instant of their formation .",
    "one can see clearly from   the large differences between the experimental results and the theoretical calculations .",
    "the ion yields in this limit agree well with the atomic rate equation model but poorly with the experimental data .",
    "specifically , the molecular rate equations in this limit do not describe the experimental observation that the ion yields of the lowly charged atomic ions are higher than those of the highly charged ions ( see  @xcite for details of the single atom model ) .",
    "as molecular breakup occurs immediately in   and and the hierarchy of molecular rate equations is quenched at   and all probability is funneled into the atomic rate equation   and several of the rate equations for the trication thus are not used . in other words , the metastability of the molecular dication plays an essential role in the interaction of  n@xmath0 with lcls xray  pulses , and its finite rate of dissociation must not be neglected .",
    "we also observe in   that the variation of the ion yields with the pulse duration is substantially reduced for the atomic rate equations which indicates that the heightened sensitivity to the pulse duration is due to molecular effects .",

    "the parameters are the same as in  . ]    in  , we display the average charge state  @xmath148 of   obtained from the experiment  @xcite and the molecular rate - equation model .",
    "it shows clearly that the model reproduces very well the decreasing tendency of  @xmath148 with the decrease of the pulse duration .",
    "this comes to us as no surprise because we fitted the theoretical  @xmath148 to the experimental value in order to determine the effective pulse energy at the sample . yet",
    "the results for which certain dch channels are closed are genuinely independent results . inspecting  , we find that the sch  channel determines the main character of the dependence of  @xmath148 on the pulse duration .",
    "it describes well the nuclear and electronic dynamics of  n@xmath0 for long pulses .",
    "that is because for , e.g. , the @xmath96  pulse , auger decay is the fastest process ; a core hole formed by photoionization of an inner - shell electron is typically refilled by auger decay before another core electron is photoionized .",
    "however , the restriction to only sch  channels significantly underestimates  @xmath148 for short pulses compared with the experimental result which can only be obtained by including the molecular configurations with tsdch and ssdch .",
    "this means that the sch channel fails to account for short and intense x  rays for which there is a larger probability of ionization of a second core electron before auger decay of the first core hole occurs . thus excluding dch channels",
    "causes a substantial underestimation of  @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , one can see from   and that tsdchs make a stronger contribution than ssdchs because of the larger cross section for the formation of a tsdch  as the xray  photoabsorption cross section of an atom with no core hole is larger than that with a single core hole  and the lifetime of tsdch is longer with respect to the lifetime of a ssdch  @xcite .",
    "there is a drop in  @xmath148 for short pulses compared with long pulses .",
    "this _ observed _ frustrated absorption is ascribed to three effects : first , the decrease in the xray  absorption cross section due to sch and dch formation , i.e. , the effect of frustrated absorption ; second , due to a predominantly symmetric sharing of the charges for short pulses upon breakup as the molecular ion remains intact during the interaction in contrast to long pulses with fragmentation in the course of the interaction ; and , third , the variation in pulse energy at the sample which drops substantially with shortening pulse duration [ ] . that the influence of the cross section variation is an important ingredient of frustrated absorption",
    "is revealed by inspecting the single - atom model in  @xcite in comparison with the symmetric - sharing model .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we would like to define frustrated absorption as the impact of the variation of the cross section due to single and multiple core hole formation on the ion yields and the average charge state .",
    "we also show  @xmath148 in   when the pulse energy is constant . in this case",
    ", the drop of  @xmath148 is only caused by the change of the breakup pattern and the effect of frustrated absorption .",
    "considered only  @xmath93 and @xmath94  pulses , there ought to be no significant change of the breakup pattern as the time scale for molecular dissociation of the metastable  n@xmath3 is much longer than the pulse durations .",
    "nonetheless , there is a pronounced drop of  @xmath148 for  @xmath93  pulse compared with  @xmath94  pulses which is ascribed entirely to frustrated absorption .",
    "of this work corresponds to figure  4 of  @xcite which shows the experimental  @xmath148 together with @xmath148  from the single - atom model which represents an upper limit to  @xmath148 and the symmetric - sharing model which provides a lower limit to  @xmath148 and the fragmentation - matrix model that reproduces the experimental  @xmath148 very well for short pulses but is less accurate for longer pulses as the fragmentation time scale is not explicitly included in the model .",
    "both the fragmentation - matrix model in table  i of  @xcite and the molecular - rate equation model in of this work predict a pronounced drop of the effective pulse energy with shortening nominal pulse duration of similar magnitude .",
    "a reanalysis of the experimental data of  @xcite in  @xcite confirmed the theoretically predicted drop in the effective pulse energy .",
    "the agreement between the fragmentation - matrix model and the molecular rate - equation model is not a coincidence ; it shows that the main physical effects are described and that there is a significant drop in the effective pulse energy with shortening pulse duration .",
    "good agreement between theoretical calculation and experimental measurement of the ion yields and the average charge state of  n@xmath0 for lcls pulses with varying durations was also obtained by in  @xcite saying that molecular rate equations were used . however , there , the molecular valence charge dynamics is different to here because there n@xmath13  ions were assumed to fragment into  @xmath149 or @xmath150 with different ratios of  @xmath151 versus @xmath150 which was claimed to be adjusted to obtain the best agreement with the experimental data in their calculation .",
    "furthermore , there the effective pulse energy at the sample was adjusted in the range  @xmath152@xmath153 of the nominal pulse energy  which was _ always _ [ see  ] taken to be  @xmath98 in  @xcite  for pulses with fwhm  durations of  @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "our computations reveal a stronger dependence of the average charge state on the pulse energy in the range  @xmath132@xmath154 of the nominal value for the pulse energy of different durations where the nominal pulse energy for  @xmath93  pulses was  @xmath97 and @xmath98 otherwise [ see  ] .",
    "the differences between the model discussed here and the model of  @xcite can not be explained by the fact that sase - type pulses were used in  @xcite instead of pulses with a gaussian temporal shape employed here .",
    "namely , the analysis in  @xcite reveals that the impact of the spikiness of sase pulses compared with a gaussian pulse is small and may be neglected in good approximation .",
    "we believe that two aspects of our model cause the observed differences .",
    "first , all possible one - photon absorption and decay channels of the molecular states up to  n@xmath13 are determined from _ ab initio _",
    "computations  @xcite and are included in our model and , second , the crucial dynamics of dissociation of the metastable molecular dication  n@xmath3 is considered by introducing phenomenologically the fragmentation rate  @xmath9 .",
    "we describe a detailed understanding of the interaction of intense and ultrafast x  rays with  n@xmath0 . for this purpose",
    ", we lay the theoretical foundation for the description of multi - xray - photon absorption by molecules in rate equation approximation and investigate theoretically the quantum dynamics of  n@xmath0 exposed to xray  pulses from lcls .",
    "the results are determined by the competition between photoabsorption , decay processes , and molecular dissociation for xray  pulses of varying duration and energy .",
    "molecular configurations up to trications are included in the model taking into account the fragmentation dynamics of the metastable molecular dications and the redistribution of the valence electrons between the two atomic nuclei upon breakup .",
    "atomic fragments after dissociation of the molecule are treated by atomic rate equations , i.e. , no molecular effects are regarded anymore .",
    "the molecular rate - equation model describes the ionization dynamics observed and allows us to calculate theoretical ion yields and the average charge state which are then compared with the corresponding experimental quantities .",
    "thereby , the effective pulse energy at the sample and the rate of fragmentation of the molecular dication  n@xmath3 are determined from a comparison with the experimental data .",
    "we find a substantial progression in the effective pulse energy which decreases pronouncedly from long to short pulses .",
    "the ion yields and effective pulse energies at the sample from the molecular rate equations agree well with those obtained previously with the fragmentation - matrix model of  @xcite .    in  @xcite frustrated",
    "absorption was _ observed _ as a drop of the average charge state for short pulses compared with long pulses . there",
    "the most pronounced impact on the average charge state is due to the variation of the effective pulse energy as our previous  @xcite and present analysis reveals .",
    "furthermore , for short pulses the molecular ions remain intact and fragment mostly in terms of symmetric sharing of charges whereas for long pulses fragmentation occurs frequently prior further absorption of x  rays leading to higher charge states in the latter case compared with the former .",
    "the effect of frustrated absorption describes the situation that core - hole formation reduces the probability for further xray  absorption .",
    "it makes a significant contribution as dch channels are more important for short pulses compared with long pulses .",
    "specifically , we find for long pulses , with relatively low xray  intensity , that photoabsorption is the slowest process , and decay of schs is much faster than the dissociation of metastable dicationic states ; then molecular configurations with schs dominate .",
    "an ensuing auger decay refills the sch and thus increases the chance for further photoabsorption in the course of the interaction with the pulse because the photoionization cross section of a filled core shell is larger than for an only partially filled core shell .",
    "conversely , for short pulses with relatively high xray  intensities , the rates of auger decay and photoionization are comparable . in this case , there is much larger probability for the production of  dchs by sequential absorption of two x  rays within the lifetime of the core hole .",
    "therefore , further xray  absorption is reduced  compared with longer pulses of the same effective pulse energy  causing a smaller population of higher charge states .",
    "thus frustrated absorption results in a pronounced drop of the average charge state in addition to the variation of the effective pulse energy and the variation of fragmentation patterns .",
    "we would like to point out that , although our molecular rate equation model works very well for the chosen xray  fel pulses at a photon energy of  @xmath2 , more experimental data are needed in order to assess the range of the photon energies in which our model stays valid .",
    "that is because the single - electron response model may become insufficient when the photon energy is high above the ionization threshold , since then multielectron effects such as shake off processes may become important  @xcite .",
    "similar models to the ones discussed in  @xcite and here should be used to investigate other diatomic molecules in order to find out how general our approach is and whether also heteronuclear molecules are well described . also",
    "the role of interatomic electronic decay  @xcite ought to be investigated in the future .",
    "we are confident that our theory can even be extended to molecules with more than two atoms in certain parameter ranges .",
