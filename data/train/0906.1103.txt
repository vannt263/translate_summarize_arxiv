    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the quantum theory of radiation and its interaction with matter , is a subject with far reaching impact in physics , from the calculation of the magnetic moment of the electron @xcite to the widespread use of diagrammatic tools in every corner of theoretical physics . however , despite this long tradition as a central paradigm in physics , qed continues to confront us with many new challenges as its modern reincarnations emerge as effective theories of strongly correlated many - body problems , from quantum spin liquids to high temperature superconductivity to graphene . back in feynman s",
    "day , we would have been very surprised if someone were trying to solve a relativistic problem with two speeds of light .",
    "these days , such problems are actually ubiquitous in modern theoretical physics , one example being the effective theory of low energy excitations in a correlated d - wave superconductor .",
    "that theory is equivalent to an _ anisotropic _ quantum electrodynamics in @xmath0 dimensions@xcite , in which different `` speeds of light '' appear naturally .",
    "furthermore , there are other systems in which the low energy description reduces to different versions @xmath1 , such as various forms of quantum spin liquids @xcite or the physics of graphene layers @xcite .",
    "all of these different problems share a common feature : they have a nodal structure that resembles a relativistic spectrum for the low energy excitations . however , a distinctive feature of the @xmath1 particularly relevant for cuprate superconductors is that it contains a significant intrinsic anisotropy , which exists due to the difference between the fermi and gap velocities ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is known that the _ fermionic _ anisotropy , @xmath4 , is irrelevant in the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) sense@xcite , as long as the system is in the _ symmetric _ phase of @xmath1 .",
    "this is the quantum - critical phase of the theory , in which strongly interacting massless fermions acquire anomalous power - law behaviors in their various correlation functions .",
    "the anomalous dimension exponents characterizing this unusual state are universal and typically depend only on the total number of fermion flavors , @xmath5 .",
    "this however is true only as long as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the critical number of fermions at which the fermion mass is dynamically generated via the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) .",
    "once csb takes place , the fermions are gapped and confined out of the physical spectrum .",
    "this heralds a different , massive phase of the theory which typically translates to a different state in the underlying condensed matter system .",
    "the results of ref . 7 are generally valid for arbitrary anisotropy as long as the number of fermions @xmath5 is sufficiently large or for small anisotropy when @xmath5 is greater than @xmath8 of the isotropic case .",
    "evidently , @xmath7 is an important number within the theory , not in the least because antiferromagnetic order in effective theories of high temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids generically arises via the above non - perturbative phenomenon of csb  for example , in the context of cuprates , the chiral mass generation corresponds to the onset of a spin density - wave order from within a quantum disordered d - wave superconductor @xcite while it describes the formation of the ne ' el antiferromagnetic state and a whole family of other order states in the context of quantum spin liquids .",
    "@xcite unlike the exponents of the critical massless phase , however , @xmath7 itself is not universal .",
    "consequently , an important question arises within the anisotropic @xmath1 : to what extent is the critical number of fermions , @xmath7 , which defines the boundary between broken and unbroken chiral symmetry , affected when such anisotropy is present ?    in this paper , our goal is to provide an answer to this question .",
    "of course , ours is not _ the _ answer , for two reasons .",
    "first , since @xmath1 is a strongly interacting theory its exact behavior is beyond our reach .",
    "second , since @xmath7 is not universal there are actually _ many different _",
    "s : the nominally irrelevant couplings within the @xmath1 theory of a quantum disordered d - wave superconductor@xcite are very different than those of lattice - based quantum spin liquids.@xcite furthermore , both these @xmath7 s are different from the _ intrinsic _ @xmath7 of the pure @xmath1 field theory considered here ( defined through balaban - jaffe regularization,@xcite for example ) . however , all these issues notwithstanding , even in the absence of the exact solution , it is still possible to make a rather accurate determination of the _ parametric _ dependence of @xmath7 on the anisotropy , once an `` exact '' @xmath7 is known for the isotropic case from a different source , say from numerical simulations .",
    "our goal is to devise a criterion for determination of @xmath7 within the anisotropic @xmath1 which , while not exact , still provides a rather accurate description of how the csb boundary changes as a function of the parameters of the theory .",
    "the philosophy here is similar to the one behind the ubiquitous lindemann@xcite criterion , originally proposed to predict the melting point of a solid . while not exact , the lindemann criterion has proven itself a remarkably accurate and useful in a wide range of situations , from classical to quantum solids , from wigner crystals to abrikosov vortex lattices .    to devise our criterion , we point out that mass generation is a consequence of the fermion - photon coupling strength in qed .",
    "this strength is generally renormalized from its bare value by virtual polarizability of the vacuum .",
    "relying on this fact , we propose a natural way to measure the strength of the gauge field by focusing on the matrix element that represents processes in which one photon is exchanged between two fermions .",
    "we stipulate that the csb and mass generation take place when this matrix element exceeds certain critical value . within the isotropic @xmath1",
    "this is manifestly an exact statement  the only unknown is the actual value of @xmath7 which we can either infer from a separate calculation or borrow from numerical simulations.@xcite once our `` lindemann criterion '' is calibrated in this fashion , we proceed to evaluate the appropriate matrix element in the anisotropic theory and propose that the csb takes place when this matrix element exceeds the _ same _ critical value .",
    "following the above procedure , our criterion allows us to derive the following main results : first , we show that @xmath7 is not just a function of the anisotropy @xmath9 , but also a non - monotonic function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 themselves .",
    "the reason behind this peculiar behavior is the existence of a third relevant velocity in the theory , the speed of light , @xmath10 , which naturally appears in the maxwellian action for the gauge field .",
    "we confirm our findings for @xmath11 by using the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation within the pisarski approximation;@xcite both results show the same functional dependence on @xmath3 in this regime .",
    "another result is that the critical number of fermions decreases even for @xmath12 , as long as @xmath13 .",
    "thus , in the context of the @xmath1 effective theory of underdoped cuprates , we generically expect a non - superconducting , non - magnetic pseudogap state to intrude prior to the emergence of antiferromagnetism as d - wave superconductor is underdoped toward half - filling .",
    "we start by defining the form of the anisotropic @xmath1 lagrangian and the main physical quantities that will be used in our calculations . the lagrangian is @xmath14 \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are four component spinors and @xmath16 is a gauge field . in condensed matter environment , eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) is the low energy effective theory of some strongly correlated electron system .",
    "for example , in a phase - disordered d - wave superconductor , the gauge field @xmath16 couples nodal bogoliubov - degennes - dirac fermions to fluctuating quantum vortex - antivortex pairs through a maxwellian action @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "@xmath18 are the standard gamma matrices , such that @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 for nodes @xmath23 respectively .",
    "fermi and `` gap '' velocities , @xmath24 and @xmath3 , define fermionic anisotropy at each node .    to make further progress we first focus our attention on a particularly simple case : the non - interacting one ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this case is equivalent to saying that the phase is rigid or that the departure point in our analysis is the fully - ordered superconducting state . in that case",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) is reduced to @xmath26 where a mass term has been introduced only for normalization purposes . in the end",
    "our results will be robust in the @xmath27 limit .",
    "the equations of motion for these non - interacting dirac fermions are : @xmath28 with @xmath23 . from this expression",
    "it is clear that the task of solving eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be performed independently for each fermion flavor @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "now , if we focus on @xmath31 , we can reduce the anisotropic equation of motion to the isotropic one using a simple change of variables @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the intrinsic fermionic anisotropy _ can not _ be removed in the case of the real d - wave superconductor once the gauge field is present , as can be seen from the definition of @xmath20 .",
    "we now outline how a typical perturbative approach for computing the effect of coupling to the gauge field works : starting from the solutions obtained for the problem in which @xmath25 , namely @xmath35 and @xmath36  both having the anisotropy encoded in their spatial oscillations  we will perturbatively introduce the field @xmath16 .",
    "first , we choose our free solutions for each node in the form @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where for convenience we have defined @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the eigenstates of eq .",
    "( 3 ) are then @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are standard fermionic annihilation operators , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the momentum and spinor indices , respectively . in the case of decoupled nodes , when @xmath25 , all the information about the anisotropy is encoded in the exponential factor .",
    "now , for finite momentum we can use the ansatz @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 for node @xmath29 .",
    "the spinors @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be found directly from the equation of motion @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "thus , applying @xmath55 and @xmath56 to @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively we can generate the needed solutions .    using these free fermions in the heisenberg picture",
    ", we now introduce the gauge field by employing the well - known formal solution of the scattering matrix @xmath59 , equivalent to : @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the time ordered operator and the normal order operation , respectively . the interaction hamiltonian density that couples fermion fields to the gauge field",
    "is given by @xmath63 now , as usual , we want to analyze the matrix element @xmath64 , where both the final and initial state are assumed to be eigenstates of the _ unperturbed _ hamiltonian .",
    "= 8.5 cm    using the heisenberg representation of the free fields @xmath65 and the wick s theorem , we recognize that the only relevant diagrams are the interactions photon - fermion and fermion - fermion , the so called direct scattering and the m@xmath66ller scattering .",
    "the calculation simplifies here because , due to its fluctuating nature , the contribution of @xmath16 to the first term of the @xmath59 matrix expansion forces the said matrix element to vanish .",
    "consequently , the leading contribution relevant for our purposes comes from the second order term where the contraction of @xmath67 with @xmath68 is nothing else but the photon propagator @xmath69 , which is the real space _ inverse _ of the polarization function @xmath70 where the diagonal nodal _",
    "`` metric '' _ @xmath71 is defined@xcite by @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . we will now demonstrate that this second order element of the perturbation theory can be used to gainfully define the `` strength '' of the fermion - photon interaction and determine the critical number of fermionic flavors @xmath76 , without ever solving the schwinger - dyson equation , even though a perturbative approach itself is condemned to failure .    in order to accomplish this , let us focus on the mass generation problem .",
    "it is well known that schwinger - dyson equation , fig .",
    "1(a ) , has a non trivial solution ( @xmath77 ) once the initially soft photon ( factor @xmath78 in the large @xmath5 limit ) becomes harder at a critical number of fermions , @xmath79 ; with @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "that means for @xmath81 mass will be dynamically generated and therefore chiral symmetry would be broken .",
    "the existence of anisotropy makes to analyzing the birth of a gapped state through the mechanism of mass generation using the schwinger - dyson formalism almost impossible , with the noteworthy exception of the isotropic limit and the so called small anisotropy case ( @xmath82,@xmath83 , where @xmath84 ) @xcite .",
    "our aim is to explore mass generation for arbitrary anisotropy , because this is the physically relevant regime .",
    "our technique is based on the observation that as we lower @xmath5 we are effectively making the photon interaction stronger .",
    "this is clear because the photon propagator contains a screening factor @xmath85 . from this simple observation",
    "we can see that mass generation is a phenomenon that is intrinsically tied to the strength of the gauge field ( photons ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    put simply , we can translate the meaning of @xmath7 into the following statement , which clearly is a necessary condition for mass generation : _ if the photon - exchange interaction is stronger than some threshold value _",
    "@xmath86 _ then the fermion mass will be dynamically generated_. this assertion clearly lacks the precision of a mathematical theorem but we now proceed to demonstrate that it has the practical virtue of a useful criterion .    the problem that we are facing is straightforward : how can we usefully quantify the @xmath87 of the gauge field ?",
    "the simplest way to measure the strength of a photon is to analyze a process in which one photon is exchanged . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will analyze the @xmath88 scattering mediated by one @xmath89 , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) which corresponds to the second order term in perturbation theory . thus using the @xmath7 borrowed from the isotropic limit , we define @xmath90 $ ] , the matrix element of the @xmath59 matrix evaluated at the isotropic limit , as the natural candidate to measure the strength of the photon .",
    "we can safely say that in an anisotropic theory mass will be generated at the critical strength defined by @xmath91 .    thus solving the equation , @xmath92 $ ] for @xmath76",
    ", we will find the influence of anisotropy on the critical number of fermion flavors . in the isotropic case",
    ", the choice of node will not make any difference , however in the anisotropic case the situation will be quite different . regarding the symmetries of the problem",
    "we must analyze the invariant , @xmath93 because nodal particles can be born indifferently in nodes @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "this quantity is invariant under the transformation @xmath94 , which is a physical symmetry of this problem .",
    "we now proceed to compute the first non zero matrix element @xmath95 . the second order process following from the s - matrix term , eq .",
    "( 6 ) is : @xmath96\\ ] ] which can be written ( integration with respect to @xmath97 and @xmath98 is implicit ) as a sum of terms of the type @xmath99\\ ] ] by applying wick s theorem to the previous expression terms with and without contractions are obtained .",
    "however , due to the fluctuating nature of the gauge field most of those terms will vanish",
    ". the survivor will be the one containing the contraction of the gauge field with itself .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to compute the matrix element : @xmath100 to evaluate such matrix element we must define the initial and final states of the system @xmath101 . as the strength of the photon should be independent of the states that we use to measure it , we are free to use @xmath102 which we already know from the free theory .",
    "the relevant matrix element is    @xmath103    where @xmath104 , with @xmath105 .",
    "the integral is to be performed over all the allowed @xmath106 , but we have one constraint that is the spectrum of the dirac fermions , @xmath107 , which allows us to further reduce the evaluation of this integral .",
    "the integration limits are fixed from the condition that the momentum transferred in the processes shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) can not be larger that the momentum of the incident particle , @xmath108 .",
    "we have set @xmath109 as an upper cut off .",
    "we have also verified that the only effect of choosing a different cut off for different spatial directions is that it makes the convergence slower .",
    "thus , using the invariant measure of the strength of the gauge field , it is straightforward to show that the ratio between critical number of fermions at velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 respect to the isotropic point is    @xmath110    thus , the critical number of fermions for the anisotropic theory is given by the product of , @xmath111 , and the critical number of fermions at the isotropic point @xmath112 . in principle , this measure of the strength of the gauge field depends on the initial momentum of the particles , but it turns out that the ratio between the strength of the gauge field with anisotropy and the strength of the gauge field without anisotropy @xmath12 is not sensitive to the momentum of the incident fermions , @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , all the calculated quantities converge to a fixed value for a fairly low momentum cut off , @xmath113 .",
    "it is important to remark that @xmath114 is gauge invariant due to the transverse nature of the photon .",
    "indeed we can do better . by isolating the leading divergent behavior of the scattering amplitude",
    "we have obtained that in the @xmath115 at the leading order in the large @xmath5 approximation , the ratio @xmath114 is given by :    @xmath116 + \\zeta_{2 } \\left [   \\mathbf{k}\\left(\\frac{v_f^2-v_{\\delta } ^2 } { 1+v_{f } ^2}\\right)+   \\mathbf{k}\\left(\\frac{v_{\\delta } ^2-v_{f}^{2 } } { 1+v_{\\delta}^2}\\right ) \\right ] \\label{result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath117^{1/2 } d \\theta \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mathbf{k}\\left(m\\right)=\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2 } } \\left[1-m \\sin(\\theta ) \\right]^{-1/2 } d \\theta \\\\ & & \\zeta_{1}=   -2\\left(\\frac { 1 -2\\left(v_{f}^2 + v_{\\delta } ^2\\right)- v_{f}^{2}v_{\\delta } ^2 + v_{f}^4 + v_{\\delta } ^4 } { 3\\sqrt{2 } \\pi v_{f}^{2}v_{\\delta}^{2}}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\zeta_{2}= \\frac{2 - 3\\left ( v_{f}^{2}+v_{\\delta}^{2}\\right)+ \\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{\\delta}^{2}\\right)^{2}+ v_{f}^{4}v_{\\delta}^2 + v_{\\delta}^{4}v_{f}^{2}}{3\\sqrt{2 } \\pi v_{f}^{2}v_{\\delta}^{2}\\sqrt{\\left(1+v_{f } ^2\\right)\\left(1+v_{\\delta}^2\\right)}}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the elliptic functions of first and second kind respectively , and the prefactors are polynomials that are symmetric under @xmath94 .",
    "thus @xmath114 is explicitly invariant under the transformation @xmath94 , as it must be .",
    "an important case is the one in which there is no @xmath118 @xmath119 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath120 . in this case",
    "all the integrals can be performed and the full divergent behavior of eq .",

    "( [ result ] ) when taking @xmath120 . in that limit the dependence on the fermionic velocities becomes particularly simple .",
    "@xmath122 to test the accuracy of our technique , the result is compared with the exact numerical integration in fig .",
    "3 , showing excellent agreement",
    ". for low speeds @xmath123 , our result suggest that the critical number of fermions increases .",
    "we discuss this case in more detail below . on the opposite limit when the gauge field velocity is small compared with the other two velocities the critical number of fermions goes to zero .",
    "= 8.0 cm    a non trivial dependence on the gauge field velocity was also found ; there are three different regimes depending upon the value of @xmath2 , with respect to @xmath10 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . for @xmath124 , the critical number of fermions increases , reaching unexpected values for large anisotropy , leading to a gapped state in this sector . on the other hand for @xmath125 , @xmath7 decreases and we can generically expect gapless excitations .",
    "the most unexpected result occurs if @xmath126 , in this case @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "even though we found small deviations with respect to the isotropic value near to @xmath129 , they do not change the integer part of @xmath7 ( see also fig . 5 ) .",
    "thus , in this regime large anisotropy will be completely irrelevant .",
    "= 7.5 cm    using @xmath130 , which is the integer closest to the gauge invariant critical number of fermions @xmath131 found by nash @xcite , we have obtained a phase diagram in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) space , fig .",
    "4 . in this plot",
    "it is clear that if both velocities are smaller than @xmath10 , the critical number of fermions never goes to zero .",
    "however , outside that square region @xmath132 for high anisotropies .    to show how important it is to consider the scale defined by @xmath10 we have also plotted @xmath133 for different values of @xmath2 ( @xmath134 ) that we kept fixed as @xmath3 was varied ( see fig . 5 ) . in this plot",
    "we make evident that @xmath10 is a relevant parameter which we are allowed to set to @xmath29 , however the detailed behavior of the system is not a simple function of the anisotropy , @xmath135 , but an explicit function of both parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in order to test our results we compare them with recent numerical work that has been done by thomas and hands ( t - h)@xcite in an attempt to understand how anisotropy can modify the properties of @xmath1 .",
    "the lattice ( euclidean ) version used by t - h includes an anisotropy which is intended to mimic the continuum model in the incarnation presented by lee and herbut @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 theory presented in lee s article is parametrized in terms of two quantities @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "taking into account that the lattice simulation is a non perturbative method that does not relay in any educated ansatz , t - h results strongly support our view of the phenomenon .",
    "still , we should mention that the critical anisotropy calculated by t - h using the anisotropic scaling is not , in the strict sense , quantitatively accurate in the context of cuprates , for two reasons .",
    "first , the scaling used brakes the crystal isotropy , or , in different words , their simulation is not invariant under flavor exchange .",
    "second , they assumed that the two fermionic velocities change little around the gauge field velocity @xmath163 . due to the collective nature of phase defects",
    "we expect that @xmath164 in cuprates @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand lattice simulations are always performed in finite lattices and therefore the correct comparison with our results should be done by considering both , an upper cut off and a lower cut off . in principle",
    "we are free to make the upper cutoff as large as we want but the lower cut off dependence may be important when comparing our results with finite lattice simulations@xcite . setting the upper cut off as @xmath165 then the lower cut off",

    "4 , the question that naturally arises is , which regime is the physically relevant one ? clearly our answer will depend on the ratio @xmath169 . at finite but still small temperature , @xmath61 , we can use the continuum vortex - antivortex coulomb plasma model in order to estimate the gauge field velocity . identifying the speed of light from the maxwellian form of the action for the gauge field we find that @xmath170 at finite @xmath61 , where @xmath171 is the density of vortices @xcite .",

    "the more striking problem about identifying the precise value of @xmath10 is that this velocity is a function of the correlation length , @xmath177 , but at the same time we know that @xmath178 , thus a self consistent treatment or knowledge of the correlation length from experiments will be needed to settle this problem and give an accurate phase diagram that identify the relevance of these different regimes .    to provide further evidence of our findings",

    "however , it will allow us to compare the qualitative behavior of the mass as a function of @xmath3 , for the case in which @xmath120 . in this case",
    "the sums can be performed analytically by going to cylindrical coordinates instead of spherical ones .",
    "the integration was performed over the shell defined by a lower cutoff @xmath181 and an upper cut off @xmath113 .",
    "thus the schwinger - dyson equation : @xmath182 can be solved in this rough approximation and the result is : @xmath183 which is a real number as long as @xmath184 .",
    "thus as long as the @xmath185 move faster than the photons the generated mass indeed does depend on @xmath3 .",
    "we expect that  given the fact the decay factor in pisarski s result is of order @xmath7  the correction found for that factor will give us the functional behavior of @xmath186 .",
    "thus , as @xmath187 we would expect that @xmath188 . this is consistent with the result obtained from the proposed criterion , eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "however , we should warn the reader that even thought a mathematical expression can be obtained for @xmath123 the nature of the system will change in this case , casting doubt on the validity of our criterion in that region . indeed , from s - d equation at the pisarski level approximation for low fermionic velocities , the self energy will acquire an imaginary part which can be interpreted as leading to a confinement@xcite for fermions of the theory .",
    "this instantly calls into question the validity of using a pure plane wave type solutions for the computation of the scattering process .    in this approximation ,",
    "the nature of the solution changes considerably at the point where @xmath83 .",
    "that is so because the radial integral gets a logarithmic contribution that is proportional to @xmath189 which overwhelms the leading contribution at the isotropic point .",
    "alternatively , in more physical terms , if photons and massless fermions move at precisely the same speed this is `` infinitely '' different than having the photons that move faster than fermions .",
    "in the latter case it is natural to expect an `` overscreening '' behavior , in which constant exchange of fast photons ultimately leads to confinement . on the opposite side , with fermions moving faster than photons",
    ", we expect photons to be less effective in screening the fermions , and thus less effective in generating their mass .",
    "we have also checked that in the isotropic limit the pisarski s answer obtains and thus our results are not an artifact of the parametrization used .",
    "so far , we have shown that mass generation has a non - universal behavior , which arise due to the breaking of lorentz invariance .",
    "thus , it is natural for a cautious reader to wonder if , once @xmath6 , the renormalized effective low energy theory is in fact lorentz invariant or not . to begin with we emphasize that the fact that @xmath135 flows to one by itself does not guarantee that the full lorentz invariance will emerge unless both @xmath10 and @xmath2 are set equal ; this in effect acts as an extra constraint .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "( [ bfunction ] ) and in fig .",
    "( [ rgflow ] ) where it is easy to see that even thought @xmath190 neither @xmath2 nor @xmath3 converge to @xmath163 unless the above mentioned extra constaint is imposed . to show that the full lorentz invariance is indeed restored we must prove that both fermionic velocities @xmath2 and @xmath3 flow to @xmath163 independently .",
    "it is easy to see that lorentz invariance can still be broken even with the fermionic anisotropy set to unity .",
    "let us assume that the bare values of the fermi and gap velocity are equal to each other but different from the gauge field velocity , i.e. @xmath120 , but @xmath191 .",
    "the lagrangian for this simplified theory is @xcite    @xmath192    by simple rescaling @xmath32 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 we can transform this theory into a new theory in which the fermionic part of the action remains fully isotropic but an anisotropic maxwellian term appears :    @xmath198    thus , the effect of having @xmath191 reduces to anisotropic couplings in the maxwellian self - action of the gauge field .",
    "we denote these couplings as @xmath199 .",
    "these two couplings can be interpreted as two anisotropic charges .",
    "such anisotropic charges can change the value of the critical number of fermions in the original theory , as already shown in eq .",
    "in contrast , within the isotropic @xmath1 , the critical number of fermions does not depend on @xmath200 .",
    "this is true as long as we have only one coupling constant , but once we introduce two different couplings this pleasing behavior is lost .",
    "= 8.3 cm    [ bfunction ]    this simple example shows that we can restore lorentz invariance in the fermionic part of the action at the expense of breaking the lorentz invariance of the maxwellian part .    to summarize",
    ", the above discussion shows that at a bare level there are two intrinsic anisotropies in this problem ; @xmath135 is the fermionic one , while @xmath201 is the maxwellian one .",
    "@xmath202 and @xmath203 are the couplings in the temporal and spatial directions respectively .",
    "thus at a bare level of the @xmath1 theory relevant for the cuprates there are four coupling constants @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 .",
    "we will now show that , even though they contain anisotropy both in the fermionic and maxwellian terms , in the large @xmath5 limit the relativity is ultimately restored , without any assumptions about the size of the anisotropy .    to make good on the above claim notice that the effect of fermions on photons is still described by eq .",
    "( 8) . however , the gauge field stiffness is now : @xmath204 where the anisotropic levi - civita symbol is defined as @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 .",
    "thus , the effective lagrangian of the theory can be written as : @xmath208 where the effect of fermions has been introduced through the polarization function .",
    "= 7.0 cm    [ rgflow ]    this expression allow us to find the renormalized couplings , comparing the original bare gauge field stiffness with the screened one : @xmath209 we find that to the lowest order in @xmath78 the renormalized couplings are : @xmath210 where @xmath211 , and @xmath212 .",
    "the above one loop renormalization of the anisotropic charges allows us to set up the renormalization group ( rg ) equations for the beta - functions describing the flow of different couplings .",
    "these equations are rather complicated and we have been able to fully solve them only numerically . however , the following result is rather simple and can be extracted in an analytic form : on general grounds we expect that the non trivial infra - red fixed point should remain once we introduce the anisotropy , even though its position in parameter space may change . in order to find the value of the renormalized couplings at the fixed point , we analyze the _ difference _ between the renormalized couplings of the maxwellian action @xmath213\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we now rearrange our rg equations so as to focus on the beta - function for this difference between the renormalized charges , @xmath214 , the above equation implies that @xmath215 + \\nonumber \\\\",

    ", it follows that : @xmath218 from where @xmath219 , and , given that the theory is fully invariant under the exchange @xmath94 , it follows that @xmath220 . putting this information back in the flow equations it is clear that @xmath221 and @xmath222 themselves diverge with the same slope at the fixed point , and therefore their ratio @xmath223 .",
    "this result shows that lorentz invariance is restored and thus the previous results@xcite remain valid .",
    "however , we have made it clear that the physics behind the restoration of full lorentz invariance follows a path more subtle than previously explored : at the infra - red fixed point the relativity is restored due to the _ interplay _ between the velocity and charge renormalizations , the velocity renormalization by itself being insufficient to fully restore relativity of the theory .",
    "we have proposed a simple criterion that allows an explicit computation of the critical number of fermions @xmath8 in a theory that contains intrinsic anisotropies .",
    "we have checked , at the pisarski s level approximation , that this criterion captures the functional dependence of @xmath224 in the case in which an explicit expression can be obtained from analytic calculations .",
    "our criterion suggests that lattice simulations should be performed in such a way that important symmetries of the theory , namely @xmath94 , are protected .",
    "otherwise , there is a danger of obtaining spurious results . in lattice @xmath1",
    ", it seems worthwhile to investigate the existence of a possible confined phase in the region of the parameter space where fermionic velocities are small compared with the gauge field velocity .",
    "another venue that remains to be explored , is the possible usefulness of similar criteria for the analysis of csb or other non perturbative phenomena in other physical systems that also feature anisotropic couplings .",
    "finally , we have shown that the velocity anisotropy in @xmath225 does affect the number of critical fermion flavors @xmath8 at which chiral symmetry is broken due to the phenomenon of mass generation , even though the large @xmath5 theory remains fully relativistic in its critical phase .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath7 is a non - monotonic function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and , depending on the specific value of the ratio @xmath169 , different regimes emerge .",
    "our results imply that if phase fluctuations destroy the superconducting order in underdoped cuprates , we should expect a protected chirally symmetric critical phase ",
    "i.e. the pseudogap within this theory  as doping decreases , before we reach the antiferromagnetic region in the phase diagram .",
    "details of how will this sequence take place depend on the specific value of the gauge field velocity @xmath10 for different compounds .",
    "we hope that our results will contribute to better understanding of the quantitative issues that surround the value of @xmath8 in various effective theories and motivate further research on the anisotropic incarnations of the @xmath226 theory .",
