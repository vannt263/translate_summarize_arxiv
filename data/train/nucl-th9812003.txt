    "the meson - cloud model plays an important role in dealing with non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics effects in the nucleon .",
    "it has been used by several groups to interpret momentum distributions of sea quarks in the nucleon @xcite , measured in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the standard approach is based upon the sullivan process @xcite , in which the only essential parameter is the cut - off in the pion - nucleon - nucleon vertex .",
    "originally the emphasis was mainly on the description of the isoscalar @xmath0 distributions .",
    "more recently , since the observed violation of the gottfried sum rule , showing an excess of @xmath1 over @xmath2 in proton , the interest focussed on the properties of @xmath3 in the nucleon , whose @xmath4 dependence was measured recently @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry in antiquark distributions has been interpreted mostly in terms of the pion - cloud model ( a review is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite ) , and also in a soliton model in the large-@xmath5 limit @xcite .    since pion properties are strongly affected by the nuclear medium , the pion cloud plays also an important role in modelling nuclear effects on deep inelastic processes .",
    "it was used in the past in connection with the emc effect @xcite , leading to a few percent enhancement of the structure - functions ratio around @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , most approaches predicted a nuclear enhancement of the pion field and hence the @xmath7 and @xmath8 distributions , leading to a noticeable increase in the predicted drell - yan ( dy ) cross - section ratio .",
    "on the other hand experimentally the dy scattering on nuclear targets @xcite did not show much evidence for enhancement over nucleon targets .",
    "several papers have dealt with this discrepancy , pointing out different mechanisms leading to reconciliation with the measurements @xcite .    for the purpose of presenting our results",
    "we find it convenient to separate them into two aspects .",
    "the calculation of experimentally measured proton - nucleus to proton - deuteron dy cross - section ratio is our first aim .",
    "the isospin asymmetric medium affects the various isospin states of the nucleon s pion cloud differently , leading to an excess of up antiquarks over down ones ( even if the distributions in free proton are identical ) for nuclei with more neutrons than protons .",
    "since the charges of up and down quarks are different , the effect also shows up in the nuclear dy scattering cross section .",
    "in addition to presenting the dy ratio , one can also investigate possible nuclear effects on the difference @xmath3 for a nucleon in the medium .",
    "it has been pointed out by kumano that in a neutron - excess nucleus there could be medium effects contributing to this difference , coming from flavor - asymmetric parton recombination in the small bjorken-@xmath4 region @xcite .",
    "the mechanism he considered contributes only at relatively small @xmath4 values ( @xmath9 ) and the effect is also rather small ( 210% of the observed asymmetric sea in the nucleon ) .    in the present calculation",
    "we extend the effective field theory approach to compute pion properties in isospin - symmetric nuclear medium @xcite to the case of arbitrary proton and neutron densities",
    ". then we use the pion - cloud model @xcite to compute the medium - modified quark and antiquark distributions and the proton - nucleus dy cross section .",
    "we assume that the medium effects solely originate from a modification of the pion cloud . and large @xmath10 , but this contribution is approximately flavor symmetric and",
    "thus should not modify our results significantly . ]",
    "the nucleons are treated in mean field approximation , while the delta - isobar and the pion are dressed self - consistently .",
    "the effects of short - range baryon repulsion are included through migdal s @xmath11 parameters ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "sensitivity of the pion distribution to the delta - hole self - energy was already recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , thus we carried out the computation with the self - consistently determined in - medium delta - isobar spectral function @xcite .",
    "we compute the pion light - cone momentum distributions separately for the three charge states as a function of the asymmetry parameter @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath14 the @xmath15 distribution exceeds that of @xmath16 , which in turn is larger than the @xmath17 distribution , as expected on the basis of particle - hole self - energy relationships .",
    "the drell - yan cross section for the process @xmath18 is given by ( suppressing the @xmath10 dependence ) @xmath19 dx_1dx_2 , \\ ] ] where the sum is over all flavors , and @xmath20 are the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by quark of the beam and target nucleons , respectively . by a suitable selection of kinematics",
    "the values of @xmath21 can be deduced from experiment @xcite .",
    "if we consider the region @xmath22 when the antiquarks in the projectile play a negligible role , the ratio of the proton - nucleus to proton - deuteron dy cross - sections takes on the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is close to unity . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are antiquark distributions in the free proton , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the antiquark distributions per nucleon in the nucleus , differing from the free - nucleon distributions by the medium modified pion - cloud contribution .",
    "denoting the latter by @xmath29 and @xmath30 the dy ratio becomes @xmath31   \\right\\}.   \\label{dyratio2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see from the above expression that apart from nuclear effects , leading to nonzero @xmath32 and @xmath33 , for @xmath34 there is a nucleonic one @xcite , stemming from the nonzero value of the antiquark - distribution difference @xmath35 in the free proton .",
    "this underlines the necessity to use parton distributions in accordance with latest @xmath36 observations ( for discussion on this point see section iv ) . for the relatively small asymmetries of interest for stable nuclei",
    "the ratio @xmath37 appearing in the above expression is practically independent of @xmath38 , leading to a linear dependence of @xmath39 on it .    for the change of antiquark distributions due to pion - cloud modification",
    "we use the convolution formula @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 , given by @xmath42 represents the change of the pion light - cone - momentum distribution per nucleon in the medium . @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) denote the distribution of @xmath47 per neutron ( proton ) in medium and in free space , respectively . they are discussed in the next section .",
    "we consider a model consisting of pions , nucleons and delta - isobars in an infinite , spatially uniform system at zero temperature .",
    "the proton and neutron densities are given through their chemical potentials @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the equilibrium conditions for nucleons , delta - isobars and pions imply that the chemical potential for the neutral pion is zero , while those of charged pions are : @xmath50 .",
    "the antiparticles of nucleons and isobars are neglected , but a relativistic kinematics is used .",
    "the nucleons are further treated in the mean - field approximation , with momentum - independent mass ( @xmath51 ) and energy shifts ( @xmath52 ) modelling their binding , i.e.  @xmath53 for neutrons and @xmath54 for protons .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations without vertex corrections are then solved self - consistently for the delta - isobar and pion @xcite .",
    "the pion self - energy consists of the particle - hole and delta - hole contributions , with both imaginary and real parts taken into account , assuring correct analytical properties .",
    "short - range baryon repulsion is taken into account through migdal s @xmath55 parameters .",
    "the sum - rules for spectral functions of pions and deltas are checked and found to be satisfied to 12% .",
    "the pion light - cone momentum distributions are then calculated , using the in - medium pion self - energy .",
    "direct calculation of the diagrams corresponding to the pion emitted by the in - medium nucleon proceeds analogously to ref .",
    "@xcite , but separately for the three charge states of the pion and taking into account different neutron and proton densities ( and thus different @xmath56 effective masses and @xmath52 energy shifts ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath57 can be expressed compactly in terms of an integral over the spin - isospin response function or imaginary part of the pion propagator .",
    "it is also possible to compute it directly from summing contributing diagrams @xcite , which represent emission of a dressed pion by a nucleon .",
    "the latter procedure we prefer for numerical reasons , since it needs computation of the pion self - energy in smaller energy - momentum region .",
    "the schematic expression for the pion light - cone distribution per nucleon has the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the sum of relevant diagrams , @xmath60 the nucleon density , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the momentum of incoming ( outgoing ) nucleon .",
    "the full expression generalizing the case for isospin - symmetric medium from @xcite reads ( for the special case of @xmath17 on proton ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the fermi momentum of the proton , @xmath66 the nucleon s mass , @xmath67 , @xmath68 the @xmath69 coupling and @xmath70 the form factor , while @xmath71 is the angle between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is the full pion propagator , corrected for the presence of four - fermion couplings through migdal s @xmath11 parameters , given as @xmath75 in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath76 if the argument of the square root is positive , otherwise is zero , and @xmath77 the expression for @xmath15 is obtained by swapping the indices @xmath78 and @xmath79 and for neutral pions the total distribution is a sum of two terms corresponding to emission by proton or neutron .",
    "the difference in distributions for the various charge states of pion basically comes from two factors .",
    "one is the pauli blocking of the outgoing nucleon , which in neutron - rich medium restricts emission of @xmath17 ( from a proton , creating a neutron in the final state ) more than the emission of @xmath15 ( since a proton appears in this case in the final state ) .",
    "the other effect is the dressing of the pion propagator , in which the particle - hole and delta - hole self - energies enter .",
    "since the dominant contribution comes from the particle - hole contribution for @xmath80 ( neutron density larger than the proton one ) the @xmath15 propagator is affected more than the one of the @xmath17 ( more details are given in the next section ) .",
    "while the delta has been shown to play an important role in the asymmetry for free nucleons , the medium effects are negligible @xcite and not included here , which is partially a consequence of the use of a soft pion - nucleon - delta form - factor , as obtained from a fit to pion - nucleon scattering @xcite . since the isobar s contribution for @xmath34 to @xmath81 is of the opposite sign compared to the contribution of eq .",
    "( [ pidis ] ) , as discussed in the next section , at small @xmath4 inclusion of this term might result in a small decrease of the calculated isospin - asymmetry effect .",
    "for numerical calculation we used the proton to neutron ratio of tungsten , for which there are measurements of the dy cross section @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry parameter in this case is @xmath82 and for the fermi momenta of protons and neutrons we chose @xmath83mev and @xmath84mev , corresponding to total nucleon density slightly below the saturation density . to take into account the different binding of protons and neutrons for the energy shifts we take @xmath85mev , @xmath86mev , with the common effective mass @xmath87gev , thus assuring the correct asymmetry energy of 28 mev . for the pion - nucleon - nucleon vertex we use a dipole form - factor with cut - off @xmath88gev .",
    "we checked that varying the cut - off in the range @xmath89 gev does not change appreciably the medium effect on the pion .    in fig .  1 we present the pion light - cone - momentum distributions for nucleons in medium and in free space ( upper four curves ) , as well as",
    "the excess pion distributions ( lower three curves ) .",
    "the @xmath17 ( @xmath15 ) distributions are per proton ( neutron ) , while that of @xmath16 is per average nucleon in the medium .",
    "the neutral pions see little difference between an isospin - symmetric and an isospin - asymmetric nuclear medium , as long as the total nucleon density is the same ( actually , the different mean - field shifts for proton and neutron may lead to a very small effect ) .",
    "however , for the case of neutron excess , the @xmath15 distribution per neutron is larger than the @xmath17 distribution per proton .",
    "this comes from a difference in particle - hole self energies , which is mainly responsible for the light - cone - momentum distributions .",
    "it is easy to understand the difference if we look at the imaginary part of the self energy as a function of pion s energy .",
    "if the energy is positive , the pion can excite a neutron from the fermi sea to become a proton ( above the proton fermi sea ) if its charge is positive .",
    "a negative pion can make from a proton in the fermi sea a neutron above the neutron fermi sea .",
    "since there are more neutrons than protons in the fermi sea , the absolute value of the imaginary part of the @xmath17 self energy will be larger than that of @xmath15 .",
    "bearing in mind that in expression ( [ pidis ] ) the pion energy is negative ( for the dominating part of the integraton region ) and using the relation that @xmath90 we arrive at the inequality @xmath91 , in accordance with the numerical computation .",
    "we mention that for the delta - hole self - energies the relationship between the @xmath15 and @xmath17 is the opposite to that of particle - hole one , i.e.  for positive energy that of @xmath15 is larger ( in absolute value ) than the self - energy of @xmath17 ; a consequence of different isospin factors in the pion - nucleon - delta vertex .",
    "we see that for the studied asymmetry there is a significant difference in the distributions of three charge states .",
    "the distribution in isospin symmetric medium is very close to the @xmath16 distribution .",
    "the valence distribution of negative pions contains up antiquarks and thus in neutron - rich matter they outnumber the down antiquarks present in the positive pions , due to nuclear effects on the pion clouds .",
    "a comparison of this effect to the recently measured @xcite @xmath92 difference for proton is presented in fig .",
    "2 . it shows the quantity @xmath37 compared to the mentioned @xmath93 , to which it is added in the expression ( [ dyratio2 ] ) for the dy ratio @xmath39 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 does not change appreciably with @xmath38 up to its value of 0.2 , but it is sensitive to the @xmath11 parameters . existing experimental and theoretical information @xcite suggests values of 0.55  0.7 for @xmath94 and 0.3  0.4 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "these values give results consistent with observed dy scattering for the isospin - symmetric calculation @xcite , and we use these values also in the present case . taking momentum",
    "dependent @xmath11 parameters ( as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) could change the details of our results .",
    "exploration of this and other effects we leave for a future publication .    the free nucleon parton distributions are taken from ref .",
    "they fit the @xmath35 and @xmath97 of ref .",
    "@xcite quite well up to @xmath98 .",
    "however , at larger @xmath4 the measured difference @xmath99 and especially the ratio @xmath97 are poorly fitted @xcite . to correct for this discrepancy , which would cause a significant increase in calculated @xmath39",
    ", we impose a constraint @xmath100 for @xmath101 ( by using the arithmetic mean value ) and interpolate linearly between @xmath98 , when the unmodified distributions are used , and the point @xmath102 . in this way",
    ", the employed distributions fit the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite very well . from fig .  2 we see that the two terms , whose sum appears in the square bracket of eq .",
    "( [ dyratio2 ] ) , are of comparable magnitude , i.e.  the nuclear effect of the isovector part of the dy ratio plays as important role as the nucleon antiquark asymmetry .    since the squared charge of up antiquarks is four times that of down antiquarks , the former enter in the dy cross section with correspondingly larger weight .",
    "this implies an enhancement of the dy cross - section ratio for neutron - rich medium compared to the isospin symmetric case . in fig .  3 the ratio of cross - sections ( per nucleon )",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath103 , where both in the numerator and denominator integration over @xmath104 is performed for @xmath105 , corresponding to the experimental situation of ref .",
    "the full line ( dash - dot line ) corresponds to @xmath82 and @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) , dotted line is for @xmath108 , while the dashed line is for asymmetric medium ( @xmath82 ) , but without medium effect on the pion cloud .",
    "measurements from ref .",
    "@xcite for w are shown as points with error bars .",
    "the errors are too large for any definite statement to be made on the isospin - asymmetry effect .",
    "we mention that the difference for larger @xmath103 values between the @xmath108 case of fig .  3 in the present work and fig .  8 of ref .",
    "@xcite is a consequence of the use of a more realistic dipole pion - nucleon - nucleon form - factor in the present calculation , and to a smaller extent due to a different set of parton distributions @xcite .",
    "we remark that the small pion excess probability found in the present work would also lead to a pion contribution to the emc ratio for @xmath109 which is smaller than in some other approaches @xcite . however , this ratio is mostly sensitive to the nucleon self - energy in the medium and the role of pions is difficult to isolate .",
    "we conclude : i ) a simultaneous experiment on a neutron - rich nucleus and an @xmath110 nucleus with a 5% accuracy should in principle be able to isolate the see up - down asymmetry ( term proportional to @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ dyratio2 ] ) ) ; ii ) about 50% of the @xmath111 difference in a nucleus comes from nuclear effects .",
    "therefore the assumption that nuclear effects are negligible as in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be justified .",
