    "in wireless communication networks , security is an important issue since signals are broadcasted in the air .",
    "physical layer security has drawn considerable attention since wyner @xcite proposed the wiretap channel in 1975 .",
    "@xcite provided a theoretic security analysis using information theory .",
    "consider a wiretap channel and a typical scenario in which alice , the source node , wants to have a private conversation with bob .",
    "the problem is that eve can also get the broadcasted signal . by deploying some cooperative relays between alice and bob",
    "could help alice to keep the signal secret .",
    "there are mainly three relaying methods : decode - and - forward , amplify - and - forward and cooperative jamming ( cj ) .",
    "cooperative jamming is a method that relays transmit noise to degrade the channels of eavesdropper . in cj , while the purpose of transmitting noise is to confound the eavesdropper , the noise unavoidably affects the legitimate receiver . in @xcite , a weighted common noise",
    "is transmitted by each relay in a way to ensure nulling at the destination , and suboptimal but closed form weights and relay power allocation were provided to maximize the secrecy rate subject to power constraints . as an improvement to @xcite",
    ", @xcite proposed optimal weight design and power allocation that do not rely on nulling at the destination .",
    "the aforementioned methods require global channel information at the relays , including that of the eavesdroppers . on the other hand , @xcite , @xcite proposed transmitting structured noise rather than weighted random noise . in @xcite ,",
    "all nodes have multiple antennas , and the jamming could be coordinated ( requiring public information ) , or uncoordinated ( ucj ) ( no public information ) . in ucj ,",
    "the helpers minimize the interference to bob autonomously by sending the jamming signals along the right singular vector that correspond to the smallest singular value of their channel to bob .",
    "again , no eavesdropper channel information is needed .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a scenario in which alice , bob and eve are all equipped with a single antenna , while each relay is equipped with two antennas .",
    "we study two artificial noise schemes , the local nulling artificial noise and the general structured artificial noise . in local nulling",
    ", each helper completely cancels its interference at bob , using only local information of its link to bob .",
    "the condition for achieving a local nulling is that the artificial noise at each helper can be designed to lie in the null space of its channel to bob , which requires that the relay has at least two antennas .",
    "taking cost , size limitation into consideration , we proceed with two antennas and but the result can be directly extended for any number of antennas at relays .",
    "the optimal structure for the jamming noise that maximizes the secrecy rate is also derived .",
    "we point out that local nulling is a special case of ucj @xcite . in @xcite , the ucj for mimo channel",
    "is studied , each helper s interference to bob is not necessarily cancelled locally ; this depends on the degrees of freedom of each helper s channel matrix .",
    "for example , if each helper has two antennas and bob has two antennas , then each helper s channel matrix @xmath0 has a size of @xmath1 . for this case",
    ", there is not an artificial noise @xmath2 such that @xmath3 .",
    "however , local nulling is the case in which each helper s interference to bob is always cancelled locally .    in the following ,",
    "we provide the system configuration in section [ sec : system model ] .",
    "the nulling noise scenario is described in section [ subsec : orthogonal artificial noise ] , and optimally structured noise scenario in discussed in section [ subsec : general structured artificial noise ] . in section [ sec : simulations ] we show that the nulling solution performs very close to the optimal solution in terms of secrecy rate . finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] provides some concluding remarks .",

    "we consider a wireless network model consisting of a source node ( alice ) , @xmath20 trusted relays , a destination node ( bob ) and a eavesdropper node ( eve ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ systemmodel ] .",
    "bob and eve can only passively receive signals from source and relays , but not transmit signals .",
    "alice , bob , eve , have antenna each and operates in half - duplex mode .",
    "each relay has two antennas .",
    "we denote the channels between @xmath21th relay and bob , and @xmath21th relay and eve as @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( both @xmath24 ) , respectively .",
    "the channels alice - bob , and alice - eve are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the source transmits a symbol @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the individual power budget of relay @xmath21 is @xmath29 .",
    "a cooperative jamming scenario is considered , i.e. , while alice is transmitting , the relays transmit independent noise signals , which are independent of the source message . in particular , relay @xmath21 transmits a @xmath24 noise vector @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 . in the following ,",
    "we address two different scenarios for the transmitted noise , i.e. , the nulling noise and the optimally structured noise . for the nulling noise case , the relay @xmath21 only requires knowledge of its own link ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) and determines the noise locally . for the optimally",
    "structured noise , global information of all the links is required .      in this section ,",
    "we design noise to lie in the null space of the channel , so that it will jam eve but cause no interference to bob .",
    "a simple solution to this problem can be obtained .    in this scheme ,",
    "only local information is required .",
    "interestingly enough , analysis and numerical simulation show that , the nulling solution achieves a good approximation of the optimal solution in average sense .    for a noise vector @xmath35 , associated with node @xmath21 , to cause nulling at bob , it must hold @xmath36 let @xmath37 be an orthonormal basis for the null space of @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we can express @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a zero mean gaussian random random variable with unit covariance , @xmath43 is the weight to be determined .",
    "the power of the noise is @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , this corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "using the fact @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the received signal at bob and eve is @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the awgn received at bob and eve . for simplicity , assume @xmath53=n_0 $ ] and @xmath54=n_0 $ ] .",
    "the secrecy rate of the above system can be expressed as @xmath55 obviously , to maximize @xmath56 , it should hold that @xmath57 , @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the noise @xmath40 is given by @xmath58 and the secrecy rate equals @xmath59 where @xmath60    _ discussion_- the relays do not need information on the eavesdropper channel .",
    "further , relay @xmath21 requires only the knowledge of its own link , i.e. , @xmath34 and hence locally determines its weight . as a result , such system can be implemented in a distributed fashion , which greatly facilitates a real world implementation .",
    "the above described nulling scheme is not optimal in terms of secrecy rate .",
    "one would not know how much secrecy rate is lost with the nulling scheme unless one compares that solution to the optimal one . in this section",
    "we derive the optimal solution for the jamming noise .",
    "this solution will require global channel information available at each relay .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the added cost of the global channel information does not buy significant secrecy rate improvement , thus suggesting that the nulling solution might be preferable in a real world implementation",
    ".    the received signal at bob and eve will be : @xmath61 the secrecy rate is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 s are defined in ( [ gamma_0 ] ) and ( [ gamma_i ] ) . if @xmath65 , it is exactly the orthogonal artificial noise case in ( [ orthogonal ] ) .",

    "_ discussion : _",
    "@xmath79 corresponds to the nulling solution with a secrecy rate @xmath80 .",
    "intuitively , it can be seen from @xmath81 in ( [ rsz - max ] ) that @xmath70 should not be large , since the main term @xmath82 in @xmath81 is @xmath83 of @xmath84 in @xmath56 . to see this clearly , according to ( [ eq : r1pi ] ) , @xmath56 does not exceed @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 .",
    "solving the following equation for @xmath70 @xmath87 we get @xmath88 .",
    "thus , @xmath89 we can seen that if @xmath90 is near @xmath91 , @xmath92 will be bounded by a small value compared with @xmath91 . according to ( [ eq : r1pi ] )",

    "we consider a gaussian wiretap channel where there are @xmath94 relays , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "for this case , @xmath26 is much stronger than @xmath25 , i.e. , the eavesdropper channel direct link is much stronger than the legitimate channel direct link ; the artificial noise help to achieve positive secrecy rate .",

    "the optimal @xmath70 is @xmath106 with the objective value @xmath107 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath108 , i.e. , the nulling solution is near optimal",
    ". then we vary @xmath63 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "[ fig3 ] plots @xmath56 and @xmath111 for different values of snr .",

    "in this paper , we propose a optimal structured gaussian noise to do cooperative jamming , which results the maximal secrecy rate . this provides a benchmark for nulling solution ,",
    "so we compared with local nulling with two antennas per helper and show that for certain snr range , the optimal noise performs almost the same as the nulling noise .",
    "this is particularly encouraging , as the nulling noise is very simple to obtain in a distributed manner and without eavesdropper channel knowledge , as opposed to the general noise that requires centralized processing .",
