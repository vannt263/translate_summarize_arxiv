    "study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons at the turn - on of the large hadron collider provides a high - statistics probe of the atlas @xcite detector , in terms of characterizing tracking , lepton identification , lepton and missing energy scale and resolution , and trigger performance . theoretically , measurements at the new energy of @xmath8 probe the proton at low-@xmath9 , constraining parton density functions . the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross - sections are known at nnlo , giving a test of perturbative calculations . also , these channels are important backgrounds for beyond sm processes .",
    "the data for these analyses come from the first lhc runs at @xmath8 , between march and july 2010 .",
    "the datasets for the @xmath10 and @xmath6 boson analyses are approximately @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , the luminosity being to known to @xmath13 .",
    "the analyses operate upon events from a collision bunch and both detector and machine status are used to select run periods for analysis .",
    "the data are compared to pythia @xcite samples processed with the atlas detector simulation software based on geant4 @xcite and fully reconstructed .",
    "the trigger for the muon analysis uses hit patterns in dedicated chambers(@xmath14 ) .",
    "the trigger efficiency is estimated at @xmath15 ( fully dominated by detector acceptance ) using orthogonal jet - based triggers .",
    "the electron data are triggered in calorimetric towers that identify @xmath16 activity in a window of @xmath17 .",
    "a threshold of five trigger counts ( @xmath18 ) is used .",
    "the efficiency of this trigger is better than @xmath19 , with negligible uncertainty .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath21 analyses require a reconstructed vertex ( @xmath22 three tracks ) consistent with the beam spot .",
    "in addition , to reject cosmic rays and beam halo events , the muon analyses require that the primary vertex be found within @xmath23 of the nominal position .",
    "electron measurements come from the energy of calorimeter clusters found in using a sliding - window approach . for electron identification ,",
    "calorimetric shower shapes , hadronic leakage , track - cluster matching and impact parameter criteria are used . for the @xmath10 analysis ,",
    "purity is enhanced by requiring @xmath24 compatibility between track and cluster , high - threshold transition radiation hits , and criteria to reject conversions .",
    "the analysis uses electrons with @xmath25 in the region @xmath26 .",
    "the barrel - endcap transition region @xmath27 is excluded .",
    "muon reconstruction combines tracking information in the inner detector ( i d ) the muon spectrometer ( ms ) .",
    "decays in flight are rejected with minimum @xmath28 requirements on the ms track , and by imposing @xmath28 compatibility between i d and ms track reconstructions .",
    "the cosmic ray contamination is reduced by requiring that the muon come from within 1 cm of a reconstructed vertex .",
    "muons with @xmath25 are used , with @xmath14 . to reduce qcd background ,",
    "the summed @xmath29 of tracks in a cone ( @xmath30 ) around the muon must be @xmath31 of muon @xmath29 .",
    "missing @xmath32 is found using em - scale calorimeter energy deposited in topological clusters , corrected for hadronic response , dead material and out - of - cluster losses . for muons ,",
    "this is supplemented with the momentum , the muon s calorimeter deposition not being added to the calorimeter term .",
    "a requirement of @xmath33 is imposed for the @xmath0 analysis .",
    "the @xmath10 analysis requires that the transverse mass @xmath34 of the candidate @xmath35 - @xmath36 system , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtw ] , be @xmath37 .",
    "there are @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) candidates .",
    "electroweak ( ew ) backgrounds for @xmath10 are obtained from monte carlo predictions . in the electron channel ,",
    "the ew background is @xmath42 , coming chiefly from leptonic @xmath43 .",
    "the muon channel background of @xmath44 , is dominated by @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "the qcd background in @xmath46 comes from hadrons misidentification , as well as electrons from conversion and heavy quark decay .",
    "it is estimated with a binned likelihood fit to data of monte carlo templates of calorimetric isolation , at @xmath47 events .",
    "the muon channel qcd background , mainly from heavy quark decay , is estimated by extrapolating from control regions in the @xmath48 vs. isolation plane , at @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath6 boson candidates are formed using pairs of oppositely charged leptons , with the invariant mass of the lepton pair required to be between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "46 ( 79 ) candidates are observed in the @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) channel , whose peak is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mll ] .",
    "the background for @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "the background in the muon channel is @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 observed events and background estimate of @xmath58 in a luminosity of @xmath59 , we have : @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is the geometrical acceptance at generator level , while @xmath62 is the ratio between the number of selected reconstructed events and the number of generated events in the fiducial region .",
    "the systematics on @xmath63 and @xmath64 are estimated at @xmath65 , from using different pdf sets and comparing mc@nlo and pythia values .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath62 in the electron channel is @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , driven by the lepton identification .",
    "the muon systematic comes from the trigger , muon reconstruction and resolution , and from missing energy for the @xmath0 .",
