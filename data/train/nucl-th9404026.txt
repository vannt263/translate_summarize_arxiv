    "@xmath0body scattering theory is by now well understood . we have a good insight into its basic structural features , and understand the relations between the various formulations of the multiparticle collision problem both in the wave  function and in the transition  operator language @xcite .",
    "some important hints have also been gained about how to tackle the formidable computational problems implied by few ",
    "body scattering theory , at least in the four  body case @xcite . among the many formulations of @xmath0body scattering theory , the approach developed by sandhas and co  workers @xcite plays a privileged role . indeed , the alt  grassberger  sandhas ( ags ) formulation of scattering theory , while being fully equivalent to the celebrated yakubovski  @xcite approach @xcite , is at the same time susceptible of a much clearer physical interpretation thanks to the employment of a powerful matrix notation .",
    "the above situation has to be contrasted with what happens for the @xmath4multinucleon problem . in such a case",
    ", the possibility of production or absorption of the meson greatly complicates the theory , since the presence of production / absorption processes prevents one from using standard few  body connected  kernel methods , which essentially represent a clever resummation of non  relativistic multiple  scattering diagrams ( with a _ fixed _ , finite  number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "when dealing with @xmath4multinucleon systems , one is faced with two kinds of problems .",
    "first , one has to deal with the basic , conceptual questions arising when the underlying meson  baryon field ",
    "theory is truncated to a limited number of particles ( in practice one resorts to a truncation to a finite number of pions , since nucleon ",
    "antinucleon states are usually neglected ) .",
    "second , one is left with the non  trivial question of how to get connected ",
    "kernel equations coupling all the relevant transition amplitudes . for the @xmath4nn",
    " nn case , this problem has been solved by several authors following different routes ( for a thorough discussion of @xmath4nn systems and the relevant literature see ref .",
    "whatever the approach may be , in any case , at the end one is left with equations having more or less the same structure , providing a connected  kernel scheme coupling scattering , production and absorption amplitudes in a unified way .",
    "the situation is far less satisfactory for the proper @xmath4multinucleon problem . to the best of our knowledge , for the @xmath4nnn",
    " nnn case the only attempt to a unitary , connected  kernel theory has been given by avishai and mizutani @xcite several years ago .",
    "these authors resorted to the ags approach in the quasi ",
    "particle approximation to get connected ",
    "kernel equations in the pure four  body ( @xmath4nnn ) sector . the disconnected contributions due to the coupling of the four  body space to the three ",
    "nucleon one were then handled through a two  potential formulation .",
    "this procedure , although solving in principle the scattering problem , does not give a closed set of coupled equations , and is too involved to be considered for practical applications .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath4multinucleon problem with a completely new approach .",
    "the key ingredient of the present formalism is a proper generalization of the ags matrix method to situations in which elementary production or absorption @xmath4nn vertices connect spaces with a different number of particles ( the n  body space made by the @xmath4 and @xmath0 - 1 nucleons , and the ( @xmath0 - 1)nucleon space ) .",
    "the result is that the subsystem dynamics are naturally embedded into the full pion  multinucleon problem , even when production / absorption processes occur in the various subsystems .",
    "this paper illustrates in full details the approach we have developed in order to treat the pion ",
    "multinucleon problem .",
    "it represents a complete article discussing extensively the theory we have already outlined in a recent letter @xcite for the pion  trinucleon problem . with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , however , this paper discusses the equations in the more general framework of the pion ",
    "multinucleon problem , rather than being limited to the specific pion  trinucleon system .    for a clear understanding of the theory , we consider indispensable to revisit first the well  known results of the standard @xmath0body theory . our revisitation has the advantage to maintain intelligible at every step the connection between the physical amplitudes and the gs ( chain  labelled ) @xmath0body operators . in fact , our revisitation starts from one single amplitude , which describes the fully unclusterized @xmath1 process , and bootstraps from there the whole @xmath0body connected  kernel  equation theory .",
    "it seems to us that this connection is more hardly achieved in previous formulations .",
    "moreover , and what is most important , the simplicity of this formulation allows to repeat in the second part of the paper a rather similar procedure for the more complicated pion+(@xmath0 - 1)nucleon problem , where pion absorption / production processes have to be taken into account .    in sect .",
    "ii , we consider the standard few  body problem .",
    "our procedure can be summarized as follows .",
    "first we start from the @xmath1 transition amplitude describing @xmath0 incoming and outgoing particles , and introduce the ags transition operators referring to @xmath6cluster@xmath7cluster transitions _ via _ a suitable ansatz .",
    "dynamical equations can be easily derived for these operators starting from the lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation for the @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "then one introduces operators labelled by chains of partitions starting at the @xmath8cluster level by iterating the above procedure through the ags matrix method .",
    "the new ( chain  labelled ) operators can be related to the physical transition amplitudes with @xmath9 clusters in the asymptotic states .",
    "this procedure can be repeated , until @xmath10cluster@xmath11cluster transitions are considered .",
    "these are associated to operators labelled by complete chains , satisfying the well  known ags @xmath0body equations , having a connected yakubovski  kernel .    in sect .",
    "iii , we start from the non  connected afnan ",
    "blankleider ( ab ) equations coupling all the fully unclusterized transition amplitudes one can have in correspondence to one pion and @xmath0 - 1 nucleons @xcite .",
    "these equations can be derived starting from meson  nucleon field theory by means of taylor s diagrammatic method @xcite , once diagrams with at most one pion are retained , and explicit multipion intermediate states are disregarded .",
    "then , we introduce new chain  of  partition labelled operators by exploiting the same ansatz technique already tested in the standard @xmath0body theory , and , from the ab equations , we derive new dynamical equations for these operators .",
    "it has to be observed that the extension of the ags approach to processes allowing for production / absorption is in itself not trivial .",
    "this is most clearly seen in the chain  labelling of the operators , which has to be modified so as to deal simultaneously with spaces having a different number of particles .",
    "( for example , in the @xmath4nnn  nnn case , one gets 24 coupled equations , in place of the 18 equations of the standard yakubovski  type formalism . ) for the general pion ",
    "multinucleon problem , our findings are not exhaustive , in that the formalism does not complete the program for obtaining connected  kernel equations , much in the same way the yakubovski4body equations are in fact connected only for @xmath0=4 , while for @xmath12 they can be used as a starting point to move one step forward to the next stage of the theory , which is connected for @xmath0=5 , and so on .",
    "we conjecture that the same hierarchic scheme could be attempted in order to achieve a fully connected  kernel formulation of the general pion ",
    "multinucleon problem , however this is beyond the limits of the present paper . finally , in the second part of sect .",
    "iii , we analyze in detail the kernel of the equation we have obtained , and show for the first time that such a kernel is indeed connected for the pion  trinucleon system .",
    "as we will show , the connectedness properties of the coupled pion  trinucleon equations are rather different from the standard yakubovski  four  body equation .",
    "whereas the standard four  body equations are connected after two iterations , the presence of the meson ",
    "baryon vertex modifies substantially the connectedness properties of the kernel , in that it is achieved at different stages for different sectors of the kernel : the @xmath13 sector turns out to be connected after one iteration , the @xmath14 after two , while the remaining @xmath15 and @xmath16 sectors require three iterations .",
    "let s consider a system of @xmath0 particles interacting through two  body potentials . if we consider the extreme scattering situation of @xmath0 clusters going to @xmath0 clusters , where obviously each cluster has to be made by one single particle , the amplitude @xmath17 ( @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 for brevity ) for the process @xmath0",
    "@xmath20 @xmath0 satisfies a @xmath0body lippmann ",

    "body potentials pertaining to each pair @xmath24 @xmath25 if @xmath26 , there is only one pair , and the solution of the lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation uniquely determines the physical amplitude .    if n @xmath27 , the solution of the lippmann  schwinger equation is not uniquely determined , and therefore this equation is not sufficient to find the physical amplitude .",
    "on the contrary , we can determine unambiguously the amplitude @xmath28 _ internal _ to a certain partition @xmath24 in @xmath29 clusters @xmath30 this is the two  body amplitude for the pair @xmath24 , embedded in a bath of @xmath9 spectators .    to determine the physical amplitude it is fundamental to rewrite @xmath17 it in terms of new unknowns @xmath31 using the following ansatz : @xmath32 the sums in eq .",
    "( [ fundamental ] ) range over all the possible @xmath33 pairs one can consider out of n particles .",
    "therefore we have introduced a new set of @xmath34 quantities @xmath31 . to get the new equation for the unknown @xmath31 we substitute eq .",
    "( [ fundamental ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) and consider eq .",
    "( [ 2bodyls ] ) , thereby obtaining @xmath35 with @xmath36 defined as @xmath37 .",
    "this equation will hold _ a fortiori _ if the unknowns @xmath31 satisfy a similar term  by ",
    "term expression @xmath38 simple algebraic manipulations allow one to rewrite this expression in the very famous form of alt  grassberger  sandhas ( ags ) @xcite @xmath39 if n @xmath40 , the solution of the ags equations is uniquely determined , and hence the knowledge of the quantities @xmath31 is sufficient to determine the physical amplitude @xmath17 through eq .",
    "( [ fundamental ] ) .",
    "if n @xmath41 the program has not been concluded yet , since the ags equations are not sufficient to determine unambiguously the quantities @xmath31 .",
    "however , we can follow sandhas brilliant reinterpretation of the ags equation and consider it as a _ super _ lippmann  schwinger equation for matrices defined in the space of pairs @xmath42 with the definitions @xmath43 since we formally returned to a lippmann  schwinger equation ( but , as will be explained below , this _ new _ ls equation gives the physical amplitudes for @xmath6 @xmath20 @xmath6 clusters ) , we can repeat the same procedure outlined above for the @xmath17 amplitude .",
    "first , we introduce a new  potential \" internal to a given ( @xmath9)cluster partition @xmath44 , namely a matrix operator @xmath45 @xmath18 @xmath46 , whose elements , labelled by ( @xmath29)cluster  partitions , are defined only when the partitions @xmath24 and @xmath47 can be obtained from @xmath44 by breaking one of its clusters ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "then the sum rule @xmath50 is straightforwardly proved once it has been observed that two different pairs unambiguously identify one single partition @xmath44 in @xmath9 clusters @xcite .",
    "second , we consider the amplitude for an @xmath29 to @xmath29 process internal to the partition @xmath44 in @xmath9 clusters ( @xmath44 can be either a 3-body cluster embedded in a bath of @xmath51 spectators , or a couple of two distinct pairs embedded in a bath of @xmath52 spectators ) , which is fully determined by the equation @xmath53 the notion of partition in @xmath29 clusters _ internal _ to a given partition in @xmath9 clusters naturally brings us to the introduction of chain of partitions .",
    "that is , out of all the @xmath33 partitions in @xmath29 clusters , only those coming from a sequential break  up of one particular partition @xmath54 of the @xmath55 partitions in @xmath9 clusters are significant in eq .",
    "( [ n-2superls ] ) .",
    "more generally , one can introduce chains of partitions @xmath56 , _ i. e. _ sets of partitions into @xmath57 clusters , where the partition into @xmath58 clusters @xmath59 is obtained by the coalescence of two clusters of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .    finally , to get to the next equation ( which is exhaustive if n=4 ) we again rewrite the matrix @xmath62 in terms of a set of new unknown matrices @xmath63 using the ansatz : @xmath64 where the sums range over all the possible partitions in @xmath9 clusters of an @xmath0body system .",
    "the number of such unknown matrices is the square of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , we can view the set of new unknown matrices @xmath63 as one _ single _ matrix defined in the chain space spanned by elements uniquely identified by one partition in @xmath9 clusters and one partition in @xmath29 clusters _ internal _ to the given partition in @xmath9 clusters .",

    "( [ ls ] ) , ( [ pairpot ] ) , and ( [ 2bodyls ] ) , the difference being that eq .",

    "( [ superls ] ) starting from eqs .",

    "similarly , with the expression ( [ fundamental-1 ] ) it is now possible to reach to the next stage of the hierarchy and derive the 4body yakubovski  equations in the form of grassberger  sandhas .",
    "the procedure to follow is the trivial replication of the one outlined previously for the ags equation . instead of doing this",
    ", we will rather exploit the recursive structure of this @xmath0body theory and obtain the general result which holds at _ any _ level of the hierarchy .",
    "suppose we have iterated ( @xmath66 - 1 ) times the procedure outlined above , thereby obtaining a ( @xmath66 - 1)_times super _ ls matrix equation @xmath67 where the matrix elements of @xmath68 are labelled by chains of partitions @xmath69 and @xmath70 and refer to physical transition amplitudes between @xmath71 clusters ( see below ) .",

    "the two spaces are spanned by the chain indices @xmath209 [ @xmath48 ] , and @xmath211 [ @xmath212 , respectively . the hybrid nature of the second chain is obvious , since @xmath44 is a @xmath8cluster partition in the @xmath0body sector , and @xmath175 is another @xmath8cluster partition in the @xmath6nucleon sector .    at this level of the hierarchy ,  green s functions \" ,  potentials \" , and `` t matrices '' are defined as @xmath213    it must be clearly understood that _ when @xmath44 and @xmath214 are of type iii or iv all the hybrid ",
