    "cosmological models in lower dimensions have been under analysis in several works  @xcite .",
    "these theories offer interesting mathematical results that , if properly taken into account , can also be used in realistic models .",
    "these cosmological formulations are obtained starting with different 2d gravitational models@xcite . as a first example",
    ", we can take the gravity model proposed by teitelboim and jackiw  @xcite ( jt model ) ; a theory that provided consistent results at classical and quantum levels  @xcite .",
    "this model works as the `` closest counterpart '' of general relativity in the 2d case ; the obvious candidate , einsteinian gravity , furnishes no physics in 2d  @xcite . as another alternative",
    ", one can consider the cghs model  @xcite ; here we have an additional degree of freedom , the dilaton , giving the model the status of 2d analogue of the brans - dicke theory @xcite . here",
    "the cosmological results include , as in the jt case , the description of a matter / radiation filled universe  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of description of inflation or dark energy regimes depends basically on special conditions ( such as negative energy densities ) or on the use of the van der waals equation , modeling the inflaton - matter substratum@xcite .",
    "another investigations using these models considered the inclusion of quantum effects@xcite ; based on the remarkable fact that in 2d gravity is a renormalizable theory@xcite .",
    "the one - loop corrections ( integrating over scalar fields ) were calculated@xcite , and the final effective action encapsulates those effects permitting semi - classical 2d cosmological regimes@xcite . in an analogous manner it is possible to consider fermions as sources ; the dirac field equations are constructed using the tetrad formalism @xcite in combination with the general covariance principle . in this work ,",
    "we want to analyze the positive - accelerated solutions of cghs - inspired , 2d cosmologies with quantum corrections ( without including a cosmological constant ) ; these can be associated to the description of an inflationary period followed by the beginning of a ( bosonic , fermionic ) matter dominated period , with a compatible behavior of the physical quantities ( scale factor and energy densities ) .",
    "we also obtain an accelerated regime when quantum corrections are considered .",
    "in fact , the behavior of the acceleration function depends strongly on the initial conditions of the dilaton field , independently of the presence of the quantum corrections .",
    "another important point verified here is that it is possible to obtain naturally a transition to a decelerated ( matter dominated ) period when _ fermions _ are included as sources .",
    "the manuscript is structured as follows : in section ii we make a brief review of the dilatonic 2d model with their cosmological applications . in section iii ,",
    "the young 2d universe is described by taking into account the quantum corrections of the field theory , when we have bosons as sources . in the last section fermions",
    "are included , playing the role of matter constituents ; this is followed by our conclusions .",
    "units have been chosen so that @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we make a short review of 2d gravity in a cosmological context focusing on the cghs model mentioned in the introduction ; for further details on 2d gravity and cosmology the authors refer to results presented in @xcite .",
    "2d gravity has the remarkable feature that when the einstein field equations are invoked to rule the 2d space - time physics no dynamics emerges  @xcite .",
    "several theories were proposed as alternatives , based on gauge principle grounds ; among them the jackiw - teitelboim ( jt ) model and the callan - giddings - harvey - strominger model ( cghs)@xcite . the cghs model was proposed initially for the investigation of 2d black - holes  @xcite .",
    "the action in these models include a dilaton field , which plays a role that is similar to the one present in the 4d jordan - brans - dicke model@xcite .",
    "the corresponding action was inspired in string theories  @xcite , and the equations of motion that emerge are    g_= e^-2= -8 t _ , r -- 4()^2 + 4 ^2 = 0 , where @xmath1 is the dilaton , @xmath2 is a cosmological constant and @xmath3 is the energy - momentum tensor of the sources .",
    "the robertson - walker metric has a simple form in a 2d riemannian space - time @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cosmic scale factor , that encloses the properties of the 2d gravitational field .",
    "in fact , the usual geometrical quantities ( ricci tensor and curvature scalar ) turn out to be for this metric : @xmath6 the regimes coming out include dust and radiation filled 2d universes @xcite .",
    "the existence of positive accelerated solutions depend , when barotropic equations of state are used , on the imposition of unusual conditions like negative energy @xcite .",
    "however , interesting results appear when the van der waals ( vdw ) equation is considered @xcite ; in fact a transition from an inflationary to a matter dominated 2d universe can be obtained in this case , as far as the wdw equation approaches the behavior of a barotropic expression as a consequence of the accelerated expansion@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the time evolution of the cosmic scale factor and of its acceleration can show , in some cases , a dramatically different behavior when compared to the one obtained in the jt model ( in its gauge fixed formulation ) @xcite , as a consequence of the dilaton field behavior in this model @xcite . in all cases , after the inflaton - matter field transition occurs , the accelerated regime never returns@xcite .",
    "a fundamental point here is that these results arise from classical formulations , and including only bosonic sources@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider quantum effects in these models , given the fundamental point that in 2d gravity is renormalizable@xcite . in the following sections we consider a model inspired in the cghs model , including bosonic and fermionic sources with quantum effects , investigating the regimes that emerge from the 2d cosmology dynamics .",
    "here we analyze the behaviour of a 2d cosmological theory where the gravitational sources are bosons , also investigating the influence of quantum effects in this cghs based model ( we dont include the bulk cosmological constant present in the original theory@xcite ) . the functional integration over one of the sources ( the scalar field @xmath7 , that will play the role of the inflaton ) furnishes the one - loop corrected action , that contains the usual conformal - anomaly term plus local contributions that are included to maintain the simple form of the conserved currents @xcite .",
