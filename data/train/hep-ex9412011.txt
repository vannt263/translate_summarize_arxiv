    "recently , several experimental collaborations at pep / petra@xcite , tristan@xcite , and lep@xcite have reported that high - transverse momentum(@xmath15 ) jet production in ( quasi-)real @xmath0 collisions requires a new mechanism ( resolved - photon process ) in addition to the direct photon process @xmath16(fig.[fig1]-(a ) ) .",
    "the resolved - photon processes are such mechanisms in which the quark - gluon contents of photons participate in hard scattering to cause the high-@xmath15 jet production[6 - 8 ] .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in figs . [ fig1]-(b ) and ( c ) for one- and two - resolved - photon processes , respectively .",
    "the analyses of @xmath0 collisions at tristan@xcite and @xmath17 collisions at hera@xcite have provided clear results for the production of remnant jets which are regarded as the evidence of the resolved - photon processes .",
    "these recent data on jet production have provided us with some important information concerning the quark and gluon contents of a photon : they are inconsistent with a model which has very hard gluon distribution ( lac3@xcite ) . in the jet analysis@xcite",
    ", however , the sensitivity of the data was limited to high @xmath18 values @xmath19 because of the experimental @xmath20 cut applied in jet reconstruction and a theoretical cut ( @xmath21 ) introduced in order to justify the perturbative calculation .",
    "charm - quark production in @xmath0 collisions is a good tool for studying the jet production mechanisms in two - photon processes@xcite .",
    "the reaction has several advantages over light - quark production .",
    "since the charm - quark mass is ( relatively ) well defined , the free parameter @xmath21 is unnecessary .",
    "the dominant mechanisms for @xmath22 production are only the direct and the one - resolved processes(photon - gluon fusion ) ; the contribution from the two - resolved process is small .",
    "charmed - hadron production from the vector - meson - dominance model(vdm : fig.[fig1]-(d))@xcite is also expected to be negligible in the tristan energy region . it should also be emphasized that higher order qcd corrections ( o(@xmath23 ) ) are available for both the direct and one - resolved processes@xcite .",
    "studies of charm production in @xmath24 collisions thus provide a good opportunity to probe the gluon density in the photon .",
    "in this paper we report on a measurement of open charm production in @xmath0 collisions under an anti(no)-tag condition . in the pep / petra experiments@xcite and in our previous paper@xcite ,",
    "charm quarks were identified by detecting @xmath25 signals . in this paper , we use electrons and positrons in the final states to tag charm - quark production in two - photon processes ( hereafter , electron also implies positron ) .",
    "the inclusive electron method is sensitive to the charm - quark production at relatively low @xmath20 , where the one - resolved process contributes significantly .",
    "we can access the small bjorken-@xmath18 region down to @xmath26 , where model dependence is the largest among various parametrizations of the gluon density in the photon[10,16 - 20 ] . the same kind of inclusive electron analysis was carried out by the venus collaboration@xcite .      in order to compare the data with theoretical predictions of the direct and the resolved processes",
    ", we carried out a monte - calro simulation for each process .",
    "the cross section for charm - quark pair production in the two - photon process @xmath27 was obtained by applying the equivalent real - photon approximation(epa ) to the nearly on - shell virtual photons emitted by the beam electrons@xcite . under the anti - tag condition imposed on the scattered electrons",
    ", the photon flux factor can be written as@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the kinematical minimum of the photon virtuality .",
    "@xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the maximum photon virtuality determined by the experimental anti - tag condition .",
    "for the scale @xmath34 , we set @xmath35@xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the scattering angles of the beam electrons were limited to less than @xmath36 if their energies were greater than 0.4 @xmath37(i.e .",
    "@xmath38 = @xmath36 for @xmath39 ) .",
    "@xmath31 was mainly determined by this experimental anti - tag condition . to check the validity of the approximation ,",
    "the epa prediction was compared with the exact matrix element calculation@xcite for the direct @xmath40 process .",
    "we found that both predictions agree at a 1% level under this anti - tag condition@xcite .    for the parton distribution inside the photon ,",
    "we have tried two typical parametrizations given by drees - grassie(dg)@xcite and by levy - abramowicz - charchula(lac1)@xcite as working examples .",
    "the gluon distribution of lac1 increases more rapidly than that of dg at @xmath18 less than 0.1 .    for the cross sections of the subprocesses ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) we used the lowest order formulas including the charm - quark mass .",
    "the higher order effects were taken into account by appropriately weighting the @xmath15 distribution of charm quarks@xcite .",
    "we used the bases / spring program@xcite to calculate the cross sections of these processes and to generate events at the parton level .",
    "the charm - quark mass(@xmath45 ) used in the cross - section calculations was changed in the range 1.3 - 1.5 gev in order to see the effect of the mass .",
    "the threshold was set at @xmath46 gev for the mass of the @xmath0 system and at 2 @xmath47 1.6 gev for that of the @xmath22 system .",
    "the remnant jets in the resolved process were generated in the beam direction .",
    "the produced partons were hadronized by jetset 6.3@xcite . in this program , the ( constituent ) charm - quark mass(@xmath48 )",
    "was set to be 1.6 gev . to ensure energy conservation , we adjusted the momentum of the charm quark in the fragmentation stage as @xmath49 . for the fragmentation of the charm quark",
    ", we used the peterson function , and set the parameter @xmath50 to be 0.07 .",
    "the generated events were passed through the topaz detector simulator so as to take into account any acceptance and resolution effects .",
    "the data were taken with the topaz detector at the tristan @xmath1 collider .",
    "the integrated luminosity was 95.3 pb@xmath2 and the average center - of - mass energy was 58.0 gev .",
    "the details of the topaz detector are described in references@xcite . in this analysis",
    ", we used a time - projection chamber ( tpc ) for tracking and de / dx measurements for charged tracks .",
    "plastic scintillation counters(tof ) surrounding the tpc were used for time - of - flight measurements .",
    "we detected electromagnetic showers with three kinds of calorimeters : a barrel lead - glass calorimeter ( bcl ) , an end - cap pb - proportional - wire - counter - sandwich calorimeter ( ecl ) , and a forward bismuth - germanate - crystal calorimeter ( fcl ) , which cover polar angular ranges @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "since the fcl is very close to the beam pipe , the calorimeter is protected from beam - induced background by an extensive shielding system@xcite .",
    "two - photon events were detected mainly by the charged - track trigger .",
    "the trigger required at least two charged tracks with @xmath20 @xmath55 0.3 - 0.7 gev and an opening angle @xmath55 45 - 70 degrees ( depending on the beam condition ) . on the other hand , the neutral energy trigger required that the energy deposit in the bcl had to be greater than 2 @xmath56 4 gev , or that in the ecl had to be greater than 10 gev . the details concerning the trigger system",
    "can be found in reference@xcite .",
    "the trigger efficiency for charmed events in two - photon processes was estimated with a trigger simulation to be about 93% .",
    "the hadronic events produced by two - photon interactions were selected based on the following criteria :    1 .",
    "the number of charged tracks with @xmath57 gev and the polar angle @xmath58 had to be at least 4 ; 2 .",
    "the position of the origin of the event(i.e .",
    "the event vertex ) , reconstructed from all tracks , had to be within 1.5 cm in the xy - plane and within @xmath59 2.0 cm along the beam line from the interaction point ; 3 .",
    "the visible energy(@xmath60 ) of the event had to satisfy @xmath61 gev , where both the charged tracks in the tpc and the neutral clusters in the bcl were used in the calculation of @xmath60 ; 4 .",
    "the mass of the system of the observed hadrons(@xmath62 ) had to be @xmath63 gev , where the tracks in the tpc and the clusters in the bcl were used ; and 5 .",
    "the energy of the most energetic cluster appearing in the bcl , the ecl , or the fcl had to be less than @xmath64 .    criterion 5 ensures the anti - tag condition , which limits the scattering angles of the beam electrons to less than @xmath36 .",
    "we call these events an anti - tag sample .",
    "substantial part of which had some activities , though of relatively low energy , in the fcl .",
    "our monte - calro study showed that these activities can be naturally understood by remnant jets in the resolved - photon processes@xcite . in order to more closely study these events ,",
    "we selected them by adding the following criterion : the energy deposit in the fcl had to be in the range 0.5 gev @xmath65 ; they are called remnant - jet - tagged events .",
    "these selection cuts left 27379 anti - tag and 13508 remnant - jet - tag events .      among the selected events ,",
    "electron - track candidates were searched in the momentum range @xmath66 gev and the polar angle rage @xmath67 .",
    "the topaz detector allows three methods for electron identification .",
    "the energy loss ( de / dx ) information from the tpc enables us to separate electrons from hadrons in the momentum region(@xmath68gev)@xcite .",
    "the e / p ratio of the energy(e ) measured by the bcl and the momentum(p ) measured by the tpc can separate electrons clearly .",
    "the tof was useful to resolve electrons from kaons and protons in the overlapped region of de / dx .",
    "since the largest background source in this analysis was the electrons from the @xmath69-conversions at the material in front of the tpc , we first rejected the dominant part of such electrons by the following methods .",
    "we reconstructed secondary vertices ( @xmath70 s ) from all combinations of two tracks , and calculated the invariant mass of each @xmath70 assuming that its daughter particles are electrons .",
    "for the @xmath70-reconstruction , two kinds of vertices , i.e. , non - crossing and crossing cases in the xy - plane ( perpendicular to the beam axis ) were searched . in the former case ,",
    "the distances of the two tracks at the minimum distance position in the xy - plane were required to be less than 7 cm in the xy - plane and 3 cm in the z - direction . in the latter case , we chose from the two crossing points that with the shorter z - difference , and required it to be less than 1.5 cm .",
    "we then rejected the tracks in the pair if its invariant mass was @xmath71 80 mev in the former or @xmath71 150 mev in the latter cases .",
    "we also required the closest approach of each electron - track candidate to the event vertex in the xy - plane to be @xmath72 0.5 - 1.5 cm depending on @xmath15 .    among the remaining tracks ,",
    "electron tracks were searched by combining the information from the e / p ratio , de / dx , and tof as follows : ( 1 ) charged tracks in the tpc were extrapolated to the bcl .",
    "we then selected , for each tpc track , the bcl cluster which was the closest .",
    "the e / p of each of the so - selected tpc - bcl combinations had to satisfy @xmath73 e / p @xmath74 .",
    "( 2 ) the de / dx was calculated for the electron - track candidate to be used in the subsequent electron counting . the resultant de / dx was mostly contained in the range @xmath75 kev / cm .",
    "( 3 ) to remove kaons and protons in the de / dx overlap region , we used information from the tof and required the track to have a confidence level(cl ) of 0.01 or better for the electron hypothesis .    the performance of electron identification is demonstrated in fig.[fig : selection ] , where various distributions ( the closest tpc - bcl distance(fig.[fig : selection]-(a ) ) , the e / p ratio(fig.[fig : selection]-(b ) ) , the cl for the electron hypothesis in the tof(fig.[fig : selection]-(c ) ) , and the de / dx(fig.[fig : selection]-(d ) ) ) are shown .",
    "notice that these figures were obtained with the electron candidates selected by all of the cuts but the one on each plotted quantity .",
    "notice in particular that figs.[fig : selection]-(a ) to ( c ) were made with an de / dx cut ( @xmath75 kev / cm ) which was used only for purpose of displaying . as can be seen from the de / dx distribution in fig.[fig : selection]-(d )",
    ", two peaks corresponding to electrons and pions are clearly separated .",
    "we counted the numbers of electrons in each @xmath15 bin by fitting the de / dx distributions with double gaussians bin by bin .",

    "the errors are statistical . the numbers of electron candidates summed over the @xmath15 bins were @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the anti - tag and the remnant - jet - tag samples , respectively .",
    "these electron candidates included background tracks coming from sources other than charm - quark decays .",
    "these background sources were studied in detail",
    ".    there remained electrons coming from @xmath69-conversions which escaped from pair reconstruction .",

    "the failure rate , @xmath78 , was estimated for each @xmath20-bin and was typically @xmath560.4 . in the calculation , we included contributions from dalitz decay(@xmath79 ) as well as the conversion electron pairs . in order to estimate the number of remaining background tracks from @xmath69-conversions , we multiplied the number of the reconstructed conversion pairs in the experiment by @xmath80 in each @xmath20 bin and obtained the cross - hatched histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] .",

    "the contamination was only 3.0% .",
    "the change of the cut on the charged multiplicity in the event selection from 4 to 5 made only 1.6% difference seen in the electron yield .",

    "the beam - gas background was checked by using off - vertex events .",
    "the electron yield in these events was consistent with zero .",
