    "fter rediscovery of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes in the late 1990 s @xcite , a great deal of research effort has been expended in design and construction of these codes . among designing all branches of ldpc codes , quasi cyclic ( qc ) codes",
    "have been allocated much more efforts of the researchers .",
    "indeed , due to their capacity - achieving and also their intrinsic property of practically implementable decoding algorithm , qc - ldpc codes have been adopted as the standard codes for various next generations of communication systems @xcite .",
    "applications of these codes to storage systems , such as flash memories , have now been seriously investigated @xcite .    of famous methods in constructing qc - ldpc codes",
    "are , _ graph - theoretic _ and _ protograph - based _",
    "methods @xcite , as well as , _ combinatoric - based _ and _ algebraic _ methods @xcite .",
    "recently , designing short to moderate length qc - ldpc codes based on circulant permutation matrices ( cpm s ) have found much attraction among the researchers@xcite . in almost all of these cited works ,",
    "they attempt to find shortest possible length of cpm - qc - ldpc codes , given an specific _ girth _ and degree distribution .",
    "short to moderate length codes may not approach very closely to the _ shannon limits _",
    ", however , one advantage of designing such codes is lowering the encoding and decoding complexity and so latency .",
    "another area in investigating qc - ldpc codes is finding their _ minimum distances_@xcite .",
    "minimum distance plays a direct and significant role in _ bit - error - rate _ ( ber ) performances of the codes .",
    "simulation results exhibit high minimum distance of a code affects its performance even under sub - optimal _ belief propagation _ ( bp ) decoding algorithms .",
    "in fact , given a fixed length , degree distribution and girth of a qc - ldpc code , the higher minimum distance of the code the lower ber curve of the code is .",
    "for single - edge protograph codes it has established that the minimum hamming distance is always upper bounded by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in addition , smarandache _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that for a multiple - edge cpm - qc - ldpc code of maximum column weight @xmath2 , the maximum reachable minimum distance could be even superior to @xmath1 .",
    "however , looking at numerical results reported for minimum distances of single - edge protograph codes in @xcite , as well as , considering our new experimental results for multiple - edge protograph codes , it seems that , as long as we try to find the shortest possible length of a cpm - qc - ldpc code ( given a fixed girth and degree distribution ) , its minimum distance tends to be decreased .    in this work we put our concentration on investigating other features of cpm - qc - ldpc codes of short to moderate lengths that may improve ber of the codes and thus compensating the lack of low minimum distance of such codes . roughly speaking",
    ", we observed that if multiplicities of short simple cycles in tanner graph of a code are high enough ( approximately higher than the average possible ones , given a fixed length , degree distribution and minimum distance ) , then , ber curve of the code will be much lower than another code with similar parameters but with considerable smaller number of simple cycles .    to construct short length cpm - qc - ldpc codes with high number of short simple cycles , we took benefits of _ perfect difference families _ ( pdf s ) and _ quasi perfect difference families _",
    "( qpdf s ) .",
    "we regenerate one previously known of this type of the codes with girth 6 , as well as , we introduce a new flexible design of such codes with girth at least 6 . due to the existence of high number of _ inevitable _ short cycles in tanner graph of our constructed codes , we are able to extend the length of our primary constructed code with short length to the moderate length one by increasing @xmath3 , where , @xmath3 is the _ lifting degree _ of our primary code .",
    "the inevitable short simple cycles will not vanish by increasing @xmath3 , instead , their multiplicities will linearly increase by enlarging @xmath3 .",
    "although minimum distances of our codes are small , due to the high number of their simple cycles , ber performances of these codes outperform their counterparts in the literature . table [ tab3 ] has summarized the details of many of compared codes which are decoded in an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel under _ sum - product _ ( sp ) algorithm .",
    "high number of short cycles in tanner graph of ldpc codes may cause _ error floor _ phenomenon in ber curve of the codes .",
    "thanks to our flexible design of cpm - qc - ldpc codes ( called construction 2 ) that use pdf s as their shift - values of cpm s , we show that starting from a primary qc code and without decreasing its girth and minimum distance , it is possible to design a range of qc codes , where , their number of simple cycles could be gradually increased .",
    "our software simulations reveal that with a subtly design of the base matrix of the codes , and simultaneously , by gradually augmentation of their short cycles , it is possible to reach a target ber ( down to @xmath4 for short to moderate length codes ) without observing error floor and these codes still outperform almost all of their counterpart codes in waterfall region .",
    "figures of some of the simulated codes are added in section [ ener ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] presents a primary definition of difference families , theorems to show their existence , definition to cpm based qc - ldpc codes and a general formula for calculating expected values of simple cycles in tanner graph of a regular code . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we first represent one previously known construction of cpm - qc - ldpc codes using pdf s by name construction 1 . in the following and using construction 1 , we introduce a flexible method for constructing a cpm - qc - ldpc code name construction 2 . section [ ener ] contains all of the experimental results such as examples , tables , figures , and our justification in advantages of using pdf s in designing short length qc - ldpc codes .",
