    "since the discovery of quantum mechanics , quantum entanglement has played an important role in quantum information processing ( qip ) , such as superdense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite and quantum algorithms @xcite . in recent years , there has been a growing interest in entanglement dynamics by using the coherent manipulation in solid state systems .",
    "one of the most natural candidates is spin chain , which can be simulated by means of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite or by coupled microcavities @xcite , and has been extensively studied in numerous works @xcite .",
    "especially much attention has been paid to the relation between entanglement and quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) which are driven purely by quantum fluctuation occurring at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the qpt is related to a dramatic change in the ground - state properties of the system as an external non - temperature parameter varies across the transition point .",
    "consequently , the dramatic change in the structure of the ground state should result in a great difference between the quantum correlation on both sides of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "naturally , the entanglement should be able to characterize the change .",
    "for example , osterloh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has proven that the derivative of the nearest - neighbor entanglement diverges at qcp . due to the dynamical ultrasensitivity of the induced quantum critical system @xcite , quantum entanglement can be treated as a tool @xcite to characterize qpts .",
    "it s worth noting that the systems considered are closed , i.e. , isolated systems have no interaction with their external environment . however , real physical systems are never isolated , since the coupling between system and the surrounding environment is inevitable .",
    "the quantum dynamics of physical systems is always complicated by their coupling to many environmental modes .",
    "the dominant environmental effects are localized modes at low temperature , which are usually described by spin - bath model .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is that the coupling process between system and bath shows a duality of influence on quantum system . on one hand",
    ", the coupling can assist people to achieve some tasks in qip @xcite .",
    "one of the focuses is the induced entanglement between the two noninteracting qubits .",
    "for instance ,",
    "@xcite showed that the entanglement changed dramatically along the line of critical points of spin bath .",
    "subsequently , an enhanced effect of induced entanglement near the critical point was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "these investigations exhibit a new perspective to engineer protocols for entanglement generation . on the other hand ,",
    "the coupling between system and bath can play a role as decoherence .",
    "it can transfer a pure ensemble of qubits to a mixture of classical ones @xcite and lead to asymptotical disappearance of system entanglement . in some cases ,",
    "the entanglement will vanish even in finite time @xcite .",
    "great efforts have been devoted to the study of the decoherence caused by the spin bath @xcite .",
    "one of the most common models is anisotropic xy model , which encompasses two well - known spin models , i.e. , ising chain and the xx ( isotropic xy ) chain in a transverse field .",
    "the xy model holds an advantage that it can be exactly solved by mapping to a spinless fermionic model .",
    "such solvability provides a playground for testing the physical ideas @xcite . for one - qubit case , quan _",
    "@xcite first proved that the decay of the loschmidt echo ( le ) was enhanced by the qpt of the ising bath . with that , this consideration was extended to the two - qubit case . in the transverse ising model , sun _",
    "@xcite showed that the concurrence decayed exponentially with fourth power of time in the vicinity of the critical point of spin bath .",
    "for an xy spin chain with dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction , cheng _",
    "_ @xcite found that decay of decoherence factor was sensitive to the dm interaction , especially in the strong - coupling region .",
    "also , the three - qubit case was studied by some works @xcite .",
    "the previous works have extensively studied the decoherence process of initially entangled state of noninteracting qubits @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the influence of the xy spin bath with dm interaction term for two interacting qubits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian describing two - qubit system coupled to an xy spin chain with dm interaction , and derive an analytic formula for the exact solution of entanglement . in sec .",
    "entanglementdynamics , regarding the spin bath as a decoherent environment , we exhibit the competition between system - bath and interqubit interaction in the entanglement dynamics .",
    "we analyze the competing effects of environmental noise and two - qubit interaction for various system parameters , especially at the qcp of spin bath .",
    "we observe resonance peaks emerging for some specific parameters .",
    "finally , we give a summary of our results in sec .",
    "the quantum system we consider consists of two interacting qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 coupled to a spin environment @xmath2 .",
    "the environment is composed by @xmath3 spin-1/2 particles with periodic boundary condition , which can be described by one - dimensional xy spin chain with dm interaction @xcite . the schematic diagram of the quantum open system is shown in fig .",

    "now we investigate the influence of the spin bath during the process of entanglement generation . in fig .",

    "especially , the quantum phase transition of xy model at @xmath97 will greatly enhance the decoherence , which coincides with the rapid decay of le in an ising model @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we consider dynamics evolution of the system based on a finite - sized environment . to examine the effect of the chain length @xmath3 on the quantum entanglement evolution , we plot fig .",
    "[ fig : c - n ] .",
    "it shows that the longer the spin chain , the more serious the attenuation at qcp .",

    "[ fig : c - n ] shows that the maximum concurrence decays exponentially with the square root of chain length @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , in weak - coupling region , for large @xmath94 , the concurrence restores the sine function versus time .",

    "the growth of entanglement can be interpreted via the fact that the dm interaction arouses the strong planar quantum fluctuations .",
    "we would like to point out that the entanglement generation is suppressed at the qcp of spin bath as in fig .",
    "[ weakcoupling - sys - env ] , so the maximum concurrence can not reach unity .",
    "however , as the anisotropy parameter @xmath105 decreases , the quantum fluctuations arising from the in - planar interactions become stronger @xcite , and then the two qubits in the presence of quantum fluctuations are more quantum correlated . in a word , the suppression of the entanglement at the qcp can be compensated both by increasing the dm interaction and by decreasing the anisotropy of the spin chain .",
    "we now turn to the entanglement dynamics beyond the weak - coupling region .",
    "[ g ] shows the concurrence as a function of time and the coupling @xmath18 .",
    "when the coupling @xmath18 increases , due to the decoherence of spin environment , the concurrence damps dramatically .",
    "thus in the strong - coupling region , no entanglement is generated .",
