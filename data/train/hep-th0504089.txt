    "the physical and mathematical motivations for studying complex space - times or real riemannian four - manifolds in gravitational physics are first described .",

    "examples are given such as complex projective space @xmath1 , non - singular sub - manifolds of @xmath1 , and orientable surfaces .",

    "although lorentzian geometry is the mathematical framework of classical general relativity and can be seen as a good model of the world we live in ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the theoretical - physics community has developed instead many models based on a complex space - time picture .",
    "we postpone until sec .",
    "3.3 the discussion of real , complexified or complex manifolds , and we here limit ourselves to say that the main motivations for studying these ideas are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) when one tries to make sense of quantum field theory in flat space - time , one finds it very convenient to study the wick - rotated version of green functions , since this leads to well defined mathematical calculations and elliptic boundary - value problems . at the end",
    ", quantities of physical interest are evaluated by analytic continuation back to _",
    "real _ time in minkowski space - time .",
    "\\(2 ) the singularity at @xmath3 of the lorentzian schwarzschild solution disappears on the real riemannian section of the corresponding complexified space - time , since @xmath3 no longer belongs to this manifold ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence there are real riemannian four - manifolds which are singularity - free , and it remains to be seen whether they are the most fundamental in modern theoretical physics .",
    "\\(3 ) gravitational instantons shed some light on possible boundary conditions relevant for path - integral quantum gravity and quantum cosmology ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "\\(4 ) unprimed and primed spin - spaces are not ( anti-)isomorphic if lorentzian space - time is replaced by a complex or real riemannian manifold .",
    "thus , for example , the maxwell field strength is represented by two independent symmetric spinor fields , and the weyl curvature is also represented by two independent symmetric spinor fields ( see ( 2.1.35 ) and ( 2.1.36 ) ) . since",
    "such spinor fields are no longer related by complex conjugation ( i.e. the ( anti-)isomorphism between the two spin - spaces ) , one of them may vanish without the other one having to vanish as well .",
    "this property gives rise to the so - called self - dual or anti - self - dual gauge fields , as well as to self - dual or anti - self - dual space - times ( sec .",
    "\\(5 ) the geometric study of this special class of space - time models has made substantial progress by using twistor - theory techniques . the underlying idea ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is that conformally invariant concepts such as null lines and null surfaces are the basic building blocks of the world we live in , whereas space - time points should only appear as a derived concept . by using complex - manifold theory ,",
    "twistor theory provides an appropriate mathematical description of this key idea .",
    "a possible mathematical motivation for twistors can be described as follows ( papers 99 and 100 in @xcite ) . in two real dimensions ,",
    "many interesting problems are best tackled by using complex - variable methods .",
    "in four real dimensions , however , the introduction of two complex coordinates is not , by itself , sufficient , since no preferred choice exists . in other words ,",
    "if we define the complex variables @xmath4 @xmath5 we rely too much on this particular coordinate system , and a permutation of the four real coordinates @xmath6 would lead to new complex variables not well related to the first choice .",
    "one is thus led to introduce three complex variables @xmath7 : the first variable @xmath8 tells us which complex structure to use , and the next two are the complex coordinates themselves . in geometric language , we start with the complex projective three - space @xmath9 ( see sec .",
    "1.2 ) with complex homogeneous coordinates @xmath10 , and we remove the complex projective line given by @xmath11 . any line in @xmath12 is thus given by a pair of equations @xmath13 @xmath14 in particular , we are interested in those lines for which @xmath15 . the determinant @xmath16 of ( 1.1.3 ) and ( 1.1.4 ) is thus given by @xmath17 which implies that the line given above never intersects the line @xmath18 , with the obvious exception of the case when they coincide .",
    "moreover , no two lines intersect , and they fill out the whole of @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to the fibration @xmath19 by assigning to each point of @xmath12 the four coordinates @xmath20 .",
    "restriction of this fibration to a plane of the form @xmath21 yields an isomorphism @xmath22 , which depends on the ratio @xmath23 .",
    "this is why the picture embodies the idea of introducing complex coordinates .",
    "such a fibration depends on the conformal structure of @xmath24 .",
    "hence , it can be extended to the one - point compactification @xmath25 of @xmath24 , so that we get a fibration @xmath26 where the line @xmath11 , previously excluded , sits over the point at @xmath27 of @xmath28 .",
    "this fibration is naturally obtained if we use the quaternions @xmath29 to identify @xmath30 with @xmath31 and the four - sphere @xmath25 with @xmath32 , the quaternion projective line .",
    "we should now recall that the quaternions @xmath29 are obtained from the vector space @xmath33 of real numbers by adjoining three symbols @xmath34 such that @xmath35 @xmath36 thus , a general _ quaternion _",
    "@xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , whereas the conjugate quaternion @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 note that conjugation obeys the identities @xmath42 @xmath43 if a quaternion does not vanish , it has a unique inverse given by @xmath44 interestingly , if we identify @xmath45 with @xmath46 , we may view the complex numbers @xmath47 as contained in @xmath29 taking @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , every quaternion @xmath49 as in ( 1.1.9 ) has a unique decomposition @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , by virtue of ( 1.1.8 ) .",
    "this property enables one to identify @xmath29 with @xmath53 , and finally @xmath31 with @xmath30 , as we said following ( 1.1.6 ) .",
    "the map @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 preserves the fibration because @xmath56 , and induces the antipodal map on each fibre",
    ". we can now lift problems from @xmath25 or @xmath24 to @xmath9 and try to use complex methods .",
    "following @xcite , we now describe some basic ideas and properties of complex - manifold theory .",
    "the reader should thus find it easier ( or , at least , less difficult ) to understand the holomorphic ideas used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we know that a manifold is a space which is locally similar to euclidean space in that it can be covered by coordinate patches .",
    "more precisely ( @xcite ) , we say that a _ real _",
    "@xmath58-dimensional manifold @xmath59 is a set @xmath59 together with a @xmath57 atlas @xmath60 , i.e. a collection of charts @xmath61 , where the @xmath62 are subsets of @xmath59 and the @xmath63 are one - to - one maps of the corresponding @xmath62 into open sets in @xmath64 such that    \\(i ) @xmath59 is covered by the @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath65    \\(ii ) if @xmath66 is non - empty , the map @xmath67 is a @xmath57 map of an open subset of @xmath64 into an open subset of @xmath64 . in general relativity , it is of considerable importance to require that the hausdorff separation axiom should hold .",
    "this states that if @xmath68 are any two distinct points in @xmath59 , there exist disjoint open sets @xmath69 in @xmath59 such that @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "the space - time manifold @xmath72 is therefore taken to be a connected , four - dimensional , hausdorff @xmath73 manifold @xmath74 with a lorentz metric @xmath75 on @xmath74 , i.e. the assignment of a symmetric , non - degenerate bilinear form @xmath76 with diagonal form @xmath77 to each tangent space .",
    "moreover , a time orientation is given by a globally defined , timelike vector field @xmath78 .",
    "this enables one to say that a timelike or null tangent vector @xmath79 is future - directed if @xmath80 , or past - directed if @xmath81 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    by a complex manifold we mean a paracompact hausdorff space covered by neighbourhoods each homeomorphic to an open set in @xmath82 , such that where two neighbourhoods overlap , the local coordinates transform by a complex - analytic transformation .",
    "thus , if @xmath83 are local coordinates in one such neighbourhood , and if @xmath84 are local coordinates in another neighbourhood , where they are both defined one has @xmath85 , where each @xmath86 is a holomorphic function of the @xmath87 s , and the determinant @xmath88 does not vanish .",

    "the quotient manifold @xmath116 is the so - called hopf manifold , and is homeomorphic to @xmath117 .",
    "last but not least , we consider the group @xmath118 of all matrices @xmath119 and let @xmath120 be the discrete group consisting of those matrices for which @xmath121 are gaussian integers .",
    "this means that @xmath122 , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 are rational integers .",
    "an iwasawa manifold is then defined as the quotient space @xmath125 . 0.3 cm * e5 . *",
    "orientable surfaces are particular complex manifolds .",
    "the surfaces are taken to be @xmath73 , and we define on them a positive - definite riemannian metric . the korn ",
    "lichtenstein theorem ensures that local parameters @xmath126 exist such that the metric locally takes the form @xmath127 or @xmath128 if @xmath129 is another local coordinate , we have @xmath130 since @xmath75 is globally defined .",
    "hence @xmath131 is a multiple of @xmath132 or @xmath133 . in particular ,",
    "if the complex coordinates @xmath87 and @xmath129 define the same orientation , then @xmath131 is proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "thus , @xmath129 is a holomorphic function of @xmath87 , and the surface becomes a complex manifold .",
    "riemann surfaces are , by definition , one - dimensional complex manifolds .",
    "let us denote by @xmath134 an @xmath89-dimensional real vector space .",

    "applying @xmath138 to both sides of this equation , one finds @xmath142 .",

    ", @xmath148 is an @xmath58-complex - dimensional complex vector space .",
    "elements @xmath149 are of type @xmath150 if @xmath151 , and of type @xmath152 if @xmath153 , @xmath141 .",
    "if @xmath134 has a complex structure @xmath138 , an _ hermitian structure _ in @xmath134 is a complex - valued function @xmath29 acting on @xmath154 such that @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 by using the split of @xmath158 into its real and imaginary parts @xmath159 conditions ( 1.2.7 ) and ( 1.2.8 ) may be re - expressed as @xmath160 @xmath161    if @xmath59 is a @xmath73 manifold of dimension @xmath58 , and if @xmath162 and @xmath163 are tangent and cotangent spaces respectively at @xmath164 ,",

    "is called _ almost complex_.",
    "if a manifold is almost complex , it is even - dimensional and orientable .",
    "however , this is only a necessary condition .",
    "examples can be found ( e.g. the four - sphere @xmath25 ) of even - dimensional , orientable manifolds which can not be given an almost complex structure .      since this paper is devoted to the geometry of complex space - time in spinor form , sec .",
    "2 presents the basic ideas , methods and results of two - component spinor calculus .",
    "such a calculus is described in terms of spin - space formalism , i.e. a complex vector space endowed with a symplectic form and some fundamental isomorphisms .",
    "these mathematical properties enable one to raise and lower indices , define the conjugation of spinor fields in lorentzian or riemannian four - geometries , translate tensor fields into spinor fields ( or the other way around ) .",
    "the standard two - spinor form of the riemann curvature tensor is then obtained by relying on the ( more ) familiar tensor properties of the curvature .",
    "the introductory analysis ends with the petrov classification of space - times , expressed in terms of the weyl spinor of conformal gravity .    since the whole of twistor theory may be viewed as a holomorphic description of space - time geometry in a conformally invariant framework , sec .",
    "3 studies the key results of conformal gravity , i.e. @xmath47-spaces , einstein spaces and complex einstein spaces .",
    "hence a necessary and sufficient condition for a space - time to be conformal to a complex einstein space is obtained , following @xcite .",
    "such a condition involves the bach and eastwood  dighton spinors , and their occurrence is derived in detail . the difference between lorentzian space - times , riemannian four - spaces , complexified space - times and complex space - times is also analyzed .",
    "section 4 is a pedagogical introduction to twistor spaces , from the point of view of mathematical physics and relativity theory .",
    "this is obtained by defining twistors as @xmath0-planes in complexified compactified minkowski space - time , and as @xmath0-surfaces in curved space - time . in the former case , one deals with totally null two - surfaces , in that the complexified minkowski metric vanishes on any pair of null tangent vectors to the surface .",
    "hence such null tangent vectors have the form @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is varying and @xmath170 is covariantly constant .",
    "this definition can be generalized to complex or real riemannian four - manifolds , provided that the weyl curvature is anti - self - dual .",
    "an alternative definition of twistors in minkowski space - time is instead based on the vector space of solutions of a differential equation , which involves the symmetrized covariant derivative of an unprimed spinor field .",
    "interestingly , a deep correspondence exists between flat space - time and twistor space .",
    "hence complex space - time points correspond to spheres in the so - called projective twistor space , and this concept is carefully formulated .",
    "sheaf cohomology is then presented as the mathematical tool necessary to describe a conformally invariant isomorphism between the complex vector space of holomorphic solutions of the wave equation on the forward tube of flat space - time , and the complex vector space of complex - analytic functions of three variables .",
    "these are arbitrary , in that they are not subject to any differential equation .",
    "eventually , ward s one - to - one correspondence between complex space - times with non - vanishing cosmological constant , and _ sufficiently small _ deformations of flat projective twistor space , is presented .",
    "an example of explicit construction of anti - self - dual space - time is given in sec .",
    "5 , following @xcite .",
    "this generalization of penrose s non - linear graviton ( @xcite , @xcite ) combines two - spinor techniques and twistor theory in a way very instructive for beginning graduate students .",
    "however , it appears necessary to go beyond anti - self - dual space - times , since they are only a particular class of ( complex ) space - times , and they do not enable one to recover the full physical content of ( complex ) general relativity .",
    "this implies going beyond the original twistor theory , since the three - complex - dimensional space of @xmath0-surfaces only exists in anti - self - dual space - times . after a brief review of alternative ideas",
    ", attention is focused on the recent attempt by roger penrose to define twistors as _ charges _ for massless spin-@xmath2 fields .",
    "such an approach has been considered since a vanishing ricci tensor provides the consistency condition for the existence and propagation of massless helicity-@xmath2 fields in curved space - time . moreover , in minkowski space - time the space of charges for such fields is naturally identified with the corresponding twistor space .",
    "the resulting geometric scheme in the presence of curvature is as follows .",
    "first , define a twistor for ricci - flat space - time .",
    "second , characterize the resulting twistor space .",
    "third , reconstruct the original ricci - flat space - time from such a twistor space .",
    "one of the main technical difficulties of the program proposed by penrose is to obtain a _ global _ description of the space of potentials for massless spin-@xmath2 fields .",
    "the corresponding _ local _ theory is instead used , for other purposes , in @xcite .",

    "6 reviews the plebanski contributions to complex general relativity , i.e. heaven spaces and heavenly equations , while concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "spinor calculus is presented by relying on spin - space formalism . given the existence of unprimed and primed spin - space , one has the isomorphism between such vector spaces and their duals , realized by a symplectic form . moreover , for lorentzian metrics",
    ", complex conjugation is the ( anti-)isomorphism between unprimed and primed spin - space .",
    "finally , for any space - time point , its tangent space is isomorphic to the tensor product of unprimed and primed spin - spaces via the infeld  van der waerden symbols .",
    "hence the correspondence between tensor fields and spinor fields .",
    "euclidean conjugation in riemannian geometries is also discussed in detail .",
    "the maxwell field strength is written in this language , and many useful identities are given .",
    "the curvature spinors of general relativity are then constructed explicitly , and the petrov classification of space - times is obtained in terms of the weyl spinor for conformal gravity .      two - component spinor calculus is a powerful tool for studying classical field theories in four - dimensional space - time models . within this framework ,",
