    "the first - year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) observations are consistent with predictions of the concordance @xmath0cdm model with scale - invariant and adiabatic fluctuations which have been generated during the inflationary epoch @xcite .",
    "after the first year of _ wmap _ data , the si of the cmb anisotropy ( _ i.e. _ rotational invariance of n - point correlations ) has attracted considerable attention .",
    "tantalizing evidence of si breakdown ( albeit , in very different guises ) has mounted in the _ wmap _ first year sky maps , using a variety of different statistics .",
    "it was pointed out that the suppression of power in the quadrupole and octopole are aligned @xcite .",
    "further `` multipole - vector '' directions associated with these multipoles ( and some other low multipoles as well ) appear to be anomalously correlated @xcite .",
    "there are indications of asymmetry in the power spectrum at low multipoles in opposite hemispheres @xcite .",
    "possibly related , are the results of tests of gaussianity that show asymmetry in the amplitude of the measured genus amplitude ( at about @xmath1 to @xmath2 significance ) between the north and south galactic hemispheres @xcite .",
    "analysis of the distribution of extrema in _ wmap _ sky maps has indicated non - gaussianity , and to some extent , violation of si @xcite .",
    "however , what is missing is a common , well defined , mathematical language to quantify si ( as distinct from non gaussianity ) and the ability to ascribe statistical significance to the anomalies unambiguously .",
    "in order to extract more information from the rich source of information provided by present ( and future ) cmb maps , it is important to design as many independent statistical methods as possible to study deviations from standard statistics , such as statistical isotropy ( si ) . since si can be violated in many different ways",
    ", various statistical methods can come to different conclusions . because each method by design is more sensitive to a special kind of si violation .    as a statistical tool of searching for departures from si",
    ", we use the bipolar power spectrum ( bips ) which is sensitive to structures and patterns in the underlying total two - point correlation function @xcite .",
    "the bips is particularly sensitive to real space correlation patterns ( preferred directions , etc . ) on characteristic angular scales . in harmonic space , the bips at multipole @xmath3 sums power in off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , @xmath4 , in the same way that the ` angular momentum ' addition of states @xmath5 , @xmath6 have non - zero overlap with a state with angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "signatures , like @xmath8 and @xmath9 being correlated over a significant range @xmath10 are ideal targets for bips . these are typical of si violation due to cosmic topology and the predicted bips in these models have a strong spectral signature in the bipolar multipole @xmath3 space @xcite .",
    "the orientation independence of bips is an advantage since one can obtain constraints on cosmic topology that do not depend on the unknown specific orientation of the pattern ( _ e.g. _ , preferred directions ) .    in the rest of this section",
    "we briefly introduce some basic statistical properties of cmb and discuss the statistical isotropy as distinct from gaussianity . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we introduce bips in real as well as harmonic space . in section 4 and 5",
    "we define an unbiased estimator for bips and compute its cosmic variance in details . in section 6 we briefly introduce some possible sources of breakdown of si . in section 7",
    "we discuss the results of applying the method to the simulations and wmap data .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 8 . for completeness",

    "when @xmath61 is not diagonal , the angular power spectrum @xmath54 does not have all the information of the field and one should also take the off - diagonal elements into account .      statistical isotropy and gaussianity of cmb anisotropies",
    "are two independent and distinct concepts .",
    "the gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations is a key assumption of modern cosmology , motivated by simple models of inflation . and",
    "since the statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations are closely related to those of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropy , a measurement of non - gaussianity of the cmb will be a direct test of the inflation paradigm .",
    "if cmb anisotropy is gaussian , then the two point correlation fully specifies the statistical properties . in the case of non - gaussian fields , one must take the higher moments of the field into account in order to fully describe the whole field .",
    "statistical isotropy is a condition which guarantees that statistical properties of cmb sky ( e.g. @xmath14-point correlations ) are invariant under rotation .",
    "hence , in a si model , the iso - contours of two point correlations where one point is fixed and the other scans the whole sky , are concentric circles around the given point . any breakdown of statistical isotropy will make these iso - contours non - circular .",
    "in addition to cosmological mechanisms , instrumental and environmental effects in observations easily produce spurious breakdown of statistical isotropy .",
    "a gaussian field may or may not respect the statistical isotropy . in other words we can have    1 .   gaussian and si models : in these models two point correlation and @xmath54 have all the information of the field and @xmath62 2 .",
    "gaussian but not si models : two point correlation contains all the information of the field , but @xmath63 .",

    "non - gaussian but si models : two point correlation alone is not sufficient to describe the whole field and we need to take higher moments into account but every @xmath14-point correlation of the field is invariant under rotation .",
    "non - gaussian and non - si models : neither two point correlation has all the information nor it is invariant under rotation .    here we confine ourselves to gaussian fields where we only need to consider two point correlations . we will present a general way of describing fields of the kind ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the above list .",
    "two point correlation of cmb anisotropies , @xmath64 , is a two point function on @xmath65 , and hence can be expanded as [ bipolar ] c(_1 , _ 2 ) = _ l_1,l_2,l , m a_l_1l_2^m \\{y_l_1(_1 ) y_l_2(_2)}_m , where @xmath66 are coefficients of the expansion ( here after biposh coefficients ) and @xmath67 are the bipolar spherical harmonics which transform as a spherical harmonic with @xmath68 with respect to rotations @xcite given by \\{y_l_1(_1 ) y_l_2(_2)}_m =",
