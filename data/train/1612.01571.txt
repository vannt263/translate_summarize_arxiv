    "rna interference is a complex biological process that occurs in many eukaryotes and fulfils a regulatory role by allowing control over gene expression @xcite , while also providing an effective immune response against viruses and tranposons through its ability to target and destroy specific mrna molecules @xcite .",
    "this multi - step process is mediated by double - stranded rnas ( dsrna ) of different lengths that are generated by an inverted - repeat transgene , or an invading virus during its replication process @xcite .",
    "a very simple description of the core pathway is as follows .",
    "the presence of transgenic or viral dsrna triggers an immune response within the host cell , whereby the foreign rna is targeted by specialized enzymes called dicers ( dlc ) .",
    "these enzymes cleave the target rna into short 21 - 26 nucleotide long molecules , named short interfering rnas ( sirna ) or microrna ( mirna ) , which can subsequently be used to assemble a protein complex , called the rna - induced silencing complex ( risc ) .",
    "this specialized complex can recognise and degrade rnas containing complementary sequences into garbage rna that can no longer be translated into a functioning protein , thus leading to the translational arrest of the viral or transgenic rna @xcite . while the core pathway might be sufficient to describe rna interference in mammals , for other organisms",
    "it is possible that the process is not strictly limited to the molar concentration of sirna at the initiating site , but can spread systemically @xcite .    in the studies of rna interference in the nematode _ caenorhabditis elegans _",
    ", it was observed that a notable portion of the produced sirna was not derived directly from the initializing dsrna , suggesting a presence of a mechanism in which some additional dsrna could be generated @xcite . to account for this discovery , primed and unprimed amplification pathways were proposed ,",
    "in which an rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) or rna replicase could synthesize the additional unaccounted dsrna @xcite . in the case of primed amplification",
    ", it is postulated that when assisted by rdrp , the sirna which binds on mrna can itself initialise dsrna synthesis , thus generating a new round of dsrnas ready to be used in the process . on the other hand ,",
    "unprimed amplification describes the situation where dsrna synthesis occurs without the assistance of the primer rdrp , but instead relies on the presence of garbage rna to facilitate synthesis . as in most complex biological processes",
    ", rnai carries risks and is prone to different errors , as it necessitates the host s ability to correctly discriminate between endogenous and exogenous mrna @xcite .",
    "thus , any invading viral sequences with cross - reactive similarities or accidental production of anti - sense transcripts corresponding to self genes can result in a self - reactive response that can be extremely damaging to the host . to limit the self - damage caused by the feed - forward amplification in rnai ,",
    "a protection mechanism has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "a number of mathematical models have considered different aspects of rnai in its roles of immune guard against viral infections , as well as an attractive tool for targeted gene silencing that is important for gene therapies .",
    "one of the earliest models was developed and analysed by bergstrom et al .",
    "these authors focused on the issue of avoiding self - directed gene silencing during rnai and hypothesised that this can be achieved via _ unidirectional amplification _",
    ", whereby silencing only persists in the presence of a continuing input of dsrna , thus acting as a safeguard against a sustained self - damaging reaction , or , in the case of viral infection , ending the process once the infection is cleared .",
    "this model was extended by groenenboom et al .",
    "@xcite , who analysed primed and unprimed amplification pathways to account for the dsrna dosage - dependence of rnai and to correctly describe the nature of transient and sustained silencing .",
    "groenenboom and hogeweg @xcite and rodrigo et al .",
    "@xcite have analysed how viral replication is affected by its interactions with rnai for plus - stranded rna viruses , with particular account for different viral strategies for evading host immune response .    similarly to natural or artificial control systems , biological systems also possess intrinsic delays that arise from the lags in the sensory process of response - initiating variables , the transportation of components that regulate biological interactions , after - effect phenomena in inner dynamics and metabolic functions , including the times necessary for synthesis , maturation and reproduction of cells and whole organisms @xcite .",
    "these delays can often lead to changes in stability and play a significant role in modelling control systems that typically involve a feedback loop . on the other hand , mathematical models without time delays are based on the assumption that the transmission of signals and biological processes occur instantaneously . although the timescale associated with these delays can sometimes be ignored , for instance , when the characteristic timescales of the model are very large compared to the observed delays , there are clear cases where the present and future state of a system depend on its past history . in such situations , dynamics of the system can only be accurately described with delay differential equations rather than the traditional ordinary differential equations . due to the non - instantaneous nature of the complex processes involved in rna interference ,",
    "it is biologically feasible to explicitly include time delays associated with the times required for transport of rnai components , and assembly of different complexes .",
    "nikolov and petrov @xcite and nikolov et al .",
    "@xcite have considered the effects of such time delays within a single amplification pathway as modelled by bergstrom et al . @xcite . under a restrictive and somewhat unrealistic assumption that the natural degradation of risc - mrna complex takes place at exactly the same speed as formation of new dsrna ,",
    "the authors have shown how time delays can induce instability of the model steady state , thus disrupting gene silencing and causing oscillations .    in the context of sirna - based treatment , bartlett and davis @xcite",
    "have performed a detailed analysis of the process of sirna delivery and its interaction with the rnai machinery in mammalian cells , and compared it to experimental results in mural cell cultures .",
    "this model and associated experiments have provided significant insights into optimising the dosage and scheduling of the therapeutic sirna - mediated gene silencing .",
    "raab and stephanopoulos @xcite also considered sirna dynamics in mammalian cells with an emphasis on two - gene systems with different kinetics for the two genes .",
    "arciero et al .",
    "@xcite studied a model of sirna - based tumour treatment which targets the expression of tgf-@xmath0 , thus reducing tumour growth and enhancing immune response against tumour cells .",
    "since originally rna interference was discovered in plants @xcite , which present a very convenient framework for experimental studies of rnai , a number of mathematical models have considered specific aspects of the dynamics of viral growth and its interactions with rnai in plants .",
    "groenenboom and hogeweg @xcite have analysed a detailed model for the dynamics of intra- and inter - cellular rna silencing and viral growth in plants .",
    "this spatial model has demonstrated different kinds of infection patterns that can occur on plant leaves during viral infections .",
    "more recently , neofytou et al .",
    "@xcite have analysed the effects of time delays associated with the growth of new plant tissue and with the propagation of the gene silencing signal .",
    "they have shown that a faster propagating silencing signal can help the plant recover faster , but by itself is not sufficient for clearance of infection .",
    "on the other hand , a slower silencing signal can lead to sustained periodic oscillations around a chronic infection state . in a very important practical context of viral co - infection ,",
    "neofytou et al .",
    "@xcite have studied how the dynamics of two viruses simultaneously infecting a single host is mediated by the rnai .    in this paper",
    "we consider a model of rnai with primed amplification , and focus on the role of two time delays associated with the production of dsrna directly from mrna , or from aberrant rna .",
    "an important result obtained in this study is partial destruction of the hysteresis loop : while the original model without time delays is bi - stable , under the influence of time delays , the steady state with either the smallest or the highest concentration of mrna can lose its stability via a hopf bifurcation .",
    "this leads to the co - existence of a stable steady state and a stable periodic orbit , which has a profound effect on the dynamics of the system .",
    "when the default steady state is destabilized by the time delays , our numerical analysis shows that the system will always converge to the silenced steady state . on the other hand , in parameter regimes where time delays destabilize the silenced steady state",
    ", the system will either converge to the default steady state , or it will oscillate around the unstable steady state depending on the initial conditions .",
    "in fact , under the influence of time delays , one would requires an even higher initial dosage of dsrna to achieve sustained silencing .",
    "however , when there is stable periodic orbit around the silenced steady state , one would also have to consider the amplitude of these oscillations and how it may affect the phenotypic stability of the species in question .",
    "thus , the augmented model exhibits an enriched dynamical behavior compared to its predecessor which otherwise can only be replicated by different extensions to the core pathway , like the rnase model developed in @xcite , which assumes the presence of a specific sirna - degrading rnase with saturating kinetics .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and discuss its basic properties . in section 3 we identify all steady states of the model together with conditions for their biological feasibility .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the stability analysis of these steady states depending on model parameters , including numerical bifurcation analysis and simulations of the model that illustrate different types of dynamical behaviour .",
    "the paper concludes in section 6 with the discussion of results and open problems .",
    "to analyse the dynamics of rnai with primed amplification , following groenenboom et al .",
    "@xcite we consider the populations of mrna , dsrna , sirna and garbage ( aberrant ) rna , to be denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that mrna is constantly transcribed by each transgene at rate @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the number of transgenic copies , and is degraded at the rate @xmath7 . for simplicity",
    ", it will be assumed that each transgene produces the same amount of mrna .",
    "some dsrna is synthesized directly from mrna through the activity of rdrp at a rate @xmath8 .",
    "the available dsrna is cleaved by a dicer enzyme into @xmath9 sirna molecules at a rate @xmath10 . in this model",
    "it is assumed that sirna is involved into forming two distinct complexes that use the sirna as a guide to identify and associate with different categories of rna strands to initiate the dsrna synthesis .",
    "the first is the risc complex responsible for degrading mrna into garbage rna , which decays naturally at a rate @xmath11 . for simplicity ,",
    "the risc population is not explicitly included in the model , but it is rather assumed that sirna directly associates with mrna at a rate @xmath12 . the second complex guided by sirna binds mrna aberrant ( garbage ) rna , and subsequently is primed by rdrp to synthesize additional dsrna ( primed amplification ) . to avoid unnecessary complexity",
    ", the second complex will also be represented implicitly by assuming that sirna directly associates with mrna and garbage rna for the purpose of dsrna synthesis at the rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . at this point",
    ", we include two distinct time delays @xmath15 and @xmath16 to represent the delays inherent in the the production of dsrna from mrna and garbage rna , respectively . with these assumptions ,",
    "the system describing the dynamics of different rna populations takes the form @xmath17 with the initial conditions @xmath18,\\quad g(s ) = g_0(s)\\ge 0,\\quad s\\in[-\\tau_2,0],\\\\\\\\ s(s)=s_0(s)\\ge 0,\\quad s\\in[-\\tau,0],\\quad \\tau = \\max\\{\\tau_1,\\tau_2\\},\\quad d(0)\\ge0 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] before proceeding with the analysis of the model ( [ system : garbage ] ) , we have to establish that this system is well - posed , i.e. its solutions are non - negative and bounded .",
    "invariance of the positive orthant follows straightforwardly from the theorem 5.2.1 in @xcite .",

    "similarly , if initially @xmath30 , then @xmath31 would be monotonically decreasing , and once its value is below @xmath29 , it would never go above it .",

    "[ fig:4 ] , where the rate @xmath14 of forming rdrp - garbage complexes is varied . increasing this rate @xmath14 results in a reduced region of bi - stability and",
    "smaller values of the maximum mrna concentration , but at the same time , it does not result in the complete disappearance of the bi - stability region , as was the case when the rate @xmath13 was varied .",
    "comparing the influence of the rate @xmath8 , at which rdrp synthesises dsrna directly from the mrna , to the number of sirna @xmath9 produced by dicer per cleaved dsrna , one can notice that for sufficiently small @xmath9 and @xmath8 , only the steady state @xmath174 is feasible and stable , and , therefore , the strength of rna silencing is severely limited , with a relatively high concentration of mrna surviving , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig:59](a)-(b ) .",
    "this agrees very well with experimental observations in which plants carrying a mutation in rdrp can not synthesize trigger - dsrna directly from mrna , and , thus , fail to induce transgene - induced silencing @xcite , but similarly to mammals who do not carry rdrp , might experience transient silencing @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath8 , reduces the range of @xmath9 values , for which bi - stability occurs , and eventually it leads to the complete disappearance of the intermediate steady state @xmath172 . for higher value of @xmath8 ,",
    "the state @xmath171 can exhibit instability in a small range of @xmath9 values , and for even higher rates of dsrna production , this steady state is always stable , thus signifying that gene silencing has been achieved . from a biological perspective , this should be expected , as by increasing @xmath8 , more mrna can be used for dsrna synthesis , which is then used for the production of sirna , which in turn amplifies the process even further .",
    "this is consistent with experimental observations which show that strains of the fungus _ neurospora crassa _ , which overexpress rdrp , are able to progressively carry fewer transgenes without reverting back to their wild type . as such",
    ", even a single transgene is sufficient to induce gene silencing and thus preserve the phenotypic stability of the species @xcite .",
    "when one considers the relative effects of the degradation rates of mrna @xmath7 and garbage rna @xmath175 , it becomes clear that if the mrna decays quite slowly , while garbage rna decays fast , in a certain range of @xmath175 values the system does not converge to any steady states but rather exhibits periodic solutions , as shown figs .",
    "[ fig:59](a)-(b ) . as the rate of mrna degradation",
    "is increased , this reduces the range of possible @xmath175 values where periodic behaviour is observed , until it eventually disappears completely .",
    "it is important to note that higher values of @xmath175 correspond to @xmath174 and lower values correspond to @xmath176 , which suggests that decreasing the rate @xmath175 of garbage rna degradation results in more of it being available for additional dsrna synthesis , which subsequently results in a more efficient gene silencing .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] shows how the region where the system ( [ system : garbage ] ) is bi - stable depends on the number of transgenes and the time delay @xmath16 , associated with a delayed production of dsrna from aberrant rna when the delay associated with production of dsrna from mrna is fixed at @xmath177 .",
    "this figure shows that when @xmath178 , the system is bi - stable in the approximate range @xmath179 , and for sufficiently small @xmath16 up until @xmath180 , the behaviour of the system remains largely unchanged , whereas for @xmath181 and sufficiently small number of transgenes , the silenced steady state @xmath176 loses stability . this stability can be regained for some higher values of @xmath16 , but then it will be lost again .",
    "steady states @xmath176 with higher values of @xmath6 are not affected by the variations in @xmath16 and remain stable throughout the bi - stability region . in a similar way , the steady state @xmath174 can also lose its stability , but unlike @xmath176 , this happens for high values of transgenes , and the range of @xmath6 values where instability happens is smaller than for @xmath176 .",
    "these results suggest that the time delays associated with primed amplification can result in a destabilisation of the steady states @xmath176 and @xmath174 , thus disrupting gene silencing . when both time delays are varied , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:11 ] and [ fig:14 ] , the steady state @xmath174 without sufficient silencing is always stable , whereas increasing @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 causes the silenced steady state @xmath176 to switch between being stable or unstable .",
    "we note that the boundaries of the stability crossing curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] are analytically described by ( [ stab_curves ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:14 ] illustrates that whilst the time delays do not affect the shape of the hysteresis curve , they can cause some extra parts of it to be unstable , which happens for smaller values of the time delay to @xmath176 only , and for higher values of the time delays to @xmath174 as well .",
    "a possible interpretation of this result is that the feedback loop in the model is highly sensitive to the speed dsrna production from its constituent parts . when the dsrna synthesis is hindered by the time delays",
    ", the production can not maintain the required consistent pace , and , as a result , one of the steady states loses stability , which gives birth to stable periodic solutions .",
    "figures  [ fig:12 ] and [ fig:13 ] illustrate how the initial dosage of the dsrna @xmath182 , garbage rna @xmath183 and mrna @xmath184 affect the behaviour of the model . starting with the smaller number of transgenes , for which the system ( [ system : garbage ] ) is bi - stable",
    "we see that in figs .",
    "[ fig:12](a),(b ) and figs .",
    "[ fig:13](a),(b ) , when the delays @xmath15 and @xmath16 are both set to zero , the system mostly converges to the steady state with a relatively high concentration of mrna @xmath174 for smaller numbers of transgenes @xmath6 , and to the steady state with a lower concentration of mrna @xmath176 for higher numbers of transgenes @xmath6 . as the time delays associated with the primed amplification increase , this increases the basin of attraction of @xmath176 for smaller @xmath6 , and the basin of attraction of @xmath174 for higher @xmath6 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:12],[fig:13](c ) and figs .",
    "[ fig:12],[fig:13](d ) , respectively .",
    "these figures suggest that for sufficiently high dosage of dsrna and initial garbage rna or mrna being present in the cell , the system achieves a stable steady state where gene silencing is sustained . for higher values of the time delays",
    ", there is a qualitative difference in behaviour between lower and higher numbers of transgenes . for lower numbers of transgenes , the system exhibits a bi - stability between a stable steady state @xmath174 with a high concentration of mrna and a periodic orbit around the now unstable steady state @xmath176 . on the other hand , for higher values of @xmath6 ,",
    "there is still a bi - stability between @xmath176 and @xmath174 .",
    "whilst in this case , the system may appear not to be as sensitive to the effects of time delays in the primed amplification pathway , it is still evident that in the presence of time delays one generally requires a higher initial dosage of dsrna to achieve sustained silencing .",
    "furthermore , in the narrow range of @xmath6 values , where the steady state @xmath174 is destabilised by the time delays , numerical simulations show that the system always moves towards a stable steady state @xmath176 rather than oscillate around @xmath174 , thus suggesting that the hopf bifurcation of the steady state is subcritical .",
    "to illustrate the dynamics of the system ( [ system : garbage ] ) in different dynamical regimes , we have solved this system numerically , and the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ num_sim ] .",
    "figures ( a ) and ( b ) demonstrate the regime of bi - stability shown in figs .  [",
    "fig:12],[fig:13](e ) , where under the presence of both time delays and depending on the initial conditions , the system either approaches the default stable steady state @xmath174 under a low initial dsrna dosage , or tends to a periodic orbit around the silenced steady state @xmath176 despite a high initial dsrna dosage .",
    "figure ( c ) corresponds to a situation where the number of transgenes is sufficiently high , and the steady state @xmath174 is destabilised by the time delays , in which case the system approaches a silenced steady state @xmath176 .",
    "it is interesting to note that prior to settling on the silenced state @xmath176 , the system exhibits a prolonged period of oscillations around this state - a phenomenon very similar to the one observed in models of autoimmune dynamics @xcite , where the system can also show oscillations and then settle on some chronic steady state .",
    "this behaviour highlights an important issue that during experiments one has to be able to robustly distinguish between genuine sustained oscillations and long - term transient oscillations that eventually settle on a steady state .",
    "in this paper we have considered a model of rna interference with two primed amplification pathways associated with the production of dsrna from sirna and two separate rdrp - carrying complexes formed by targeting mrna and garbage rna . for better biological realism ,",
    "we have explicitly included distinct time delays for each of these pathways to account for delays inherent in dsrna synthesis .",
    "the system is shown to exhibit up to three biologically feasible steady states , with a relatively low @xmath185 , medium @xmath186 , or high ( @xmath174 ) concentration of mrna .",
    "stability analysis of the model has shed light onto relative importance of different system parameters . for sufficiently small levels of host mrna ,",
    "the system has a single stable steady state @xmath174 , whose mrna concentration is growing with the number of transgenes @xmath6 .",
    "experimental observations suggest that the amount of transcribed mrna is an important factor in the ability of transcripts to trigger silencing .",
    "production of mrna can generally be enhanced in two ways : either the target transgene is under control of a 35s promoter with a double enhancer so that the gene is transcribed at a higher rate @xcite , or there are enough transgenic copies to maintain an adequate production of mrna to trigger silencing . in our model , the number of trangenes @xmath6 and the transcription rate of mrna @xmath5 are qualitatively interchangeable .",
    "hence , as the number of transgenes increases , there is a range of transgenic copies for which the system is bi - stable , exhibiting steady states with a high ( @xmath174 ) and low @xmath185 mrna concentrations , where @xmath176 describes a silenced state . for higher values of @xmath6 ,",
    "only the steady state @xmath176 is feasible and stable , suggesting that a sustained state of gene silencing is achieved . from a biological perspective",
    ", it is very interesting and important to note that in the bi - stable region , it is not only the parameters , but also the initial conditions that determine whether rna silencing occurs .",
    "this implies that the dosage of dsrna , which initialises the rna interference mechanism , as well as the current levels of mrna and garbage rna within the cell , determine the evolution of the system . in the absence of time delays , a high dosage of dsrna and an initial concentration of mrna or garbage rna results in a silenced steady state .    in the case",
    "when the delays associated with the primed amplification are non - zero , our analysis shows that for specific range of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , both steady states @xmath176 or @xmath174 can lose stability in the bistable region . once again , not only the parameters , but also the initial conditions control whether the system will converge to the remaining stable state or will oscillate around the unstable steady state .",
    "additionally , in the presence of time delays , one generally requires an even higher initial dosage of dsrna to achieve sustained silencing compared to the non - delayed model .",
    "interestingly , oscillations can only happen around the silenced steady state @xmath176 , and when the steady state @xmath174 loses its stability , the system just moves towards a stable steady state @xmath176 .",
    "oscillations around @xmath176 biologically correspond to switching between higher and lower concentrations of mrna , implying that at certain moments during time evolution , the exogenous mrna is silenced , and at other times it is not affected by the rnai .",
    "it follows that this switching behaviour might have case - specific implications for the phenotypic stability of a species , which most likely depends on the amplitude of oscillations around the silenced steady state .",
    "the biological significance of this result lies in the fact that there are cases where even a high initial dosage of dsrna will not always result in a silenced steady state .",
    "thus , the augmented model exhibits an enriched dynamical behavior compared to its predecessor which otherwise can only be replicated by different extensions to the core pathway , like the rnase model developed in @xcite , which assumes the presence of a specific sirna - degrading rnase with saturating kinetics .",
    "an interesting open question is whether the switching behavior could also act as a form of protection against the self - inflicted response to an erroneous distinction of target mrna , and whether periodic silencing can , to some extent , minimise the damage to the host cell .",
    "another issue is that the time delays considered in the model are assumed to be discrete , and hence it would be very insightful and relevant from a biological perspective to investigate how stability results for this model would change in the case where the time delays obey some distribution .",
    "recent results suggest that distributed delays can in some instances increase @xcite , and in others reduce @xcite parameter regions where oscillations are suppressed .",
    "our future research will look into the effects of distributed time delays on primed amplification in rnai .",
