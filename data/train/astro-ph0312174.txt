    "increasingly accurate measurements of the anisotropy in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has ushered in an era of precision cosmology .",
    "a golden decade of cmb anisotropy measurements by numerous experiments was topped by the results from the first year of data obtained by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite . under simple hypotheses for the spectrum of primordial perturbations , exquisite estimates of the cosmological parameters",
    "have been obtained from the angular power spectrum measurement by wmap combined with other cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "although the assumed , scale free ( with mild deviations ) , initial power spectra may be a generic prediction of the simplest scenarios of generation of perturbations during inflation , initial spectra with radical deviations are known to arise from very reasonable extensions , or , refinements to the simplest scenarios  @xcite .",
    "consequently , cosmological parameter estimation from the cmb anisotropy and the matter power spectrum obtained from redshift surveys , weak gravitational lensing and ly-@xmath5 absorption , depends sensitively on the dimensionality , nature and freedom in the parameter space of initial conditions  @xcite .    the angular power spectrum , @xmath0 , is a convolution of the initial power spectrum @xmath1 generated in the early universe with a radiative transport kernel , @xmath6 , that is determined by the current values of the cosmological parameters . the remarkably precise observations of the angular power spectrum @xmath0 by wmap , and the concordance of cosmological parameters measured from different cosmological observations opens up the avenue to directly recover the initial power spectrum of the density perturbation from the observations .",
    "the richardson - lucy ( rl ) method deconvolution was shown to be a promising and powerful method to measure the power spectrum of initial perturbations from the cmb angular power spectrum  @xcite . in this paper , we apply the method to the cmb anisotropy spectrum measured by wmap . we have also devised and implemented an improvement to the rl scheme , whereby the iterative deconvolution algorithm is designed to converge and _",
    "match the measurements only within the given error - bars .",
    "_    the direct numerical deconvolution has clear advantages over the other prevalent approach of obtaining the most likely parameter values for a parametric model primordial spectra   space ` bins ' carried out with recent data is a somewhat model independent  @xcite .",
    "direct deconvolution with different method  @xcite has been attempted  @xcite ] .",
    "first , as emerges from our work , the direct method can reveal features that are not anticipated by the parametric model spectra , hence would be completely missed out in the latter approach .",
    "second , in the absence of an accepted early universe scenario ( more narrowly , a favored model of inflation ) , it is difficult to _ a priori _ set up and justify the chosen space of initial conditions .",
    "the complex covariances between the cosmological and the initial parameters are sensitive to the parameterization of the space of initial spectra adopted .",
    "efforts along these lines are further obscured by issues such as the applicability of the occam s razor to dissuade extension of the parameter space of initial conditions .",
    "such deliberations have been recently framed in the more quantitative language of bayesian evidence to evaluate and select between possible parameterizations  @xcite . however , this approach can not really point to a preferred parameterization .",
    "whereas , in the direct approach we can evade the issue of appropriate parameterization of the initial power spectrum . for a given set of cosmological parameters , our method obtains the primordial power spectrum that ` maximizes ' the likelihood .",
    "hence , the space of parameters remains that of the ( more widely accepted and agreed up on ) cosmological parameters alone . in principle , it is possible to explore the entire space of cosmological parameters along the lines being done routinely , and instead of simply computing the likelihood for a given model initial power spectrum , one obtains the initial power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood at that point and assigns that likelihood to that point in the space of cosmological parameters  .",
    "however , in this paper we limit ourselves to obtaining the primordial spectrum for a few given sets of ` best fit ' cosmological parameters and showing that recovered @xmath1 is robust to small local variations in the cosmological parameters .",
