    "reinhardt polygons are a class of convex polygons that are optimal in three different geometric optimization problems : they have maximal perimeter and maximal width with respect to their diameter , and maximal width relative to their perimeter .",
    "further , for @xmath0 not a power of @xmath1 , the reinhardt polygons with @xmath0 sides are precisely the optimal convex polygons in these three problems .",
    "we describe reinhardt polygons only briefly here ; for more details we direct the reader to .",
    "a _ reinhardt polygon _ is an equilateral convex polygon @xmath8 that may be inscribed in a reuleaux polygon @xmath9 in such a way that every vertex of @xmath9 is a vertex of @xmath8 .",
    "if we define the _ skeleton _ of a polygon to be its vertices , together with the line segments that connect vertices at maximal distance from one another , then it follows that the skeleton of a reinhardt polygon with @xmath0 sides contains a star polygon , where each interior angle has measure an integer multiple of @xmath10 . for example , when @xmath0 is odd , the regular @xmath0-gon is a reuleaux polygon , and its associated skeleton is the regular star polygon with @xmath0 points .",
    "a reinhardt polygon can be described by naming the measures of each of the angles of its associated star polygon , in the order of their visitation as one traverses it edges . since",
    "each angle is @xmath11 for some integer @xmath12 , and their sum is @xmath13 , it follows that we may describe a reuleaux polygon as a composition of @xmath0 into an odd number of parts @xmath14 : @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "further , since we consider two polygons to be equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by some combination of rotations and flips , we associate a reinhardt polygon with an equivalence class of such compositions under a dihedral action .",
    "such an equivalence class is called a _",
    "dihedral composition_.    figure  [ figreinhardt30 ] exhibits six reinhardt polygons with @xmath16 sides , along with their associated dihedral compositions .",
    "the skeleton of each polygon is exhibited in the network of line segments within it , and the subset of each skeleton forming the associated star polygon is depicted with thicker lines . the first row of the polygons here have an evident periodic structure : for these , the associated composition is a composition for some divisor @xmath17 of @xmath0 into an odd number of parts , repeated @xmath18 times , and the polygon exhibits a corresponding rotational symmetry . in these cases",
    "we abbreviate the composition by writing just the composition of @xmath17 , together with @xmath18 as an exponent to show the number of times the sequence is repeated .",
    "reinhardt polygons with this property are called _ periodic reinhardt polygons _ , and these are well understood . in @xcite , a formula for the number of such polygons is derived ( and independently in @xcite for the case of cyclic equivalence classes ) .",
    "if we let @xmath19 denote the number of periodic reinhardt polygons with @xmath0 sides under dihedral equivalence classes , then it follows from this formula that @xmath20 for positive integers @xmath0 with smallest odd prime divisor @xmath3 .",
    "we remark that there are several additional periodic reinhardt @xmath21-gons , beyond the three shown in figure  [ figreinhardt30 ] , since @xmath22 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we close this section by considering the case @xmath6 , beginning with a proof of the second theorem announced in the introduction .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the number of periodic reinhardt @xmath23-gons is @xmath24 , and the method of @xcite showed that @xmath25 . using the current construction , we compute @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the methods of @xcite allow us to count a number of additional qualifying polygons .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the number of sporadic reinhardt polygons with @xmath0 sides whose corresponding dihedral composition has largest part @xmath17 .",
    "the values of @xmath28 for @xmath29 and for @xmath30 were computed in @xcite , and the sum of these values is @xmath31 . of these",
    ", we find that @xmath32 can not be generated by the method of section  [ secconstruction ] .",
    "we therefore need more than @xmath33 million additional sporadic polygons to show that @xmath34 , and we find these by computing @xmath28 for a few additional values of @xmath17 . by enumerating the dihedral compositions of @xmath23 with an odd number of parts and largest part @xmath17 , and removing those with a periodic structure , we compute @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . of these @xmath39 polygons ,",
    "@xmath40 can not be generated by our construction .",
    "we conclude that @xmath41 .",
    "finally , there are only thirteen positive integers @xmath42 having the form @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 distinct odd primes and @xmath5 : they are @xmath16 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . table  1 of @xcite verifies that @xmath55 for each of these values .",
    "because our construction finds @xmath56 of all of the sporadic reinhardt @xmath23-gons whose corresponding composition has restricted largest part in the ranges we considered , we might expect the true value of @xmath57 to be over @xmath58 million .",
    "last , we remark that it may be possible to generalize our method for constructing reinhardt polynomials by accounting for additional odd prime factors . for example , let @xmath59 , where the coefficients of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are @xmath63 the coefficient sequence for @xmath64 is then @xmath65 and so @xmath64 is a reinhardt polynomial for @xmath6 .",
    "however , @xmath64 can not be generated by using our algorithm . to see this , suppose @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and suppose that @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . by observing the constant term and the coefficients of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 in @xmath64 ( respectively @xmath74 , @xmath74 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 )",
    ", we find @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . subtracting the fourth equation from",
    "the first produces @xmath80 , but adding the second and third equations yields @xmath81 , a contradiction .",
    "similar analyses show that there are no decompositions using only @xmath60 and @xmath62 , or using only @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we show that our method constructs all reinhardt polygons when @xmath7 . to establish this",
    ", we first require a generalization of @xcite*lemma  2.2 , which is the case @xmath82 of the following statement .",
    "[ lemgenldecomp ] let @xmath83 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 distinct odd primes and @xmath84 , and suppose that @xmath64 is a reinhardt polynomial for @xmath0",
    ". then there exist polynomials @xmath85 and @xmath86 with integer coefficients , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 further , we may choose @xmath85 and @xmath86 to have all their coefficients in @xmath90 .",
    "we omit the proof , as it is very similar to the one presented in @xcite , and may be obtained in essence by replacing each occurrence of @xmath91 when it appears as an argument of a cyclotomic polynomial in that proof with @xmath92 .",
    "( the roles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 have also been interchanged for convenience here . )",
    "let @xmath7 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 distinct odd primes . clearly , @xmath93 is the only possible composition of @xmath94 into an even number of parts . by lemma [ lem : symmetry ] ,",
    "there are no additional sporadic reinhardt polynomials introduced by reversing the roles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the construction .",
    "hence corollary  [ corboundsporadicpolygons ] produces @xmath95 .",
    "we need to show that there are no additional sporadic reinhardt polynomials that are not accounted for by our construction in section [ secconstruction ] , up to dihedral equivalence .",
    "that is , we wish to show that @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 be a sporadic reinhardt polynomial for @xmath0 .",
    "by lemma  [ lemgenldecomp ] , there exist polynomials @xmath85 and @xmath86 with all coefficients in @xmath90 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , such that @xmath100",
    ". write @xmath101 so that @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 . to show that @xmath96 , we will establish the following seven statements .",
    "a.   there exist @xmath106 mod @xmath1 and @xmath107 mod @xmath1 such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "[ step:1 ] b.   there exist @xmath106 mod @xmath1 and @xmath107 mod @xmath1 such that @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "[ step:2 ] c.   there exist @xmath106 mod @xmath1 and @xmath112 mod @xmath1 such that @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and similarly for @xmath107 mod @xmath1 and @xmath115 mod @xmath1 .",
    "[ step:3 ] d.   there exist @xmath116 such that @xmath117 and @xmath118 [ step:4 ] e.   we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath119 . [ step:5 ] f.   for each @xmath120 , the pair @xmath121`0 + ` , ` + 0`@xmath122 . these are blocks of the form @xmath123 , as required in .",
    "[ step:6 ] g.   for each @xmath120 , the pair @xmath124`00 ` , ` -+`@xmath122 .",
    "these are blocks of the form @xmath125 , as required in .",
    "[ step:7 ]    this will complete the proof , as we will have shown that every sporadic reinhardt polynomial for @xmath0 can be constructed by using the algorithm of section [ secconstruction ] .    for ( [ step:1 ] ) , if @xmath110 for all @xmath106 mod @xmath1 , then @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a reinhardt polynomial for @xmath128 . by (",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , @xmath127 is periodic , and hence @xmath64 is periodic , which contradicts our hypothesis .",

    "the roles of @xmath156 and @xmath157 are symmetric in this argument , so we reach the same conclusion in the other case , where @xmath158 and @xmath159 . thus , there exists an even index @xmath129 where @xmath110 .",
    "the case where @xmath107 mod @xmath1 is similar .    for ( [ step:3 ] )",
    ", we show that there exist even @xmath129 and @xmath160 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "a similar argument handles the case where @xmath130 and @xmath161 are both odd . using ( [ step:2 ] ) ,",

    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "if there also exists an even @xmath160where @xmath114 , we are done , so assume instead that @xmath168 for all even indices @xmath160 .",
    "consider the three sequences @xmath169 by noticing that @xmath170 , we have that the first sequence above starts and ends with nonzero terms of opposite sign .",
    "further , as @xmath64 is a reinhardt polynomial , the nonzero terms in the first sequence must have alternating sign .",
    "the number of nonzero terms in the second sequence is constant for all @xmath120 by periodicity , so the number of nonzero terms contributed from the third sequence must have the same parity for all @xmath120 ( either always even , or always odd ) .",
    "further , the @xmath137 can only be nonzero if @xmath130 is odd by assumption . by the chinese remainder theorem and the periodicity of the @xmath137",
    ", we then see that @xmath171 has the same number of nonzero terms for all @xmath120 .",
    "hence either all of the @xmath137 with @xmath130 odd are nonzero , or they are all zero .",
    "they can not all be zero , for otherwise @xmath86 would be trivial .",
    "hence @xmath172 for each odd @xmath130 . from ( [ step:2 ] ) , there exists an odd @xmath173 such that @xmath174 , so @xmath175 .",
    "the periodicity of the @xmath140 and @xmath137 then implies that @xmath176 for each @xmath120 , and this produces that @xmath86 is periodic with respect to @xmath141 .",
    "thus @xmath64 is periodic , a contradiction .",
    "therefore , there exist even @xmath129 and @xmath160 such that @xmath113 and @xmath114 .    using this ,",
    "we now show that there exist @xmath116 that satisfy and .",
    "consider the case when @xmath177 such that @xmath113 and @xmath114 . by the chinese remainder theorem and the periodicity of the @xmath140 and @xmath137",
    ", we have that @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "this establishes ( [ step:4 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath64 is a reinhardt polynomial , it has an odd number of nonzero coefficients .",
    "thus , exactly one of @xmath85 or @xmath86 has an odd number of nonzero coefficients . by reversing the roles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 if necessary",
    ", we may assume that @xmath85 has an odd number of them , and @xmath86 has an even number .",
    "note that @xmath86 can not have an equal number of zero and nonzero coefficients , since @xmath4 is odd .",
    "if @xmath86 has more zero coefficients than nonzero coefficients , consider the transformation @xmath180 by and , this remains a valid decomposition of @xmath64 , @xmath181 has an even number of nonzero coefficients , and @xmath182 has an odd number . in addition , @xmath181 has more nonzero coefficients than zero coefficients .",
