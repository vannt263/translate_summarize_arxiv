    "in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , there are two main sources of gev afterglow photons .",
    "one is the _ prompt emission _ itself , which lasts for @xmath0 s ( e.g. sakamoto et al 2007 , willingale et al 2007 ) , has a broken power - law spectrum @xmath1 peaking at @xmath2 kev , above which @xmath3 with @xmath4 and a 25 kev  1 mev fluence @xmath5 ( for long bursts ) ( e.g. preece et al 2000 ) . the other one is the _ afterglow emission _ which , at x - rays , exhibits a plateau at 0.330 ks characterized by a 1 kev flux @xmath6 , a power - law spectrum @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( e.g. obrien et al 2006 , willingale et al 2007 ) and a power - law decay @xmath9 with @xmath10 ( e.g. nousek et al 2006 ) .",
    "in addition to the above `` direct '' sources of high - energy ( gev ) afterglow photons , a fraction of the hard x - ray photons from burst and soft x - ray photons from afterglow can be upscattered in the gev range either through inverse - compton off relativistic electrons or bulk - scattering off a faster part of the outflow . in this work ,",
    "we evaluate the gev afterglow fluxes expected from these direct and scattering mechanisms and compare them to the sensitivity of the large area telescope ( lat ) at 1 gev for a 1 ks observation , @xmath11 , corresponding to 5 photons being collected .",
    "another mechanism directly related to those at work in grbs and their afterglows , which can produce _ afterglow _ emission above 100 mev is the inverse - compton scattering of flaring internal - shock emission passing through the forward - shock ( fan & piran 2006 ; wang , li & mszros 2006 ; fan et al 2007 , galli & piro 2007 ) .",
    "that scenario is not considered here .",
    "other processes which rely on mechanisms that are not directly related to the production of the grb and afterglow emissions ( e.g. synchrotron emission from vhe protons , synchrotron radiation from pairs and muons produced in photo - hadronic processes ) and whose high - energy emission is highly uncertain , are also ignored .",
    "owing to relativistic beaming and geometrical curvature of spherical grb source , during the burst , the observer receives emission mainly from a patch moving toward the observer and extending an angle opening @xmath12 as seen from the center of fireball , where @xmath13 is the lorentz factor of the source .",
    "although the burst emission mechanism ceases to operate after 10100 s , the observer continues to receive emission from regions of the grb source moving at angles @xmath14 relative to the center  observer axis ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "this `` large - angle '' emission arrives at observer at time @xmath15 and is relativistically boosted by a factor @xmath16 , hence @xmath17 is progressively decreasing with observer time . from here",
    ", it can be shown that the large - angle burst emission at photon energy @xmath18 above the burst spectral peak energy @xmath19 is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the flux at energy @xmath18 during the burst and @xmath22 is the burst average flux at the photon energy @xmath19 , which can be approximated by @xmath23 .",
    "assuming that the power - law spectrum of the prompt emission extends up to above gev photon energies , the large - angle burst emission at @xmath24 is given by ( f_)^(lae ) = ( ) ^1- _ ( ) ^-2- _ .",
    "for the representative burst quantities given in ",
    "[ intro ] , the large - angle flux at photon energy @xmath25 gev is ( f_)^(lae ) 1 = 1 10 ^ -6(_+1 ) _",
    "-5 t_,1^_+1 1 ( 1 1 ) ^1 _ -1 h ( ) ^1 -2- _ h [ lae ] where the notation @xmath26 was used , the photon energy being measured in ev .",
    "equation ( [ lae ] ) shows that , at 1 ks after trigger , the gev large - angle emission may be detected by lat at 1 gev for @xmath27 the hardest bursts ( @xmath28 ) , for which @xmath29 , or for @xmath30 the harder ( @xmath31 ) , longest , and brightest bursts ( @xmath32 s , @xmath33 ) , for which @xmath34 .",
    "bursts in either category are extremely rare ( perhaps less than 1 percent of batse grbs have those properties ) , thus is seems very unlikely that the large - angle burst emission could produce 1 gev photons that lat can detect at 1 ks from trigger .",
    "owing to its very fast decay , there is a much better chance to detect the large - angle emission at earlier times ( e.g. at 100 s ) .      if the soft x - ray ( 110 kev ) power - law spectrum measured by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on swift extends over more than 5 orders of magnitude in photon energy above 10 kev , then the observed x - ray flux ( f_)_1kev = 10 ^ -111 ( t/1)^-_x [ fx ] implies a gev afterglow flux @xmath35 which is ( f_)^(aglow ) = 10 ^ -(5 + 6_x ) ( f_)_1kev,-11 _ 9 ^ 1-_x .",
    "[ fs ] therefore , lat - detectable gev emission arising from the same mechanism as that for the x - ray afterglow emission is obtained for @xmath36 .",
    "such hard spectra are measured for about 10 percent of swift afterglows .",
    "if the x - ray afterglow is the synchrotron emission from the forward - shock driven by the grb ejecta into the circumburst medium ( mszros & rees 1997 ) , then the assumption that the soft x - ray spectrum @xmath37 extends up to gev energies is quite likely wrong , particularly for the harder afterglow spectra ( @xmath38 ) :    \\(1 ) if the soft x - ray band were above the `` cooling '' frequency ( @xmath39 ) of the synchrotron spectrum , then the electrons accelerated by the forward - shock would have a power - law distribution with energy ( @xmath40 ) flatter than @xmath41 , which implies that @xmath42 must have a cut - off at some electron energy for which the synchrotron characteristic frequency is above x - ray . however",
    ", that the electrons radiating at 1 gev must have an energy larger by a factor @xmath43 than those radiating at 1 kev , suggests that the synchrotron frequency cut - off associated with the maximum electron energy is below 1 gev .",
    "\\(2 ) if the soft x - ray range is below @xmath39 , then the gev flux depends on the exact location of @xmath39 . for 10 grb afterglows with a good coverage at radio , optical , and x - ray , through modelling their multiwavelength measurements ,",
    "we have found shock microphysical parameters , shock kinetic energies , and ambient medium densities for which @xmath39 should be between optical and soft x - ray at 1 ks ( panaitescu 2005 ) .",
    "this suggests that , if other afterglows have similar forward - shock parameters , their cooling frequency is never too much above the soft x - ray range .",
    "taking into account that the spectrum of the forward - shock synchrotron emission should be @xmath44 above @xmath39 , it follows that , for @xmath39 around 100 kev , the gev flux is a factor @xmath45 lower than that given in equation ( [ fs ] ) .",
    "then , the gev flux from the forward - shock synchrotron emission would be detected by lat only for the hardest ( @xmath46 ) and brightest ( @xmath47 ) afterglows observed by xrt .",
    "if the x - ray afterglow is the forward - shock synchrotron emission upscattered in a different part of the outflow ( see  [ bulk ] ) , then the upscattered @xmath39 could be above 1 mev and the likelihood of detecting gev photons from the same mechanism as that yielding the x - ray afterglow will be larger , although still restricted to a minority of afterglows with the hardest x - ray emission .",
    "we consider now the upscattering of the x - ray synchrotron forward - shock emission by the same electrons , the model for gev _ afterglow _ emission that has received most attention so far ( e.g. mszros & rees 1994 , panaitescu & mszros 1997 , dermer , chiang & mitman 2000 , zhang & mszros 2001 , peer & waxman 2005 , fan et al 2007 ) .",
    "galli & piro ( 2007 ) offer a detailed treatment of this emission and comparison with lat s detection capability . in contrast to these works ,",
    "we want to estimate the gev inverse - compton flux expected for the observed x - ray synchrotron forward - shock flux by making minimal use of the usual afterglow parameters .    at a photon energy above the peak frequency of the scattered emission ( @xmath48 ) ,",
    "the flux of the inverse - compton forward - shock emission is ( f_)^(ic ) = ( f_)_p^(ic ) ( /_p^(ic))^1-_x where @xmath49 is the peak flux of the inverse - compton afterglow spectrum .",
    "the spectral quantities of the upscattered emission can be related to those of the synchrotron s : _",
    "p^(ic ) = _ e^2 _ p^(sy ) , f_,p^(ic ) = _ e f_,p^(sy ) where @xmath50 is the lorentz factor of the electrons which radiate at the peak frequency @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the optical thickness of the forward - shock to electron scattering .",
    "the observed x - ray emission at 1 kev is @xmath53 , thus ( f_)^(ic ) = ( f_)_1kev ( /1kev)^1-_x _ e^2_x _ e . [ fic ]    if the grb progenitor is a wolf - rayet star , the mass swept - up by the forward - shock is @xmath54 g , assuming a typical mass - loss rate @xmath55 and wind velocity @xmath56 ) .",
    "conservation of the forward - shock energy @xmath57 during its interaction with the stellar wind , @xmath58 , and the relation between the shocks radius and the arrival time of photons emitted by the region moving at an angle @xmath59 relative to the direction toward the observer , @xmath60 , lead to a lorentz factor of the shocked circumburst medium _",
    "fs = 42 ( e_fs,53/a_*)^1/4 ( t/1)^-1/4 [ gfs ] and radius r_fs = 2.3 10 ^ 16 ( e_fs,53/a_*)^1/2 ( t/1)^1/2 [ rfs ] for a burst at redshift @xmath61 , where @xmath62 ( for galactic wr stars , the wind parameter @xmath63 varies from 0.3 to 2  nugis & lamers 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , the forward - shock optical thickness to electron scattering is _",
    "e = 10 ^ -5 e_fs,53 ^ -1/2 a_*^3/2 ( t/1)^-1/2 [ taufs ] where @xmath64 is the thomson cross - section for electron scattering .",
    "the hardest x - ray spectra ( @xmath65 ) measured by xrt indicate that , at least for some afterglow , the cooling frequency of the synchrotron emission is above x - ray . for simplicity , we assume that this generally valid , hence @xmath50 of equation ( [ fic ] ) ) is the typical lorentz factor of the electrons accelerated by the forward - shock , parameterized by the fraction of the post - shock energy that the electrons acquire ( if they all had same lorentz factor @xmath50 ) : _ e m_e c^2 = _ e _",
    "fs m_p c^2 where @xmath66 is its internal energy per proton .",
    "then , equation ( [ gfs ] ) leads to _ e = 3800 ( _ e/0.05 ) ( e_fs,53/a_*)^1/4 ( t/1)^-1/4 [ gmel ] where the fractional electron energy was normalized to the maximum value found by panaitescu ( 2005 ) from modelling the afterglow emission .",
    "xrt observations show that the peak frequency of the synchrotron forward - shock spectrum ( @xmath51 ) is below 0.3 kev before 1 ks after trigger thus , for the electron lorentz factor of equation ( [ gmel ] ) , the peak frequency of the upscattered emission ( @xmath48 ) at 1 ks should be below the gev range .    combining equations ( [ fic ] ) , ( [ taufs ] ) , and ( [ gmel ] ) , we obtain that , for the x - ray flux typically measured by xrt ( equation [ fx ] ) , the flux of the forward - shock self - compton flux should be @xmath67 ( f_)_1kev,-11 _ 9 ^ 1-_x ( ) ^1- [ ic ] with a weak dependence on the forward - shock s kinetic energy . therefore , for the typical @xmath68 measured by xrt , x - ray afterglows brighter than average should be accompanied by inverse - compton emission detectable to lat .",
    "most of the x - ray afterglows monitored by swift exhibit _ flares _ and light - curve _ plateaus _ at 0.110 ks after trigger .",
    "most flares evolve on a timescale shorter than the time when they occur ( burrows et al 2007 , chincarini et al 2007 ) , which indicates that they are not from the forward - shock . instead",
    ", flares have been attributed ( e.g. zhang et al 2006 ) to the same mechanism ( perhaps synchrotron and/or self - compton emission from _ internal shocks _ in a relativistic , unstable outflow ",
    "rees & mszros 1994 ) that produces the highly - variable burst emission .",
    "therefore , this scenario for x - ray flares require a long - lived central engine , expelling relativistic outflows at lab - frame times comparable to the observer time when the flares are seen .    during the x - ray plateau ,",
    "the 0.310 kev afterglow flux decays slower than expected for the forward - shock synchrotron emission , which prompted speculations that ( at least one ) of the basic assumptions is invalid .",
    "one plausible scenario is that energy is injected into the forward - shock by means of some late ejecta which catch - up with the forward shock as the latter undergoes deceleration by sweeping - up the ambient medium ( nousek et al 2006 , panaitescu et al 2006a , zhang et al 2006 ) . in that case , the plateau end marks a change in ( e.g. cessation of ) the power injected in the forward - shock .",
    "however , this interpretation encounters the following problem : a change in the forward - shock dynamics should be manifested in the afterglow light - curve at all frequencies , yet about half of the plateau ends which have been monitored in the optical do not occur in the optical as well , i.e. are _ chromatic _ ( watson et al 2006 , panaitescu et al 2006b ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for such chromatic x - ray light - curve breaks  the passage of a spectral break through the x - ray  is ruled out by that the hardness of the x - ray continuum does not evolve across the light - curve break ( willingale et al 2007 , liang et al 2007 ) .",
    "thus , the existence of x - ray flares and plateaus suggest a sustained ejection of relativistic material , but the chromatic x - ray breaks can not be explained by the injection of energy into the forward - shock produced by the late outflow catching - up with the shock . instead",
    ", those chromatic x - ray breaks suggest that there is a contribution to the afterglow flux that does not arise from the forward shock .    as shown by panaitescu ( 2007 ) ,",
    "bulk scattering of the forward - shock emission off the extended outflow required by x - ray flares can account for the observed decoupling of the optical and x - ray emissions because the scattered emission is likely to overshine that coming directly from the forward - shock only at higher ( x - ray ) but not at lower ( optical ) photon energies .",
    "for this to happen , the scattering outflow , inner to the forward - shock , must ( 1 ) move at a higher lorentz factor ( which is a natural consequence of the forward - shock deceleration caused by its interaction with the circumburst medium ) and , quite likely , ( 2 ) should be enriched with leptons above what is expected for normal , baryonic ejecta ( which suggests that the scattering outflow is not accelerated from within the collapsing star but , instead , it results from the dissipation of magnetic fields at large distances from the progenitor  the electromagnetic model of lyutikov 2006a ) .",
    "the first condition above implies that the brightness of the scattered emission received by observer at time @xmath69 depends on the lorentz factor and mass - flux ( i.e. optical thickness ) in the scattering outflow at a distance @xmath70 behind the forward - shock , consequently the observer - frame duration of the x - ray light - curve plateau is equal to the lab - frame light travel - time between the inner edge of the scattering outflow and the grb source .",
    "in addition to x - ray plateaus and chromatic breaks , the scattering model can also explain the short duration of x - ray flares ( shen et al 2007 have investigated the brightness of x - ray flares resulting from scattering the burst emission off geometrically thin , relativistic outflows ) and the observed diversity of post - plateau decays , some of which display very fast decays ( @xmath71 to @xmath72 ) .",
    "the former arises from that the reflection of the photons emitted by the forward - shock ( moving at @xmath73 ) off a surface moving at a higher lorentz factor ( @xmath74 ) reduces observer - frame timescales by a factor @xmath75 .",
    "the latter feature is naturally accommodated because the decay of the scattered emission depends on the radial distribution of mass - flux and lorentz factor in the scattering outflow .    a pair - rich outflow located behind the forward - shock provides two ways to produce gev afterglow photons .",
    "one is the scattering of x - ray forward - shock photons to higher energies .",
    "if the x - ray - to - gev photons arise from this mechanism then the fluxes at low and high photon energies are related through equation ( [ fs ] ) . as noted in  [ fs ] , in this model , the upscattered cooling frequency could be above 1 mev , thus the scattered forward - shock emission of the brightest and hardest x - ray afterglows may be detected by lat .",
    "gev photons are also produced through scattering of the prompt , grb emission .",
    "the dependence of the scattered grb emission on the various burst and scattering outflow parameters can be obtained as follows . for seed photons moving radially inward and scattered photons moving radially outward along the observer",
    " center of explosion , the doppler factor for the scatterer  grb source relative motion is @xmath76 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath27 the observed scattered and seed photon energies are a larger by a factor @xmath74 and @xmath13 , respectively , than in the corresponding source frame , @xmath30 bulk - scattering increases the energy of the seed photon by a factor @xmath77 , and @xmath78 if the scattering electrons are hot ( of random lorentz factor @xmath50 ) , then inverse - compton scattering boosts the energy of the primary photon by a factor @xmath79 ( in the frame of the scattering outflow ) , it follows that the peak of the scattered emission is at a photon energy _",
    "p^(sc ) = ( _ sc _ e / _ grb)^2 _ p [ scnup ] where @xmath19 is the peak photon energy of the burst spectrum .",
    "if the scatterer were infinitesimally thin ( a surface ) , then the spectral peak flux of the scattered emission would be f_p^(sc ) = ( 1-e^-_e ) ( _ sc/_grb)^2 f_p [ fsc ] where @xmath22 is the burst flux at the peak of its spectrum .",
    "the first factor represents the fraction of incident photons that are upscattered , the second is the product of a factor @xmath80 accounting for the effect of time contraction on the received peak - fluxes and a factor @xmath77 accounting for the effect of scattering due to the relative motion of the scatterer and grb source .",
    "we note that the motion of the two sources toward the observer does enhance the comoving specific intensities by factors @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( one factor for time contraction , two powers for angular beaming ) , however the received fluxes `` lose '' the angular - beaming factor @xmath83 because this effect also reduces the fractional area of the spherical source whose emission is beamed toward the observer by a factor @xmath83 . the relative motion of the scatterer and grb source enhances the intensity of the incident flux by a factor @xmath84 ; however , in the scatterer s frame , the highly collimated incident flux , arriving from within @xmath85 around the radial direction of motion ( owing to relativistic beaming ) is nearly isotropically redistributed by electron scattering , hence the net increase in intensity produced by scattering is just a factor @xmath77 .",
    "the grb emission scattered by a surface is spread ( in the observer frame ) over a time @xmath86 ( this is both the angular spread in the photon arrival time and the time to sweep - up the photons released by the grb source ) . for a radially - extended scattering outflow , the scattered grb emission is further spread over an observer - frame equal to the light travel - time from the inner to the outer edges of the scattering outflow . as the x - ray plateau results from upscattering by the same outflow ( but of the forward - shock emission ) ,",
    "the geometrical thickness of the scattering outflow is approximately equal to the duration @xmath87 of the x - ray plateau .",
    "therefore , for @xmath88 , a burst duration @xmath89 s , and an x - ray plateau lasting for @xmath90 ks , the photon arrival - time spread arising from the radial extent of the scattering outflow is dominant and the received flux is lower than that given in equation ( [ fsc ] ) by a factor @xmath91 .    the scattering outflow lags by @xmath92 ks behind the grb source , whose radius is @xmath93 ks cm is obtained by lyutikov ( 2006b ) from the timing of the grb tail , assuming @xmath94 .",
    "a similarly large burst radius is obtained by kumar et al ( 2007 ) for a set of 10 grbs from the the grb tail epoch and from that the forward - shock is already decelerating when the x - ray afterglow emission emerges .",
    "then , the @xmath95 s variability timescale typically observed can be accommodated if the grb emission arises from hot - spots whose angular extent is ( much ) smaller than the visible area of opening @xmath96 .",
    "alternatively , if the burst emission arises from the entire @xmath96 visible area , the burst variability timescale and the assumed grb radius require a @xmath13 larger by a factor 3100 than considered here and a correspondingly larger @xmath74 . ] .",
    "thus , the radius of the scattering outflow can be approximated by that of the grb source , hence the evolution of the scatterer s optical thickness ( @xmath97 ) is _ e 1 = 1 , t_0 1 1 ( ) ^1 1/2 h = 1 ( ) ^1 1/2 [ taut ] for a pair - dominated outflow of kinetic energy @xmath98 .",
    "the product @xmath99 was scaled to @xmath100 , for which the scattered spectrum peaks at 1 gev ( equation [ scnup ] , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 kev ) . by integrating @xmath103 over the evolution given in equation ( [ taut ] )",
    ", it can be shown that the average fraction of scattered photons is @xmath104 , for @xmath105 .",
    "putting together all these factors , the peak flux of the scattered emission ( equation [ fsc ] ) satisfies f_p^(sc ) ( ) ^2 f_p = f_p [ scfp ] the spectrum of the scattered emission above its peak @xmath106 has the same slope as the burst spectrum above @xmath19 , thus @xmath107",
    ". then equations ( [ scnup ] ) and ( [ scfp ] ) for the spectral characteristics of the scattered emission spectrum lead to ( f_)^(sc ) ( ) ^_-1 [ sc ] where @xmath108 is the grb fluence and @xmath109 was used .    in the derivation of equation ( [ sc ] ) , we have considered only scattered photons that move along the observer ",
    "center direction , for which @xmath110 . for incident photons moving along other directions and being scattered toward the observer , the relativistic boost associated with the grb source ",
    "scatterer relative motion is much smaller . in the numerical integration of the scattered emission , we take into account that dependence of relativistic beaming of the incoming grb emission on the angle at which the photon moves ( relative to the radial direction ) , as well as other factors ( e.g. the decrease of the scatterer s optical thickness as it expands , the effect of the source s geometrical curvature on the photon arrival time and energy ) .",
    "the numerical calculation of the scattered grb emission confirms the dependence of the scattered flux on the model parameters given in equation ( [ sc ] ) , sets its normalization and temporal evolution ( figure [ scatter ] ) : ( f_)^(sc ) 1 = 1 10 ^ -9 1 ( 1 1)^1 1 - _ h ( 1 1)^1- 1 1 . [ grbsc ] the above decay of the scattered emission is obtained for a uniform scattering outflow , in which the ejecta mass @xmath111 and lorentz factor @xmath74 are constant .",
    "various decays can be obtained if these quantities vary with the depth @xmath70 in the scattering outflow , e.g. for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the scattered flux above @xmath106 evolves as @xmath114 .",
    "equation ( [ grbsc ] ) indicates that lat will detect the scattered grb emission for ( 1 ) brighter bursts ( @xmath115 ) and/or ( 2 ) afterglows with shorter plateaus ( @xmath92 ks ) .",

    "[ taugrb ]    equations ( [ tausc ] ) and ( [ taugrb ] ) show that gev afterglow photons may be lost to pair - formation on upscattered photons or on burst emission .",

    "the cut - off at @xmath159 is sharp only if the scattering electrons are cold ( @xmath183 ) ; in this case , owing to that @xmath74 is most likely below @xmath100 , the kn effect truncates the scattered spectrum above its peak energy .",
    "we have assessed the ability of four mechanisms related to grbs and their afterglows to produce lat - detectable gev emission during the early afterglow phase ( @xmath184 ks ) .",
    "we note that the expected gev fluxes were calculated from afterglow and grb observables ( x - ray plateau flux , duration , and spectral slope ; burst fluence , duration , and spectral properties ) , keeping to a minimum the use of specific model parameters that are not well determined .    except for the hardest or longest & brightest grbs ,",
    "the large - angle emission released during the burst and arriving later at observer should not be detectable to lat . with the exception of the hardest x - ray afterglows ,",
    "detectable gev emission is not expected from the same emission process that yields the x - ray emission , particularly if the x - ray afterglow is synchrotron emission from the forward shock .",
    "the other two mechanisms discussed rely on the upscattering ( either in the forward - shock or an other part of the relativistic outflow ) of lower energy photons into the gev range and offer better prospects for detection with lat .",
    "the self - compton scattering of forward - shock synchrotron photons is expected to be above lat s 1 ks sensitivity for x - ray afterglows with plateaus brighter than the average .",
    "this mechanism can be identified based on that the spectral slope of the gev emission should be the same as for the x - ray afterglow ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "in addition the decay rates of the fluxes at these two energies should satisfy @xmath186 ( equation [ ic ] ) .",
    "pair - formation may reduce the self - compton scattering flux at 1 gev ( equation [ tauic ] ) if the peak energy of the self - compton emission spectrum is below 100 kev or of the x - ray plateau emission is hard and extends well above 100 kev ( equation [ tausy ] ) .",
    "bulk - scattering of the forward - shock emission by a delayed outflow can explain the x - ray plateaus observed in many swift afterglows if the scattering outflow is pair - rich .",
    "the same mechanism may produce gev emission that lat can detect if the afterglow x - ray emission is brighter and harder than average .",
    "scattering of the burst prompt emission may also produce detectable gev emission , particularly for bursts brighter than average and afterglows with short - lived x - ray plateaus ( equation [ grbsc ] ) .",
    "the upscattered emission should have the same spectral slope as the burst ( @xmath187 ) but can exhibit a variety of decays , depending on the radial distribution of mass and lorentz factor in the scattering outflow .",
    "for this mechanism , pair - formation on either the burst photons or the upscattered emission itself reduces the gev flux above a photon energy that is strongly dependent on the lorentz factors of the grb source and scattering outflow ( equations [ tausc ] and [ taugrb ] ) .",
    "consequently , the detection of photons above 1 gev during the early afterglow can be used to set lower limits on these lorentz factors , similar to how it was done for the grb source lorentz factor using the detection of 0.110 gev photons during the burst by cgro / egret ( e.g. fenimore , epstein & ho 1993 , baring & harding 1997 , lithwick & sari 2001 ) .    for an effective area of 8000 @xmath188",
    ", lat s sensitivity corresponds to several gev photons detected in 1 ks .",
    "thus , for most gev afterglows , the high - energy light - curve will be too crude for a determination of its power - law decay rate . as the spectral slope can be determined with a modest number of collected photons , comparing the slope of the gev spectrum with those of the burst and x - ray afterglow emission",
    "provides a better way to identify the mechanism that produced the high - energy afterglow . for grb 940217 , the only burst for which gev afterglow emission was detected so far , egret observations ( hurley et al 1994 ) show a hard component at 0.14 gev , with @xmath189 during the burst and , possibly , during the afterglow , at 5 ks .",
    "the hardness of the gev emission suggests that it is the burst emission below its spectral peak upscattered by a lagged outflow .",
    "we conclude by noting that , within the framework of the gev afterglow emissions analyzed here , lat will detect high energy photons under favourable conditions .",
    "grbs dimmer or harder than the average and x - ray afterglows with dim and long plateaus could be accompanied by gev emission that is too faint to be detected by lat .",
