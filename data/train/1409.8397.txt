    "solid - liquid separation of strongly flocculated colloidal gels is dictated by the compressive rheology of these materials , where the relevant rheological functions ( compressive yield stress , hydraulic permeability ) govern a wide range of separation processes , from sedimentation and continuous thickening through to centrifugation and pressure filtration .",
    "central to characterization of compressive rheology over a range of solids volume fraction ( @xmath0 ) is the batch settling test , the transient behaviour of which pertains to the hydraulic permeability @xmath1 , whilst equilibrium behaviour is dictated by the compressive yield stress @xmath2 . to extract these rheological functions ,",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) vertical momentum balance is typically used  @xcite to model sedimentation and consolidation of the suspension toward equilibrium , yielding an inverse problem regarding estimation of compressive rheology from experimental data .",
    "whilst several transient hydrodynamic mechanisms compromise the assumption of 1d settling behaviour , including inherent rayleigh - taylor instabilities within the suspension and velocity gradients arising from no - slip wall conditions , at equilibrium the major challenge arises from adhesion between colloidal particles and the container wall .",
    "this attractive force manifests as the wall adhesion ( shear ) strength @xmath3 , which , similar to the bulk shear yield strength , is a strongly increasing function of the solids concentration @xmath0 . as equilibrium data ( either in the form of solids volume fraction profiles or a series of bed heights )",
    "is used to determine the compressive yield stress , which in turn facilitates deconvolution of the hydraulic permeability from transient data , it is of paramount importance that this equilibrium state is modelled correctly .",
    "previous studies of the wall adhesion strength  @xcite showed that for the electrolytically coagulated colloidal suspensions tested , @xmath4 was small in comparison to the compressive yield strength @xmath2 , and so wall adhesion effects in wider columns are negligible , as reflected by the 1d equilibrium momentum balance ( assuming @xmath0 is constant radially ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vertical bed depth ( downwards from the suspension / supernatant interface ) , @xmath7 is the equilibrium solids concentration , @xmath8 the interphase density difference , @xmath9 gravitational acceleration constant , and @xmath10 is the radius of the batch settling column . as the apparent wall adhesion strength @xmath3 typically appears  @xcite to be of the same order as the bulk suspension shear yield strength @xmath11 , and the ratio of shear to compressive yield strength @xmath12 appears to vary over the range 0.001 - 0.2  @xcite , the 1d approximation at equilibrium appears to be generally sound for all but narrow settling columns .",
    "hence wall adhesion effects have been largely ignored over the past half century .",
    "recently , it has been established  @xcite that wall adhesion effects may be much more significant and prevalent than previously appreciated , especially for colloidal suspensions flocculated with high molecular - weight polymer flocculants which exhibit shear / compressive strength ratios of order 0.1 .",
    "these suspensions , along with many coagulated systems , are both strongly cohesive and adhesive , and so readily adhere to settling column walls . for such materials",
    "it has been shown that impractically wide settling columns ( @xmath13 1[m ] ) are required to render wall adhesion effects negligible , whilst for narrower columns , wall adhesion effects can introduce very serious errors in estimates of the compressive yield strength . when wall adhesion effects are significant the particulate network experiences a combination of shear and compressive stresses .",
    "from ( [ eqn:1dbalance ] ) , the wall adhesion stress acts to counteract the interphase gravitational force up to the point that the entire suspension weight can be supported by wall shear stress alone .",
    "this state corresponds to the critical solids concentration @xmath14 @xmath15 which represents an asymptotic limit for the equilibrium solids volume fraction profile @xmath16 . as such , the criterion upon which the relative magnitude of wall adhesion effects should be judged is not simply the ratio @xmath17 , but rather the magnitude of the wall adhesion strength @xmath3 with respect to the wall shear stress @xmath18 , where over a range of @xmath0 the former term must be much smaller than the latter for the 1d approximation to hold .",
    "hence wall adhesion effects can be highly significant for both polymer flocculated and electrolytically coagulated strong colloidal gels , and for other types of gel when the particle size is small , especially in the nano - scale range , since the strength ratio @xmath17 is expected to increase with decreasing particle size .",
    "in general is it almost impossible to detect the presence or magnitude of wall adhesion errors from the equilibrium solids volume fraction profile alone .",
    "the only clear - cut case is that where the asymptotic limit @xmath19 is approached , and in this case errors arising from wall adhesion effects are unbounded as the corresponding predicted compressive yield stress diverges . as such , there is a clear and direct need to develop methods to detect and correct for wall adhesion effects in equilibrium batch settling data .    in a previous study @xcite we developed and validated a mathematical model of the suspension equilibrium stress state in the presence of wall adhesion , and developed error estimates for the uncorrected compressive yield strength .",
    "analysis of the governing multidimensional force balance and suspension behaviour under arbitrary tensorial loadings raised fundamental questions regarding the constitutive modeling of strongly flocculated colloidal suspensions , particularly the relative validity and utility of both visco - plastic and visco - elastic rheological models for strong colloidal gels .",
    "a solution method was developed based upon the 2d static problem relating to the equilibrium stress balance which facilitated accurate estimates of the compressive and shear yield strengths from equilibrium solids volume fraction profiles .",
    "whilst successful , this method is somewhat unwieldy in that it involves iterated numerical solution of the governing hyper - elastic constitutive model which is both computationally intensive and algorithmically complex .",
    "what is required is a more simple and robust means of accurately estimating the compressive and shear yield strengths from equilibrium batch settling data , such that analysis of experimental data can be performed routinely . in this paper",
    "we develop such a method using a highly simplified 1d analytic solution for the equilibrium solids concentration profile based upon a visco - plastic constitutive model .",
    "the validity of this approximate solution is tested and justified against both the full hyper - elastic solution and experimental data , and methods for estimation of the compressive rheological functions from either solids volume fraction profile data or multiple equilibrium height data are developed and tested .",
    "in the following section we briefly review the equations governing multi - dimensional batch settling along with the visco - elastic and visco - plastic constitutive models for the the rheology of strong colloidal gels . in section [ sec:1dapprox ]",
    "we develop and validate a simplified 1d model based on the visco - plastic constitutive model , and in section [ sec : volfrac ] this model is applied to equilibrium solids volume fraction profile data to validate the method .",
    "this method is then extended to equilibrium height data in section [ sec : eqmheight ] , and a sensitivity analysis is performed on this method prior to conclusions being made in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "prior to the development of simplified models for solution of the equilibrium batch settling problem in section 3 , we briefly review governing equations and constitutive approaches .",
    "although this study is focussed on the batch settling experiment under equilibrium conditions , the integral hyper - elastic constitutive model is couched in terms of the deformation history of the suspension , and so this model requires evolution of the initial condition @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the suspension gel point ) to the equilibrium state . under the assumption that during sedimentation the bulk suspension velocity @xmath22 is zero ( where @xmath23 , @xmath24 respectively are the solid and fluid phase velocities ) , the inter - phase force balance over the particulate network  @xcite simplifies to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the network stress tensor , defined  @xcite as the difference between the total suspension stress @xmath27 and the fluid stress @xmath28 : @xmath29 at long times the batch settling transient solution ( [ eqn : simpleevoln ] ) converges to the equilibrium state @xmath7 , where the solid and fluid fluxes decay to zero , yielding a balance between the network stress gradient and gravitational force as @xmath30 given appropriate boundary conditions , this equation is capable of describing the batch settling experiment under equilibrium conditions in the presence of wall adhesion effects . to close both the transient ( [ eqn : simpleevoln ] ) and equilibrium ( [ eqn : eqmbalance ] ) equations , an appropriate constitutive model for strong colloidal gels",
    "is required for the network stress tensor @xmath31 .",
    "strong colloidal gels are mostly commonly modelled as visco - plastic materials ( such as bingham or herschel - bulkley models ) as they are generally brittle in shear , with typical yield strains of the order 0.01 - 1% . for the present purposes",
    ", the yield strain can be taken to mean the apparent yield strain , given by the ratio of yield stress to linear shear modulus .",
    "similarly , compression is modelled as a self - limiting visco - plastic process in terms of the compressive yield stress @xmath2 .",
    "whilst these idealized models only capture the gross rheology , they are simple and tractable , and allow the suspension network pressure @xmath32 and deviatoric stress @xmath33 to be quantified directly in terms of the compressive and shear yield strengths as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the material derivative with respect to the solid phase , where @xmath36 is the 2nd invariant of @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the apparent suspension viscosity ( which is typically non - newtonian ) , and @xmath39 is the rate of shear strain .",
    "however , as recent studies  @xcite have established , the true nature of yield of these materials is more somewhat more complicated than is captured by visco - plastic constitutive models , and rather strong colloidal gels act as visco - elastic materials which undergo rapid strain hardening in compression and can undergo rapid strain softening and/or hardening in shear . as such",
    ", a more consistent and accurate way to describe strong colloidal gels is as visco - elastic media with strongly nonlinear shear modulus @xmath40 and bulk modulus @xmath41 . under this hyper - elastic formulation ,",
    "the network pressure @xmath32 and deviatoric stress @xmath37 are given by the integral evolution equations  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the deviatoric component of the hencky strain tensor @xmath44 for the solid phase .",
    "due to the integral nature of the hyper - elastic constitutive model , the initial state @xmath45 must be evolved via the transient equation ( [ eqn : simpleevoln ] ) toward the equilibrium state @xmath46 .",
    "conversely , the visco - plastic model does not require the full deformation history , and so acts directly on the equilibrium force balance ( [ eqn : eqmbalance ] ) .",
    "hence the visco - plastic constitutive model represents an simplified approximation to the full hyper - elastic constitutive model which is less computationally intensive , but it also suffers from the drawback that the stress - strain relationship is ill - defined prior to yield . in the case of multi - dimensional batch settling , this corresponds to a statically indeterminate equilibrium stress state which requires special treatment to resolve .      to resolve this statically indeterminate state , the assumption of negligible normal stress differences @xmath47 was invoked  @xcite to close the equilibrium stress state , and it was found that under this closure the visco - plastic solution closely approximates the full hyperelastic solution . whilst this closure may not be appropriate in general , i.e. strong colloidal gels may exhibit significant normal stress differences in other applications , these materials under static equilibrium do not exhibit such effects . in conjunction with this closure ,",
    "the assumption of axisymmetry within a cylindrical batch settling column simplifies the network stress tensor to @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the isotropic and deviatoric network stresses respectively . under these simplifications , and ignoring the angular components @xmath51 , the equilibrium network force balance reduces to @xmath52 which applies over the suspension domain @xmath53\\times[0,h_\\infty)$ ] , where @xmath54 is the equilibrium suspension height . if the initial solids volume fraction @xmath55 is less than the suspension gel point @xmath21 , then at equilibrium the network pressure @xmath32 is everywhere equal to the compressive yield strength @xmath56 the hyperbolic system ( [ eqn : radial ] ) , ( [ eqn : vertical ] ) is also subject to the boundary conditions @xmath57 where the critical boundary condition ( [ eqn : shearrr ] ) may be recast via ( [ eqn : phyphi ] ) as @xmath58 and the function @xmath59 reflects the relationship between the compressive yield strength @xmath2 and shear yield strength @xmath11 at a given volume fraction @xmath0 .",
    "based upon physical arguments and experimental data , @xcite proposes a relationship for the ratio @xmath60 between the shear and compressive yield strength of a particulate gel , which rapidly decreases from around 1 near the gel point @xmath21 to the asymptotic value @xmath61 with increasing @xmath0 . for a compressive yield strength function of the form",
    "@xmath62 the asymptotic value is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the critical shear strain and @xmath65 the ratio of shear to compressive moduli , which is related to the the poisson ratio @xmath66 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 for systems bound by central forces as per cauchy s relationships . for a compressive yield strength with the functional form ( [ eqn : pyphi_func ] ) , @xmath17 is then @xmath70 and @xmath59 in the wall boundary condition ( [ eqn : shearrr ] ) simplifies to @xmath71    the hyperbolic system ( [ eqn : radial ] ) ( [ eqn : vertical ] ) manifests as a pair of characteristics which propagate down the bed at approximately 45 degrees to the container wall and are reflected off the container wall and symmetry axis as per the reflection conditions ( [ eqn : shearr0 ] ) , ( [ eqn : shearrr ] ) . in terms of the shear stress distribution ,",
    "these characteristics manifest as @xmath72 shocks ( i.e. non lifshitz - continuous ) in the shear stress distribution , as shown in fig  [ fig : viscoplastic](a ) , which are clearly non - physical .",
    "these artifacts are a direct result of the hyperbolic nature of the visco - plastic constitutive model , and call into question its validity for multi - dimensional static problems .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     often the suspension gel point @xmath21 has been obtained by other means , which constrains the parameter estimation problem .",
    "such information resolves the deconvolution problem between @xmath21 and @xmath73 , and significantly improves the accuracy of all parameter estimates .",
    "whilst in principle the gel point can be estimated from equilibrium height data , estimates of @xmath21 from the column data given tend to over - estimate the gel - point , rather smaller values of @xmath74 are required to extrapolate toward the zero - pressure case . the estimates for when @xmath21 is known are shown in table  [ tab : error2 ] , and the relative errors",
    "are significantly reduced , less than 2.5% for the 0.5[mm ] error and 1% for the 0.2[mm ] error levels .",
    "these results in fig .",
    "[ fig : py_errors2 ] suggest that it is possible to quite accurately estimate the compressive yield strength from equilibrium height data given careful experimentation and prior knowledge of the suspension gel point .",
    "wall adhesion effects in equilibrium batch settling tests have been shown to be more prevalent than previously thought for strongly flocculated colloidal gels , and such artifacts can lead to unbounded errors in estimation of the compressive rheology of these materials .",
    "indeed , wall effects are always likely to be important in gravity batch settling for two reasons , firstly , the effect of shear relative to compressive strength is amplified by a geometric factor of @xmath75 , and second , the suspension is usually not far from the gel - point where the ratio @xmath17 of shear ( adhesive ) to compressive strength is unity , regardless of how small its asymptotic value @xmath61 is at high volume - fraction . in this study , we develop and test a 1d approximate solution to the equilibrium stress state which represents a significant simplification of previous multi - dimensional solution methods using either visco - plastic or hyper - elastic constitutive models .",
    "the 1d visco - plastic analytic solution provides accurate estimates ( within several percent ) of both the 2d visco - plastic and hyper - elastic solutions , and so is suitable for direct estimation of both the compressive @xmath2 and shear @xmath11 yield strength from equilibrium batch settling data via nonlinear regression .",
    "methods have been developed to estimate the shear and compressive rheology from either several equilibrium solids volume fraction profiles in different width settling columns , or a series of equilibrium height measurements over a combination of total solids and column radii .",
    "for equilibrium solids concentration profile data , accurate estimates of both @xmath2 and @xmath11 are possible , given the local cross - sectionally average equilibrium solids volume fraction @xmath76 can be measured accurately , however there does exist an outstanding issue with respect to deconvolution of the parameter group @xmath77 .",
    "in essence , this issue means that whilst accurate estimates of the compressive and shear yield stress curves can be gained , the individual parameters @xmath73 and @xmath21 are less accurately estimated . in the case of equilibrium height data @xmath54 ,",
    "it is necessary to undertake a significant number of tests under variable column height and radii to provide a dense enough dataset for accurate estimation .",
    "prior knowledge of the suspension gel point @xmath21 and accurate measurement of @xmath54 are required to generate accurate estimates of the shear and compressive rheology .",
    "these results indicate that wall adhesion effects can be routinely corrected for in equilibrium batch settling tests , yielding accurate estimates of the shear and compressive rheology of strong colloidal gels .",
    "the important case of centrifugal batch settling will be considered in a subsequent paper wherein it will be shown that the errors due to adhesion are normally much less significant , in part because then most of the gel is not near the gel - point and second because @xmath78 decreases with increasing acceleration .",
