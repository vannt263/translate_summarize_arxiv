    "bit commitment involves two mistrustful parties  alice and bob  of which alice submits to bob a piece of evidence that he will use to confirm a bit value that she will later reveal , whereas bob can not determine the bit value from the evidence alone",
    ". a good bit commitment protocol should be simultaneously _ concealing _ and _ binding _ , namely the evidence should be submitted to bob in such a way that he has ( almost ) no chance to identify the committed bit value before alice later decodes it for him , whereas alice has ( almost ) no way of changing the value of the committed bit once she has submitted the evidence . in the easiest example to illustrate bit commitment",
    ", alice writes the bit down on a piece of paper , which is then locked in a safe and sent to bob , whereas alice keeps the key . at a later time , she will unveil the bit by handing over the key to bob",
    ". however , bob may be able to open the safe in the meantime , and this scheme is in principle insecure . yet all bit commitment schemes currently used rely on strongboxes and keys made of computations that are ( supposedly ) hard to perform ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of references ) , and cryptographers have long known that bit commitment ( like any other interesting two - party cryptographic primitive ) can not be securely implemented with classical information @xcite .",
    "besides having immediate practical applications , bit commitment is also a very powerful cryptographic primitive",
    ". conceived by blum @xcite as a building block for secure coin tossing , it also allows to implement secure oblivious transfer @xcite , which , in turn , is sufficient to establish secure two - party computation @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been a long - time challenge for quantum cryptographers to find _ unconditionally secure _ quantum bit commitment protocols , in which  very much in parallel to quantum key distribution @xcite  security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics alone .",
    "the first quantum bit commitment protocol appeared in the famous bennett and brassard 1984 quantum cryptography paper @xcite , in a version for implementing coin tossing .",
    "however , they also proved that alice can cheat using epr correlations , by which she can unveil either bit at the opening stage by measuring in the appropriate basis a particle entangled with the one encoding the bit , whereas bob has no way to detect the attack .",
    "subsequent proposals for bit commitment schemes tried to evade this type of attack , _",
    "e.g. _ in the protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite which for a while was generally accepted to be unconditionally secure .    in 1996",
    "lo and chau @xcite , and mayers @xcite realized that all previously proposed bit commitment protocols were vulnerable to a generalized version of the epr attack that renders the bb84 proposal insecure , a result that they slightly extended to cover quantum bit commitment protocols in general .",
    "their basic argument is the following . at the end of the commitment phase",
    ", bob will hold one out of two quantum states @xmath1 as proof of alice s commitment to the bit value @xmath2 .",
    "alice holds its purification @xmath3 , which she will later pass on to bob to unveil . for the protocol to",
    "be concealing , the two states @xmath1 should be ( almost ) indistinguishable , @xmath4 .",
    "but uhlmann s theorem @xcite then implies the existence of a unitary transformation @xmath5 that ( nearly ) rotates the purification of @xmath6 into the purification of @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath5 is localized on the purifying system only , which is entirely under alice s control , lo - chau - mayers argue that alice can switch at will between the two states , and is not in any way bound to her commitment . as a consequence",
    ", any concealing bit commitment protocol is argued to be necessarily non - binding ( these results still hold true when both parties are restricted by superselection rules @xcite ) .",
    "so while the proposed quantum bit commitment protocols offer good practical security on the grounds that alice s epr attack is hard to perform with current technology , none of them is unconditionally secure .    starting from 2000 the lo - chau - mayers no - go",
    "theorem @xcite has been continually challenged by yuen and others @xcite , arguing that the impossibility proof of ref .",
    "@xcite does not exhaust all conceivable quantum bit commitment protocols , whereas it is still unclear if mayer s framework @xcite is complete .",
    "several protocols have been proposed and claimed to circumvent the no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "these protocols seek to strengthen bob s position with the help of ` secret parameters ' or ` anonymous states ' , so that alice lacks some information needed to cheat successfully : while uhlmann s theorem would still imply the existence of a unitary cheating transformation as described above , this transformation might be unknown to alice .",
    "the above attempts to build up a secure quantum bit commitment protocol have motivated the thorough analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , which provided a strengthened and explicit impossibility proof exhausting all conceivable protocols in which classical and quantum information is exchanged between two parties , including the possibility of protocol aborts and resets .",
    "the proof @xcite encompasses protocols even with unbounded number of communication rounds ( it is only required that the expected number of rounds is finite ) , and with quantum systems on infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces . however , the considerable length of the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite makes it still hard to follow ( see _ e.g. _ comments in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , lacking a synthetic intuition of the impossibility proof .",
    "the debate can be only settled with an appropriate formulation of the problem , which is sufficiently powerful to include all possible protocols in a single simple mathematical object , thus leaving no shadow of doubt on the completeness of the protocol classification .",
    "once the mathematical formulation of all protocols is settled , then the impossibility statement becomes just a mathematical theorem .",
    "in this paper we will first see that the appropriate notion to describe all individual strategies in a purely quantum protocol is the _",
    "quantum comb_. the quantum comb generalizes the notion of quantum operation of kraus @xcite , and has been originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe quantum _ circuit boards _ , where inputs and outputs are not just quantum states , but quantum operations themselves .",
    "since quantum combs are in one - to - one correspondence with sequences of quantum operations @xcite , a quantum comb is suited to represent the sequence of moves performed by a party in a multi - round quantum protocol .",
    "indeed , the same mathematical structure of quantum combs has been recognized by gutoski and watrous in ref .",
    "@xcite as the appropriate formulation of multi - round quantum games .",
    "in order to treat protocols that involve both quantum and classical communication , we will then extend this framework by introducing the concept of _ conditional comb _ , which describes a computing network that is able to sequentially process both quantum and classical information .",
    "examples of combs are represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ f : qcombs ] . for a purely quantum comb",
    ", each line entering or exiting a tooth of the comb represents a quantum system . for a conditional comb ,",
    "each line represents a hybrid quantum - classical system , accounting also for classical information exchanged at each step . in a two - party protocol ,",
    "a comb represents a single - party strategy , with each tooth of the comb representing the move performed by the party at some turn .",
    "subsequent turns are represented by subsequent teeth , from left to right .",
    "the output oft the multi - round protocol is given by two combs interlaced as in fig .",
    "[ f : interlacedqcombs]the upper bob s , the lower alice s .",
    "the exchange of quantum - classical systems can be mathematically described in a c@xmath0-algebraic representation of a deterministic comb , or , equivalently , by treating the conditional comb as a collection of ( purely quantum ) probabilistic combs , each of them being labeled by a particular history of classical communication . in this paper , we will choose the second point of view , which avoids using the c@xmath0-algebraic framework , with the need , however , of considering collections of probabilistic quantum combs , accounting for the classical information coming from measurements .",
    "a protocol assigns the set of allowed strategies , i.e. the set of allowed conditional combs , along with the pertaining input - output structure regulating the exchange of quantum and classical information .",
    "as already mentioned , a conditional comb is a collection of probabilistic quantum combs , each of them representing the sequence of single - party moves associated to a particular history of classical communication . in a general protocol",
    ", some histories will lead to a successful commitment , while some other will possibly lead to an _ abort _ , in which the two parties irrevocably give up , excluding any further communication ( if the protocol is restarted , then the concatenation of the two sequences can be regarded as part of a new longer protocol with possible _ resets _ ) .",
    "accordingly , we will consider histories from the beginning to the end of the commitment ( which can be either successful or not ) , _",
    "i.e _ excluding the opening .",
    "each tooth of a comb corresponds to a single turn of the protocol , and , in the case of successful commitment , the last tooth represents the last turn before the opening .    for histories that end in a successful commitment , in the opening alice will send to bob a classical message along with a set of ancillae prescribed by the protocol , and bob",
    "will perform a suitable joint measurement on all quantum systems available to him , as in fig .",
    "[ f : interlacedqcombs ] .",
    "the combination of bob s comb ( up to the opening ) with the final measurement at the opening is itself a special case of quantum comb ",
    "the so - called _ quantum tester_whose output is the committed bit value . in this framework",
    ", alice s comb plays the role of a `` state '' encoding the bit value , whereas bob s tester plays the role of a `` povm '' for binary discrimination . such binary discrimination  prescribed by the protocol at its end  should not be confused with bob s attempts to discriminate alice s strategies before the opening .",
    "we will see that the fact that the protocol has many rounds actually can help bob in discriminating between different alice s strategies .",
    "thus , the probability of bob cheating  which in a protocol with a single bob - alice - bob round would be represented by the cb - norm distance between alice s channels  here is replaced by the _",
    "comb distance_@xcite , which is typically larger than the cb - norm , since bob can exploit the memory structure of alice s strategy .    in the following",
    "we will consider the concealment - bindingness tradeoff for any possible history of classical information exchanged within the protocol .",
    "this will allow us to restate the tradeoff in terms of a mathematical theorem assessing the continuity of dilations of probabilistic quantum combs in terms of the comb discriminability - distance .",
    "the dilation theorem states that any probabilistic comb can be dilated to a sequence of single - kraus quantum operations , upon introducing some additional ancillae . as a consequence ,",
    "the impossibility proof will run essentially as follows . at the end of the commitment phase , two possible alice s strategies for the bit values 0 and 1 , respectively , are ( almost ) indistinguishable to bob , who lacks the quantum information encoded in alice s ancillae .",
    "instead , at the opening , the two dilated strategies of alice corresponding to the two values of the committed bit are ( almost ) perfectly discriminable .",
    "as a consequence of indstinguishability up to the opening phase , alice can choose between the two strategies by performing a unitary transformation on the ancilla in the last tooth of her comb .",
    "therefore , one has ( almost ) perfect opening , and , at the same time , alice can cheat perfectly .",
    "the concealment - bindingness tradeoff is thus reduced to the continuity of the dilation of probabilistic combs in terms of their discriminability - distance . in the present paper",
    "we will restrict to finite - dimensional protocols , with finite - number of rounds .",
    "the last assumption does not introduce any practical limitation , since , in the real world one needs to put a bound anyway to the lapse of time needed for the commitment .",
    "we will anyway discuss also protocols with unbounded number of rounds in the concluding section .    before starting the main sections of the paper ,",
    "we compare here the present approach with that of the previous impossibility proof in ref .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite treats the strategies as the preparation of a quantum register , and classical and quantum communications are described in the heisenberg picture in the unified framework of c@xmath0-algebras . in the present approach the c@xmath0-algebraic framework",
    "is avoided , by treating classical histories as labels for sequences of quantum operations in the schrdinger picture , and strategies are identified with conditional quantum combs , which provide a direct mathematical formulation . at this level ,",
    "the differences are only in the mathematical language , but two approaches are substantially equivalent .",
    "there are , however , conceptual differences , in which the two approaches sensibly differ .",
    "the most relevant difference is the notion of security , which in the present treatment is taken at the strongest level , _",
    "i.e. _ worst - case over all classical histories , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite security was defined in average .",
    "the present security notion is cryptographically the strongest , corresponding to a priceless commitment bit .",
    "another important difference between the present approach and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is a more general impossibility proof , in which one can restrict the set of possible bob s operations to a set closed under dilations . in other words , we assume that bob is able to keep pure his quantum information and to perform arbitrary quantum operations on his ancillae , whereas his operations on the quantum systems exchanged during the commitment can be restricted by arbitrary constraints .",
    "this makes the impossibility proof more general , including _",
    "e.g. _ the case of a bob constrained by a checking alice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : proto ] we review the definition and the main features of a quantum protocol for bit commitment , and define what a successful bit commitment protocol would have to achieve . in section [ s : qcombs ]",
    "we will briefly recall the prerequisites about quantum combs , including the notion of quantum tester , the discriminability - distance , the dilation of combs , and the notion of conditional comb .",
    "the most important result of the section is the dilation theorem for quantum combs , along with a continuity theorem in terms of the discriminability - distance . in section [ s : mathform ]",
    "we present the mathematical formulation of bit commitment in terms of quantum combs , and state the impossibility proof for protocols with bounded and unbounded number of rounds of communication .",
    "the analysis will be based solely on the principles of quantum mechanics , including classical physics , but not including relativistic constraints , which are known to facilitate secure bit commitment @xcite .",
    "section [ s : conc ] concludes the paper with some comments on the main results .",
    "a protocol regulates the exchange of messages between participants , defining what are the honest strategies that they can adopt , so that at every stage it is clear what type of message is expected from the participants , although , of course , their content is not fixed .",
    "the expected message types can be either classical or quantum or a combination thereof . the number of classical states and the dimension of the hilbert spaces at a given step can depend on the previously generated classical information .      in any bit commitment protocol , we can distinguish two main phases .",
    "the first is the _ commitment phase _ , in which alice and bob exchange classical and quantum messages in order to commit the bit .",
    "eventually , this phase can end either with a successful commitment , or with an abort , in which the two parties irrevocably give up the purpose of committing the bit ( of course , in a well - designed protocol , if both parties are honest the probability of abort should be vanishingly small ) .",
    "if no abort took place , the bit value is considered to be committed to bob but , supposedly , concealed from him . since bit commitment is a two - party protocol and trusted third parties are not allowed , the starting state necessarily has to be originated by one of the two parties ( see also fig . [",
    "f : third_party ] ) .    moreover , since we can always include in the protocol null steps ( in which no information , classical or quantum , is exchanged ) , without loss of generality , we can restrict our attention to protocols that are started by bob .",
    "the second phase is the _",
    "opening phase_. in the case of abort during the commitment , this is just a null step , whereas , in the case of successful commitment , at the opening alice will send to bob some classical or quantum information in order to to reveal the bit value . taking both alice s message and his own ( classical and quantum ) records , bob",
    "will then perform a suitable _ verification measurement_. his measurement will result in either a successful readout of the committed bit , or in a failure , _",
    "e.g. _ due to the detection of an attempted cheat .",
    "again , in a well - designed protocol the probability of failure should be vanishingly small .",
    "in the following we will denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 two honest strategies corresponding to the two bit values 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "we call a protocol @xmath10-_concealing _ if , conditionally on any history of classical communication , bob can not distinguish between the strategies @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( up to an error @xmath10 ) before alice opens the commitment . in general",
    ", of course , the probability of a given history of classical communication depends on whether alice chooses @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "since this dependence can be exploited by bob to infer the bit value , we must require that , no matter what strategy @xmath11 bob uses , the conditional probability of @xmath8 given history @xmath12 never differs from the probability of @xmath9 given history @xmath12 by more than @xmath10 .",
    "note that this requirement must by satisfied even by histories that end up in an abort , otherwise , by the sole fact that the protocol aborted bob could reliably infer the value of the bit .",
    "we say that an alice s strategy @xmath13 is _",
    "@xmath14-close _ to @xmath15 if , conditionally on any history of classical communication , bob can not distinguish @xmath15 from @xmath13 ( up to an error @xmath14 ) at any time , including the opening phase .",
    "given two honest strategies @xmath8 and @xmath9 , a _ @xmath14-cheating _ is a pair of strategies @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with the properties that _",
    "i ) _ @xmath18 is @xmath14-close to @xmath19 for @xmath20 and _ ii ) _ alice can turn @xmath16 into @xmath17 with a local operation on her ancillae after the end of the commitment phase . in other words , the strategies @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the same throughout the commitment phase , and differ only by a local operation carried out before the opening .",
    "if no @xmath14-cheating strategy exists for alice , we call the protocol _ @xmath14-binding_.",

    "alice s ( bob s ) strategies are still described by collections of probabilistic combs @xmath329 and ( @xmath389 ) , where each probabilistic comb represents the sequence of quantum operations performed by alice ( bob ) for a given history @xmath12 of classical communication .",
    "note that , although the length the strings is no longer bounded by a fixed number , any given string @xmath12 must have finite length .",
    "indeed , a protocol allowing an infinitely long history @xmath12 would be a protocol in which sometimes alice and bob have to continue their communication forever , without reaching neither a successful commitment , nor an abort .    for a protocol with unbounded number of rounds ,",
    "the conditions of @xmath10-concealment and @xmath14-closeness are still given by eqs .",
    "( [ conce ] ) and ( [ cheat ] ) , respectively .",
    "now , it is immediate to see that , given an @xmath10-concealing protocol with unbounded number of rounds , one can always construct a new @xmath10-concealing protocol with bounded number .",
    "indeed , alice can follow the original unbounded protocol , and decide to abort whenever the number of rounds exceeds a fixed number @xmath44 .",
    "this change does not change the security of the protocol : it just reduces the probability of successful commitment by turning some histories that in the original protocol ended in a successful commitment into histories that end in an abort . for the new protocol with finite rounds ,",
    "however , one can apply theorem [ theo : impossibility ] , thus finding a @xmath357-cheating for alice .",
    "since @xmath44 is arbitrary and since for any @xmath44 the cheating strategy coincides with the honest one up to the opening , alice can take the number @xmath44 to be sufficiently large to make the probability of successful commitment close to the one of the unbounded original protocol .",
    "in this paper we have provided a new short impossibility proof of quantum bit commitment .",
    "the present proof differs from the previous ones in the following main aspects : _ a ) _ the strategies , including all their `` purifications '' , have a simple and univocal mathematical representation in terms of conditional quantum combs in eq .",
    "( [ e : truegame ] ) ; _ b ) _ the definition of concealment and bindingness are worst - case over histories , namely the conditions on cheating probabilities are defined uniformly over histories of classical communication rather than on average ; _ c ) _ we consider the possibility of restricting the strategies of bob to an arbitrary set closed under dilation , and show that if the protocol is concealing for bob restricted in this way , then it is not binding .",
    "along similar lines it is possible to prove the impossibility theorem also with cheating probabilities averaged over histories .",
    "however , the two impossibility theorems are not comparable , since worst - case concealment implies concealment in average , whereas bindingness in average implies worst - case bindingness .    at the end of the paper",
    ", we want to stress two points regarding abortion probabilities .",
    "first , concealment is defined regardless abortion , namely bob must not be able to detect the bit value anyway , whether alice catches him or not .",
    "second , in order to cheat alice has only to play the honest strategy @xmath313 up to the very last moment before the opening , at which point her cheat is anyway undetectable by bob ( at the opening bob s success probability in detecting the cheat is at most @xmath390-close to the success probability of a random guess ) .",
