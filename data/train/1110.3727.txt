    "@xmath0 is an on - axis neutrino - nucleus scattering experiment at fermilab s numi ( neutrinos at the main injector ) beamline that will measure interaction cross - sections and event kinematics in exclusive and inclusive states to high precision .",
    "the experiment will also examine nuclear effects and parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) using a variety of targets materials .",
    "interaction details are crucial for neutrino energy estimation and in background separation in oscillation experiments . for example , in a @xmath2 disappearance experiment , the two - flavor disappearance relation is show in eq .",
    "[ eq : numudisp ] : @xmath3 experiments can not directly measure the neutrino energy that appears in this relation , and visible energy is a function of flux , cross - section , and detector response .",
    "interactions occur in dense nuclear matter , making final state interactions ( fsi ) significant in producing the observed particles .",
    "near - to - far detector ratios can not entirely eliminate the associated uncertainties because the energy spectra at the two detectors are different due to beam , oscillation , matter , and even nuclear effects if the detector materials differ .",

    "understanding these effects is especially important in light of recent `` hints '' of a large @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "as figure [ fig : nunubarasym ] illustrates , for a fixed value of the cp violating phase , @xmath6 , the @xmath1-@xmath7 oscillation asymmetries are smaller at larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , for larger values of @xmath5 , experiments are measuring a smaller difference between two larger numbers and systematic errors increase in relative importance . in this case , @xmath0 cross - section and kinematic measurements increase in value .",
    "additionally , @xmath0 supports a nuclear effects program complementary to charged lepton scattering measurements .",
    "many quantities of interest carry large uncertainties : axial form factors as a function of a and momentum transfer ( @xmath8 ) , quark - hadron duality , @xmath9-dependent nuclear effects , etc .",
    "@xmath0 is a horizontal stack of 120 similar modules weighing approximately two tons each .",
    "each module has an inner detector ( i d ) composed of triangular plastic scintillator strips and an outer detector ( od ) steel frame instrumented with plastic scintillator bars .",
    "most modules feature an i d composed of two stereoscopic planes of scintillator , but some in the nuclear target and calorimetric regions of the detector give up one or both scintillator planes for target or absorber materials .",
