    "the past decade has seen an overwhelming amount of exciting heavy flavour physics results  @xcite from the @xmath1  @xmath2  factory experiments babar and belle as well as the cdf and d0  experiments operating at the tevatron @xmath3  collider . in many cases ,",
    "the measurements performed at the tevatron collider are complementary to those at the @xmath2  factories .",
    "in particular , all @xmath2  hadron states are produced at the tevatron . besides the neutral @xmath4 and the charged @xmath5 which are the only products at the @xmath6  resonance , the tevatron is also a source of @xmath2  mesons containing @xmath7- or @xmath8-quark :  and @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , baryons containing bottom quarks such as the , , @xmath10 or  baryons are produced at the tevatron .",
    "why do we study @xmath2  hadron states ?",
    "in analogy to the hydrogen atom which consists of a heavy nucleus in form of the proton surrounded by a light electron , a @xmath2  hadron consists of a heavy bottom quark surrounded either by a light anti - quark , to form a @xmath2  meson or a di - quark pair , to form a bottom baryon .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath11  quark and the other quark(s ) in a @xmath2  hadron is based on the strong interaction or quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) while the interaction between proton and electron is based on the electromagnetic coulomb interaction and described by quantum electrodynamics in its ultimate form .",
    "heavy quark hadrons are often called the hydrogen atom of qcd .",
    "the study of @xmath2  hadron states is thus the study of ( non - perturbative ) qcd , providing sensitive tests of all aspects of qcd , including lattice gauge calculations .",
    "in addition , the study of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism which governs quark transitions allows for precision tests of the standard model ( sm ) and the search for physics beyond the sm through measurements of loop processes in which non - sm particles can contribute .    after a successful 1992 - 1996 runi data taking period ( for a review of @xmath2  physics results from e.g.  cdf in runi see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the fermilab tevatron operates in runii at a centre - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev with a bunch crossing time of 396  ns generated by @xmath12 @xmath3 bunches .",
    "the initial tevatron luminosity steadily increased from 2002 to 2009 with a present peak luminosity of @xmath13  @xmath14s@xmath15 reached in 2009 .",
    "the total integrated luminosity delivered by the tevatron to cdf and d0 at the time of this conference is @xmath16  fb@xmath15 with about @xmath17  fb@xmath15 recorded to tape by each collider experiment .",
    "however , most results presented in this review use about 1 - 4  fb@xmath15 of data .",
    "in the neutral  system there exist two flavour eigenstates , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the mass eigenstates  and  are admixtures of the flavour eigenstates  and : @xmath20 the fact that the mass eigenstates are not the same as the flavour states gives rise to oscillations between the  and  states with a frequency proportional to the mass difference of the mass eigenstates , @xmath21 . in the sm particle - antiparticle oscillations",
    "are explained in terms of second - order weak processes involving virtual massive particles that provide a transition amplitude between the and  states .",
    "the decay width difference between the mass eigenstates @xmath22 is related to the @xmath0  phase @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the off - diagonal elements of the mass and decay matrix .",
    "the decay  is the transition of the spin-0 pseudo - scalar into two spin-1 vector particles .",
    "the orbital angular momenta of the vector mesons , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , can be used to distinguish the @xmath0  even @xmath28-wave ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30-wave ( @xmath31 ) final states from the @xmath0  odd @xmath32-wave ( @xmath33 ) final state .",
    "such an angular decomposition reveals that the decay is dominated by the @xmath0  even state .      in analogy to measurements of the time dependent @xmath0  asymmetry in",
    "neutral  decays into e.g.  @xmath34 accessing the @xmath0 violating phase @xmath35 which arises through the interference between decay and mixing , the application of flavour tagging to  events measures the corresponding phase in  decays .",
    "this phase , which is responsible for @xmath0  violation in  in the standard model , is in analogy to the phase @xmath35 called @xmath36 and is defined through the ckm matrix elements as @xmath37 . in the context of the sm , this phase is expected to be small ( @xmath38 ) and its measurement is currently beyond the experimental reach of the tevatron .",
    "however , new physics may contribute significantly larger values to the @xmath0  violating phase in  decays  @xcite . in this case , the observed @xmath0  phase would be modified by a phase  due to new physics processes , and can be expressed as @xmath39 .",
    "the current interest in measuring @xmath0  violation in  is therefore in searching for enhanced @xmath0  violation through new physics processes .    at the time of this conference , both tevatron experiments have presented tagged",
    ", time dependent angular analyses of  decays . due to the non - parabolic behaviour of the log - likelihood function ,",
    "no meaningful point estimates for  can be quoted and both experiments construct their results as confidence level regions in the plane of  versus .",
    "the d0 result  @xcite based on 2.8  fb@xmath15 of data is shown in figure  [ fig : bscontour](a ) while a published result from cdf based on 1.35  fb@xmath15 of data  @xcite exists .",
    "a preliminary update from cdf with 2.8  fb@xmath15 of data is displayed in figure  [ fig : bscontour](b ) .",
    "both experiments observe a mild inconsistency with the sm prediction @xmath38 .",
    "interestingly , the cdf and d0 inconsistencies with the standard model both point in the same direction . assuming the sm prediction ,",
    "cdf quotes a probability of 7% to observe a likelihood ratio equal or higher than the one observed in data which corresponds to about @xmath40 . using constraints on the strong phases ,",

    "the @xmath45  baryon states with quark content @xmath46 and @xmath47 have been discovered by cdf  @xcite in 2007 through their strong decay @xmath48 using fully reconstructed @xmath49 candidates .",
