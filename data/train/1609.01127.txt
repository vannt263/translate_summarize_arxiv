    "systems interacting with a thermal reservoir are frequently used in descriptions of a variety of physical phenomena . for such systems ,",
    "the reservoir plays roles not only to keep systems in an equilibrium state , but also to make systems relaxed to an equilibrium state , and even to cause nonequilibrium steady states by interactions with different reservoirs .",
    "depending on the type of reservoirs , various types of thermodynamic quantities are kept to be fixed in the systems , for example , a temperature ( by the heat reservoir ) , a chemical potential ( by the particle reservoir ) and a pressure .",
    "because of the importance of interactions with a thermal reservoir in the foundation and applications of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , many effective dynamical approaches to interactions with a thermal reservoir have been proposed , such as the langevin or the fokker - planck equations @xcite , hamiltonian dynamics with a linear coupling with infinite number of harmonic oscillators ( e.g. the caldeira - leggett model ) @xcite , the deterministic thermostat dynamics ( e.g. the nose - hoover thermostat and the isokinetic thermostat ) @xcite , the anderson thermostat @xcite and the local monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been done to check justifications of these approaches as thermostats , via calculations of various statistical - mechanical properties like the ergodicity and momentum distributions , leading to their improvements @xcite .",
    "the stochastic boundary approach is a dynamical method to take into account of effects of interactions with a thermal reservoir as boundary conditions involving stochastic processes . in this approach , for example",
    ", interactions of a system with a thermal reservoir on a boundary @xmath0 are described by the boundary condition on @xmath0 in which the momentum distribution of particles coming from the boundary @xmath0 is given by the equilibrium distribution corresponding to the temperature of the heat reservoir @xcite .",
    "systems with such stochastic boundary conditions as a coupling with a single heat reservoir relaxes to an equilibrium state with the temperature of the reservoir , and dissipations in the systems occur on the boundary @xmath0 . in systems with the stochastic boundary conditions , some statistical - mechanical features , such as consistencies with the kinetic theory @xcite , the local equilibrium hypothesis @xcite , the specific heat @xcite and spatial energy distributions @xcite , have been investigated . in the sense of using boundary conditions to describe coupling with a thermal reservoir , the methods using the master equation @xcite , numerical evaluations of boundary conditions @xcite or quantum scattering techniques @xcite , etc .",
    ", are also regarded as stochastic boundary approaches . in general , these methods introduce interactions with a thermal reservoir without explicit degrees of freedom of particles inside the reservoir , leading to a simple and effective treatment of interactions with the reservoir . this approach can be used to describe nonequilibrium properties and phenomena , such as onsager s reciprocal relations @xcite , heat currents @xcite , electric currents @xcite and thermoelectric effects @xcite .",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to discuss the stochastic boundary conditions for many - particle systems coupling to a particle reservoir with particle - particle interactions . in order to describe effects of coupling to a particle reservoir",
    ", we introduce the particle injection rate to the system from the reservoir via the boundary @xmath0 in terms of the pressure of the reservoir which specifies a momentum transport via @xmath0 , while the momentum distribution of injected particles on @xmath0 is given by the equilibrium distribution corresponding to the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "since the pressure and the momentum distribution of the injected particles on @xmath0 are given by the temperature @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath2 of the particle reservoir , our particle - injecting stochastic boundary ( pisb ) conditions are specified by these thermodynamic quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 as external parameters .    as applications of this formulation to equilibrium many - particle systems , we consider ideal gases and many - hard - disk systems .",
    "because of a simplicity of hard - core interactions , hard - disk ( or hard - sphere ) systems , as typical examples of many - particle systems with particle - particle interactions , have been widely used to investigate statistical - mechanical properties by numerical methods @xcite and analytical methods @xcite . since equilibrium",
    "statistical - mechanical quantities not only of ideal gases but also of many - hard - disk systems in low - density cases can be calculated analytically based on the grand - canonical distribution , we use these systems to show that the systems with the pisb conditions can reproduce correctly equilibrium properties of the systems coupled to a particle reservoir .",
    "furthermore , we apply our pisb conditions to particle - escape phenomena @xcite , as a typical example of nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "we consider the systems in which hard disks escaping from a particle reservoir into one end of a tube leave from another end of the tube , and produce a steady particle current inside the tube after a long time . by using the pisb approach , we analyze statistical - mechanical properties of hard disks inside the tube , such as a dependence of the current with respect to the chemical potential of the reservoir , deviations from local equilibrium behaviors , the particle density and the local pressure of the system .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
