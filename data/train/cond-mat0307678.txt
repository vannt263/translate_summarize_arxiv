    "two - triplon bound states only exist in a finite region about @xmath103 . increasing the frustration leads to a shift of spectral weight to higher energies . at @xmath30 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the spectral weight is shifted almost totally to the upper band edge at @xmath96 .",
    "this transfer of spectral weight is also found for @xmath221 by exact diagonalization at finite temperatures@xcite .",

    "in contrast to our finding for the unfrustrated spin chain , field theory predicts a square root divergence for the lower band edge of the dynamical structure factor of the sine - gordon model .",

    "we showed that in the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( corresponding to renormalization in first order ) the marginal operator @xmath131 is as important as the mass operator @xmath154 at any finite dimerization .",
    "renormalization in second order , however , predicts a slow logarithmic suppression of the marginal term@xcite below the critical frustration .",

    "the applicability of the sine - gordon model to the unfrustrated , but dimerized spin chain is further questioned by the study of the excitation energies of the bound states . the ratio of the excitation energies of the @xmath2 two - triplon bound state and the one - triplon gap is exactly @xmath141 in the su(2 ) -symmetric sine - gordon model .",
    "we find this ratio only for @xmath25 in agreement with a previous numerical study @xcite . at present",

    "we can not exclude completely that one has to go to much lower values of the dimerization , i.e. , closer to @xmath221 .",
    "but in view of the fact that the marginal operator can not be neglected for a quantitative description , we presume that the effective low - energy model to be considered is the double sine - gordon model for which the su(2 ) symmetry condition will be different from @xmath128 and hence also the ratios of the breather energies will differ from the ratios known for the sine - gordon model @xcite .    in the second part of this work , we discussed spectral properties of the dimerized and frustrated spin chain for excitations with total spin zero which are relevant for optical experiments .",
    "we presented results for the two - triplon contribution which contains most of the spectral weight .",
    "we examined two different observables : a nearest neighbor ( nn ) coupling on the weak bonds @xmath203 and a next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) coupling @xmath180 .",
    "the observables obey different symmetries .",
    "the nearest neighbor coupling possesses a reflection symmetry about @xmath103 .",
    "the next - nearest coupling does not have any reflection symmetry except for @xmath96 where it is odd so that no even @xmath2 two - triplon state can be excited .",
    "the spectral densities for both observables are dominated by the two - triplon bound state @xmath193 which contains most of the spectral weight .",
    "this bound state exists for all momenta independent of dimerization and frustration . the binding energy increases by turning on the frustration .",
    "the spectral weight of the two - triplon continuum is concentrated at the lower band edge for all considered values of dimerization and frustration . for finite dimerization",
    ", the lower band edge displays a square root behavior for @xmath32 in accordance with the results of the sine - gordon model .",
    "divergences may occur only at exactly zero dimerization .",
    "the behavior changes similarly to the @xmath1 case if a two - triplon bound state is almost degenerate with the lower band edge of the two - triplon continuum .",
    "such a degeneracy appeared in our data for @xmath226 and for @xmath227 .",
    "finally , we presented results for the raman response and the infrared absorption .",
    "both experiments are dominated for the values of dimerization considered by the bound state @xmath193 .",
    "this bound state produces two van - hove singularities in the infrared absorption resulting from @xmath103 and @xmath96 .",
    "the van - hove singularity at lower energies becomes more important for larger values of the frustration .",
    "we have shown that continuous unitary transformations ( cuts ) are an excellent tool to calculate spectral densities in high resolution for the dimerized and frustrated heisenberg chain .",
    "we provided a detailed study of the spectral densities and extracted the generic features of the spectral properties .",
    "these data will help to analyze a large variety of spectroscopic measurements for dimerized and frustrated spin chains systems .",
    "we used a description in terms of triplons ( elementary triplets ) carrying @xmath1 .",
    "previously@xcite , we had shown for unfrustrated chains that a description in terms of two triplons is sufficient even in the limit of zero dimerization .",
    "the triplon may also serve as an elementary excitation of the uniform heisenberg chain besides the well - established spinon excitation . in the present work",
    ", we found further strong support for this result .",
    "the two - triplon spectral densities computed at finite dimerization displayed well - developed precursors of the results for the uniform chain based on spinons , e.g. , the dynamical structure factor probing the @xmath1 sector@xcite or the optical absorption@xcite probing the @xmath2 sector .    in the frustrated case",
    "it is as yet an open issue whether a triplonic description works also in the limit of zero dimerization .",
    "especially the gapped phase @xmath228 requires that the two - spinon continuum between @xmath98 and @xmath163 can be described by a dense distribution of bound many - triplon states . for this to occur an infinite - range effective interaction is necessary which is beyond the scope of the perturbative cuts .",
    "but we take the nice agreement between the shifts of spectral weight obtained by complete exact diagonalization at finite temperatures@xcite for the undimerized frustrated chain with our results at finite dimerization as indication that the triplon description can be extended to the undimerized frustrated chain , too .    the comparison of our results to those obtained by mapping the spin chain to a sine - gordon model led to a number of insights .",
    "both approaches agree that the generic singularity at the lower band edge is a square root , either a divergence or a zero .",
    "the divergence occurs if and only if a bound state is degenerate with the band edge .",
    "it turned out that the predictions of the single sine - gordon model hold for critical frustration only in agreement with previous conclusions based on numerical results@xcite .",
    "the general spin chain at non - vanishing dimerization requires to go beyond the single sine - gordon model .",
    "we showed analytically that in the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( equivalent to first order renormalization ) the umklapp term is as large as the mass term @xcite .",
    "the present study based on perturbative continuous unitary transformation is limited by the tractable maximum range of hopping and interaction processes which correlates with the maximum order .",
    "thus an investigation of the spectral properties for small and zero gaps , i.e. , dimerizations , will require to develop new methods allowing for larger ranges ( correlation lengths ) .",
    "the continuous unitary transformations do not need to be realized perturbatively .",
