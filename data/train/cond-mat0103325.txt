    "in recent years , there has been quite a considerable amount of work in models in which glassy behavior is generated not by quenched disorder , but by kinetic constraints .",
    "the kinetic restrictions are responsible for the slow relaxation , since the state of a particle or a group of particles can only change if some condition of its environment is fulfilled .",
    "in particular , `` facilitated ''",
    "models have been considered , both for structural glasses @xcite and for granular systems @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of facilitated models is that a particle ( spin ) can only change its state if a certain number of its neighbors is in an excited state .",
    "also , hierarchically constrained models have been used to study stretched exponential relaxation in glasses @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the system is structured in levels and a particle in a given level can only make a transition if a given cluster of particles in the lower level is in a certain subset of configurations .",
    "then , the dynamics of the several levels are coupled , and the characteristic relaxation times increase with the level index .",
    "hierarchically constrained dynamics may be relevant for those complex systems in which the time evolution of the slowest modes is controlled by the relaxation of the fastest ones .",
    "this qualitative picture is adequate to describe , among other problems , proteins relaxation @xcite and the densification of powders and structural glasses at high pressure @xcite .",
    "very recently , a kind of hierarchically constrained dynamics has been shown to exhibit , in quite a natural way , logarithmic relaxation @xcite .",
    "this kind of `` anomalous '' , highly nonexponential , decay is observed in a wide variety of complex systems , including spin - glasses @xcite , granular materials @xcite , structural glasses @xcite and protein models @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the dynamical behavior of a general class of hierarchically constrained models when submitted to more complicated processes . in particular",
    ", we are interested in the behavior of a system with hierarchical constraints when the temperature changes in time , what makes the coupling between the levels be time - dependent .",
    "the consideration of time - dependent temperature processes requires an extension of the original model as formulated by palmer et al .",
    "@xcite . this will be done in a very simple , but natural , way : the coupling between the levels vary in time because the probability of a cluster configuration allowing to relax a particle in the next level depends on the temperature . on the other hand , neither the number of particles in a given level nor the length of the clusters `` facilitating '' the relaxation depend on the temperature .",
    "they are considered as quantities defined in the coarse - grained description of the system introduced to model the physical problem at hand .",
    "let us note that hierarchical models can also be applied to the analysis of non - thermal systems , as granular materials in the dense regime .",
    "for those materials , thermal energy is not enough to make the system explore the phase space of configurations .",
    "then , the system must be externally excited , for instance vibrating it , in order to be able to evolve . in these situations , the role of the temperature is played by the intensity of the external driving .",
    "if the stationary state reached by the system in the long time limit can be described by edward s theory @xcite , the compactivity @xmath0 , which is the analogous of the temperature in thermal systems , will be a function of the intensity of the external force .",
    "then , by exploiting the analogies of edward s theory , i.  e. , substituting volume by energy and compactivity by temperature , it is possible to incorporate non - thermal systems in our formulation .    processes in which the temperature is time - dependent are physically relevant because they can be used to study some characteristic dynamical aspects of glasses .",
    "for instance , when a supercooled liquid is cooled down to very low temperatures , a laboratory glass transition is observed . a dramatic change in the behavior of the system takes place , and",
    "it departs from the equilibrium curve , getting `` frozen '' in a far from equilibrium state .",
    "this transition appears as a consequence of the fast increase of the relaxation time with decreasing temperature . in order to characterize the cooling process",
    ", experimental physicists often use the residual value of the relevant physical properties , i.  e. , the difference between their actual values over the cooling curve and the value obtained by extrapolation of the equilibrium curve to the very low temperature region @xcite .",
    "if the system is reheated from the nonequilibrium state , it returns to equilibrium for high temperatures , but it follows a different curve from the cooling one , giving rise to hysteresis effects .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the `` nonlinearity '' of glassy relaxation : the approach towards the equilibrium curve depends on the configuration of the system , measured by the so - called fictive temperature @xcite .",
    "narayanaswami s theory provides a phenomenological explanation of this behavior @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a similar behavior has been found in vibrated granular materials when the tapping intensity is varied in a cyclic way @xcite , although the hysteresis effects are more evident when the heating process begins in a loosely packed state , referred as to the `` irreversible '' branch in the experiments .",
    "we will start from a very general hierarchical spin model , in which pseudospins are organized into levels , labelled by an index @xmath1 .",
    "the pseudospins are assumed to correspond to some coarse - grained description of the system .",
    "they can take only two values , representing , for instance , two possible densities of a certain small subvolume of the system .",
    "one pseudospin in level @xmath2 can only flip between the two possible values if a cluster of @xmath3 spins in level @xmath1 is in a given subset of configurations .",
    "this is the basic characteristic of hierarchically constrained models as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it slows down the relaxation in level @xmath2 , as compared with that of level @xmath1 . here",
    "we will consider the simple choice that all the spins in the cluster must be in the up ( excited ) state .",
    "the exact dynamical equation for the evolution of the pseudospins involves very complicated moments of the probability distribution . to get an exactly solvable model ,",
    "a `` mean - field '' approximation will be introduced .",
    "then , the characteristic relaxation time @xmath4 of level @xmath1 is seen to increase both with the index label @xmath1 , due to the hierarchical constraint , and also with decreasing temperature , since the configurations allowing the system to relax become less probable when the temperature is lowered .",
    "some exact dynamical results for systems described with master equations with time - dependent transition rates are known . in particular , the existence of a `` normal '' solution , i.  e. , a solution of the master equation that is approached by all the others , has been proved on a very general basis @xcite .",
    "the main required conditions are the irreducibility of the markov process for long enough times and that the transition rates be externally controlled , so that they do not depend on the probability distribution of the system .",
    "moreover , it has been established that the normal solution tends to the equilibrium curve for very high temperatures , in continuous heating processes @xcite .",
    "the linear correction of the normal solution with respect to the equilibrium curve has been computed using hilbert s method @xcite .",
    "it is not evident whether these results still hold when approximations are introduced in the dynamics of the system .",
    "in particular , in `` mean - field '' type approximations , the demonstrations in refs .",
    "@xcite are not valid , since the transition rates become functionals of the probability distribution function .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that all the above mentioned properties apply to our simplified model .",
    "this is a good test of the plausibility of the approximations carried out , and perhaps an indication that the results obtained here are more general than the derivations in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the hierarchical model is introduced , and the exact evolution equation for the average spin is obtained . by introducing a mean - field approximation",
    ", this equation can be closed .",

    "the main role played by the normal solution for the understanding of the hysteresis effects shows up .",
    "moreover , the analysis clearly indicates that the relevance of the normal solution is not restricted to near equilibrium situations .",
    "finally , a discussion of the main points in this work is given in sec .",
    "in this section a general kind of spin models with hierarchically constrained dynamics will be introduced .",
    "we will focus on the evolution of the average value of the spin , which is supposed to be the relevant variable .",
    "for instance , in a thermal system it will be directly related to the mean energy .",
    "then , let us consider a system whose degrees of freedom can be classified into levels , labelled by an index @xmath5 .",
    "the degrees of freedom in level @xmath1 will be represented by @xmath6 pseudospins , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is assumed to have the form @xmath9 note that @xmath10 is the occupation number of the `` up '' ( + 1 ) state of the corresponding site . in order to write eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) we have supposed that there is no interaction between the pseudospins , but there is an `` external field '' @xmath11 . for a thermal system , @xmath12 gives the energy of a given microstate of the system , while for a non - thermal system , like a powder , it could be interpreted as the volume of a given , mechanically stable , configuration of `` grains''@xcite . using the terminology for thermal systems , the average value of the dimensionless energy per spin over the ensemble of systems considered is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability that the @xmath15-th spin of level be in the up state",
    ", @xmath16 is the total number of pseudospins , and the angular brackets denote statistical ensemble average .",
    "the system is considered to be in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath17 , so that the equilibrium average value of the pseudospins does not depend either on @xmath15 nor on @xmath1 , and it is given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a dimensionless temperature , @xmath20 , @xmath21 being boltzmann s constant . for the sake of concision , we will drop the asterisk in the following .",
    "the above average value of the spin follows from the equilibrium probability for the `` up '' state of any spin , @xmath22 in the limit of infinite temperature , or zero external field , both states of the pseudospins are equiprobable , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . from eq .",
    "( [ 2.3a ] ) , it follows that the equilibrium value of @xmath25 is @xmath26 for granular materials , the role of the temperature @xmath17 is played by the compactivity @xcite , which is linked to the intensity of the perturbation allowing the system to explore the configuration space .",
    "the dynamics of the model is formulated by means of a master equation with single - spin flip glauber transition rates @xcite .",
    "let us consider the flip of a given spin @xmath27 .",
    "this transition connects a given configuration @xmath28 of the whole system with the configuration @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the operator which rotates the spin @xmath27 , keeping all the other spins the same .",

    "this expression implies that the spin @xmath27 needs , in order to flip , that all the spins belonging to a cluster of length @xmath35 starting at a given spin @xmath36 of level @xmath37 must be in the up ( + 1 ) state . besides , the characteristic flip rate of the spin is the average of the characteristic flip rates of the spins belonging to the cluster determining its possibility of change .",
    "this restricting condition is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "note that the possibility of a given spin in level @xmath1 to flip is restricted by the state of a set of clusters in all levels @xmath38 , the number of clusters involved in each level increasing as @xmath39 decreases .",
    "the hierarchical constraint implies that the configuration with all the spins in the down ( -1 ) state is completely absorbent , i.  e. , the system does not evolve in time from that configuration .",
    "we are interested in the time evolution of the average spin @xmath27 , which is given in glauber dynamics by @xcite @xmath40 and substitution of eqs .",
