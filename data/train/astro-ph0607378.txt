    "while perhaps not surprising to agn - astronomers , over the past five to ten years , the notion that a supermassive black hole ( smbh ; @xmath11 ) resides at the heart of every significantly large ( @xmath12 ) galaxy bulge , even inactive bulges , has changed from a dubious idea to a mainstream belief .",
    "support for the tide - of - opinion change has , in part , arisen from studies of our own galaxy .",
    "schdel ( 2003 ) and ghez et al .",
    "( 2005 , and references therein , see also broderick & narayan 2006 ) have shown that the mass required inside of the innermost resolved volume of the milky way is sufficiently large that it rules out alternatives to a smbh , such as a cluster of dead stars or stellar mass black holes which , if they did once exist , have surely now merged to form a single , massive object ( e.g. , miller 2006 ) . although there is only one other sufficiently well resolved galaxy where such a conclusion can be drawn , ngc  4258 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , it seems reasonable to accept that the dark concentrations of mass at the centers of other galaxies are also smbhs , and we adopt this convention , or at least terminology , here .",
    "roughly some three dozen galaxies are close enough that their central , smbh mass has been measured directly through its influence on the motion of the surrounding gas and stars ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001a ; ferrarese & ford 2005 , their table  ii ) . to acquire the mass of the central dark object in other ( inactive ) galaxies requires an alternative approach , and a number of indirect means to do so",
    "have been proposed ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; novak , faber & dekel 2006 ) .",
    "perhaps the most often used relation  due to the small level of scatter ( @xmath130.3 dex )  is the @xmath3@xmath14 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) . with an equivalent level of scatter , and the advantage of requiring only galaxy images rather than spectra ,",
    "is the @xmath3@xmath0 relation ( graham et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a ) , where @xmath0 is a measure of the concentration of the stars within the bulge .",
    "more precisely , @xmath0 is the inverse exponent from the best - fitting srsic ( 1963 ) @xmath15 light - profile ( see graham & driver 2005 for a review of this model ) .",
    "other relations , often reported to have more scatter than the above two relations , are the @xmath3@xmath16 and the @xmath3@xmath17 relations ( kormendy 1993 ; magorrian et al .",
    "although , recent studies which have excluded the disk - dominated spiral galaxies ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2002 ) , or used only the bulge luminosity from the disk galaxies after performing an accurate bulge / disk decomposition ( e.g. , erwin et al .  2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) have obtained a relationship with a similarly low level of scatter ( see also hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "all of these empirical relations can be , and indeed must be , used to constrain any _ complete _ theory or model of galaxy / smbh co - evolution .",
    "furthermore , all of these relations can be used to gauge the mass of smbhs in other galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we use the srsic index @xmath0 , together with updated smbh masses ( section  2 ) , to derive the first @xmath3@xmath0 relation constructed for the purpose of predicting @xmath3 in other galaxies ( section  3 ) .",
    "this relation may differ from the intrinsic , astrophysical relation presented in graham et al .",
    "( 2003a ) due to the different method of regression that is required .",
    "armed with such a relation , one requires only images  which need not even be photometrically calibrated  to predict accurate smbhs in other galaxies .",
    "additional advantages with the use of a global measure such as @xmath0 , are that it is not heavily affected by possible kinematical sub - structure at the center of a bulge , nor by rotational velocity or vertical dispersion of an underlying disk , nor aperture corections . furthermore , the quantity @xmath0 is cheap to acquire in terms of telescope time and unlike absolute magnitudes and masses , it does not depend on galaxy distance nor an uncertain mass - to - light ratio .    as noted in graham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , there is no _ a priori _ reason to presume that the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is linear , and we therefore explore the suitability of a a quadratic equation . in so doing , we find the second order term is inconsistent with a value of zero at the 99.99% confidence level ( section  3.2 )",
    ". implications at the low- and high-@xmath0 end of the relation are discussed , relative to the optimal linear fit .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will apply this quadratic relation to the millennium galaxy catalog ( liske et al .",
    "2003 ; cross et al .  2004 ; driver et al .",
    "2006 ) containing 10 095 galaxies  which have been modeled with a srsic - bulge plus exponential - disk ( allen et al .",
    "2006 )  to determine the local supermassive black hole mass function ( e.g. , salucci et al .  1999 ;",
    "yu & tremaine 2002 ; granato et al .",
    "2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "2004 ) and space density in both early- and late - type galaxies .    in section  4",
    "we expand the @xmath3@xmath0 diagram into an @xmath20@xmath0 diagram , where @xmath21 is the mass of the central compact object , which may be a smbh or a nuclear star cluster .",
    "we show that the nuclear star clusters in early - type galaxies appear to follow the curved @xmath3@xmath0 relation defined by galaxies with smbhs , and we discuss some of the implications this may entail . in section  5 we show that our @xmath3@xmath0 relation is independent of the hubble constant .",
    "given there are now several relations between smbh mass and the properties the host bulge , in section  6 we briefly present some musings as to what may be the fundamental primary relation . in this section we derive a new set of equations relating the smbh mass to the ( extrapolated ) central surface density of the host bulge .",
    "finally , in section  7 we provide a brief summary of the paper .",
    "our sample is comprised of the 21 galaxies used in graham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) plus an additional six new galaxies .    a discussion of the original galaxy light - profiles can be found in erwin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , see also trujillo et al .",
    "due to updated galaxy distances and smbh mass measurements , and a refined analysis of the major - axis light - profiles , some of the 27 data points ( 14 e and 13 s0/sp ) given in table  [ table1 ] are slightly different to those published in graham et al .",
    "( 2001 , their table 1 ) and shown in graham et al.(2003a , their figure 1 ) .",
    "however , only for two galaxies has the srsic index changed by more than 20%  the typical uncertainty on this index ( e.g. , caon , capaccioli , & donofrio 1993 ) .",
    "we briefly comment on these two galaxies here and present their new srsic fits in appendix  a.    although the bulge of the milky way is nowadays recognised as having an exponential ( @xmath22 ) light - profile , we have fitted the near - infrared data from kent , dame , & fazio ( 1991 ) and report an index of @xmath23 rather than exactly 1 .",
    "the second galaxy in question is ngc  4564 .",
    "subsequent to the analysis in trujillo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , ngc  4564 is now recognized as an s0 galaxy that was mis - classified as an e galaxy .",
    "an @xmath15-bulge plus exponential - disk decomposition has therefore been performed .",
    "this resulted in its bulge srsic index @xmath0 increasing from 2.1 to 3.2 .",
    "four of the six new galaxies are listed in ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) ( ngc  3115 , 4486 , 4649 , 4697 ) and our srsic fits to their light - profiles are also presented in appendix  a. in addition , we have used the bulge / disk decomposition shown in graham ( 2002 ) for the supposedly `` compact elliptical '' galaxy ngc  221 ( m32 ) , which was not included in our original paper .",
    "we have also been able to include ngc  1399 ( houghton et al .",
    "2006 ) , which previously had no direct smbh mass estimate .",
    "this galaxy s light - profile has been modeled in donofrio , capaccioli , & caon ( 1994 ) and we adopt their srsic index having obtained the same value from our own fitting of their data .    despite our attempt to include all of the lowest and highest mass smbhs , as these data points can have substantial weight on any fitted relation , we have not included the peculiar elliptical galaxy ic  1459 due to uncertainty on both its smbh mass and its srsic index @xmath0 .",
    "this galaxy displays clear signs of past interaction , evidenced by stellar tidal tails ( malin 1985 ) and stellar shells and ripples at large radii ( forbes & reitzel 1995 ) . due to its unrelaxed , disturbed morphology ,",
    "its light - profile is not well fitted with an @xmath15 model .",
    "it also possesses a fast counter - rotating stellar core .",
    "while the stellar dynamics of the core suggest a smbh mass of @xmath24 , the gas dynamics reveal the mass could be as low as @xmath25 ( cappellari et al .",
    "2002 ) .    the upper section of table  ii in ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) lists 25 galaxies with smbh masses derived from resolved dynamical studies .",
    "a further five galaxies in this list have marginally resolved mass estimates , with @xmath26 . aside from ic  1459 , we are only missing quality @xmath27-band images for three of these 30 galaxies : ngc  3608 , ngc  5128 ( centaurus  a ) and the relatively distant ( @xmath28 ) galaxy cygnus  a.    most of our 27 galaxies have distances from tonry et al .",

    "several factors can contribute to the size of this term , including errors in the sky - subtraction , uncertainties in the point - spread - function , the presence of bars which are typically not modeled in bulge / disk decompositions , the influence of additional nuclear components such as star clusters or nuclear disks , and partially depleted cores .",

    "the answer is yes ( merritt 2006 and references therein ) . for the local group galaxy ngc  221 ( m32 )",
    ", the excess central flux above the srsic model may not represent a distinct additional central massive object , as is the case with the nuclei in ngc  205 ( valluri et al .",

    "in contrast , the majority of the lower - luminosity srsic ( `` power - law '' ) galaxies in table  [ table1 ] _ do _ show excess nuclear flux . however , this is usually due to an agn .",
    "two exceptions are ngc  3384 and ngc  7457 , which possess both a smbh _ and _ a central star cluster ( ravindranath et al .",
    "2001 ) .",

    "creating a new @xmath171@xmath0 diagram would move ngc  7457 ( which has the second lowest smbh mass in our sample ) so that it overlaps with a cluster of three other data points seen in figure  [ fig - quad ]  leaving it consistent with the quadratic shown there .",
    "successive mergers of nucleated , low-@xmath0 , low - luminosity galaxies will eventually result in a galaxy whose mass is sufficient to expect a smbh .",
    "this then raises the tantalising possibility of the _ recent _ formation of some smbhs from the merger of two , or more , nucleated galaxies and the subsequent merger and ` runaway collision ' of their respective nuclear star clusters . to date , such a collisional process in star clusters has only been invoked to explain the formation of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs : quinlan & shapiro 1990 ; portegies zwart et al .  1999 ; freitag , grkan , & rasio 2006 ) .",
    "we are , however , unaware of the actual dwarf - dwarf galaxy collision rate today , and do not wish to suggest it is a frequent phenomenon .",
    "the formation scenario proposed here for potential _ young _ smbhs is perhaps , at face value , contrary to the conventional scenario in which they form via gas accretion during the height of quasar activity . indeed ,",
    "massive black holes have long been known to exist at high - redshifts , @xmath172 . nonetheless , we do not rule out a kind of `` downsizing '' or late - time formation of low - mass smbhs built through a relatively dry runaway merger of nuclear star clusters .",
    "while involving no significant agn feedback , such a process could still maintain the @xmath173 mass ratio .",
    "_ if _ there are appreciable numbers of _ young _ smbhs built from the merger of nuclei , this may require a downward revision to measurements of the average radiative efficiency of smbhs and thus their implied rate of rotation ( e.g. , ferrarese 2002 ; shankar et al.2004 ; wang et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the above linear and curved relations are nearly , but not completely , independent of the hubble constant . while the srsic indices are independent of galaxy distance , the smbh masses depend linearly on the distance to each galaxy .",
    "distances for 24 of our 27 galaxies were obtained from surface brightness fluctuation measurements and are thus independent of the hubble constant , as of course is the milky way center . however ,",
    "a hubble constant of 73 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 was used to derive the distances to ngc  6251 and ngc  7052 from their redshift .",
    "studies which use the @xmath3@xmath0 relation , or indeed the @xmath3@xmath14 relation , need to know if the smbh masses predicted from the relation are dependent on @xmath174 .",
    "if they are , then the hubble constant needs to factored into such mass derivations and thus also estimates of the smbh mass function and space density .",
    "we have therefore rederived the quadratic @xmath3@xmath0 relation excluding ngc  6251 and ngc  7052 , so as to remove any possible dependency on @xmath174 . doing so , we obtain @xmath175 ^ 2 $ ] , with @xmath176 dex .    this is not significantly different from the expression given in equation  [ eqquad ] .",
    "in fact , the main reason for the slight shift in numbers is because of the exclusion of ngc  6251  which resides at the high-@xmath0 end of the relation , and thus has more weight than individual points in the middle of the relation  rather than the use of @xmath177 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 for this galaxy .",
    "this is evidenced by using @xmath178 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 for ngc  6251 and ngc  7052 and adjusting their smbh masses accordingly , which results in @xmath179 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this expression is closer to equation  [ eqquad ] than the expression in the previous paragraph is to equation  [ eqquad ] , and reveals that the exclusion of ngc  6251 and ngc  7052 introduces more of a change than the use of an uncertain hubble constant .",
    "it therefore makes sense to use equation  [ eqquad ] and , given the uncertainties on the fitted parameters @xmath180 and @xmath140 , treat equation  [ eqquad ] as if it were independent of the hubble constant .",
    "the same statement is true for equations  [ eq_m_n ] , [ eq_bces ] and [ eq_sym ] .",
    "there are now several relations between smbh mass and the properties of the host bulge , such as luminosity , mass , velocity dispersion within some radius , and concentration . which of these is the most fundamental remains unanswered ( novak et al .",
    "it may be that none of these are the drivers of the smbh - bulge connection , but that all are symptomatic of a more profound relation .",
    "for instance , the combination of concentration and central density might be what is important  as this defines both the baryonic distribution and the strength of the gravitational potential with radius , at least until dark matter becomes a significant factor .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to expect that this might influence , or possibly even dictate , the ability of a bulge to fuel any central smbh .",
    "the motion of the stars within a bulge , traced through the observable @xmath14 , is the dynamical _ response _ to the underlying mass distribution .",
    "while @xmath14 is therefore a tracer of mass , it is obviously dependent on how that mass is distributed , and is thus a ) a function of the central stellar density and b ) has a radial dependence which is set by the stellar concentration , at least within @xmath181 ( lintott , ferreras , & lahav 2006 ) .",
    "while the smbh mass might be a product of the radial mass distribution , specified by the central density and concentration , the observed relation between central density and concentration ( e.g. , graham & guzmn 2003 , their figure  9 ; merritt 2006 , his figure  5 ) subsequently means that one can express the smbh mass in terms of just one of these quantities .",
    "extrapolating under the nuclear star clusters in low - luminosity bulges , and over the partially - depleted cores in giant galaxies  whose central stellar density has been modified by the slingshot effect of coalescing smbhs  gives an estimate of a bulge s ( original ) central stellar density .",
    "given the @xmath3@xmath0 relations derived in this paper , we can predict a correlation between @xmath3 and central stellar density .    substituting @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the central @xmath184-band surface density ( graham & guzmn 2003 ) versus @xmath10 with the present data set .",
    "] , into equation  [ eq_m_n ] gives @xmath185 a relatively large uncertainty on the central surface brightness of 1 mag arcsec@xmath186 translates to an uncertainty of only 0.19 dex in the logarithm of the smbh mass , a value comparable to the intrinsic scatter found for equation  [ eqquad ] .",
    "substitution of the above term for @xmath95 into equation  [ eqquad ] gives @xmath187    these two expressions differ most in their prediction of smbh masses at the low mass end ( figure  [ fig - m - mu0 ] ) , with the linear relation predicting @xmath188 masses if @xmath189-mag , and the quadratic relation predicting masses of @xmath190 at this faint central surface brightness",
    ".    although we are unable to conclude that an @xmath3@xmath10 relation is more , or even equally , fundamental than any other relation involving smbh mass , we do consider it prudent to explore this possibility .",
    "we hope to acquire calibrated , high - resolution , near - infrared images to further investigate this proposed relation . due to the random projection angles of triaxial bulges on the plane of the sky",
    ", one might expect a certain amount of variability in the observed values of @xmath183 .",
    "we therefore note that it may be advantageous to construct a plot of smbh versus the deprojected ( internal ) central density .",
    "such a program , however , is beyond the intended scope of this paper .",

    "the solid line corresponds to equation  [ eqmulin ] , the dashed line corresponds to equation  [ eqmuquad ] . ]",
    "we have constructed the @xmath3@xmath0 relation using updated smbh masses and refined galaxy light - profile shapes , @xmath0 .",
    "we performed an ordinary least squares , linear regression of @xmath3 on @xmath0 that allows for measurement errors and intrinsic scatter @xmath102 , to obtain @xmath191 , with @xmath192 dex in @xmath18 .",
    "we additionally considered the possibility that the @xmath3@xmath0 relation may not be linear , and applied a quadratic fit to account for the apparent curvature in the distribution .",
    "although an arbitrary empirical function , the second order term in the quadratic fit @xmath138 ^ 2 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an intrinsic scatter @xmath139 dex , is inconsistent with a value of zero at the 99.99% confidence level .",
    "these relations were constructed with the objective of obtaining a relation that can be used to predict smbh masses in other galaxies for which the bulge srsic index is known .",
    "unlike the linear relation , the quadratic relation predicts finite smbh masses at the high-@xmath0 end , and @xmath6 mass black holes when @xmath193 , rather than @xmath8 obtained with the linear relation .    the srsic index , a quantity obtained from uncalibrated images , and independent of galaxy distance , offers an easy way to acquire accurate estimates of black hole masses in other galaxies .",
    "moreover , the strength of the correlation ( @xmath194 ) implies a fundamental connection that theory is yet to explain .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the nuclear star clusters at the centers of low - luminosity bulges appear to follow the same log - quadratic @xmath3@xmath0 relation .",
    "this is suggestive , although not conclusive , that a similar formation mechanism may be responsible for the build up of massive compact objects ( whether black holes or star clusters ) at the centers of bulges .",
    "finally , in section  [ secmu0 ] we have derived , for the first time , the expected linear and quadratic relation connecting the mass of a smbh with the central surface brightness of its host bulge ( figure  [ fig - m - mu0 ] )",

    "( 2000 ) , and for the milky way we used the near - infrared light - profile from kent , dame , & fazio ( 1991 ) .    for the @xmath27-band images ,",
    "the light - profiles were obtained in the standard way .",
    "foreground stars and background galaxies were carefully masked , and the sky - background flux was determined from the mean of @xmath1310 median fluxes that were obtained from small boxes we positioned near the ( galaxy - free ) corners of each chip .",
    "the light - profiles were extracted using the iraf task ellipse , with the isophotal position angle and ellipticity free to vary , but the centroid fixed .",
    "an interesting deviation from the above recipe pertains to the analysis of the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc  3115 .",
    "its light - profile was obtained using another isophotal fitting routine written in iraf ( jerjen , kalnajs & bingelli 2000 ) .",
    "after the foreground and background objects , and non - symmetrical features about the nominal galaxy centre , were removed from the image , a symmetrical two - dimensional ( 2d ) model was constructed from the remaining light distribution by allowing the isophotal ellipticity and position angle to vary , but keeping the luminosity - weighted centre fixed .",
    "this process was repeated iteratively until the residuals were minimised .",
    "this left a residual image displaying only the edge - on disc of ngc  3115 .",
    "the one - dimensional surface brightness profile of the ( symmetrical ) bulge was then calculated from this 2d model .",
    "foreground stars were fitted with a moffat function that was used to quantify the point spread function in each image . however , in practice this was nt important because in avoiding the potential presence of nuclear star clusters or partially - depleted cores , we first removed the inner @xmath132 seeing disks from the galaxy light - profiles before fitting srsic s ( 1963 ) function .    each light - profile s best - fitting srsic @xmath15 function plus , in the case of ngc  4564 , an exponential disk , was obtained using the subroutine uncmnd from kahaner , moler & nash ( 1989 ) . at each iteration , the nonlinear ( seeing - convolved ) srsic function ( plus exponential function when modelling ngc  4564 ) was approximated by a quadratic function derived from a taylor series .",
    "the quadratic function was minimised to obtain a search direction , and an approximate minimum of the nonlinear function along the search direction found using a line search .",
    "the algorithm computes an approximation to the second derivative matrix of the nonlinear function using quasi - newton techniques .",
    "the galaxy light - profiles and best - fitting models are displayed in figures  [ appfig1 ] and [ appfig2 ] .",
    "one can see , particularly from the residual profiles in the lower panels , that the fitted models perform well at matching the curvature in the light - profiles .",
    "this curvature , specifically , the srsic index @xmath0 , is observed to correlate strongly with a bulge s central supermassive black hole ( e.g. , figure  [ fig - quad ] ) ."
