    "khon - sham equations  @xcite are central to the practical application of density functional theory ( dft ) . to solve them , an approximation to the exchange and correlation energy is required from which an exchange and correlation potential is derived .",
    "the way in which this term is approximated is crucial to the proper description of the band structure of solids .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite and the meta - gga  @xcite , among others , describe very well the electronic band structure of even complicated metallic systems .",
    "they fail , nevertheless to account for the band gap value of semiconducting systems , a short come known for several years now  @xcite .",
    "efforts to solve this problem were done since long ago .",
    "approximations as the  scissor operator \"  @xcite , the local spin density approximation , lsda+u  @xcite and methods based on the use of green s functions and perturbation theory as the gw approximation , gwa  @xcite , were proposed . in the last ten years , these efforts gave rise to substantially improved results .",
    "some of the new proposals include , the screened hybrid functional of heyd , scuseria and ernzerhof ( hse )  @xcite and the middle - range exchange and correlation hybrid functional of henderson , izmaylov , scuseria and savin ( hiss )  @xcite .",
    "another recent proposal is the empirical potential the modified becke - jonhson potential ( mbjlda ) proposed by tran and blaha  @xcite .",
    "this potential was introduced to the wien2k code  @xcite in 2010 .",
    "recently , we made a detailed analysis of the mbjlda potential based on the calculation of the electronic band structure of 41 semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "this paper is a continuation of that work .",
    "we found an important improvement in the predictions of the band gap as compared to experiment .",
    "the mbjlda potential  @xcite is a empirical potential of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the spin dependent density of states , @xmath2 is the kinetic energy density of the particles with spin @xmath3 .",
    "and @xmath4 is the becke - roussel potential ( _ br _ )  @xcite .",
    "the c stands for @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 are free parameters .",
    "the wien2k code defines @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "these values are general but certainly fixed experimenting with several cases .",
    "a particular feature of this potential is that a corresponding exchange and correlation energy term , @xmath11 $ ] , such that the mbjlda potential is obtained in the usual way , namely , @xmath12/\\delta \\rho$ ] , is not possible . as a consequence , a consistent optimization procedure to obtain the lattice parameters , the bulk modulus and its derivative with respect to pressure are not actually possible .",
    "this is a consequence of the empirical character of this potential .",
    "for that reason , tran and blaha have proposed the empirical alternative that prior to a band structure calculation with the mbjlda potential , the lattice parameter is found from either a lda or a gga optimization procedure and the result introduced into the code to perform the band structure calculation of the semiconductor system .",
    "such a procedure gives rise to quite improved results as compared to the previous version of the wien2k code .",
    "it is known that the lda underestimates as a rule , the lattice parameters and , on the contrary , gga overestimates them .",
    "we have explored the possibility of using the averaged value as the lattice parameter , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 ) is the lattice parameter obtained from an lda ( gga ) optimization procedure .",
    "when @xmath13 is used as input into the wien2k code implemented with the mbjlda potential , a better agreement of the band gap value with experiment is obtained as compared to the results with either @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "so this procedure turns out to give better results than the one recommended by tran and blaha and its extra computational cost is relatively low .",
    "a surprising result was , nevertheless , obtained when the experimental low temperature lattice parameter , @xmath18 , was introduced instead .",
    "unexpected deviations of the band gap value from experiment as big as 48% were obtained  @xcite .",
    "this is a disturbing result since the lattice parameters obtained from any optimization procedure are judged to be as good as the deviation from the experimental lattice parameter value is small , and so one expects to get the best result ( the minimum deviation of the predicted band gap value from experiment ) when the experimental lattice parameter is used .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "this fact throws doubts on the meaning of the optimization procedure altogether when the empirical mbjlda code is employed .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that the results obtained for the band gap value of semiconductors using the mbjlda potential represents a relevant improvement at relatively low computational cost , a fact that we will emphasize below .",
    "hybrid functionals are a linear combination of hartree - fock ( hf ) , lda and gga terms and were proposed initially with the aim of improving lda and gga in the calculation of the energy bands of molecules  @xcite .",
    "more recently , hybrid functionals were used as an effort to improve the old - standing problem of the band gap of semiconductors ; they include the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) functional  @xcite proposed in 2003 .",
    "it combines a screened short - range hf term and a screened short- and long - range functional proposed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite .",
    "the screened terms in hse result from splitting the coulomb operator into short- and long - range terms in the following way @xmath19 where the complementary error function @xmath20 and @xmath21 determines the range . the functional form of hse is based on the hybrid functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbeh )  @xcite ( also known in the literature as pbe1pbe and pbe0 )  @xcite , as follows @xmath22 the expression for the hse exchange - correlation energy , @xmath23 , is    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the hf short - range functional ( sr ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the short - range ( sr ) and long - range ( lr ) components of the pbe functional . _ a _ is a mixing constant that is derived from perturbation theory  @xcite . in the literature",
    ", the functional hse appears as hse03 and hse06 .",
    "the difference is in the choice of the value of @xmath21",
    ". we will refer to the hse03 simply as hse , in this work . in 2005 , heyd et al .",
    "@xcite reported a study of the band gap and lattice parameters of semiconductor compounds using the hse functional .",
    "we will comment on these results below .",
    "recently , marques et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed to relate the mixing constant _ a _ to dielectric properties of the solid .",
    "they took @xmath28 .",
    "their calculation using the hybrid functional pbe0 improves the predictions for the band gap value of the 21 semiconductors considered as compared to the original formulation .",
    "furthermore , they used @xmath29 , and @xmath30 where @xmath31 takes the form of the term in parenthesis in eq.(2 ) .",
    "they introduced this form of the @xmath32 parameter into the hybrid functionals pbe0 and hse06 , respectively , and got an improved result .",
    "these proposals improve the performance of the hybrid functionals at no extra cost .",
    "we will comment further on these results below .",
    "another successful potential to calculate the band structure of semiconductors is the middle - range hybrid exchange and correlation henderdon - izmaylov - scuderia - savia functional ( hiss )  @xcite .",
    "it also uses the pbe potential but in a different way , @xmath33 where the last two terms in parentheses are the middle - range ( mr ) exact exchange and middle - range pbe exchange energies , given by    @xmath34    in 2012 , lucero et al .",
    "@xcite reported their study of the band gap and lattice parameters of some semiconductor compounds using hiss , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 y @xmath37 .",
    "these values were determined by fitting them to some atomization energies , barriers hights and values of the gap for some compounds .",
    "as it is well known , the many - body shrdinger equation contains the coulomb interaction term which is a two - body potential and creates the difficulty to solve it for realistic systems . to address this problem",
    ", the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) adds to the average coulomb potential ( the hartree term ) a non - local exchange potential which reflects the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the energy gap of semiconductors predicted in this way turns out to be in most cases too large .",
    "this is due to the neglect of correlations or screening which are crucial in solids . to simulate the effect of correlations , slater introduced the @xmath38 approximation which may be regarded as a precursor of the modern dft . in dft",
    ", the ground state energy can be proved to be a functional of the ground state density but the explicit form of the functional is not known .",
    "the minimization of the total energy functional with respect to the density gives the kohn - sham equations .",
    "the unknown exchange and correlation potential is approximated either by the local density approximation ( lda ) , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) or the meta - gga , among others , which describe metals well but fail to account for the band gap of semiconductors .",
    "the empirical mbjlda potential is a response .",
    "an alternative way to deal with this problem is the gw approximation ( gwa ) .",
    "it is derived from many - body perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the form of the self - energy in the gwa is the same as in the hfa but the coulomb interaction is dynamically screened remedying the most serious deficiency of the hfa .",
    "the corresponding self - energy is therefore non - local and energy dependent .",
    "the green function is obtained from a dyson equation of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 describes the direct propagation without the exchange and correlation interaction and @xmath41 contains all possible exchange and correlation interactions with the system that an electron can have in its propagation .",
    "the gwa may be regarded as a generalization of the hfa but with a dynamically screened coulomb interaction .",
    "the non - local hfa is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "the gwa corresponds to replacing the bare coulomb interaction @xmath44 by a screened interaction w. in the language of perturbation theory this corresponds to @xmath45 for details see ref .",
    "we will analyze the results obtained for the semiconductor gap value using this approximation in what follows .    in 2005 , rinke et al .",
    "@xcite using the so called oepx(clda)+gw approximation obtained a reasonable agreement with experiment when calculating the band gap of a certain number of semiconductors . in 2007 , shishkin et al .",
    "@xcite using a self - consistent gwa ( gwa + dft ) , and the self - consistent gw approximation with attractive electron - hole interaction , scgw(e - h ) accounted quite well for the experimental band gap of several semiconductors .",
    "now we proceed to analyze some of the different offers in the literature in what the calculation of the band gap of semiconductors is concerned and compare their results among themselves and with experiment .",
    "in table [ tab : tabla1 ] , we present the results obtained for the band gap using different methods and approximations .",
    "the first two columns refer to our calculation .",
    "the resulting values using lda and mbjlda  @xcite as in version 2011 of wien2k code are presented .",
    "we have used as lattice parameter the average of the values obtained from an lda and a gga optimization which , as we found  @xcite , gives the best results for the gap as compared to experiment when the mbjlda potential is used .",
    "next we report the values obtained with the hybrid hiss and hse06 functional  @xcite , hse  @xcite and gwa . in the column denoted as gwa , we include the most precise predictions for the gap reported in the literature using either the self consistent gw ( scgwa )  @xcite or the scgwa with attractive electron - hole interaction , scgw(e - h )  @xcite . in fig .",
