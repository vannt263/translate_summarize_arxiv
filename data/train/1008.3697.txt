    "despite the tendency of social actors to become more similar to each other through their local interactions @xcite , global polarization , i.e. , the existence of stable multicultural regimes , is a ubiquitous phenomenon in human society @xcite .",
    "this issue has been addressed by somewhat idealized agent - based simulations of human behavior producing highly nontrivial insights on the nature of the collective behavior that results from the homogenizing local interactions ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    in this line ,",
    "a particularly successful model is axelrod s model for the dissemination of culture or social influence @xcite . in axelrod s model ,",
    "the agents are placed at the sites of a square lattice of size @xmath3 and can interact with their nearest neighbors only .",
    "the culture of an agent is represented by a string of @xmath4 cultural features , where each feature can adopt a certain number @xmath5 of distinct traits .",
    "the interaction between any two neighboring agents takes place with probability proportional to the number of traits they have in common .",
    "although the result of such interaction is the increase of the similarity between the two agents , as one of them modifies a previously distinct trait to match that of its partner , the model exhibits global polarization @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient for the existence of stable globally polarized states in axelrod s model is the rule that prohibits the interaction between agents which do not have any cultural trait in common .",
    "relaxation of this rule so as to permit interactions regardless of the similarity between agents leads to one of the @xmath6 distinct absorbing homogeneous configurations @xcite .",
    "in addition , introduction of external noise so that traits can change at random with some small probability @xcite , as well as the increase of the connectivity of the agents @xcite , destabilizes the polarized state also .",
    "although axelrod s model enjoyed great popularity among the statistical physics community due mainly to the existence of a non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite that separates the globally homogeneous from the globally polarized regimes @xcite , the vulnerability of the polarized absorbing configurations was considered a major drawback to explaining robust collective social behavior . in this vein ,",
    "parisi et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a lattice version of the classic frequency bias mechanism for cultural or opinion change @xcite , which assumes that the number of people holding an opinion is the key factor for an agent to adopt that opinion , i.e. , people have a tendency to espouse cultural traits that are more common in their social environment .",
    "actually , almost any model of cultural transmission admits that the probability that an individual acquires a cultural variant depends on the frequency of that variant in the population .",
    "the frequency - dependent bias mechanism requires , however , that the individual be _ disproportionately _ likely to acquire the more common variant @xcite .",
    "more to the point , in the model of parisi et al .",
    "the culture of an agent is specified by a binary string of length @xmath4 ( so @xmath7 ) and each bit of that string takes the value which is more common among its neighbors @xcite .",
    "since the model can be immediately recognized as @xmath4 independent majority - vote models @xcite , we found the claim by those authors that such model exhibits a polarized regime most intriguing . in order to check whether the multicultural absorbing configurations reported by parisi et al . were not artifacts of the small lattice size used in their study ( @xmath8 ) , in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the effects of the finite size of the lattice by considering square lattices of linear size up to @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath10 to stress the identification with the well - known majority vote model of statistical physics . hence the agents or sites of the lattices are modeled by ising spins .",
    "our findings indicate that the polarized regime is indeed stable in the thermodynamic limit @xmath11 and that the element accountable for this stability is the procedure used to calculate the majority , which includes the site to be updated ( target site ) in addition to its nearest neighbors . for sites in the bulk of the lattice ,",
    "this procedure essentially specifies the criterion of update in case of a tie , i.e. , in case there is no majority among the neighbors . in this case , the majority - vote variant used by parisi et al . leaves the state of the agent untouched , whereas the most common variant used in the literature sets that state at random with probability @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the criterion used by parisi et al .",
    "is actually the original definition of the majority - vote model as introduced in refs .",
    "it is surprising that such ( apparently ) minor implementation detail produces nontrivial consequences in the thermodynamic limit , which can actually be confirmed analytically using a mean - field approach that takes into account the correlation between nearest neighbors  the pair approximation @xcite .",
    "however , the addition of a thermal - like noise such that the individuals may take a stance opposed to the majority opinion with some small probability destabilizes the globally polarized regime leading to one of the two low - temperature homogeneous steady states of the ising model @xcite . in that sense",
    "we disagree with the claim by parisi et al . that their variant of the majority - vote model is more robust than axelrod s model to the effect of this type of noise .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the variant of the majority - vote model proposed by parisi et al . , which henceforth we refer to as the extended majority - vote model since its key ingredient is the stretching of the neighborhood to include the target site @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : mf ] we present the mean - field approach to this model using the single - site and pair approximations @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] we use extensive monte carlo simulations to investigate several properties of the absorbing configurations such as the average number of opinion domains or clusters , the size of the largest cluster and the distribution of cluster sizes , giving emphasis to their dependences on the lattice size . in that section",
    "also we discuss the vulnerability of the heterogeneous opinion regime against a thermal - like noise , which allows the individuals to disagree with the majority opinion . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our concluding remarks .",
    "the agents are fixed at the sites of a square lattice of size @xmath3 with open boundary conditions ( i.e. , agents at the corners interact with two neighbors , agents at the sides with three , and agents in the bulk with four nearest neighbors ) .",
    "the initial configuration is random : the opinion of each agent is set by a random digit @xmath13 or @xmath14 with equal probability . at each time",
    "we pick a target agent at random and then verify which is the more frequent opinion ( @xmath14 or @xmath13 ) among its extended neighborhood , which includes the target agent itself .",
    "the opinion of the target agent is then changed to match the corresponding majority value .",
    "we note that there are no ties for agents in the bulk or at the corners of the square lattice since in these cases the extended neighborhood comprises @xmath15 and @xmath16 sites , respectively .",
    "however , agents at the sides of the lattice have an extended neighborhood of @xmath17 sites ( i.e. , @xmath16 neighbors plus the target agent ) and so in case of a tie , the opinion of the target agent remains unchanged .",
    "of course , in the limit of large lattices the contribution of these boundary sites will be negligible .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the system is frozen in an absorbing configuration .",
    "although the majority - vote rule or , more generally , the frequency bias mechanism for opinion change @xcite is a homogenizing assumption by which the agents become more similar to each other , the above - described model does seem to exhibit global polarization , i.e. , heterogeneous absorbing configurations @xcite . since the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was based on a small lattice of linear size @xmath18 a more careful analysis is necessary to confirm whether this conclusion holds in the thermodynamic limit as well .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the more popular variant of the majority - vote model , in which the state of the target site is not included in the majority reckoning , and ties are decided by choosing the opinion of the target agent at random with probability @xmath12 , the only absorbing states in the thermodynamic limit are the two homogeneous configurations . for finite lattices , however , we find heterogeneous absorbing configurations characterized by stripes that sweep the entire lattice . in sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] we carry out a finite size scaling analysis of the extended majority - vote rule aiming at understanding the nature of the opinion domains that fragment the absorbing configurations .",
    "in this section we offer an analytical approximation to the extended majority - vote model introduced by parisi et al @xcite .",
    "the state of the agent at site @xmath19 of the square lattice is represented by the binary variable @xmath20 and so the configuration of the entire lattice comprising @xmath21 sites is denoted by @xmath22 .",

    "since all sites are equivalent we have @xmath34 and this mean value is given by the equation @xmath35 with @xmath36 as usual .",
    "to carry out this average we need to make approximations . in what follows we study in detail two such approximation schemes , namely , the single - site approximation and the pair approximation .      this the simplest mean - field scheme which assumes that the sites are independent random variables so that eq .",

    "( [ r2e ] ) is indeed invariant to the change @xmath71 .",
    "most surprisingly , this figure uncovers an unexpected dependence on the choice of the ( random ) initial condition @xmath72 and @xmath73 : indeed in the range @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , the equilibrium solution @xmath76 is a smooth function of @xmath72 , i.e. , there is a continuum of fixed points .",

    "the physical reason is that there are in fact many absorbing configurations very close to the random initial configurations and a few lattice updates ( typically 10 ) is sufficient to freeze the dynamics ( see fig .",

    "in this section we first demonstrate that the heterogeneous absorbing configurations of the extended majority - vote model do persist in the thermodynamic limit and then we proceed with the characterization of the opinion domains ( clusters ) that fragment those configurations .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] illustrates one such a configuration for @xmath83 .",
    "we recall that a cluster is simply a connected , bounded lattice region wherein the agents share the same opinion .",
    "we focus on a few relevant statistical quantities to characterize the cluster organization , namely , the average number of clusters @xmath84 , the average size of the largest cluster @xmath85 , and the distribution of cluster sizes @xmath86 .",
    "we must evaluate these quantities for different lattice sizes ( typically we use @xmath87 samples for each @xmath0 ) and then take an appropriate extrapolation procedure to infinite lattices ( @xmath88 ) .    to simulate efficiently the extended majority - vote model for large lattices",
    "we first make a list of the active agents .",
    "an active agent is an agent whose opinion differs from the most frequent opinion among its extended neighborhood .",
    "clearly , only active agents can change their opinions and so it is more efficient to select the target agent randomly from the list of active agents rather than from the entire lattice . in the case that the opinion of the target agent is modified by the majority - vote rule , we need to re - examine the active / inactive status of the target agent as well as of all its neighbors so as to update the list of active agents .",
    "the dynamics is frozen when the list of active agents is empty .",
    "the implementation of a similar procedure allowed the simulation of axelrod s model for very large lattices and the clarification of several issues regarding the stability of the heterogeneous absorbing configurations of that model @xcite .",
    "we begin our analysis by presenting the dependence of the average number of clusters @xmath89 on the lattice area @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath89 with increasing @xmath1 is the evidence that confirms that the extended majority - vote model exhibits heterogeneous absorbing configurations in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath11 .",
    "more to the point , we find @xmath90 for the purpose of comparison , for frozen random configurations in which the @xmath1 sites are set to @xmath14 or @xmath13 with the same probability this ratio yields @xmath91 ( and so the average number of clusters scales linearly with the lattice area too ) .",
    "we note that the reciprocal of the ratio given in eq .",
    "( [ a_f1 ] ) is the average size of the clusters : @xmath92 for the extended majority - vote model and @xmath93 for random configurations .",
    "although the mean size of a typical cluster is finite , there may be clusters whose sizes can become arbitrarily large as the lattice size increases . to investigate this point we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the average size of the largest cluster @xmath85 as function of the lattice area . as in the case of @xmath84 , the asymptotic scaling is revealed only for large lattices ( @xmath94 ) and it indicates that @xmath85 increases with @xmath95 for large @xmath0 .    in the thermodynamic limit the relevant quantity is then @xmath96 we found that @xmath85 scales with @xmath95 for random configurations also , though the ratio @xmath97 is considerably smaller than the ratio given in eq .",
    "( [ b_f1 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the standard deviation @xmath98^{1/2 } $ ] tends to the constant value @xmath99 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this amounts to a large but finite variance and so in order to satisfy the tchebycheff inequality the set of clusters whose size grows like @xmath2 must have measure zero in that limit .",
    "since the probability that a randomly chosen site belongs to one such a cluster vanishes like @xmath100 , the measure of the set of diverging clusters will be vanishingly small if its cardinality is finite , i.e. , if only a finite number of clusters have sizes scaling with @xmath101 .",
    "up to now we found no qualitative differences between the statistical properties of the clusters produced by the extended majority - vote rule or by assigning randomly the digits @xmath14 and @xmath13 to the sites of the square lattice .",
    "in fact , for both types of configurations the quantities @xmath89 and @xmath102 exhibit the same scaling behavior with the lattice area @xmath1 .",
    "however , a more detailed view of the cluster organization is given by the distribution @xmath86 of cluster sizes @xmath103 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for different lattice sizes .",
    "the data seems to be remarkably well fitted by the power - law distribution @xmath104 for over more than three decades .",
    "in addition , the figure indicates that the region where the power - law fitting holds increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this power - law distribution , however , is not compatible with our previous findings of finite values for the mean and variance of @xmath86 , since the distribution @xmath104 has infinite mean and variance .    to answer this conundrum , in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we plot the same data using a semi - logarithmic scale instead of the log - log scale of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the results show that for large lattice sizes the distribution @xmath86 is in fact exponential , the power - law behavior being valid only in an intermediate range of cluster sizes .",
    "the results for the larger lattice @xmath105 ( though not the results for the smaller lattices @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) show that the exponential distribution is not a mere cut - off inherent to the finitude of the lattices used in the simulations , as manifested by the straight - line appearance of @xmath86 revealed by the semi - log graph in the regime of large clusters . for the sake of comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we show the distribution of cluster sizes for frozen random configurations which can be well - described by the exponential distribution @xmath108 for large @xmath103 .",
    "the puzzling power - law behavior found for intermediate values of @xmath103 in the extended majority - vote model is missing in this case .    finally , it is interesting to note that , for any absorbing configuration of the extended majority - vote model , clusters of size @xmath14 are prohibited , clusters of sizes @xmath109 and @xmath16 are allowed at the sides of the square lattice only , and the only cluster of size @xmath17 allowed in the bulk of the lattice is that in which the four sites surrounding a unit cell are in the same state .",
    "in fact , this elementary square cluster is the only structure capable to propagate through the lattice , i.e. , whenever a stable cluster is formed one such elementary square is formed .",
    "a word is in order about the robustness of the heterogeneous absorbing configurations to the effect of noise , which allows the agents to oppose the opinion of the majority with some small probability .",
    "more pointedly , after applying the update rule for each agent , which may or may not result in the change of its opinion , we flip its opinion with probability @xmath110 $ ] @xcite .",
    "since in this case there are no absorbing configurations the notion of active sites is useless and so we implement the dynamics by picking lattice sites at random with the same probability",
    ". then the unit of time ( a monte carlo step ) corresponds to the update of @xmath1 randomly chosen sites . for @xmath111 we present in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] the time evolution of the fraction of sites in state @xmath14 , which we denote by @xmath33 as in sect .",
    "[ sec : mf ] , for different values of the noise parameter @xmath112 but for the same initial configuration .",
    "this figure , which exhibits the evolution of a single sample , shows the vulnerability of the heterogeneous absorbing configurations against a vanishingly amount of thermal noise if one gives enough time for thermalization .",
    "for the small values of @xmath112 considered , the steady - state is close to one of the two homogeneous configurations , with all individuals exhibiting opinion @xmath13 or opinion @xmath14 .",
    "the specific outcome is a stochastic process which depends on the choice of the initial configuration as well as on the sequence of random numbers used in the update rule .",
    "this paper is motivated by the claim that the extended majority - vote model , for which the target site counts in the reckoning of the majority , exhibits a nontrivial multicultural regime , i.e. , heterogeneous absorbing configurations @xcite . from the perspective of the statistical physics",
    ", we find this claim most intriguing , as we expect the model to behave similarly to the majority - vote models commonly considered in the physics literature , which are basically ising models with zero - temperature glauber kinetics @xcite , and so exhibit only two homogeneous absorbing configurations in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our first impression was that the heterogeneous absorbing configurations were artifacts of the small lattice size ( @xmath18 ) used or of some ` non - physical ' elements of the original model such as the nearest and next - nearest neighbors interactions ( moore neighborhood ) and the parallel update of the sites @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we have modified the original model proposed by parisi et al . by introducing the usual nearest neighbors interactions ( von neumann neighborhood ) and the random sequential update of sites .",
    "a careful finite size scaling analysis of a few relevant measures that characterize the absorbing configurations shows that the heterogeneous absorbing configurations not only persist in the thermodynamic limit but produce a tricky distribution of cluster sizes @xmath86 that decays as a power law @xmath104 for clusters of intermediate size @xmath103 and as an exponential for very large clusters sizes ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "essentially , the reason for this somewhat unexpected outcome is the criterion of update in case of a tie for a site in the bulk of the lattice : the site remains unchanged rather than flipping to another state with probability @xmath12 as usually done in statistical mechanics models @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable is that the existence of these heterogeneous absorbing configurations for the extended majority - vote model , as well as their absence in the more usual variants of that model , can actually be predicted analytically using the pair approximation : the multiple - clusters regime is signaled by the presence of an infinity of attractive fixed points of the mean - field equations .",
    "we found that the statistical properties ( e.g. , average number of clusters , mean size of the largest cluster and the asymptotic distribution of cluster sizes ) of the clusters that break up the absorbing configurations ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) are qualitatively identical to those of random configurations .",
    "this could also be inferred by the very short convergence times ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) which indicate that the absorbing configurations are very close to the initial random configurations , since a few lattice updates suffice to reach them .",
    "we are not aware of any similar study of the statistical properties of the heterogeneous configurations of axelrod s model , so we can not compare the cluster organization of these two models .",
    "our findings , which corroborate the results of parisi et al .",
    "@xcite , shows that the extended majority - vote model does exhibit a ` multicultural ' regime , despite the fact that the update rule biases the agents to become more similar to each other .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for axelrod s model as well @xcite , except that in axelrod s model the similarity is a prerequisite for interactions - the ` birds of a feather flock together ' hypothesis which states that individuals who are similar to each other are more likely to interact and then become even more similar @xcite .",
    "( a similar assumption has been used to model the interspecies interactions in spin - glass like model ecosystem @xcite . )",
    "the majority - vote model is considerably simpler and converges to the absorbing configurations much faster than axelrod s .",
    "however , the ( short ) inventory of advantages stops here : in disagreement with the claim of parisi et al .",
    "@xcite we found that the absorbing configurations of the extended majority - vote model are vulnerable to the noisy effect of flipping the opinions of the agents with some small probability .",
    "it is well - known that this type of noise destabilizes the heterogeneous configurations of axelrod s model too @xcite .",
    "of course , the extended majority - vote model lacks the main appealing feature of axelrod s model , namely , the existence of a non - equilibrium phase transition that separates the homogeneous and the polarized regimes in the thermodynamic limit . in that sense",
    "it would be interesting to find out how a similar transition could be induced in the zero - temperature majority - vote model ."
