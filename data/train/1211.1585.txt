    "currently a variety of different notions of quantumness are discussed .",
    "it is of fundamental interest to classify the nature into one part showing classical signatures , and another one dominated by quantum phenomena . in quantum optics ,",
    "the most common notion of nonclassicality is established through the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function  @xcite .",
    "if this distribution does not resemble a classical probability density , the corresponding state is called a nonclassical one  @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement is another notion of quantumness  @xcite .",
    "although each individual subsystem can be quantum , for a separable state the correlations between the subsystems can be described by classical statistics  @xcite .",
    "entanglement or inseparability can be fully characterized by negativities of optimized quasiprobability ( qp ) distributions  @xcite , denoted as @xmath1 .    in quantum information theory , a quantum - correlation ( qc )",
    "is also characterized by the so - called quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "a nonzero discord describes the back action of a measurement in one subsystem to another one .",
    "discord is often considered as a general measure of qc beyond entanglement .",
    "recently , however , it has been shown that the notions of qc based on quantum discord and on negativities of the @xmath0  function are maximally inequivalent  @xcite .",
    "the general characterization of the qcs of radiation fields has been formulated in terms of the space - time dependent @xmath0  functional  @xcite .",
    "this yields a full hierarchy of inequalities for observable correlation functions . whenever the described systems violate classical probability theory , the @xmath0  functional is a qp representation of quantum light . in the following we restrict attention to equal - time measurements , so that the @xmath0  functional simplifies to the @xmath2-partite @xmath0  function of the global quantum state @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes multimode products of coherent states .",
    "one severe disadvantage of the @xmath0  function consists in its strong singularities occurring for many quantum states , even in the single - mode case . as a consequence , in general this function is experimentally not accessible and hence of limited practical value . only in special cases",
    "the @xmath0  function is regular  @xcite and can be measured  @xcite .",
    "the concept of phase space representations has been generalized to the @xmath6-parametrized qps  @xcite .",
    "the latter include popular examples : the @xmath0  function ( @xmath7 ) , the wigner function ( @xmath8 ) , and the husimi  @xmath9  function ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "diminishing the @xmath6  parameter , the qps become more regular , but less sensitive for testing quantumness . for squeezed states ,",
    "all @xmath6-parametrized qps are either positive or irregular .",
    "especially the wigner function is popular , since it is easily obtained in experiments , e.g. for quantum light , molecules , and trapped atoms  @xcite .",
    "further generalizations of the qp methods were introduced in  @xcite .    for the single - mode case , nonclassicality qps , @xmath11 ,",
    "have been introduced  @xcite .",
    "they are regularized versions of the highly singular @xmath0  functions . for any nonclassical single - mode state ,",
    "they show negativities and can be directly obtained from experimental data  @xcite . hence @xmath11 is a powerful tool for the full experimental characterization of quantum effects of single - mode fields .    in the present paper ,",
    "we generalize the regularization of the @xmath0 function for multimode light .",
    "the resulting qp distribution , @xmath12 , uncovers any qc occurring in the multimode @xmath0  function . for practical applications it is of great importance that @xmath12 can be directly sampled from experimental data obtained by multimode homodyne detection .",
    "we show that our method uncovers qcs contained in a family of highly singular @xmath0  functions , which exhibit qc s beyond quantum discord and quantum entanglement .",

    "let us consider a realistic experimental scenario for generating a bipartite continuous variable state .",
    "the inputs of a 50:50 beam splitter are equally squeezed states in orthogonal quadratures , cf . fig .",
    "[ experiment ] . in the output ports of this setup one obtains a two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state .",
    "such states are entangled and have non - zero quantum discord .",
    ".,width=188 ]    the situation is drastically changed , if phase randomization , indicated by @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] , occurs in one of the output ports .",
    "the entanglement properties of the state depend sensitively on the dephasing  @xcite . in the case of an equally distributed phase , @xmath14 ,",
    "the resulting output state is a fully phase randomized tmsv state , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 being related to the squeezing parameter of the initial input fields .",
    "it is important to consider properties of this state which are closely related to its qcs .",
    "first , the phase randomized tmsv state is a convex mixture of the product states @xmath18 .",
    "hence , it is classical with respect to the property of entanglement .",
    "second , due to the orthogonality of the fock states , @xmath19 for @xmath20 , this state has no qcs in the sense of the quantum discord .",
    "this conclusion is obvious from the general representation of quantum states with zero discord given in  @xcite .",
    "so far our state belongs to the class of quantum states considered in  @xcite with the aim to demonstrate the inequivalence of qcs based on the @xmath0  function and the quantum discord . in our context , we require the following additional properties .",
    "third , let us consider the reduced density operator , @xmath21 .",
    "due to the symmetry of this state with respect to the interchange of both subsystems , we find that @xmath22 this state is a thermal one with a mean photon number @xmath23 . therefore it shows a classical behavior with respect to the reduced single - mode states .",
    "this property insures that any identified signature of quantumness exposes a true qc effect .",
    "fourth , the full state @xmath3 is a mixture  due to the phase randomization  of two - mode gaussian states .",
    "hence it has a non - negative wigner function , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ wigner ] .",
    "this qp distribution , which was often applied in experiments  @xcite , is improper to visualize qcs of this state by attaining negative values .    .",
    "it is non - negative in the full two - mode phase space . ]    summarizing the features of the fully phase randomized tmsv state , we have introduced an experimentally realizable quantum state with the following properties :    1 .",
    "no entanglement ; 2 .",
    "zero quantum discord ; 3 .",
    "classical reduced single - mode states ; 4 .",
    "non - negative wigner function .    despite these strong signatures of classicality",
    ", this state will be proven to show clear qc effects .",
    "it is a non - gaussian state that can be experimentally generated as outlined above . to prove that this state describes qcs",
    ", we have to visualize the negativities of its strongly singular , two - mode @xmath0  function : @xmath24 we will shown that there are qcs between the subsystems @xmath25 and @xmath26 going beyond entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "to be useful for experiments , quantumness criteria must be based on well - behaved functions .",
    "hence a regularization of the highly singular glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  representation is required .",
    "we can construct a multimode regular @xmath12 function in the form of a convolution @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a suitable function , which we are going to construct .",
    "the occurring width parameter @xmath29 provides the property @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "a direct sampling formula for measured quadrature data will be given .",
    "we start from the multimode characteristic function .",
    "the @xmath2-mode characteristic function @xmath32 is defined as the fourier transform of the @xmath0  function @xmath33 the characteristic function @xmath32 is always a continuous function , independent of singularities in @xmath34 .",
    "single - mode nonclassicality criteria based on the characteristic function have been introduced  @xcite and applied  @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath2-mode characteristic function is bounded in the form @xmath35 .",
    "the convolution in eq .   is a point - wise product in fourier space .",
    "hence , we consider the so - called multimode filtered characteristic function @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the fourier transformed of @xmath12 for @xmath38 .",
    "our choice for the filter @xmath39 is the autocorrelation function @xmath40 finally , we get the regularization kernel in eq .   by the inverse fourier",
    "transform as @xmath41    for the single - mode case , such a filter @xmath42 in eq .   has been introduced and characterized in ref .",
    "it has been shown that this filter suppresses the exponentially rising behavior of @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that this kind of filter belongs to the class of invertible filters , @xmath44 .",
    "hence , deconvolution of eq .",
    "yields the @xmath0  function , and thus the full state @xmath3 , from the qp  distribution @xmath12 .",
    "let us comment here on the structure of the regularizing function @xmath28 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : convolutionkernel ] ) . this multimode function can be written as a product of single - mode functions which do not depend on the state , the proof is given in appendix  a. a product filter is a practical tool that is sufficient to identify any kind of nonclassicality in the multimode @xmath0  function .",
    "the latter allows us directly to recognize qcs in quantum systems with classical parts .",
    "the regularizing function must not introduce any quantum - correlation to @xmath12 , which is absent in the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function . for any nonclassical state which includes some qc , there exist values @xmath29 and @xmath45 for which @xmath46 . the other way around , a state is classical , if for all values @xmath29 and @xmath45 the function @xmath47 represents a classical probability density .",
    "this means that we may identify qcs via uncorrelated filtering .",
    "for the proof of the existence of qcs in the phase randomized tmsv state , the regularized two - mode quantum - correlation qp , @xmath12 , is calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p - rand ] ) , ( [ eq : pqc - def ] ) , ( [ eq : singlemodefilter ] ) , and ( [ eq : convolutionkernel ] ) . the result in fig .",
    "[ pfil ] clearly shows that @xmath12 becomes negative for properly chosen arguments . in view of the properties of the state listed above",
    ", these negativities are a direct proof of the quantum nature of the correlations between the two subsystems @xmath25 and @xmath26 . although the wigner function in fig .",
    "[ wigner ] contains the full information on the quantum state , it does not directly visualize the qc properties of the state under study .",
    "the regular qp distribution @xmath12 , on the other hand , directly displays the qcs within the considered randomized tmsv state by attaining negative values .",
    "is shown for a fully phase randomized two - mode squeezed vacuum state , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "clear negativities visualize the nonclassical correlations of the state . ]    here the question may arise of whether the quantum correlations of the fully phase randomized tmsv state can be used in any application .",
    "the heralded control of the number of photons in an arbitrarily chosen time interval can be done with these kinds of quantum - correlated states . in our case , for sufficiently strong squeezing the control could be extended to higher photon numbers compared with the often used heralding via spontaneous parametric down conversion .",
    "more generally , even the time sequence of a train of photons could be controlled to some extend by the quantum correlations inherent in such a state .",
    "now we consider the characterization of qc for arbitrary states in a more general context .",
    "negative values of @xmath12 also include negativities which can be explained by entanglement , quantum discord , or single - mode nonclassicalities .",
    "let us outline how one can identify those particular effects in general .",
    "a nonzero quantum discord may be directly or numerically computed  @xcite . for entanglement",
    ", one can get the entanglement qp @xmath1 , e.g. for the considered phase - randomized tmsv state it is given in ref .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a nonclassical multimode @xmath0  function is necessary to describe an entangled state  @xcite .",
    "as our example shows , however , a negative @xmath12 is not sufficient to verify entanglement .    in a last step",
    ", one can try to find negativities of @xmath12 which may be given by single - mode nonclassicalities .",
    "here one has to consider the reduced states .",
    "these reduced states can be characterized by the single - mode nonclassicality qp , @xmath11 , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "more generally , one may consider @xmath2-mode states which are fully characterized by @xmath50 .",
    "tracing over some subsystems , we get a state which is described by the remaining subsystems only , e.g. : @xmath51 if the original state is quantum correlated but none of the partially traced states is quantum correlated , one may refer to this kind of correlation as genuine @xmath52mode  qc .",
    "the multimode analysis does not depend on the kind of mode decomposition of the radiation field .",
    "we may consider a two - mode scenario , a similar processing can be done in the multimode case .",
    "the individual modes may be represented by the corresponding annihilation operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , the system may be decomposed in two other modes , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "a mode transformation is given by a unitary transform @xmath57 of the form @xmath58 one can easily see that such a transformation maps a coherent state @xmath59 to @xmath60 which is also a coherent product state . hence , we conclude that @xmath61 has negativities for some @xmath29 , iff @xmath62 has negativities for some @xmath63 .",
    "note that such an equivalence is , in general , not true for the reduced state in @xmath25 and @xmath64 or @xmath26 and @xmath65 .",
    "for applications of our method , a direct sampling formula is useful which yields @xmath12 from the measured data .",
