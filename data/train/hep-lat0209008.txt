    "thermodynamic observables , such as the energy density @xmath2 , the pressure @xmath3 or the quark number susceptibility @xmath4 , approach the corresponding ideal gas values as the temperature @xmath5 ( or the chemical potential @xmath1 ) becomes very large .",
    "corrections to the ideal gas behaviour can be computed in a weak coupling approximation .",
    "such a picture of ideal or weakly interacting plasma is often used in most physical applications in heavy ion phenomenology and in cosmology of the early universe .",
    "whether the quark - gluon plasma can be described by such a simple picture in the relevant range of temperatures , say @xmath6 , is a very important issue for these applications . @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 are known to show strong deviations from the ideal gas picture in this range which can not be explained by naive perturbation theory up to @xmath7 .",
    "clever resummations of the perturbation series are thought to be a cure .",
    "one such approach @xcite successfully describes the lattice data for @xmath3 above @xmath8 .",
    "the quark number susceptibilities provide an independent test of any such resummation scheme .",
    "recent lattice results @xcite for these exhibit a strong disagreement with both the naive perturbation theory as well as the resummed @xcite one .",
    "these lattice results were obtained using staggered fermions on lattices with 4 , 6 and 8 temporal sites in a temperature range @xmath9 .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 from these calculations were extrapolated to the continuum to compare with the perturbative results .",
    "[ chit ]    as shown in figure [ chit ] , the ideal gas result , @xmath11 , for the naive staggered fermions varies strongly for @xmath0 = 4 , 6 and 8 , and deviates substantially from the continuum result , indicating the need for an improved operator for it in order to confirm the implied non - perturbative nature of the quark - gluon plasma by the results of @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath4 ( or the number density ) is obtained from @xmath12 by taking second ( or first ) derivative with respect to @xmath1 . improving it therefore needs to be done by modifying the number operator @xmath13 , which in turn is fixed by the ( baryon ) current conservation equation .",
    "following the study @xcite of improvement of the energy and pressure , we employ the naik action @xcite and the p4 action @xcite and write down @xmath13 for them from the corresponding current conservation equations .",
    "an additional complication for nonzero @xmath1 is the presence of divergences even for the ideal gas .",
    "prescriptions @xcite were proposed for the naive action to eliminate them , which were shown @xcite to satisfy a general condition .",
    "we demonstrate that the same condition can suffice for a class of improved actions as well .",
    "numerical results for the ideal gas are presented to contrast @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the corresponding continuum results .",
    "we follow the notation of ref .",

    "@xcite , the improved action for @xmath35 can thus be obtained by introducing functions @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) for @xmath38 = 1 , 2 , and 3 , which multiply the terms containing forward ( backward ) links in the time direction .",
    "the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ baryon ] ) dictate that @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) multiplies an @xmath38 time - link term .    without giving the details here ,",
    "we assert that a ) the improved action with these @xmath39 and @xmath40 does lead in general to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) divergences in the energy ( number ) density and b ) the ansatz @xmath43 , @xmath44 with @xmath45 , eliminates them .",
    "this ansatz is a natural generalization of the results in @xcite for the naive action .",
    "thus , as in the naive fermion case @xcite , @xmath46 or @xmath47 can be used for the improved action in conjunction with the above ansatz for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ chit ] compares the behaviour of the ideal gas susceptibility at @xmath48 , @xmath11 , for the naik and the p4 action with that for the naive action .",
    "the results have been obtained on lattices with an aspect ratio of 3 ( @xmath49 ) and for a fixed quark mass @xmath50 . since @xmath51 for all the allowed @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the results in figure [ chit ] are valid for all prescriptions of @xmath52 .",
    "one sees that both the improved actions result in a much milder @xmath0-dependence in @xmath11 and the results are close to continuum by @xmath54 already .",
    "interestingly , the improved action results approach the continuum result from the opposite direction as compared to the naive action .    as one switches on @xmath1 ,",
    "the susceptibilities for the improved actions continue to be close to unity on lattices with @xmath55 but they do exhibit a mild @xmath1-dependence , increasing above unity for @xmath56 . for small",
    "@xmath1 one also sees a similar pattern in the number density , @xmath57 , as seen in figure [ fg.nmt ] : the improved action results are closer to the continuum results than the naive action for @xmath58 .",
    "the results also show a mild @xmath1-dependence which may be a cause of concern for the methods which attempt to study the equation of state at @xmath1 = 0 by using a taylor expansion in @xmath1 in the simulations and could result in systematic effects in the predictions for the plasma phase .",
    "[ fg.nmt ]    [ fg.nmz ]    figure [ fg.nmz ] shows the results obtained for the number density of an ideal gas at very small temperatures by taking @xmath0 very large . on a @xmath59 lattice",
    ", the number density seems to be essentially the same for small @xmath1 for all actions , including the naive action .",
    "however , none of them has the correct continuum @xmath1-dependence .",
    "only when @xmath60 is large do they all approach the continuum .",
    "improved actions seem to be closer to the continuum result for large @xmath1 .",
    "note that even at the highest @xmath60 , @xmath61 is still only about 0.6 in fig .",
    "[ fg.nmz ] .",
    "the deviations for small @xmath60 are due to the smallness of the spatial volume .",
    "we have constructed an appropriate number density term , @xmath13 , for a set of improved actions from the current conservation equations for these actions . the naik action and the p4 action , which correspond to specific choices of values for the action parameters , are included in this set .",
    "adding @xmath62 to the action for @xmath63 , where @xmath1 is the baryon chemical potential , leads to divergences in the energy density and the number density , as for the unimproved naive action .",
    "these can be eliminated by the same condition as for the naive action , namely , @xmath64 , provided for each forward ( backward ) time link the corresponding gauge variable @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is multiplied by @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .    the quark number susceptibility and the number density for the ideal gas do approach the continuum result on smaller temporal lattices for the improved action .",
    "it would be interesting to study them in the high temperature regime of qcd .",
