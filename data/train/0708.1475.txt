    "a spontaneous polarization coexists with a long range magnetic order . in magnetoelectrics",
    "( we consider here only the linear effect ) , the polarization is induced by a magnetic field in a magnetically ordered phase @xcite . in the landau theory framework ,",
    "multiferroics which are not magnetoelectric present at least a coupling of the type p@xmath0 ( p : polarization , m : total magnetization ) while linear magnetoelectrics are characterized by terms like pm@xmath1 or lmp ( l : antiferromagnetic order parameter ) @xcite .",
    "terms like p@xmath0 are of higher degree than pm@xmath1 or lmp terms .",
    "consequently , we expect a stronger interplay between dielectric and magnetic properties in linear magnetoelectrics than in simple multiferroics ( e.g. ymno@xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "more complicated coupling terms can also characterize the magnetoelectric effect ( e.g. magnetic gradient)@xcite .",
    "these kind of terms are outside the purpose of the present contribution . in the search for materials presenting a strong coupling of magnetism and polarization , the most promising ones are multiferroics presenting linear magnetoelectric properties .",
    "these materials are scarce .",
    "thus , it is of interest to look for new magnetoelectric materials by itself .",
    "recent efforts have concentrated on two main ideas : magnetic frustration and breaking of the inversion center due to an antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "these approaches have been generated by the ideas of on one side katsura @xcite and sergienko @xcite and on the other side of mostovoy @xcite .",
    "they described in the case of non collinear magnets a possible mechanism for magnetoelectricity and polarization induced by antiferromagnetic ordering , respectively .",
    "the new mechanism proposed by katsura _",
    "_ does not involve the dzialoshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction contrary to typical magnetoelectric compound such as cr@xmath3o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "most of the recent research on multiferroics concerns centrosymmetric oxides @xcite .",
    "these materials present a breaking of the symmetry giving rise to a spontaneous polarization which may be or not reversible by application of a magnetic field .",
    "the idea of using symmetry analysis to predict magnetoelectric compounds is not new .",
    "the first reported magnetoelectric compound cr@xmath3o@xmath2 was predicted to be magnetoelectric prior to any experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "it is the same philosophy that we aim to take here .    in this article",
    ", we present a symmetry analysis of selected materials .",
    "all these materials should present magnetoelectricity based on symmetry arguments .",
    "we made a literature survey considering various magnetically ordered compounds for which neutron data were available .",
    "we made a systematic symmetry analysis of all the studied compounds ( about 50 materials ) .",
    "we present here only our investigation of selected fluorides .",
    "this choice is motivated by two reasons .",
    "the first one is that there is a need to look for other materials than oxides if we search for new materials since magnetoelectric / multiferroic materials are scarce .",
    "the second reason is that polarization can not exist in conducting materials .",
    "thus , the high charge transfer in the fluorides make them good candidates for experimental investigations .",
    "several fluorides were reported to crystallize in a polar structure .",
    "consequently , in addition to magnetoelectric properties , several fluorides are potentially ferroelectric .",
    "when this is the case , we discuss this possibility in the light of known ferroelectrics related to the material under investigation .",
    "all the compounds discussed in this article have been the subject of detailed crystallographic and magnetic studies by means of neutron diffraction .",

    "consequently , an induced polarization may appear along p@xmath28 ( p@xmath25 ) if one applies a magnetic field along z ( y ) .",
    "since this compound is centrosymmetric , it can not present a multiferroic character .",
    "the fluoride kmnfef@xmath8 presents a partial ordering of the mn and fe atoms giving rise to an enlargement of the unit cell compared to the usual tetragonal tungsten bronze type @xcite .",

    "consequently , kmnfef@xmath8 is a multiferroic material which presents a strong interplay between magnetism and polarization below t@xmath50=148k .",
    "moreover , we notice here that it would be one of the scarce ferrimagnetic compounds presenting such properties . under the application of a magnetic field below t@xmath50 along the _ c _ axis ( direction of spontaneous polarization ) should create a polarization along the _ b _ axis ( term @xmath58 ) and vice versa ( term @xmath59 )",
    ". thus it will be possible to switch the polarization direction under the application of a magnetic field .",
    "this is of high interest for technological applications .",
    "another remarkable feature is that this compound orders at 148k which is much higher than the actual compounds @xcite .",
    "in the previous fluorides , the magnetic frustration appeared in corner - sharing octahedra , which leads to a single type of interaction .",
    "p. lacorre and coworkers have been also investigating compounds like ba@xmath3ni@xmath2f@xmath62 ( n = 9 ) and ba@xmath3ni@xmath63f@xmath64 ( n = 21 ) which are members of the ba@xmath8m@xmath60f@xmath61 family @xcite . in this family",

    "all the ( hkl ) magnetic reflections do not satisfy the c - centering of the chemical cell but a primitive lattice .",
    "p. lacorre and collaborators have shown that the magnetic space group is @xmath67 where the magnetic moments lie in the _ ac _ plane .",
    "consequently , the magnetic point group of this compound below its t@xmath11 is 2/m. according to ref .",

    "this material is not multiferroic since its structure is centrosymmetric .",

    "we mean there is no competition between next nearest neighbors .",
    "below t@xmath50 , all the new magnetic reflections can be indexed in the same cell as the chemical one .",

    "we shall discuss here the common mechanism which may give rise to the magnetoelectric effect in the studied fluorides and compare it to other known magnetoelectric fluorides such as bamnf@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "but prior to this , we should stress that there is an upper bound for the magnetoelectric effect @xcite which is defined as :    @xmath73    @xmath74 and @xmath75 are respectively the permittivity of free space and the relative permittivity of the considered material . while @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the relative permeability and the permeability of free space , respectively . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the magnetoelectric effect will remain small compared to unity except possibly in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials .",
    "thus multiferroic magnetoelectric materials with ferromagnetic order are the most interesting . among the various compounds that we have investigated , kmnfef@xmath8 and ba@xmath3ni@xmath63f@xmath64 are likely to be good representatives of such materials .",
    "various mechanisms may contribute to the magnetoelectric effect . in the old literature , we can count about four different mechanisms which may participate in the magnetoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "we can consider the molecular field theory expression of a magnetic field for the magnetoelectric susceptibility .",

    "@xmath80    v represent the changes of the various tensors due to the presence of an electric field : single - ion anisotropy , g - factor , symmetric exchange and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "for the detailed expression of v , we refer the reader to the literature ( see ref .",
    "it has been shown that in the presence of an electric field the changes of the g factor are predominant at low temperature in gdalo@xmath2 compared to the changes for the other tensors but not anymore above 1.2 k ( t@xmath11=3.78 k ) @xcite .",
    "it is thus difficult to determine which parameter has the most important contribution since it depends not only on the compound but also on the temperature .",
    "the change of the anisotropy energy , exchange and g value due to the electric field have been proposed for the origin of the magnetoelectric effect in cr@xmath3o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these various mechanisms are susceptible to play a role in the magnetoelectric effect in the fluorides that we present in the previous sections .    the main difference between the various fluorides that we present is the presence of inversion symmetry .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction ( antisymmetric exchange ) is allowed only when the inversion symmetry is broken at the ligand ion mediating the exchange @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the crystal structure has inversion symmetry , the external electric field * e * induces the dm interaction .",
    "thus the dm vector can be defined as * * d**@xmath81**e**@xmath82**e**@xmath83 with * * e**@xmath83 being the unit vector connecting the two sites i and j. this is the mechanism which has been proposed to explain the magnetoelectric effect in zncr@xmath3se@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one may expect that the contribution of the dm mechanism to the magnetoelectric effect is higher for compounds which allows a spontaneous dm interaction ( i.e. not induced by the electric field * e * ) . in this perspective",
    ", we expect that the almost collinear magnetic structure of cscof@xmath5 will give rise to a negligible dm contribution to the predicted magnetoelectric effect .",
    "we note that dm interactions do not result systematically in a magnetoelectric contribution as in the case of @xmath4-fe@xmath3o@xmath2 @xcite or cof@xmath3 @xcite , which are piezomagnetic materials .",
    "the fluorides that we present in this contribution present various symmetry properties . we can classify them in two types of crystal structures : polar and non - polar . in the first category , we count kmnfef@xmath8 and ba@xmath3ni@xmath63f@xmath64 . in the other category",

    "are potentially multiferroic and thus ferroelectric at room temperature .",
    "if their ferroelectric properties can be confirmed experimentally , the mechanism for this ferroelectricity remains to be investigated .",
    "several multiferroic fluorides have been investigated theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the typical charge transfer towards empty d - orbitals responsible for ferroelectricity such as in batio@xmath2 is not active in bamf@xmath5 ( m = mn , fe , co , and ni ) . the ferroelectric instability in the multiferroic barium fluorides arises solely due to size effects @xcite . in the light of the occupied d - orbitals in kmnfef@xmath8 and ba@xmath3ni@xmath63f@xmath64 , it could be that the cooperative displacements of k@xmath10 and ba@xmath66 respectively would be responsible for the ferroelectric instability .",
    "obviously , this hypothesis remains to be confirmed experimentally .",

    "most of them present magnetic frustration .",
    "we present here possible magnetoelectrics which are among the scarce ferrimagnetic systems .",
    "this ferromagnetism may enhance the interplay between polarization and magnetism for the case of multiferroic materials .",
