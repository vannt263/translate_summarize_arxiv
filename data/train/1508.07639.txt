    "the use of cepheids as stellar candles requires a deep knowledge of their pulsational characteristics .",
    "the separation between fundamental ( @xmath1-mode ) and first - overtone ( @xmath2-mode ) radial pulsators @xcite is still the most relevant distinction to be taken into account to calibrate the period - luminosity relations . about the regularity of their variations , ground - based photometry of v473",
    "lyr @xcite and polaris @xcite showed continuous changes in amplitude and phase .",
    "@xcite established that v473  lyr pulsates in the second radial overtone and shows strong amplitude and phase modulations on two long periods ( 1205@xmath33 and 5300@xmath3150  d ) .",
    "the slow changes in the light curve of polaris on a time baseline of 4.5  yr were precisely recorded by space photometry using the _ coriolis _ spacecraft .",
    "@xcite connected them to a quite fast evolutionary phase .",
    "however , @xcite proposed a different interpretation pointing out how the amplitude change is cyclic rather than monotonic and also suggesting an excess of power in the 2 - 6  d range due to the granulation .",
    "the situation was expected to change with the advent of high - precision space mission . a detailed analysis of the _ most _ observations of sz  tau and rt  aur revealed variations from cycle to cycle as a function of the pulsation phase @xcite .",
    "the stars were both monitored for less than seven consecutive cycles : the @xmath2-cepheid sz tau showed a pulsation less stable than the @xmath1-cepheid rt aur .",
    "the historical analysis of the times of maximum brightness proved that both stars experienced period variations on a time - scale of decades and that those of the overtone mode resulted to be more erratic than the @xmath4 ones .    in the case of _ kepler",
    "_ , there was only one cepheid in the field - of - view , i.e. , v1154  cyg .",
    "@xcite provided a very detailed analysis of the data acquired in the first 600  d ( i.e. , about 120 cycles ) of the mission , detecting significant cycle - to - cycle fluctuations .",
    "a very slight correlation was also found between the fourier parameters and the o - c values , i.e. , the difference between the _ observed _ and _ calculated _ times of maximum brightness ( t@xmath5 ) .",
    "this suggested that the o - c variations ( up to 30  min ) might be due to instabilities in the light curve shape .",
    "on the basis of these observational results , @xcite suggested that convection and hot spots can explain the observed period jitter , thus supporting the @xcite interpretation of the polaris changes .",
    "the clues about the changes in the light curve of v1154  cyg were strengthened by the analysis of new _ kepler _ measurements ( up to q17 quarter ) : the analysis of the fourier parameters supplied a robust determination of a periodicity of 158.6  d @xcite .    about ground - based observations , @xcite discovered significant modulations in the radial velocity curves of some cepheids .",
    "these modulations appear to be different from those reported on v1154  cyg , since they manifest as shape and amplitude variations on time - scales of years for short - period cepheids ( like v1154 cyg ) and cycle - to - cycle variations in the long - period cepheids .",
    "a common result among all these investigations is that no nonradial mode was identified in the light or radial velocity curves of galactic cepheids .",
    "hence the counterparts of the subclasses detected in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are still missing .",
    "however , an important player has not yet contributed , i.e. , the corot data base of the light curves collected in the exoplanetary fields .",
    "such data base already proved to be a real treasure allowing the discovery of a unique triple - mode cepheid in the outskirts of the milky way @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the new elements brought by the corot photometry to the hot topic of the stability of the cepheid light curves .",
    "the first new cepheid discovered by corot was 2mass j06415168 - 0120059@xmath6corot  0102618121 , a 12@xmath7-mag star located at @xmath8 = @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 , @xmath12 = 012005 ( j2000 ) .",
    "it was observed during the first long run in the anticentre direction ( lra01 ) and then in the lra06 four years later ( table  [ runs ] ) .",
    "the classification of the type of variability was a little troublesome .",
    "the star was assigned to the rr lyr working group , but the preliminary analysis immediately pointed out that the star was not a rr  lyr variable since the period was too long .",
    "the cepheid variability was much more probable , but some doubts still remained , based on the classification as m1v type reported in the header of the fits file of the lra01 data .",
    "indeed , the  corot variability classifier \" automated supervised method ( cvc ; * ? ? ? * ) suggested an active , rotational variable as first hypothesis and a classical cepheid as a second one .",
    "the spectral classification of corot  0102618121 was revised as a5v in the current version of the exo - dat @xcite catalogue and consequently reported in the header of the more recent lra06 data .    while the analysis of corot  0102618121 was in progress , we proposed known cepheids as corot targets by answering the announcements of opportunity regularly issued before any run .",
    "in such a way v376 mon@xmath6corot  0300003751 and dp  mon@xmath6corot 0221644967 were monitored in the lra02 and sra02 runs , respectively ( table  [ runs ] ) .",
    "however , it should be expected that other cepheids would be discovered thanks to the deep survey performed by corot on the galactic plane .    to search for these new cepheids , we first scrutinized all the new variables discovered with the berlin exoplanet search telescope ( best ) that have been classified as candidate cepheids @xcite and actually observed with corot .",
    "we noticed that the variability of v376  mon was recorded @xcite with the correct period , i.e. , 1.652  d @xcite , not the 0.623  d reported in the discovery paper @xcite .",
    "unfortunately none of other best candidates were confirmed as a new cepheid , since they turned out to be rotational variables .",
    "the misclassification is probably due to the too relaxed criterion used to classify a new variable as cepheid , i.e. , a periodic variability with an amplitude larger than 0.10  mag .",
    "indeed , such an amplitude threshold can be reached by active spotted stars .    as a second step in the data mining of the corot data base , we selected all the variables for which the cvc method proposed a classification as cepheid , independently from rank and probability .",
    "the full light curves of about 250 candidates thus selected were inspected by eye .",
    "eclipsing variables , rr  lyr and high - amplitude @xmath12 sct stars were found and not considered furthermore .",
    "we remained with a sample where the dichotomy was again between cepheid and rotational variables .",
    "the stars characterized by very large cycle - to - cycle variations were immediately considered as rotational variables .",
    "the stars showing more stable light curves were analysed in frequency and least - squares solutions of the mean light curves were obtained .",
    "we note that in this process the small amplitude was not considered as a rule of thumb since it could be reduced by an unresolved , blended star . on the other hand , a large amplitude ( say , greater than 0.20  mag )",
    "was recognized as the signature of a pulsational mechanism .",
    "most of the stars were considered as rotational variables after that an ensemble of several parameters ( period , amplitude , stability of the light - curve shape , fourier parameters ,  ... ) was taken into account .",
    "however , we can not rule out that a few of them are actually cepheids , whose regular curve is perturbed by that of a blended irregular variable .",
    "we could identify some borderline cases ( e.g. corot 0102635101 , 0102640143 , 0605539616 , 0223971984 , 0102578739 , 0110827792 , and , overall , 0223971984 ) where the distinction between activity and pulsation was very difficult .",
    "new spectroscopic observations are necessary to establish the nature of these problematic stars in an unambiguous way .    during the screening procedure we discovered the unique galactic triple - mode cepheid corot 0223989566 @xcite and at the end we could count seven bona - fide cepheids .",
    "in addition to corot  0102618121 , v376  mon , and dp  mon we identified four new cepheids : corot  0221640090 , 0315221415 , 0211626074 , and 0659466327 ( table  [ runs ] ) .",
    "the corot photometry of v376  mon and of other cepheids was analysed when the interpretation of the corot  0102618121 data was almost finished .",

    "to solve the ambiguous spectral classification of corot  0102618121 and to validate our classification criteria , we obtained three high - resolution spectra on 2012 january 10 and 11 with the harps spectrograph installed at the 3.6-m telescope of the eso - la silla observatory .",
    "the spectra were taken in the high - efficiency eggs configuration ( r=80,000 ) and they have signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) between 50 and 55 .",
    "we reduced and normalized the spectra with a semi - automated pipeline developed at the brera observatory @xcite .",
    "we then computed the mean line profiles for each spectrum using the lsd software @xcite and we used them to estimate the radial ( from 47.9 to 53.6  kms@xmath13 ) and projected rotational ( from 9.64 to 11.85  kms@xmath13 ) velocities by fitting the profiles with gaussians .",
    "the reduced and normalized spectra were shifted by their radial velocities and averaged in order to lessen the effect of the pulsation . the spectral synthesis software sme version 4.2.3 @xcite was used to estimate the physical parameters .",
    "the spectral regions 5160 - 5190   ( including the gravity sensitive mg - triplet ) and 4830 - 4900  ( the h@xmath14 region , sensitive to the temperature ) were selected .",
    "we left temperature ( @xmath15 ) , gravity ( @xmath16 , cgs units ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , micro- and macroturbulence as free parameters , while @xmath17kms@xmath13 was imposed .",
    "following @xcite , we also left the abundances of na , si , ti , fe , and ni as free parameters . we performed an iterative process on the marcs stellar models @xcite : we started running the sme software on the mg region , then we switched to the h@xmath14 region keeping the @xmath16 previously found as a fixed parameter .",
    "after that we went back to the mg region keeping fixed the @xmath15 value found in the h@xmath14 region , and so on until the results converged .",
    "the resulting parameters are @xmath15= 6087@xmath344k , @xmath16=1.53@xmath30.15  dex , [ fe / h]=@xmath18  dex .",
    "they confirm that corot  0102618121 is a pop .",
    "i supergiant and not a main - sequence star : its classification as a cepheid variable was definitely established .",
    "the original timeseries of corot  0102618121 consist of 348  702 and 206  528 data points , respectively . in both cases the exposure time was set to 32  s ( corresponding to the corot short cadence ) and the flux was recorded in three different spectral regions , i.e. , in the corot chromatic mode .",
    "the contamination factors ( in a scale ranging from 0 to 1 ) are 0.026 and 0.036 in the two corot runs , suggesting no relevant contribution from back- or fore - ground stars .",
    "the analysis of the original n2 data clearly detected a predominant peak at @xmath19=0.3574  d@xmath13 followed by several harmonics .",
    "figure  [ lruns ] shows lra01 ( top panel of the upper part ) and lra06 ( top panel of the lower part ) corot n2 data on a 15-d time baseline .",
    "all data points are plotted , including those acquired during the crossing of the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) : they appear as bright outliers on a vertical line .",
    "we avoided any cleaning procedure since the detection of instrumental trends and jumps and their subsequent correction is a crucial step to proceed in the analysis of the corot data .",
    "therefore , we computed a preliminary solution based on the set of frequencies @xmath19 , 2@xmath19 , 3@xmath19 , 4@xmath19 , and 5@xmath19 . the plots of the residuals ( middle panels of the two parts of fig .",
    "[ lruns ] ) show sudden jumps around jd 2454468 in lra01 and jd 2456003 in lra06 , the saa outliers , and continuous oscillations .",
    "outliers were iteratively removed at this stage .",
    "we still remained with the necessity to correct the sudden jumps and long - term drifts and to verify the origin of the residual oscillations . to do this",
    ", we applied the least - squares fits to each pulsation cycle , still using the set of frequencies from @xmath19 to 5@xmath19 .",
    "the 32-s cadence of the corot data warranted more than 7000  measurements for each cycle , making the solution very robust .",
    "this procedure returned the mean fluxes of the 47 cycles observed in the lra01 and the 27 ones in lra06 ( fig .",
    "[ lruns ] , bottom panels of the two parts ) .",
    "these mean values show the variations due to the jumps and the long - term trend .",
    "we notice that the long - term trends behave in different ways in the two runs .",
    "the effect of the jump around jd  2454468 was noticeable in the data until jd  2454485 , thus affecting the mean magnitudes of the subsequent six cycles . to remove the instrumental variations , we interpolated the values of the mean fluxes ( bottom panels of fig.[lruns ] ) at the times of each individual measurement and then we subtracted it .",
    "at this point two cleaned timeseries ( 326,634 and 196,032 points , respectively ) were ready to be analysed in frequency . by applying this procedure",
    "we probably modified any possible additional signal around 2.8  d and this fact has to be carefully considered when discussing the frequency content of the light curves of the two runs .",
    "we transformed the fluxes into magnitudes by calculating the average flux of each run .",
    "we also measured the level of the noise of the corot timeseries after subtracting the set of the @xmath19 frequency and harmonics . in the case of the lra01 data we obtained 0.065  mmag in the 0.01 - 1.0  d@xmath13 range , rapidly decreasing to 0.018  mmag in the 1.0 - 2.0  d@xmath13 region , and more slowly to 0.012  mmag in the 2.1 - 3.0  d@xmath13 region and to 0.007  mmag around 5.0  d@xmath13 . in the case of the lra06 data the four values are 0.104 , 0.030 , 0.020 , and 0.010  mmag , respectively .",
    "the number of measurements ( 326,634 versus 196,032 ) accounts for most of the difference between the noise levels of the lra01 and lra06 spectra .",
    "the frequency analysis was performed by means of the iterative sine - wave , least - squares fitting method @xcite and then refined with the mtrap algorithm @xcite , allowing us to include all the significant harmonics in the search for the best fit around @xmath19 .",
    "the best way to illustrate our final results is to follow the chronological order of their progressive consolidation .",
    "the analysis of the lra01 data in white light was concluded in 2011 and the results were apparently very promising .",
    "we found the harmonics up to 6@xmath19 ( amplitude 0.13  mmag ) , flanked by some modulation terms at @xmath30.007  d@xmath13 ( i.e. , 142  d ) . since the separation is very close to the length of the observations , the origin of these terms has to be ascribed to a residual , still imperfect correction of the instrumental drifts .",
    "moreover , a few peaks not very close to @xmath19 and 2@xmath19 were detected : 0.488  d@xmath13 ( amplitude 0.40 mmag ) , 0.392  d@xmath13 ( 0.14  mmag ) , and 0.288  d@xmath13 ( 0.15  mmag ) .",
    "only the peak at 0.488  d@xmath13 had a s / n above the threshold considered as the significativity one in the fourier analysis ( s / n=4.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , s / n=0.396/0.065=6.1 . the power spectra illustrating the bunch of low amplitude peaks still centred around @xmath19 , the 0.488-d@xmath13 peak , and the 6@xmath19 harmonic are shown in the top panel of fig .  [ spectrares ] . however , the identification of the 0.488  d@xmath13 peak as an additional mode was not really convincing because no combination term was observed .",
    "why this non - detection is so important ?",
    "the combination or coupling terms are generally ascribed to the non - linear responses of the stellar atmospheres to the strong radial pulsations .",
    "the frequency analysis of the light curves of double - mode cepheids show several of them , also involving harmonics of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 radial modes @xcite .",
    "the fourier decomposition of the light curves also shows regularities in the distribution of the phase parameters that are not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "the combination terms have been detected in the light curves of other multimode pulsators , e.g. hads stars @xcite , rr  lyr stars @xcite , and white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the corot photometry also allowed us to detect low - amplitude , nonradial modes in an hads star pulsating in a single radial mode and also in this case a lot of combination terms were detected @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should expect combination terms when additional modes , both radial and nonradial , are excited in a high - amplitude radial pulsator .",
    "the uncertainties on the real significativity of the peaks detected in the lra01 data slowed down our theoretical analysis and made us unsure of how to proceed further .",
    "the re - observation of the same field in the lra06 pointing supplied us with new data to verify the frequency content of corot  0102618121 .",
    "we applied the same procedure used for the lra01 data to remove the content of the main variation .",
    "the frequency analysis of the residuals of the lra06 data confirmed the presence of the 0.488  d@xmath13 peak ( fig .",
    "[ spectrares ] , bottom panel of the upper part ) .",
    "therefore , the confidence on the stellar origin of the 0.488  d@xmath13 grew .",
    "however , the ratio 0.357/0.488=0.732 would be quite unusual for a double - mode cepheid with a normal metallic content , both from observational data @xcite and theoretical models @xcite .",
    "therefore , such a ratio pointed out a possible nonradial mode .",
    "the identification of the peak as the rotational frequency is much more unlikely , since the corresponding rotational period ( 2.06  d ) appears too short for a supergiant star .",
    "the excitation of nonradial modes in a classical cepheid would be a very important ingredient in the modelling of the atmospheres of these supergiant stars , thus we submitted this result to further checks . at this stage",
    ", we detected the 0.488  d@xmath13 peak in the residuals of each long run .",
    "these sets of residuals were obtained by applying a global fit to the lra01 data ( grey points in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ curveres ] ) and to the lra06 ones ( grey points in the lower panel of fig .  [ curveres ] ) .",
    "indeed , variations in the shape of the residuals are clearly visible , especially after the jumps at jd  2454468 and jd  2456003 .",
    "they remind the oscillations noticed before removing the long - term trends and the jumps ( fig .",
    "[ lruns ] , middle panels ) .",
    "this suggested that the computation of the mean fluxes was very effective in cleaning the power spectra , but the interplay betweeen the large amplitude of corot  0102618121 and the jump correction could somehow leave spurious variability close to the significance level .",
    "for this reason we gave a closer look to the light curves of the residuals from which the 0.488  d@xmath13 peak was detected .",
    "these light curves show the same type of oscillations , suggesting that the global solution was not able to match the instrumental alterations of the stellar signal .",
    "thus we decided to calculate residuals following the same approach used to determine the mean fluxes .",
    "this implied to compute as many sets of parameters as the elapsed cycles were , i.e. , 47 for lra01 and 27 for lra06 .",
    "the analysis of these new sets of residuals were enlightening .",
    "the oscillations visible in fig .",
    "[ lruns ] ( middle panels ) had completely disappeared and the light curves became really flat , with just some clues of high - frequency noise ( fig .",
    "[ curveres ] , black points ) . indeed ,",
    "the power spectra of the residuals from fitting one cycle at a time show the peak at the 6@xmath19 harmonic only .",
    "this was observed both in the lra01 data and in the lra06 data ( lower part of fig .",
    "[ spectrares ] ) .",
    "both spectra are characterized by an almost white noise .",
    "it could be argued that the signal at 0.488  d@xmath13 was removed when fitting the single cycles ( also taking into account the almost exact 3/4 ratio between the frequencies ) .",
    "however , the fact that the 6@xmath19 peak has remained clearly visible gave evidence that the fit with @xmath19 , 2@xmath19 , 3@xmath19 , 4@xmath19 , and 5@xmath19 of each cycle did not modified any signal component apart from these frequencies .",
    "we tried to come back to a new correction of the mean fluxes , but again the analysis of the global residuals thus obtained was unsatisfactory .",
    "we note that the technique of analysing single cycles were successfully applied to remove similar instrumental effects in the light curves of the high - amplitude @xmath12 sct star corot  101155310 @xcite and of the triple - mode cepheid corot 0223989566 @xcite .",

    "we determined the observed t@xmath5 s by means of cubic spline functions with a non - zero smoothing parameter that depends on the number of measurements to fit and on their scatter @xcite .",
    "we thus obtained the linear ephemeris from the least - squares method @xmath25 + ( e@xmath26 ) and hence we could calculate the o - c value for each t@xmath5 .",

    "we also estimated the uncertainty on the individual t@xmath5 determination as the difference between the two times corresponding to the intersection of the spline function with the line @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ spline ] ) , where @xmath28 is the magnitude at maximum and @xmath24 is the standard deviation of the fit .",
    "such uncertainties are ranging from 0.010 to 0.016  d and hence the 3@xmath24 interval ( i.e. , 22.5  min ) matches the individual error bars , too .",
    "we analysed in frequency the o - c values too , again obtaining no clear indication of periodicities .    as a final conclusion , looking at the different plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fourier ] and at the results of the various frequency analyses , we can not identify any additional periodicity in the variability of corot  0102618121 .",
    "the fourier parameters and the o - c values sometimes mimic an apparent regular behaviour",
    ". this could be a hint of cycle - to - cycle variations , much less regular than those observed in the _ kepler _ light curve of v1154  cyg @xcite .",
    "we merged the lra01 and lra06 measurements and we calculated a refined value of the period on the whole time baseline .",
    "the mtrap code supplied the final vale @xmath29=2.7980596@xmath30.0000001  d , in excellent agreement with the value obtained from the t@xmath5 s values only .",
    "the most relevant difference in the datasets of the two long runs is a slight increase from 0.222 to 0.233  mag in the full - amplitude of the light curves .",
    "since we are dealing with absolute photometry , i.e. , without any comparison star , we have to be sure that the measurements were performed in the same instrumental system to infer that the amplitude difference has a stellar origin .",
    "we immediately noticed that the star was observed in the same ccd in the two runs , but with a different mask and at different pixel coordinates .",
    "as a results , the average white flux measured was of 1  030  069  electrons in lra01 and 944,911  electrons in lra06 .",
    "moreover , the flux subdvision in @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 colours was also different : 65 , 14 , 21 per cent in lra01 , 78 , 10 , 12 per cent in lra06 . we conclude that the small difference in amplitude could very probably be ascribed to the different settings of the corot pointings in the two runs .",
    "the same effect occurs in _ kepler _ photometry : average fluxes and amplitudes change for the same star observed in the same ccd but with different masks .",
    "these effects are particularly disturbing when dealing with large amplitude variables @xcite .",
    "the procedure applied to white light measurements was repeated for each colour of both runs . other similar , subtle instrumental effects became evident during this process @xcite .",

    "therefore , we performed some additional tests on the folded light curves , evaluating the standard deviations as a function of phase bins .",
    "tiny increases of the standard deviations were measured in correspondence of the most rapid light variation ( i.e. , on the steep ascending branch ) ; they mostly reflect the variability due to the pulsation within the phase bins , as proven by the fact that they appear to be more relevant for the stars showing the largest amplitudes and the most asymmetrical light curves .",
    "this suggests that the standard deviations of the phase bins on the rising branch can not be used as a tool to search for cycle - to - cycle variations .",
    "we can conclude that in the case of the seven corot cepheids , the cycle - to - cycle variability is very limited and not greatly affecting the repetitivity of the light curves .",
    "the light variations observed around the maxima of sz tau are more promising , but on this context the low - frequency peaks in the power spectrum have to be carefully considered : the residuals observed in _ most _ photometry are very similar to the spurious ones detected in corot one ( fig .",

    "<S> once that the instrumental effects were properly removed , no additional mode was detected . </S>",
