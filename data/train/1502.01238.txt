    "this work concerns the inverse scattering problem of recovering an impenetrable obstacle by the corresponding acoustic wave detection .",
    "the problem has its physical origin in radar / sonar , geophical exploration , non - destructive testing and medical imaging ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . let @xmath2 be a bounded lipschitz domain in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , such that @xmath3 is connected .",
    "@xmath2 represents an impenetrable obstacle located in the space and it is assumed to be unknown / inaccessible . in order to identify @xmath2 , one sends a time - harmonic detecting plane wave of the form @xmath4 which is an entire solution to the helmholtz equation @xmath5 in @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of the obstacle @xmath2 interrupts the propagation of the plane wave , leading to the so - called scattered wave field @xmath6 , which exists only in the exterior of the obstacle .",
    "the total wave field @xmath7 satisfies the following helmholtz system @xmath8 in , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , with @xmath11 denoting the exterior unit normal vector to @xmath12 , corresponding to that @xmath2 is sound - soft or sound - hard , respectively . in the following , we set @xmath13 and @xmath14 , denoting the wavenumber and incident direction of the plane wave , respectively .",
    "the pde system is well - understood with @xmath15 possessing the following asymptotic expansion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 which holds uniformly in @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is known as the far - field pattern and we shall write @xmath21 to specify its dependence on the observation direction @xmath22 , wavenumber @xmath23 and incident direction @xmath24 , as well as the obstacle @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath20 is real - analytic in @xmath22 , and hence if it is known on any open patch of @xmath25 , then it is known on the whole sphere by the analytic continuation ; see @xcite .",
    "the inverse problem that we are concerned with in the present paper is to recover @xmath2 by knowledge of @xmath26 , which is known to be nonlinear and ill - posed ( cf .",
    "it is noted that the inverse problem is formally posed with a fixed @xmath27 and all @xmath28 .",
    "hence , there is a widespread belief that one can recover @xmath2 by using the far - field pattern corresponding to a single incident plane wave @xmath29 , which is referred to as a single far - field measurement .",
    "however , this still remains to be a longstanding problem with very limited progresses in the literature .",
    "if the obstacle is of small size ; roughly speaking , smaller than half of the detecting wavelength , the unique recovery result was established in @xcite .",
    "if the obstacle is extremely  rough \" in the sense that its boundary is nowhere analytic , the unique recovery result was established in @xcite .",
    "if the obstacle is of general polyhedral type , the corresponding study is almost exclusive @xcite .",
    "recently , some qualitative numerical schemes of recovering the obstacles by a single far - field measurement were proposed in @xcite , where certain restrictive a priori assumptions have to be imposed on the obstacles .",
    "another challenging issue in the study of inverse scattering problems is the recovery by phaseless data , say the modulus of the far - field pattern , @xmath30 .",
    "the only recent result we are aware of is @xcite , where the unique determination of a scattering potential by the phaseless far - field measurements was established .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a novel scheme of recovering a polyhedral obstacle by using only a few high - frequency far - field measurements .",
    "the obstacle could be sound - soft or sound - hard .",
    "the crux is the observation that the modulus of the far - field pattern in the backscattering aperture possesses a certain local maximum behavior , from which one can determine the exterior normal directions of the front sides / faces . then by using the modulus of the backscattering data corresponding a few incident plane waves with suitably chosen incident directions , one can determine the exterior unit normal vector of each side / face of the obstacle .",
    "after the determination of the exterior unit normals , the recovery is reduced to a finite - dimensional problem of determining a location point of the obstacle and the distance of each side / face away from the location point . for the latter reconstruction , the far - field data with phases would be used .",
    "our study is based on the high - frequency asymptotics , namely the kirchhoff or the physical optics approximation .",
    "however , our numerical experiments show that the high - frequency requirement could be relaxed to a certain extent .",
    "moreover , in order to simplify the discussion , we focus on convex polyhedral obstacles in the present study .",
    "however , through our theoretical arguments , it can be expected that the method developed would work for non - convex obstacles , but under certain geometrical constraints .",
    "we focus on developing the novel inverse scattering scheme for convex obstacles in the present study and leave the technical and tedious derivation of the geometrical conditions for non - convex obstacles for a forthcoming work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we consider the physical optics approximation on the high - frequency scattering from an admissible polyhedral obstacle , and derive the local maximum behavior of the modulus of the corresponding far - field pattern . in section 3",
    ", we present the recovery scheme in detail .",
    "section 4 is devoted to numerical experiments to validate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method and the paper is concluded in section 5 with some discussion .",
    "throughout the present section , we let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be fixed . let @xmath2 be a convex polygon in @xmath33 or a convex polyhedron in @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 where each @xmath36 represents an open side / face of @xmath12 , and shall be referred to as a _ cell _ in what follows . in the sequel , @xmath2",

    "the exterior unit normal direction can thus be determined by connecting the arrow heads of incident and critical observation directions by yellow lines . those unit vector ( green arrows ) parallel to the yellow lines are the desired normal directions of those sides of the triangular obstacle in the backscattering aperture as shown in fig .",

    "we shall present a rigorous mathematical justification for this local maximum behavior , which also forms the basis of our subsequent recovery scheme .",
    "we first give some discussion on the kirchhoff or the physical optics approximation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which plays a key role in our recovery scheme . considering the present study",
    ", it says that for the scattering from a convex polyhedral obstacle due to a high - frequency plane wave , the wave field near the boundary of the obstacle is composed of two parts : the contribution of the incident and reflected waves where they are present , and the contribution of the diffraction due to the corners and/or the edges of the obstacle .",
    "the kirchhoff or the physical optics approximation takes the first contribution as the total wave field near the boundary of the obstacle .",
