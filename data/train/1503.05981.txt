    "understanding the role and significance of dark matter in the evolution of baryonic components ( i.e. , conversion of the gaseous disk into stars ) is a critical aspect for realistic models of galaxy evolution .",
    "observational studies aimed at addressing the influence of dark matter in galaxy formation and evolution often use mass decompostion to constrain the distribution of dark matter .",
    "many of these projects utilize neutral hydrogen ( hi ) synthesis observations to derive the kinematics for rotation curve decompostion ( i.e. , the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) ; @xcite , westerbork survey of hi in spiral galaxies ( whisp ) ; @xcite ) . in this paper , we take advantage of the well - behaved outer disk kinematics in the galaxy ngc5005 to perform a mass decomposition analysis .",
    "we use radio synthesis observations of hi and co to probe both the gas surface density and dynamics as the gas follows the gravitational potential of the galaxy . the stellar contribution to the overall mass budget of the galaxy",
    "is determined from deep near - infrared ( nir ) observations .",
    "finally , we use optical broadband b and r and narrowband h@xmath1 observations to supplement the nir and radio synthesis data to provide information about the dominant stellar populations and star formation activity .",
    "large projects like things and whisp have provided a foundation for numerous other studies investigating gas kinematics and morphology ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and dark matter haloes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , an examination of the statistical significance of connections between the dark matter and baryonic properties of these galaxies may be biased due to the representative nature of the samples . in an effort to address fundamental questions regarding the growth and distribution of stellar disks in dark matter haloes in a statistical manner",
    ", we have undertaken a project correlating structural properties and star formation activity with the dark matter properties of the host galaxy .",
    "the project uses a statistical sample of 45 nearby galaxies and builds on existing data obtained as part of the extended disk galaxy exploration science ( edges ) survey ( @xcite ) , which includes deep _ spitzer space telescope _ imaging observations .",
    "the statistical sub - sample consists of all galaxies in the edges survey that are optimally suited for rotation curve decomposition , based primarily on the limited range of inclination angles that yield both accurate rotation curves and surface density profiles .",
    "our combination of optical , nir , and radio synthesis observations will enable a comprehensive statistical analysis of the evolution of galactic disks as a function of baryonic mass , environment , and dark matter mass .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our efforts on a single galaxy from the sample , ngc5005 . this sab(rs)bc type galaxy has been studied extensively in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is known to host a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) in its center ( @xcite ) and has been classified as a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah)-dominated mid - infrared spectrum by @xcite .",
    "the morphology of ngc5005 as viewed in the infrared and optical features a strong bulge with boxy isophotes ( @xcite ) and a complicated dust morphology with no coherent structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence of a fairly weak , round bar which is nearly aligned with the major axis of the galaxy . despite the weakness of the bar , @xcite found that it could still be responsible for creating shocks visible in the central molecular gas velocity field .",
    "the molecular gas dynamics in ngc5005 were studied in more detail by @xcite .",
    "their observations reveal co emission from the nucleus , a ring at about 3 kpc , and a stream of gas northwest of the nucleus .",
    "the s - shape in the nuclear velocity field in @xcite is a signature of non - circular gas motions . @xcite",
    "cite a stellar bar of length @xmath25 kpc as being accountable for infalling gas seen as the northwest stream and for creating the 3 kpc ring which may form at the ultraharmonic resonance of the bar or alternatively constitute a pair of spiral arms that originate at the bar s ends .",
    "a position - velocity cut along the major axis of ngc5005 reveals a steep rise in the rotational velocity of the co emission ( their figure 5 ) .",
    "the rotational velocity rises to approximately 300 km s@xmath3 within the central 10 .",
    "ngc5005 lies in a relatively populated environment that is near the ursa major cluster .",

    "the two galaxies are separated by a projected distance of approximately 41  ( @xmath2200 kpc at 16.5 mpc ) and are at similar redshifts .",
    "there are no clear signs of any interaction between the galaxy pair .",
    "there are two dwarf galaxies , sdss j131115.77 + 365911.4 and sdss j131051.05 + 365623.4 , that are within 10  of ngc5005 and also lie at similar redshifts .",

    "the central hole in hi column density makes it difficult to extract trustworthy total gas surface density measurements from the vla data alone .",
    "therefore , archival co data from the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ) ( @xcite ) was acquired to supplement the hi observations of ngc5005 .",

    "a complete analysis of the complex molecular gas dynamics in ngc5005 can be found in @xcite .",
    "we obtained an h@xmath1 velocity field for the central region of ngc5005 using the sparsepak ifu ( @xcite ) on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope .",

    "observations were acquired on the night of 26 april 2014 during reasonably clear , but non - photometric weather with good seeing .",
    "we used the sta1 ccd binned 4 @xmath12 3 with the 316@xmath2063.4 grating in eighth order , centered at 6686   to cover a wavelength range from 6480    to 6890   .",
    "this resulted in a velocity resolution of 13.9 km s@xmath3 pixel@xmath3 , which is sufficient to derive an accurate velocity field for ngc5005 .    for simplicity",
    ", the sparsepak array was aligned on the sky with a position angle of 0 .",
    "we used a three pointing dither pattern to spatially fill in gaps between fibers .",
    "we took three exposures at 900 s for each dither pointing in order to be able to detect diffuse ionized gas , not just star forming regions .",
    "additional observations of blank sky were also taken to remove sky line contamination more accurately , as ngc5005 is much more extended than the sparsepak field - of - view ( see figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the sparsepak data was processed using standard tasks in the hydra package within iraf .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted and flattened , and the iraf task dohydra was used to fit and extract apertures from the ifu data . the spectra were wavelength calibrated using a wavelength solution created from thar lamp observations .",
    "the three exposures for each dither pointing were cleaned of cosmic rays .",
    "the individual images were sky subtracted using the separate sky pointing scaled to the strength of the 6577    sky line , which is close to the redshifted h@xmath1 and [ nii ] @xmath216584 lines in some locations .",
    "the cleaned , sky subtracted images were averaged together to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and then flux calibrated using observations of spectrophotometric standards from @xcite .",
    "we illustrate representative spectra from four sparsepak fibers in the central region of ngc5005 in figure [ spectra ] to demonstrate the types of spectral emission found in ngc5005 .",
    "the locations of these fibers start in the central nucleus of ngc5005 and move out towards the northwest just off the minor axis ( see the rotated h@xmath1 image on the right ) .",
    "while our primary analysis relies on cross - correlation of the entire spectrum , we also fit gaussian profiles to emission lines of h@xmath1 , [ nii ] , and [ sii ] in all the spectra to estimate the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) values and the emission line ratios .",
    "as seen previously ( @xcite ) the strength of the [ nii ] @xmath216584 line emission relative to h@xmath1 in the central fiber ( + 000 + 000 ) implies non - thermal emission processes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the broadness of the nuclear emission lines from the center of ngc5005 are suggestive that the nucleus is accretion powered ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find an approximate fwhm of 900@xmath5200 km s@xmath3 based on single gaussian fits to [ nii ] and [ sii ] lines within the central 5  fiber . the second spectrum in figure [ spectra ] ( -005 + 003 )",
    "was extracted from the adjacent fiber to the northwest of the central fiber .",
    "this spectrum displays double - peaked emission lines that suggests either infalling or outflowing gas .",
    "indeed , this fiber is placed near where @xcite detected infalling molecular gas in their co observations of ngc5005 .",
    "the third fiber s spectrum ( -010 + 006 ) still shows broad emission lines with non - thermal line strengths , but less so in both aspects than the central fiber",
    ". this spectra is representative of diffuse ionized gas emission in ngc5005 , which we measure to have typical fwhms of about 140@xmath510 km s@xmath3 and [ nii ] @xmath216584/h@xmath1 line ratios of 3.0@xmath51.2 , which is consistent with non - thermal or shock excited gas .",
    "the fourth fiber s spectrum ( -015 + 008 ) shown in the bottom panel of figure [ spectra ] is placed on the ring of h@xmath1 emission surrounding the nucleus .",
    "this spectrum displays narrower line widths and stronger h@xmath1 to [ nii ] @xmath216584 line emission strengths .",
    "we find typical fwhms of approximately 80@xmath55 km s@xmath3 and [ nii ] @xmath216584/h@xmath1 ratios of 0.4@xmath50.1 in similar spectra , which are indicative of primarily thermal emission processes most likely due to recent star formation activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "inspection of spectra extracted from a few other fibers revealed additional locations with double - peaked emission lines , similar to the -005 + 003 fiber spectrum .",
    "these spectra were located approximately east - west on the sky along where evidence from @xcite suggests a stellar bar exists .",
    "we note , however , that double - peaked emission lines may also occur due to smearing of the rotation curve within the 5  sparsepak fibers",
    ". the spectra along the major axis would be most susceptible to this beam smearing as the velocity gradient is highest here .",
    "since the bar is oriented close to the major axis of ngc5005 , it would be difficult to verify that the double - peaked emission lines are signatures of infalling gas along the bar .",
    "alternatively , the beam smearing effect would be minimized for velocities along the minor axis , so it is reasonable to assume that the double - peaked emission lines seen in the -005 + 003 spectrum in figure [ spectra ] are real and are not merely due to observational effects .",
    "the flux calibrated , sky subtracted spectra were cross - correlated with a template emission line spectrum to extract the luminosity weighted mean recessional velocity at every position using the iraf task fxcor .",
    "we used the spectrum of an hii region from within ngc5005 as our reference template for the cross - correlation analysis due to its strong narrow emission lines .",
    "spectra with a tonry and davis ratio ( tdr ; @xcite ) less than 5 were not included in deriving the velocity field .",
    "spectra with broad or double - peaked emission line profiles resulted in broad cross - correlation peaks that were nonetheless of high significance and had a well - defined centroid .",
    "the velocity values from fxcor were then placed into a grid that mapped the sparsepak fiber locations . to fill in the missing spacings , the velocity field was then interpolated using the average value from the nearest eight pixels .",
    "analysis of the velocity field will be discussed further in section [ spakkin ] .",
    "imaging observations at 3.6@xmath0 m were obtained using the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ on 2012 july 12 and 19 .",
    "observations were conducted in a grid - like mapping pattern of 10 @xmath12 9 dithered pointings , where each pointing was offset by @xmath2100  to cover a total area of 18  @xmath12 33 .",
    "observations were taken in two sets separated by several days to enable asteroid removal from the mosaicked images .",
    "the resulting map has a total exposure time of 1800 s pixel@xmath3 .",
    "this exposure time provides a sensitivity of a few@xmath120.01 m@xmath11 pc@xmath22 over a field of view 5 times the size of the optical radius r@xmath23 . after standard processing ,",
    "the individual pointings were combined into maps using the mosaicker and point source extractor ( mopex ) software .",
    "images were drizzled to resample the data to 0.75  pixel@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maps were fit for a first order sky subtraction to remove any gradient in the sky level .",
    "figure [ bigfov ] shows the full extent of the faint stellar disk component of ngc5005 detected in the final mosaicked and sky subtracted 3.6@xmath0 m image .",
    "the image on the left has been smoothed to bring out the lowest surface brightness features .",
    "the immense sensitivity over such a large field of view enables a complete study of the faint extended stellar component of ngc5005 .",
    "ngc5005 has a large high surface brightness disk , which is surrounded by an even more extended low surface brightness component .",
    "this faint stellar population extends about twice as far as the break or transition radius between the high and low surface brightness components and nearly three times farther than the gas disk detected in hi .",
    "this is an unusual result , as most spiral and irregular galaxies with hi have a diameter in hi that is larger than the optical diameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a feature that appears to be a faint stellar stream extending to the northeast towards an apparent companion galaxy sdss j131105.57 + 371036.1 . to measure the stellar mass associated with the apparent stellar stream , we used the smoothed and masked image to create a hand - drawn polygonal aperture that traces the area associated with the diffuse light ( figure [ bigfov ] ) .",
    "we measured a lower limit for the flux in the stream of 0.15 @xmath5 0.13 mjy based on a conservatively masked image .",
    "however , this value significantly underestimates the total flux associated with the stream due to the significant masking required to remove the large area associated with the bright foreground star located in the middle of the stream .",
    "thus , to obtain a more accurate estimate of the total mass associated with the stream , we replaced the masked pixels with a value interpolated from neighboring pixels and remeasured the total flux to be 0.35 mjy .",
    "assuming the best - fitting disk mass - to - light ratio of 0.5 ( section [ dmdecomp ] ) and a distance to ngc5005 of 16.5 mpc , this corresponds to a total stellar mass for the stream of 1.8 @xmath12 10@xmath24 m@xmath25 , which is an order of magnitude less massive than notable streams identified around other galaxies , such as m63 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and m83 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent companion galaxy is not detected in the hi observations and does not have a redshift measurement available in the literature . however ,",

    "figure [ n5005 ] ( d ) shows the final velocity field with isovelocity contours .",
    "the straight isovelocity contours seen in figure [ n5005 ] ( d ) indicate that the rotational velocity of the gas remains fairly constant with radius with no obvious signs of a warp at large radii .",
    "kinematic warps due to changes in position and/or inclination angle of the disk often result in a velocity field with a characteristic s - shaped distortion seen at larger radii ( e.g. , m83 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the low signal - to - noise of the hi observations within the central @xmath220  ( 1.6 kpc at 16.5 mpc ) makes it difficult to trace the hi gas motions .",
    "however , as introduced previously , @xcite found an s - shaped distortion in the co velocity field .",
    "this central kinematic distortion is most likely due to the presence of a bar causing the gas to be in non - circular orbits .",
    "the filled circles in the bottom panel of figure [ rotcur ] show the rotation curve for ngc5005 derived by fitting a series of concentric tilted rings to the hi velocity field ( gipsy task rotcur ) . in this analysis",
    "the galaxy is described using a set of concentric rings , each with its own center coordinates ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , systemic velocity ( @xmath33 , expansion velocity , inclination angle ( _ i _ ) , position angle ( p.a . ) , and rotation velocity ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the radii and widths of the rings are defined such that the rotation curve is sampled at a rate of two points per synthesized beam width , which in this case is every 10 .",
    "the expansion velocity is fixed to zero .",
    "initial estimates for the center coordinates , inclination angle , and position angle were first obtained by fitting ellipses to the hi intensity distribution out to 3@xmath30 ( gipsy task ellfit ) .",
    "the systemic velocity was measured from the spectral profile derived from the integrated intensity hi map .",
    "these initial values were fed into rotcur and iteratively fit to the receding and approaching sides together .",
    "once the center position ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) was fixed , rotcur was run again to determine @xmath37 with _ i _ and p.a . as free parameters .",
    "additional runs of rotcur were used with ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 fixed to determine _ i _ and p.a . for a combination of both sides .",
    "the rings are allowed to vary in position and inclination angle as a function of radius to account for warps ( _ top panels _ ) .",
    "however , point - to - point variations in _ i _ can be caused by effects such as streaming motions along spiral arms for which the fitting routine tries to compensate by changing",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "a smoothly varying or constant distribution in _",
    "i _ and p.a . was adopted to derive the underlying bulk rotation and prevent spurious second - order effects in the rotation curve . because variations in position and inclination angle were small ,",
    "constant position and inclination angles were used for this analysis ( _ dashed lines _ ) . smoothly varying fits to both the inclination and position angle were also tried and determined to be unnecessary as this only changed the derived circular rotational velocities by a few km s@xmath3",
    ". a final run of rotcur was done with all parameters fixed to derive the final azimuthally averaged rotation curve ( _ bottom panel , filled circles _ ) .",
    "uncertainties on the rotational velocities were conservatively estimated to be a combination of non - circular thermal gas motions and inclination errors .",
    "the uncertainties on the rotational velocities for the first two radii are dominated by thermal gas motions and beam smearing .",
    "a velocity dispersion , or second moment map , was created from the high resolution hi data cube .",
    "uncertainties due to thermal gas motions were estimated to be about 10%  of the average velocity dispersion values , which is the accuracy to which we believe the line centroid can be estimated .",
    "the velocity dispersion for ngc5005 in the radial range 20  to 40  is quite large ; average values range between 40 - 50 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this is why the first two rotation curve points have noticeably larger error bars than the rotational velocities farther out where the dispersion drops to more typical values on the order of 15 km s@xmath3 . outside of r @xmath38 40 ,",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by inclination angle errors . due to the relatively high inclination angle ( @xmath268 ) of ngc5005 , an inclination angle error of @xmath510  in the inner parts and @xmath55  in the outer parts produces corresponding rotational velocity errors of @xmath3910%  and @xmath405% , respectively .",
    "circular rotational velocities and their errors in the central 20  were not derived from the neutral gas data due to the low signal - to - noise in the hi data .",
    "the rotation curve for ngc5005 is remarkably flat ; it varies by less than 10 km s@xmath3 over a range of radii from 20  to 140  ( 1.6 kpc to 11.2 kpc at 16.5 mpc ) .",
    "the last measured rotational velocity is 265.2@xmath522.0 km s@xmath3 which yields a dynamical mass of ( 1.83@xmath50.30)@xmath1210@xmath16 m@xmath11 at 140  ( 11.2 kpc at 16.5 mpc ) .",
    "if we assume that the rotation curve remains flat and extrapolate out to the break radius , this results in a dynamical mass of ( 2.82@xmath50.47)@xmath1210@xmath16 m@xmath11 measured at 216.3  ( 17.3 kpc at 16.5 mpc ) .",
    "the hi rotation curve for ngc5005 was additionally derived using a code for modeling asymmetries in disk galaxies ( diskfit : @xcite ) .",
    "diskfit uses a physically motivated model rather than a parameterization of concentric rings .",
    "it is capable of fitting models with both rotation and lopsided or bisymmetric non - circular motions , as would be expected due to the presence of a bar ( @xcite ) .",
    "rotation curves for ngc5005 were derived using three different models : rotation only , lopsided flow , and bisymmetric flow . due to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the hi at radii smaller than 20 , only the rotation dominated parts of the velocity field were fit .",
    "rotation curves derived from all three diskfit models , therefore , were in good agreement with a rotation only model and the tilted ring fits from rotcur .",
    "derived best fitting kinematic parameters from gipsy s rotcur and diskfit s rotation only model are presented in table [ kinprops ] .      given the low signal - to - noise ratio of the hi observations in the inner 20  of ngc5005 , we turn to ionized gas to provide kinematic constraints in this inner region .",

    "regions where the [ nii]@xmath216584 line flux is strongest represent areas with higher signal - to - noise ratios with typical tdr values around 40 from the cross - correlation results .",
    "the lower signal - to - noise ratio areas still have reliable cross - correlation results with tdr values closer to 20 .",

    "the ionized gas velocity field was sampled every 5  out to a radius of 35 .",
    "we allowed the position angle , inclination angle , and the systemic velocity to be fit by rotcur and not constrained to the values used for the hi derived rotation curve .",
    "constant values of position and inclination angle were adopted ( _ dash - dot lines _ ) .",
    "the ionized gas data fills in the central kinematics that are unconstrained by the hi observations and extends up towards the hi derived rotation velocity at 40 .",

    "indeed , the m / l ratio at 3.6@xmath0 m is nearly independent of star formation history ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of nir , hi , and co observations allow many of the uncertainties associated with the spatial distribution of both major baryonic components ( gas and stars ) to be minimized .",
    "the contributions from gas and stars to the overall rotation curve for ngc5005 were calculated from the gas mass and stellar light surface density profiles .",
    "the gas mass surface density was measured from the hi and co integrated intensity maps .",
    "the gas distributions were derived separately and then added together to create a total gas mass surface density distribution .",
    "the contribution to the total circular rotational velocity was calculated from the total gas distribution using the gipsy task rotmod assuming an infinitely thin gas disk .",
    "following @xcite , the total gas mass was multiplied by a factor 1.3 to account for primordial helium .",
    "figure [ gasmsd ] shows the gas mass surface density distributions for the hi and h@xmath15 ( as traced by co ) separately ( _ filled circles _ and _ stars _ , respectively ) , as well as the resulting total gas distribution when added together ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "the molecular gas is the dominant contribution to the total gas mass surface density for radii within 60  ( 4.8 kpc at 16.5 mpc ) .",
    "the bump in the molecular gas distribution between 30 - 40  corresponds to the ring of emission observed in the narrowband h@xmath1 image ( section [ optdata ] and figure [ ellipses ] ) .",
    "model rotation curves for the stellar distributions were derived separately for the bulge and disk based on the decomposed light surface density profiles discussed in section [ 3.6data ] .",
    "the contribution to the total circular rotational velocity for these stellar components were calculated with rotmod .",
    "a vertical sech - squared distribution with a vertical scale height of 0.93 kpc estimated using the fiducial relation derived in @xcite was used for the stellar disk model .",
    "a spherical distribution was assumed for the bulge model rotational velocities .",
    "figure [ rotfit ] presents the rotation curve decomposition for ngc5005 .",
    "circular rotation velocities for the total gas , stellar bulge , and stellar disk were summed in quadrature and subtracted from the observed rotation curve .",
    "a spherical pseudo - isothermal dark matter halo model was fit to the residuals .",
    "the bulge and disk m / l ratios were left as free parameters to be fit during the decomposition .",
    "they were assumed to be constant with radius .",
    "for this galaxy , leaving the stellar disk and bulge m / l ratios in addition to the characteristic radius ( r@xmath43 ) and velocity ( v@xmath44 ) of the dark matter halo model as free parameters creates a poorly constrained problem without a unique solution .",
    "therefore , the best fitting r@xmath43 , v@xmath44 , m / l@xmath45 , and m / l@xmath46 were achieved using interactive fitting .",
    "the best fit achieved in this analysis resulted in a disk m / l@xmath46 = 0.5 and a bulge m / l@xmath45 = 0.4 . this disk",
    "m / l is consistent with @xcite who suggest that the m / l ratio at 3.6@xmath0 m should be about 0.5 based on stellar population models and measurements of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the bulge and disk m / l ratios result in a best - fitting dark matter halo model with a characteristic radius of 2.5@xmath50.1 kpc and a velocity of 228@xmath51.0 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the observed rotation curve could not be adequately described at large radii using the baryonic contributions alone ( crosses in figure [ rotfit ] ) .",
    "the dip in velocity in the observed ionized gas rotation curve between 12 - 24  ( 0.96- 1.92 kpc at 16.5 mpc ) is an interesting feature which demonstrates the connection between the galaxy morphology and its kinematics .",
    "it appears to occur in the transition region between the nuclear disk and ring structure , as seen in the h@xmath1 image ( figure [ ellipses ] _ left _ ) and detected in co emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "this region corresponds to a decrease in the total gas contribution to the overall rotation curve , which is dominated by the molecular gas at these inner radii ( figure [ gasmsd ] ) , as well as to where the stellar contribution to the overall rotation curve transitions from being bulge- to disk - dominated .",
    "it is also visible as a prominent dip in the equivalent width profile seen in figure [ phot ] ( d ) .",
    "the mass decomposition reveals that ngc5005 is baryon dominated at the inner - most radii .",
    "ngc5005 follows the same trend as most other massive , luminous galaxies where its mass is baryon dominated in the core and gradually becomes more dark matter dominated with increasing radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , galaxies of similar dynamical mass from @xcite , such as ngc6946 and ngc7331 , display rotation curve decompositions similar to that of ngc5005 where the dark matter halo contribution to the total rotation curve does not overtake the stellar disk contribution to the total rotation curve until close to or beyond the last measured point .",
    "the fractional contribution of the maximum stellar disk to the rotation curve at 2.2 times the disk scale length is only 0.71 in ngc5005 .",
    "this implies that the stellar disk can only explain about 70%  of the observed rotation curve at the point where the stellar disk s contribution should be greatest .",
    "this is slightly less than average values found for other samples of galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) , which were between 0.8 and 0.9 .",
    "we have acquired multiwavelength observations to examine the gas and stellar content in ngc5005 .",
    "we have utilized new vla c configuration observations to explore the neutral hydrogen gas morphology and kinematics , as well as sparsepak ifu observations to derive kinematics of the ionized gas in the central region of ngc5005 .",
    "deep 3.6@xmath0 m images from _ spitzer _ allow us to trace the extended stellar population .",
    "finally , we have used optical broadband b and r and narrowband h@xmath1 observations to detect properties of the dominant stellar population and star formation activity .",
    "the main results from this multiwavelength study are summarized below .    1 .",
    "the most striking morphological feature of ngc5005 is its extended stellar population .",
    "the neutral and molecular gas components are both confined well within the high surface brightness stellar disk .",
    "the low surface brightness stellar component appears to extend nearly 3 times beyond the gas disk detected in hi .",
    "the central 40  of ngc5005 has a lack of detectable hi , but displays both molecular and ionized gas emission .",
    "spectra of the ionized gas in the central region of ngc5005 reveal signatures of both thermal and non - thermal emission processes . the nuclear agn region displays broad emission lines with non - thermal line intensity ratios .",
    "double - peaked emission lines are seen to the northwest of the nucleus , approximately where @xcite found dynamical evidence for infalling gas potentially due to an inconspicuous stellar bar .",
    "the ionized gas emission outside of the nuclear disk appears to be dominated by thermal processes from recent star formation activity .",
    "3 .   inspection of the optical broadband images reveals numerous known and suspected companions of ngc5005 .",
    "these include sdss j131051.05 + 365623.4 which was detected in the vla observations and sdss j131105.57 + 371036.1 which appears to be possibly connected to ngc5005 by a faint stellar stream .",
    "surface photometry of ngc5005 shows a nir surface brightness distribution with a central bulge component and an inner and outer exponential disk .",
    "the radial profile of optical color displays a distribution that is typical for large spirals like ngc5005 , and is consistent with ngc5005 having little current star formation activity .",
    "the unusually low star formation rate and equivalent width measurements from the h@xmath1 imaging are expected given the gas poor nature of ngc5005 .",
    "a rotation curve for ngc5005 was derived from both the neutral and ionized gas kinematics . the ionized gas rotation curve in the central region of ngc5005 exhibits structure which can be connected directly to the ionized gas morphology ( which follows the molecular gas ) , and also appears to correspond to the stellar distribution as it transitions from bulge to disk dominated .",
    "the hi rotation curve at large radii is remarkably flat and exhibits no signs of warps .",
    "the gas kinematics and surface densities were used in conjunction with the stellar bulge and disk light profiles to decompose the observed rotation curve of ngc5005 and derive a model dark matter distribution .",
    "the results of the mass decomposition demonstrate that ngc5005 is baryon dominated in its central region and that the prominent stellar disk only maximally contributes about 70%  to the total rotation curve .",
