    "recently , two of us have pointed out @xcite that the generalized bjorken - gottfried hypothesis @xcite , relating the space - time position of a hadron produced in a high - energy collision to its 4-momentum , can qualitatively explain the mass - dependence of the interaction radii observed in @xmath3 annihilation at lep i @xcite . as discussed in detail in @xcite ,",
    "this effect is a manifestation of the well - established observation @xcite that a correlation between the momentum and the emission point of a particle can drastically affect the results of the hbt correlation experiment . in the present note",
    "we want to explore in more detail the idea formulated in @xcite in order to verify , if it indeed provides a viable framework for the understanding of the mass dependence of the hbt parameters .",
    "the generalized bjorken - gottfried hypothesis , as formulated in @xcite , postulates the linear relation between the 4-momentum of the produced particle and the space - time position at which it is produced ) to a discussion of the quantum interference between identical particles was proposed ( in a different context ) by csorgo and zimanyi @xcite ] : @xmath4 relation ( [ 1 ] ) implies @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the _ longitudinal _ proper time after the collision ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are time and longitudinal position of the production point ) .",
    "since this picture is purely classical , it represents only a qualitative idea , whose application to the description of the actual data requires an adequate reformulation taking into account the effects of the quantum nature of the system considered . in @xcite",
    "we have proposed to use ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) as a guide - line for construction of the source function @xmath10 @xcite related to the density matrix in momentum space by a fourier transform @xmath11 all variables are four dimensional , so that both space and time integrations are involved . thus specifying the source function fixes completely the single particle properties of the model .",
    "similarly as the standard wigner function @xcite , @xmath10 gives approximately ( as far as possible without contradicting quantum mechanics ) the single - particle distribution in momentum and in space - time .",
    "therefore it has an intuitive meaning ) ) .",
    "consequently some care is needed in order to assess its physical interpretation . ] . which can be exploited for implementation of the relations ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) .",
    "the construction of @xmath10 ( described in the next section ) requires specification of several details which can only be determined from a confrontation with data .",
    "we thus analyse the single- and two - pion distributions in the framework of the scheme proposed in @xcite and compare them with the data from the delphi experiment at lep i @xcite in order ( i ) to pin down the parameters describing the system and ( ii ) to verify that their values are reasonable , i.e. , that the whole scheme is not unrealistic .",
    "our conclusion is rather optimistic : the proposed scheme seems to describe adequately the lep i data .",
    "as , in addition , it provides a reasonable intuitive picture of the hadronization , one may hope that it represents a useful framework for the description of the general properties of this process .    in the next two sections we describe the construction of the source function and",
    "calculate the single particle density matrix in momentum space . in section 4 the formulae for two - particle correlation functions",
    "are derived .",
    "comparison with the data is discussed in section 5 and 6 .",
    "the last section contains our conclusions and outlook .",
    "to implement the conditions ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) we postulate the source function in the factorized form @xmath12 where @xmath13 \\label{7}\\ ] ] and @xmath14   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\left(\\vec{p}_{\\perp}- \\frac{m_{\\perp}}{\\tau}\\vec{x}_{\\perp}\\right)^2 } { 2\\delta_{\\perp}^2}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{3c } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 so that @xmath16 we have used gaussian forms in order to simplify the evaluation of the fourier transform ( [ 5 ] ) . as shown below , this admittedly crude assumption seems sufficient at the present level of analysis and accuracy of the data .",
    "the first exponential factor in @xmath17 represents a standard cylindrically symmetric `` tube '' of radius @xmath18 in configuration space dependence of the single particle spectrum .",
    "this seems a reasonable approximation in the central rapidity region at high energy and can be easily removed , if necessary . ] .",
    "the remaining exponential introduces a correlation between the momentum and the emission point of the particle , as required by the generalized bjorken - gottfried condition ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "such correlations are known to influence strongly the hbt effect on particle spectra @xcite and were shown in @xcite to induce the mass dependence of the hbt radii .",
    "the reason for the mass dependence is easily seen from ( [ 3 ] ) : at fixed @xmath19 , the correlation between momentum and position depends on transverse mass .    the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 parametrize the correlation lengths or - in other words - the size of the region ( centered at @xmath22 ) from which the observed particles emerge .",
    "they are arbitrary , apart from inequalities required for consistency with the quantum uncertainty principle , see , e.g. , @xcite , which put on them some weak lower limits .",
    "finally , the function @xmath23 gives the distribution of the proper time @xmath19 at which the particles are created .",
    "using now the formula ( [ 5 ] ) and the formulae of this section one can evaluate the single - particle density matrix in momentum space , which is a necessary step in the evaluation of both the single - particle spectrum and the two - particle hbt correlations .",
    "this calculation is outlined in the next section .",
    "substituting ( [ 6 ] ) into ( [ 5 ] ) we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the pseudorapidity : = ( ) [ x3.3 ] and @xmath28 from ( [ 5 ] ) we also see that @xmath29 the gaussian integral ( [ 3.2 ] ) for @xmath30 can be explicitly performed with the result @xmath31      \\label{3.4}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 the longitudinal integral is somewhat more complicated .",
    "we first express the energies and longitudinal momenta in terms of the respective rapidities @xmath33 substituting this into ( [ 3.3 ] ) we obtain after some algebra @xmath34 one sees from this formula that v depends only on @xmath35 and @xmath36 . consequently , after integration over @xmath27 the result depends only on @xmath36 .",
    "the integral ( [ 3.3a ] ) can now be evaluated .",
    "we first change the variable @xmath37 .",
    "then we express the hyperbolic functions of @xmath38 by exponentials . using the integral representation",
    "@xmath39 we obtain @xmath40 with @xmath41 using the identities @xmath42 we arrive , after some algebra , at our final formula @xmath43 where q_t^2= q_0 ^ 2-q_^2 [ 3.13 ] this completes the evaluation of the single - particle density matrix .",
    "the single particle distribution is given by the diagonal elements of the density matrix . from the formulae of the previous section we thus obtain    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46    to obtain information on the two - particle correlation function ,",
    "one has to make further assumptions .",
    "we follow the standard treatment @xcite , assuming that one can evaluate the two - particle correlation function as if there were no other correlations between particles except for those induced by quantum interference . under this condition",
    "the normalized two - particle correlation function is given by @xmath47 the final point we want to discuss is the selection of the variables used for comparison with the data , and the corresponding jacobians .",
    "the system of two identical particles is fully described by the 6 components of the momenta .",
    "the phase - space volume is d= dy dy d^2q _ d^2q_=2dydydp_^2 d q_^2 d4.5 where @xmath48 is the angle between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    as seen from the formulae of section 3 , it is convenient to replace the two rapidities by @xmath51 and @xmath52 . using the identity q_t^2= ( m_1-m_2)^2 -4 m_1m_2 ^2 ( ) [ 4.6 ] one obtains dy_1dy_2 = .",
    "4.7 thus everything can be expressed in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is sometimes convenient , however , to consider other variables . for completeness",

    "eq.([3.1 ] ) represents the density matrix as an integral over the proper time @xmath19 at which the particles are produced . in the present paper ,",
    "following @xcite , we shall accept the approximation that the production happens in a very narrow interval of @xmath19 , so that the integration over @xmath19 simply amounts to introduce a fixed value @xmath54 in the formulae of the previous section . in this way the unknown function @xmath23 is replaced by one parameter , @xmath55 .",
    "the other three parameters are : @xmath56 , @xmath21 and @xmath57 , each with a very clear physical meaning",
    ".    the first step in the data analysis should be the correct description of the single particle spectrum using the eq.([4.1 ] ) .",
    "this also allows to restrict somewhat the values of the four parameters we have to our disposal .    for this purpose the data sample of @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath0 hadronic decays from the delphi experiment",
    "was used @xcite .",
    "hadronic events have been selected using standard delphi cuts @xcite which limit the contamination of beam - gas,@xmath60,@xmath61 and ee events to less than 0.1% and @xmath62 contamination to below @xmath63 . in this study only two - jet like events",
    "were considered ( thrust @xmath64 0.95 ) .",
    "the distribution of transverse momentum with respect to the event thrust axis was constructed for tracks which are not obvious decay products of @xmath65 s and are not positively identified as k s or p s .    the formula ( [ 4.1 ] ) has been fitted to the distribution in the @xmath66 region up to 2.0 @xmath67 which contains @xmath68 of the data .",
    "the small @xmath66 @xmath69 interval was excluded from fits because it is particularly uncertain experimentally due to the contribution of low momentum pions from the @xmath70 decays and to a possible distortion of the distribution by imperfect approximation of the primary quark direction by the measured thrust axis .",
    "the unknown parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 plus normalization ) were determined by minimizing a @xmath71 function with the minuit program @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 was kept fixed in fits at the value of 1.5 fm . since correlations between some fit parameters",
    "are high , we used a 3 standard deviation correlation ellipse for each parameter pair to estimate their statistical errors .",
    "in addition , the stability of the results of the fit has been checked by varying the range of fitted @xmath66 .",
    "the extreme values of a parameter resulting from these fits were used as a measure of the range of a parameter allowed by the data .",
    "although the fits converged easily to a deep minimum , their @xmath71 value was not always statistically acceptable .",
    "nevertheless , we accept these fits as long as the shape of the experimental distribution is correctly reproduced over a wide range of @xmath66 .",
    "the too high @xmath73 value is attributed to underestimated errors ( imperfect treatment of systematics , no background subtraction etc ) rather , than to failure of the fitted hypothesis .",

    "the two - particle correlation function is calculated according to formula ( [ 4.4 ] ) using the values of the parameters from table  [ parameters ] .",
    "correlations between parameters determined by the fit are taken into account by sampling the area of the 3@xmath75 correlation ellipse for each parameter pair with a gaussian distribution . at the presence of correlations between the parameters",
    "this procedure results in a much more reliable estimate of the statistical error on the calculated correlation function value than the 1-dim .",
    "errors given by minuit .",
    "systematic effects of the fit are accounted for by repeating calculations for extreme values of the parameters allowed by the @xmath66 distribution .",
    "this procedure was needed especially for the parameter @xmath76 which is the least constrained by the one - particle distribution . in this way",
    "the value of the correlation function for each particle was determined together with its error , where both error contributions described above have been added linearly .",
    "the result of the calculation for pions is shown in figs.[correlator]a , b for the perpendicular and parallel components , respectively .",
    "cc    one sees that these functions are not gaussian .",
    "nevertheless , to compare with the existing data , we have approximated the results by gaussians in the region @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ correlator ] ) .",
    "the exclusion of the small @xmath78 region may be justified by the well - know fact that the measurements of the correlation function at very small @xmath78 are very uncertain ( and often this region is omitted in the data analyses at lep ) .",
    "the results of this procedure for pions are shown in fig .",
    "[ r_massdep](a ) together with measurements of the three lep experiments @xcite done in correlation studies in two- and three dimensions .",
    "cc    in the experimental studies @xmath79 is decomposed into three components in the longitudinal center - of - mass ( lcms ) frame , where the sum of the three - vector momenta is perpendicular to the thrust axis .",
    "choosing @xmath80 parallel to the thrust axis , @xmath81 parallel to the sum of the momenta ( in the lcms frame ) and @xmath82 orthogonal to both , the decomposition reads : q^2 = q_l^2 + q_side^2 + q_out^2(1-^2 ) ; = delphi performed the analysis in two dimensions , determining correlation radii corresponding to @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and to @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "the l3 and opal analyses where done in three components , therefore , as the measure of @xmath84 we have chosen @xmath87 . the spread of the experimental results is considerable , which might be due to different methodology ( eg",
    ". different reference sample , corrections for coulomb repulsion etc ) and differing phase space regions selected .",
    "however the clustering of the data points for @xmath88 at larger values than those for @xmath84 is clearly visible .",
    "shaded bands in the plot represent the errors on the calculated @xmath84 and @xmath88 .",
    "the most remarkable feature seen in this figure is that the model predicts , in agreement with experiment , a longitudinal radius much larger than the transverse one .",
    "one also sees that both radii fall in the ballpark of about @xmath89 fm which is hardly surprising .",
    "it is also clear that -within the rather large theoretical and experimental errors- the model seems to account for the gross features of the data .",
    "the calculations were also done for kaons , protons and @xmath90 s .",
    "since the available data samples for these particles are much smaller than those for pions , their @xmath66 distributions are not discriminative enough to pin - point reliably the model parameters .",
    "therefore the parameters were taken the same as for pions ( given in table  [ parameters ] ) .",
    "this assumption is to be verified once better data are available but we have checked that it reproduces reasonably well the main characteristics of the transverse momentum distributions of kaons , protons and @xmath90 s .",
    "the resulting correlation functions for all these particles are of gaussian form over a wide range of @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( up to several hundred mev ) and thus the source radii are well defined .",
    "the mass dependence of the calculated @xmath88 and @xmath84 is plotted in in fig .",
    "[ r_massdep](b ) where also the available results of the lep experiments @xcite are shown .",
    "one sees that the inequality @xmath93 is still satisfied in the model , although the difference between the two radii at higher masses is not as large as in the case of pions .",
    "the data points in this figure correspond to the correlation radius @xmath94 determined in 1-dimensional analyses ( the only available data for heavy particles)@xcite .",
    "multiple entries of the result from the same experiment for pions correspond to different measurements made with different reference samples .",
    "the points at kaon mass represent measurements for both @xmath95 and @xmath96 pairs .",
    "the measurements for @xmath90 pairs come from spin analysis ( except for the second aleph point with small error ) where there is no need for a reference sample .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath97 and the two radii @xmath88 and @xmath84 is not obvious ( at least experimentally ) , but the trend of the data is reasonably well reproduced by the model .",
    "more accurate data on kaons would be of great help to further elucidate this point .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that the correlation between the momentum and the production point of a produced hadron , suggested by the gottfried - bjorken hypothesis of in - out cascade , seems to account ( at least approximately ) for the observed correlation between identical particles observed in @xmath3 annihilation .",
    "together with data on the single particle transverse momentum distribution , it predicts strong anisotropy of the two - pion correlation function , in agreement with the observations .",
    "the mass dependence of the `` effective source radius '' is also adequately described .",
    "large uncertainties , both in the theoretical determination of the model parameters , and in the experimental data do not allow , however , to obtain more quantitative conclusions .",
    "\\(i ) one sees from the table 1 that out of the three parameters determined from transverse momentum distribution , only two ( @xmath56 and @xmath21 ) are relatively well constrained , whereas @xmath20 is only weakly restricted .",
    "it is interesting to note that - within the wide range allowed - the value of @xmath20 is consistent with the relation @xmath98 corresponding to the quasi - isotropic case . accepting this isotropy",
    ", we see that the effective width of the momentum distribution around the average given by the bjorken - gottfried condition ( [ 1 ] ) is close to 300 mev , a rather reasonable value .",
    "\\(ii ) the mass dependence of the effective hbt correlation radii calculated from the model and shown in fig.6 was obtained under the assumption that the parameters of the model do not depend on particle masses .",
    "this assumption was verified ( within large experimental uncertainties ) for @xmath56 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "no such direct check is available for @xmath55 .",
    "however , since the observed mass dependence of the hbt correlation radii does agree -at least approximately - with the experimental observations , we may take it as an argument that _ also @xmath55 does not depend on particle masses _ : _ 0 ~const(m _ ) .",
    "[ z1 ] this seems a rather non - trivial conclusion , as it indicates that -within the bjorken - gottfried hypothesis ( [ 1])- all particles are emitted at , roughly , the same proper time @xmath55 .",
    "this result may be contrasted with a simple expectation ( sometimes justified by uncertainty principle ) suggesting _ 0 ~1 m _ [ zz ] which would give a stronger drop of @xmath99 with increasing mass , particularly for transverse radius .",
    "it seems that also the models based on the picture of string decay @xcite would not fulfill the condition ( [ z1 ] ) but rather obey _ 0 ~m_. [ zz1 ] such a relation corresponds , in our model , to a much weaker dependence of the correlation radii on the particle masses and thus an other mechanism would have to be invented to describe the data @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) in the present paper , studying the two - particle distribution , we considered -following the approach employed in experimental analyses @xcite- the boost invariant variable @xmath100 and the variable @xmath101 evaluated in the longitudinal center - of - mass system . assuming boost invariance and azimuthal symmetry of the distributions",
    ", one finds that a complete analysis would involve 4 variables .",
    "as it is convenient to choose them boost invariant , one could use for instance the two transverse momenta @xmath102 and @xmath103 the relative azimuthal angle @xmath104 and the relative rapidity @xmath105 .",
    "it would be interesting to see the data analysed in this way .",
    "\\(iv ) another interpretation of the experimentally observed hbt parameters was given in @xcite .",
    "the authors take the point of view that the observed hbt radii do indeed correspond to the actual size of the particle emission region which is thus strongly dependent on the particle mass .",
    "they argue that this dependence may be understood from the uncertainty principle .",
    "it may be worth to point out that this approach is rather different from ours .",
    "in our description the parameters characterizing the particle emission region are _ mass independent _ and the observed change in the hbt radii comes _ solely _ from the momentum - position correlation as expressed in the assumed bjorken - gottfried condition ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "\\(v ) our prescription for construction of the two - particle correlation function out of the single - particle source function is similar to -but not identical with- that advocated recently by heinz and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the difference is in the treatment of the fourth component of the average momentum vector of the two particles [ @xmath106 . as seen from ( [ 3.3b ] ) , we use p_0 12 ( e_1+e_2 ) [ z3 ] which guarantees the four - vector character of @xmath107 but brings it off mass - shell .",
    "heinz et al .",
    "propose to take p_0= [ z4 ] which insures @xmath108 but induces complicated transformation properties . in practice , however , one is only interested in the region @xmath109 where these two prescriptions are not substantially different ( the source functions themselves , however , are not the same ) .",
