    "the five dimensional picture of the universe has attracted much interest in the framework of what is called brane world cosmology .",
    "several models have been proposed .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a stabilization of the radion field provides the classical friedman equation .",
    "many papers ( see for instance : @xcite ) have considered a supersymmetric version of brane world which embed brane world in the framework of superstrings theories . in the present work",
    "we choose to work in a set - up where we assume that the radion is stabilized in a five dimensional supergravity compactified on @xmath0 where matter and gauge fields live on the branes and gravity in the bulk ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "low energy supersymmetry provides a natural candidate for dark matter if r - parity @xcite is conserved and solves the hierarchy problem .",
    "we have to point out that in the present model the extra - dimension does not play a role to solve the hierarchy problem like in add model ( @xcite , @xcite ) or randall sundrum @xcite .",
    "it is supersymmetry which plays this role .",
    "so the size of this extra dimension is not constrained like in @xcite and actually we are dealing with smaller extra - dimension than in those scenarios . + as a general framework we can choose a scenario in which susy breaking is mediated to the observable sector partly by gravity anomaly and partly by scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is a scenario which can avoid the appearance of tachionic masses which are present in pure anomaly mediated scenario and problems due to pure gravity mediation scenario .",
    "this mechanism provides high masses for gravitino ( it means that the mass of the gravitino can be above @xmath1 tev ) .",
    "+ the gravitino field has kaluza - klein excitations modes due to the presence of the extra - dimension .",
    "we suppose that all gravitino modes are produced after inflation during the reheating period by scattering effects in the primordial thermal bath . we suppose that the lightest mode - i.e. the zero mode - is heavy enough to mainly decay before the big bang nucleosynthesis starts and we calculate its corresponding mass . actually this is naturally the case in some scenarios of susy breaking ( anomaly mediation or mix between anomaly and scherk - schwarz mechanism ) .",
    "gravitinos modes decay into supersymmetric particles and standard model ones .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , all gravitino modes will give at the end of their decay cascade a lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which is assumed to be the lightest neutralino .",
    "but not all of these decay products of gravitino will contribute to the relic density of neutralinos which is assumed to be the dark matter .",
    "actually only the gravitino modes which decay after the thermal decoupling of neutralino contribute to the dark matter density .",
    "if a gravitino mode decays before the thermal decoupling of neutralinos it does not increase the number density of neutralinos since these gravitinos produce neutralinos which are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "so a finite number of gravitinos modes contribute to the non thermally produced dark matter .",
    "the total of the thermally produced and non thermally produced amount of dark matter is constrained by the evaluation of the dark matter content of the universe . as a consequence",
    ", we can draw curves of constraints between the size of the extra - dimension and the reheating temperature because the number of kk gravitinos modes is related to the size of the extra - dimension and the number density of gravitinos is related to the reheating temperature .",
    "we have chosen a reheating temperature in the range @xmath2 gev to @xmath3 gev .",
    "this range is quite natural for scenarios which allow baryogenesis through leptogenesis .",
    "there is another constraint on the size of the extra - dimension coming from the fact that there are also kk gravitons which can disturb bbn if the number of kk modes is too high .",
    "+ in the present work we first present the interactions between kk gravitino and mssm , and discuss abundance and lifetime of gravitino .",
    "after this , we estimate the thermal production of neutralinos function of @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the neutralinos freezing temperature and @xmath6 the neutralino mass .",
    "we then present the model , the equations of constraints and check that kk gravitons are not a problem for bbn for @xmath7 tev .",
    "finally we show and comment the results .",
    "the four dimensional ( reduced ) planck mass m is related to the five dimensional one @xmath8 by the relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the physical radius , @xmath11 is an undetermined real constant and @xmath12 . + as matter and gauge fields live on the brane , those fields do not have a dependence on the fifth coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "the two gravitino fields ( odd and even under @xmath14 ) have the following fourier expansion : + for the even fields under @xmath14 : @xmath15 \\ , , \\label{grava}\\ ] ] and the odd fields : @xmath16    we can define :    @xmath17    @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the kaluza - klein modes . + here are the relevant terms of interactions between matter , gauge fields and gravitino in the four dimensional supergravity lagrangian :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 are scalar fields , @xmath22 are chiral fermions , @xmath23 are gauge fermions ( gauginos ) , @xmath24 is the field strength tensor for the gauge boson @xmath25 .",
    "indices i , j .. represent species of chiral multiplets and ( a ) , ( b ) .... are indices for adjoint representation of gauge group .",
    "e is the vierbein .",
    "@xmath26 is the kahler metric . +",
    "this lagrangian ( [ l4 ] ) describes the interaction of the @xmath27 mode with matter and gauge fields .",
    "+ we obtain the four dimensional lagrangian by integrating over the fifth dimension the five dimensional one . as the gauge fields and matter fields of the observable sector live on one brane ( for instance the one located at @xmath28 ) ,",
    "the part of the action which contains interaction of the gravitino field with the matter and gauge fields is :    @xmath29    using the definition ( [ gravb ] ) and inserting the fourier expansion of gravitino ( [ grava ] ) and ( [ grav ] ) into the above action , we find the interactions of each kk mode with matter and gauge fields after integrating on the fifth dimension . after redefining kk modes of gravitino ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath30    and    @xmath31",
    "we find :    @xmath32    so we get an infinite sum of the lagrangian ( [ l4 ] )",
    ". each kaluza - klein mode has the same interaction with matter and gauge fields .",
    "this is not a surprise in the sense that graviton and gravitino are in the same supermultiplet and each kk gravitons has the same interaction with matter and gauge fields @xcite .",
    "+ gravitino kaluza - klein modes differ only by their masses .",
    "they get a mass through the super - higgs mechanism . +",
    "other redefinitions of the gravitinos fields have to be performed to obtain the gravitino mass matrix .",
    "those redefinitions do not play a role in the interaction part .",
    "after diagonalization of the mass matrix there are no interactions between the different kk modes .",
    "+ the masses of the modes n are related to the mass of the zero mode by the relation ( @xcite,@xcite ) :    @xmath33",
    "in the present work we suppose is very small @xcite of the order of @xmath34 ev and so it can not decay into the gravitinos .",
    "but with such a mass the radion is a problem for cosmology because it can dominate the universe energy density if the value of its potential at @xmath35 is close to the planck mass @xcite .",
    "this problem is evaded if the value of the potential at @xmath36 is between @xmath3 and @xmath37 gev see @xcite . ]",
    "that gravitinos are produced during the reheating period after inflation by scattering processes .",
    "all the mssm particles are in thermal equilibrium except the gravitino which decouples as soon as it is produced because of its extremely weak interaction ( gravitational one ) .",
    "ten reactions are considered to calculate the gravitino production .",
    "infrared divergences appear in the calculation due to the exchange of massless gauge bosons in the t - channel .",
    "this problem is avoided by the method developed in @xcite .",
    "another group ( @xcite,@xcite ) has recently done the calculation again with a slightly difference in the result .",
    "abundance is given in @xcite taking into account production during the inflaton - dominated epoch and @xcite has the same result without taking into account production during inflation .",
    "this result is given for masses of gravitino much higher than gauginos masses but the calculation of the creation term in the boltzmann equation is made with particles without masses : their mass is supposed negligible compared to the average energy in the center of mass of each reaction .",
    "the formula is :    @xmath38      \\left [ 1           - 0.028 \\ln \\left ( \\frac{t_{\\rm r}}{10^{10}\\ { \\rm gev } }           \\right ) \\right ] ,      \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{ygrav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the number density , @xmath41 is the entropy density and @xmath42 the reheating temperature .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is the density per comoving volume .",
    "+ we have to take into account in our calculation the different masses of gravitino modes .",
    "we find as a good approximation this rule for the abundance of the different modes :    @xmath44    where k represents the index of the kk mode , @xmath45 is the mass of the @xmath46 gravitino mode and @xmath47 its abundance .",
    "+ in this model all particles are considered massless compared to the reheating temperature scale except the gravitino . all particles in the thermal bath are relativistic at @xmath42 except the gravitino modes which can be non relativistic if heavy enough .",
    "in a previous section we showed that each gravitino mode had the same interaction with matter and gauge fields .",
    "the only difference arises from the mass of the different modes .",
    "+ gravitino interacts gravitationally with mssm particles : its life time is long compared to the one of other particles .",
    "we have calculated the life time for heavy gravitino ( @xmath48 ) using @xcite :    @xmath49    in our model r - parity is conserved and the lsp is the lightest neutralino .",
    "+ several decay channels are possible .",
    "heavy gravitino decays mainly into squark - quark pairs or gluon - gluino pairs @xcite .",
    "we checked that finally one gravitino produces one non - thermal neutralino and not less because number density of susy particles produced by gravitino decay is so weak ( @xmath50 ) that they will more likely decay than interact to produce standard model particles : in the boltzmann equation the decay term is proportional to @xmath51 and the annihilation term is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "we also checked that annihilation of the lsp can be regarded as negligible because it will concern only the lsp produced by one gravitino mode when the total of modes is three .",
    "gravitino does not produce more than one lsp because even high energy quark or gluon produced by gravitino decay if they interact between them or with a quark or a gluon of the plasma will almost all time produce quarks or gluons rather than neutralinos as processes with strong interactions are favored compared to the ones with weak interactions .",
    "we also checked that the decay of gravitino modes does not increase entropy density because the energy density of each gravitino mode at the time of its decay is never higher than the radiation energy density at the same time : it is because all the gravitino modes decay before @xmath53 mev .",
    "in our model the lsp is the lightest neutralino . we choose to work with a mass of lsp equal to @xmath54 gev .",
    "this analysis can be easily rescaled for another choice for the mass : we also show results for a mass of the lsp equal to @xmath55 gev in the appendix .",
    "the dark matter density is @xcite : @xmath56    in the graph representing evolution of @xmath57 as a function of the quantity @xmath58 there are two zones .",
    "the first zone is the equilibrium zone in which neutralinos are in thermal equilibrium and in which @xmath51 decreases .",
    "the second zone is the zone after the freeze - out of neutralinos and in which @xmath51 is constant .",
    "the freeze - out occurs at @xmath59 .",
    "we call @xmath60 the thermal density of neutralinos .",
    "we find this approximate relation between @xmath60 and @xmath59 :    @xmath61    to establish this relation we used @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the relations below in which we have neglected the double log part .",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of effectively massless degrees of freedom , @xmath64 is the planck mass .",
    "@xmath65 function of @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath66 is between the two straight lines . ]",
    "we choose different values of @xmath67 and complete with the non thermal production coming from the gravitino decay .",
    "we call this non thermal production @xmath68",
    ".    @xmath69    as one gravitino produces one neutralino , we can write :    @xmath70    the index @xmath71 corresponds to the last mode to be taken into account .",
    "it is the mode decaying just when the lsp decouples from the thermal bath . only the gravitino modes decaying after the thermal decoupling of the neutralinos contribute to increase the quantity of neutralinos",
    "the thermal density @xmath65 and @xmath59 are related by the equation ( [ omegath ] ) . knowing the thermal density we can calculate the non thermal density to respect the requirement ( [ encadrement ] ) .",
    "+ knowing @xmath59 , we can calculate @xmath5 and then the mass of the last gravitino mode taken into account . + to do so we need a relation which allows us to convert temperature into time . in a radiation dominated universe assuming that the entropy per comoving volume is conserved the relation between t and t is : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this result ( [ timetemperature ] ) is obtained by solving the friedman equation in a radiation dominated universe assuming constant entropy per comoving volume .",
    "+ we use relation ( [ timetemperature ] ) to calculate the mass of the mode @xmath71 but also to calculate the mass of the 0 mode . for the mode @xmath71 , @xmath74 and for the 0 mode , @xmath75 .",
    "we write equality between the life time of the gravitino mode ( [ tempsdevie ] ) and the age of the universe ( [ timetemperature ] ) ( after having converted ( [ timetemperature ] ) into second ) and we can calculate the mass of the corresponding gravitino . +",
    "the gravitino which mainly decays at @xmath5 corresponds to the last mode to take into account in our kaluza - klein tower .",
    "we call it the mode @xmath71 . + the mass of the zero mode is calculated the same way : we just put as a condition that it mainly decays at @xmath53 mev not to disturb bbn .",
    "for a temperature equal to 1 mev we find with ( [ timetemperature ] ) @xmath76 .",
    "we then calculate @xmath77 with ( [ tempsdevie ] ) by writing : @xmath78 .",
    "we get @xmath79 . + the mass of the mode @xmath71 depends on the choice of @xmath59 which depends on the thermal density @xmath67 .",

    "+ the second value is calculated by choosing the maximum value for @xmath81 .",
    "this cross section is generically bounded @xcite by : @xmath82 with @xmath83 . by using the maximum value for the annihilation cross section",
    "we find our minimal thermal contribution .",
    "+ the last value is a medium value : we chose an @xmath59 value between our two @xmath59 extrema and calculate the thermal density corresponding to this @xmath59 value . + below is the table of values : +            the figures ( [ 2001bis ] ) , ( [ 2002 ] ) and ( [ 2003 ] ) represent the case 1 but for @xmath85 gev instead of @xmath54 gev .",
    "we notice that the curves of that case are above the curves for the case 1 with @xmath84 gev .",
    "we can explain this by looking at equation ( [ final ] ) : we notice that @xmath89 is nearly proportional to @xmath6 .",
