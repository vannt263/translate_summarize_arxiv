    "formally we have @xmath8 for any function @xmath9 .",
    "an important choice for @xmath9 is @xmath10 with the sum @xmath11 interpreted as the total mass of particles .",
    "for such a choice the right - hand side of ( [ eq12 ] ) is @xmath12 and this is consistent with our intuition ; the total mass for coagulating particles is conserved . in reality equation ( [ eq12 ] ) is not valid , and in the case of @xmath13 we only have @xmath14 analytically speaking , we can not interchange the differentiation with the summation in ( [ eq12 ] ) , and such an interchange can take place only if some suitable restrictions on the size of the coagulation rate @xmath15 is imposed as @xmath16 and @xmath6 get large .",
    "the strict inequality in ( [ eq13 ] ) does not contradict the conservation of mass ; for the sufficiently fast growing @xmath17 , particles of infinite size  the so - called gels  are formed , and the sum @xmath11 no longer represents the total mass .",
    "more precisely , if we write @xmath18 for the total mass of particles of size @xmath6 , then what we really have is @xmath19    a marcus  lushnikov process ( mlp ) is formulated as a simple microscopic model to study coagulation and gelation phenomena .",
    "mlp is a markov process which is defined on a finite state space @xmath20 given by @xmath21 what we have in mind is that @xmath22 is the total number of particles of size @xmath6 , and the condition @xmath23 means that @xmath24 is indeed the total mass of particles .",
    "the process @xmath25 is a markov process with infinitesimal generator @xmath26 , where @xmath27 when @xmath28 , @xmath29 is obtained from @xmath30 by replacing @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ; when @xmath35 , @xmath29 is obtained from @xmath30 by replacing @xmath22 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . in words , with rate @xmath39 , a pair of particles of sizes @xmath16 and @xmath6 is replaced with a single particle of size @xmath40 .",

    "also note that we intentionally have chosen a coagulation rate proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "the reason for this has to do with the fact that all pairs of particles are prone to coagulate , and , as a result , a typical particle undergoes a huge number of coagulations in one unit of time as @xmath24 gets large .",

    "\\(ii ) theorem  [ th16 ] is more satisfactory than theorem  [ th15 ] for three reasons .",
    "on one hand in theorem  [ th15 ] we only claim that if there exists a solution to se , then such a solution experiences an instantaneous gelation . in other words , we are only showing that there is no mass - conserving solution ; however , it is not known if , under the assumption of theorem  [ th15 ] , a solution exists . on the other hand , the macroscopic densities coming from mlp can not satisfy ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq113 ] ) because @xmath112 , and presumably a suitable modification of se would be necessary .",
    "finally , in theorem  [ th16 ] we are giving a bound on the time of the formation of a large particle .",
    "that is , we are giving more information about how instantaneous the gelation is .",
    "we should mention though that our lemma  [ lem32 ] in section  [ sec3 ] is partly inspired by the proof of carr and da costa in @xcite .",
    "( iii ) we note that under the assumption of theorem  [ th13 ] , the quickest way for gelation is to wait first for the creation of several large particles , and then large particles coagulate among themselves to produce even larger particles very quickly .",
    "after all if both @xmath16 and @xmath6 are of order @xmath113 , then @xmath17 is at least of order @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "however , under the assumption of theorem  [ th16 ] , gelation is the result of the coagulations of a large particle with any other particle .",
    "note that for a particle of size @xmath113 to coagulate with another particle , it takes a short time of order @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is small if @xmath118 is large .",
    "this explains why in theorem  [ th16 ] we have instantaneous gelation ; once a single large particle is formed , this large particle coagulates almost immediately with the others to grow even larger .",
    "( iv ) for instantaneous gelation , we only need @xmath119 with @xmath120 satisfying @xmath121 .",
    "a similar comment applies to theorem [ th17 ] below .",

    "in fact when @xmath123 , ( [ eq116 ] ) is valid with no restriction on @xmath124 and @xmath125 ; see remark  [ remark31 ] in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the condition @xmath126 leads to instantaneous complete gelation that will be discussed in theorem  [ th17 ] below .",
    "we finally turn to the question of complete gelation .",
    "define @xmath127    [ th17 ] assume that @xmath128 , for some @xmath98 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath129 such that @xmath130    [ remark15 ] in jeon @xcite it has been shown that a complete instantaneous gelation occurs if the requirement of theorem  [ th17 ] is satisfied .",
    "no bound on the time of complete gelation is provided in @xcite , and we believe that our proof is simpler .    even though our assumption on @xmath17 as it appears in theorem  [ th13 ] is the most commonly used condition to guarantee gelation , we now argue that it is the assumption of theorem  [ th16 ] that is more physically relevant . in a more realistic model for the coagulation phenomenon",
    "we would allow spatial dependence for particles .",
    "we are now interested on the evolution of particle density @xmath131 where @xmath132 represents the spatial position .",
    "the homogeneous se is now replaced with the inhomogeneous se , @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the diffusion coefficient of particles of size @xmath6 , the operator @xmath135 denotes the laplace operator in @xmath136 variable and @xmath137 has the same form as in the homogeneous se .",
    "microscopically , particles have positions , masses and radii .",
    "each particle travels as a brownian motion with diffusion coefficient @xmath138 where @xmath16 denotes the mass of the particle .",
    "particles may coagulate only when they are sufficiently close .",
    "for example , the coagulation occurs between particles of positions @xmath136 and @xmath139 only when @xmath140 is of order @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the radii of particles , and @xmath144 is a small parameter . when the dimension @xmath145 is @xmath146 or more , the initial number of particles is of order @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "when particles are close , they coagulate randomly with a rate that is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "this microscopic coagulation rate @xmath149 is not the macroscopic coagulation rate that appears in se .",
    "one can calculate the macroscopic coagulation rate @xmath150 from the microscopic coagulation rate @xmath17 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath151 after some potential theory .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for more details on this model and a precise formula of @xmath150 . in this model of coagulating brownian particles",
    ", a large microscopic coagulation rate would not lead to gelation .",
    "instead , the radii of particles are what matter when it comes to the issue of gelation . indeed ,",
    "if the relationship between the mass @xmath16 of a particle and its radius @xmath142 is given by @xmath152 , then for a gelation we need a condition of the form @xmath153 .",
    "this is quite understandable in view of theorem  [ th15 ] because for a uniformly positive @xmath17 , the macroscopic coagulation rate @xmath154 behaves like @xmath155 as @xmath16 and @xmath6 get large ; see  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if the diffusion coefficients @xmath156 are uniformly positive and @xmath153 , then @xmath150 has a super - linear growth as the size of particles get large . based on this we conjecture that an instantaneous gelation would occur if @xmath153 .",
