    "the klr algebras , or quiver hecke algebras , were constructed independently by khovanov and lauda @xcite and by rouquier @xcite , and have since received an abundance of interest .",
    "this is , in some part , due to the powerful result of brundan and kleshchev in @xcite that every ( degenerate ) ariki  koike algebra is isomorphic to a so - called cyclotomic quotient of a klr algebra .",
    "the klr algebras and their cyclotomic quotients are graded , and this allows us to study the graded representation theory of ( degenerate ) ariki  koike algebras , and in particular the graded representation theory of the symmetric groups .",
    "this motivates the study of klr algebras , and in particular the study of their graded specht modules .",
    "these were defined by brundan , kleshchev and wang @xcite , and developed further by kleshchev , mathas and ram @xcite , who gave a homogeneous presentation for each specht module .    in trying to understand the ( graded ) structure of the specht modules , the ( graded ) homomorphism spaces @xmath7",
    "are of particular interest . in the ungraded setting ,",
    "these homomorphism spaces have received a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "we concentrate in particular here on the row and column removal theorems for homomorphisms , proved by the first author and lyle @xcite for the symmetric group and generalised to hecke algebras of type @xmath8 by lyle and mathas . in this paper , we provide graded versions of these theorems , while at the same time generalising them to higher levels so that they apply to all ( degenerate ) ariki  koike algebras .",
    "in fact , our results apply not to all homomorphisms between two given specht modules but only to those of a certain type , which we call _ dominated _ homomorphisms .",
    "however , in many cases ( for example , for the symmetric group in odd characteristic ) every homomorphism between two specht modules is dominated , so our results apply generally ; in particular , via the brundan  kleshchev isomorphism mentioned above , we recover the original row and column removal theorems of lyle and mathas .",
    "we now summarise the structure of the paper . in [ backsec ] , we introduce the combinatorics necessary for our purposes , as well as the set - up of the klr algebras and their specht modules .",
    "we proceed in [ domsec ] by introducing _ dominated tableaux _ and the corresponding dominated homomorphisms .",
    "[ crhsec ] gives our main results pertaining to generalised column removal for homomorphisms .",
    "finally , in [ indsec ] we provide an index of notation for the reader s convenient reference .",
    "the second author would like to thank queen mary university of london , without whose funding this work would not have been possible .",
    "the second author must also thank professor andrew mathas , at the university of sydney , with whom this work began .",
    "the visit to the university of sydney was funded by the eileen colyer prize and the australian research council grant dp110100050 `` graded representations of hecke algebras '' .",
