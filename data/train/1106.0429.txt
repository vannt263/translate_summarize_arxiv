    "quickly summarized , the main outcome of the frg calculation is the magnetic spin susceptibility as the linear response to a small external magnetic field , calculated via kubos formula .",

    ", large response peaks can be seen at an @xmath119-point position ( due to the external magnetic field along one of the cubic axes the susceptibility profile loses its six fold rotation symmetry ) . upon entering the spiral regime",
    ", the ordering peak leaves the commensurate @xmath119 point and moves continuously towards the @xmath120 point . as one approaches the phase boundaries to the zig - zag phase , the ordering peaks broaden in @xmath121 direction and finally split into two separate peaks which mark the @xmath118-space positions of the commensurate zig - zag order .",
    "these peaks are located in the middle between the @xmath120 point and the corners of the extended brillouin zone .",
    "recall that there are also three distinct zig - zag ordering configurations corresponding to three differently oriented zig - zag paths in the hexagonal lattice .",
    "each of these configurations relates to two ordering peaks at @xmath118 and @xmath122 . as can be seen in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig - order ] the symmetry - breaking property of the external magnetic field only allows for two zig - zag ordering configurations , which corresponds to four peaks in the brillouin zone .",
    "finally , we turn to thermodynamic properties of model , in particular the suppression of magnetic ordering with regard to the curie - weiss temperature , which is often considered a measure of frustration and quantified by the frustration parameter @xmath123 , i.e. the ratio of the curie - weiss temperature @xmath7 and the ordering temperature @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - f ] , we again consider the case @xmath114 .",
    "the qualitative behavior of @xmath35 shown there is characteristic also for smaller and larger values of @xmath20 .",
    "the stripy ordered phase can clearly be identified as the region with the smallest frustration , which is in agreement with the fact that this order is classically saturated at @xmath114 , @xmath124 . as the boundary to the spiral phase",
    "is crossed , the frustration parameter undergoes a pronounced increase . in general",
    ", @xmath35 grows with increasing @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( at least if @xmath31 is not too large ) and the largest amount of frustration i s obtained near the transition line between spiral order and zig - zag order .",
    "hence , by adding @xmath30 and @xmath31 interactions , the frustration can be enhanced by a factor of three as compared to the bare heisenberg - kitaev case . as shown in fig .",
    "3 of the main text , @xmath35 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath20 , while the general profile of frustration in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane remains similar to fig .",
    "[ fig - f ] .",
    "however , depending on @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for small @xmath20 a non - magnetic phase may appear , which causes a sharp rise of the frustration parameter in the nearby ordered phases .",
    "hence , in regimes of small @xmath20 , the capability of @xmath30 and @xmath31 interactions to increase the frustration is most pronounced ."

[ fig - t - vs - alpha ] further indicate that the potentially counter - intuitive experimental observation of @xmath8 staying roughly the same in going from na@xmath4iro@xmath1 to li@xmath4iro@xmath1 even though @xmath7 decreases by a factor of @xmath80 in fact agrees well with our calculations showing that the ordering scale stays more or less constant for the zig - zag ordered ground state in the regime @xmath77 . finally , we note that our calculations also indicate that the frustration parameter @xmath9 decreases monotonically with @xmath20 in the region where magnetic order is found ( see the inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - t - vs - alpha ] ) , which is a direct consequence of the curie - weiss scale @xmath7 decreasing monotonically in this region . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for small @xmath20 the geometric frustration induced by the further nearest - neighbor exchange becomes more evident and the parameter @xmath35 reaches values much larger than obtained for the original hk model @xcite and in fact becomes comparable in size to what is observed experimentally for na@xmath4iro@xmath1 where @xmath29 .    to place the @xmath0iro@xmath1 materials on the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - t - vs - alpha ] we note that the zig - zag ordered ground state indicated in dft calculations for both materials is found only in the parameter range @xmath77 in the presence of significant second and third neighbor exchange . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , an enhanced frustration parameter @xmath35 is found only for small @xmath81 before the system transitions to a non - magnetic ground state ( for @xmath79 ) and the ordering temperature starts to drop drastically . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore place na@xmath4iro@xmath1 at @xmath82 . in contrast , li@xmath4iro@xmath1 with zig - zag order at @xmath83  k and @xmath28 can be placed at @xmath84 putting it considerably closer to the spin - liquid regime @xcite around the kitaev limit beyond @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that in going from the na to the li system the @xmath85 lattice parameters are reduced by @xmath86 while the @xmath87 parameter is reduced by @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , substituting na by li is equivalent to preferentially applying chemical pressure along the @xmath87 axis ( @xmath89 to the honeycomb planes ) . </S>",
    "<S> this most likely leads to the iro@xmath90 octahedra becoming more symmetrical within the @xmath91-plane which in turn enhances the parameters @xmath92 ( in the notation of ref .  ) </S>",
    "<S> leading to an increased kitaev coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the value of @xmath93 estimated above for li@xmath4iro@xmath1 which puts its closer to the kitaev limit .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that magnetic properties of the mott insulating iridates @xmath0iro@xmath1 , in particular the evolution of thermodynamic observables , i.e. the curie - weiss temperature @xmath7 and ordering temperature @xmath8 , as well as their low - temperature magnetic order can be captured within an extended heisenberg - kitaev model . </S>",
    "<S> our detailed comparison of experiment and theory in particular suggests that while na@xmath4iro@xmath1 is located deep in a magnetically ordered regime , li@xmath4iro@xmath1 lies close to the spin - liquid regime around the kitaev limit ( @xmath36 ) . </S>",
    "<S> future experiments will further investigate whether the application of @xmath87-axis pressure can push these systems deeper into the orbitally dominated regime , and in particular whether li@xmath4iro@xmath1 can be pushed into the spin - liquid phase .    </S>",
