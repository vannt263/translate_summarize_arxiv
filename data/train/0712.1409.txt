    "in this paper describing early results from the australia telescope large area survey ( atlas ) , we present a 1.4ghz survey of the european large area iso survey ( elais ) s1 field ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the second survey paper describing results from atlas , and is complementary to the paper by @xcite , which describes observations of the chandra deep field south .",
    "atlas is an ambitious study of galaxies and their evolution since z@xmath23 , using predominantly observations in the radio regime .",
    "two large areas ( about 3.5deg@xmath3 each ) have been surveyed with high sensitivity , using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 1.4ghz , to complement multi - wavelength observations in the infrared with the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "the immediate goals of the observations are , in brief , to determine whether the radio - infrared relation holds at high redshifts ; to search for overdensities of high - z ulirgs which mark the positions of protoclusters in the early universe ; to trace the radio luminosity function to high redshifts ; to determine the relative contribution of starbursts and agn to the overall energy density of the universe ; and to open a new parameter space to allow for serendipitous discovery of rare sources .",
    "however , surveys such as this have proven in the past to have a substantial impact on longer time - scales , when they are used as a resource in a broad variety of studies .",
    "it was decided early on in this project to observe two separate sky regions , rather than one larger area , to exclude cosmic variance which might affect the results .",
    "both fields extend beyond @xmath4 in one dimension , which is sufficient to sample structures at any one redshift which have evolved to more than 150mpc at the present epoch .",
    "nevertheless , such surveys are still prone to cosmic variance .",
    "the cdfs is known to contain some large - scale structures ( @xcite and references therein ) , predominantly at redshifts of 0.73 and 1.1 .",
    "these structures are not obvious clusters , but `` sheets '' in the original cdfs .",
    "this finding demonstrates the need to sample large areas for an unbiased view of galaxy formation .",
    "it should be noted that the elais - s1 field has been also observed by @xcite using the atca in june 1997 , reaching a fairly uniform rms of 80@xmath5  across the observed area , a factor of three higher than the average rms in our current observations . also , the area they observed is slightly larger than the field described here .",
    "we have cross - matched their sources to ours and briefly discuss the results .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes the observations and section  [ sec : images ] details the source extraction process and the cross - identification of radio sources with the swire catalogue .",
    "section  [ sec : cats ] provides a description of the catalogues and the literature search for counterparts in other surveys .",
    "section  [ sec : class ] gives a description of the classification and a few individual sources are described in more detail in section  [ sec : individual ] .",
    "we provide a short analysis of the radio - infrared relation in section  [ sec : r - ir ] and our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "as of december 2006 we have completed about 50% of the planned observations of the elais - s1 field .",
    "the sensitivity here is slightly higher than in the cdfs , partly because of slightly longer integration times ( between 10.5h per pointing and 13.5h per pointing , compared to 8.2h per pointing over most of the cdfs ) , and partly because there is a strong interfering source in the cdfs field .",
    "however , a 3.8jy source ( pks0033 - 44 ) limits the dynamic range of the elais - s1 observations even though it is well outside our pointings .",
    "an overview of the observed area is reproduced in figure  [ fig : overview ] .",
    "the radio observations were carried out on 27 separate days between 9 january 2004 and 24 june 2005 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , with a total net integration time on the pointings of 231h , in a variety of configurations to maximise the @xmath6 coverage ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) . however , @xmath6 coverage is probably not a crucial factor in aperture synthesis when the field is dominated by point sources as in our case .",
    "3.89deg@xmath3 in the elais - s1 field were analysed ( this is the total area in the mosaic where the primary beam response is @xmath7% ) in a mosaic consisting of 20 overlapping pointings ( table  [ tab : coords ] ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the primary beams at 1.4ghz is @xmath8 .",
    "the pointings were observed for one minute each , and the calibrator 0022 - 423 was observed after each cycle of 20 pointings for two minutes .",
    "amplitude calibration was done using pks1934 - 638 as a primary calibrator , which was observed for 10min before or after each observing run .",
    "it was assumed to have a flux density of 15.012jy at 1.34ghz and 14.838jy at 1.43ghz , corresponding to the centres of the two atca frequency bands .",
    "each band had a bandwidth of 128mhz over 33 channels , so the total observing bandwidth was 256mhz .",
    "in the observation in early 2004 , the higher band was only slightly affected by terrestrial radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) , but this deteriorated in 2004 , requiring considerable effort to edit the data properly to avoid losing a large fraction of good data .",
    "the lower band was mostly free of rfi and required little editing . in the early stages of the project in 2004 ,",
    "only pointings 1 - 12 were observed ( the upper three rows of circles in figure  [ fig : overview ] ) , but the surveyed area was extended in 2005 by adding pointings 13 - 20 to the field .",
    "the new pointings were initially observed for a longer time to catch up with the older pointings , resulting in a different @xmath6 coverage and a little more integration time .",
    "pointings 1 - 12 have net integration times of 10.5h per pointing , whereas pointings 13 - 20 have net integration times of 13.5h per pointing . after editing ,",
    "the predicted noise level is 22@xmath5  in the centre of the mosaic . towards the image edges , the noise level increases due to primary beam attenuation .",
    "the data were calibrated using miriad ( @xcite ) standard procedures , following recommendations for high dynamic range imaging .",
    "the raw data come in rpfits format , and are converted into the native miriad format using atlod .",
    "atlod discarded every other frequency channel ( which are not independent from one another , hence no information is lost ) and flagged one channel in the higher - frequency band which contained a multiple of 128mhz , and thus was affected by self - interference at the atca .",
    "we also did not use the channels at either end of the band where the sensitivity dropped significantly .",
    "the resulting data set contained two frequency bands , with 13 channels and 12 channels respectively , all of which are 8mhz wide , and so the total net bandwidth in the data was 25@xmath98mhz=200mhz .",
    "the data were bandpass - calibrated to prepare for rfi removal with pieflag ( @xcite ) .",
    "pieflag derives baseline - based statistics from a channel which is free of , or only very slightly affected by , rfi , and searches the other channels for outliers and sections of high noise .",
    "it is therefore important to bandpass - calibrate the data before using it .",
    "pieflag eliminated all rfi - affected data which would have been flagged in a visual inspection , while minimising the amount of erroneously flagged good data . on average ,",
    "approximately 3% and 15% of the data were flagged in the lower and higher band , respectively .",
    "after flagging , the bandpass calibration was removed as it may have been affected by rfi in the calibrator observations , and repeated .",
    "phase and amplitude fluctuations throughout each observing run were corrected using the interleaved calibrator scans , and the amplitudes were scaled by correction factors derived from the observations of the primary calibrator .",
    "the data were then split by pointing and imaged .",
    "the data for each of the 20 pointings were imaged separately using uniform weighting and a pixel size of @xmath10 .",
    "the 25 frequency channels were gridded separately to increase the @xmath6 coverage .",
    "the relatively high fractional bandwidth of the observations ( 15% ) required the use of miriad s implementation of multi - frequency clean , mfclean , for deconvolution , to account for spectral indices across the observed bandwidth and to reduce sidelobes .",
    "after a first iteration , model components with a flux density of more than @xmath11 were used in phase self - calibration , to correct residual phase errors .",
    "the data were then re - imaged and cleaned with 5000 iterations , at which point the sidelobes of strong sources were found to be well below the thermal noise .",
    "the models were convolved with a gaussian of @xmath12 diameter at position angle @xmath13 , and the residuals were added .",
    "the restored images of the 20 pointings were merged in a linear mosaic using the miriad task linmos , which divides each image by a model of the primary beam to account for the attenuation towards the edges of the image , and then uses a weighted average for pixels which are covered by more than one pointing . as a result , pixels at the mosaic edges have a higher noise level .",
    "regions beyond a perimeter where the primary beam response drops below 3% ( this occurs at a radius of @xmath14 from the centre of a pointing ) were blanked .",
    "imaging of the data turned out to be challenging , but the sensitivity of the image presented here is mostly within 25% of the predicted sensitivity . in the south - eastern corner of the mosaic",
    ", mild artefacts remain due to the presence of the 3.8jy radio source pks0033 - 44 , which is located about @xmath15 away from the centre of pointing 13 .",
    "the noise level of the present image could only be reached by including this source in the cleaned area .",
    "because of a combination of the high resolution of the image , the distance of the source from the pointing centre , and the requirement of multi - frequency clean to provide images which are three times larger than the area to clean , we had to generate very large images with 16384 pixels on a side , plus an additional layer of the same extent for the spectral index .",
    "these images can not be handled by 32-bit computers because the required memory exceeds their address space , and we had to employ a 64-bit machine to image the data .",
    "the cause of the residual sidelobes is still the subject of investigation . at present",
    ", we suspect that non - circularities in the sidelobe pattern of the primary beams are the culprit .",
    "the interfering source sits on the maximum of the first antenna sidelobe and , in the course of the observations , rotates through the sidelobe pattern due to the azimuthal mounting of the antennas .",
    "we have measured the primary beam response of two atca antennas in great detail using a geostationary satellite at 1.557ghz , and derived a model of their far - field reception patterns .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to reproduce the sidelobe pattern arising from pks0033 - 44 , and no correction from this exercise has been applied to our data .",
    "the sensitivity is not uniform across the image due to primary beam attenuation , however , it is quite homogeneous in the central 1deg@xmath3 of the image .",
    "a cumulative histogram of an image of the noise in this area , made with sextractor ( @xcite ) , revealed that only 2% of the image has a noise of 22@xmath5  or less , consistent with the theoretical expectations .",
    "however , 75% of pixels have a noise of 27.5@xmath5  or less , which is 25% higher than the expected noise .",
    "we conclude that in the regions which are not affected by sidelobes from pks0033 - 44 the sensitivity of the image is close to the theoretical expectations .",
    "clean bias is an effect in deconvolution which redistributes flux from point sources to noise peaks in the image , thereby reducing the flux density of the real sources . as the amount of flux which is taken away from real sources is independent of the sources flux densities , the fractional error this causes is largest for weak sources .",
    "the effect of clean bias in our calibration procedure has been analysed as follows .",
    "we have added to the data of one pointing ( rms=30@xmath5 ) 132 point sources at random positions , with flux densities between 150@xmath5  and 3mjy .",
    "the number of sources added with a particular snr were n=40 ( 5@xmath16 ) , 15 ( 6@xmath16 ) , 15 ( 7@xmath16 ) , 15 ( 8@xmath16 ) , 15 ( 9@xmath16 ) , 10 ( 10@xmath16 ) , 10 ( 12@xmath16 ) , 5 ( 16@xmath16 ) , 3 ( 20@xmath16 ) , 2 ( 30@xmath16 ) , 1 ( 50@xmath16 ) , and 1 ( 100@xmath16 ) .",
    "the data have then been used to form an image in the same way as the final image was made , and each source s flux density was extracted using a gaussian fit , and then divided by the injected flux density .",
    "this test was repeated 30 times to build up significant statistics , in particular for the sources with high snr .",
    "we found that using 5000 iterations in cleaning did not cause a significant clean bias ( @xmath17% ) , whereas using 50000 iterations did cause the extracted fluxes to be reduced by up to 5% ( figure  [ fig : clean_bias ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the flux densities in our catalogue are only marginally affected by clean bias .",
    "we have compared the flux densities and positions of components in our image to those of @xcite ( g99 ) .",
    "we have obtained their image and selected 83 isolated components with @xmath18mjy in regions where our noise level was below 30@xmath5 .",
    "all sources were detected with an snr@xmath196 by g99 .",
    "these sources were grouped into bins with @xmath20mjy to @xmath21mjy ( n=-1,0,1,2,3,4 ) , the flux densities were extracted from g99 s image using the same methods as for our image , and the ratios @xmath22 were computed .",
    "the median ratios were 1.36 ( 0.5mjy-1mjy ) , 1.43 ( 1mjy-2mjy ) , 1.19 ( 2mjy-4mjy ) , and 1.16 ( 4mjy-8mjy ) .",
    "the two highest bins with 8mjy-16mjy and 16mjy-32mjy had ratios very close to one , but only two measurements each , hence the statistics are not reliable .",
    "our analysis suggests that our flux densities are systematically higher than g99 s , although @xmath22 appears to approach unity towards higher flux densities .",
    "we have found that our flux extraction procedure reproduces the catalogued fluxes of g99 to within 3% , hence we conclude that our procedure is working and the effect is real",
    ". the cause of this discrepancy is not known , but possible explanations are ( i ) calibration differences : g99 used amplitude self - calibration with a relatively sparse array and very short solution intervals , which may have affected the flux densities .",
    "we did not use amplitude self - calibration at all because it was not found to improve our image significantly ; ( ii ) @xmath6 coverage : g99 had only one configuration at the atca whereas we had six , yielding more constraints in deconvolution .",
    "also g99 imaged the data from both if bands separately and averaged the images later , thus using only one half of their data in the deconvolution stage .",
    "we also tested for a systematic position offset between the components of g99 and ours .",
    "we found a mean offset of @xmath23 in right ascension and of @xmath24 in declination , and conclude that systematic position offsets are negligible .",
    "the _ spitzer _ observations of the elais - s1 field were carried out as part of the _ spitzer _ wide - area infra - red extragalactic survey ( swire ) program , as described by @xcite .",
    "approximately 6.9deg@xmath3 were observed in the elais - s1 region at 3.6@xmath25 , 4.5@xmath25 , 5.8@xmath25 , and 8.0@xmath25  with the infrared array camera ( irac ) and at 24@xmath25  with the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) .",
    "the sensitivities in the five bands are 4.1@xmath5 , 8.5@xmath5 , 48.2@xmath5 , 53.0@xmath5 , and 252@xmath5 . here",
    "we use the fourth data release , containing more than 400.000 sources ( surace et al .",
    "2007 , in prep . ) .",
    "the optical follow - up observations of the elais - s1 field are called the eso - spitzer imaging extragalactic survey ( esis ) .",
    "the observations were carried out with the wide field imager ( wfi ) of the 2.2 m la  silla eso - mpi telescope and with the visible multi object spectrograph ( vimos ) on the vlt , to cover 5deg@xmath3 in bvriz .",
    "only approximately 1.5deg@xmath3 have yet been covered ( @xcite ) with wfi and these data are included in our catalogue .",
    "the filters used are wfi b/99 ( later replaced by b/123 ) , v/89 and rc/162 , and the catalogue is 95% complete at 25@xmath26 in the b and v bands , and at 24.5@xmath26 in the r band ( all in vega units ) .",
    "this section describes the procedure we used to extract radio sources from the image and to subsequently match these radio sources to infrared sources . in our terminology ,",
    "a radio component is a region of radio emission which is best described by a gaussian .",
    "close radio doubles are very likely to be best represented by two gaussians and are therefore deemed to consist of two components . single or multiple components are called a radio source if they are deemed to belong to the same object .",
    "the rms of the image varies from 22@xmath5  in the best regions to 1mjy towards the edges of the image , caused by primary beam attenuation .",
    "it is therefore not possible to use the same cutoff , in terms of flux density per pixel , above which a pixel is deemed a detection of a source and below which pixels are deemed noise .",
    "furthermore , flux densities measured towards the image edges are increasingly affected by uncertainties in the primary beam model , and we therefore restricted our image analysis to those sources which lie in regions where the theoretical sensitivity is below 250@xmath5 .",
    "we used sextractor to create an image of the noise , by which we divided the radio image to obtain an image of signal - to - noise ( called the snr map ) .",
    "the snr map has unity noise everywhere , and can be analysed using a single criterion .",
    "we used the miriad task imsad to look for islands of snr@xmath195 , and then used this catalogue as input for a visual inspection of the total intensity image at the locations where snr@xmath195 .",
    "sources were re - fitted using the total intensity image , and were subsequently cross - identified with ir sources and classified .",
    "if either of the two axes of a fitted gaussian was smaller than the restoring beam s corresponding axis , the fit was repeated using a gaussian with the major and minor axis fixed to the restoring beam and the position angle set to zero .",
    "also very weak sources were in general found to be better represented with fixed - size gaussians .",
    "the integrated flux densities of extended sources were obtained by integrating over the source area , rather than summing the flux densities of their constituents .",
    "this is because even multiple gaussians are seldom a proper representation of extended sources , and , using this technique , even very faint emission between components is included .",
    "we estimated the error of the integrated flux densities using eq .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite , which is based on @xcite , assuming a relative error of the flux calibration of 5% whereas @xcite assumed 1% . in the case of extended sources , where the integrated flux density was measured by integrating over a polygon in the image",
    ", we assumed a 5% scaling error and added to that in quadrature an empirical error arising from the shape and size of the area over which was integrated :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the flux density in jy .",
    "for extended sources with 10mjy , 1mjy and 0.5mjy , the total errors are thus 0.5mjy ( 5% ) , 0.11mjy ( 11% ) , and 0.2mjy ( 40% ) , respectively , which describe the errors found empirically reasonably well .",
    "the uncertainties in the peak flux densities were estimated using eq .",
    "( 21 ) in @xcite .",
    "errors in right ascension and declination are the formal errors from gaussian fits plus a @xmath29 uncertainty from the calibrator position added in quadrature .",
    "all radio components were deconvolved from the restoring beam .",
    "if a deconvolution was not possible , or the deconvolution yielded a point source , the component was deemed to be unresolved and the deconvolved size has been left blank in table  [ tab : radio1 ] .",
    "the cross - matching process was as follows .",
    "the region used for the fit and the ellipse indicating the fwhm were inspected , along with the corresponding parts of the following images : the snr map , a naturally weighted radio image with lower resolution ( and slightly higher sensitivity ) , a superuniformly weighted radio image with higher resolution ( but lower sensitivity ) , and the 3.6@xmath25  swire image with superimposed snr map contours .",
    "furthermore , the locations of catalogued swire sources within @xmath30 of the fitted coordinates were shown on the swire images .",
    "it was then decided ( i ) whether each radio component was a genuine detection or likely to be a sidelobe , ( ii ) how it could be matched to catalogued or uncatalogued swire sources , ( iii ) whether multiple radio components constituted radio emission from a single object , and ( iv ) whether extended components needed to be divided into sub - components . emission deemed to be sidelobes was found predominantly towards the edges of the image and associated with , and directly adjacent to , strong sources .",
    "most sidelobes were discovered because the naturally - weighted image , which has a different sidelobe pattern and higher sensitivity but lower resolution , showed no evidence of a source at the position of a possible source in the uniformly weighted image .",
    "our catalogue of radio components contains 1366 components ; 15 were deemed to be sidelobes and have been marked as such ( all with snr@xmath316 ) , leaving 1351 genuine radio components .",
    "the separation between a radio component and a swire source can not easily be used as a parameter in the cross - identification process . in some cases , despite a relatively large separation , the cross - identification is relatively clear because the swire source is extended towards the swire source , such as in the examples shown in figure  [ fig : large_sep ] .",
    "1134 radio components ( 88.9% ) could be characterized properly by a single gaussian and were judged to be the only radio counterpart of a catalogued swire source .",
    "a fraction of these displayed the morphology of doubles in a superuniformly weighted image .",
    "15 sources ( 1.2% ) had uncatalogued swire counterparts .",
    "32 sources ( 2.5% ) were deemed to be radio doubles , consisting of two radio components ; and 26 sources ( 2.0% ) consisted of two or more components , displaying more complex morphologies like triplets or core - jet morphologies .",
    "we have tested for systematic radio - ir position offsets by calculating the average offsets of 533 sources which consist of a single radio component and a catalogued swire counterpart , and have snr@xmath1910 .",
    "the offsets have a mean of @xmath32 in right ascension and @xmath33 in declination .",
    "although the offset is formally significantly different from zero , we note that it is less than a tenth of a pixel in the radio image .",
    "all sources classified as radio doubles have been reviewed using the criteria developed by @xcite based on an analysis of the first survey ( @xcite ) : two radio components are likely to be part of a double when ( a ) their separation measured in arcsec is less than @xmath34 , where s is the total flux of the two constituents , and ( b ) their flux densities do not differ by more than a factor of four . we give the results of this test in the source table . it should be noted that the test has been derived from a large sample of galaxies ( 236000 ) and is purely empirical .",
    "furthermore , the first survey is shallower ( rms=0.14mjy ) than ours , and so statistically may contain different objects from the survey presented here .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that some of our radio sources which are clearly radio doubles fail the test .",
    "for example , s923 ( figure  [ fig : examples ] ) fails on criterion ( a ) , but satisfies criterion ( b ) .",
    "because the swire field has a high ir source density ( 58700 sources per deg@xmath3 ) , there is some chance that a radio component falls within a few arcseconds of an infrared source , although it is not physically connected to it .",
    "the two sources would be wrongly cross - matched , and hence there is a fraction of erroneous cross - identifications in our source catalogue , an upper limit of which we estimate as follows .    from the source density",
    ", one can calculate that on average 0.01423 swire sources fall within @xmath35 of any one point in the field .",
    "the number of swire sources within @xmath36 of any one point is 0.0427 , and within @xmath37 is 0.0711 .",
    "we have confirmed these numbers experimentally by searching near several hundred random positions in the swire catalogue .",
    "in our catalogue , 1134 sources consist of a single component and have a good swire cross - identification . of these",
    ", 656 have a separation of less than @xmath35 , 350 have a separation of @xmath36 , 86 have a separation of @xmath37 , and 45 have a separation of more than @xmath38 .    of the original 1134 cross - identifications , a fraction of 0.01423 , or 16 sources ,",
    "are expected to be purely coincidental , and are found among the 656 sources with sub - arcsec cross - identifications .",
    "thus , a fraction of @xmath39 is likely to be coincidental ( and wrong ) .    with the sub - arcsec cross - identifications now accounted for , @xmath40 sources remain .",
    "of these , a fraction of 0.0427 , or 20 sources , will fall within @xmath36 of an infrared source by coincidence .",
    "thus , a fraction of @xmath41 is coincidental .",
    "repeating the steps above leaves @xmath42 sources which have not yet been cross - identified .",
    "putting 128 sources randomly on the swire image yields a coincidental counterpart within @xmath37 for a fraction of 0.0711 , or 9 sources .",
    "thus , a fraction of @xmath43 is coincidental .",
    "the statistics of the remaining 45 sources with separations @xmath44 are not meaningful because the separations are dominated by extended radio objects which are not expected to coincide with infrared sources .",
    "a summary of this estimate is shown in table  [ tab : fxids ] .",
    "we stress that the rates of false cross - identifications given here are upper limits .",
    "a false cross - identification does not only require a false counterpart within a few arcseconds of the radio position , but it also requires that the true counterpart is much fainter than the false one .",
    "the second requirement reduces the rate of false cross - identifications well below our estimate .",
    "following @xcite we publish two catalogues , one containing the component data ( table  [ tab : radio1 ] ) , and one containing radio sources and their infrared counterparts ( table  [ tab : source1 ] ) .",
    "the component catalogue contains information about gaussian components fitted to the radio image .",
    "it does not contain information about the grouping of components to sources , which is exclusively left to the source catalogue in the next section .",
    "the distribution of integrated flux densities for the 1276 catalogued sources is shown in figure  [ fig : fluxes ] .",
    "we have carried out a kolmogorov - smirnov - test using the elais - s1 and cdfs integrated flux densities , to test the likelihood that the two samples are drawn from the same parent distribution . because the two fields have different sensitivities ,",
    "the catalogues can not be compared in full , but a flux cutoff has to be used .",
    "furthermore , we restricted the test to sources within @xmath45 of the field centres and required an rms of between 30@xmath5  to 40@xmath5 , to exclude regions with elevated noise levels towards the image edges .",
    "we find that when only sources with flux densities of more than 0.5mjy are compared ( elais - s1 : 137 sources , cdfs : 130 sources ) , the probability that the two samples are drawn from the same parent distribution is 73.7% . when the minimum required flux density is lowered to 0.4mjy ( elais - s1 : 179 sources , cdfs : 151 sources ) or 0.3mjy ( elais - s1 : 222 sources , cdfs : 186 sources ) , the probabilities are 18.3% and 25.8% , respectively .",
    "we conclude that in regions with similar sensitivities the distribution of radio sources in the elais - s1 and cdfs fields is identical at a flux density level of more than 0.3mjy .    in the source catalogue , comments on the cross - match and the radio morphology",

    "we also comment on the radio morphology if the source is anything but a single gaussian . in the case of multiple - component sources",
    "we give the component numbers which were deemed to be associated with the source , and we comment on extension or blending with other radio sources .",
    "the coordinates of sources are generally those of the radio observations , but in the case of sources with more than one component and with a clear ir counterpart , the swire coordinates have been adopted as the source position . in the case of more than one component without a clear ir component",
    "the flux - weighted mean of the radio components has been used .",
    "the elais - s1 region has already been surveyed with the atca at 1.4ghz by @xcite with a @xmath46 sensitivity of 80@xmath5 , and we have cross - matched their catalogue to ours , resulting in 366 matches .",
    "we have also searched the nasa extragalactic database for objects within @xmath47 of the sources in our catalogue , and found matches to 105 sources , sometimes with multiple names .",
    "we mostly give the designations from the elais 15@xmath25  catalogue ( @xcite ) , the apmuks catalogue ( @xcite ) , and the 2mass catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "these cross - identifications have been included in table  [ tab : source1 ] .",
    "we searched for available redshifts and found that 59 objects within @xmath47 of our sources had catalogued redshifts , mostly from @xcite .",

    "we have cross - matched our source catalogue to sources from the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss , @xcite ) , which is a survey of the southern sky at 843mhz , using the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) .",
    "the sensitivity of sumss is of the order of @xmath48 , so that the faintest sources have a flux density of the order of @xmath49 . assuming a spectral index of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , typical for radio emission from agn , this corresponds to @xmath52 ,",

    "radio sources exhibiting a double - lobed , triple , or more complex structures , e.g. with jets , were generally classified as agn .",

    "here , sources with @xmath54 , i.e. more than 10 times the radio flux density as predicted by the radio - infrared relation , were classified as agn .    in total 75 sources",
    "were classified as agn based on their radio morphology , 128 sources based on their radio excess compared to the radio - infrared relation at 24@xmath25 , and 9 sources had been classified as agn by @xcite , based on optical spectroscopy .",
    "14 sources were classified as agn using more than one criterion , and thus 198 sources were classified as agn .",
    "we note that , with the exception of the three sources s606 , s717 , and s813 , all sources which were classified as agn based on their morphology _ and _ which had catalogued 24@xmath25  flux densities were also classified as agn based on their departure from the radio - infrared relation as given by @xcite .",
    "we plot the 20 cm flux densities as a function of 24@xmath25  flux densities of all sources in figure  [ fig : radio - ir ] .",
    "agn are plotted separately according to how they have been classified .",
    "we find 31 sources with no detectable infrared counterpart .",
    "these sources have been dubbed `` infrared - faint radio sources '' , or ifrs , by @xcite , and may be more extreme cases of the `` optically invisible radio sources '' found by @xcite . as they are invisible in the optical and infrared ,",
    "there is only very limited information available .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test reveals a 80.1% probability that the distribution of flux densities of the ifrs is drawn from the same parent distribution as all flux densities , though the ifrs sources tend to have lower radio flux densities than the entire sample .",
    "we have carried out vlbi observations of three ifrs in our sample ( s427 , @xmath55 ; s509 , @xmath56 ; and s775 , @xmath57 ) to determine whether they are agn hosts and the contribution to the arcsec - scale flux density from an agn , but the results are not yet available .",

    "the nearby source s829.2 is a relatively weak radio source ( 0.30mjy ) which coincides ( @xmath58 ) with swire4_j003251.87 - 433016.7 . *",
    "_ sources s923 , s930 , s930.1 and s926 _ these four sources lie within less than @xmath59 of each other and form a striking quartet at first sight .",
    "source s923 is without doubt a classical double - lobed radio galaxy with an integrated flux density of 5.9mjy .",
    "the swire source swire4_j003042.10 - 432335.4 is located on the line connecting the peaks of the two constituent radio components c923 and c931 and is therefore identified as the infrared counterpart .",
    "source s930 is an otherwise inconspicuous radio source with an infrared counterpart , swire4_j003038.21 - 432305.9 , within @xmath60 .",
    "the naturally weighted image indicates a faint bridge of emission between components c930 and c941 , hence both components have been grouped into s930 .",
    "it blends with source s930.1 , which consists of the two faint radio components c930.1 and c930.2 with integrated flux densities of 0.47mjy and 0.55mjy , respectively . in between components",
    "c930.1 and c930.2 is a very faint , uncatalogued infrared source , and thus the radio morphology together with the location of the ir source indicates that this is a double - lobed radio galaxy .",
    "source s655 has a relatively bright ir counterpart ( swire4_j003035.03 - 432341.6 ) centred on the brighter one of its two radio components c926 and c926.1 , with 2.7mjy and 0.93mjy , respectively . unlike in sources s923 and s930.1 ,",
    "the ir source is centred on one of its constituents , but it was deemed more likely that both c926 and c926.1 are associated with this source rather than to postulate that c926 is the radio counterpart to swire4_j003035.03 - 432341.6 and that c926.1 is a separate source with no ir counterpart . *",
    "_ sources s1189 and s1197 _ source s1189 is a beautifully extended , large radio source .",

    "the brightest part of s1189 is centred on swire4_j003427.54 - 430222.5 ( separation @xmath61 ) , which we therefore identify as ir counterpart , and which has the morphology of an elliptical galaxy in optical images .",
    "source s1197 , @xmath62 from swire4_j003419.55 - 430151.7 , is unlikely to be connected to s1189 .",
    "s1189 has the shape and extent of wide - angle tail galaxies ( wat , @xcite ) such as ngc1265 ( @xcite ) .",
    "their characteristic c - shape is believed to be caused by ram pressure against the jets while the galaxy is moving through the intracluster medium .",
    "the jets in s1189 are strongly bent backwards and almost touch another at the far ends .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig:1189 ] , where we have drawn contours beginning at @xmath63 to emphasize the effect .",
    "wat radio sources can be used as cluster signposts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but there is no known cluster at the position of s1189 , although there is a little overdensity of galaxies at @xmath64 to its south - west , centred on a bright galaxy with elliptical morphology .",
    "the source is in the sumss catalogue with a flux density of 36.2mjy , compared to a 1.4ghz flux density of 45.0mjy .",
    "however , it is clearly extended in the sumss image and not well represented by a gaussian .",
    "integrating over the source area in the sumss image yielded a total flux density of 51mjy , and hence a spectral index of @xmath65 . * _ source s1192 _ this source is an example of a triple radio galaxy .",
    "it consists of the three components c1192 , c1192.1 , and c1192.2 with mjy flux densities .",
    "the brightest component , c1192.1 , is centred on the ir source swire4_j003320.68 - 430203.6 .",
    "the other two components are several arcsec away from the nearest ir sources , and the overall morphology thus indicates that this is a bent triple radio galaxy .",
    "it therefore also could be a wat . * _ source s773 _ source s773 is a rather faint radio source with @xmath66 , but it has a very bright infrared counterpart with @xmath67 within @xmath68 , and is one of the few objects clearly visible in the swire 70@xmath25image .",
    "its unusual ratio of @xmath69 lets it clearly stand out in figure  [ fig : radio - ir ] as a separated dot in the bottom right corner .",
    "it has been classified by @xcite as a type 1 agn ( based on optical line widths in excess of 1200km / s ) at redshift 0.143 .",

    "survey of the elais - s1 region .",
    "* _ source s1081 _ source s1081 is a very extended ( @xmath70 ) , low - surface brightness source .",
    "nevertheless , its integrated flux density is 2.4mjy , and there is no obvious association with any one of the many nearby infrared sources .",
    "it is unlikely to be a sidelobe , as this region of the image is very good and free of artefacts .",
    "furthermore , its extent indicates that it is not a noise spike , which would have a similar size as the restoring beam .",
    "we have convolved the radio image of @xcite with a @xmath71 restoring beam , to increase its sensitivity to extended structures , but their image was not sensitive enough to confirm or refute the reality of s1081 .",
    "the nature of this object is unclear : given its size and the lack of a strong component it could be a cluster radio relic .",
    "such objects are interpreted as leftovers of cluster mergers .",

    "@xcite present an extensive description of the analysis and of simulations , and we refer the reader to their paper for details .",
    "we note , however , that the discrepancy of the value of @xmath74 found by @xcite and @xcite remains unresolved .",

    "we also indicate on the diagram the distribution ( also without k - correction ) found by @xcite .",
    "we note that these authors also presented a k - correction for their data , but it was too small to reconcile their result with the result by @xcite .",
    "the tail towards lower values of @xmath74 can be explained as arising from agn , which have a radio excess and so do not obey the radio - infrared relation .",
    "conversely , the sharp cutoff of the histogram at @xmath74 is caused by a lack of objects with an infrared excess .",
    "this is expected when one interprets the infrared emission as arising from star formation , which in turn generates radio emission according to the radio - infrared relation .",
    "@xcite excluded agn based on spectroscopic observations and thus their sample is not contaminated by agn , and they do not see the tail towards low values of @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the distribution of @xmath74 found by @xcite has a different shape than ours .",
    "it is rather constant between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and indicates a double - peaked distribution .",
