    "with the recent observational discovery of magnetars , which are assumed to be strongly magnetized young neutron stars and also the possible sources of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) @xcite , the study on the effect of strong magnetic fields on dense stellar matter has got a new dimension . in the recent years a lot of work have been done on the effect of strong magnetic field on the equation of state of dense stellar matter @xcite .",
    "some studies have also been done on the effect of strong magnetic field on elementary processes ( e.g. , weak and electromagnetic processes ) occurring at the core region as well as at the envelope of strongly magnetized neutron stars @xcite . during the past few years ,",
    "in a number of publications we have reported our thorough investigations on the effect of strong magnetic field on the stability of dense quark matter and quark - hadron phase transition ( both first order and second order ) at the core of a strongly magnetized neutron star @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the effect of strong magnetic field on dense neutron matter with properly modifying the @xmath0-meson type mean - field theory . in those work",
    "we have developed the relativistic version of mean field theory in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field using hartree and hartree - fock model with @xmath1 mesons exchange interaction @xcite .    in the recent years",
    "the transport coefficients in particular , the electrical conductivity of electrons at the crustal region of neutron stars have also been calculated in presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in none of these studies the dense core region of the star is taken into account . now from the observational data of sgr and axp , the strength of surface magnetic field of magnetars are predicted to be @xmath2 g .",
    "then it is very easy to show by scalar virial theorem that the magnetic field strength at the core region may go up to @xmath3 g .",
    "this is of course strong enough to affect most of the physical processes occurring at the core region . as a consequence , one of the most important physical phenomena , the transport properties of dense core matter ,",
    "in particular , the electrical conductivity of electrons and transport properties of emitted neutrinos will be affected significantly by the strong magnetic field . to investigate the transport properties of dense matter at the core of a neutron star , we use the standard form of boltzmann kinetic equation with relaxation time approximation . since protons are too heavy compared to electrons",
    ", we have assumed that the electric current is solely due to the motion of electrons .",
    "now the relaxation time is directly related to the rates of the relevant ( weak and electromagnetic ) processes .",
    "these processes are strongly affected by the presence of quantizing magnetic field . as a consequence , both qualitative and the quantitative nature of transport coefficients , e.g. , electrical conductivity , viscosity and",
    "heat conductivity should change significantly in presence of strong magnetic field . in a future publication",
    "we shall report the effect of strong magnetic field on the transport properties of neutrinos at the core region @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we shall investigate the effect of strong magnetic field on the electrical conductivity at the core region of strongly magnetized neutron stars or magnetars .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner : in section 2 , we obtain the rates of the relevant processes in presence of strong magnetic field . in section 3",
    ", we shall derive an expression for the electrical conductivity from boltzmann kinetic equation using relaxation time approximation . in the last section , we have given the conclusion and discussed the future perspective of the work .",
    "to obtain electrical conductivity at the core of a magnetar , we have considered the following two electromagnetic processes relevant for electron transport : electron - electron scattering @xmath4 and electron - proton scattering @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the initial and final four momenta .",
    "since the rate of the electron - neutrino weak scattering , given by @xmath8 is several orders of magnitude less than the electromagnetic processes , it has almost no significance in the electrical conductivity calculation .",
    "of course , this is one of the most important neutrino transport processes .",
    "for the same reason , we have neglected @xmath9 weak scattering .    to obtain electrical conductivity at the core of a magnetar ,",
    "we first consider e - e scattering .",
    "for this process , both the direct as well as exchange diagrams are considered . from the definition ,",

    "now in the case , when only the zeroth landau levels are occupied by the electrons the positive energy dirac spinor is given by @xmath15\\nonumber \\\\   & & \\left ( \\frac{eb}{\\pi}\\right ) ^{1/4 } \\exp   \\left [ -\\frac{1}{2 } eb \\left ( x-\\ \\frac{p}{eb}\\right ) ^2\\right ] \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\varepsilon_0+m\\\\ 0\\\\ p_z\\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the lengths along @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions , @xmath20 is the modified form of single particle energy , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 components of electron momentum , @xmath23 is the strength of magnetic field , assumed to be along positive @xmath19-direction ( we have chosen the gauge @xmath24 ) .",
    "the counter part of this spinor has no contribution when only the zeroth landau level is occupied . whereas , for low temperature case ( the chemical potential @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the temperature of the system . in the numerical calculation",

    "we shall use these differential rates ( eqns.(20 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 24 ) and @xmath89 ) to obtain the electrical conductivity .",
    "to compute the electrical conductivity of the magnetized stellar matter , we consider the simplest form of boltzmann kinetic equation for electrons which are assumed to be slightly out of local thermodynamic equilibrium .",

    "when only the zeroth landau levels ( @xmath103 ) are occupied by the electrons , the transverse momentum becomes exactly zero .",
    "we now consider the first order approximation , i.e. , the system is very close to its local equilibrium configuration , then we can write @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a measure of its deviation from local statistical equilibrium configuration",
    ". then we have @xmath106 , where @xmath107 s are the equilibrium distribution function for the @xmath108th component ( fermi distribution ) .",
    "the we can write @xmath109 expressing the force term in the form , @xmath110 we have after using eqn.(3 ) @xmath111 then just by inspection , it is very easy to realize that the relaxation time is obtained by evaluating the integrals over @xmath112 and @xmath113 in the expressions for the rates and the relation with the total rate of the processes is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 therefore , @xmath116 the well know matthiessen s rule @xcite . now",
    "the expression for electric current is given by @xmath117 because of randomness in the system , the local current vanishes at equilibrium .",
    "then the nonzero part of electric current is obtained by using the first order deviation @xmath118 and is given by @xmath119 in presence of a strong magnetic field of strength @xmath120 , the quantum limit of magnetic field , where @xmath121 g , we have @xmath122 . then writing ohm s law in the form @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 which is second rank tensor with the components @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "since we are interested for @xmath129 case only , i.e. , when the lowest landau levels are populated , we have @xmath130 and @xmath131 which is the only non - zero component .",
    "the electron transport in this special case becomes essentially one dimensional- along the direction of magnetic field .    in fig.(1 )",
    "we have plotted the variation of @xmath125 with electron density for ( a)@xmath132 , ( b)@xmath133 , ( c)@xmath134 , ( d)@xmath135 and ( e ) @xmath136 , where @xmath137 g , the quantum limit for electrons . in fig.(2 ) we have shown the variation of the nonzero component of electrical conductivity @xmath125 with magnetic field strength for ( a)@xmath138 , ( b)@xmath139 , ( c)@xmath140 , and ( d)@xmath141 , where @xmath142@xmath143 , the typical electron density in a non - magnetic neutron star . in both these cases we have not taken @xmath144 equilibrium condition into account .",
    "the density of electron is in some sense arbitrary .",
    "therefore , we now consider an interacting @xmath145 system in @xmath144-equilibrium , which is the real physical picture at the core region of a neutron star",
    ". then we have @xmath146 , the charge neutrality condition , @xmath147 , the @xmath144-equilibrium condition ( we assume that the neutrinos are non - degenerate , leave the system as soon as they are produced ) and baryon number density @xmath148 remains invariant in electromagnetic and weak interaction processes . solving these constraints self - consistently at the core of a magnetar , we obtain the chemical potential of the constituents and hence the density of electrons for various baryon densities and magnetic field strengths .",
    "we have assumed a fixed temperature @xmath27mev . in fig.(3 ) we have shown the variation of @xmath125 with the strength of magnetic field for a fixed baryon number density ( in the numerical computation we have taken @xmath149 , @xmath150@xmath143 ) assuming that the system is in @xmath144-equilibrium . in fig.(4 ) we have plotted @xmath125 against the electron density for a fixed magnetic field strength ( @xmath151 ) in @xmath144-equilibrium condition .",
    "we have studied the electrical conductivity at the core of a magnetar using boltzmann kinetic equation with the relaxation time approximation .",
    "the latter is obtained from the rates of the electromagnetic processes , which essentially control the electron transport in the medium .",
    "we have further noticed that the electrical conductivity behaves like a second rank tensor above the critical value ( quantum limit ) of magnetic field strength .",
    "however , only @xmath125 components is non - zero when the lowest landau levels are occupied by the charged particles .",
    "the system effectively becomes one - dimensional in presence of quantizing magnetic field- electrons can move along the field direction .",
    "the electric current vanishes in the plane transverse to the direction of magnetic field .",
    "since it is impossible to compute the rates analytically ( even it is very difficult to obtain numerically ) with the non - zero values of landau quantum numbers for all the four charged particles , we have assumed that only the zeroth landau levels are occupied .",
    "this makes our like much simpler .",
    "the assumption of only zero landau quantum number is also justified by the presence of intense magnetic field at the core region of magnetars .",
    "fig.(1 ) shows that there exist cut off densities , beyond which , the pauli blocking factor supresses the electron scattering and as a result the conductivity becomes zero .",
    "this figure also shows that the cut off density increases with the increas of magnetic field strength . as the magnetic field increases , for a given baryon number density , the chemical potential of electrons decreases , which further reduces the pauli suppression factor .",
    "similarly , we have noticed from fig.(2 ) that there is a minimum value for magnetic field strength for a particular baryon number density below which the conductivity again becomes zero because of same reason as discussed above . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath144-equilibrium condition ,",
    "electrons are generated self - consistently .",
    "so there are no such cut off values for the density or magnetic field and the variation is smooth .",
