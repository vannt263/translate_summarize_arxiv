    "these show that the decay of current with @xmath12 is sub - diffusive , decaying slower than @xmath155 , for @xmath141 but has approached diffusive behaviour once @xmath156 .",
    "formally a dark - state @xmath157 of an open quantum system is a pure state which is simultaneously an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath158 and a zero - eigenvalue eigenstate of all the jump operators comprising the dissipator @xmath159 describing noise acting on the system .",
    "here we show that deep in the strongly - interacting limit @xmath77 , with fully polarised driving @xmath45 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , there exists a state @xmath98 which , as the system size @xmath12 grows , becomes exponentially close to satisfying these requirements and is thus an approximate dark state .        in the extreme @xmath160 limit configuration states such as @xmath161 , where the particle occupancy on each site of the chain is explicitly specified ,",
    "are exact eigenstates of @xmath79 .",
    "a key property of boundary driving is that for any value of @xmath6 , it only incoherently connects configurations within a quadraplet of states @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is any length @xmath164 occupancy bit string .",
    "thus , if @xmath163 has @xmath165 1 s then the driving couples states within the total number sectors @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",

    "[ fig1](b ) , at @xmath45 within each quadruplet , defined by @xmath163 , there is one configuration @xmath168 which , owing to the occupancy on the left and empty site on the right , is entirely decoupled from the driving , while also being the sink for all driving transitions . as a result",
    "the effect of this incoherent evolution alone is to eventually drive all the population among the quadraplet of states into this _ dark - configuration_.    of particular relevance here are the dark - configurations possessing an @xmath80 particle domain pinned to the left boundary as @xmath169 for each particle number sector @xmath80 the configuration @xmath93 is separated from other relevant configurations by an energy gap @xmath170 , akin to a domain binding energy .",

    "the highest lying eigenstate @xmath78 for each sector is also highlighted .",
    "its properties are readily determined by treating hopping as a perturbation . specifically , to lowest - order in @xmath173 hopping hybridizes , across an energy gap of @xmath3 , the state @xmath93 with the configuration @xmath174 , where the outermost particle of the domain has broken away . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) the pattern of incoherent driving transitions and coherent hopping for @xmath175 is illustrated .",
    "we note that in this case @xmath176 has no direct coherent transition to any configurations which couples to the @xmath45 driving .",
    "more generally , so long as @xmath177 and @xmath178 we observe that the break - away configuration for a domain state @xmath93 is also a dark configuration of its own quadraplet .",
    "this approach can be taken further by computing higher - order corrections due to hopping . since @xmath77",
    "it is instructive to do this approximately by focusing on states of the form @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 , which describe a single break - away particle or hole propagating from the domain wall .",
    "since the repeated action of hopping on @xmath93 originates around the domain wall , and is also detuned by the gap @xmath3 , we find that hopping mixes in configurations where the particle and/or hole have hopped @xmath182 times in total , with an amplitude scaling as @xmath183 .",
    "this indicates that the particle / hole propagation is suppressed with its distance from the domain wall through the unit - filled / empty regions . for each @xmath80 , the eigenstate @xmath78 is therefore predicted by the particle - hole picture to have a domain wall that remains exponentially localized at site @xmath80 , within a length scale @xmath184  @xcite , and a deviation @xmath185 from the perfect domain configuration @xmath93 given by @xmath186 the validity of this picture is established by comparing this to the actual density deviation @xmath185 of the exact eigenstate @xmath78 . in fig .",

    "since hopping predominately connects @xmath93 with dark - configurations of the form @xmath168 , the leading order contribution to the amplitude in @xmath78 for a configuration which is not dark is @xmath199 .",
    "this corresponds to whether the hole or particle has the shortest path to the left or right boundary , respectively . in the @xmath77 limit",
    "we therefore conclude that the eigenstates @xmath78 , with @xmath200 , form a hierarchy of states with @xmath80 , characterised by a decreasing amplitude for any configuration coupling to the @xmath45 boundary driving .",
    "eigenstates @xmath78 with a domain size @xmath80 scaling with @xmath12 thus become exponentially close to being zero eigenstates of the @xmath45 driving with increasing system size . of these states the one with @xmath84 , where the domain spans exactly half the chain , has",
    "the most suppressed coupling @xmath201 to the driving and is thus the closest approximation of all of them to an exact dark state .",
    "next , we examine the expected structure of the non - equilibrium stationary state ( ness ) @xmath19 in the @xmath77 limit .",
    "the open dynamics of particle number conserving systems like that considered here have been studied extensively  @xcite with regard to their ergodic and mixing properties establishing that a unique ness exists for any @xmath6 . the key property ensuring this is that for a finite hopping amplitude every configuration within each particle number sector can be reached from any other , while the incoherent ejection / injection of particles by the driving connects neighbouring sectors . as a result the complete state space of the system can be accessed .",

    "while the discussion of the driven interacting system considered has revolved mainly around its ness properties , the existence of approximate dark states at @xmath45 will also heavily influence its dynamical behaviour far from stationarity .",
    "in particular , if we envisage starting at time @xmath222 in with an empty chain , since the growth of a domain requires the propagation of holes toward the left boundaries , the increasing suppression of this process in each sector @xmath80 implies that the convergence to the ness will be exponentially slow .",
    "this is the physical reason why our numerical calculation of the ness for @xmath45 is limited to @xmath41 .",
    "indeed effective suppression of the current sets in once a small domain , @xmath223 has formed  @xcite . as a result dephasing enhancement , identical to that seen here in the ness , equally applies to transient dynamical states where the domain has not yet saturated at @xmath84 .",
    "the analysis so far has focused on @xmath77 and @xmath45 . in this case",
    "we saw that numerous approximate dark states , whose occupation is favoured by @xmath45 boundary driving , cause the stationary state to become insulating .",
    "remaining in the strongly interacting limit we now wish to isolate the effects on the transport for all drivings @xmath6 , i.e. the current driving profile , due to the existence of such bound states .",

    "as @xmath261 such an exponential wave function is simply the discrete analogue of the well known bound state of a 1d @xmath262-potential .",

    "<S> _ introduction _ @xmath0 recently the effects of noise on the efficiency of quantum transport phenomena have been scrutinised intensely by the scientific community . </S>",
    "<S> this has been motivated in part by a series of ground - breaking nonlinear spectroscopic experiments on light - harvesting complexes demonstrating surprisingly long - lived quantum coherence during exciton transport , even in a warm and wet environment  @xcite . yet transport for purely coherent exciton dynamics in such protein pigment networks is highly suppressed due to destructive interference between different propagation pathways . </S>",
    "<S> instead studies revealed that the remarkably high transport efficiency observed ( above 95% ) in fact emerges in combination with local noise , such as dephasing , which disrupts this interference opening up previously inhibited pathways for transmission  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transport properties in such open systems thus not only defy the traditional understanding of when quantum effects should play a significant role , but also challenge the notion that couplings to the environment unconditionally degrade quantum phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> different effects of dephasing have been studied in networks populated by single particles , in scenarios such as transport through quantum optical systems @xcite , information transmission @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interplay between noise and strong correlations induced by interactions in a many - body setting is not yet fully understood . </S>",
    "<S> in particular a recent experiment  @xcite with cold - atoms exploring these effects during time - of - flight expansion raises an important question as to whether and how dephasing can enhance transport in an interacting system .    </S>",
    "<S> here we answer this question in the affirmative by considering a concrete example composed of spinless fermions with nearest - neighbour interactions hopping through a tight - binding chain , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this model makes an ideal testbed for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is equivalent to the well studied @xmath1 spin-@xmath2 chain  @xcite , representing one of the simplest models of strongly - correlated electron systems , and its physics is still not fully understood despite being bethe ansatz solvable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the transport properties of such low - dimensional interacting quantum systems remains an important open problem , exhibiting anomalous features such as ballistic spin transport and unusually high thermal conductivity , reported experimentally in so - called spin - chain materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to solid state systems like chains of coupled quantum dots  @xcite or molecular wires embedded between electrodes  @xcite , understanding this model is directly relevant to ion - trap  @xcite , coupled - cavity array  @xcite , and cold - atom  @xcite quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> of particular relevance are recent seminal experiments that revealed contact and bulk resistivity of cold fermionic atoms flowing within a narrow mesoscopic channel between a pair of reservoirs  @xcite .     across a chain , </S>",
    "<S> subject to a nearest - neighbour density - density interaction of strength @xmath3 , local dephasing at a rate @xmath4 , and boundary driving that injects / ejects fermions at a rate proportional to @xmath5 and driving bias @xmath6 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> very similar to this cold - atom experiment we consider a chain attached to two unequal markovian reservoirs at its boundaries providing continuous incoherent driving , along with local dephasing noise along its extension ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transport properties of the chain are then found by computing the current - driving characteristics of its non - equilibrium stationary state ( ness ) . </S>",
    "<S> being a one - dimensional and homogeneous chain , previously studied single - particle interference effects originating from geometry or disorder are absent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we show that dephasing - enhanced transport nonetheless emerges so long as the interactions are strong enough . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the ness forms a cooperative many - body quantum state with a long - ranged domain of particles pinned to one boundary strongly suppressing the current , analogous to a coulomb or pauli blockade insulator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even a small dephasing rate induces incoherent transitions between this bound state , preferentially occupied by the driving , and bands of mobile scattering states . </S>",
    "<S> this effect significantly enhances transport , most especially for regimes where the current is otherwise vanishingly small . </S>",
    "<S> we isolate the essential conditions for enhancement and demonstrate its generality beyond the integrable system considered . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the mechanism described helps explain recent experimental results with cold - atoms where the expansion of a strongly - interacting atomic gas was found to be slow in the absence of noise and substantially increased once noise was added  @xcite .    _ model _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 we study the interacting spinless fermion chain described by the hamiltonian ( taking @xmath7 throughout ) @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are standard fermionic creation / annihilation operators for site @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the associated number operator , and @xmath12 is the number of sites . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the tight - binding hopping terms , with amplitude @xmath13 , this hamiltonian has a nearest - neighbour density - density interaction @xmath14 which , depending on the sign of its strength @xmath3 , either penalizes ( @xmath15 ) or promotes ( @xmath16 ) the adjacency of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath17 to set the energy scale to which all other quantities are measured . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the system is described by a lindblad quantum master equation @xcite @xmath18 + \\mathcal{l}(\\rho),\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the density matrix of the chain , and @xmath20 is the dissipator describing the coupling to the markovian reservoirs . in lindblad form </S>",
    "<S> the dissipator can be expressed as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the anti - commutator and the sum is over a set of jump operators @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a dissipator that splits into three parts @xmath24 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe the coupling to external particle reservoirs at the left and right boundaries , respectively , each with two jump operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath5 is the coupling strength , identical for both reservoirs , and @xmath29 is the driving bias  @xcite . we consider moderate coupling @xmath30 throughout this paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the driving is to force the system far from equilibrium thereby giving a quantum analogue of the well studied classical exclusion stochastic model  @xcite . as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] it is composed of two processes : _ forward pumping _ creating particles at the left edge and removing them at the right , and _ backwards pumping _ doing the opposite . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath31 these processes have equal strength and so cancel exactly , resulting in the stationary solution @xmath32 to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ master_eq ] ) with no net current , irrespective of @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath33 the bias favours forward pumping raising the possibility of a ness possessing a finite current . the remaining contribution </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 accounts for bulk dephasing in the chain and is described by a jump operator @xmath35 for each site @xmath36 with a uniform dephasing rate @xmath4 .    by directly simulating eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ master_eq ] ) and taking the long time limit , the state @xmath37 converges to the time - independent ness of the system . </S>",
    "<S> a solution can be computed efficiently in a controlled way and accounting for significant many - body correlations by applying the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm @xcite to a matrix product operator description of @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this highly compact representation enables the efficient evaluation of relevant expectation values and makes accessible much larger system sizes than exact diagonalization or monte carlo approaches  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover tebd can be applied effectively over a large parameter range allowing us to examine the properties of the system as a function of @xmath6 beyond the @xmath38 linear response regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transport properties are found by computing the current crossing site @xmath10 from the operator @xmath39 . in the ness </S>",

    "<S> the dashed lines correspond to @xmath50 the non - interacting analytic result  @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> _ dephasing enhanced transport _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 it is known that in the weakly interacting regime @xmath51 , in the absence of dephasing , the system is an ideal ballistic conductor for any driving @xmath6 , with a nearly flat density @xmath43 and a current @xmath52 which is independent of @xmath12  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of dephasing has been shown to induce diffusive transport , where @xmath43 instead features a constant gradient and @xmath53 , characteristic of an ohmic conductor  @xcite . in either case </S>",
    "<S> the maximum current through the chain occurs at maximal bias @xmath45 , where only forward pumping is present , as might be intuitively expected . in the non - interacting limit @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> it has been proven rigorously that a homogeneous chain can not exhibit any dephasing enhanced transport @xcite ; this behaviour was also suggested for weakly - interacting systems where @xmath55  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) a complete picture of the latter result is presented . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for @xmath56 the reported current - driving profiles show that dephasing monotonically degrades the current for any driving , confirming that this behaviour persists even in the presence of weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the present work focuses on the strongly interacting regime @xmath57 .    in the absence of dephasing , and for weak driving @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> , transport was found  @xcite to be diffusive when @xmath58 , a controversial finding given that the integrability of the system was initially conjectured to lead to ballistic transport  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for strong driving @xmath59 it was discovered  @xcite that the ness exhibits a particle domain at the left edge of the chain , e.g. dominated by the configuration @xmath60 , irrespective of the sign of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suppresses the current as @xmath61 , characteristic of an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the current @xmath62 at @xmath63 exhibits non - linear behaviour with the driving @xmath6 , leading to an effect known as negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) where increasing the driving eventually decreases the current  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) the @xmath63 curve shows that this causes a near complete suppression at @xmath45 for @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in the strongly interacting regime the system presents the intriguing property that more current flows at an intermediate bias @xmath64 where some backward pumping is present .    </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this work is that for @xmath65 the presence of a small bulk dephasing can significantly enhance the current . </S>",
    "<S> this striking behaviour is illustrated for @xmath44 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) where dephasing up to a moderate rate @xmath66 is seen to increase the current . </S>",
    "<S> this elevation in the current is shown to occur _ for any _ @xmath33 , however , it is not uniform in @xmath6 resulting in the current - driving profile changing with @xmath4 . specifically , around @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> the ndc effect is lost and further increases in @xmath4 yield a linear profile in @xmath6 , resembling a diffusive conductor ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the most dramatic enhancement of the current occurs for strong driving biases @xmath68 , where the system changes from being insulating at @xmath63 to yielding the maximal current once @xmath69 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) this change at @xmath45 is shown to be coincident with the breakdown of the particle domain at the left boundary into a near linear density profile even for small dephasing rates . </S>",
    "<S> in this regime dephasing therefore induces not just quantitative increases in the current , but rather causes a major qualitative change in the behaviour of the system .    for a given @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> there is an optimal dephasing rate @xmath70 , beyond which the current is degraded by dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](d ) , where it is shown that both the maximum enhancement of the current and @xmath70 increase with @xmath6 . while for a weak driving @xmath71 the current enhancement at its @xmath70 is @xmath72 relative to @xmath63 , for @xmath45 the enhancement is @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath74 the current is reduced because the @xmath34 contribution to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ master_eq ] ) dominates over the coherent hopping terms and freezes out the dynamics by the zeno effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact for increasingly large dephasing rates the interaction becomes increasingly irrelevant , as demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](d ) by the convergence of the ness current to the exact @xmath75 solution with dephasing @xmath76 $ ]  @xcite .    _ enhancement mechanism _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 the origin of the dephasing enhanced transport in the strongly - interacting regime is intimately connected to the appearance of an insulating ness at @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this is most easily revealed by examining the very strongly - interacting limit @xmath77 with totally biased driving @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the numerical findings above , the ness in this extreme limit is insulating for two reasons : ( i ) when @xmath77 there exists an eigenstate @xmath78 of @xmath79 for each number sector @xmath80 , which is a bound state energetically separated from other eigenstates ; as @xmath81 it becomes exponentially close , with increasing @xmath12 , to being a dark state of @xmath45 driving ; ( ii ) the ergodic nature of the driving and coherent dynamics results in the unique ness being well approximated by a statistical mixture of @xmath82 , with the probability @xmath83 exponentially peaked at @xmath84 half - filled domain . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of an insulating ness thus arises due to an interplay between the nature of the boundary driving and the eigenstructure of the chain hamiltonian . in the supplementary material </S>",
    "<S> we show ( i ) and ( ii ) by examining the structure of the driving and coherent hybridisation of the @xmath80 particle boundary configuration @xmath85 that forms @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , bulk dephasing induces energy dissipation at a rate @xmath86 proportional to the kinetic energy of the state . as a result dephasing incoherently bridges the spectral gap between @xmath78 and mobile bands of scattering states , thereby dramatically enhancing the current as population escapes the dark state .     </S>",
    "<S> coupled coherently to their neighbours and with incoherent driving , via an auxiliary state @xmath87 , between states @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> crucially state @xmath89 is elevated in energy by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> see supplementary material for precise definitions of the model . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the current - driving profiles of the toy - model as a function of @xmath4 with @xmath42 and @xmath90 . ]    the effect outlined is captured concretely by a simple toy - model , depicted in fig .  [ fig3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model comprises of states @xmath91 , for some size @xmath92 , with coherent coupling between neighbouring states . </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath89 is elevated in energy by @xmath3 above the rest , analogous to the configuration @xmath93 ; the other states correspond to breakaway configurations like @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a mobile band of @xmath95 eigenstates and a single bound state of the form @xmath96 , irrespective of the sign of @xmath3 . via an auxiliary state @xmath87 , modelling another particle number sector , incoherent driving is included between states @xmath97 and @xmath89 with an identical @xmath6 dependence as the full system ( see supplementary material for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> dephasing is also introduced which scrambles the phase between @xmath89 and all other states . </S>",
    "<S> now since the amplitude for @xmath97 in @xmath98 scales as @xmath99 it is exponentially close to being a dark state of @xmath45 driving . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as @xmath45 driving pumps into the majority component @xmath89 of @xmath98 , it leads to an insulating ness at the extremal point @xmath45 and @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the current - driving profile is shown as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath4 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) , and is seen to reproduce both ndc and dephasing enhancement of the strongly - interacting regime of the full system . </S>",
    "<S> the toy - model thus reveals that this behaviour is entirely a consequence of the insulator at @xmath45 and @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it also shows that same physics underpins the ndc effect as dephasing enhancement . when @xmath45 and @xmath101 dephasing induces incoherent transitions to the mobile band . </S>",
    "<S> similarly for @xmath100 and @xmath64 the leading order effect of the weak backward pumping process @xmath102 , followed rapidly by the stronger forward pumping process @xmath103 , is to decohere @xmath98 .     and @xmath49 : ( a ) the half - chain entropy @xmath104 as a function of @xmath3 for different @xmath4 s , and ( b ) the optimal dephasing rate @xmath105 as a function of @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath50 indicates that dephasing acts only to degrade the current . </S>",
    "<S> however , numerical results presented in fig .  [ fig2](a ) already indicate that dephasing - degrading behaviour persists with weak interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that between the regimes @xmath117 and @xmath77 a cross - over in the response of the system to dephasing emerges . </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath118 is of particular significance since at zero - temperature it separates the equilibrium phases of the underlying spinless fermion hamiltonian , marking the opening of a gap above the ground state , and more generally divides a continuous eigen - spectrum for @xmath119 from one with numerous gaps for @xmath65  @xcite . in the driven system it was previously observed that @xmath120 also separates ballistic and diffusive transport regimes for weak driving  @xcite , however directly linking these equilibrium and non - equilibrium properties can be misleading  @xcite .    for @xmath100 </S>",
    "<S> , studies have attempted to identify the non - equilibrium regimes by examining two - point correlations , such as @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> the strongly - interacting regime was found to retain correlations extending over a fraction of the entire system as its size increases , while the weakly - interacting regime does not , with a sharp cross - over found at @xmath122  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we refine this signature by adopting a more general measure of correlations . specifically , we compute the entropy @xmath123 of the schmidt coefficients @xmath124 arising when the full ness density operator @xmath19 is factorized into two half - chains as @xmath125  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy @xmath104 quantifies both the quantum and classical correlations between the two halves of the chain and is readily accessible within the matrix product operator description used in tebd numerics . for zero dephasing fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) shows that @xmath104 features a peak at @xmath126 , indicating that a significant elevation in correlations occurs as the ness reorganises itself across the expected non - equilibrium phase transition between ballistic and diffusive transport there .    for finite dephasing the entropy @xmath104 monotonically decreases with @xmath4 , but interestingly , the peak is maintained for moderate rates shifting slightly to larger @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to @xmath127 this distinguishing feature in @xmath104 is progressively washed out as the system becomes diffusive for all @xmath3 with dephasing  @xcite ( see also supplementary material ) . despite this , dephasing in fact offers an alternative and clear signature of this underlying non - equilibrium phase transition . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) we show the optimal dephasing rate @xmath70 for weak driving as a function of @xmath3 , for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> a threshold of @xmath128 is apparent where for @xmath129 , @xmath130 , indicating dephasing - degrading transport , while for @xmath131 , @xmath105 is non - zero and increases monotonically with @xmath3 , indicating dephasing - enhanced transport . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath109 is size - dependent , and a scaling analysis shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig4](c ) demonstrates that , to good approximation , the isotropic point @xmath132 separates these regimes in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt on - set of dephasing enhancement therefore occurs when the many - body strong correlations are largest .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 we have presented a study of the effects of dephasing on the transport properties in a boundary driven one - dimensional interacting spinless fermion chain . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of a cooperative many - body ness exhibiting ndc provides a previously unexplored form of dephasing enhanced transport , distinct in origin from earlier examples in non - interacting systems . using a toy model we isolated the minimum requirements for observing ndc and dephasing enhanced transport in a strongly - interacting system . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is also unrelated to integrability @xcite , suggesting that our findings it will also apply in related , more realistic models of strongly - correlated electrons such as the @xmath133 or hubbard models , and in heat transport  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , tantalising signs of dephasing energy dissipation from bound states predicted here have already been observed in a recent cold - atom experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the prospects of verifying more directly both ndc and dephasing enhancement with cold - atoms seems promising  @xcite .    </S>",
