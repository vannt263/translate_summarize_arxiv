    "there are striking similarities between the projective group for the real or complex projective lines and the conformal group of the one - point completion of a real hilbert space of dimension at least 3 . in the first case ,",
    "the group consists of mbius maps of the form @xmath11 and in the second it is generated by linear isometries , homotheties and the inversion , corresponding to mbius transformations supplemented with a complex conjugation . in both cases",
    "one needs at least 4 points to define a group invariant quantity , i.e.  the cross - ratio . fixing a subset @xmath4 whose complement contains at least 2 points , the logarithm of cross - ratios",
    "may then be used to construct a ( semi-)metric on @xmath4 . on the interval @xmath12",
    ", there is a unique ( up to a constant ) distance invariant under mbius transformations preserving @xmath13 .",
    "this is precisely the restriction of the poincar metric @xmath14 on the unit disk in the complex plane . in the case of hilbert spaces of higher dimensions",
    "one may derive the so - called ` apollonian metric ' ( see below ) .",
    "this latter metric was first introduced for @xmath15 by barbilian @xcite and later rediscovered by beardon @xcite .    from a dynamical point of view",
    "it is of interest to know how a subset @xmath4 metrically embed into a larger subset @xmath16 with respect to the associated metrics @xmath3 and @xmath17 ( see below for more precise statements ) .",
    "it is straight - forward from definitions that the injection @xmath18 is non - expanding .",
    "more interesting , however , is that it verifies a very general uniform contraction principle ( ucp ) : if @xmath19 , i.e.   the embedding of @xmath4 has bounded diameter in the larger domain @xmath16 , then the injection is a strict contraction with a lipschitz constant bounded by @xmath20 .",
    "this is the same formula which appears in birkhoff s work on the hilbert metric @xcite .",
    "we give below the ( surprisingly simple ) proof of the ucp for the general case and in section [ sec applic ] some simple dynamical systems applications .",
    "there is no particular reasons for sticking to finite dimension , so in the following let @xmath1 be any real hilbert space .",
    "we write @xmath21 for the scalar product and @xmath22 for the norm on @xmath1 .",

    "the space @xmath28 is a complete metric space of diameter one with respect to the metric : @xmath29    given four points @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are disjoint we define their cross - ratio to be  : @xmath33 \\equiv   \\frac              { \\|x_2-u_1\\| \\ ; \\|x_1-u_2\\| }              { \\|x_1-u_1\\| \\ ; \\|x_2-u_2\\|}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath22 denotes the hilbert norm in @xmath1 and we adapt usual conventions for dealing with the point at @xmath24 . when @xmath2 is a proper subset ( by proper we mean that @xmath4 and @xmath34 are both non - empty ) one defines the apollonian ( semi , pseudo-)distance between points @xmath35 : @xmath36 \\in [ 0,+\\infty]\\ ] ]    we denote by @xmath37 the general conformal group which acts continuously upon @xmath28 and is generated by the set of isometries , homotheties ( both fixing @xmath24 ) and the inversion ( which exchanges the origin and @xmath24 ) : @xmath38 when @xmath39 the liouville theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) shows that any conformal map is in @xmath37 . in dimension 1 or 2 , it is the mbius group ( supplemented with complex conjugation in the 2 dimensional case ) .",
    "that @xmath3 is @xmath37 invariant is trivial for isometries and homotheties and in the case of inversions it follows easily from the formula @xmath40 ( with some care taken with respect to the point at infinity ) . from the cross - ratio identity @xmath41=[x , y;u , v ] \\ [ y , z;u , v]$ ] and taking sup in the right order one also sees that @xmath3 verifies the triangular inequality . when @xmath34 has non - empty interior @xmath3 is a genuine metric , but in the general case it need not distinguish points .",
    "we refer to e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) and @xcite for further details on the geometry of this metric .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ main theorem ] let @xmath42 be non - empty proper subsets with @xmath3 and @xmath17 being the associated apollonian metrics .",
    "let @xmath43 be the diameter of the smaller subset within the larger .",

    "+    proof : we will base our proof upon birkhoff s inequality @xcite for cross - ratios on the projective real line .",
    "it is , in fact , a special case of our main theorem when @xmath47 .",
    "we will use it in the following version : let @xmath48 be a non - empty open sub - interval of @xmath49 .",
    "the hilbert distance of @xmath50 relative to @xmath51 and @xmath52 are given by : @xmath53 \\right|   \\ \\ \\mbox{and } \\ \\",

    "birkhoff @xcite showed the fundamental inequality : @xmath55 proof of ( [ birkhoff ineq ] ) : it suffices to show this for @xmath56 and @xmath57 infinitesimally close .",
    "so we differentiate with respect to @xmath57 at @xmath58 and search for the optimal value of @xmath59 so that for every @xmath60 : @xmath61 , or equivalently @xmath62 the minimum value is at @xmath63 and equals @xmath64 which is therefore the desired contraction constant .",
    "now , returning to the general case let @xmath35 be distinct points .",
    "we have @xmath65 since the sup in the latter case is over a larger set .",

    "consider now the formula for the distance of @xmath72 relative to @xmath4 .",
    "it splits into a sum of two supremums ( this splitting is one of the deeper reasons why the apollonian metric is easy to handle ) : @xmath77 the suprema of these two terms are denoted @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
