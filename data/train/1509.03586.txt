    "stellar kinematic groups ( skgs ) superclusters ( scs ) and moving groups ( mgs) are kinematic coherent groups of stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( eggen 1994 ) ) that might share a common origin . among them ,",
    "the youngest skgs are : the hyades sc ( 600 myr ) , the ursa major mg ( sirius sc , 300 myr ) , the local association or pleiades mg ( 20 to 150 myr ) , the ic 2391 sc ( 35 - 55 myr ) , the castor mg ( 200 myr ) , and hercules - lyra ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* montes et al . , 2001 ) ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently other very young skgs ( tw hya , @xmath0 pic , tuc - hor , ab dor , columba and carina ) have been identified with kinematics close to the local association and others close to other mgs like argus to ic 2391 and octans , octans - near to castor ( see @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* torres et al .",
    "2008 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "even new associations are identified , such as the asya , all sky young association ( @xcite ) . in order to constrain the membership of kinematic candidate stars to these skgs additional information",
    "is needed .",
    "recently , several methods have been developed to take into account kinematics and photometry simultaneously : sacy survey ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* torres et al . 2008 ) ) , banyan survey ( @xcite ) , lacewing ( @xcite ) . using different age indicators such as the lithium line at 6707.8  , the chromospheric and coronal activity level , and gyrochronology , it is possible to quantify the contamination by younger or older field stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the detailed analysis of the chemical content ( _ chemical tagging _ ) is another powerful method that provides clear constraints on the membership to these structures ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "studies of open clusters such as the hyades and collinder 261 have found high levels of chemical homogeneity , showing that chemical information is preserved within the stars and that the possible effects of any external sources of pollution are negligible .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained at the 1.2  m mercator telescope at the _ observatorio del roque de los muchachos _ ( la palma , spain ) during several observing runs .",
    "fundamental stellar parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and [ fe / h ] ) are determined using an automatic code ( stepar ) which takes into account the sensitivity of iron @xmath4s measured in the spectra , see @xcite .",
    "chemical abundances were calculated using the equivalent width ( @xmath4 ) method in a fully differential way by comparing them with those derived for a solar spectrum .",
    "a total of 20 elements were analyzed : fe , the @xmath5-elements ( mg , si , ca , and ti ) , the fe - peak elements ( cr , mn , co , and ni ) , the odd - z elements ( na , al , sc , and v ) and the s - process elements ( cu , zn , y , zr , ba , ce and nd ) .",
    "we determined differential abundances @xmath6[x / h ] ( _ chemical tagging _ ) by comparing our measured abundances with those of a reference star known to be a member of the skg under study on a line - by - line basis .",

    "we found that 28 of the 61 stars analyzed have homogeneous abundances for all the elements we considered ( a 46% of the studied stars ) and are compatible with the hyades isochrone , as expected if they have evaporated from the hyades cluster .",

    "we have computed in an homogeneous way the fundamental stellar parameters and differential abundances of fgk candidate stars to different skgs that allowed us to apply the _ chemical tagging _ method and constrain their membership and quantify the contamination by younger or older field stars .",
    "we have already applied this method to the hyades sc , the ursa major and castor mgs , and we plan to apply it to additional spectroscopic observations of other younger skgs that will contribute to a better understanding of the star formation history in the solar neighborhood discerning between field population stars and real physical structures of coeval stars with a common origin .",
