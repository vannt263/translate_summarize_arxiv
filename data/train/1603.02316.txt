    "it is a famous result that a real brownian motion conditioned in doob s sense to remain positive , is distributed as a bessel @xmath0 process , i.e. as the radial process of a @xmath0-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "more generally , if one considers the adjoint action of a compact lie group on its lie algebra , the radial part process of a brownian motion in the lie algebra is distributed as a brownian motion in a cartan subalgebra conditioned to remain in a weyl chamber . in this paper , we consider the coadjoint action of a loop group of a compact group on the dual of the corresponding centrally extended loop algebra and prove that a brownian motion in a cartan subalgebra conditioned to remain in an affine weyl chamber - which can be seen as a space time conditioned brownian motion - is distributed as the radial part process of a brownian sheet on the underlying lie algebra .",

    "the lie algebra @xmath2 is equipped with an @xmath6-invariant scalar product , whose restriction to the cartan subalgebra is invariant for the action of the weyl group .",
    "if we consider the radial part process of a standard brownian motion on @xmath2 , it is a classical fact that this process is distributed as its projection on the cartan subalgebra @xmath3 - which is a brownian motion on @xmath3 - conditioned in doob s sense to remain forever in the weyl chamber .",
    "the kirillov s character formula is at the heart of the connection between the two processes .",
    "an affine lie algebra can be realized as a central extension of a loop algebra @xmath7 .",
    "considering the coadjoint action of the loop group @xmath8 on the dual of the centrally extended loop algebra , one defines the radial part of an element of this dual algebra ( see pressley and segal @xcite ) .",

    "its radial part provides a natural measure on the corresponding orbit under the action of @xmath8 .",
    "it highly suggested that one could construct a process on a loop algebra , whose the radial part process would be distributed as a projection on a cartan subalgebra , conditioned to remain in an affine weyl chamber .",
    "the affine weyl chamber is a fundamental domain for the action of the weyl group on the tits cone .",
    "the first difficulty is that there is no euclidean structure on the cartan subalgebra of an affine lie algebra , which would be invariant for the action the weyl group .",
    "so there is no natural brownian motion to consider on it .",
    "the kirillov s orbit method , on which we based our intuition , suggests a connection between coadjoint orbits for the action of a loop group on the dual of an affine lie algebra and irreducible representations of the affine lie algebra .",
    "tensor product of irreducible representations of an affine lie algebra makes appear a drift in the direction of the fundamental weight @xmath9 .",
    "the idea is to consider a process with such a drift in the direction of @xmath9 - which can be seen as a time component - living in an affine lie algebra . in this paper",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ action orbits ]",
    "we describe the orbits for the coadjoint action of a loop group of a compact group on the dual of the associated centrally extended loop algebra .",
