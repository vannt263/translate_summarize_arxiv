    "one of the ultimate goals in unstable homotopy is to understand how the loops - over - suspension functor @xmath2 changes the homotopy type of the space .",
    "one aspect of such understanding is the computation and investigation of the homotopy groups of loop spaces and one of the most powerful methods for it is an unstable adams spectral sequence first introduced in @xcite .",
    "construction of this spectral sequence starts with a free simplicial group model for a loop space , equipped with a lower @xmath1-central series filtration , which produces the spectral sequence itself .",
    "so framework for this machinery is a category of ( pointed ) simplicial sets @xmath0 .",
    "computations show that for a loop space over spheres , @xmath1-locally unstable adams spectral sequence is accelerated in a sense that non - trivial elements on its first page are concentrated in columns with numbers @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another approach to investigating loop - suspension functor @xmath4 through functorial direct product decompositions was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it uses significantly a certain model for @xmath5 in @xmath6 - james construction @xmath7 - a reduced free monoid on points of @xmath8 together with a word - length filtration @xmath9 on it . among all ( @xmath1-local ) decompositions of the form @xmath10 there is a minimal one , called @xmath11 in a sense that it is obtained from a minimal coalgebra retract of a tensor algebra functor @xmath12 - which is homological representation of an @xmath2 .",
    "it can be shown that primitive elements of such minimal coalgebra retract are concentrated in the degrees @xmath3 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to translate the above mentioned decompositions to a category of simplicial sets and furthermore to extend them to a level of spectral sequences . from this point of view",
    "primitive elements of @xmath11 form a first page of a functorial sub - spectral sequence of unstable adams spectral sequence for suspensions and therefore result about acceleration of spectral sequence for @xmath13 becomes a particular case ( since @xmath14 ) of a more general situation .",
    "we will briefly recall the idea of the loop - suspensions decompositions as in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be a ground field , then by bott - samelson theorem homology of @xmath5 with coefficients in @xmath16 is given by the tensor algebra @xmath17 on the reduced homology on @xmath8 , i.e. functorially there is a map @xmath18\\xrightarrow{h_*}{\\mathrm{hom}}_{\\mathrm{coalg}}(t , t)\\ ] ] by geometric realization theorem in @xcite this map is surjective , and in fact all natural coalgebra maps @xmath19 can be realized as an elements in a certain subgroup of @xmath20 $ ] called cohen group @xmath21 first introduced in @xcite . now given any coalgebra idempotent @xmath19 it can be lifted to a space level to obtain a map @xmath22 and @xmath23 will give a first piece of decomposition ( [ classicaldecomposition ] ) , second piece is given similarly by a homotopy mapping telescope of a complement map @xmath24\\varphi^{-1}$ ] .    to adapt this picture to @xmath0 ,",

    "unfortunately , heaviness construction of @xmath27 adjunction hides combinatorial nature of @xmath21 , so preservation of lower @xmath1-central series by its elements looks untraceable under this approach .",
    "instead we will define generators of cohen group as a certain natural transformations of functors on pointed sets and will extend this definition to a @xmath0 level - wisely .",
    "the main object of interest here is milnor s construction @xmath28 $ ] - simplicial group model for a loop - suspension functor @xmath2 .",
    "our first goal is to extend the combinatorial james - hopf map from free monoid to a free group framework .",
    "it is achieved by translating hilton - hopf map to simplicial level and applying hall s commutator collection process inside simplicial version of hilton - milnor s theorem .",
    "the resulting definition ( [ newjh ] ) have all desired properties of a classical james - hopf map and moreover can be considered as a non - abelian version of magnus embedding @xcite .",
    "since everything happens level - wisely , whitehead product can be considered just as iterated commutator map , permutations and iterated reduced diagonal maps stays the same as in ( [ classicalgenerators ] ) .",
    "with help of fox differential calculus it will be shown that elements of cohen group preserve lower central series on free simplicial group @xmath28 $ ] and therefore induce a map between lower ( @xmath1-)central towers of fibrations .",
    "extending these maps to an exact couple level will equip unstable adams spectral sequence with an action of cohen group .",
    "such action used to obtain a functorial decomposition of this spectral sequence in a following way .",
    "as before , one starts with a functorial coalgebra idempotent @xmath19 , which is now extended to a natural self - transformation of functor @xmath29):{\\mathrm{sset}_*}\\to\\mathrm{scoalg}_{{\\mathbf{k}}}$ ] . by simplicial realization theorem ( [ simplicialrealizationtheorem ] ) this natural transformation",
    "can be lifted to a self - map of l.c.s .",
    "tower and each level of the corresponding tower can be decomposed through a mapping telescope construction in a usual way .",
    "such decomposition preserves the fibrations inside the l.c.s .",
    "tower , which can be therefore presented as a direct product of two towers , with layers weak equivalent to primitive elements of coalgebra retracts of @xmath29)$ ] , corresponded to idempotent @xmath30 and its complement ( theorem ( [ towerdecomposition ] ) .",
    "choosing an idempotent which corresponds to a minimal coalgebra retract ( @xmath11 subfunctor of @xmath12 ) will produce a direct summand of l.c.s .",
    "tower with non - trivial layers only at degrees @xmath3 . therefore corresponding spectral sequence will be accelerated in the same sense as in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
