    "it is easy to check on a diagram that @xmath153 is the tangent of @xmath150 , while @xmath154 is the tangent of @xmath146 .",
    "it follows that : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the interior angle of @xmath34 at @xmath147 , i.e. , @xmath157 .",
    "note that @xmath158 and that @xmath159 , it follows that @xmath160 and the expression given in the lemma follows because @xmath161 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ tm : elementary ] is a direct consequence of lemma [ lm : expression ] since , under the hypothesis of the theorem , all terms involved in the sum are non - negative ( and some of them are strictly positive ) .",
    "the arguments in the previous section suggest a way to transform question [ q : main ] in a way which makes it much less elementary but perhaps more precise in a fairly technical manner . for a general decomposable polyhedron @xmath5 , along with a decomposition as a union of simplices with disjoint interior ( and with no vertex beyond those of @xmath5 )",
    "it is still possible to define an invariant generalizing the number @xmath128 defined above for suspensions .",
    "however in this more general case @xmath125 is a @xmath162 matrix , where @xmath163 is the number of `` interior '' edges in the simplicial decomposition of @xmath5 .    after defining @xmath125",
    ", we will show here that it is a symmetric matrix , and that @xmath5 is infinitesimally rigid if and only if @xmath125 is non - singular .",
    "in addition , the content of the previous section shows that , under some mild assumptions , its diagonal has positive entries .",
    "this suggests that @xmath125 might be positive definite whenever @xmath5 is weakly convex ; this would at least imply a positive answer to question [ q : main ] .      in this section",
    "we consider a polyhedron @xmath5 , along with a simplicial decomposition of @xmath5 with no vertex except the vertices of @xmath5 .",
    "we call @xmath164 the simplices in the decomposition of @xmath5 , and @xmath165 the interior edges of the decomposition , i.e. , the segments which are edges of the simplicial decomposition but are contained in the interior of @xmath5 .",
    "clearly any isometric first - order deformation of @xmath5 is uniquely determined by the first - order variation of the lengths of the @xmath166 , because the other edges of the simplicial decomposition have fixed length .",
    "let @xmath167 be the set of lengths @xmath168 so that , for each of the simplices @xmath130 , if the lengths of the edges of @xmath130 which are in the interior of @xmath5 are fixed at the values determined by the @xmath169 and the length of the other edges are equal to their length in @xmath5 , the resulting 6 numbers are indeed the lengths of the edges of an euclidean simplex .      to each choice of @xmath172",
    "we can associate an euclidean structure on the simplicial decomposition of @xmath5 used here , but with cone singularities at the edges @xmath166 .",
    "so to each interior edge @xmath166 is attached a number , the sum of the angles at @xmath166 of the simplices containing it ( or in other terms the angle around the cone singularity corresponding to @xmath166 ) , which we call @xmath133 .",
    "this defines a map : @xmath173                suppose first that @xmath5 is not infinitesimally rigid , and consider a first - order edge - length preserving deformation .",
    "let @xmath179 be the corresponding first - order variations of the lengths of the interior edges of the simplicial decomposition .",
    "under the same deformation , the sum of the angles at each interior edge @xmath166 remains equal to @xmath134 ( at first order ) so that @xmath180 , and this shows that @xmath125 is singular .",
    "suppose conversely that @xmath125 is singular , and let @xmath181 be a non - zero element in the kernel of @xmath125 .",
    "it defines a first - order variation of the euclidean metric on each of the simplices appearing in the decomposition of @xmath5 , and therefore of the euclidean structure , with singularities at the edges , naturally defined on this simplicial complex .",
    "however the first - order variation under @xmath181 of the angle at each of the interior edges vanishes precisely because @xmath181 is in the kernel of @xmath125 .",
    "this means that the euclidean structure remains associated to an euclidean polyhedron , and therefore that @xmath5 is not infinitesimally rigid .",
    "this is another simple property of @xmath125 . to prove it we need some additional notation .",
    "we call @xmath182 the edges of the simplicial decomposition which are contained in the boundary of @xmath5  i.e. , those which are not among the @xmath166  and @xmath183 their lengths . for each simplex @xmath130 and each edge @xmath184 ( resp",

    "@xmath187 ) the angle of @xmath130 at @xmath184 ( resp . at @xmath185 ) .",
    "we then introduce the sum of the `` mean curvatures '' of the simplices : @xmath188 where the first sum is over all simplices @xmath130 and edges @xmath184 such that @xmath184 is an edge of @xmath130 , while the second sum is the corresponding quantity with @xmath185 instead of @xmath184 . then , under a first - order deformation : @xmath189 now we consider @xmath190 as a function over @xmath171 , which means that we fix the values of the @xmath191 , the lengths of the edges of the simplicial decomposition of @xmath5 which are on the boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "the formula for the first - order variation of @xmath190 simplifies and becomes : @xmath192 but the celebrated schlfli formula states that @xmath193 so that @xmath194 this means that @xmath125 , as defined above , is the hessian matrix of @xmath190 , considered as a function of the @xmath169 ( which are coordinates on @xmath171 ) .",
