    "one of the fascinating effects of magnetic fields on the electron transport properties in bulk materials is the well - known shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect , i.e. , magnetoconductivity ( mc ) or magnetoresistance ( mr ) of the system is independent of the magnetic field strength at very low magnetic field , and exhibits an oscillating dependence with the magnetic field strength  at higher magnetic fields.@xcite this phenomena arises from the interplay between the quantized landau levels and the fermi energy . in semiconductor superlattices the sdh effect displays a rich diversity of prominent phenomena since the electron motion along the magnetic field is quite different from that in bulk materials .",
    "the conductivity of a system is determined by the number of different states near the fermi energy , the group velocity associated with them , and the coupling of these states to each other by scattering mechanisms .",

    "finally , the conclusion is presented in sec .",
    "we model a dms superlattice as a periodic array of square potential wells and non magnetic barriers and assume that the magnetic ions are distributed homogeneously in the dms layers ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in ordinary semiconductor superlattices ,",
    "the zeeman splitting is quite small due to the small land @xmath9 factor . in a dms superlattice ,",
    "a small external magnetic field gives rise to a giant zeeman splitting of the conduction band states , and results in striking differences between spin - up and spin - down  electron states of the system .",
    "this giant zeeman splitting arises from the spins of the injected electrons interacting with the @xmath10 spins of the localized @xmath11 electrons of the mn@xmath12 ions via the _ s - d _ exchange interaction@xcite .",
    "our theory is based on the assumption that the electron motion in the dms superlattice can be well described by the effective mass approximation ( ema ) which are confirmed by recent experiments@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the model hamiltonian for electrons in such a system is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the periodic potential along the growth direction , @xmath15 is the period of the dms  superlattice , and @xmath16 is the spin of the localized @xmath17 electrons of the mn ions with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the electron spin .",
    "we assume that the magnetic ions are distributed homogeneously in the dms layers .",
    "the extended nature of the electronic wave function spanning a large number of magnetic ions and lattice sites allows the use of the molecular - field approximation to replace the magnetic - ion spin operator @xmath20 with its thermal and spatial average @xmath21 , taken over all the ions .",
    "the mean spin @xmath21 denotes the spatial as well as the thermal average of the spin component along the magnetic field .",
    "this approach has been proven to be valid in previous theoretical works on magneto - optical property of dms material .",
    "very recently , this approximation was applied sucessfully to study the transport property of dms  system.@xcite the exchange interaction given by eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) can , in the molecular - field approximation , be written in terms of a zeeman - like hamiltonian @xmath22 where@xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the brillouin function , @xmath26 is the number of cations per unit volume , the phenomenological parameters @xmath27 ( reduced effective concentration of mn ) and @xmath28 accounts for the reduced single - ion contribution due to the antiferromagnetic mn - mn coupling , @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath30 is the electron spin .",
    "the parameters used in the calculation are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the dms material , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . in eq .",
    "( [ meanfield ] ) the exchange interaction @xmath37 only induces spin - conserving processes , and consequently we neglected all spin - flip processes .    using the usual boundary conditions@xcite for the electron wavefunction at the well / barrier interface ,",
    "the energy eigenvalue can be obtained by solving the following equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 @xmath42 is the depth or the height of the dms  layer which depends on the spin orientation(@xmath43 , @xmath44for the spin - up electron , @xmath45for the spin - down electron ) .",
    "the period of the superlattice is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the width of the dms layers and @xmath48 is the width of the nonmagnetic semiconductor layers . @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the effective mass of the electron in the dms layers and nonmagnetic semiconductor layers , respectively . in this work the difference between the effective mass of the electron in the dms  layers and the non dms  layers is neglected which is a reasonable assumption because of the low mn concentration ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "notice that the barrier height and the well depth can be tuned by varying the external magnetic field .    in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the in - plane motion of the electron is described by discrete landau levels on which any effect of the collision broadening is ignored .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalue of the electron state in a dms  superlattice under a perpendicular magnetic field is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the complete set of quantum indices , @xmath54 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath55 denotes the label for the landau level .",
    "@xmath56 is the energy spectrum of the miniband in the dms  superlattice .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the linear - response regime , assume weak electric field , and ignore spin - flipping processes , therefore the distribution function can be written in the form of @xmath73 , here @xmath74 is the equilibrium distribution function and @xmath75 is the linear term which is proportional to the electric field . because there is no electric current in the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution , the current density eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) becomes    @xmath76    from this formula , we can find that the current density is ascribes to the contribution of the landau level near the fermi energy , and especially at low - temperature @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the conductivity @xmath79 can be obtained as @xmath80    the degree of spin polarization of the current density under weak electric field can be defined as @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the component of spin - up ( spin - down ) current density .",
    "figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) show the energy spectrum of the lowest two miniband spin - up ( solid curves ) and spin - down ( dashed curves ) electron states ( see eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , @xmath83 ) for a znse / zn@xmath3mn@xmath4se diluted magnetic  semiconductor superlattice for different magnetic fields . from these figures",
    "we notice that the separation between the spin - up and spin - down electron is enhanced significantly with increasing magnetic field .",
    "notice that the fermi energy is located slightly above the bottom of the second miniband at low magnetic fields ( see fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) . in strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the energy of the lowest spin - up miniband is even higher than that of the spin - down second miniband , and only the lowest spin - down miniband is occupied by electrons ( see fig .",
    "2 ( b ) ) .",
    "this can be explained as follows , an external magnetic field induces a magnetization of the magnetic ion mn@xmath12 along the direction of the magnetic field in the dms superlattice . from eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , the magnetic ions can influence the energy of the electron state via the _ s - d _ exchange interaction , and leads to a giant spin splitting which is comparable to the band offset between znse and zn@xmath3mn@xmath4se .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) depict how the bandwidths of the electrons for different spin orientation vary with the magnetic field . for spin - down electrons",
    "the bandwidth decreases and saturates with increasing magnetic field , but for spin - up electrons , it exhibits a maximum and saturates when the magnetic field increases . for spin - up electrons",
    "the wells become more and more shallow and finally form barriers with increasing magnetic field . at this point",
    "the band widths diverge and the miniband gaps disappear ( see fig .",
    "therefore the band width for the spin - up electron exhibits a local maximum . in fig .",
    "2(e ) we plot the group velocity of the electrons with different spin orientation as a function of the momentum @xmath84 for different magnetic fields . at low fields the group velocity for",
    "the spin - up electron is larger than that in the absense of magnetic field . the group velocity for the spin - up and spin - down electrons decrease at strong magnetic fields .",
    "figure 3 shows the landau level fan diagram for spin - down ( thick curves ) and spin - up ( thin curves ) electrons in a dms superlattice under a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines indicate the energy of the landau level at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , i.e. the edge of the lowest miniband .",
    "notice that the magnetic field variation of the landau levels in dms is quite different from that in a nonmagnetic semiconductor , which is linearly proportional to the external magnetic field . in a dms  superlattice the landau levels exhibit minima with increasing magnetic field , and",
    "its variation with magnetic field is quite different from that of the landau levels for the spin - up electron .",
    "for very small magnetic fields the _ s - d _ exchange interaction increases the barrier height for the spin - up electrons moving the landau levels up in energy , while for the spin - down electrons the wells deepen resulting in a decrease of the landau level energy .",
    "this effect saturates around @xmath87 when the magnetization of the mn@xmath12 is saturated beyond which we have the usual landau level fan diagram for each of the electron spin states .",
    "the spin - up and spin - down fan are shifted in energy due to the fact that they move in a different superlattice potential .",
    "the thickest solid curve in fig .  3 denotes the fermi energy vs the magnetic field .",
    "sharp drops take place at the points where the fermi energy passes through the bottom of the different landau level bands . from this figure",
    "we also learn that the electron state becomes spin - polarized since only the lowest spin - down miniband is populated at sufficient large fields .",
    "figure 4 shows the conductivity @xmath79 as a function of magnetic field for various temperatures in a dms superlattice . the inset shows the fermi energy vs magnetic field in such a system .",
    "an interesting property of the mc is the variation of the low - field mc",
    ". the conductivity decreases and oscillates with increasing magnetic field . at low magnetic field ,",
    "the spin splitting induced by the _ s - d _ exchange interaction is even much larger than the separation of the landau levels , the _ s - d _ exchange interaction results in a variation of the miniband width , i.e. a variation of the electron group velocity ( see eq .",
    "( [ v_g ] ) ) . from fig .",
    "1(c ) we find that an increase of the magnetic field leads to a decrease of the bandwidth for the spin - down and the spin - up electron and a local maximum for the spin - up electron , i.e. a decrease of the group velocity for the spin - down and spin - up electron and a local maximum for the spin - up electron ( see fig .",
    "therefore , the mc exhibits a maximum for the spin - up electron and a decrease for the spin - down electron in the low - field case ( see fig .",
    "the decrease of the low - field mc was found previously in disordered 2d system which was attributed to quantum corrections caused by anderson weak localization @xcite .",
    "but the decrease of mc in a dms  superlattice arises from the _ s - d _ exchange interaction between the intinerant electron and the localized magnetic impurity which lifts the degeneracy of the spin - up and spin - down electron band states .",
    "the magnetization of the magnetic ions mn@xmath12 saturates with increasing magnetic field , therefore the strength of the exchange interaction ( the last term in eq .",
    "( [ meanfield ] ) ) also saturates when the magnetic field becomes strong enough ( b4 t ) .",
    "the separation of the landau levels increases linearly ( see fig .",
    "3 ) with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the fermi surface passes through the band bottom of the subsequent landau levels with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the fermi energy ( see the inset ) decreases and shows a series of sharp drops at strong magnetic field .",
    "the variation of mc in strong magnetic field is ascribed to the contribution from landau levels near the fermi energy .",
    "when a landau level passes through the fermi surface , the electron group velocity of the states which contribute to conduction drops to zero ( see eq .",
    "( [ conduc ] ) ) resulting in an oscillation of the mc .",
    "the conductivity exhibits a sharp dip if there is only one landau level near the fermi energy .",
    "the separation of the landau levels is small at low field and these dips are smeared out since there are many landau levels located near the fermi surface . from this figure , we can also see that the dips will be less pronounced when temperature increases since the latter leads to a smearing of the fermi surface .",
    "figure 5 depicts how the conductivity @xmath79 varies with magnetic field for different carrier density .",
    "the period of the conductivity oscillations for lower density is larger than that for higher density , which can be understood from the inset which shows the variation of the fermi energy versus magnetic field .",
    "when the landau level passes through the fermi surface , a corresponding dip can be found in the conductivity . since the period of the oscillation of the fermi energy for lower density is also larger than that for higher density , the period of the mc oscillation for lower density will be larger than for higher density .    in fig .",
    "6 we plot the spin polarization of the current versus the magnetic field for different temperatures .",
    "the inset shows the spin - up and spin - down components of mc .",
    "the spin - up components exhibit a maximum for small magnetic field and decreases rapidly to zero , since the population for the spin - up band decreases when the magnetic field increases .",
    "the maximum is due to a maximum in the bandwidth ( see fig .",
    "2(c ) ) . from this inset we found that the oscillation in the mc  is due to the spin - down mc components . the spin polarization at higher temperature increases more slowly than that at low temperature due to the thermal fluctuations of the magnetization of the magnetic ions .",
    "we studied the electron transport in dms  superlattices using a semiclassical boltzman equation , and investigated the effect of the s - d exchange interaction which is treated using the molecular - field approximation on the longitudinal spin transport in diluted magnetic semiconductor superlattices .",
    "the conductivity exhibits an oscillating behavior with varying magnetic field .",
    "the conductivity decreases rapidly for small magnetic field , and increases for strong magnetic field .",
    "the dips in the conductivity at strong magnetic fields are smeared out with increasing temperature .",
    "the spin polarization increases rapidly with increasing magnetic field and the longitudinal mc becomes spin - polarized in strong magnetic fields .",
    "our results clearly illustrate that one can adjust the longitudinal spin transport by tuning the external magnetic field in dmssuperlattices .",
    "most optical and transport properties of the band electrons in dms were successfully interpreted within the molecular - field approxiamtion .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that this approach is only justified for pure paramagnetic material where the every spin can be treated independently . in paramagnetic dms system",
    "the s - d exchange interaction induced spin splitting is relevant for small barrier height , the spin - orbit interaction and band - structure related spin - flip processes are not very efficient.@xcite therefore in our calculation we ignored the effect of the magnetization fluctuations which may be important at low magnetic fields which is expected to increase the overall resistance and decrease the spin polarization at low fields .",
    "these magnetic fluctuations are supressed in a strong magnetic field ( b1 t ) .",
    "nevertheless , the previous investigations show that the theoretical results based on the molecular - field approximation give the correct positions for the maxima and minima of the mc in dms  systems@xcite in strong magnetic fields since the magnetization fluctuations are supressed , and therefore we believe that the qualitative behavior of our mc is correct especially in strong magnetic fields ( b1 t ) . in summary ,",
    "the external magnetic field is a tool to tailor the transport properties of dms  superlattices .",
    "such systems are extremely attractive from the point of view of both basic research and technological application , such as for a spin filter .",
