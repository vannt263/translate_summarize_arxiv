    "one suggests a certain effective lagrangian defined on the world volume , which was the target space in the worldsheet formulation @xcite .",
    "this candidate is validated by comparing the s - matrix elements it produces to those obtained from the worldsheet procedure .",
    "this straightforward procedure does not address various questions such as the uniqueness of the effective lagrangian and its worldvolume and topology .",

    "this is the case of topological theories of matter .",
    "topological field theories ( tfts ) provide a simple framework to study open / closed duality properties of string theory .",
    "one class of tfts are the topological @xmath6-models @xcite . in order to construct these models",
    "we start with a @xmath7 supersymmetric non - linear @xmath6-model in two - dimensions .",
    "this is a theory of maps @xmath8 from a two - dimensional worldsheet @xmath9 to a target space @xmath10 , which is a kahler manifold .",

    "the first leads to the topological a - model , while the second to the topological b - model @xcite . due to the axial anomaly",
    ", the b - model is well defined only when the target space is a calabi - yau manifold .",

    "( the earliest study we are aware of is @xcite . )    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will begin in section 2 by reviewing the elementary tft correlation functions of the model , following @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we present our solution of the model at higher worldsheet topologies . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the duality properties of our results . in section 5",
    "we couple the @xmath19 model to topological gravity and present a few steps towards a complete study of the model . in particular , we obtain the constitutive relations of the disk amplitude on the large ( closed string ) phase space . section 6 is devoted to a discussion .",
    "part of the results on matter tfts in this paper have been presented in @xcite .",
    "we will denote by @xmath20 the correlation function of the operators @xmath21 on a riemann surface with genus @xmath0 and @xmath1 boundaries . in this section",
    "we will outline the computational scheme that we will use in order to calculate these correlation functions .",
    "consider first the correlators on the sphere with no boundaries .",
    "there are two operators of the topological @xmath19 @xmath6-model , the identity operator , @xmath22 , and the operator corresponding to the second cohomology class of the sphere , which we shall denote by @xmath23 .",
    "it is represented by a @xmath24-function two - form on @xmath25 . on the worldsheet",
    "@xmath23 is a zero - form .",
    "we have @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 comes from the classical action of the @xmath19 @xmath6-model and is the contribution of one - instanton , i.e. a degree one holomorphic map from the worldsheet to the @xmath19 target space .",
    "the one - point correlator of @xmath23 is constant since it gets contribution only from the constant map : we map the worldsheet two - sphere to the target space two - sphere with the point where @xmath23 is inserted on the worldsheet being mapped to a given point in the target space .",
    "the three - point correlator of @xmath23 gets contribution from a degree one holomorphic map : we map the three insertion points to three given points on the target space . from ,",
    "one derives the non - trivial ring relation ( ope ) @xmath28      we now want to consider the @xmath19 model with branes included in the background . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "there are two possible branes that preserve topological invariance .",

    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath31 here , it is understood that @xmath30 will be inserted on the boundary , while @xmath23 is inserted in the bulk of the disc .",
    "the one - point correlator of @xmath30 on the disk is constant since it receives contribution only from the constant map : we map the disk worldsheet to the target space @xmath32 , such that the boundary of the disk is mapped to the equator and the insertion point on the boundary of the disk is mapped to a given point on the equator .",
    "this holomorphic map is the constant map .",
    "the three - point correlator of @xmath30 receives contribution from the disk one - instanton ( or half - instanton in the closed string sense ) , which is a degree one map from the disk to @xmath32 , where the boundary of the disk is mapped to the equator .",

    "it is also important to note that there are no boundary condition changing operators between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .      we assign axial r - charges to the operators r[h ] = 2 ,",
    "r[e ] = 1  . in general",
    ", an amplitude @xmath39 will be proportional to @xmath40 if @xmath41 is an integer ( without boundaries ) or half - integer ( with boundaries ) satisfying @xmath42 if there is no such @xmath41 the amplitude vanishes .    note",
    "that a @xmath43 amplitude will vanish if both boundary conditions appear at the boundaries of the surface .",
    "this is because there are no boundary condition changing operators .",
    "therefore , we will choose @xmath44 equal for all boundaries and fix it .",
    "moreover , the amplitude will vanish unless @xmath30 is inserted an odd number of times on each boundary .",
    "an important idea of @xcite , picked up in @xcite , is that the tft correlation functions on riemann surfaces of higher genus can be computed as correlation functions on the sphere with some additional insertions .",
    "this idea can be straightforwardly generalized to the present situation with boundaries .",
    "thus , we introduce a handle operator @xmath45 , with defining property .",
    "@xmath46 , it relates correlators on surfaces of different topology .",
    "one can compute @xmath45 at @xmath47 by degenerating the torus into a sphere . here , the relations @xmath48 imply @xmath49    when considering surfaces with boundaries , we have to fix boundary conditions @xmath50 on each of them .",
    "moreover , we have to allow for a dependence of the boundary state on the boundary insertions .",
    "we will then label the boundary states as @xmath51 to indicate dependence on the boundary condition and the boundary insertion .",
    "it satisfies @xmath52 it should be understood that the operator @xmath53 is inserted on the @xmath54-th boundary on the left and on the right hand side of the equation .",
    "the boundary states can be computed on the disc .",
    "from , we learn @xmath55      field theories can be axiomatized by the algebra structure provided by their operators . for a tft on closed riemann surfaces ,",
    "the relevant structure is that of a frobenius algebra ( we consider the quantum algebra deformed by the worldsheet instantons ) . for the @xmath19 model",
    ", the frobenius algebra has a basis of idempotents , which are given by @xmath56 and satisfy the algebra @xmath57 the trace on the algebra is given by @xmath58 the handle operator is @xmath59    abstractly , branes should correspond to modules over the algebra of bulk operators , in other words , to ( irreducible ) representations of this algebra .",
    "indeed , using , we learn that , in presence of the boundary @xmath44 , @xmath60 which are indeed the possible representations of .",
    "note also that @xmath61",
    "in this section we will compute the exact correlation functions of the @xmath19 model . here , by `` exact '' , we mean that we will sum over worldsheet topologies , but without coupling to topological gravity .",
    "we weight a closed riemann surface of genus @xmath0 by a factor @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the closed string coupling .",
    "without boundaries we have @xcite @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the idempotent basis , this can be written as @xmath66 this result is seemingly invariant under @xcite @xmath67    note , however , that according to , @xmath68 and the transformations are not mutually compatible .",
    "thus , only correlators of one type , say @xmath69 are invariant and , in particular , @xmath70 is not invariant as can be easily checked .",
    "one can , however , deform the theory as to make it completely invariant . on general grounds ,",
    "one expects the theory to depend on as many parameters as there are operators in the theory .",
    "as explained in @xcite , these parameters are most easily encoded in the sphere one - point functions of the basis of idempotents , while keeping fixed the rest of the ope . in our case , we write @xmath71 and we may in general treat @xmath72 as independent from @xmath73 .",
    "we recover the standard @xmath19 model on the subspace @xmath74 .",
    "note that this deformation may or may not be realized in the standard brst procedure , and may not survive coupling to topological gravity .    now repeating the above computation we have @xmath75 since",
    "now @xmath73 and @xmath72 are independent parameters , we have an exact symmetry of the theory generated by    @xmath76    note that although we seem to have introduced three parameters @xmath77 , the correlation functions on closed riemann surfaces depend only on two parameters , which are the combinations @xmath78 .      as a warmup for higher genus computations with background d - branes ,",
    "let us check the factorization properties of the annulus correlator ( see fig .",
    "[ factor ] ) .",
    "we put equal boundary conditions on the two boundaries .",
    "there are then three amplitudes to consider : @xmath22 inserted on both boundaries , @xmath22 on one , @xmath30 on the other boundary , or @xmath30 on both boundaries .",
    "+   +    factorizing via boundary states ( middle of fig .",
    "[ factor ] ) , we find @xmath79    we can also factorize as in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ factor ] .",
    "@xmath80 where @xmath81 is a sign that appears to be not so well understood in the general axiomatics of open - closed tft ( see , , @xcite ) . to be consistent , we here need this sign to be @xmath82",
    ". the second correlator @xmath83 does not suffer from this ambiguity and is consistent with in any case .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath84 requires @xmath85 , in which case , using , we obtain agreement with . we conclude that the relative sign between the two terms in the last line of fig.[factor ] depends on the boundary insertions .",
    "we now turn to a computation of exact correlation functions in the presence of background d - branes . in order to carry out this computation",
    ", we have to supply the combinatorial factors involved in summing over boundaries , and in distributing boundary insertions over the various boundaries .",
    "to remain flexible , we introduce an open string coupling constant @xmath86 and weigh a worldsheet of topology @xmath43 by @xmath87 .",
    "our aim is to evaluate @xmath88 where we use @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and we assume that all the boundaries carry label @xmath44 .",
    "( as mentioned before , the amplitudes otherwise vanish . )",
    "note that to proceed with we have to know how the boundary insertions are distributed on the various boundaries .",
    "this is not specified in , which involves a sum over all possible numbers of boundaries .",
    "thus , there is an ambiguity that will accompany us for the next few pages . to ensure that is non - vanishing , we assume @xmath91 , split the @xmath92 factors of @xmath30 into a group of @xmath1 , to be put one on each boundary , and the remaining @xmath93 pairs into @xmath1 groups of arbitrary size .    assuming the @xmath30 s are initially indistinguishable",
    ", this introduces a combinatorial factor of @xmath94 so that we get : @xmath95 where we use @xmath96 , the boundary state @xmath97 as well as @xmath98 .",
    "now the sum over @xmath1 in is restricted to those @xmath1 with the same parity as @xmath92 . as above , we write @xmath99 , and sum over @xmath100 .",
    "this yields e^m h^n_&= & _ g=0^_s=0^m/2 _ c^2g-2 _ o^m-2s _ ^1-g+s - m2 ^ -s + & = & _ s=0^m/2_o^m-2s _ ^s - m 2 ^ -s  .",
    "the last sum in this expression is a certain hypergeometric polynomial . in order to check",
    "whether the symmetry ( [ symmetry1 ] ) remains in the presence of boundaries , it is useful to compute @xmath101 in the general deformation we get in a straightforward fashion : @xmath102 we can rescale the boundary operator by @xmath103 .",
    "we then see that although we have introduced four parameters @xmath104 for the open plus closed system , the correlation functions in the presence of boundaries depend only on two parameters @xmath105 ( for fixed choice of @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that in the presence of boundaries both signs of @xmath44 are not allowed simultaneously .",
    "it is then obvious the symmetry ( [ symmetry1 ] ) of the closed tft is preserved by the open plus closed system , provided we require that we keep @xmath106 invariant .",
    "this works , whether or not we relate the open string coupling to the closed coupling , such as implied by unitarity in string theory . on the other hand",
    ", we do not see any new duality appearing in the open string sector .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sum over boundaries is less singular ( a polynomial ) than the sum over genera , which gives a pole at @xmath107 .",
    "this may be interpreted as an analogue of the fact that standard closed string ( gravity ) perturbation theory is more singular than open string ( gauge theory ) perturbation theory . in string theory",
    ", this distinction arises because of the properties of the moduli space of riemann surfaces after coupling to worldsheet gravity , which we have not done .",
    "a way to view open / closed string theory duality is that summing up the open string degrees of freedom results in modifying the closed string background .",
    "schematically , @xmath108 here @xmath109 and @xmath110 denote all the open and closed string moduli , and @xmath111 are the modified closed string moduli due to the open strings back reaction .",
    "a natural question is whether we can see such a duality in our open / closed topological field theory .",
    "we will see that in the absence of worldsheet gravity , summing up the open string degrees of freedom results in a renormalization of the closed tft operator .",
    "the generating functional @xmath112 for the correlators of the type @xmath113 is characterized by the property @xmath114 as noted before , @xmath115 is defined with the same @xmath44 as the d - brane boundary condition .",
    "there are also the observables @xmath116 .",
    "however , correlators @xmath116 with the other observables have only the disconnected parts",

    "recall that we can replace a boundary with an insertion of the boundary operator @xmath30 by using the operator @xmath121 as described by equations ( [ boundaryr ] ) and ( [ ve ] ) .",
    "we need to sum over the boundaries with any number of ( odd ) @xmath122 inserted on each boundary .",
    "consider first one boundary .",
    "we have @xmath123 \\ . \\label{onebound}\\ ] ] now we need to sum over the number of boundaries , which exponentiates ( [ onebound ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved in the generating functional by modifying t_h _ _ h _",
    "= t_h _ + _ o ( ) ^1/2  .",
    "thus , the generating functional for the open plus closed topological @xmath6-model ( [ openplclosed ] ) is obtained by using the change ( [ shift ] ) in the generating functional of the closed topological @xmath6-model ( [ closed ] ) .",
    "we see that summing up the open string degrees of freedom results in a renormalization of the closed string operator @xmath115 by adding to it an infinite series of the boundary operator @xmath30 , weighted by @xmath124 and the open string coupling @xmath86 .      in this subsection",
    ", we explore some alternative combinatorial rules for summing over boundaries , in view of simplifying open - closed duality . to appreciate these alternatives",
    ", one has to realize that while the set of correlation functions satisfies the axioms of tfts , we know of no a priori constraints on how to choose the combinatorial factors in summing over worldsheet topologies .",
    "this freedom is a consequence of the fact that we do not couple here the tft to a worldsheet gravity .",
    "a related expectation is that eventually the ambiguities in summing the holes will be be removed by the uncovering of a new symmetry that should be maintained by the factors or by some other consistency argument . in the absence of this guiding principle we here advocate considering various possibilities mentioning each time an additional physical input , which would select that particular choice .",
    "we also include one choice , whose sole present motivation is the interesting result it implies on open - closed string duality .",
    "it displays a property consistent with our prejudices .",
    "the fact that other choices do not lead to that result should be kept as a cautionary fact as long as no new consistency conditions are uncovered .    as before",
    ", we assume the background of one d - brane labeled @xmath44 , and use our formula for the perturbative correlators .",
    "we now sum over genera , number of boundaries , and the number of bulk and boundary insertions . as before , we write @xmath99 .",
    "this leads to the full free energy : @xmath125 the first factor is from geometric sum over genus .",
    "the second is the exponential factor from summing over bulk insertions .",
    "the last factor however is from devil s kitchen , and can not be done in a closed form .",
    "note however that it does contain @xmath126 , which might be intuitively expected from indistinguishability of the boundaries .",
    "we now invoke the right to modify the combinatorial factor involved in summing over boundary insertions .",
    "for example , we might consider replacing @xmath127 with @xmath128 if we decided not to count the first insertion that goes on each boundary to make the correlator non - zero . a physical way to justify this modification is to consider d - branes on which we have `` turned on '' the @xmath30 insertion .",
    "the mathematical advantage is that we are now able to do the sum : @xmath129 where @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "so @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "this result does not to allow an interpretation as an open - closed string duality , with a closed dual theory being a deformation of the original tft .",
    "we are therefore encouraged to look for other possibilities .",
    "another possible proposal for the combinatorial factor is to claim that we should only count boundary insertions in pairs .",
    "this would mean putting @xmath134 in the sum , which becomes @xmath135 with @xmath130 as before and @xmath136 . then @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "this result is quite similar to , without a manifest open - closed duality .    by way of answer analysis , one may check that in order to obtain a standard open - closed duality , we would need the combinatorial factor for summing over boundary insertions to be @xmath139 then the sum becomes @xmath140 in this scheme , the effect of integrating out the open strings is a shift of the closed string parameter @xmath141 note , however , that we do not currently have a physical justification for . also , the @xmath142 .",
    "term deserves a better understanding .",
    "in this section , we initiate a systematic attempt to couple the open - closed topological @xmath19 model to topological gravity , starting from first principles ( , without using dualities of any sort ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this has not been attempted before , mostly , it appears , because the notion of open topological gravity is severely under - developed , and naively mathematically ill - defined .",
    "( we believe , however , that a sensible version exists . ) as in the previous sections , we here take a pragmatic approach , leaving justifications to future work .",
    "the key to success will be to consider only gravitational descendants in the bulk , and not on the boundary .",
    "when coupling the closed topological @xmath19 @xmath6-model to topological gravity , we have the following operators : in the closed sector we have the puncture operator @xmath143 that fixes a point in the bulk of the worldsheet ( creates a puncture ) , and the primary operator @xmath23 .",
    "in addition we have the gravitational descendants @xmath144 .",
    "when all couplings are turned off , we have the following non - vanishing correlators at genus @xmath145 @xcite @xmath146 the first equation is the contribution from the degree @xmath145 sector , and the second from sector with instanton number @xmath147 .",
    "note the difference to the correlators without coupling to topological gravity .",
    "most succinctly , this change can be seen in the selection rule . without coupling to topological gravity , this selection rule is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the number of insertions of @xmath23 , and @xmath41 is the instanton number ( the degree of the map @xmath150 ) coupling to topological gravity modifies this to @xmath151 where @xmath152 is number of insertions of puncture operator .",
    "note that @xmath149 drops out of , whereas does not depend on @xmath152 .",
    "now note that in models such as @xmath19 , insertions of operators correspond to ordinary derivatives with respect to the corresponding couplings , , @xmath153 this implies that the relations can be summarized in the following generating function ( `` prepotential '' ) @xmath154 equivalently , on the small phase space , we have the correlators @xmath155 to study the large phase space ( turn on coupling to descendants ) , it is a good idea to rewrite as `` constitutive relations '' .",
    "namely , as emphasized in @xcite , _ the functional form of the correlators is unchanged if we express them as functions of the coordinates _",
    "@xmath156 using this , the constitutive relation of @xmath19 is @xmath157 to show that holds on the large phase space , it is enough to show that the derivatives with respect to the descendant couplings @xmath158 and @xmath159 vanish for @xmath160 . for this , let s temporarily drop the @xmath161 subscript and consider @xmath162 where @xmath10 is @xmath143 or @xmath23 , and we have turned on arbitrary values of all the couplings . now @xmath163 where we have used the topological recursion relations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand @xmath164 now and together with at @xmath165 imply that the constitutive relations hold on the large phase space as well .",
    "in the open sector we have the operator @xmath166 that fixes a point on the boundary of the worldsheet and the primary operator @xmath30 .",
    "as we will argue , there are no gravitational descendants of the boundary primary operators .",
    "now let us add the a - brane wrapped on the equator of @xmath19 , with trivial gauge field , and consider the disk amplitude .",
    "relevant instantons are now maps @xmath167 any such map can be complex conjugated to a map from @xmath150 , and we call the instanton number to be the ordinary degree of this doubled map .",
    "note however that the requirement that the boundary of the disk map to the a - brane implies that the dimension of moduli space of such real maps is half of what it was in the complex case .    before coupling to topological gravity ,",
    "the selection rule is @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the number of insertions of the boundary operator @xmath30 .",
    "note that is an equality on _ real dimensions_. after coupling to gravity , the selection rule becomes @xmath170    now let us try to write down some correlators of primaries , after coupling to topological gravity .",
    "first of all , the selection rule allows only solutions for @xmath171 and @xmath172 . from @xmath171",
    ", we find a non - vanishing correlator from @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath175 which simply comes from the constant map to the point dual to @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath176 , @xmath177 , we get @xmath178 however , any further insertion of @xmath30 , or trying to insert @xmath23 instead of @xmath30 , gives a vanishing result , because a constant map can only map to a single point .",
    "( ultimately , this statement might require some rectification in view of below . )    now what about instanton sector 1 , in which implies we have no insertions of puncture operators ?",
    "first , note that there are two maps in this sector : the map covering the northern half of the sphere , and the map covering the southern half of the sphere .",
    "second , consider correlators with only boundary insertions .",
    "the first non - trivial one to consider is @xmath179 . before coupling to gravity",
    ", only one of the two possible instantons contributed to this amplitude because of the fixing of the cyclic ordering of the boundary insertions .",
    "specifically , in the topological sigma model before coupling to gravity , the amplitude is defined by @xmath180 where the @xmath181 are some _ fixed _ insertion points on the boundary of the disk .",
    "thinking of the latter as the upper half plane with boundary the real line , we can choose the three insertion points to be @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "now to compute , we choose three generic points @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 on the a - brane ( equator of @xmath19 ) , each representing the poincar dual of the cohomology class @xmath30 generating @xmath188 , and count the number of maps ( instantons ) mapping @xmath181 to @xmath189 .",
    "it is not hard to see that depending on the cyclic ordering of @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , such a degree one map has to cover either the northern or the southern hemisphere .",
    "after coupling to topological gravity , the situation changes dramatically .",
    "the definition of the amplitude now involves an _ integration _ over the position of the insertion points , and dividing by the isometry group @xmath190 ( in contrast , the definition of a priori depends on @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 ) .",
    "although the @xmath190 symmetry of the disk still allows us to fix the three insertion points at @xmath145 , @xmath147 , and @xmath194 , we have to allow _ both possible cyclic orderings_. hence , both hemispheres contribute to the correlator .",
    "it us natural to assume that they contribute with opposite sign .",
    "( justifying this requires a more careful study of orientation of the relevant moduli spaces from which we refrain here . )",
    "this implies that _ after coupling to topological gravity _",
    ", @xmath195 continuing in this vein , we can add further boundary insertions .",
    "each time , both hemispheres contribute because we can always arrange both required cyclic orderings of insertion points on the boundary of the disk . for an even number of insertions ,",
    "the two come with the same sign , and for an odd number of insertions , we get a cancelation .",
    "( this is a consequence of the fermionic nature of @xmath30 . )",
    "thus @xmath196 finally , we consider correlators with insertion of @xmath23 .",
    "a seemingly simple correlator to compute is @xmath197 .",
    "naively , one chooses a point @xmath198 on the equator to represent @xmath30 , and a point @xmath199 in the bulk to represent @xmath23 .",
    "using @xmath190 invariance to put insertion of @xmath23 at @xmath200 the center of the disk , and insertion of @xmath30 at say @xmath201 say , one looks for a map that maps the center of the disk to @xmath199 and @xmath201 on the boundary to @xmath198 . there is a single such map in instanton sector @xmath147 .",
    "it is the northern or southern hemisphere depending on where @xmath199 is chosen .",
    "so one might conclude naively @xmath202 we claim , however , that this equation , _ is wrong_. to see this , imagine we wanted to compute @xmath203 by choosing a second bulk point @xmath204 to which we want to map a second bulk point @xmath205 .",
    "since the map was already fixed by @xmath198 and @xmath199 , it boils down to the question of whether the second point @xmath205 , in the interior of the disk ( over which we are integrating ) can be chosen such that it maps to @xmath204 .",
    "the answer to this question _ now depends on whether we choose @xmath204 in the northern or southern hemisphere _ ! but clearly , the amplitude can not depend on the choice of representative for @xmath23 , so something must be wrong with the reasoning leading to .",
    "it is quite easy to see where the problem comes from on the worldsheet , which also suggests the resolution .",
    "what we are trying to do is insert @xmath206 into the path integral and claim that it gives something well - defined if we think of @xmath207 as a cohomology class in @xmath208 .",
    "but clearly if we change the representative @xmath209 , changes by a boundary term @xmath210 the well - known way to resolve this is to add explicit boundary term in the form of the wilson line @xmath211 mathematically , speaking , we have to think of @xmath207 as a relative cohomology class in @xmath212 .",
    "thinking this through , we learn that the correct and invariant way to represent the operator @xmath23 is as the sum of a point in one of the hemispheres of @xmath19 together with @xmath213 times a point on the equator . specifically , we need a point @xmath214 on the equator , oriented such that its intersection with the equator in positive ( east - west ) direction is @xmath215 , and in negative direction @xmath216",
    ". then if @xmath217 is a generic point in the northern hemisphere , we can represent @xmath23 as a relative cohomology class by @xmath218 ( alternatively , we could use a point @xmath219 in the southern hemisphere to represent @xmath23 as @xmath220 ) .",
    "how does this identification repair and the conundrum below it ?",
    "well , the net effect will be that both hemispheres contribute to the amplitude , canceling each other , so that @xmath221 .",
    "but to justify this , it is easier to consider an amplitude with more insertions so that we have an actual moduli space to play with .",
    "consider for example adding a bulk insertion to , in other words the amplitude @xmath222 .",
    "having represented @xmath23 by @xmath223 means that the map to the northern hemisphere contributes @xmath215 , when the bulk insertion is at a regular point of the disk .",
    "but in the compactification of the moduli space of the disk with marked points , we have to bubble off disks whenever bulk insertions approach the boundary . with three marked points on the boundary ,",
    "the added configuration consists of two disks , joined at a common node .",
    "the first disk carries four marked boundary points ( the three original ones plus the node ) , and the other the bulk point plus the node on the boundary . in mapping this to @xmath224 ,",
    "we collapse the bubbled disk . since after the collapse",
    ", we are just required to map the node to @xmath214 , which is a point on the equator , we can do this with either the northern or southern hemisphere .",
    "they contribute with the same sign .",
    "thus , the northern hemisphere contributes @xmath225 , while the southern hemisphere contributes @xmath226 , for a total amplitude of @xmath227    we can extract the general logic from this example : an extra insertion of @xmath23 , represented rationally by @xmath223 changes the contribution of the northern hemisphere by @xmath228 , where the @xmath147 comes from a bulk insertion being mapped to @xmath217 , and the @xmath226 comes from the bulk insertion moving to the boundary , bubbling off a disk , which is subsequently collapsed to an additional boundary insertion , and mapped to @xmath214 .",
    "the contribution of the southern hemisphere changes by a factor of @xmath229 , coming entirely from the bubbled configuration .",
    "( the sign is negative of the bubbled configuration on the northern hemisphere because the boundary is oriented oppositely . ) with very few insertions ,",
    "the argument is somewhat delicate to carry out , but the general conclusion is @xmath230 these results can be summarized in the generating function @xmath231 where the polynomial piece is somewhat unclear at this point , for reasons explained above .    we are now prepared to turn on gravitational descendants and study the analogue of the constitutive relations .",
    "first of all , let us argue that there are no gravitational descendants of boundary operators .",
    "if there were any , they should have a cohomological definition , most likely involving the tangent space to the boundary , fitting together to a real line bundle over the moduli space @xmath232 .",
    "but the only characteristic class of such a real line is the first stieffel - whitney class , which is a torsion class in @xmath233 .",
    "since one can not build intersection theory on torsion classes , it is pretty much excluded that one can have gravitational descendants as actual `` local operators '' . on the other hand , and guided by intuition gained from mirror symmetry on threefolds , see , @xcite , it seems likely that the torsion classes can actually be used to define discrete observables similar to domain walls . in other words , we have not derivatives of amplitudes with respect to would - be couplings , but finite differences between certain `` d - brane vacua '' .",
    "second , we make the assumption that the primary operators on the boundary should be on - shell .",
    "namely such that all one - point functions @xmath234 , @xmath235 , where @xmath236 are arbitrary bulk insertions , should vanish . referring back to",
    ", we learn that @xmath237 , and @xmath238 .",
    "these two solutions are precisely the two choices of wilson lines that we have met before .",
    "this decision to freeze open string moduli is again motivated by the calabi - yau threefold case .",
    "we will see that it is a very useful technical assumption that allows solving the theory completely ( which we will do at tree - level ) .",
    "indeed , without boundary couplings , the small and large phase space are unchanged from the purely closed string case .",
    "we just have additional observables .",
    "so we begin by writing the disk amplitudes as functions of the topological coordinates .",
    "consulting , we see that on - shell , @xmath239 this equation can be viewed as a natural squareroot of , very much in agreement with the `` real topological string paradigm '' developed in @xcite    we now claim that also holds on the large phase space , with non - zero ( bulk ) descendant couplings @xmath240 . to show this",
    ", we proceed as in .",
    "the derivative of the right hand side is @xmath241 let us check that the left - hand side gives the same @xmath242 we wish to rewrite this using topological recursion relations .",
    "there are two possible degenerations that could make a contribution .",
    "the first is when the two bulk insertions come close together , leading to the bubbling of a sphere at the center of the disk .",
    "the local situation is as on the sphere , so we can readily copy @xcite to conclude that the contribution is @xmath243 the second degeneration occurs when a bulk insertion moves to the boundary , leading to the bubbling of a disk , as we have seen in our discussion of the off - shell correlators . on - shell however , such degenerations make no contribution because disk one - point functions vanish .",
    "thus we find @xmath244 and comparison with shows as in the bulk that holds on the large phase as well .",
    "in the paper , we made some steps towards an understanding of the summation over boundaries in topological field theories and in topological strings .",
    "we calculated the correlation functions of the bulk and boundary operators in topological sigma - model on @xmath2 , studied the symmetries of the model and the open / closed tft correspondence .",
    "we then coupled the model to topological gravity and derived constitutive relations between the correlation functions of bulk and boundary operators .",
    "there are various directions that are worth exploring , in particular when coupling to topological gravity .",
    "already before summing over boundaries it is interesting to ask how does the coupling to topological gravity affect the duality relation in the closed tft . in the case of @xmath19 target space , the partition function is related to the tau function of the toda hierarchy ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and one may consider the symmetries of the latter .",
    "integrability is an important issue when considering topological gravity already without matter tft but in the presence of boundaries . when there are no boundaries we have the generating function for the correlators f(t_0,t_1 , ... ) = ( _ i=1^ t_i _",
    "i ) is the @xmath245-function of the kdv hierarchy @xcite .",
    "is there an analogous structure with the inclusion of boundaries and the boundary puncture operator ?",
    "an analysis of the coupling of the model to topological gravity seems most rewarding . in particular",
    ", can one justify more rigorously our statements about open topological gravity such as the absence of boundary descendants .",
    "it is also a reasonable question to ask for the differential equations satisfied by the all - genus , all - boundaries partition function .",
    "there is a relation between the partition function of the closed a - model on @xmath19 and the generating functional for certain correlation functions of supersymmetric gauge theory on @xmath246 @xcite .",
    "it would be natural to ask whether there is an analogous relation in the presence of boundaries .",
    "this project was started a very long time ago , and we acknowledge the hospitality of several institutions , especially , kitp santa barbara , ias princeton , hebrew university , and cern , over the course of the collaboration . e.r .",
