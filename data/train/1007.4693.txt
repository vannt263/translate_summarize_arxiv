    "one of important problems in the physics of galaxies is the identification of the main factor that increases the random velocity from @xmath5  km / s ( young population ) to the values of @xmath6  km / s ( observed in old stellar population ) . besides such factors of heating as the scattering of stars by giant molecular clouds ( @xcite ) and in the spiral arms ( @xcite ) ,",

    "the most important result from the papers mentioned above is that the area of stability in the parametric space depends on the spherical subsystem mass . once the halo is massive enough",
    ", the systems with low velocity dispersion can be unstable .",
    "this gives an example of destabilizing role of the halo . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher mass of the spherical subsystem requires the lower ratio of @xmath63 that is necessary to keep the disc gravitationally stable . as a result",
    ", the destabilizing role of the massive halo related to the large scale bending perturbations may not reveal itself ( @xcite ) .",
    "our model stellar discs at the initial moment ( @xmath64 ) are axisymmetric , in the equilibrium state along both the radial and vertical directions and gravitationally stable in the disc plane .",
    "the latter is made by assigning a high value to the radial velocity dispersion @xmath65 , where the toomre stability parameter @xmath66 is a function of @xmath67 ( @xcite ) . in general",
    ", our initial disc templates can be either stable or unstable against the bending perturbations in dependence of @xmath9 distribution .",
    "the evolution of systems with a small initial value of @xmath15 ( i.e. systems that are dynamically cold in the vertical direction ) reveals a gradual growth of the global bending instability , which heats up the disc in the vertical direction and increases its thickness .",

[ fig1 ] .",
    "we fix the units hereafter assuming that @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in this case",
    "the circular velocity @xmath78 at the periphery of the disc and the corresponding dimensionless rotation period is @xmath79 .    as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , parameters of the disc stay almost unchanged for the first 2.5 turns ( @xmath80 in our units ) .",
    "this time the instability modes are being developed at the linear stage of the bending instability evolution .",
    "after @xmath81 , the linear stage is superseded by the non - linear development of the bending instability , and the centre of mass @xmath82 oscillates with larger amplitude in the @xmath13-direction ( see fig .  [",
    "the amplitude @xmath82 rapidly increases in the central regions of the disc up to its maximum value and then decreases down to the initial state ( see curves 15 in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , whereas the increasing of @xmath82 occurs much slower at the outer parts of the disc ( curves 1119 ) .",
    "the rapid growth of the velocity dispersion @xmath7 and scale height @xmath44 begins after a time delay from @xmath82 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b and c. a flare of stellar disc emerges in its central region and then propagates outside , towards the periphery .",
    "the value of @xmath15 rises mostly because of @xmath7 growth , and in less power due to @xmath11 decreasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d and e ) .",
    "the azimuthal component of the velocity dispersion @xmath83 follows @xmath11 , so the relation @xmath84 is valid almost everywhere .",
    "this equation can be failed either in a very thick disc ( @xmath85 ) , or in the very central region , where @xmath86 , that means the anisotropy is lower in those regions because of the system spherization .",
    "decreasing of @xmath11 and @xmath83 is the result of conversion of the kinetic energy of random motions in the disc plane to the kinetic energy of random vertical motions .",
    "note that development of this bending mode takes place in the disc which is initially axisymmetric over all parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath87 has opposite signs at the disc centre and periphery in the considering model ( see fig .  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "this generates a `` mexican hat - like '' structure as a result of this instability ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the isolines of @xmath87 have concentric shape . the intermediate regions and periphery",
    "at the moment @xmath88 are shifted off the disc plane toward the opposite directions , whereas the central region ( @xmath89 ) has returned to its initial position , see fig .",
    "the disc vertical structure driven by the bending mode @xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "we can see a formation of box - shaped features in the disc , which is typical for all moments of evolution when the axisymmetric bending mode dominates .",
    "note that this feature is not relevant to a bar .",
    "the considered instability may be responsible for the formation of central thickening of discs ( i.e. bulges ) , and for the structure of s0 galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) ) .    a gradual change of the velocity dispersions @xmath7 and @xmath11 and rotational velocity @xmath90 begins when the amplitude of the vertical oscillations @xmath87 grows significantly .",
    "the vertical disc heating is accompanied by the increasing of @xmath15 , but favourable conditions for developing the bending instability disappear at certain values of @xmath15 . as a result , new stable and thick disc forms .",
    "the specific time for this process depends significantly on the model parameters and is of the order of ten turns of the disc s outer regions .",
    "if the initial distribution of @xmath91 was subcritical , the linear stage takes longer time due to low increment of instability , and because of the heating at the non - linear stage was feeble .",
    "the amplitude of the bending mode , and even the ability of its emergence , depends significantly on the initial radial distribution of @xmath15 .",
    "an important consequence is that the final distribution of @xmath92 , as a result of bending instability , depends on its initial value @xmath93 .",
    "after development of the global bending instability , those thin discs that had a low value of the scale height ratio gain larger ratio @xmath15 than it would required to keep the discs stable .",
    "the explanation can be found in the essentially non - linear nature of the disc heating . as a result , the parameter @xmath15 `` jumps over '' the `` border of stability '' and comes to relaxation well above its marginal threshold .",
    "we verified the numerical effects of our tree - code by reproducing the most important numerical experiments with a direct particle - particle ( pp hereafter ) code , see description by @xcite .",
    "the analogue of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that was obtained with the help of pp code that started from the same initial conditions and was evaluated with only @xmath94 particles is shown in fig .",
    "the residuals in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are greater than those in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] due to less number of particles . nevertheless , all features from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "if the model disc is not massive enough to provide the gravitational stability against the bar - mode and mass of the halo is low ( @xmath95 ) , the main reason for heating the initially thin cold disc is the axisymmetric bending mode ( @xmath68 ) whereas the modes @xmath96 do not emerge at all .",
    "note that the mode @xmath68 may emerge far from the centre ( @xmath97 ) and develop there without penetrating into the central part of the disc . it can happen because of two reasons : either the initial disc had @xmath98 ( see   3.4 ) and was stable in the central regions whereas periphery of the disc is thin and unstable ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , or the galaxy harbours a concentrated and massive bulge . in such models the bending modes in the centre",
    "have low amplitude .",
    "the presence of a bulge and/or a halo plays a stabilizing role .",
    "hence , having all other conditions equal , the discs of galaxies possessing bulges have to look thinner .",
    "note that since we did not consider dynamically non - stationary bulges in our model , this our conclusion requires further investigation .      in the models with massive halo ( @xmath99 ) ,",
    "the axisymmetric bending modes @xmath100 and @xmath101 may develop themselves and heat up the stellar disc along its vertical direction .",
    "the surface density of the disc remains axisymmetric .",
    "the evolution of initially thin disc for a case of a heavy halo @xmath102 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in this case",
    "the bending mode @xmath101 is developed initially in the inner disc regions ( @xmath16 ) , see the saddle - like features in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the distribution of @xmath87 in the disc plane for certain moments between @xmath64 and @xmath103 ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . the vertical heating and disc s flare due to the mode @xmath101 are very modest in this case .",
    "however , a non - linear one - arm asymmetric mode @xmath100 emerges after @xmath104 and the vertical heating gets more significant .",
    "the third stage of the heating starts at @xmath105 when the mode @xmath68 begins to dominate all over the disc .",
    "the growth rate of the vertical dispersion @xmath7 is especially high at this time : the disc scale height increases by a factor of 2  3 .",
    "the example considered shows the process of transformation between the bending modes and transition from the asymmetric mode @xmath101 to the axisymmetric one . in the case of a low - massive spherical subsystem of low mass , the favourable conditions for emerging the global bending instability get worse and the disc warp does not emerge in the disc for at least 20 rotation turns if the initial @xmath91 is high enough .",
    "if the initial template was too far from the stability limit , the disc `` jumps over '' the stability limit , and then its final state essentially exceeds this limit . thus finally produces overstabilized and too thick disc . since such stellar discs are not obviously observed , we have to assume that the initial state of the discs was not too far from the stability limit .",
    "note that it agrees with a gradual building of stellar discs from gas or via minor merging when the initial discs do not emerge instantly but are built for a continuous time from small fragments , which adjust to the discs stability limit .",
    "in the course of experiments with low massive halo ( @xmath106 ) , if the initial state of disc is gravitationally unstable , a bar can emerge .",
    "the bar formation is accompanied by its warping ( as reported by @xcite ) .",
    "bending of the bar can be a result of global instability of the bar - mode during its initial stage when the bar forms in the initially thin cold disc .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the bar bendings that increase the vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "amplitude of the bar warps decreases essentially when the bar thickness increases .",
    "we stress that once the bar has been formed , it stops the further possible developing of the global bending modes , and first of all it destroys the axisymmetric instability with mode @xmath68 .",
    "the bar formation runs faster while the initial disc is cold ( i.e. for small values of toomre s parameter @xmath107 ) and as a result , amplitude of bar s bending mode increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "if the initial disc lays in a slightly subcritical state ( @xmath11 is just below the level that provides the stability to the global bar - mode ) , the bar emerges very slowly , and it is stable against the bending perturbations , i.e. the bending of a bar does not necessarily emerge in the modelling .",
    "the key parameter responsible for stability of the stellar discs is the ratio @xmath108 . to stabilize the global bending instabilities in the case of low values of relative mass of the spherical subsystem in a model",
    ", the value of @xmath15 has to be greater than @xmath109 , as it was figured out from linear analysis of simple models ( @xcite ) .",
    "let s consider a bulgeless model with a moderate halo @xmath110 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the initial ( curve 1 ) and final ( curve 2 ) distributions of @xmath92 are shown in fig .",
    "the vertical heating generated by the axisymmetric bending mode is as strong that the averaged over the disc ratio @xmath111 .",
    "once the relative mass of halo is chosen to be higher , the ratio @xmath15 needed to marginally stabilize the bending perturbations ( we refer to it as the critical ratio @xmath112 hereafter ) gets less .",
    "one can see the initial ( curve 1 ) and final ( curve 2 ) distributions of @xmath92 for the case of very massive halo with @xmath102 in fig .",
    "the curve 3 shows the initial distribution of @xmath92 , which is necessary to provide stability against the global bending modes . at the same time , at the disc periphery @xmath113 .",
    "a distinctive feature of the considered models at the threshold of bending stability is the non - uniformity of @xmath15 along the radius ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . for the case of moderate halo ( @xmath114 ) with the initial distribution of @xmath10 that suppresses the bar instability ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath112 is a descending monotonous function of @xmath67 .",
    "its value ranges from 0.5 @xmath115 0.6 at the central regions to 0.3 @xmath115 0.4 at the periphery ( see fig .",
