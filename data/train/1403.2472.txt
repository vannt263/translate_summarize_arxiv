    "in order to derive the form of the scaling function in eqn .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , we need to first understand how a cutoff , which we will call @xmath105 , is implemented in the numerical methodology , the tcsa+nrg @xcite , used to study this system .",
    "this method is able to study any hamiltonian which can be written as a perturbed conformal field theory : @xmath106 where here in this case @xmath107 is a theory of four bosons , @xmath108 , the coupling @xmath109 equals @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the method uses the hilbert space of @xmath107 as a computational basis .",
    "( for details see refs .",
    "this computational basis is optimal because the exact computation of matrix elements of @xmath112 is readily done using the commutation relations of the governing algebra of the unperturbed conformal theory , the virasoro algebra .",
    "being able to compute these matrix elements means @xmath113 can be recast as a matrix . for this matrix to be a finite matrix ,",
    "we need to truncate the hilbert space of @xmath107 .",
    "the unperturbed energies of the eigenstates of @xmath107 , @xmath114 , appearing in the excitonic sector have the form @xmath115 where the @xmath116 are integers and @xmath117 is the central charge of a single boson ( @xmath118 ) . to implement the cutoff",
    "we then insist that the integers , @xmath116 , satisfy @xmath119 .",
    "this allows us to define the cutoff of this method as @xmath120    with this in hand , the next step in the derivation of the scaling form is to write down the @xmath121-function of the coupling constant @xmath122 : @xmath123 in principle @xmath124 can be determined analytically  we however extract it numerically from the tcsa data . this numerical determination is what is used to plot @xmath46 in fig .",
    "the form this @xmath121-function has can be determined following ref .",
    "@xcite by insisting that the partition function of the theory remains invariant under changes in the cutoff @xmath125 . in the gapped phase of the theory with @xmath32 sufficiently large this is equivalent to insisting the gaps of the theory are invariant under the rg flow .",
    "if we integrate this @xmath121-function we obtain an expression relating the coupling in the absence of a cutoff to that with a cutoff : @xmath126 the gaps , @xmath127 , in the absence of a cutoff , depend on the coupling @xmath128 via the relation , @xmath129 a simple consequence of dimensional analysis ( taking into account the anomalous dimensions of the coupling constant , @xmath54 ) . by rg invariance",
    "we have @xmath130 . so substituting this into eqn .",
    "[ mass_rel ] and using eqn .",
    "[ intbfun ] we obtain the desired scaling form : @xmath131",
    "the only issue is that this is expressed in terms of the tcsa cutoff @xmath132 that arises from our numerical treatment of the problem and not the effective bandwidth of the tube , @xmath52 .    to determine the relationship between @xmath52 and @xmath105 we begin by",
    "consider the bosonization formula giving the right / left moving fermion , @xmath133 , in terms of a normal ordered vertex operator of a boson : @xmath134 in writing this expression we have dropped prefactors , zero modes , and klein factors  for our purposes what matters is the normal ordered exponential .",
    "the key to the relationship between @xmath52 and @xmath105 is found in the relation between the normal ordered vertex operator and its unnormal ordered counterpart : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the euler constant and the factor @xmath137 ensures the engineering dimension of the normal ordered vertex operator matches its anomalous dimension .",
    "the appearance of @xmath138 reflects our use of the tcsa cutoff to regulate the uv divergences that normal ordering exhibits in the theory .",
    "when we initially bosonize the theory , the total charge boson is normal ordered assuming @xmath43 .",
    "when we rediagonalize the theory , absorbing the forward scattering part of the coulomb interaction into the quadratic part of @xmath113 , we have to adjust the normal ordering to take into account @xmath139 .",
    "we do so as follows : @xmath140 where the subscripts @xmath141 indicate the value of @xmath1 for which the normal ordering is being done .",
    "we use @xmath142 instead of @xmath125 as @xmath142 governs the maximal energy in the total charge ( c+ ) sector of the theory , not the entire theory itself .",
    "the two are related via @xmath143 assuming an equipartition of energy between the four bosons in the theory .",
    "it is this difference in normal ordering prefactors that is absorbed into the bare coupling : @xmath144 this then implies ( comparing the above with the relation below eqn .",
    "( [ hgap ] ) in the main body of the text ) @xmath145 with this relation , we can now place the scaling function into its final form , eqn .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , substituting @xmath52 for @xmath146 in eqn .",
    "( [ scaling1 ] ) .    [ [ corrections - to - excitonic - energies - due - to - intersubband - interactions ] ] corrections to excitonic energies due to intersubband interactions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in this section we will compute the corrections to excitonic energies due to interactions between subbands .",
    "we will demonstrate that they are proportional to @xmath147 where @xmath117 is the speed of light and so is small .",
    "consider an excitonic excitation in subband i with energy @xmath148 .",
    "the forward scattering portion of the intersubband coulomb interaction ( as with the intrasubband interactions , the strongest part of the coulomb interaction ) takes the form @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the density in the @xmath151th subband . in the long wavelength limit",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath152 where @xmath153 and we have used in the second line the bosonized expressions for the electron densities in the subbands .    in second order perturbation theory",
    "the correction to @xmath148 takes the form @xmath154 where @xmath155 is some excitation in the @xmath156th subband with parity odd symmetry ( i.e. odd under @xmath157 ) with energy @xmath158 .",
    "the lowest energy such excitations are the one - photon excitons in subband @xmath159 .",
    "the state @xmath160 is the ground state of the @xmath156th subband .",
    "the matrix elements that we to evaluate in this sum take the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are @xmath94 constants ( as can be verified numerically ) and @xmath164 are the momenta of the excitations @xmath165/@xmath155 .",
    "thus the energy correction takes the form @xmath166 as one can see this correction vanishes as the momentum of the exciton goes to zero .",
    "typically the momentum of an optically excited exciton will be equal to @xmath167 , implying that @xmath168 is proportional to @xmath169 and so is very small ."

    "<S> but we will see the same constant works over tubes with a wide variety of radii , different subbands within the same tube , and tubes in different dielectric environments . </S>",
    "<S> we will also see , as an important self - consistency check , that this same relation determines the finite bandwidth corrections to the excitonic gaps of higher subbands .    to this end the gap , @xmath62 , of any excitation @xmath63 ( exciton , single particle , or otherwise ) takes the following universal scaling form @xmath64 with @xmath65 and where @xmath66 is a scaling function . </S>",
    "<S> it takes the form @xmath67 @xmath68 governs the gap in the large bandwidth , @xmath69 , limit and was already determined in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however not previously considered , the scaling function sees corrections at finite bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections will be important for predicting accurately the excitonic gaps of excitons in the higher subbands . </S>",

    "<S> the results for the scaling functions for the optically active excitons , @xmath45 , and the particle - hole continuum , @xmath42 , are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a as a function of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we see the scaling function for @xmath45 is relatively flat as a function of @xmath1 while that of @xmath42 varies comparatively sharply . in the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 tends to 1 ( the non - interacting limit ) , the scaling function @xmath72 tends to 2 ( i.e. the exciton energy is that of the bare ( non - interacting ) particle - hole continuum gap ) . in the limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 tends to 0 , @xmath73 , only going to infinity slowly . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath74 , grows much more quickly , going as @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus quantified the general observation @xcite that the renormalization of the single particle gap due to coulomb interactions is much more marked than that of the excitons . </S>",
    "<S> it is also much stronger than has been suggested in rpa - type computations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also immediately infer that the binding energy of the exciton as a fraction of the exciton energy grows as @xmath76 as @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> * analysis of experimental data * : we now examine how this theoretical approach fares in predicting the excitonic data of refs . @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these papers present excitonic gaps of tubes for a wide range of diameters and subbands as well as different dielectric environments . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to test the flexibility of the above theoretical scheme .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite measurements were performed on a set of four larger diameter tubes ( d running from 1.86 nm to 2.14 nm ) . in each of the four tubes , the first four single photon excitons , @xmath45 , @xmath78 , were measured . @xmath79 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 were studied by suspending the nanotubes and using rayleigh scattering spectroscopy . in these measurements </S>",
    "<S> the relevant dielectric constant was @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> these same tubes were then printed onto a silicon wafer where source and drain electrons were patterned . </S>",
    "<S> this enabled @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be measured by a complimentary technique , fourier - transform photoconductivity . in this configuration the effective dielectric constant of the tubes </S>",
    "<S> is the average of air and silicon dioxide , @xmath83 , a result easily derived from considering the effective potential between two charges confined to the interface of two media with different dielectric constants . to determine the appropriate value of the luttinger parameter for these tubes , we need to specify @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> the length , @xmath36 , of the tubes of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was typically @xmath85 ( a number equal to the mean free path @xcite ) and so we take @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a luttinger parameter of @xmath87 for the tubes suspended in air and @xmath88 for the tubes printed onto the silicon substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller @xmath1 for the suspended tubes indicates the action of a considerably stronger effective coulomb interactions for the tubes in this configuration .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the single photon excitons , @xmath81 , were measured for a set of 13 tubes with diameters between 0.78 nm and 1.18 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the tubes were embedded in a polymaleic acid / octyl vinyl ether ( pmaove ) matrix with an effective dielectric constant of @xmath30=2.5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the excitons were measured using two photon spectroscopy  thus the @xmath89 photons were also studied in this work but will not be considered here . as the length of tubes in the pmaove matrix was reported to be @xmath90 nm @xcite , far smaller than @xmath91 , we take @xmath92 here . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a luttinger parameter of @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the logarithmic dependence of @xmath1 upon @xmath84 , @xmath1 is relatively insensitive to @xmath94 changes of @xmath84 .    as an ingredient to our analysis of the data in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we need to determine the bare value of the gap , @xmath53 , for each tube . </S>",
    "<S> we do so with a tight binding model based on wrapping a honeycomb lattice of nearest neighbor spacing @xmath95a@xmath96 and hopping parameter @xmath97ev . </S>",
    "<S> we do not attempt to include curvature , twist , or stress corrections to @xmath53 ( @xcite ) although for small radius tubes such corrections may not be insignificant . </S>",
    "<S> but to be able to do so would require detailed characterization of the tubes in their environment which is not available . </S>",
    "<S> as we have explained the treatment has one fitting parameter : the constant @xmath60 governing the relationship between the effective bandwidth of the nanotube and the tube s diameter , @xmath98 . to find this constant @xmath60 we focus on the four @xmath81 excitonic gaps reported in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on these gaps because for these the correction due to finite bandwidth ( the second term in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> [ scaling ] ) can safely be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> when we fit eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cutoff ] ) we find @xmath99 </S>",
    "<S> . we will henceforth use this value for b to determine theoretical values of the gaps for all the other single photon excitons reported in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably this relationship between the bandwidth and the tube s diameter leads to excellent values for the other excitonic gaps considered in this study . to demonstrate this we first consider all ( 16 ) of the gaps reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the gaps are presented in table 1 of ref . @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the agreement between the theoretically predicted values of the gaps and the corresponding experimentally measured values is less than @xmath100 for the @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath48 , and one of the @xmath79 gaps and on the order of @xmath101 for the remaining @xmath79 gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively good agreement found for the @xmath79 and @xmath48 gaps is a result of taking into account the finite bandwidth corrections coming from the subleading term in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scaling ] ) where the corrections for @xmath79 and @xmath48 are large ( @xmath102 mev  see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scaling ] ) , inasmuch as they are proportional to @xmath103 , depend in turn upon our identification of @xmath52 with the tube diameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is an important consistency check for this ansatz in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cutoff ] ) that the computed corrections lead to a good match between the experiment and theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we find similar good agreement in our theoretical analysis of the @xmath81 excitons reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . using the same relationship of the bandwidth </S>",
    "<S> , we plot our predicted values for @xmath81 against those measured in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that only for the three smallest radius tubes do we not obtain excellent agreement between theory and experiment ( as explained earlier a likely consequence of missing curvature , strain , and twist effects on the bare gap , @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the same value of @xmath60 derived from the four @xmath81 large radius tube gaps in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite leads to an accurate prediction of the gaps for the smaller radius tubes in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * excitonic binding energies : * we finally consider the excitonic binding energies of the @xmath81 excitons reported in refs . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a the excitonic binding energies as a function of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energies are presented as a fraction of the exciton gap . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for @xmath75 large , the binding energies can be many multiples of the excitonic gap itself . as @xmath75 decreases , the fractional exciton binding energy decreases linearly in line with the linear decrease of @xmath42 ( as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b we plot the excitonic binding energies for the @xmath81 excitons . given that @xmath104 for these gaps </S>",
    "<S> , we see that from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a the binding energies roughly equal the gaps , @xmath81 , themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates of the binding energies for the @xmath81 excitons of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are considerably larger than those in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a consequence of our much larger estimate here of the renormalized band gaps . </S>",
    "<S> it would thus be of considerable interest if these band gaps could be measured directly . </S>",
    "<S> but this is a difficult task as the standard method for measuring the particle - hole continuum , scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , involves placing the tubes on a metallic substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the consequent screening of the coulomb interaction leads to values of @xmath1 near to 1 , far away from values of @xmath1 appropriate for the excitons measured in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a quantum field theoretical formalism able to predict the absolute magnitudes of optically active excitons in semi - conducting carbon nanotubes over a wide range of diameters , subbands , and dielectric environments . </S>",
    "<S> this method involves a single fitting parameter , @xmath60 , relating the effective bandwidth of the tube to the tube s diameter . </S>",
    "<S> once this parameter is in hand , a simple scaling function yields the excitonic gaps for arbitrary nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the predictions of this formalism with the excitonic data of refs . @xcite and have found good agreement . </S>"
