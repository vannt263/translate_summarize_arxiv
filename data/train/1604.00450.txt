    "bi - isotropic media , which include isotropic chiral media and tellegen media as special cases , are the most general form of linear isotropic media , where the electric displacement @xmath2 and the magnetic induction @xmath3 are related to both the electric field @xmath4 and the magnetic intensity @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the unusual constitutive relations of these media are the consequences of the magnetoelectric ( me ) effects occurring in me materials or me metamaterials , which are due to the coupling between electric polarization and magnetization @xcite . in those materials , an electric field can induce magnetization and a magnetic field can induce electric polarization .",
    "the study of me materials has a long history going back to the works of curie , debye , landau and lifshitz , dzyaloshinskii , and astrov @xcite .",

    "the bi - isotropic medium is the name given to a magnetoelectric material , when one is especially interested in the properties associated with electromagnetic wave propagation .",
    "two different kinds of bi - isotropic media , which have distinct ways of magnetoelectric coupling , have been studied in detail .",
    "the more extensively studied case is that of isotropic chiral media , in which the mirror symmetry is broken @xcite .",

    ", a large amount of attention has been given to chiral metamaterials with a strong chirality @xcite and to topological insulators @xcite .",

    "spatially uniform bi - isotropic media , right - circularly - polarized ( rcp ) and left - circularly - polarized ( lcp ) waves are the eigenmodes of propagation @xcite . in isotropic",
    "chiral media , the effective refractive indices associated with rcp and lcp waves are different , whereas the impedance is independent of the helicity .",
    "this gives rise to circular birefringence phenomena .",
    "in isotropic chiral media with a non - uniform impedance distribution , rcp and lcp waves are no longer eigenmodes and are coupled to each other .",
    "in contrast , in tellegen media , the effective impedances associated with rcp and lcp waves are different , whereas the effective refractive index is the same for both waves . again , these waves are coupled to each other in spatially non - uniform media .    in order to investigate the wave propagation characteristics in inhomogeneous bi - isotropic media ,",
    "it is necessary to have a theoretical method to analyze the propagation of two coupled waves in such media .",
    "a generalized version of the invariant imbedding method @xcite , which can analyze the propagation of any number of coupled waves in arbitrarily inhomogeneous stratified media accurately and efficiently , has been developed in @xcite and applied to isotropic chiral media @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we generalize this method further to more general situations and use it to study wave propagation in stratified bi - isotropic media .",

    "the main aim of these examples is not to give an extensive analysis of these phenomena , but to verify the validity of our invariant imbedding method and to demonstrate its usefulness and efficiency .    in section [ sec2 ] , we derive the coupled wave equations in stratified bi - isotropic media . in section [ sec3 ] and",
    "appendix a , we describe the invariant imbedding method used in this paper and derive the invariant imbedding equations . in section [ sec4 ] , we elaborate on the expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients and demonstrate that in lossless cases , the energy conservation law is properly obeyed . in section [ sec5 ] , we show the results of numerical calculations for a uniform chiral slab , the surface wave excitation at the interface between a tellegen medium and a metal and the mode conversion occurring in inhomogeneous tellegen media . finally , in section [ sec6 ] , we give a summary of the paper .",
