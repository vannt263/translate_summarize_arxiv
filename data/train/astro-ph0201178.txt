    "although dwarf galaxies are the most numerous extragalactic objects in the nearby universe ( e.g. , ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ; mateo 1998 ) , it seems unclear how they are related in origin to typical large ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) galaxies .",
    "dwarf galaxies could be formed through the same formation mechanism as that of large galaxies ; e.g. , gravitational collapse of protogalactic gas clouds ( dekel & silk 1986 ; white & frenk 1991 ; frenk et al . 1996 ; kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ) . however ,",
    "it is known that dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) apparently belong to a different class from normal large ellipticals ( es ) in the fundamental plane ( e.g. , kormendy 1985 ) , suggesting that the formation and/or evolution processes of dwarfs may not always be the same as those of larger ellipticals .    it has been argued from an observational view point that dwarf galaxies may be formed by galaxy collisions because there appears to be morphological evidence for dwarf galaxies in the tidal tails of interacting galaxies ( zwicky 1956 ; schweizer 1978 ; duc et al .",
    "2000 ) ; i.e. , gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxies , can be made out of stellar and gaseous material pulled out into intergalactic space by tidal forces from the disks of colliding parent galaxies .",
    "this possibility has been recently reinforced by a number of pieces of observational evidence ( schweizer 1982 ; bergvall & johansson 1985 ; schombert , wallin & struck - marcell 1990 ; mirabel , lutz & maza 1991 ; mirabel , dottori & lutz 1992 ; duc & mirabel 1994 , 1998 ; duc et al .",
    "2000 ; yoshida , taniguchi & murayama 1994 ; braine et al .",
    "2000 ; weilbacher et al .",
    "also , hunsberger et al . ( 1996 ; 1998 ) find an excess of dwarf galaxies in compact groups of galaxies apparently caused by interactions among group members .",
    "such formation of tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) has also been demonstrated by numerical simulations of merging / interacting galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ; elmegreen , kaufman & thomasson 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , tidal formation seems to potentially be an important formation mechanism for dwarf galaxies ( okazaki & taniguchi 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "one famous tidal debris system extends to the northeast of seyfert s sextet ( hereafter ss ) .",
    "ss is one of the most famous , as well as densest , compact groups of galaxies ( seyfert 1948a , 1948b ; see for a review , rabaa 1996 ) .",
    "this group is also a hickson compact group ( hereafter hcg ) of galaxies , hcg 79 ( hickson 1982 ; 1993 ) .",
    "many subsequent studies of ss have mentioned that the galaxies in ss appear to show morphologically and dynamically peculiar properties ( sulentic & lorre 1983 ; rubin , hunter , & ford 1991 ; bettoni & fasano 1993 ; mendes de oliveira & hickson 1994 ; bonfanti et al .",
    "1999 ; nishiura et al .",
    "hickson himself regarded ss as a galaxy quartet ( hcg 79a , 79b , 79c , and 79d ) .",
    "a fifth component , hcg 79e , was found to be a redshift - discordant galaxy that is believed to have no physical relation to ss ( hickson 1992 ) . a sixth object , or more precisely the north - eastern optical fuzz , is now considered likely to be tidal debris associated with the morphologically peculiar galaxy hcg 79b ( rubin et al .",
    "1991 ; williams et al . 1991 ; mendes de oliveira & hickson 1994 ; vlchez & iglesias - pramo 1998 ) .    current x - ray observations",
    "are not sensitive enough to detect any x - ray emission that may originate from intragroup gas that might be present in ss ( pildis , bregman , & evrard 1995 ; ponman et al .",
    ". however , sulentic & lorre ( 1983 ) and nishiura et al .",
    "( 2000b ) detected a faint optical envelope around ss that is plausibly composed of stars tidally liberated from the galaxies in ss , plus williams , mcmahon & van gorkom ( 1991 ) found extended hi emission .",
    "these observations suggest that ss is a physically real compact group .    in this paper , we present results of our photometric study of tdss . since this tidal debris system in ss ( hereafter tdss )",
    "is morphologically similar to other tidal debris , such as arp 105s and arp 245n ( braine et al . 2000 ) , we will also compare the photometric properties of tdss with these two tidal debris . throughout this paper",

    ", we show our optical @xmath84 image together with the hi intensity map taken from williams et al .",
    "the hi emission appears associated with tdss and distributed in an ellipse whose semi - major and semi - minor axes are 15@xmath270 and 10@xmath270 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the hi column density within this ellipse is constant at a value of @xmath82 h @xmath83 , we roughly estimate that the hi gas mass associated with tdss is @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we obtain a ratio of the hi gas mass to optical @xmath86band luminosity of @xmath87 for tdss .",
    "this value is much smaller than those of arp 105s ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) and arp 245n ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) .",
    "furthermore , vlchez & iglesias - pramo ( 1998 ) detect no h@xmath94 emission in tdss .",
    "this suggests the poverty of very massive stars in tdss .",
    "these observations suggest that only a small amount of gas was involved in the formation of tdss .",
    "bettoni & fasano ( 1993 ) and bonfanti et al . ( 1999 ) mentioned another possibility ; i.e. , tdss ( called `` hcg 79b1 '' in their papers ) is a pre - existing galaxy falling into ss that is being destroyed by galaxy - galaxy interaction . since the photometric properties of tdss are similar to those of des ( i.e. , b - v colors and exponential surface brightness profiles ) , their idea may remain as a possible one . however , from the metallicity of tdss , as determined from the sed , we suggest that tdss is a tidally - induced object consisting primarily of stars liberated from hcg 79b",
    ". further investigation of the mass - to - luminosity ratio and/or a more detailed investigation of the metallicity would be useful to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "it also requires numerical simulations to make sure whether tidally object being made by galaxy interactions without secondary star formation .",
    "from multi - band photometry of the prominent tidal debris feature to the northeast of seyfert s sextet we have obtained the following results :    1 .",
    "the surface brightness profile of this tidal debris in seyfert s sextet ( tdss ) in each band shows an approximately exponential profile .",
    "2 .   the observed @xmath9 color of tdss is redder than those of tidal dwarf galaxies , e.g. , arp 105s and arp 245n ( braine et al . 2000 ) .",
    "3 .   comparing the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of tdss with theoretical photometric evolution models",
    ", we find that its sed is comparable to that of a stellar population with age @xmath10 10 gyr and with higher metallicity than the average values found in tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "4 .   comparing seds , we find that the sed of tdss is similar to that of the stars in the outer part of hcg 79b",
    "tdss seems to consist primarily of stars liberated from hcg 79b by strong galaxy interaction .",
    "we conclude that tdss is simply a passive tidal feature like many others in interacting galaxy systems .",
    "we also conclude that there is no indication that tdss will evolve into a star - forming tidal dwarf galaxy similar to those previously studied .",
    "this , however , indicates that another type of forming dwarf galaxy without secondary star formation through the galaxy interaction .",
