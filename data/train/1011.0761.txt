    "studies of topological aspects have been attracting a great deal of attention in lattice qcd .",
    "issues here include whether the index theorem relating gauge field topology and fermionic zero modes is well defined .",
    "lattice fermion actions without doublers do illustrate the index theorem nicely .",
    "for example , one old - fashioned way to study topology in qcd is to use wilson fermion @xcite , although it requires fine - tuning of a mass parameter because of explicit breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the overlap fermion @xcite , which is built on the wilson fermion kernel , resolves this problem since it possesses both exact chiral symmetry and exact zero modes related to gauge field topology , agreeing with the index theorem @xcite . the domain wall formalism @xcite , closely related to the overlap fermion , is also a useful tool to study topological effects in qcd . on the other hand ,",
    "the index is hidden in lattice fermions with species doublers since the index effect cancels between doubling pairs .",
    "although a theoretical approach to the index of the staggered fermions @xcite were developed in @xcite , it does not give an integer value from the beginning and requires a renormalization depending on the full ensemble of the gauge fields .",
    "thus it is not easy to define the index theorem in naive , staggered and minimally - doubled fermions and thereby study topological effects .    ref .",
    "@xcite recently presented how to identify the would - be zero modes and their chiralities with staggered fermions away from the continuum limit using the spectral flow of a certain hermitean version of the dirac operator .",
    "the integer index obtained here correctly illustrates the gauge topological charge up to a factor coming from tastes . in a sequent paper @xcite",
    ", the author presents a new version of the overlap fermion , the `` staggered overlap fermion '' constructed from the staggered kernel .",
    "it is a two - flavor overlap fermion in four dimensions and the associated index of exact zero modes illustrates the gauge field topology correctly again . in ref .",
    "@xcite the possibility to construct a single - flavor version of the staggered overlap fermion is also discussed .",
    "the key for theoretical foundation of the index theorem and the sequent overlap formalism here is to introduce a taste sensitive mass which is essential to reveal the hidden index with the spectral flow of the hermitean operator . the new mass term , which assigns positive and negative masses to tastes depending on their flavor - chiralities , removes the cancellation of the index between tastes . when the staggered kernel with this kind of mass is substituted into the overlap formalism , some tastes with positive mass decouple while other tastes with negative mass yield massless modes , which correspond to the two - flavor staggered overlap fermion .",
    "it is a universal feature for fermions with species doublers that you can obtain the associated overlap fermion with a proper flavored mass term illustrating the correct index .",
    "one natural extension of this approach is to apply it to the naive lattice fermion . as is well - known",
    ", the naive fermion includes 16 species while staggered has 4 species in four dimension thus it is expected we can take a parallel process to establish the integer index theorem without renormalization and construct overlap fermion with the naive kernel . however one obstacle in this case is the individual species appear most easily only in momentum space , which leads to difficulty of identifying them as flavors and introducing flavored mass terms .",
    "we have a similar problem with minimally doubled fermions @xcite , where there are two species in momentum space .",
    "so far there has been no theoretical foundation of the index theorem for naive and minimally doubled fermions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we successfully identify species in naive and minimally doubled fermions as flavors by using the point splitting method , which is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to define up and down quark fields in minimally doubled fermions . by this identification ,",
    "we define proper flavored mass terms to extract the index in the spectral flow of the associated hermitean version of the dirac operator . here",
    "we follow a parallel approach for identifying the would - be zero modes and their chiralities to that proposed in the staggered case @xcite .",
    "then we find the spectral flow correctly illustrates the index determined by the gauge field topology in naive and minimally doubled fermions . in addition",
    "we present new versions of overlap fermions built from the naive fermion kernel with added flavored mass terms . especially we construct a single - flavor naive overlap fermion by choosing a certain flavored mass which assigns negative mass to one and positive mass to all other species . one good property of this fermion over the minimally doubled case is it maintains hypercubic symmetry .",
    "furthermore it appears to have more stability of the index against disorder than the wilson overlap fermion .",
    "thus this overlap fermion might be more suitable for practical simulations .",
    "with the @xmath0-dimensional naive lattice fermion there are @xmath1 species and the associated massless dirac operator is anti - hermitean .",
    "these properties are common with the staggered fermion except that there are only @xmath2 tastes in the latter case .",
    "thus it seems easy to apply the approach for the index of staggered fermion @xcite to the naive fermion . in this spectral - flow approach",
    "the flavored mass term is essential , which gives @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses to flavors(species ) depending on their chiral charges .",
    "however the species in the naive fermion appear naturally only in momentum space .",
    "therefore in this case we can not implement flavored mass terms straightforwardly since we need to identify species in momentum space as independent flavors . to resolve this problem",
    "we apply a method called `` point splitting , '' originally proposed to define up and down quark fields in minimally doubled fermion @xcite . by using this method we obtain flavored mass terms to give proper hermitean operators for the spectral flow both in minimally doubled and naive fermions . in this section",
    "we first introduce the point splitting for minimally doubled fermions and implement flavored mass terms .",
    "secondly we perform the parallel approach for naive fermions .      here",
    "we introduce the point splitting method to obtain flavored mass terms in minimally doubled fermions .",
    "we focus only on the karsten - wilczek type @xcite all through this paper .",
    "now we begin with the introduction of minimally doubled fermions .",
    "the @xmath5 karsten - wilczek action is obtained by introducing a wilson - like term proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "its position - space expression is @xmath7\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the link variables satisfy @xmath8 . for the free theory ,",
    "the associated dirac operator in momentum space is given by @xmath9 where the parameter @xmath10 adjusts the relative positions of zeros .",
    "it has only two zeros located at @xmath11 .",
    "these two species are not equivalent since the gamma matrices are differently defined between them as @xmath12 . in the above case",
    "the transformation matrix is given by @xmath13 .",
    "this means the chiral symmetry possessed by this action is identified as a flavored one given by @xmath14 .",
    "the point splitting identifies these inequivalent species as independent flavors . in this method",
    "each flavor field is defined so that the associated propagator includes only a single pole .",
    "thus we point - split the original fermion field by multiplying factors removing another undesired pole in momentum space , @xmath15 @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 fields correspond to the poles at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we remark both of them yield single fermionic modes and the associated point - split fields in position space are composed of the original field and the two kinds of nearest neighbors @xcite . with these flavor fields",
    "we obtain a flavor - multiplet field as following , @xmath21 here @xmath22 multiplication on the original dirac field is identified as @xmath23 here we introduce a multiplet representation as a direct product of the pauli matrix to express the 2-flavor structure .",
    "it means the flavored chiral symmetry generated by @xmath14 is exactly preserved in terms of the flavor multiplet while the flavor singlet chiral symmetry given by @xmath24 is broken in higher order terms .",
    "it is also the case of the staggered fermion @xcite .",
    "now we can introduce a flavor breaking mass into minimally doubled fermions by a parallel approach to the case of staggered fermions in refs .",
    "we have to choose a flavored mass term so that it reveals the hidden index when looking into the spectral flow of a certain hermitean version of the dirac operator @xmath25 , which we will explain in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : sp ] .",
    "( this @xmath22 is regarded as @xmath14 in terms of the flavor multiplet as shown in ( [ gamma5_md ] ) . )",
    "we need to impose that @xmath26 should be flavor - singlet as @xmath27 .",
    "thus the corresponding flavored mass term here is @xmath28 with a mass parameter @xmath29 . to implement this flavored mass term into the action",
    ", we rewrite the mass term with the original dirac field as @xmath30 it is straightforward to obtain the mass term in the position space with the link variables present , @xmath31 here we also write a flavor - singlet mass term @xmath32 which is not required for the study of the index . the associated massive dirac operator @xmath33 is non - hermitean , and when gauge fields are present the mass term does not commute with the kinetic term @xmath34\\not=0 $ ] . thus the dirac operator eigenvalues are complex .",
    "indeed it is essential for the purpose to detect the index from the spectral flow of the hermitean operator since it relies on real eigenvalues of the dirac operator .    in fig .",
    "[ dirac_ev_kw ] we show a numerical result of complex eigenvalues of the dirac operator for the @xmath35 free case with a parameter @xmath36 . here",
    "the low - lying spectrum is split into two branches crossing the real axis at the magnitude of the mass parameter @xmath37 .",
    "it means that the flavored mass @xmath38 assigns @xmath39(@xmath40 ) to modes depending on @xmath41(@xmath42 ) chiral charges , or equivalently @xmath41(@xmath42 ) eigenvalues for @xmath43 . in other words",
    "the flavored mass term splits the minimally doubled fermion into two single dirac fermions with @xmath39 and @xmath40 as in the staggered case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sp ] we will see this flavored mass gives the spectral flow of the hermitean operator illustrating the correct index related to the gauge topology .",
    "we can apply the same approach to the naive lattice fermion @xcite to obtain a proper flavored mass term .",
    "the action of the naive fermions in general dimensions is simply given by @xmath46 for simplicity here we consider the @xmath35 naive fermions .",
    "the dirac operator has four zeros @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in momentum space , thus we introduce four associated point - split fields @xmath51 whose locations of zeros , chiral charges and transformation matrices @xmath52 giving the corresponding set of gamma matrices , @xmath53 , are listed in table [ gammas_naive2d ] .",
    "the flavor - multiplet field is given by @xmath54         we introduce a flavor multiplet field with 16 components as @xmath58 then 16 flavored mass terms are given by @xmath59 where we introduce a multiplet representation as four direct products of the pauli matrix to express the 16 flavor structure . in this representation",
    "the chiral transformation matrix @xmath60 is converted to @xmath61 , under which the naive action is invariant .",
    "here the v - type includes 4 varieties while the t - type has 6 varieties and the a - type 4 varieties , giving then the total number as 16 .",
    "each of these varieties breaks the hypercubic symmetry of the lattice since their hoppings are anisotropic .",
    "thus we need to take a proper combination of them in order to construct a flavored mass term with hypercubic symmetry .",
    "for example we consider the sum of the 4 varieties with the same ratios for the v - type as in the case of @xmath35 .",
    "it is also the case with the t- and a - types .",
    "thus the 5 types of flavored masses with the symmetry in terms of the original fermion field are given by @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 means summation over permutations of the space - time indices .",
    "free field case in momentum space with @xmath68 grids of the brillouin zone .",

    "( b ) @xmath70 .",
    "( c ) @xmath71.,title=\"fig : \" ]   free field case in momentum space with @xmath68 grids of the brillouin zone . ( a ) @xmath69 .",

    "( c ) @xmath71.,title=\"fig : \" ]    now we derive the flavored mass terms required to detect the index from the spectral flow of the hermitean operator . as in the @xmath35 case , it should be constructed so that the associated hermitean operator has a flavor - singlet mass part as @xmath72 .",
    "such a mass term is just the p - type mass ( [ p - mass ] ) .",
    "thus the flavored mass term for the hermitean operator is given by @xmath73 with the hermitean operator @xmath74 , we reveal the index theorem with the naive fermion as in the @xmath35 case . here",
    "we only show the figure for eigenvalues of the free dirac operator @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ dirac_ev_n4d](a ) .",
    "the mass term splits the modes into two branches , which are 8 fold degenerate .",
    "if we introduce other types of mass terms , the degeneracy is lifted as seen in fig .",
    "[ dirac_ev_n4d](b ) .",
    "next we show the flavored mass term to yield a single - flavor naive overlap fermion in @xmath76d . as in the case of @xmath77d",
    "there are some possibilities to realize it .",
    "the simplest example of the mass term to yield a single - flavor naive overlap fermion with hypercubic symmetry is given by @xmath78 the eigenvalues of the dirac operator with this mass term is depicted in fig .  [",
    "dirac_ev_n4d](c ) . here",
    "the negative branch is single and the positive one is 15 fold degenerate .",
    "it means the associated overlap fermion produces only one massless mode .",
    "furthermore , as seen from the construction , it should possess hypercubic symmetry .",
    "thus it could be a useful fermion action for lattice qcd simulation .",
    "we now comment on some connections with other works .",
    "the p - type mass term actually corresponds to the modified gamma matrix @xmath79 , which is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the effects of topological charge with the @xmath76d naive fermion .",
    "in some sense we have given its theoretical foundation by the point - splitting method .",
    "it is also similar to @xmath80 of the staggered fermions @xcite . regarding the t - type masses",
    ", they are similar to the flavored mass terms for the single - flavor staggered overlap fermion proposed in @xcite .",
    "these similarities are reasonable since the staggered fermions can be obtained from the naive fermions @xcite .",
