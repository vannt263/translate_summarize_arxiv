    "ladder climbing ( lc ) is understood as an approach to a robust excitation of quantum systems by the means of chirped quasiperiodic modulation of system parameters .",
    "such modulation , or drive , induces successive landau - zener ( lz ) transitions  @xcite between neighboring energy levels when the corresponding transition frequency is in resonance with the drive .",
    "as the modulation is chirped , transitions are induced in different pairs of levels at different times . then it becomes possible to robustly propel quanta across a wide range of the energy spectrum , provided that the chirp rate is slow enough and the drive is sufficiently strong .    by now",
    ", lc has been demonstrated in various quantum systems ranging from atoms and molecules  @xcite , to anharmonic oscillators  @xcite , josephson resonator  @xcite , and bouncing neutrons  @xcite . in the limit of continuous spectrum",
    ", the drive couples many levels simultaneously and the quantum lc become the well known classical autoresonance ( ar )  @xcite .",
    "most recently , it was also proposed that the effect is extendable to classical systems  @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was shown in ref .",
    "that langmuir waves in bounded plasma may undergo lc much like a quantum system , if the background plasma density is subjected to a low - frequency chirped modulation ( e.g. , a chirped acoustic wave ) .",
    "however , the theory in ref .   relies on a linear fluid model , so it neglects kinetic effects , such as landau damping , and nonlinear effects , such as particle trapping .",
    "whether lc by electron plasma waves can survive these effects and can be practiced on realistic waves remains to be shown _",
    "ab  initio_.    the purpose of this paper is to present first _",
    "ab  initio _ collisionless simulations confirming that lc of electron plasma waves is a robust effect that can survive kinetic and nonlinear effects .",
    "the simulations are done using a one - dimensional vlasov - poisson code .",
    "we find that , at sufficiently low mode numbers numbers @xmath0 , lc proceeds much like anticipated from the simplified fluid theory  @xcite . at larger @xmath0 ,",
    "landau damping and nonlinear effects eventually disrupt the process . that said , we also find that nonlinear effects facilitate lc in the sense that they reduce landau damping and thus help plasmons reach @xmath0 larger than those expected from the linear theory .",
    "in other words , lc is even more efficient when practiced on quasiperiodic bernstein - greene - kruskal ( bgk ) modes  @xcite rather than on linear waves _ per  se_.",
    "the lc phenomenon practiced upon plasma waves is certainly of academic interest , because the langmuir wave is probably the most fundamental and widely occurring mode in plasma physics .",
    "however , manipulating its properties through ladder climbing could be of interest in practical applications as well .",
    "certain applications exploit the small group velocity of the langmuir wave , such as plasma holography  @xcite , plasma photonic crystals  @xcite , and other cooperative plasma phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the plasma wave is also useful in mediating the compression of laser energy in plasmas , thereby to reach ultra - high intensities  @xcite . in that regard ,",
    "the ability of the plasma wave to linger in plasma owing to its small group velocity makes it a useful seed for this interaction  @xcite . in each of these cases , while the plasma wave is lingering , but before performing a task , such as , retrieving information or mediating laser compression , it can be imagined that it might be usefully manipulated to better perform that task .",
    "the lc described here would be one tool to perform those manipulations or optimizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conc ] , we present our main conclusions .",
    "consider a one - dimensional collisionless nonmagnetized plasma with immobile ions that form a static homogeneous background .",
    "as known commonly from fluid theory  @xcite , such plasma supports electrostatic electron waves , called langmuir waves , whose frequency @xmath1 for a given wave number @xmath2 is given by @xmath3^{1/2}$ ] . here , @xmath4 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath5 is the debye length , @xmath6 is the unperturbed electron density , @xmath7 is the elementary charge , @xmath8 is the electron mass , @xmath9 is the electron thermal velocity , and @xmath10 is the electron temperature .    assuming hard - wall boundary conditions , the allowed wave numbers are @xmath11 , where @xmath0 is the mode number , @xmath12 is the wave number of the fundamental mode , and @xmath13 is the plasma length .",
    "the discrete dispersion relation of a standing langmuir wave can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath16 can be understood as a measure of the spectrum anharmonicity , i.e. , of how strongly the frequency difference of neighboring modes @xmath17 depends on @xmath0 . for @xmath18",
    ", one has @xmath19 as any collection of discrete modes , such system is mathematically equivalent to a quantum particle governed by a hamiltonian with the same spectrum  @xcite .",
    "thus , linear langmuir waves in bounded fluid plasma can be described by lc theory borrowed from quantum mechanics , in which the system is propelled from an initial mode ( e.g. , the lowest - order mode , or `` ground state '' ) up to a desired final mode  @xcite .",
    "lc can be realized by applying an external drive or a density modulation  @xcite , with a chirped frequency @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the starting frequency , @xmath22 is a constant chirping rate , and @xmath23 is time .    following the quantum lc theory , we identify two dimensionless parameters of interest : the driving parameter @xmath24 and the anharmonicity parameter @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the modulation amplitude ( namely , the relative perturbation of the background electron density ) and @xmath27 is the dimensionless chirping rate . the probability of the plasmon transfer between neighboring modes is given by @xmath28  @xcite . in order to have efficient lc , @xmath29 must be large enough .",
    "for example , @xmath30 results in energy transfer above 97% to the next mode .",
    "in addition , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omm ] ) , one has @xmath31 .",
    "this means that the time interval between successive resonances ( `` transition time '' ) is @xmath32 . using the  natural \" dimensionless time @xmath33 , the transition time is given by @xmath34 . for lc ,",
    "@xmath35 must be satisfied so that the lz transitions are well separated and only two levels are coupled at a given time . in the other limit , where @xmath36 , many levels are simultaneously coupled and the system exhibits ar acceleration , which is the continuum limit of lc . also note that @xmath37 ( adiabaticity condition ) is needed for this theory to hold .",
    "otherwise , the mode coupling induced by the drive is nonresonant , so the transfer of quanta becomes phase - dependent ( nonadiabatic ) .",
    "this theory of lc and ar by langmuir waves was proposed in ref .  , and it was also confirmed there numerically using linear fluid simulations .",
    "although the linear landau damping was recognized as a kinetic limit on the accessibility of levels with high @xmath0 , the kinetic stability of lower levels and the phase space evolution during the damping were not studied . in order to explore how lc is modified when kinetic and nonlinear effects are involved , more rigorous simulations are needed .",
    "we report such simulations below .",
    "the transition to the ar is not considered because of numerical limitations .",

    "we adopt the reflecting - wall conditions in @xmath39 space ; i.e. , @xmath41 at the plasma boundaries @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the dynamics of @xmath38 is governed by the vlasov equation @xmath44 where the electric field is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the self - induced field , @xmath47 is the field that drives lc , and the  preparation \" field @xmath48 is used to set up the initial langmuir wave .",

    "we assume that the plasma is overall neutral [ @xmath54 and the surface charges at the walls are zero , so the boundary conditions for the electric field are @xmath55 .    in this paper , we investigate the lc dynamics that begins the `` ground level '' ; namely , the initial wave is prepared using @xmath48 that is resonant with the lowest mode ( @xmath56 ) .",
