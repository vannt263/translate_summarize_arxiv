    "in recent years , casimir forces arising from quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field  @xcite have become the focus of intense theoretical and experimental effort  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been verified via many experiments  @xcite , most commonly in simple , one - dimensional geometries involving parallel plates or approximations thereof , with some exceptions  @xcite .",
    "a particular topic of interest is the geometry and material dependence of the force , a subject that has only recently begun to be addressed in experiments  @xcite and by promising new theoretical methods  @xcite .",
    "for example , recent works have shown that it is possible to find unusual effects arising from many - body interactions or from systems exhibiting strongly coupled material and geometric dispersion  @xcite .",
    "these numerical studies have been mainly focused in two - dimensional  @xcite or simple three - dimensional constant - cross - section geometries  @xcite for which numerical calculations are tractable .    in this manuscript , we present a simple and general method to compute casimir forces in arbitrary geometries and for arbitrary materials that is based on a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) scheme in which maxwell s equations are evolved in time  @xcite .",
    "a time - domain approach offers a number of advantages over previous methods .",
    "first , and foremost , it enables researchers to exploit powerful free and commercial fdtd software with no modification .",
    "the generality of many available fdtd solvers provides yet another means to explore the material and geometry dependence of the force , including calculations involving anisotropic dielectrics  @xcite and/or three - dimensional problems .",
    "second , this formulation also offers a fundamentally different viewpoint on casimir phenomena , and thus new opportunities for the theoretical and numerical understanding of the force in complex geometries .",
    "our time - domain method is based on a standard formulation in which the casimir force is expressed as a contour integral of the frequency - domain stress tensor  @xcite . like most other methods for casimir calculations ,",
    "the stress tensor method typically involves evaluation at imaginary frequencies , which we show to be unsuitable for fdtd .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by exploiting a recently - developed exact equivalence between the system for which we wish to compute the casimir force and a transformed problem in which all material properties are modified to include dissipation  @xcite . to illustrate this approach , we consider a simple choice of contour , corresponding to a conductive medium , that leads to a simple and efficient time - domain implementation . finally , using a free , widely - available fdtd code  @xcite , we compute the force between two vacuum - separated perfectly - metallic plates , a geometry that is amenable to analytical calculations and which we use to analyze various important features of our method .",
    "an illustration of the power and flexibility of this method will be provided in a subsequent article  @xcite , currently in preparation , in which we will demonstrate computations of the force in a number of non - trivial ( dispersive , three - dimensional ) geometries as well as further refinements to the method .",
    "in what follows , we derive a numerical method to compute the casimir force on a body using the fdtd method .",
    "the basic steps involved in computing the force are :    * map the problem exactly onto a new problem with dissipation given by a frequency - independent conductivity @xmath0 .",
    "* measure the electric @xmath1 and magnetic @xmath2 fields in response to current pulses placed separately at each point along a surface enclosing the body of interest . *",
    "integrate these fields in space over the enclosing surface and then integrate this result , multiplied by a known function @xmath3 , over time @xmath4 , via  eq .",

    "we describe the mathematical development of our time - domain computational method , starting from a standard formulation in which the casimir force is expressed as a contour integral of the frequency - domain stress tensor .",
    "we consider the frequency domain for derivation purposes only , since the final technique outlined above resides entirely in the time domain . in this framework ,",
    "computing the casimir force involves the repeated evaluation of the photon green s function @xmath5 over a surface @xmath6 surrounding the object of interest .",
    "our goal is then to compute @xmath5 via the fdtd method .",
    "the straightforward way to achieve this involves computing the fourier transform of the electric field in response to a short pulse .",
    "however , in most methods a crucial step for evaluating the resulting frequency integral is the passage to imaginary frequencies , corresponding to imaginary time .",
    "we show that , in the fdtd this , gives rise to exponentially growing solutions and is therefore unsuitable . instead",
    ", we describe an alternative formulation of the problem that exploits a recently proposed equivalence in which contour deformations in the complex frequency - domain @xmath7 correspond to introducing an effective dispersive , dissipative medium at a real `` frequency '' @xmath8 . from this perspective",
    ", it becomes simple to modify the fdtd maxwell s equations for the purpose of obtaining well - behaved stress tensor frequency integrands .",
    "we illustrate our approach by considering a contour corresponding to a medium with frequency - independent conductivity @xmath0 .",
    "this contour has the advantage of being easily implemented in the fdtd , and in fact is already incorporated in most fdtd solvers .",
    "finally , we show that it is possible to abandon the frequency domain entirely in favor of evaluating the force integral directly in the time domain , which offers several conceptual and numerical advantages .",

    "integrating along a frequency contour @xmath7 is therefore equivalent to making the medium dispersive in the form of eq .",

    "( [ eq : large - sigma ] ) , the eigenfrequency @xmath8 of a given spatial mode scales proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "the lowest - frequency mode therefore has a time - dependence @xmath133 , for some constant @xmath134 .",
    "since the decay of the force at long times is determined by this mode , we expect the decay time to scale inversely with @xmath0 in the limit of very high @xmath0 .",
    "this is suggested in  fig .",
    "[ fig : force-1d ] and confirmed by further numerical experiments .",
    "additionally , from  eq .  ( [ eq : large - sigma ] ) we see that in the case of a homogeneous one - dimensional cavity , the solutions have a quadratic dispersion @xmath135 , for spatial dependence @xmath136 , and so the lowest cavity frequency scales as the inverse square of the cavity size .",
    "this means that the rate of exponential convergence of  fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - plates ] should vary as @xmath137 in the limit of very large @xmath0 .",
    "this scaling is approximately apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - plates ] , and further experiments for much larger @xmath0 confirm the scaling .",
    "we thus see that in this limit , the effect of increasing @xmath0 by some factor is analogous to increasing the wall spacing of the cavity by the square root of that factor .",
    "the present analysis shows that there are two undesirable extremes .",
    "when @xmath0 is small , rapid oscillations in @xmath121 will lead to large numerical errors in more than one dimension .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , the resulting frequency shift will cause the cavity mode to decay more slowly , resulting in a longer run time .",
    "the optimal @xmath0 lies somewhere in between these two extremes and will generally depend on the system being studied . for the systems considered in this paper , with a typical scale @xmath138",
    ", @xmath139 appears to be a good value for efficient and stable time - domain computation .",
    "an algorithm to compute casimir forces in fdtd has several practical advantages .",
    "fdtd algorithms that solve maxwell s equations with frequency - independent conductivity , and even more complicated dispersions , are plentiful and well - studied .",
    "they are stable , convergent , and easily parallelized .",
    "although the current formulation of our method requires the evaluation of @xmath140 along a surface @xmath6 , requiring a separate calculation of the fields for each dipole source in @xmath6 , all of these sources can be simulated in parallel , with no communication between different simulations until the very end of the computation .",
    "in addition , many fdtd solvers will allow the computational cell for each source to be parallelized , providing a powerful method capable of performing large computations .",
    "the calculations of this paper employed non - dispersive materials in the original ( @xmath11 ) system . however , the theoretical analysis applies equally well to materials of arbitrary dispersion .",
    "any materials that can be implemented in an fdtd solver ( e.g. a sum of lorentzian dielectric resonances  @xcite ) can also be included , and existing algorithms have demonstrated the ability to model real materials  @xcite .",
    "existing fdtd implementations also handle anisotropy in @xmath43 and @xmath42 , multiple types of boundary conditions , and other complications  @xcite .    in principle , the computational scaling of this fdtd method is comparable to finite - difference frequency - domain ( fdfd ) methods  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "each solver step ( either a time step for fdtd or an iterative - solver step for fdfd ) requires @xmath141 work for @xmath142 grid points .",
    "the number of time steps required by an fdtd method is proportional to the diameter of the computational cell , or @xmath143 in @xmath144 dimensions . with an ideal multigrid solver , fdfd can in principle be solved by @xmath145 solver steps , but a simpler solver like conjugate gradient requires a number of steps proportional to the diameter as well  @xcite . in both cases , the number of points to be solver on the surface @xmath6 is @xmath146 .",
    "hence , the overall complexity of the simplest implementations ( not multigrid ) is @xmath147 .",
    "we believe that future boundary - element methods  @xcite will achieve better efficiency , but such methods require considerable effort to implement and their implementation is specific to the homogeneous - medium green s function , which depends on the boundary conditions , dimensionality and types of materials considered  @xcite .",
    "part  ii of this manuscript  @xcite , in preparation , will illustrate the method in various non - trivial two- and three - dimensional geometries , including dispersive dielectrics .",
    "in addition , we introduce an optimization of our method ( based on a rapidly converging series expansion of the fields ) that greatly speeds up the spatial integral of the stress tensor .",
    "we also compute forces in three - dimensional geometries with cylindrical symmetry , which allows us to take advantage of the cylindrical coordinates support in existing fdtd software  @xcite and employ a two - dimensional computational cell .",

    "fdtd algorithms approximate both time and space by a discrete uniform mesh .",
    "bearing aside the standard analysis of stability and convergence  @xcite , this discretization will slightly modify the analysis in the preceding sections .",
    "in particular , the use of a finite temporal grid ( resolution @xmath148 ) implies that all continuous time derivatives are now replaced by a finite - difference relation , which is most commonly taken to be a center difference : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is an arbitrary function of time .",
    "the effect of temporal discretization is therefore to replace the linear operator @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "the representation of this operator is simple to compute in the frequency domain .",
    "letting @xmath152 act on a fourier component of of @xmath150 yields : @xmath153 where @xmath154    the effect of discretization on the system is thus to replace @xmath155 by @xmath156 in the derivatives , which correspond to numerical dispersion arising from the ultraviolet ( nyquist ) frequency cutoff @xmath157 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is still the frequency parameter governing the time dependence of the fourier components of @xmath150 and @xmath158 in the limit of infinite resolution ( @xmath159 ) .    because fdtd is convergent [ @xmath160 ,",
    "most of the analysis can be done ( as in this paper ) in the @xmath161 limit .",

    "the basic principle is that one must be careful to use the discrete analogues to continuous solutions in cases where there is a divergence or regularization needed .",
    "this is the case for @xmath75 , but not for the jacobian .",
    "similarly , if one wished to subtract the vacuum green s function from the green s function , one needs to subtract the vacuum green s function as computed in the discretized vacuum .",
    "such a subtraction is unnecessary if the stress tensor is integrated over a closed surface ( vacuum contributions are constants that integrate to zero ) , but is useful in cases like the parallel plates considered here . by subtracting the ( discretized ) vacuum green s function , one can evaluate the stress tensor only for a single point between the plates , rather than for a `` closed surface '' with another point on the other side of the plates  @xcite .    as was noted before eq .",
    "( [ eq : gndt ] ) , the nyquist frequency @xmath157 regularizes the frequency integrations , similar to other ultraviolet regularization schemes employed in casimir force calculations  @xcite . because the total frequency integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) goes to zero for large @xmath8 ( due to cancellations occurring in the spatial integration and also due to the dissipation introduced in our approach ) , the precise nature of this regularization is irrelevant as long as @xmath148 is sufficiently small ( i.e. , at high enough resolution ) .",
    "one way to compute the magnetic correlation function is by taking spatial derivatives of the electric green s function by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hhg ] ) , but this is inefficient because a numerical derivative involves evaluating the electric green s function at multiple points . instead , we compute the magnetic green s function directly , finding the magnetic field in response to a magnetic current . this formulation , however , necessitates a change in the choice of vector potentials  eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ea][eq : ba ] ) as well as a switch from an electric to magnetic conductivity , for reasons explained in this section .    equations  ( [ eq : ea][eq : ba ] ) express the magnetic field @xmath168 as the curl of the vector potential @xmath169 , enforcing the constraint that @xmath168 is divergence - free ( no magnetic charge ) . however , this is no longer true when there is a magnetic current , as can be seen by taking the divergence of both sides of faraday s law with a magnetic current @xmath25 , @xmath170 , since @xmath171 for a point - dipole current @xmath25 . instead ,",
