    "the theories we will consider have minimal structure . we assume a physical state space @xmath0 and a set of allowed physical operations @xmath1 from @xmath2 that is closed under composition . for quantum mechanics , @xmath0 will be the set of density matrices and @xmath1 will be the set of trace - preserving completely positive maps .",
    "we will also require a nonphysical operation @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "this @xmath5 will need the following crucial property :    * definition 1 * : ( @xmath1-commutation ) an unphysical map @xmath5 is @xmath1-commutative if for every @xmath6 there is a @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : involution ] .    note that for any unphysical @xmath5 there must be a set of states @xmath9 such that no @xmath10 has for all @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "we say that @xmath5 is unphysical on @xmath13 .",
    "the following simple lemma will be remarkably useful ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "* lemma 1 * : if @xmath5 is unphysical on @xmath13 and is @xmath1-commutative , then any @xmath14 with @xmath15 can not reliably transmit the states in @xmath13 .    *",
    "proof : * suppose there were physical encoding and decoding operations that allowed transmission of states in @xmath13",
    ". in other words , there are physical @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath18 then @xmath19 which , recalling that @xmath20 is physical , gives a prescription for physically implementing @xmath5 on @xmath13 as @xmath21 , which is impossible by hypothesis . @xmath22    note that this argument implies that if @xmath5 is continuous , and there is no physical operation that approximates @xmath5 to high precision on @xmath13 then @xmath14 can not transmit the states in @xmath13 to high precision .",
    "the rest of the paper is dedicated to extending and exploring the consequences of this line of reasoning , focusing on its application to quantum mechanics .",
    "while a quantum channel @xmath14 implicitly acts only on some particular part of @xmath0 of dimension @xmath23 , our unphysical maps will be defined for any input dimension .",
    "so , the unphysical map can be thought of as a family of maps acting on different input dimensions . to streamline notation we will suppress labels indicating this dimension whenever possible .    our usual notion of capacity",
    "is defined over many uses of a channel , @xmath24 , and we will also need to consider nonphysical maps acting on @xmath25 , which we call @xmath26 .",
    "the parentheses indicate that this map may not be a tensor product of maps @xmath5 on the individual systems , but can act jointly on all @xmath27 systems . for linear maps ,",
    "the tensor product is well defined and in this case we will typically take @xmath28 .",
    "we are now ready to consider a simple example of lemma 1 applied to the time reversal , or transpose , operation @xmath29 .",
    "recall that time reversal is an operation that preserves inner products between states , but is anti - unitary rather than unitary .",
    "it is also the canonical example of a positive map that is not completely positive . has the property that @xmath30 , for all @xmath31 but not necessarily @xmath32 for some @xmath33 on a larger space .",
    "a completely positive map @xmath34 has @xmath35 for all @xmath36 @xcite ] as such , the transpose maps states to states , but is not a physically implementable operation .",
    "in fact , letting @xmath13 be the set of all qubit states , time - reversal is unphysical on @xmath13 .",
    "now , given a channel @xmath37 letting @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 denoting complex conjugation ) , it is easy to check that @xmath40 is also a channel and furthermore @xmath41 .",
    "having demonstrated @xmath1-commutativity , we can now apply lemma 1 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that if @xmath42 is a quantum channel , so is @xmath43 for any @xmath27 , so we see from lemma 1 that any channel with @xmath44 physical must have zero capacity .",
    "translating this to a statement about the channel s choi matrix , completely characterizes the channel and is defined as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "] we find that any channel @xmath14 such that @xmath47 ( in other words a ppt choi matrix ) must have zero quantum capacity .",
    "the _ reason _ is that any capacity for such a channel would lead to a protocol for implementing the ( unphysical ) time - reversal operation .",
    "a similar argument shows that any protocol for distilling pure entanglement from a ppt state could also be used to implement time - reversal ( this is shown in the appendix ) .",
    "there being no reason to restrict to the transpose operation , we can easily see that given any continuous @xmath1-commuting @xmath26 which can not be approximated by a physical map on qubit states , then any @xmath14 with @xmath48 has zero quantum capacity .",
    "-commutation is represented by @xmath49 leading to the same result as @xmath50 .",
    "the existence of encoder and decoder that transmit states successfully though @xmath14 is indicated by the path @xmath51 which is the identity .",
    "we also assume that the path @xmath52 or @xmath53 is physical even though @xmath5 is not . then the nonphysical operation @xmath5 ( @xmath54 ) is implemented by the physical path @xmath55 . , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] +",
    "if we take @xmath5 to be a linear map that preserves system dimension , it is possible to completely characterize the zero - capacity channels detected by our method .",
    "this is achieved through the following theorem originally communicated to us by choi @xcite .",
    "we present here an alternative proof that makes an explicit connection to the theory of group representations .",
    "* theorem 1 : * take states and channels to be the usual quantum mechanics with @xmath23-level systems . if @xmath5 is linear , invertible , preserves system dimension and trace , and is @xmath1-commutative it is either of the form @xmath56 or @xmath57 .    * proof : * let @xmath5 be such a map , and consider the requirements of @xmath58-commutation . defining @xmath59",
    ", we have @xmath60 and see immediately that since @xmath61 is invertible , so is @xmath62 . since it preserves dimension and is a physical channel , @xmath62 must be simply conjugation by a unitary @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath64 , so that @xmath63 must be a d - dimensional representation of @xmath65 . since @xmath66 , this representation must be faithful ( _ i.e. _ , invertible ) up to an overall phase which will cancel under conjugation .",
    "there are only two such representations : the fundamental and complex conjugate representations .",
    "suppose we have @xmath67 .",
    "then , for all @xmath68 , @xmath69 , so that letting @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote its partial transpose , we have @xmath72 as a result , we have @xmath73 so that @xmath74 . requiring @xmath5 to preserve trace",
    ", we thus find @xmath75 .",
    "we now consider @xmath76 , which works similarly .",
    "specifically , we now have @xmath77 so that , requiring @xmath5 to preserve trace , we find @xmath78 @xmath22",
    "the above theorem shows that the only nonphysical @xmath1-commutative linear maps are of the form @xmath79 . in order to make statements about capacities",
    ", @xmath80 must also be @xmath1-commutative .",
    "the only such nonphysical map is @xmath81 . as a result detecting incapacity in non - ppt channels requires @xmath5 to be nonlinear .    in order to accommodate nonlinear maps",
    ", we must generalize our ideas about @xmath1-commutation . specifically , we introduce the following definition of @xmath1-commutation for a class of unphysical operations .    * definition 2 * : ( @xmath1-commutation ) a set of unphysical maps @xmath82 with @xmath83 is @xmath1-commutative if for all maps @xmath6 there is a @xmath7 and an unphysical @xmath5 with @xmath84 .    in eq .",
    "( [ commutedit ] ) , we were able to commute @xmath5 and @xmath17 by replacing @xmath17 with @xmath85 .",
    "the motivation behind our new definition is to allow more freedom in finding decoders that remain physical after commutation with @xmath5 , at the cost of having channel - dependent nonphysical maps @xmath86 .",
    "note that if @xmath5 is invertible , @xmath87 will define @xmath88 .",
    "now , given a @xmath1-commuting family of maps @xmath89 that are unphysical on a qubit with associated @xmath88 and @xmath5 , any channel @xmath14 for which @xmath52 is physical can not transmit all states in some set @xmath13 reliably . within quantum mechanics ,",
    "given @xmath90 , @xmath26 , and @xmath88 then if @xmath91 is physical , @xmath14 has no quantum capacity .    in quantum mechanics , any decoder can be written in terms of a unitary @xmath92 as @xmath93 which implies @xmath94 for some @xmath95 independent of @xmath96 .",
    "we therefore only need consider the simpler set of nonphysical maps @xmath97 with @xmath98 defining @xmath88 to detect the incapacity of any @xmath14 with @xmath99 physical .",
    "every quantum channel has an isometric extension to an environment .",
    "an antidegradable channel is a channel for which the environment , by further processing , can simulate the original channel @xcite . as a result of the no cloning theorem ,",
    "such channels can be shown have zero quantum capacity @xcite .",
    "we now use the nonphysical cloning operation to give a simple proof that antidegradable channels have zero quantum capacity .",
    "if @xmath100 is antidegradable with input @xmath101 and output @xmath0 , then there is an extension of @xmath100 , @xmath102 from @xmath101 to @xmath103 , such that for all @xmath68 , @xmath104 .",
    "any @xmath96 on @xmath0 has a unique decomposition @xmath105 , with @xmath106 in the range of @xmath100 and @xmath95 in its orthogonal complement .",
    "now define @xmath107 where the pseudo - inverse @xmath108 maps @xmath106 to its unique preimage in the orthogonal complement of the kernel of @xmath100 .",
    "this @xmath109 is continuous and @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath111 is physical .",
    "we can similarly extend @xmath109 to a continuous @xmath5 from @xmath112 to @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "now , let @xmath116 .",
    "choosing @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 , so @xmath122 can clone an arbitrary state and is therefore unphysical .",
    "having demonstrated a nonphysical @xmath97 , a @xmath88 and physical @xmath123 , we have so far shown that a single use of an anti - degradable channel ca nt be used to transmit a quantum state with high fidelity . however , since the tensor product of two anti - degradable channels is again anti - degradable , this also shows that many copies can not transmit quantum information either . as a result",
    ", the capacity must be zero .",
    "we have presented a general approach for detecting the incapacity for quantum communication using unphysical transformations , and shown that both known incapacity tests fall into this framework .",
    "furthermore we have discovered a connection to the theory of representations of the unitary group , and both positive partial transposition and antidegradability correspond to simple representations .",
    "this paves the way for the discovery of new incapacity tests , and theorem 1 suggests a fruitful direction , namely forbidden transformations that are not linear .",
    "we have focused primarily on the standard ( one - way ) quantum capacity , but these ideas can also be extended to the two - way capacity and questions of entanglement distillation .",
    "for example , in the appendix we demonstrate non - distillability of ppt states by showing that any successful distillation protocol could be used to implement the unphysical time - reversal operation .",
    "our argument there makes crucial use of the linearity of time reversal , which in light of theorem 1 severely restricts the detection of two - way capacity and distillability . finding an argument relating two - way capacities and nonlinear forbidden transformations is an important challenge .",
    "we end on a speculative note .",
    "we have shown that both known incapacity tests are derived from fundamentally unphysical transformations on state space : time reversal and cloning .",
    "could it be that _ any _ zero quantum capacity channel has such a `` reason '' for its incapacity ?",
    "formally , of course , the answer is `` yes''the forbidden transformation could just be a successful encoding or decoding operation for the channel .",
    "however , we would be much more satisfied with something less tautological .",
    "a good starting point might be to identify a minimal set of primitive forbidden operations that includes cloning and time - reversal as examples .",
