    "it is intuitive from such measurements that a hierarchy of structural order can be established , ranging from crystalline structures such as bravais lattices @xcite to highly disordered systems , the prototypical example of which is the ideal gas @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , quantitative descriptors consistent with this stratification of order are difficult to identify , and this area of research is currently open .",

    "this order metric explicitly indicates the degree to which density fluctuations are suppressed on large length scales .",
    "the local structure of a hyperuniform many - particle configuration ( i.e. , on the order of a few nearest - neighbor distances between particles ) is by definition indicative of the global arrangement of particles @xcite . also known as superhomogeneity @xcite , this phenomenon is fundamental to the description of all bravais lattices , lattices with a multiparticle basis , quasicrystals , and certain disordered systems possessing pair correlation functions decaying to unity exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that while hyperuniformity in periodic configurations is a trivial consequence of their intrinsic long - range order , the fact that disordered many - particle systems can also display this property is nonintuitive .",
    "this behavior is especially surprising since the appearance of hyperuniformity marks the onset of an `` inverted '' critical point in which the structure factor vanishes in the limit of small wavenumbers while the direct correlation function , defined through the ornstein - zernike formalism , becomes long - ranged @xcite .",
    "hyperuniform systems have played a fundamental role in our understanding and design of materials , including those with large , complete photonic band gaps @xcite , `` stealth '' materials invisible to certain frequencies of radiation @xcite , and prototypical glassy structures consisting of maximally random strictly jammed ( mrj ) monodisperse hard spheres @xcite .",
    "other examples of disordered hyperuniform systems include noninteracting spin - polarized fermions @xcite , the ground state of liquid helium @xcite , the density fluctuations of the early universe @xcite , one - component plasmas @xcite , and so - called @xmath1-invariant processes @xcite , in which the form of the pair correlation function is held fixed over a certain density interval .",

    "zachary , jiao , and torquato have provided strong arguments that this claim is indeed true for strictly jammed hard - particle packings @xcite , but it is unclear whether general point patterns must also possess exponents @xmath9 .",

    "strong arguments have also been put forth to support the claim that exponential values @xmath12 less than unity in the small - wavenumber region of the structure factor indicate the presence of larger interparticle voids with higher frequency , thereby deregularizing the microstructure while maintaining hyperuniformity @xcite .",

    "we provide further evidence to link rigorously the void space and the local coordination structure of a point pattern , and we highlight the differences in the void space distribution for `` regular '' and `` anomalous '' hyperuniform systems .",

    "* hyperuniform particle distributions with anomalous asymptotic local density fluctuations ( i.e. , slower than the volume but faster than the surface area of an observation window ) can be constructed , and these fluctuations are intimately related to the distribution of _ void sizes _ external to the particles ( section v ) .",
    "* with few constrained degrees of freedom ( e.g. , a perturbation from an ideal gas ) , the entropy ( configurational degeneracy ) decreases linearly with the number of constraints imposed on the particle distribution ( section v ) .",

    "v we provide explicit calculations for the void statistics of our hyperuniform point patterns under weak and strong constraints , and we draw explicit connections among the regularity of the local structure , the exponential form of the small - wavenumber region of the structure factor , and the distribution of the local voids . concluding remarks are given in section vi .",

    "it is interesting to note that equilibrium distributions of hard spheres are known not to be hyperuniform @xcite except at the close - packed density , at which point the system freezes into a crystal with long - range order .",
    "mrj hard - sphere packings are therefore unique in that they are _ nonequilibrium _ systems that are uniformly mechanically rigid , and it is this rigidity that has been shown to be essential for the onset of hyperuniformity ( with logarithmic asymptotic local density fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "importantly , rigidity places severe geometric constraints on the local arrangements of particles @xcite and has been shown to regularize the void space distribution on the global scale of the microstructure @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated in this work that by decreasing the exponential form of the structure factor within the small - wavenumber region , these void - space constraints are relaxed in accordance with the decreased effective radius surrounding the particles .",
    "since mrj packings are _ maximally _ disordered among all strictly jammed packings , it follows that such systems must already possess the maximal number of degrees of freedom consistent with the geometric constraints of strict jamming .",
    "therefore , _ any _ increase in the distribution of the void sizes is inconsistent with these same constraints , highlighting why exponents @xmath11 in the small - wavenumber scaling of @xmath0 have never been observed for such systems .",
    "our work has also raised a number of interesting questions related to the physics of collective coordinate constraints .",
    "the mathematical properties associated with collective coordinates are surprisingly subtle and have only partially been explored in the literature @xcite . constraining a collective density variable , including , for example , either a complete suppression to zero or fixing its magnitude , results in a highly nonlinear equation relating the components of the particle positions @xmath241 . for higher - dimensional systems , it has been previously observed @xcite that these nonlinear equations have a tendency to `` couple '' in such a way that one must go beyond @xmath153 to crystallize the system , meaning that one can not simply count constraints and degrees of freedom .",
    "it is an open problem to determine analytically the relationship between @xmath113 and the `` true '' number of constrained degrees of freedom ; recent work has examined the fraction of normal modes with vanishing frequency as a more appropriate indicator of the latter @xcite .",
    "we have provided some analysis here in one dimension to suggest how the configuration space is constrained with increasing @xmath113 by determining the entropy for small deviations from the ideal gas . certainly for higher values of @xmath113 our simple linear scaling will break down ;",
