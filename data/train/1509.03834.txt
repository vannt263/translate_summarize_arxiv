    "the thermotropic biaxial nematic phase which was predicted by freiser @xcite nearly four decades ago has attracted considerable attention recently for various reasons , ranging from a fundamental question of conducive experimental conditions for its realization to its envisaged applications in display devices . though predictions made by various mean - field ( mf ) theoretic treatments @xcite - @xcite , landau free energy based analyses @xcite - @xcite and computer simulations @xcite - @xcite support the feasibility of such a phase , success on the experimental front has been rather modest @xcite .",
    "experimentally the biaxial phase was first obtained in a lyotropic , ternary mixture of potassium laurate , 1-decanol and @xmath0 in 1980 @xcite and more recently in bent - core compounds @xcite , organo - siloxane tetrapodes @xcite , lc polymers @xcite and colloidal systems of goethite particles @xcite .",
    "though recent experiments @xcite point to low transition enthalpies for rod - disc systems , an unambiguous biaxial phase has not been established in such systems . from the point of view of application , it is anticipated that the minor director could switch more readily compared to the major director in an external field @xcite leading to faster response times . even in the case of recent bent - core molecules",
    "there appears to be a debate on the consistency in the experimental findings @xcite . achieving spontaneous macroscopic biaxiality in nematic liquid crystal phases with",
    "appreciable biaxial order appears at the moment to be a challenge .",
    "the recent theoretical studies on the other hand point to a more optimistic picture : they predict that the condensation of a biaxial phase could occur over a wide range of the hamiltonian parameter space of a general quadrupolar model @xcite - @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of the mean field model was noted to be unsatisfactory , as the phase behaviour of the biaxial system in the limit of vanishing intermolecular biaxial interaction traversing in the process the so - called partly repulsive region of the hamiltonian was found to be contravening the biaxial phase stability criterion @xcite . in this context",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the fact that b - ensembles constructed from simple configurational random walks based on metropolis algorithm fail to detect the second transition in this @xmath29 region merits some discussion .",
    "in order to look for the origin of the additional low temperature specific heat peak observed in the region @xmath21 t , which was not detected by boltzmann sampling , we made a comparison of the simulation results from rw - ensembles with those obtained from b - ensembles at @xmath29=0.733 @xmath183 ( landau point t ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] .",
    "the location of t is unique as it is the intersection point of the dispersion parabola with the segment iv .",
    "mf theory predicts a direct transition from the isotropic to biaxial phase at this point , and it is the only such point on the parabola .",
    "from the perspective of the interaction hamiltonian , the coordinates @xmath93 of t represent a unique symmetry : the hamiltonian has no interaction between the uniaxial components of the molecular tensor ( @xmath184 at t , see eqn .  ) , and is purely biaxial in nature ( involving @xmath6 and @xmath185 axes ) .",
    "a consequence of the present findings in this context is curious .",
    "they do confirm the presence of a direct transition from the isotropic to biaxial symmetry , but these also indicate that there is yet another biaxial - to - biaxial transition at a lower temperature .",
    "further , the onset of the first biaxial phase at @xmath150 is not leading to a natural progression of the biaxial order with decrease in temperature , and it is only after the transition at @xmath152 that the macroscopically significant and hence observable , @xmath148 value seems to be realizable .",
    "we thus focus on the landau point , and present the simulation results obtained from the two types of mc sampling methods : data from b - ensembles and from rw - ensembles .",
    "[ fig:12 ] shows the specific heat ( energy cumulant as inset ) and order parameters ( susceptibilities as inset ) , computed as a function of temperature at the point t , obtained from these ensembles .",
    "it may be noted that the derived physical variables from b - ensembles do not betray the onset of the second transition at @xmath186 , thus lending support to mf predictions , as has been noted in the earlier report on this work @xcite .",
    "we now examine the contour maps of the distribution of microstates in the entropic ensemble ( set of microstates which are approximately uniformly distributed with respect to energy ) collected at the landau point .",
    "[ fig:13](a ) depicts such a contour map in the space of uniaxial order and energy ( per site ) , along with the thermal averages computed from rw - ensembles and b - ensembles superposed for ready comparison .",
    "similarly , fig .  [ fig:13](b ) shows corresponding contour map plotted between biaxaial order and energy ( per site ) , along with thermal averages of the two canonical ensembles again superposed .",
    "the traversal path of the b - ensemble averages is seen to be encompassing regions corresponding to contour peak positions , whereas the rw - ensemble average is observed to follow a different trajectory , consequent to encompassing a wider collection of microstates visiting sparse regions , corresponding to large deviations of the order parameter .",
    "this is seen as a manifestation of the process of collection of microstates of the entropic ensemble by the algorithm employed , representative in their distribution ( with respect to energy ) of the underlying density of states . as has been pointed out and argued earlier ( fig .",
    "6 in @xcite ) , the algorithmic guidance of the wl - procedure is seeking out all accessible microstates ( an approximate microcanonical ensemble ) in each bin of energies , in the process visiting relatively rare states which correspond to larger excursions in the order parameter , and hence correspondingly larger fluctuations of the component energies of the hamiltonian in eqn .  , while conforming to the same energy bin .",
    "the requirement of an accurate determination of dos through the entropic sampling procedure apparently demands inclusion of these rare microstates , and the process of reweighting used to construct the equilibrium ensembles through this elaborate procedure , includes them in the thermal averages as a consequence .",
    "thus the differences observed in the averages from the two procedures are to be appreciated from the standpoint of simulations .",
    "as has been discussed @xcite , these rare microstates indeed correspond to situations where the ordering of either of the molecular axes ( involved in the @xmath187 symmetry of the pair - wise interaction , i.e @xmath6 or @xmath188 ) form a spontaneous and equally probable calamitic axis during the evolution of the system , by virtue of having the largest instantaneous eigenvalue of the diagonalised ordering tensors of the three molecular axes .",
    "it is apparent that conventional sampling methods , not under algorithmic compulsion to estimate the dos of the system , are not geared to sample such rare states , and hence come up with different averages . in the process",
    ", it appears that second low temperature transition is not evident in the earlier work .    in addition",
    ", we note that the deviation of the simulation results from the mean field expectations occur along the diagonal iv of the essential triangle where the pairwise interaction hamiltonian has @xmath187 symmetry and is expressed in the reduced form as in eqn .   in terms of a single parameter @xmath1 .",
    "it is observed that the deviations start from @xmath189 ( point @xmath190 and continue till the landau point where @xmath184 .",
    "it may be noted that the point k @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath191 is very close to the point @xmath192 . it can be inferred from eqn .   that , starting from the neighbourhood of k , the uniaxial attractive coupling of the @xmath193-axis becomes lower in strength than that of the ( biaxial ) attractive coupling of the other two axes , and continues to decrease as @xmath29 increases on the diagonal . as a result ,",
    "the ordering of the biaxially coupled @xmath188 and @xmath6 axes is favoured as temperature is decreased , leading to the first onset of a biaxial symmetry from the isotropic phase .",
    "this is followed by an ordering of the @xmath193-axes at a lower temperature , leading to the stabilization of both the orders , in particular biaxial order .",
    "thus it appears that the growth of biaxial order in the intermediate biaxial phase is inhibited by the lack of long range order of the @xmath193-axes ( in this region of @xmath29-axis ) .",
    "as one approaches the landau point , @xmath1 in eqn .",
    "tends to zero ( from the negative side ) , thereby suppressing the second transition temperature as well as weakening the efficacy of this term to drive a transition .",
    "this lack of concomitant ordering of all the molecular axes leads to inhomogeneity in the medium , and we tend to attribute all the interesting aspects of the simulation to this feature of the hamiltonian .    finally , we wish to comment on the curious role played by the wl - algorithm in the analysis of the phase diagram . it has been already established that this algorithm assists the system in overcoming energy barriers of the system , as the simulation pushes the system to make a random walk in the configuration space which is uniform with respect to energy . a successful convergence of the probability density yields a limiting distribution of microstates with respect to the total energy of the system - the representative density of states .",
    "the role of this algorithm in the present study seems to be qualitatively different and yet illustrative of its varied applicability .",
    "the wl algorithm , even while operating within a single energy bin ( an approximate microcanonical ensemble ) , appears to seek out rare states , corresponding to the otherwise inaccessible fluctuations of the component energies , making up the total energy ( see fig .   6 in @xcite ) .",
    "inclusion of these microstates ( as representative states for purposes of computing averages ) is naturally embedded in the wl - method , while estimating the dos accurately .",
    "we argue that the metropolis sampling fails to access these states due to apparent energy barriers within the system inhibiting sampling of microstates with such large fluctuations in their energy components .",
    "we conclude that the new results reported here are the outcome of this facet of efficiency of the entropic sampling .",
    "in conclusion , we present compelling evidences from monte carlo simulations based on entropic sampling , to propose an additional biaxial phase along a region of the arc of the essential triangle , augmenting our earlier report @xcite . the arguments advanced in this respect , particularly of the inevitable presence of inhomogeneities in the absence of a long - range order of the third stabilising axis @xmath193 , seem to lend support to the findings ( based on boltzmann mc sampling ) reported in the partly repulsive region of the @xmath29-axis ( segment tv : the @xmath1-model @xcite ) . at a more general level we conclude that the cross - coupling between the uniaxial and biaxial tensor components of the neighbouring molecules ( @xmath194-term in eqn .  ) seems to be playing an important role in determining the phase sequences .",
    "further , we suggest that its significant presence , even along trajectories inside the triangle ( which could be relevant for practical purposes ) should have such inhibitive influence on the condensation of a biaxial phase with measurable biaxial order . our recent simulational work on two such trajectories interior to the triangle are supportive of this conjuncture ( to be published ) .",
    "we thank professor n. v. madhusudana ( raman research institute , bangalore , india ) for useful discussions .",
    "the simulations are carried out in the centre for modelling simulation and design , university of hyderabad ."
