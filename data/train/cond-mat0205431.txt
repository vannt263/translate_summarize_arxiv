    "binary mixtures of colloidal particles and non - adsorbing polymers have received renewed and growing attention recently , in part because they exhibit complex and interesting structure , phase behavior , interfacial properties , and rheology  @xcite , and in part because they are excellent model systems for the study of large length and time - scale separations in complex fluids .",
    "problems with bridging length - scales are immediately apparent in even the simplest models of colloid - polymer mixtures : while the mesoscopic colloidal particles can be modeled as hard convex bodies , the polymers are often treated at the microscopic ( kuhn ) segment level .",
    "thus , even though the average size of the polymer coils may be of the same order of magnitude as that of the colloids , the number of degrees of freedom needed to model the former may be several orders of magnitude larger than what is needed for the latter .",
    "this naturally provokes the question : can the polymers also be modeled as single composite particles ?",
    "in fact , this is exactly what was done by asakura and oosawa ( ao ) who , in their classic work on colloid - polymer mixtures@xcite , modeled the polymers as ideal particles with respect to each other , and as hard - spheres with respect to the colloids .",
    "this model is strictly speaking only valid for non - interacting polymers , or for interacting polymers in the dilute limit , while many interesting phenomena such as polymer induced phase separation take place at finite concentrations of interacting polymers .",
    "our ultimate goal , therefore , is to go well beyond the ao model and describe non - ideal polymers in a good solvent up to semi - dilute densities .",
    "we recently extended the ao concept to take into account polymer - polymer interactions , first by rather naively adding a gaussian repulsion between the polymers@xcite , and then by carrying out a much more sophisticated programme which resulted in _ density dependent _ polymer - polymer and polymer - wall pair interactions@xcite , or , in a complementary approach , _ density independent _ many - body interactions@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the route to the density dependent pair potentials in much more detail than in our previous work@xcite .",
    "these density dependent interactions are derived by inverting structural information , namely the center of mass ( cm ) radial distribution function @xmath0 for the polymer - polymer interactions , and the wall - polymer or sphere - polymer cm density profile @xmath1 for the polymer - wall or polymer - sphere interactions respectively .",
    "we focus here on the considerable subtleties inherent in these inversions , in particular the importance of using thermodynamic information or related sum - rules to achieve accurate potentials .",
    "many of the lessons learned should be valid for a wider set of effective potentials . as a first example , we derive effective potentials for polymer solutions based on mid - point and end - point representations .",
    "we also revisit the problem of deriving effective potentials for a wall - polymer interaction , again emphasizing the subtleties involved in the inversion process .",
    "in addition , we show how to use a similar method to derive accurate sphere - polymer potentials , a key step towards large - scale simulations of colloid - polymer mixtures . whereas the integral over the potentials holds the key to accurate thermodynamics in the homogeneous polymer case , here the relative adsorption , defined as the integral over the density profile near a wall or sphere , is the key to achieving the correct thermodynamics .",
    "we also derive a parameterization scheme for the potentials used in the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous systems . to achieve this",
    ", we use a novel monte - carlo scheme which should be easily adaptable to a wider class of effective potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we repeat the most important aspects of the models and simulation methods we used . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pot ] we describe how to derive polymer - polymer , polymer - wall , and polymer - sphere effective potentials from self - avoiding walk ( saw ) polymer simulations , and discuss the subtleties involved in the inversion procedures .",
    "we also derive other representations of the polymer - polymer potential , such as the mid - point or end - point representation .",
    "section  [ sec : fit ] contains the fitting procedures we use to parameterize the density dependent potentials .",
    "we end with the customary concluding remarks .",
    "simple lattice models , such as the self avoiding walk ( saw ) , are widely used to describe flexible , uncharged polymers in a good solvent .",
    "their popularity stems in part from the fact that , even though they ignore all chemical details except excluded volume and polymer connectivity , these models can still reproduce the scaling behavior and many other physical properties of athermal polymer solutions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , because of their simplicity , these models are ideally suited for highly efficient numerical simulation algorithms .",
    "the saw model consists of a cubic lattice of size m on which n chains of l monomers are placed .",
    "repulsion between ( monomer ) segments is built in by allowing only one segment per lattice site .",
    "the monomer concentration is given by @xmath2 , while the polymer chain concentration is given by @xmath3 .",
    "the size of the polymers is determined from the radius of gyration @xmath4 , which , for an isolated chain , scales as @xmath5 .",
    "solutions of flexible polymers in a good solvent can be classified as a function of polymer concentration into the dilute , semi - dilute and melt regimes , each with different scaling behavior .",
    "the density or concentration at which , roughly speaking , the dilute regime crosses over to the semi - dilute regime is called the overlap concentration or density @xmath6 , defined as @xmath7 , and corresponding to 1 polymer per unit volume @xmath8 . in both these regimes , the monomer concentration @xmath9 , and",
    "the only relevant length - scale is @xmath4 .",
    "when , upon increasing the polymer density , the monomer concentration becomes appreciable , the system crosses over to the so - called melt regime where the monomer size becomes an additional relevant length - scale .",
    "thus , when modeling the semi - dilute regime , it is important to take polymer chains that are long enough , to ensure that @xmath10 is still small .",
    "the monomer density @xmath11 at the overlap concentration @xmath6 scales roughly as @xmath12 for saw lattice chains ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which implies that for polymers of finite length , there is only a limited semi - dilute regime .",
    "we studied polymers with lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for an isolated @xmath13 coil",
    "the radius of gyration is @xmath15 so that @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and @xmath18 at @xmath19 , the highest density we study for this length . for @xmath14 chains , @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 at @xmath17 , and @xmath22 at @xmath23 , the highest density studied for @xmath14 polymers .",
    "this suggests that while we do not expect the @xmath14 polymers to exhibit any significant corrections to scaling behavior for the densities studied , the @xmath13 polymers may begin to deviate slightly from the true semi - dilute regime at the highest densities .",
    "we established previously that the second virial coefficient for two @xmath13 polymers is close to the scaling limit  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that for low densities , the effective potentials , obtained by the coarse graining procedure , are very near the scaling limit where properties only depend on @xmath4 and not on @xmath24 .",
    "the saw simulations were performed by employing the monte carlo pivot algorithm  @xcite together with translational moves .",
    "this simple algorithm is sufficient to sample the configuration space at low concentration . in the semi - dilute regime ,",
    "i.e.  for concentrations @xmath25 , we use configurational bias monte carlo algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the central theme of the coarse graining procedure advocated here and in previous work  @xcite , is to replace each polymer by a single particle , interacting with the other polymer particles via an effective ( pair ) potential . for complex particles like polymers",
    ", there is some freedom in the choice of coordinate for the single `` particle '' .",
    "we have mainly used the cm , but one could also use the average monomer , the endpoints , or the midpoint as a monomer based representation ( see e.g.  the appendix of ref @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore discuss the midpoint and endpoint representations in section [ sec : midpoints ] ; a more complete analysis is planned for a future publication@xcite .      in the @xmath26 , or low density limit ,",
    "the effective potentials can be derived from the logarithm of probability of overlap of the cm of two polymer coils@xcite . calculating this overlap probability involves integrating over the polymer degrees of freedom by the monte carlo procedures described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "we sample the configurations of two polymers an infinite distance apart with the pivot algorithm , and after every 1000 pivot moves we accumulate an overlap probability histogram by testing for segment overlap as a function of the cm distance .",
    "the effective potential determined in this manner is approximately gaussian in shape , with a range of the order @xmath4 for all lengths .",
    "when the cm s completely overlap , the potential has a maximum of @xmath27 for the @xmath13 polymers and @xmath28 for the @xmath14 polymers , which is very close to the scaling limit estimate @xmath29@xcite ( since all interactions are of entropic origin , we set @xmath30 throughout this paper ) . in the scaling limit",
    "the potentials depend only on @xmath4 , so that the probability for complete overlap of the cm s of two polymers will be independent of their length @xmath24 .    at finite densities",
    "there is no longer a simple logarithmic relationship between overlap probabilities and the effective potentials@xcite .",
    "instead , we use the one  to  one mapping@xcite between @xmath0 and @xmath31 to find , for each density , the unique effective potential that exactly reproduces the two - body correlations . to generate the pair - correlations",
    ", we performed mc simulations of @xmath13 polymers on a @xmath32 cubic lattice , for several different number of polymers ranging from @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) to @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . for @xmath14 polymers we used a lattice of @xmath37 units , and the number of polymers ranged from @xmath38 @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xmath41 . during the simulations we collected the radial distribution functions between the cm of the polymers .",
    "we typically needed on the order of @xmath42 monte - carlo moves to achieve sufficient accuracy .",
    "the effective potentials @xmath43 were constructed using the one - component oz equation , supplemented by the hypernetted chain closure@xcite , which is nearly exact for the type of potentials we generate@xcite .",
    "the resulting effective pair interactions are plotted in figure  [ fig : veffl500 ] and figure  [ fig : veffl2000 ] for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 polymers respectively , and show a clear though surprisingly small density dependence .",
    "this density dependence can be understood from the effect of the density - independent many - body interactions@xcite which , for @xmath44 , are dominated by the three - body interactions .    the basic principles of the inversion procedure were already described in ref  @xcite , but here we want to point out some important subtleties that must be kept in mind when performing such inversions .    * ( 1 ) * first of all , it is important to generate accurate @xmath0 s",
    ". this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : gofr - rho0 ] , where two different potentials from figure  [ fig : veffl500 ] , namely the potential at @xmath45 and the potential at @xmath46 , were used at the same density @xmath47 to generate the radial distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "these @xmath0 s are then compared to the true saw @xmath0 at that density .",
    "even though the potentials seem quite different ( see figure  [ fig : veffl500 ] ) , the differences in the radial distribution functions are small , implying that the process which generates the @xmath0 must be significantly more accurate than the difference between the radial distribution functions in figure  [ fig : gofr - rho0 ] if one is to obtain accurate effective potentials .    * ( 2 ) * secondly , because polymers do not have a hard - core , one can achieve much higher number densities than is normally found for simple fluids@xcite .",
    "this also puts extra demands on the accuracy of the correlation functions , since at high densities very small errors tend to destabilize the oz inversion procedure , making convergence difficult to achieve .    *",
    "( 3 ) * thirdly , @xmath48 ) is only known up to half the simulation box size , rendering the inversion problem underdetermined .",
    "if the potential is known for all @xmath49 , oz techniques can be used to extend @xmath0 beyond the box - size@xcite , but when one is trying to find @xmath0 from simulations with an unknown @xmath31 , some assumption for the large @xmath49 behaviour of @xmath31 must be made .",
    "we assume that @xmath50 beyond half the box size , but this is not necessarily obvious at high density , and one needs large simulation boxes to achieve proper convergence of the effective potentials .",
    "we used boxes with sides of approximately @xmath51 .",
    "although it may seem that the potentials have vanished already at shorter distances , this is still near the minimum length necessary to ensure that there are no cut - off effects in the potentials , especially for higher densities .",
    "note that our new monte - carlo fitting procedure , described in section [ sec : fit ] , partially helps overcome this problem .",
    "an effective potential that correctly reproduces pair - correlations should , in principle , also predict the correct thermodynamics through the compressibility equation@xcite .",
    "but we stress that correctly determining the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath52 ( here @xmath53 is the polymer osmotic pressure ) or other thermodynamic properties from effective potentials can also be quite subtle .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : vrsub ] where we compare a typical potential and its fit to a single gaussian .",
    "although these potentials do not seem that different , and generate almost identical radial distribution functions @xmath0 , they result in pressures which differ by about @xmath54 .",
    "the origin of this difference is clear from the inset , where we plot @xmath55 , which is in fact a better measure of the relevant differences between the potentials than @xmath43 itself . that @xmath55 is a better indicator for the accuracy of the predicted pressure follows from the fact that potentials such as those shown in figure  [ fig : veffl500 ] , figure  [ fig : veffl2000 ] , or figure  [ fig : vrsub ] lead to mean - field fluids@xcite , so named because their equation of state approximately follows the simple mean - field form : @xmath56 for a wide range of densities . here , @xmath57 is the @xmath58 component of the fourier transform of the pair interaction , which for spherical symmetric functions involves the integral over @xmath59 .",
    "keeping these subtleties in mind , we found very good agreement between the eos generated by applying the compressibility equation to the effective potentials in figure  [ fig : veffl500 ] and figure  [ fig : veffl2000 ] and the eos of the underlying saw polymer solutions .",
    "the compressibility was calculated with the accurate hnc equation .",
    "the @xmath14 results almost exactly fall onto the @xmath14 eos computed directly by the method of dickman@xcite . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the @xmath13 eos calculated with the effective potentials is very close to the directly computed one , but at higher densities some small differences develop .",
    "we attribute these to the difficulties in achieving high accuracy for the tails of the potentials when the inversions are performed at these higher densities .",
    "we expect the @xmath13 eos to be slightly higher than the @xmath14 one at higher @xmath61 because the monomer density @xmath10 is higher for the shorter polymers , which induces @xmath24 dependent corrections to the scaling limit at the higher densities .",
    "both the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 eos , where @xmath10 remains very small at the densities probed , are slightly higher than the eos derived by renormalization group ( rg ) calculations@xcite .",
    "they approximately follow the the correct @xmath62 scaling expected for the semi - dilute regime@xcite up to the highest densities . in contrast , if one were to use the @xmath63 potential at all densities , the eos would be underestimated and would follow mean - field fluid behavior with the incorrect @xmath64 scaling at large @xmath65 instead .",
    "so , even though figure  [ fig : gofr - rho0 ] shows that the @xmath45 potential results in pair - correlations @xmath66 that are similar to the true @xmath66 s , the effective thermodynamics can differ significantly .",
    "since the density dependence of the effective pair potentials was shown to arise from the many - body interactions@xcite , this immediately suggests that the corrections to the simple linear @xmath65 scaling of the eos are due to the three and higher body interactions .      as mentioned at the beginning of this section",
    ", one could also use other representations for effective pair potentials between polymers . for star - polymers , for example ,",
    "the mid - point is a more natural coordinate@xcite .",
    "the @xmath67 arm limit of a star - polymer would correspond to a normal linear polymer , but in the mid - point representation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : vr - end ] we compare the mid - point , end - point , and cm representations of the interaction between two isolated polymer coils , all calculated in the usual way by taking the logarithm of the overlap probability for @xmath13 saw polymers on a lattice .",
    "we also compare the @xmath67 arm limit of the star - polymer interaction derived by likos _",
    "et al._@xcite , as well as an improvement especially tailored for linear polymers@xcite .",
    "the mid - point and end - point representations have a divergence at full overlap that scales as @xmath68 , so that they appear to be quite different from the cm representation .",
    "however , because the divergence is integrable in 3-dimensions , these potentials still result in mean - field fluids@xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : vr - r2-end ] where we plot @xmath69 .",
    "the divergence has disappeared , and we see once again that it is the tails of the potentials , and not the small @xmath49 behavior , which matters for the thermodynamics . while in figure  [ fig : vr - end ] the differences between the 2-arm limit of the star - polymer potential and the true mid - point potential are quite small ( just fractions of @xmath70 ) , figure  [ fig : vr - r2-end ] , together with eq  [ eq : eos ] , shows that they will generate dramatically different eos .",
    "but even the specially tailored mid - point potential , which appears to almost perfectly follow the simulations in figure  [ fig : vr - end ] , differs visibly when plotted as @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast , for the saw simulation , the three different representations , mid - point , end - point , and cm , should all lead to the same eos , provided that , as expected , the volume terms are similar and small@xcite .",
    "these observations demonstrate a more general point , also mentioned in the previous section : just because a fit to a potential appears to be very close to the original potential , does not necessarily mean it will generate the correct thermodynamic behavior ; great care must be taken to ensure that the fit conserves the right quantities .",
    "( note that the fit in ref .",
    "@xcite was indeed constrained to give the correct 2nd virial coefficient , which will result in the correct low density thermodynamics . )    in principle , one can also derive density dependent potentials for the mid - point or end - point representations , just as was done for the cm representation . in figure  [ fig : vr - mid - rho ] , we show the mid - point potentials which reproduce the mid - point @xmath0 s generated from direct saw polymer simulations .",
    "we used the same hnc inversion techniques used earlier for the cm representation , and expect similar accuracy .",
    "in summary then , while there is some flexibility in the choice of coordinates , many of the lessons learned for the cm representation carry right through to the other representations@xcite .",
    "so far , we have only considered effective polymer - polymer pair potentials , but a full coarse grained description of a colloid - polymer mixture , or , more generally , of polymers in confined geometry , requires effective potentials between polymers and ( colloidal ) surfaces as well .",
    "we focus here on non - adsorbing surfaces , and calculate the effective interaction between polymers and a hard wall , and between polymers and a hard sphere ( hs ) .",
    "the former is important for such systems as mixtures of polymers and platelets , or mixtures of polymers and very large spheres ; the latter helps provide a model for mixtures of spherical colloids and larger polymers .",
    "near a hard non - adsorbing surface , entropic effects create a polymer depletion layer , even if the chains themselves are non - interacting .",
    "although there is no polymer - polymer interaction when modeling such ideal chains , there will still be a finite wall - polymer potential @xmath72 .",
    "this interaction can be found for ideal polymers near a wall by the simple result @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the polymer density at a distance @xmath75 from the surface and @xmath65 is the uniform bulk density . for polymers in an end - point representation",
    ", the interaction reduces to @xmath76 , while for polymers in the mid - point representation @xmath77@xcite .",
    "a similar result should follow in the cm representation , but we have not yet succeeded in obtaining an analytic form .",
    "asakura and oosawa@xcite modelled polymers as ideal w.r.t .  each other , and with a hard sphere potential @xmath72 of range @xmath4 w.r.t .",
    "spheres or walls . here",
    "we extend their work and calculate the @xmath72 that exactly reproduces the density profiles @xmath74 measured by direct simulations of saw polymers near walls or spheres .",
    "first we consider saw polymers near a hard wall .",
    "the effective polymer - wall potentials @xmath78 can be derived from the @xmath74 by combining the wall ornstein zernike equation with the hnc closure , leading to @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the bulk polymer direct correlation function .",
    "the details of this inversion procedure are given in ref .",
    "in contrast to the homogeneous case , the inversion involves only one iteration , because the bulk polymer - polymer potentials and hence @xmath80 are already known .    using the same explicit saw polymer model as in section  [ sec : model ] , we performed mc simulations of polymers of length @xmath13 on a lattice of size @xmath81 with hard planar walls at @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the polymer segments were not allowed to penetrate the walls .",
    "the simulations were done for @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . during each simulation , we computed the density profiles @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the distance between the polymer cm and the wall .",
    "the normalized profiles @xmath86 , for different bulk concentrations @xmath65 , are shown in figure  [ fig : hz ] .",
    "the wall - polymer potentials @xmath78 were obtained using the wall - oz - hnc inversion procedure and are plotted in figure  [ fig : vz ] .",
    "the wall is essentially still hard , but is now softened by an additional exponentially decaying repulsion .",
    "the density dependence is more pronounced than in case of the effective potentials for bulk polymer solutions .",
    "the potential for a polymer coil interacting with a colloidal hs of diameter @xmath87 can be found from the density profile @xmath1 around the sphere .",
    "here @xmath49 is the distance from the center of the colloidal hs .",
    "the inversion procedure is very similar to that of the wall - polymer potential geometry .",
    "for a binary mixture of two components labeled c and p , in which colloidal component c is infinitely dilute @xmath88 , the binary oz equations decouple , and reduce to @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath80 is again the bulk polymer direct correlation function which is determined independently .",
    "the above equation can be combined with the hnc closure to yield @xmath91 which can be solved in one step by fourier transformation .",
    "figure  [ fig : hrrad16 ] shows the polymer density profiles @xmath92 around a single colloidal hs particle with a diameter of @xmath93 .",
    "the effective potentials are plotted in figure  [ fig : vrrad16 ] .",
    "the interaction appears to be somewhat softer than for the planar wall case , at least in the sense that it is still finite at distances that correspond to the cm being `` inside '' the hard colloidal particle .",
    "this happens more readily for smaller size - ratios @xmath94 because the polymers can deform around the colloids .",
    "note that this penetration into the colloidal hs will not occur in the mid- or end - point representations .",
    "polymers in the semi - dilute regime have traditionally been very successfully understood with scaling theories@xcite . there",
    "the fundamental unit is no longer the radius of gyration @xmath4 at zero density , but the blob - size @xmath95@xcite , which appears both in the eos , where @xmath96 , and in the relative adsorption @xmath97 . for the homogeneous polymer solutions , it is not clear from either the @xmath0 or from the effective potentials where the blob - size comes in .",
    "the reason the effective potentials correctly reproduce the eos is because they correctly reproduce the pair - correlations , which , through the compressibility theorem@xcite , give the correct thermodynamics",
    ". this blob - size only appears in the potentials if one attempts to parameterize them for @xmath98 ( roughly speaking the density at which the scaling sets in ) , since the integral over @xmath71 should scale as @xmath99 .",
    "since we only parameterize the potentials for lower densities , this scaling does not apply to the functional form we use .    for polymers near a wall",
    "the width of density profile of the monomers scales with @xmath95 in the semi - dilute regime@xcite . a similar scaling",
    "is expected to hold for the width of the cm density profile .",
    "so even though @xmath95 is not immediately evident in the effective wall - polymer potentials , it is present in the induced density profiles .",
    "nevertheless , many questions as to the direct relationship between the scaling theories and our soft - colloid approach remain to be worked out .",
    "partially for that reason , some care must be taken when applying the soft - colloid picture deep in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "the semi - dilute regime scaling theories are not normally valid in the dilute regime , where we expect our soft - colloid approach to be robust .",
    "when applying effective potentials in coarse grained simulations or in theoretical analysis , it is convenient to have an explicit expression or parameterization of the potentials . in ref.@xcite",
    "we fitted the effective pair potentials we obtained by inversion of the @xmath0 to a single gaussian and described the remainder by means of a spline fit .",
    "however , for practical use in simulation or for a theoretical analysis , one would like to use an analytic expression without the complication of a multi node spline fit .",
    "moreover , it would be very useful to be able to explicitly model the density dependence of the potentials as well .",
    "since we are dealing with an approximately gaussian form , the simplest analytical expression is a sum of gaussians with density dependent coefficients : @xmath100 where we introduced @xmath101 for clarity . here",
    ", the gaussians are centered at @xmath102 , because the maximum of the potential is located at the origin .",
    "the density dependence comes in through the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in first instance",
    ", we take the coefficients to be linear in density , i.e. @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "note that an expression of this form can not describe the slightly negative tails in the potential that were found in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , as was argued in the previous section , the structure is not very sensitive to small changes in @xmath107 .",
    "a more important aspect of the fitting procedure is to make sure that the fitted potentials lead to the correct eos . to do this",
    "we make use of the accurate mean field approximation in eq  [ eq : eos ] . because this is such a good approximation , keeping the @xmath58 fourier component @xmath108 for the fitted potential @xmath109 equal to that of the original potential @xmath107 ensures that the pressures will also be ( almost ) equal .",
    "a fitting procedure should therefore include the constraint @xmath110 which results in one of the coefficients being fixed by the constraint .",
    "the @xmath111 itself is a smooth function of the bulk density @xmath112 ; we fit it to a cubic polynomial .",
    "the inverted potentials @xmath113 were fitted to eq  [ eq : gauss ] by applying a standard least squares non - linear fitting procedure  @xcite including the above constraint . to obtain a good fit of all the potentials for @xmath114 we needed at least 3 gaussian terms , particularly to correctly describe @xmath115 . for higher densities ,",
    "the linear density dependence in eq  [ eq : gauss ] broke down .",
    "this can partly be understood from the fact that the potential at @xmath102 increases almost linearly for @xmath114 but decreases for higher concentration ( see inset of figure  [ fig : veffl500 ] ) .",
    "clearly , a linear fit in the density can not cope with this behavior .",
    "higher order polynomials for the coefficients were not very successful either .",
    "a better option would be to fit the potentials for high densities independently , and then ensure continuity at the crossover .",
    "after using the non - linear fitting procedure to directly fit the potentials , the best fit coefficients in eq  [ eq : gauss ] can be further fine - tuned by minimizing the difference between the radial distribution function @xmath0 of the saw polymers and the @xmath116 generated from the fitted potential @xmath117 .",
    "this minimization procedure works as follows . for a certain density @xmath118",
    ", we first calculated @xmath116 for @xmath109 with the best fit coefficients using the hnc approximation .",
    "we then compare this @xmath116 to the original radial distribution function @xmath119 , measured in the explicit saw simulation at the same density , by determining the least square difference : @xmath120 .",
    "we performed this calculation for every density @xmath121 we have saw data for , summing up to @xmath122 .",
    "subsequently , we changed one of the coefficients by a small amount and determined the difference @xmath123 again .",
    "if the difference between the fitted @xmath116 and the saw data @xmath124 becomes smaller , the new coefficient was accepted , otherwise the old coefficient was restored .",
    "these steps were repeated , until the difference reached a minimum value and changes in the coefficients were no longer accepted .",
    "the final coefficients only represent a local minimum , so this monte carlo type minimization procedure can not be applied without a good initial estimate for the fit coefficients .. on the contrary , it depends strongly on the quality of the original non - linear fit described above .",
    "note that by using this optimization we skip one step , namely the inversion of the original @xmath0 .",
    "if a small error was made in the inversion , for example by our assumption that @xmath125 for @xmath126 , it should be corrected during the optimization .",
    "however , one must keep in mind that the minimization procedure only finds a local minimum .",
    "larger errors may not be corrected .",
    "we applied the above fitting procedure to the bulk polymer results for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficients are given in table  [ table1 ] and table  [ table2 ] , respectively .",
    "one of the coefficients , @xmath127 , is fixed by the constraint of eq  [ eq : const ] : @xmath128.\\ ] ] note that this implies that in contrast to the other coefficients , @xmath127 is no longer linear in density .",
    "the best fit coefficients for both lengths are not far from each other , again indicating that the results are close to the scaling limit .    to illustrate the importance of explicitly including the constraint of eq  [ eq : const ]",
    ", we applied the same non - linear fitting procedure , including the monte - carlo optimization , but without the constraint . in figure  ( [ fig : compvhat ] ) we compare @xmath111 , which is a good measure for the eos , for the constrained and the unconstrained case .",
    "clearly , including the constraint is essential for reproducing the correct thermodynamic behavior .",
    "at this point we would like to return to a statement made in an earlier paper@xcite , where we emphasized the importance of the very small negative tails we found from our inversion procedure . because the tails are so small , their effect on the radial distribution functions is almost imperceptible .",
    "it is only when they are multiplied by @xmath129 that they become important for the eos .",
    "our current fitting procedure ignores the negative tails , but because we force the sum - rule on @xmath71 , the thermodynamics are still correctly reproduced .",
    "therefore our previous statements on the importance of the tails should be tempered .",
    "it is actually the sum - rule on the pair - potential which is critical to achieving the correct thermodynamics .",
    "a similar fitting procedure as in the previous section can be applied to the effective wall - polymer potentials . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the effective wall - polymer potential @xmath130 can be fitted reasonably by the cubic exponential function @xmath131\\ ] ] as before , the density dependence can be introduced through the coefficients @xmath132 .",
    "here we chose a quadratic density dependence , because a linear expression yielded a poor fit .",
    "we fitted the potentials @xmath133 using the non linear fit method of the previous section but without any constraint .",
    "subsequently , the coefficients were optimized using the minimization procedure mentioned above .",
    "the optimized best fit coefficients are given in table  [ table3 ] , and the @xmath134 generated by these fitted potentials are shown in figure  [ fig : hz ] .",
    "the fit seems to be reliable for @xmath135 , but , unfortunately , begins to break down in the semi - dilute regime . for the highest densities ,",
    "the reproduced @xmath134 show more structure than the density profile obtained from the saw simulations .",
    "clearly , eq  [ eq : hzfit ] can not completely capture all the wall - polymer effects in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "the functional form of eq  [ eq : hzfit ] is rather _ ad hoc _ , and the fit would probably be better if one had access to a more accurate analytical expression based on physical arguments .    similarly to the bulk polymer case , one needs to compare surface thermodynamic properties to ensure the quality of the fit .",
    "we focus on the polymer adsorption at the wall , @xmath136 , defined as the partial derivative of the excess grand potential @xmath137 per unit area with respect to the chemical potential @xmath138 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the surface area . in figure",
    "[ fig : gamma ] we show that the adsorption @xmath136 is indeed well represented by the fits .",
    "so , even though for high densities the structure next to the wall is not well described by eq  [ eq : hzfit ] , the integral over @xmath141 is still accurately represented . since the adsorption @xmath136 is given by the integral over @xmath141 , instead of an integral weighted by @xmath142 , the tails of the potentials are less important to the correct thermodynamics than in the case of the bulk polymer potentials .",
    "in fact , if the adsorption @xmath136 and the eos are known as a function of the density , then the surface tension of the polymer solution can be calculated with the gibbs adsorption equation@xcite .",
    "therefore , since the fitted wall - polymer potentials give the correct @xmath136 , and the polymer - polymer potentials give the correct @xmath143 , when used together they should provide an accurate representation of surface tensions and related surface thermodynamic quantities .",
    "in the case of a spherical particle , the fit to the sphere - polymer potential is more straightforward .",
    "once again we can use a sum of gaussians to estimate the potential @xmath144 here , because of the size difference between the colloidal particle and the polymer coil , we allow the gaussians to be off center . in the non - linear fit for the @xmath93 data , we set @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and assumed a linear density dependence of the coefficients .",
    "subsequently , the coefficients were optimized using the minimization procedure .",
    "the results are given in figure  [ fig : hrrad16 ] and table  [ tab : rad16 ] .",
    "the @xmath147 reproduces the measured @xmath148 quite well . to check the quality of the fit we compared in figure  [ fig : gamma2 ] the adsorption of the saw polymers around the sphere with the optimized potentials",
    ", in contrast to the planar wall case , we do have to integrate over @xmath149 .",
    "we would therefore expect that the deviations are larger than for the wall .",
    "however , although the agreement is not as good as in the wall case , the adsorptions are still well represented , thus giving us confidence that the fits are adequate .",
    "in this paper we have shown in detail how to use oz techniques to derive effective potentials potentials for polymer solutions from direct simulations of saw polymers . just as many subtleties were found in the original application of oz inversion techniques to simple atomic and molecular fluids , so we find that great care must be taken to correctly invert and fit our effective potentials .",
    "we found that @xmath0 is not very sensitive to differences in @xmath31 , which is very similar to the situation for atomic and molecular fluids@xcite .",
    "this insensitivity places strong demands on the accuracy of the original @xmath0 s needed as input for our inversion procedures .    for the polymer - polymer potentials , it is crucial that the integral over @xmath55 is correctly represented .",
    "seemingly very small differences in the tails of @xmath31 , which in turn result in almost imperceptible changes in @xmath0 , can nevertheless result in large differences in the eos .",
    "this principle should hold not only for linear polymers in the cm , end - point or mid - point representations , but also for low arm - number star polymers@xcite , dendrimers@xcite , and other mean - field fluids .",
    "we also derived density - dependent wall - polymer and sphere - polymer potentials by directly inverting the one - particle density profile @xmath1 calculated by direct simulations of @xmath13 saw polymers . here ,",
    "the important thermodynamic parameter is the adsorption @xmath136 , which is quite well reproduced by our fitted potentials . since our effective potentials provide a good representation of the eos and of the adsorption , they should lead to an accurate representation of the surface tension and other related surface thermodynamic properties of polymer - colloid mixtures .    and finally , while one might think that most of the hard work is done once effective potentials have been inverted from direct simulations , fitting these potentials for their use in large - scale simulations of colloid - polymer mixtures is far from trivial .",
    "we showed how to use a numerical optimization procedure to ensure the accuracy of our fits . because this optimization procedure skips the direct inversion step , it can remove residual errors in the inversions , guarantee that the fits conserve the right sum - rules , and lead to the correct thermodynamics .",
    "we emphasize that these conclusions should hold for a much broader class of effective potentials than the ones we discussed here .",
    "the ultimate goal of our research project@xcite is to model large - scale mixtures of polymers and colloids .",
    "the coarse - graining of the polymers from the `` microscopic '' saw chains to single composite entities interacting via effective density dependent pair potentials is a crucial step toward that goal .",
    "the next step will be to use the accurate fits derived in this paper to perform direct simulations of many spherical colloids interacting with many polymers .",
