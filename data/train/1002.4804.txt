    "<S> , it is now clear that , in planar cavities with disorder amplitude @xmath0 comparable to the mode homogeneous broadening @xmath55 , the generation of quantum squeezing can be severely limited by nonlinear coupling between disordered states . </S>",
    "<S> this critical condition @xmath123 is actually achieved in semiconductor gaas microcavities , which have been experimentally investigated in recent works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results also show that the system where photonic energy levels are separated much more than the homogeneous broadening @xmath55 the ideal single - mode kerr squeezing can be recovered . </S>",

    "<S> are obtained already in a micropillar with a @xmath124 diameter and a level separation larger than the broadening can be achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the complete suppression of extracavity noise can be detected only by using a local oscillator @xcite with the same spatial shape as the ground photonic wavefunction .    in conclusion , we have presented a theory for the role of photon localization on the nonlinear generation of quantum squeezing in a disordered planar microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the ideal single - mode quantum noise reduction is limited by nonlinear multimode coupling between disordered eigenmodes , even when the modes are in the vacuum state . </S>",
