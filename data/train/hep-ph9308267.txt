    "with the discovery of asymptotic freedom , qcd has become the accepted theory of hadrons .",
    "however , at the energy scale of the formation of hadrons ( about a few gev or less ) , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) can no longer be applied alone , and nonperturbative qcd ( np ) becomes important and may even rule . in this regime , we have very limited tools we can use to understand what is going on .",
    "there is a fundamental dimensional constant giving a qualitative citerion of separating these two energy regions , @xmath0 .",
    "we use the modified minimal subtraction renormalization scheme , @xmath1 , throughout this paper .",
    "we can hope for some progress in understanding the interplay of nonperturbative and perturbative qcd in those processes where both play a role .",
    "it may even be important to understand the relation of perturbative and nonperturbative contributions in order to obtain @xmath2 from experiment .",
    "the photon structure function in @xmath3 has been a useful tool to study qcd .",
    "it has been calculated perturbatively to nonleading order , which is necessary to obtain a meaningful comparison with qcd predictions for other processes @xcite . while valid asymptotically , the pqcd prediction is modified at attainable @xmath4 by the presence of a np part , usually called the  hadronic \" component of the photon .",
    "( this is an unfortunate usage and we will refer in the following to the pqcd and np contributions to the photon structure function . )",
    "our point of view in this paper is that the photon structure function is valuable precisely because it contains both pqcd and np contributions at not too large @xmath4 .",
    "this may make it a unique process in which we can study both of these as functions of the kinematic variables .",
    "the most information can be extracted from this process by studying the photon structure function for a virtual photon target whose invariant mass ,  @xmath5 \" , can vary over a range from zero to some appreciable @xmath6 .    here",
    "we exploit the moments of the photon structure function from the calculation of uematsu and walsh for the perturbative part of the struncture function @xcite .",
    "( in particular , we use the normalization and conventions of that paper . )",
    "we use the suggestions of various authors for the nonpurturbative part @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hadronic \" part to the function has been obtained by these authors by fitting experimental data from other processes .",
    "typically , one finds the pion structure function from a semihadronic process such as @xmath7 .",
    "the static quark model and vector dominace are then used to obtain a conjectured np component to the photon structure function .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is to examine the behavior of the total photon structure function ( including both pqcd and np parts ) as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath8 , with the aim mentioned above of finding out how to distinguish the two experimentally .",
    "first we describe models for the np contribution  including the @xmath4 dependence often left out of consideration .",
    "we then discuss the real and virtual photon structure functions .",
    "we then present our results for the @xmath8 behavior of the two components of the structure function .",
    "we are interested in the kinematic region @xmath9",
    "gev@xmath10 gev@xmath11 and @xmath12 gev@xmath11 .",
    "we would like to stimulate experimental studies of this range of variables .    throughout this paper",
    ", we set the quark mass to zero and the number of quark flavors to four . while interesting and relevant to a comparison with experiment at high @xmath4 , a consideration of quark mass effects here would distract from our main point .",
    "we think that it is very much an open question how the nonperturbative component of the photon structure function is to be treated . for the present",
    ", we describe the conventional view .",
    "we return to the question later in the paper . according to this conventional view ,",
    "the overall real photon structure function is a sum of two parts , @xmath13 it is customary to write the nonperturbative contribution to the photon structure function @xmath14 as a coherent sum of light vector meson states . from this vector meson dominance model",
    "we can then identify the np part of the photon structure function @xcite , approximated by the @xmath15 meson contribution , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be obtained from the pion structure function using the quark model @xcite , @xmath19 here we denote @xmath20 as @xmath21 for convenience and similarly for the others .",
    "we also put @xmath22 in the pion .",
    "this assumes that we are at low enough @xmath4 so that we can neglect sea quarks",
    ". then equation ( [ f2h ] ) becomes @xmath23 from now on we confine ourselves to @xmath24 gev@xmath11 where we expect that our neglect of sea quarks will be adequate . from definitions of the non - singlet and the singlet quark distribution functions we can write a quark structure function in terms of the non - singlet and singlet parts of the structure function @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 runs over all available flavors , here we choose the number of flavors to four , @xmath28 .",
    "the final form of @xmath14 of the photon structure function becomes @xmath29.\\ ] ] we have @xmath30 for the pion in this example .",
    "the moments of the nonperturbative part of the structure function are then @xmath31 our procedure will be to obtain @xmath32 and @xmath33 at all @xmath4 through numerical integration of the altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "so we can calculate @xmath34 at any @xmath4 , given its starting value .",
    "we now need to determine the starting value of the @xmath15 meson or pion structure function at some low @xmath35 .",
    "we use three different fits which were obtained by three groups newman et .",
    "@xcite , na3 collaboration at cern @xcite , and castorina et al .",
    "all these fits have been obtained at @xmath36 gev@xmath11 .",
    "we will show all the solutions to the altarelli - parisi equations for the corresponding np contribtutions to the structure function .",
    "we emphasize that we have no convictions as to which of the resulting np parts is the correct one .",
    "our aim later in this paper will be to see to what extent they can be distinguished experimentally for @xmath37 .",
    "we will include three examples of non - singlet ( ns ) , singlet ( s ) , gluon ( g ) parts of the structure function at @xmath38 .",
    "the general form of the parametrizations of the hadronic functions can be written as @xmath39 since the three fits are given as @xmath40 which yield the nonperturbative structure functions considering only the dominant @xmath15 meson @xmath41 the first of these is slightly at odds with our neglect of sea quarks , since it goes to a finite limit as @xmath42 . since our aim is only to compare different assumptions about the @xmath15 meson structure function for high moments , we will use it anyway .",
    "let us consider the ratios of the momenta carried by quarks and gluons .",
    "since @xmath43 inside the @xmath44 at low @xmath4 , we can only consider the @xmath45 for quarks .",
    "we define the ratios for the quarks and gluons as @xmath46 we can calculate @xmath47 using the three fits @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the euler beta function with @xmath50 , @xmath51 . therefore the values of @xmath47 for each fit are @xmath52 from the qcd momentum sum rule we have @xmath53 so that @xmath54 we can determine @xmath55 directly from @xmath47 with the assumption of no sea quark contribution to the total momentum at the low initial value of @xmath4 regardless of the form of the gluon structure function .",
    "the parametrization of @xmath56 is up to us to determine .",
    "the simplest form of the gluon structure function at @xmath38 is @xmath57 we can find the value of @xmath58 from the qcd momentum sum rule after making an assumption of the value of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) which could in principle be determined from experiment .",
    "we choose @xmath61 here . using the momentum sum rule",
    "again we obtain @xmath62 this equation yields @xmath63 let us look at the values of @xmath47 for the three examples .",
    "in example ( a ) 26% of the total momentum is carried by the @xmath45 quark and thus 48% of it is carried by gluons in @xmath15 ( or @xmath64)-meson .",
    "similar agument applies to other examples although , with the model that we suggest , the example ( b ) seems to have too big gluon momentum ( 66% ) compared to quarks ( 34% ) .",
    "the authors of reference ( c ) chose @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath66 which seems small compared to our result @xmath67 .",
    "however , one needs to keep in mind that the model for the gluon structure function here is only the simplest one and all three fits to the experimental data are perfectly acceptable .",
    "this analysis is independent of the number of vector mesons .",
    "however , in the nonperturbative part of the structure function we need to sum over all the vector mesons coherently . for example",
    ", we will have about 60% enhancement in the nonperturbative part when we include the incoherent sum of all vector mesons @xmath68 and @xmath69 in addition to the dominant @xmath15 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we confine ourselves only to the @xmath15-term for simplicity .    in the numerical calculation",
    ", we evolve the equations from @xmath70 gev@xmath11 to @xmath71 gev@xmath11 with @xmath72 gev . the evolution of the nonsinglet function can be obtained in a straight forward manner using the above hadronic functions . in coupled equations of singlet and gluonic functions",
    "we assume the initial gluon distribtuion in the form of equation ( [ glust ] ) with no initial sea quark distribution .",
    "we use the normalization factor @xmath73 and we cut at very low @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and high @xmath74 ( @xmath76 ) to avoid numerical problems at the end points .",
    "we show the moments of the np part of the structure function , @xmath77 , in figure  [ npmoments ] with the normalization factor , @xmath73 .",
    "the qualitative behavior of np of three fits are same .",
    "they decrease fast at low @xmath4 while the rate of the decrement becomes small at high @xmath4 .",
    "this means that we do not expect very small np contribution at a given moment to the structure function even at high @xmath4 .",
    "therefore we expect the np contribution to the total structure function persists even at high @xmath4 as we will see in the next section .",
    "we will come back to this point in the real and the virtual cases .",
    "the pqcd moments of the real photon structure function can be written as @xmath78 where the expressions and the values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are given in reference @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath82 in the right hand side of the equation is from the difference in normalizations of structure functions between reference @xcite on which our calculation is based and reference @xcite .",
    "the approximation comes from omitting the higher orders in @xmath83.\\ ] ] @xmath2 is given in the @xmath1 scheme and @xmath84 is the coupling constant with two - loop order term , @xmath85 let us go back to the equation ( [ rpsf ] ) ; then we have @xmath86 we split the total structure function into two parts as before .",
    "we use the results in @xcite for the perturbative qcd part of the structure funciton and the previous three examples for the np part .",
    "we can recover bardeen and buras s moments from uematsu and walsh s ones formally by putting @xmath87 .",
    "we write the moments of the real photon structure function in equation ( [ xrtot ] ) as @xmath88 we obtain the total real photon structure function in each moment by summing the nonperturbative and the perturbative contribution for the corresponding expressions . as we saw in figure [ npmoments ] , the np parts of the structure functions decrease relatively fast at low @xmath4 while the rate slows down as @xmath4 increases . on the other hand pqcd increases fast at low @xmath4 and slowly at high @xmath4 as we see in figure [ realcase ] .",
    "this is a reasonable result since we expect that np contribution becomes larger than that of pqcd at a low @xmath4 .",
    "if we add the two contributions , the total structure functions , @xmath89 , for @xmath90 increase very slowly at high @xmath4 after normalizing by the factor @xmath91 . here the dashed curve indicates the pqcd part and a , b , and c indicate the total structure functions for the three examples .",
    "all the moments ( for @xmath92 ) increase rather slowly after @xmath93 gev@xmath11 .",
    "we choose different scales for figure [ realcase](a ) and figure [ realcase](b ) to distinguish explicitly the curves for those examples .",
    "we also notice the faster decrease of the np part compared to pqcd at higher moments .",
    "the total real structure functions for all three fits are more or less the same .",
    "we found that the np contribution to the total structure function is about 10% around @xmath94 gev@xmath11 when @xmath90 and slightly less when the moments become higher and @xmath4 gets larger .",
    "let us now move on to a virtual target photon . consider a deep inelastic scattering involving two photons with momenta @xmath95 for the probe photon and @xmath96 for the target photon .",
    "we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 as the probe photon mass and the target photon mass respectively .",
    "we take the kinematic region of the momenta of the photons as follows .",
    "@xmath99 the moments of the structure function can be calculated by solving the renormalization group equation for the wilson coefficient in the operator product expansion of photon - photon scattering to leading order in @xmath100 and to next to leading order in @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102   , \\label{momnlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 are given in references @xcite , @xcite and the index @xmath27 runs over @xmath106 , @xmath107 , ns .",
    "notations , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , ns are from the eigenvalues , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , of the one - loop hadronic anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "@xmath110 is the coupling constant to two loops .",
    "now , equation ( [ momnlo ] ) is valid for @xmath111 since the singular behavior of the coefficient @xmath112 , which causes a problem in the real photon structure function , is cancelled by the factor , @xmath113 when @xmath114 goes to zero . since the expression ( [ momnlo ] )",
    "is independent of any renormalization scheme , to change the equation from one scheme to another all we have to do is to write @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 in the new scheme .",
    "we now write @xmath119 with the corresponding moment functions @xmath120 we continue to follow the convention and the simple vector meson dominance model for the nonperturbative part of the structure function by writing its dependence on @xmath8 as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the real photon nonperturbative part which we have been discussing up to this point . in the previous section we simply had @xmath123 .",
    "this is the only consistent way of including the @xmath8 dependence once we adopt the notion that the np part of the photon structure function can be approximated by the simple vector dominance model .",
    "as @xmath124 increases , the moments are sharply suppressed in exactly the same way as for the real photon case .",
    "note that the @xmath111 case is possible for both the nonperturbative and perturbative parts in the virtual photon structure function while only the nonperturbative part appears in the real structure function case .",
    "since the pqcd structure function of the real photon can be obtained from the virtual photon structure function formally by putting @xmath87 , it makes sense to replace @xmath8 in our expressions by @xmath125 .",
    "then we return to the real photon structure function by setting @xmath123 rather than @xmath126 .",
    "this modification does not affect our calculation much since we need @xmath123 and @xmath127 .",
    "henceforth we write the pqcd piece with this change .    in figure [ total ]",
    "we show the total virtual photon structure function , @xmath128 , versus the probe photon mass @xmath4 from pqcd and np after normalizing the structure function by @xmath129 . these display the strong nonperturbative dependence of the total structure function at low @xmath4 ( @xmath130 gev@xmath11 ) and at low moments .",
    "perhaps the most interesting behavior of the function occurs in the regions @xmath131 gev@xmath132 gev@xmath11 and @xmath133 gev@xmath11 .",
    "as the moments increase we observe similar behavior to that in the real photon case .",
    "it is useful to look at the @xmath111 moment in the virtual structure function since there is no such moment in the real case .",
    "in fact we found interesting behavior of the structure functions in our three examples .",
    "when @xmath134 gev@xmath11 , we have qualitatively same behavior for all three fits while the fit ( a ) behaves very differently when @xmath135 gev@xmath11 .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that we have used only @xmath15 meson in the analysis .    from these plots",
    "we can clearly see how the np contribution behaves , given different assumptions about its form at @xmath123 .",
    "we close with a comment on the pqcd transition to the real photon case .",
    "the virtual photon structure function can be reduced to the real structure function by taking the target photon mass equal to zero ( i.e. , @xmath87 in equation ( [ momnlo ] ) ) .",
    "then @xmath136 goes to the infinity where quark confinement start occurring .",
    "the equation ( [ momnlo ] ) becomes @xmath137 .",
    "\\label{rvpsf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now this expression is valid only for @xmath138 since we can not calculate the moment for @xmath111 case in the real structure function due to the existence of unknown hadronic matrix elements .",
    "if we compare two equations ( [ rpsf ] ) and ( [ rvpsf ] ) in the @xmath1 scheme ( @xmath2 and @xmath139 are defined in the equation ( [ gs ] ) ) , @xmath140.\\ ] ] from the above equation we can easily identify @xmath141 therefore we obtain all coefficients in bardeen and buras form from those in uematsu and walsh .",
    "the nonperturbative part of the photon structure function has been of interest for a long time . at low @xmath4",
    "it complicates efforts to check qcd experimentally and to extract the scale factor @xmath2 .",
    "these problems can be dealt with in part by studying the photon structure function for higher moments where the prediction of qcd is stable against the higher order corrections @xcite and where the nonperturbative part is small .",
    "( of course this depends at least in part on the common assumption that the np part vanishes quickly as the scaling variable @xmath142 . )",
    "the agreement of pqcd with experiment and a value @xmath143 mev is striking @xcite . nevertheless , it is still of interest to know to what extent the np part of the structure function is really under control at low @xmath4 .",
    "we have argued here that one should explore the dependence of the virtual photon structure function on target @xmath8 .",
    "then one can determine to an adequate extent just how important the np part is .",
    "we think that this is clearly possible , given our results for the several np models which we have studied .",
    "this has a number of consequences .",
    "first , by learning the actual size of @xmath144 , we can improve checks on the pqcd prediction and extract a more reliable value for @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , the np part and its relationship to the conventional pqcd prediction is of interest by itself .",
    "we know that checks of pqcd for high moments are satisfactory",
    ". however , we also know that we have no prediction for the @xmath111 moment at @xmath145 .",
    "it is a surprising and interesting fact that the virtual photon structure function has a calculable @xmath111 moment .",
    "if we want to understand the relationship of perturbative and nonperturbative qcd , this problem needs to be explored experimentally .",
    "equivalently , we need to understand the behavior of the structure function as @xmath42 for both real and virtual photon targets . the existence of a finite or logarithmically rising cross section for the center of mass energy @xmath146 at fixed @xmath6 is a presumably nonperturbative phenomenon .",
    "this is related in some yet unknown way to the relation of perturbative and nonperturbative contributions to the structure function for small x. we think that this is an important issue .",
    "it is as yet unexplored by experiment .",
    "we can illustrate one unresolved issue by returning to our bland assumption that the np part of the structure function can be obtained from the vector meson dominance model .",
    "while we have used this assumption to show that the np part can be studied , we do question it .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence can be studied by means of a dispersion relation in the target @xmath147 , with threshold at @xmath148 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the np part of the structure function does have a contribution from small values of the mass parameter in this dispersion relation .",
    "in particular , there is a double pole at @xmath149 corresponding to the simple @xmath15 dominance model which we have studied .",
    "however , the np terms in the photon structure function which are inverse powers of @xmath150 are not in fact so simple .",
    "we expect that the dominant terms behave as @xcite , @xmath151 in writing this , we have chosen to turn an expansion in powers of @xmath152 into one which is well behaved as @xmath153 .",
    "this represents an assumption about how higher order terms behave which we think is reasonable ( but not proven ) .",
    "only one of these terms can be thought of as corresponding to the vector meson double pole term , if @xmath154 .",
    "the other might have physically an interference term between a vector meson pole ( for @xmath155 ) and another term with no pole in @xmath156 .",
    "we can see no reason why the second term can not be important .",
    "we do not know of theoretical arguments which could establish its physical significance or size .",
    "we believe that these considerations make it clear why the @xmath8 dependence of the photon structure function is worth careful experimental study .",
    "we hope that these experiments will be carried out . as yet , little has been done in this promising area at the interface of perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics .",
