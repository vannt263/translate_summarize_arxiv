    "the physics problem we address is cp violation around the finite temperature mssm electroweak phase transition .",
    "cp violation is one of the requirements for baryogenesis , and it is thus of interest to ask whether it would be available to a sufficient extent in the mssm , where the phase transition can be strong enough to account for the non - equilibrium constraint  @xcite .    in particular , we are here interested in the phenomenon of spontaneous cp violation .",
    "spontaneous cp violation can in principle take place in any two higgs doublet model  @xcite , but for the physical mssm parameters it can not be realized at @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been suggested that it might be more easily realized at finite temperatures  @xcite , or even only in the phase boundary between the symmetric and broken phases  @xcite .",
    "as described in  @xcite , this questions can be studied with 3d effective fields theories and non - perturbative lattice simulations .",
    "more specifically , we report here on preliminary results concerning the following two questions : + 1 .",
    "is there a homogeneous thermodynamical phase in the mssm for some parameter values and temperatures , where cp is spontaneously violated ? + 2 .",
    "could cp also be violated at the phase boundary between the usual symmetric and cp conserving broken phases ? +",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 . the theory we consider here is & & _ = 14 f^a_ijf^a_ij + _ a=1 ^ 2 + _ 3 o_1o_2 + _ 4 m^m + & & + .",
    "this theory is an effective theory for finite @xmath5 mssm if the right - handed stop mass is not smaller than the top mass .",
    "the opposite case leading to a strong transition , necessitates a dynamical su(3 ) stop triplet field , but we defer that discussion to a future publication  the results do not differ qualitatively from the present ones .",
    "we have also neglected the dynamical effects of the hypercharge u(1 ) subgroup . using the symmetries of the lagrangian",
    ", we can parametrize the two higgs doublets as h_1 = (    l 1 + 0    ) , h_2 = (    l e^i +    ) . it turns out that in the case relevant to us , @xmath6 , the angle @xmath7 settles dynamically to zero , so that we do not consider it any more .    for real parameters ,",
    "this theory is even under both of the discrete symmetries c , p. the c symmetry , @xmath8 , corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "while parity is not spontaneously broken in this theory , the c symmetry can be , thus violating also cp  @xcite .",
    "cp violation is signalled by @xmath10 .",
    "the region of the parameter space where there is cp violation can be found by minimizing the effective potential of the theory in with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "we do this first at the tree - level .",
    "first of all , it is easy to understand that to get @xmath10 , one needs _ 4 - 2 _ 5 <",
    "the first condition is automatically satisfied in , say , the mssm where @xmath12 .",
    "the second condition can also be satisfied : @xmath13 ( as well as @xmath14 ) can be generated radiatively .",
    "the @xmath15 generated is typically very small , though , @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , the stability of the 3d theory itself sets an upper bound : @xmath17 would make the theory unbounded from below .    for the mass parameters",
    ", there are essentially two conditions to be satisfied .",
    "the first is rather easy to understand : denoting @xmath18 , we note that there is a non - trivial minimum for @xmath11 , if  @xcite < 1 . since @xmath15 , as well as @xmath19 , are small , this essentially means that @xmath20 should be very small compared with @xmath21 .",
    "the second condition is less obvious , but in fact a stronger one .",
    "indeed , one should take into account that @xmath22 in are not free parameters but are determined by the equations of motion . as was argued in  @xcite , this leads at the tree - level to the constraint m_1",
    "^ 2+m_2 ^ 2 2 _ 5 v^2 .",
    "the aim of this study is to see how these conditions get modified by radiative corrections , first at 1-loop level , and then in the full non - perturbative system .",
    "we can then compare , e.g. , with the values of @xmath23 allowed by the mssm .",
    "= 6.3 cm    adding to the tree - level potential the dominant 1-loop corrections from the vector bosons , the parameter space leading to cp violation can still be completely mapped out .",
    "we show a projection of this region in [ scan ] . in this figure",
    ", we have imposed an upper bound @xmath24 , since it is only such values which are realized around the electroweak phase transition , and also since otherwise the finite temperature expansion used in the construction of the effective theory breaks down .",
    "after the constraint on @xmath25 , @xmath15 is restricted to small values , @xmath26 .",
    "we observe that @xmath27 is small compared with @xmath28 , as required by .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath29 given by , on the other hand , gets modified by numerical factors , but not in order of magnitude .",
    "= 5.3 cm    finally , we wish to compare the perturbative results in [ scan ] with non - perturbative lattice results . in order to do so ,",
    "we choose a particular way of increasing @xmath29 in a way that we cross the boundary of the cp violating phase .",
    "we then wish to see whether larger values are allowed in the full system than in [ scan ] .",
    "the operators we measure on the lattice are @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the order parameter for cp violation .",
    "typical results from lattice simulations at small volumes are shown in [ mflatt ] .",
    "we observe that the location of the transition does not change significantly from the perturbative value @xmath33 for these parameters .",
    "we thus conclude that perturbation theory is relatively reliable , and [ scan ] is quite a satisfactory approximation for the part of the parameter space leading to cp violation .",
    "we can now compare the region leading to cp violation with that allowed by the finite @xmath5 mssm .",
    "consider , in particular , , , or the corresponding projections in [ scan ] .",
    "first of all , it turns out that a small @xmath20 as required by can be obtained more easily at finite @xmath5 than at @xmath0 .",
    "thus , it seems that spontaneous cp violation could be possible .",
    "unfortunately , the other constraint , , is stronger and works in the opposite direction .",
    "indeed , at finite @xmath5 in the mssm ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , m_1 ^ 2 + m_2 ^ 2 m_a^2 + 0.53 t^2 + ... where the remainder is positive .",
    "thus , at temperatures below @xmath34 gev relevant for the electroweak phase transition , @xmath35 for @xmath36 gev .",
    "this does not agree with , nor overlap with the region shown in [ scan ] .",
    "we have addressed the first of the questions of the introduction , and found a negative answer : one does not end up in a phase where cp is spontaneously violated in the mssm .",
    "a light stop changes some aspects of the analysis , but the conclusion seems to remain the same .",
    "let us then consider the second question .",
    "now , the analysis above indicated that spontaneous cp violation is always more likely at large vevs , cf .  , .",
    "thus it seems quite unlikely that cp would be violated in the phase boundary , if it is not violated in the broken phase .",
    "as we have found that the broken phase of the mssm is always cp symmetric , the answer to the latter question seems also to be negative .",
    "a solution of the perturbative equations of motion within the phase boundary points in the same direction  @xcite .",
