    "good transportation networks should have small detour values . in a railroad system , access is only possible at stations , the vertices of the graph .",
    "hence , to measure the quality of such networks , we can take the maximum detour over all pairs of vertices .",
    "this results in the well - known concept of _ graph - theoretic dilation _ studied extensively in the literature on spanners , see @xcite for a survey .    however , if we consider a system of urban streets , houses are usually spread everywhere along the streets .",
    "hence , we have to take into account not only the vertices of the graph but all the points on its edges .",

    "_ @xmath15 on which we concentrate in this article .",
    "several papers @xcite have shown how to efficiently compute the geometric dilation of polygonal curves .",
    "besides this the geometric dilation was studied in differential geometry and knot theory under the notion of distortion , see e.g.  @xcite .     a section of the grid from @xcite which has small dilation , less than 1.678 . ]    ebbers - baumann et al .",
    "@xcite recently considered the problem of constructing a graph of lowest possible geometric dilation containing a given finite point set on its edges . even for three given points",
    "this is not a trivial task .",
    "for some examples , clearly a steiner - tree with three straight line segments is optimal . in other cases",
    "a path consisting of straight and curved pieces is better , but it is not easy to prove its optimality .",
    "therefore , ebbers - baumann et al .  concentrated on examining the dilation necessary to embed any finite point set , i.e. the value @xmath16 the infimum",
    "is taken over all embedded planar graphs  @xmath0 with a finite number of vertices , where the edges may be curves like discussed above .",
    "for example , a scaled hexagonal grid can clearly be used to embed any finite subset of @xmath17 like the example in figure  [ dilationexample - fig]b .",
    "the geometric dilation @xmath18 of this grid is attained between two midpoints of opposite edges of a hexagon .",
    "ebbers - baumann et al .  introduced the improved grid shown in figure  [ improvedhexgrid - fig ] and proved that its dilation is less than  @xmath5 .",
    "they showed that a slightly perturbed version of the grid can be used to embed any finite point set .",
    "thereby they proved @xmath19 .",
    "they also derived that @xmath20 , by showing that a graph @xmath0 has to contain a cycle to embed a certain point set @xmath21 with low dilation , and by using that the dilation of every closed curve  @xmath8 is bounded by @xmath22 .",

    "and intuition suggests that one can not embed complicated point sets with dilation @xmath23 because every face of the graph would have to be a circular disk .",
    "this idea would have to be formalized and still does not rule out that every point set could be embedded with dilation arbitrarily close to @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we need the result presented in section  [ ringresult - sec ] . we show that cycles with dilation _ close _ to @xmath23 are _ close _ to circles , in some well - defined sense ( lemma  [ ring - lem ] ) .",
    "the lemma can be seen as an instance of a _ stability result _ for the geometric inequality @xmath22 , see  @xcite for a survey .",
    "such results complement geometric inequalities ( like the isoperimetric inequality between the area and the perimeter of a planar region ) with statements of the following kind : when the inequality is fulfilled `` almost '' as an equation , the object under investigation is `` close '' to the object or class of objects for which the inequality is tight .",
