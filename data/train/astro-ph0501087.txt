    "these wavelength ranges include the @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xmath27  emission lines .",
    "we first searched for periods in each of our photometric data sets using the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) routine @xcite , a technique for finding periods in a data set by minimizing scatter about a light curve . for a given input data set and range of test frequencies , pdm will compute a light curve and a binned light curve from the input data for each test frequency , and the dispersion of the data about the mean light curve",

    "the appearance of this frequency in our data set suggests that something has changed within the binary system that would contribute to emission and absorption at the @xmath36 beat frequency , which is most likely an extended hot spot region along the outer edge of the disk .",

    "june observations .",
    "given the moderate time resolution of our data as presented , this shift in phase will be unnoticeable . ]",
    "in addition to the binary eclipse , the light curve also displays quite a bit of variability throughout its entirety .",
    "this is a result of the combined effects of the x - ray flickering behavior of ex hya and the poor phase coverage of the _ rxte _ data .",
    "each phase bin was covered only once or twice during the entire observation , in which case any flickering in individual cycles of ex hya will not be averaged out .",
    "in particular , the flickering seen at @xmath53 should not be confused with the bulge eclipse at @xmath54 seen in lower energy x - ray data ( @xmath55 kev , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the binary phased light curve has had the sinusoidal spin modulation subtracted . on an absolute count rate scale",
    ", it can be seen that the binary eclipse does not go to zero , implying a partial eclipse of the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "this is a result of the lower accreting pole being eclipsed by the secondary , while the upper pole remains in view .",
    "unfortunately , our @xmath40 data set is not extensive enough to analyze binary light curves extracted at different phase segments of the spin period .    in creating the spin",
    "phased light curve , shown in the right panel of figure  [ x_phot ] , we omitted data from binary phases @xmath56 , which correspond to the binary eclipse .",
    "the x - ray flickering present in the binary phased light curve is also seen throughout the spin phased light curve . ignoring this flickering , one can see that the data folded over spin phase exhibit a roughly sinusoidal modulation , peaking at @xmath57 , which is the signature of a rotating white dwarf accreting at both magnetic poles .",

    "figure  [ sp_lc ] displays the optical photometry of ex hya folded on the spin ephemeris and binned to 0.02 in phase .",
    "marked on the figure are the spin phase designations of maximum ( @xmath60 ) , minimum ( @xmath61 ) , rise ( @xmath62 ) , and decline ( @xmath63 ) , which will be used for the analysis of the photometry folded on the binary orbital period .",
    "data from the binary eclipse , @xmath56 , have been omitted in the spin phased light curves .",
    "the @xmath15 light curves are modulated sinusoidally ( solutions for the sinusoidal fits of the form @xmath64 are given in table [ sp_fit ] ) and peak at @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath16 light curve contains quite a bit of `` wiggle '' , which is a result of modulations over the binary orbital period translating into the spin phasing .",
    "we do not believe that any of the @xmath16 modulation is due to the secondary star . the optical spectra ( out to @xmath66 ) as well as an infrared spectrum obtained by one of us ( sbh ) during the campaign do not reveal any spectral features that could be associated with the secondary .    the maximum phase of @xmath67 of the spin phased light curves matches well with the value of @xmath68 determined from our _ euve _ photometry @xcite , but differs from the value of @xmath69 obtained using the uv continuum flux from our _ hst _ data @xcite , and also the value of @xmath57 we determine in this paper for the x - ray photometry . the discrepancy between the phases of spin maximum",
    "will be addressed in @xmath70[compare ] .",
    "figure  [ bp_lc ] displays representative light curves of the optical photometry folded on the binary ephemeris .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ bp_lc ] shows the @xmath29 binary phased light curve after the sinusoidal spin modulation has been subtracted .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ bp_lc ] shows the @xmath29 data separated into spin maximum ( top ) and spin minimum ( bottom ) .",
    "each light curve has been binned to 0.02 in phase .",
    "the light curves exhibit typical behavior of an eclipsing binary system , with an eclipse near phase @xmath71 .",
    "this eclipse has typically been associated with an occultation of ( part of ) the white dwarf by the secondary star .",
    "recently , though , it was questioned if this was a white dwarf eclipse , as the binary eclipse in euv data of ex hya appears at @xmath72 @xcite ; it was suggested that the optical eclipse was that of the hot spot on the outer edge of the accretion disk .",
    "eclipse timings by @xcite show that the eclipse minimum shifts between spin phases @xmath73 and @xmath74 by about 20 s. assuming a binary separation of @xmath75 , they determine that the shift in eclipse minimum corresponds to an eclipse of material located ( roughly ) on the white dwarf surface . while our data do not have the high time resolution required to perform a detailed analysis such as this , close inspection of the unbinned light curves shows that the binary eclipse during @xmath74 ( rise ) occurs ahead of the binary eclipse during @xmath73 ( decline ) by @xmath76 s , consistent with the earlier results of @xcite .",
    "the spin separated light curves shown in the right panel of figure  [ bp_lc ] reveal additional information about the binary system .",
    "inspection of the binary eclipse shows an extended egress shoulder on the spin minimum eclipse .",
    "this behavior is also seen in @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath16 .",
    "this shoulder would be caused by an extended object ( as compared with the white dwarf ) coming out of eclipse , such as the bulge along the outer edge of the accretion disk , or , as we will discuss later , a region at the inner accretion disk radius where an overflow stream impacts with the magnetosphere ( such a geometry would be favored during spin minimum ) .",
    "a similar feature in the binary eclipse has also been reported by @xcite for ex hya during outburst .",
    "apo spectra from 2000 may 28 are shown in figures  [ avg_spec ] and [ hlines ] .",
    "figure  [ avg_spec ] presents the mean blue and red spectra , which contain strong balmer emission lines , as well as and emission .",
    "figure  [ hlines ] presents velocity line profiles of the @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 emission lines plotted over the binary orbital period .",
    "the lines exhibit a double - peaked shape over all binary phases , indicative of emission from an accretion disk , and have average fwhm values of @xmath77 , or @xmath78 .",
    "the s - wave component of the emission lines , contributed by the hot spot on the outer edge of the accretion disk , is clearly visible as a red - shifted or blue - shifted component in the @xmath26 , @xmath24 , and @xmath22 emission lines throughout most binary phases .",
    "the exact behavior of the s - wave component varies between the emission lines . in @xmath26 ,",
    "the s - wave is red - shifted during the early binary phases of @xmath79 and has strongest zero - velocity emission during @xmath80 , the phases during which we are afforded a view of the hot spot on the opposite side of the accretion disk .",
    "the s - wave component is blue - shifted from @xmath81 , is missing ( or at least much less prominent ) from @xmath82 , the phases during which we would expect to see the hot spot directly on the near edge of the disk , and is red - shifted again at @xmath83 .    in the @xmath24 and @xmath22 emission lines",
    ", the s - wave component follows the general behavior of that seen in the @xmath26 line , with a few exceptions .",
    "the s - wave component is at zero velocity at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where the @xmath26 s - wave component is red - shifted .",
    "it also becomes blue - shifted at earlier phases , around @xmath86 for both the @xmath24 and @xmath22 lines , while it is still at zero - velocity in the @xmath26 line .",
    "the s - wave component also appears to bounce back and forth between being red- and blue - shifted during binary phases @xmath87 .",
    "another intriguing feature of the @xmath22 and @xmath24 emission lines during these phases is that there is little to no zero - velocity emission .",
    "taking the general behavior of the s - wave component from all three lines , we can infer geometric properties of the hot spot and bulge on the outer edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the s - wave component is red - shifted from @xmath88 , at zero velocity around @xmath89 , and is blue - shifted from @xmath90 .",
    "after @xmath91 , the s - wave component disappears .",
    "the zero velocity emission phase at @xmath89 tells us that the s - wave component is dominated by emission on the opposite side of the disk , between phases @xmath92 on the accretion disk .",
    "this emission therefore appears as a red - shifted component from @xmath88 .",
    "the s - wave is only blue - shifted when this component moves toward the observer , during phases @xmath93 . at phase @xmath94 , material begins to obscure our view of the hotter parts of the hot spot , and so the s - wave component disappears . from the missing s - wave emission during phases @xmath87 , and the absence of any zero velocity component in the emission lines",
    ", we can infer that there is vertically extended material along the outer edge of the disk obscuring the s - wave and zero velocity components starting at @xmath91 .",
    "this extended material is likely irradiated along its inner edge by the white dwarf , and gives rise to the s - wave emission .",
    "further evidence for extended emission along the outer edge of the disk is seen in the doppler tomogram for the @xmath26 emission line , displayed in figure  [ tom ] .",
    "the tomograms shown in the figure are measured from spectra obtained on 2000 may 28 and are plotted over binary orbital phase .",
    "the @xmath26 tomogram shows enhanced emission along the outer edge of the accretion disk , for approximately @xmath95 in phase .",
    "extended emission along the outer edge of the accretion disk is also indirectly observed in the euv data of ex hya , in the form of absorption of the euv emitting region @xcite .",
    "this absorption also lasts for approximately half of an orbital phase .",
    "each tomogram exhibits a bright area of emission at @xmath96  this is the hot spot and is the origin of the s - wave component .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath24 tomograms also show enhanced emission that appears to extend from the region at @xmath96 toward the inner regions of the disk ( @xmath97 , see  [ rv ] ) .",
    "@xcite observed evidence of disk overflow in ex hya during its 1998 outburst . in x - rays ,",
    "the overflow stream was indirectly observed as an @xmath36 beat modulation , and in the optical , the overflow stream was detected via its eclipse and from line emission at the site of the stream impact with the magnetosphere .",
    "we checked aavso data of ex hya for the time period immediately preceding and following our observations , but the available data show no evidence of an outburst .",
    "in fact , the data points for ex hya show it sitting at @xmath98 mag , which is its normal quiescent brightness .",
    "this would rule out a period of enhanced mass transfer as the cause of the overflowing material inferred from our data , as such an event would likely be indicated by an increase of the system brightness .",
    "tomograms plotted over the white dwarf spin phase were also constructed ; however , these show no coherent emission sites .",
    "it has also been shown previously @xcite that tomograms of ex hya folded on the spin phase reveal little information .",
    "measuring the central wavelengths of the h emission lines proved to be a challenge , as the double - peaked nature of the lines and the contribution of the s - wave component made it difficult to use a single gaussian profile for determining line parameters .",
    "we therefore used a method for fitting a double - gaussian profile to the emission lines , which measures radial velocities from emission line wings ( d. w. hoard 2004 , private communication , for a description of double - gaussian fitting see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we created radial velocity curves for the @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 emission lines .",
    "figure  [ opt_rv ] displays the radial velocity curves for the @xmath26 and @xmath24 lines .",
    "strong asymmetries due to emission from the hot spot prevented accurate determinations of @xmath99 or @xmath100 from fitted sine curves , but a fit of the form @xmath101 to the @xmath26 line ( shown on figure  [ opt_rv ] ) gives @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath99 value of @xmath105 is in agreement with our previous value of @xmath106 determined from narrow uv emission lines @xcite , but slightly lower than a previous value of @xmath107 determined from optical emission lines by @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the radial velocity of the s - wave component in each of the h emission lines .",
    "we found that the velocity amplitude of the s - wave emission places the emission site at @xmath108 from the center of the white dwarf for the @xmath26 component and at @xmath109 from the center of the white dwarf for the @xmath24 and @xmath22 components .",
    "the smaller value obtained from the @xmath24 and @xmath22 radial velocities may be due to contamination from the overflowing material .",
    "if we assume that the s - wave component originates at the outer edge of the accretion disk , the placement of the @xmath26 s - wave component gives an outer disk radius of @xmath110 .",
    "the inner accretion disk radius may be measured from the high velocity emission line wings , which extend at least to @xmath111 ( figure  [ hlines ] ) .",
    "this velocity gives an upper limit to the inner disk radius of @xmath112 for a @xmath113 white dwarf or @xmath114 for a @xmath115 white dwarf .",
    "a comparison of data from all wavelength regimes can lead us to an overall picture of ex hya .",
    "signatures of an extended bulge along the outer edge of the accretion disk are seen in the euv photometry as absorption of the euv emitting region on the white dwarf surface , in the optical spectroscopy as enhanced emission in the @xmath26 emission line tomogram , and as absorption of the zero velocity components of the @xmath24 and @xmath22 emission lines during certain binary phases .",
    "the absorption at phases @xmath116 in the euv photometry match well with the absorption in the @xmath24 and @xmath22 emission lines , seen at @xmath117 .",
    "the fact that the bulge is not present as a source of continuum emission in the binary phased light curves implies that the bulge material is optically thin .",
    "some form of overflowing material is seen in the doppler tomograms of the @xmath22 and @xmath24 emission lines as enhanced emission extending from the hot spot toward the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "other evidence for overflowing material comes from the blue - shifted velocities of the balmer lines at @xmath86 .",
    "one may also infer the existence of an extended / overflowing hot spot from the extended egress shoulder of the binary eclipse during spin minimum phases , which implies that an additional source , other than the white dwarf , is coming out of eclipse .",
    "some inconsistencies remain .",
    "the first is the phase of spin maximum as derived from light curves of continuum and emission line fluxes .",
    "x - ray spin maximum occurs at @xmath57 , euv at @xmath68 , uv continuum at @xmath118 , uv emission lines at @xmath119 , and optical at @xmath65 .",
    "the difference in the phase of spin maximum has been reported previously by @xcite for their simultaneous x - ray and optical observations .",
    "an extended accretion region on the white dwarf surface would be an initial suggestion for the difference in phase of spin maximum ; however , one would expect that the high energy spin maxima would be coincident , but this is not the case .",
    "another inconsistency is the phase of the binary eclipse across wavelength regimes .",
    "x - ray and optical data show the binary eclipse at @xmath120 , while euv data displays two eclipses near , but not at , @xmath121 : one at @xmath72 and the other at @xmath122 .",
    "the euv eclipse at @xmath122 could be an eclipse of the disk overflow stream impact with the magnetosphere , though this region would not be expected to be bright in the euv .",
    "but there still remains the phase difference of the binary eclipse .",
    "the difference between the euv and x - ray eclipses could be reconciled by the fact that the _ rxte _ coverage of those phase bins is not nearly as extensive as the _ euve _ coverage .",
    "perhaps observations that provide better phase sampling would show the x - ray eclipse slightly earlier in phase .",
    "in such a case , then , a physical displacement between the higher and lower energy emitting regions could be the cause of the phase difference of the binary eclipses .",
    "we have presented simultaneous x - ray and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy of the ip ex hya obtained as part of a large multiwavelength observational campaign of ex hya .",
    "the data provide evidence for an extended bulge along the outer edge of the accretion disk , corroborating our euv results @xcite . over the binary orbital period ,",
    "the zero - velocity component of the optical emission lines is seen to be absorbed during binary phases @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath26 tomogram also shows enhanced emission along the outer edge of the accretion disk at phases @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath22 tomograms also indicate that some amount of material may be extended from the hot spot toward the inner regions of the accretion disk .",
    "combined together , the data suggest that ex hya may be experiencing a period of enhanced mass transfer , as the data presented here bear similarities to the outburst data of 1998 .",
    "the system remained , however , at its quiescent brightness of @xmath124 mag during the observations .",
    "perhaps there was a period of enhanced mass transfer that was not recorded , or ex hya may not have returned entirely to its quiescent state after outburst .",
    "finally , we would like to call the attention of the reader to an initial light curve of ex hya published by ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) prior to knowledge of ex hya as an ip ( i.e. , no spin modulation was subtracted from the light curve ) .",
    "this light curve ( which has @xmath125 between eclipses ) shows none of the modulation associated with the white dwarf spin period that is so prevalent in our 2000 photometric data ( @xmath126 between eclipses ) .",
    "obviously , conditions within ex hya , e.g. , a larger bulge or extended accretion curtains , have changed in order to produce the enhanced emission .",
    "it is apparent that obtaining over one million seconds of data has only increased the number of questions we have about ex hya .",

    "<S> the intermediate polar , ex hydrae , was the object of a large simultaneous multiwavelength observational campaign during 2000 may  june . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the rossi x - ray timing explorer photometry and optical photometry and spectroscopy from ground - based observatories obtained as part of this campaign . </S>",
    "<S> balmer line radial velocities and doppler maps provide evidence for an extended bulge along the outer edge of the accretion disk and some form of extended / overflowing material originating from the hot spot . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the optical binary eclipse possesses an extended egress shoulder , an indication that an additional source ( other than the white dwarf ) is coming out of eclipse . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the x - ray and optical results with the results obtained from the euv and uv observations from the multiwavelength data set . </S>"
