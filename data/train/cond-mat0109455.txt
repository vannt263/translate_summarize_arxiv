    "one of the distinguishing features of the last decade has been a spectacular advancement of knowledge in the field of _ nanotechnology_. within a subfield that we might call `` nanomechanics '' , the topic of _ noise - induced transport _",
    "@xcite which concerns the mechanisms whereby one can extract useful work out of ( nonequilibrium ) fluctuationshas increasingly captivated researchers .    in the early works it seemed to be a requisite for the operation of microscopic rectifying devices ( usually known as `` molecular motors '' ,",
    "`` brownian motors '' , or `` ratchets '' ) thatbesides a built - in ratchetlike biasthe fluctuations be correlated @xcite .",
    "that requirement was relaxed when `` pulsating '' ratchets , in which the rectifying effect arises from the random _ switching _ between uncorrelated noise sources , were discovered @xcite .",
    "a recent twist has been to relax also the requirement of a built - in bias : a system of periodically coupled nonlinear phase oscillators in a symmetric `` pulsating '' environment has been shown to undergo a noise - induced nonequilibrium phase transition , wherein the spontaneous symmetry breakdown of the stationary probability distribution function ( spdf ) gives rise to an _ effective _ ratchetlike potential .",
    "some of the striking consequences of this fact are the appearance of _ negative _ ( absolute ) zero - bias conductance in the disordered phase , but near the phase - transition line ( for small values of the bias force @xmath0 , the particle current @xmath1 opposes @xmath0 ) , and _ anomalous hysteresis _ in the strong - coupling region of the ordered phase ( the @xmath1 vs @xmath0 cycle runs _ clockwise _ , as opposed for instance to the @xmath2 vs @xmath3 cycle of a ferromagnet ) @xcite .    exploiting our previous experience @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite we addressed the model using an explicit mean - field approach ( see e.g.ref .",
    "we undertook a thorough exploration of the ordered phaseincluding the characterization of its subregions and the transition from anomalous to normal hysteresis in the behaviour of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath0and found a close relationship between the shape of the spdf and the number of `` homogeneous '' mean - field solutions on one hand , and the character of the hysteresis loop on the other .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the multiplicative noises are expected to exhibit some degree of time - correlation or `` colour '' . hence in this work , and as a natural continuation to ref .",
    "@xcite , we study ( in mean - field approximation ) the consequences of a",
    "_ finite _ correlation time @xmath4 of the multiplicative noises in the model of refs .",
    "@xcite . in the following sections we briefly describe the model and its mean - field treatment , and discuss our numerical results regarding the influence of colour on the phase diagram and on the transition from anomalous to normal hysteresis inside the ordered phase .",
    "* the model : * let us consider the following set of @xmath5 _ globally _ coupled stochastic equations of motion , in the overdamped regime : @xmath6 the stochastic variables @xmath7 are phaselike [ @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the period of the @xmath10 and the equation is meant to be interpreted in the sense of stratonovich . the second term in eq .  ( [ eq:1 ] ) models , as usual , the effect of thermal fluctuations [ the @xmath11 are _ additive _ gaussian white noises with zero mean and variance one : @xmath12 , and @xmath13 represents the temperature of the environment ] .",
    "the `` pulsating '' potentials @xmath14 are one of the key ingredients in the model @xcite . including a `` load force '' @xmath0 as a tool for the analysis of the noise - induced ratchet effect , their form is @xmath15 namely they consist of a static part @xmath16 and a fluctuating one : gaussian noises @xmath17 with zero mean couple _ multiplicatively _ ( with intensity @xmath18 ) through a function @xmath19 .",
    "whereas in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath17 were taken as white with variance one , we now regard them instead as ornstein - uhlenbeck , with self - correlation time @xmath4 : @xmath20 .    besides being _ periodic _ , @xmath16 and @xmath21 are assumed to be _ symmetric _ @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( there is no _ built - in _ ratchet effect ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is @xmath24 , hence @xmath25 . with the choice @xmath26 , the direction of the particle current @xmath1 turns out to be _ opposite _ to that of symmetry breaking in the spdf @xmath27 : it is this effect which leads in turn to such oddities as _ negative zero - bias conductance _ and _ anomalous hysteresis",
    "the interaction force @xmath28 between oscillators is a periodic function of @xmath29 ( also with period @xmath9 ) and in refs .",
    "@xcite is chosen as @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "we shall fix @xmath32 and @xmath33 as in refs .",
    "@xcite , so the important parameters in the model are @xmath34 and @xmath18 .",
    "the model just set up can be visualized ( at least for @xmath35 ) as a set of overdamped pendula ( only their phases matter , not their locations ) interacting with one another through a force proportional to the @xmath36 of their phase difference ( this force is always attractive in the reduced interval @xmath37 ) .    *",

    "a nonzero @xmath61 is always associated with a symmetry breakdown in @xmath27 ( namely , @xmath71 ) .",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) are coloured , the process @xmath44 in eq.([eq:4 ] ) is in principle not markovian and for non - markovian processes , a fpe can at most result from some ( non - systematic ) approximation , like the truncation of some short correlation - time expansion .",
    "fortunately , a consistent markovian approximation ( called `` unified coloured - noise approximation '' or ucna ) can be performed under certain conditions . by resorting to it",

    "the self - consistency equations : * the stationary probability distribution @xmath27 also depends on @xmath70 and @xmath69 , since @xmath72 contains these parameters .",
    "their values arise from requiring self - consistency , which amounts to solving the following system of nonlinear integral equations : @xmath73 these equations give @xmath69 and @xmath70 for each set of the parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath34 ) that define the state of the system , assumed @xmath13 , @xmath74 and @xmath0 fixed .    for @xmath59 ,",

    "( [ eq:6 ] ) [ in the form@xmath78 implies that the stationary probability distribution is also an even function of @xmath76 .",

    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , with @xmath75 . although plausibility arguments , detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , allow to have an intuition on the existence of some solutions to this integral equation ( and their stability ) in this _ symmetric _ case , the stability of the _ true _ solutions must be explicitly checked . since @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) is an even function of @xmath76 , it suffices to use the curie - weiss one - parameter criterion , namely to check whether the slope at @xmath70 of the integral in eq .  ( [ eq:11 ] ) is less or greater than one . as a complementary check ,",
    "a small-@xmath76 expansion of @xmath77 @xcite confirms that @xmath27 is indeed gaussian at @xmath80 . for _",
    "small _ @xmath81 , @xmath27 gets multiplied ( in this approximation ) by @xmath82\\,(\\cong 1+fx / t)$ ] which leads to a nonzero value of @xmath83 , with @xmath84 . by the mechanism discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for large enough @xmath18 it is @xmath85 and by eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) it is @xmath86 .",
    "this effect manifests itself in a _ negative zero - bias conductance _ since according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) , @xmath87 .    as a consequence , for @xmath59",
    "there are always one or more solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) with @xmath75 and one of these is the stable one in the `` disordered '' phase .",
    "as argued in ref.@xcite , for @xmath39 a noise - induced nonequilibrium phase transition takes place _ generically _ towards an `` ordered '' phase where @xmath71 . in the present scheme",
    "this asymmetry should be evidenced by the fact that the solution with @xmath75 becomes unstable in favor of two other solutions such that @xmath88 , characterised by _ nonzero _",

    "this fact confers on @xmath70 the rank of an order parameter .    * the phase boundary : * since @xmath90 is an antisymmetric function , eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) results impractical for the task of finding the curve that separates the ordered phase from the disordered one , given that on that curve @xmath70 is still zero . for that goal ( exclusively )",
    "we solve , instead of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) , the following system : @xmath91",

    "not too large this noise - induced phase transition is _ reentrant _ as a function of @xmath18 , for @xmath93 ( a fact already known for @xmath45 @xcite ) .",
    "the novelty is that for _ any _ @xmath94 , the phase transition is also reentrant as a function of @xmath34 for @xmath95 ( a feature found in ref .",
    "@xcite for a different system ) .    the multiplicity of mean - field solutions in the ordered region , together with the fact that some of them may suddenly disappear as either @xmath34 or @xmath18 are varied ( a fact that is closely related to the occurrence of anomalous hysteresis ) hinder picking out the right solution in this region .",
    "a more systematic characterization of the aforementioned multiple solutions is achieved when the branch to which they belong is traced from its corresponding `` homogeneous '' ( @xmath75 ) solution .",
    "accordingly , the thin lines in fig .  [ fig:1 ] separate two sectors within the ordered region with regard to the _ homogeneous _ solutions . below them",
    "( `` noise - driven regime '' or ndr ) there is _ a single _ solution with @xmath75 and @xmath96 ( as already suggested , in this regime a solution with @xmath96 _ can _ be stable since it corresponds to shaking violently the pendula ) . above them",

    "note that this line presents a cusp whose meaning was discussed in ref.@xcite , in relation with the character of the hysteresis loop .",
    "we have studied the shape of @xmath27 and the behaviour of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath0 for different locations in this @xmath100 diagram .",
    "the square in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] indicates a position inside the ordered zone for which the shape of the spdf and the hysteresis cycle are followed as functions of @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath92 one ) the evolution of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath4 , for the state indicated by the square in fig.[fig:1 ] ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) .",
    "the spdf is always an _ asymmetric _ function of @xmath76 , indicating a _ spontaneous _ breakdown of parity ( since @xmath104 and @xmath105 remain symmetric ) : the system has to choose between two possible _ asymmetric _ solutions , of which just one is shown . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath27 is _ bimodal _ in the ndr .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , it becomes _ unimodal _",
    "( this is similar to what one achieves by _ decreasing _",

    "the increase of @xmath4 tends to destroy order , and between @xmath106 and @xmath107 there exists a new reentrance with respect to @xmath34 . in this range of @xmath4 , the existence region of the ordered state",

    "@xcitein spite of the fact that both systems are differentshows the robustness of this result .",
    "2 .   regarding the @xmath1 vs @xmath0 plots one sees that as @xmath4 increases the hysteresis cycle becomes more complex , and the range of values of @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath108",
