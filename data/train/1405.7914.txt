    "<S> an important challenge in quantum science is to fully understand the efficiency of energy flow in networks . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple and intuitive explanation for the intriguing observation that optimally efficient networks are not purely quantum , but are assisted by some interaction with a ` noisy ' classical environment . by considering the system s dynamics in both the site - basis and the momentum - basis , we show that the effect of classical noise is to sustain a broad momentum distribution , countering the depletion of high mobility terms which occurs as energy exits from the network . </S>",
    "<S> this picture predicts that the optimal level of classical noise is reciprocally related to the linear dimension of the lattice ; our numerical simulations verify this prediction to high accuracy for regular 1d and 2d networks over a range of sizes up to thousands of sites . </S>",
    "<S> this insight leads to the discovery that dramatic further improvements in performance occur when a driving field targets noise at the low mobility components . </S>",

    "<S> the study of energy transfer in quantum networks is a broad field , ranging from abstract theoretical studies  @xcite through to experimentally observed transport dynamics of real networks , for instance in light - harvesting complexes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important observation is that while a purely quantum mechanical energy transfer process ( i.e.  a quantum random walk ) is inherently faster than the classical equivalent , nevertheless when one measures the efficiency of a network in terms of the time needed for a unit of energy to completely traverse it , then it is optimal to temper the purely quantum dynamics with a degree of classical ` noise ' . </S>",
    "<S> this noise may be , for example , dephasing of the quantum state or a spontaneous hopping process ; in each case the ideal level of noise is non - zero , and for the latter case this has recently been verified for networks of arbitrary topology and sizes up to thousands of sites  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> various explanations for this phenomenon of classically - assisted quantum transport have been discussed  @xcite . in networks with disorder ( e.g. irregularities in the site couplings ) </S>",
    "<S> the quantum state can become localised . </S>",
    "<S> injecting classical noise can break this localisation , as for instance recently experimentally observed in ultra - cold atomic systems on optical lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , classical noise has been found to be advantageous even in perfectly ordered networks . </S>",
    "<S> for such systems it is generally argued that quantum networks suffer from a kind of locking effect , where destructive interference occurs between the different possible pathways to the exit site .    following the notion of invariant subspaces introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , an equivalent statement of this effect is that some of the spatial eigenstates of the system ( which are in general highly non - local ) may have zero amplitude on a given site  </S>",
    "<S> if such a site happened to be the exit , then any part of the initial wavefunction associated with such an eigenstate would never be able to leave the network . </S>",
    "<S> classical noise disrupts such eigenstates , thus alleviating the problem . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will say that a system exhibits `` quantum locking '' if there is a finite probability of energy remaining on the network as @xmath0 ( for zero noise ) .     </S>",
    "<S> some of the regular network topologies considered here : ( a ) linear ( b ) ring , and ( c ) rectangular lattices . </S>",
    "<S> each circle represents a site , i.e.  a molecule or other entity which can be excited by a quantum of energy ; the excitation can hop from one molecule to the nearest neighbouring molecule and leave the network via the exit site . </S>",
    "<S> , width=272 ]    as interesting and intuitive as the quantum locking effect is , nevertheless it is not comprehensive explanation : there are a number of basic cases where classical noise does assist quantum transport , and yet provably there is no quantum locking effect present . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : topologies]a ) is the 1d chain with an exit site at one end and an initial excitation site within the chain  @xcite . as we presently discuss , many examples also exist in the more complicated landscape of 2d networks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore while quantum locking is certainly an important effect , we should continue to seek an explanation for the general phenomenon .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will argue that classically - assisted quantum transport in regular networks is best understood by viewing the dynamics through a combination of the site - basis and the momentum - basis pictures . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by explaining the basic principle , before developing the idea more formally and finally checking the predictions versus intensive numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis in this paper is restricted to the case where there is a single quantum of energy in the network , although we anticipate that our argument translates straightforwardly to multiple energy quanta . </S>",
    "<S> ( we note in passing that in certain photosynthetic systems , the single excitation model is certainly appropriate since fewer than 10 photons are absorbed per molecule per second  @xcite , while the coupling strength of molecules @xmath1 , and thus the transport process is @xmath2 times faster than the absorption process . ) </S>",
    "<S> we identify the site basis with states written as @xmath3 , which corresponds to the energy being definitely located at site @xmath4 , and we will assign the index @xmath5 to the ` exit ' site . </S>",
    "<S> we will presently define the momentum basis as the standard canonical complement to the site basis .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain the process let us first consider a rather contrived model for classical noise : we will subject our quantum system to a periodic series of instantaneous events where the state is completely dephased in the site basis . </S>",
    "<S> we initialise our system by injecting energy at some randomly chosen location , i.e.  we select some random initial state @xmath3 , and there follows a period of evolution before the first dephasing event . </S>",
    "<S> state @xmath3 will of course correspond to a broad superposition of states in the momentum picture . </S>",
    "<S> the components with a high group velocity will rapidly transit the network and will be the first to impinge on the exit site ( to ` hit ' that site in the terminology of random walks ) . </S>",
    "<S> there will then be a finite probability per unit time of the energy exciting the system ; over time if the energy does _ not _ exit , the wavefunction will skew further and further toward lower phase velocity terms . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that this has occurred for some period , and then the first of our classical noise events occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> this dephasing event is equivalent to measuring the system in the site basis , and then forgetting the outcome . in effect </S>",
    "<S> we are reinitialising the system to some state @xmath6 ( although of course this choice is not purely random , since a given site @xmath7 is more likely if it is closer to the original site @xmath4 ) . but </S>",
    "<S> regardless of which @xmath6 we select , the important point is that the momentum distribution is now once again broad and includes elements with a high group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> thus our periodic classical noise process repeatedly reinvigorates , or rejuvenates , the momentum distribution and so counters the skew towards low mobility elements . in - between noise events the high group velocity components </S>",
    "<S> will reach the exit and be removed . </S>",
    "<S> clearly there is some optimal rate of classical noise : if it is too strong , i.e. the frequency of the events is too high , then after one event another will occur before the more rapidly propagating components can exit  this would merely reduce the quantum random walk to a classical one without any advantage . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , too weak a level of classical noise will mean that we miss the opportunity to rejuvenate the momentum distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> this line of thought leads one to conclude that the optimal frequency of the classical noise should depend on the lattice size . in a larger lattice , the high momentum components have further to go to reach the exit , and so a longer period should be allowed between the classical noise events . </S>",
    "<S> one might expect a @xmath8 dependence , where @xmath9 is the linear dimension of the lattice ( so that a square lattice has @xmath10 sites ) . in the following derivation , this form </S>",
    "<S> is indeed predicted , and the prediction is verified to a high degree of accuracy by our numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the transport of energy in a regular network with identical sites can be modelled as ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 + \\mathcal{l}\\rho + \\mathcal{l}_x\\rho ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coherent transport is given by the hamiltonian @xmath13 the noisy classical process is either classical hopping ( ch ) @xmath14 with @xmath15 or pure dephasing ( pd ) @xmath16 and the excitation leaves the network via the exit site-@xmath5 according to the process @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the state of the network , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are ladder operators describing transitions between the ground state @xmath21 and the excited state @xmath22 of the site-@xmath4 , @xmath23 denotes two connected sites , @xmath24 is the coupling strength , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the relative weightings of the quantum and classical processes ( @xmath27 )  @xcite , the constant @xmath28 for one - dimensional chain lattices and two - dimensional square lattices , respectively , and @xmath29 is the strength of the exit coupling from the network . note that we do not need to explicitly include the reaction centres depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we look at the probability that at time @xmath35 the energy quantum has failed to exit the network , @xmath36 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is the ` population ' remaining on the network . in cases where there is no quantum locking all population eventually vanishes ; </S>",

    "<S> moreover , it will always vanish when we have finite classical noise . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we can gauge the transport efficiency , or rather the inefficiency , by finding the average dwelling time in the network which we define as @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> , width=8 ]    for the one - dimensional chain , the average dwelling time for different ch rates @xmath26 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chain](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the average dwelling time is minimized at @xmath43 for the chain with lattice size @xmath44 when we take the exit to be site @xmath9 .    in the single - excitation subspace of the 1d chain , the momentum eigenstate with wave vector @xmath45 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenenergy of the state @xmath50 is @xmath51 , and the corresponding group velocity is @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a wavefunction formed from states in the middle of the band has a high group velocity @xmath53 , while a superposition of states at the edge of the band has a low group velocity @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that at @xmath55 our excitation is at site @xmath4 , then inverting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ momentumbasis ] we see that in the momentum basis the state has a probability of @xmath56 associated with the eigenstate @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the site - localised excitation will have significant population in both the high- and the low - velocity states . </S>",
    "<S> as we have discussed , the higher - velocity components leave the system first , leaving behind an ever more slowly falling population remnant .        </S>",
    "<S> suppose that a finite level of classical hopping ( ch ) is present . even though our noise models ( eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hopeqn ] and [ pdeqn ] ) are continuous , we can map this onto discrete events whereby the excitation is effectively reinitialized during the transport process . for a short time @xmath57 , the state evolves as @xmath58 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the single - excitation subspace , the effect of ch can be expressed as @xmath59 where @xmath60    hence , a ch event @xmath61 corresponds to a measurement of the position of the excitation at site @xmath7 followed by moving the excitation to a randomly chosen neighbouring molecule @xmath4 , i.e. , effectively reinitialising the excitation to one of the neighbouring sites .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of dephasing ( pd ) will have essentially the same effect , of course without the final ` hop ' ; it can be expressed as @xmath62 where @xmath63    thus for both our models of continuous classical noise , we may equivalently think in terms of an occasional reinitialisation process where part of the population in low - velocity states will be promoted to high - velocity states . to optimize the transport efficiency </S>",
    "<S> , the high - velocity component has to leave the network before the next ch or pd event happens . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the optimal level of classical noise @xmath26 decreases with the time required to leave the network , i.e. , the lattice size . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this implies that in the limit @xmath64 , the optimal rate @xmath65 . in other words , for very large ordered lattices </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the classical noise mechanism described here will no longer be advantageous .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chainm ] we show how the momentum distribution @xmath66 evolves over time , starting from a broad initial distribution corresponding to a site eigenstate @xmath3 . for the purely quantum limit </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 one finds that populations in high - velocity states , @xmath67 , vanish much faster than those in low - velocity states , so our initially even distribution becomes highly skewed as time passes . for the pure ch case , </S>",
    "<S> populations with different momenta vanish with almost the same rate , but this rate is much slower than the coherent transport ( note the units of the time axis are ten times greater ) . in the ` best of both worlds ' case </S>",
    "<S> a modest level of classical hopping serves to rejuvenate the distribution , i.e. to keep it relatively even . </S>",
    "<S> the high - velocity components can still escape from the network quite efficiently , while at the same time the lingering wings of the distribution are depleted as we transfer population from low - velocity states to high - velocity states via ch events . as a result , although population in high - velocity states persists for longer than it does in the purely quantum case , nevertheless the overall transport efficiency is increased .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis so far has been presented in terms of the 1d lattice , but the exactly the same argument applies to higher dimensional regular lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we now present the results of numerical simulations which we have performed on 1d and 2d arrays in order to test the predicted @xmath8 scaling of the optimal noise level , where @xmath9 is the linear dimension of the array . to be specific </S>",
    "<S> , we should anticipate that the quantity @xmath68 will scale in this way , according to the following reasoning : the effective rate at which we reinitialise the momentum distribution goes with @xmath69 , but the rate at which the quantum coherent evolution occurs is proportional to @xmath70 , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ generalh ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus the width which the excitation s spatial distribution can reach between reinitialisation events varies with @xmath71 , and we expect that this width should be proportional to the linear lattice size @xmath9 ( and therefore the average distance between a randomly chosen site and the exit site ) . thus we expect to see @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant of proportionality and we have also added an adjustment @xmath74 to allow for finite size effects ( which should be significant only for small arrays ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not predict the specific values of these constants , which will depend for example on the location of the exit site ( corner , edge or internal to the lattice ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that the above expression will be accurately obeyed if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are treated as free fitting parameters . in fig .  [ largesystemsims ] </S>",
    "<S> we display the results of a series of numerical experiments where we test our hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the proposed function does indeed fit the data well . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding fitting parameters and confidence intervals are shown in appendix i.     the optimal classical hopping ( ch ) rate @xmath75 of ( a ) one - dimensional chain lattices and ring lattices with @xmath9 sites , ( b ) two - dimensional square lattices , torus lattices with @xmath76 sites , and rectangle lattices with @xmath77 sites . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal ch rate depends on the position of the exit site . </S>",
    "<S> the exit site is placed at the end on chain lattices and a corner on square and rectangle lattices as examples . </S>",
    "<S> optimal ch rates given by the average remaining population for all possible positions of the exit site are also considered for chain and square lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are obtained by fitting the function @xmath78 , and fitting parameters are shown in table [ fitting ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have supposed that @xmath41 and the energy is initially located at a randomly chosen site . </S>",
    "<S> , width=8 ]    it is worth noting that one can obtain a reasonable estimate of the optimal rate of classical noise merely by applying our simple discretised picture : fully dephasing events occur intermittently , in place of the real continuous noise . we suppose that the single - excitation state evolves coherently , i.e. , @xmath33 , and is completely reinitialized with the period @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> a complete reinitialization reads @xmath80 which means the excitation is initialized at a randomly chosen site . if @xmath38 denotes the population in the network at time @xmath35 when @xmath33 ( i.e.  the green curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chain ] ) , the population after @xmath81 occurrences of the reinitialization event with period @xmath79 is @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , roughly speaking , the population in the network decays with a rate @xmath83 . for the chain with the size @xmath44 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chain ] , we extract a maximum of the decay rate @xmath84 at @xmath85 . comparing the frequency of complete reinitializations with the ch rate , @xmath86 , then this optimal period corresponds to the ch rate @xmath87 , which is remarkably close to the observed optimal ch rate @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> how does the role of noise in overcoming quantum locking compare to its role in this momentum rejuvenation picture ? </S>",
    "<S> we know that quantum locking is a significant effect in many systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example in a regular 2d square array there will always be finite quantum locking in the absence of noise , and therefore the assistance provided by noise is , in part , to remove this locking effect . </S>",
    "<S> however there are also many cases where there is no quantum locking in the zero - noise limit . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations indicate that such cases include the following ( for any location of the initial state and exit , unless otherwise noted ) :    * a 1d array with the exit at one end , and the initial excitation site within the chain . * a 2d array @xmath89 with @xmath90 and the exit in a corner . * </S>",
    "<S> any 2d array with dimensions @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are two different primes . * any 2d array with multiple exit sites forming the perimeter ( shown analytically in appendix ii ) . * any 2d array with ( arbitrarily small ) random perturbations to the coupling strengths or the on - site energies .    </S>",
    "<S> for all these cases we would expect that the momentum rejuvenation picture still applies , since it has no special reliance on symmetries in the system . and </S>",
    "<S> indeed in all these cases we find that there is a finite value of classical noise which optimises the network . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conjecture that the momentum rejuvenation picture is a general explanation for noise - assisted transport in regular arrays ; we see the role of noise in disrupting quantum locking as an important additional factor in many systems .    in support of this view </S>",
    "<S> , we note that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ largesystemsims ] ( b ) contains one instance of a network where locking is present ( the square array ) and one for which it is not ( rectangular with exit on the corner ) . for small networks </S>",
    "<S> we note that the optimal amount of noise is higher for the square lattice compared to the rectangular one . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this is not unexpected since here the noise is advantageous for overcoming the locking effect as well as maintaining a broad momentum distribution .     and the higher excited state @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the hopping coupling , a ` conduction ' band with the width @xmath95 is formed around the energy of the state @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) colour map showing the populations associated with momentum eigenstates @xmath96 on a network with driving fields ; as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chainm ] ( which shares the same colour scale ) , a one - dimensional chain lattice with @xmath44 sites is considered as an example . here , the rabi frequency @xmath97 and the decay rate @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chainm ] shows that the population remaining on the network at time @xmath99 is significantly smaller than for the passive optimal quantum - classical hybrid network ( 0.0024 versus 0.0473 ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> one might ask if the random classical noise from a network s environment is an ideal means of maximising the transport efficiency , or whether other mechanisms might lead to even higher efficiency . according to the picture we have presented </S>",
    "<S> , classical noise effectively rejuvenates the whole momentum distribution indiscriminately </S>",
    "<S> . it would presumably be even more beneficial if one could somehow preferentially rejuvenate the low velocity states , leaving the high velocity state unperturbed . </S>",
    "<S> we now present a simple model showing this is possible when a global driving field is applied .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that each lattice site possesses an additional excited state @xmath94 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chain2ectdrivem ]  ( a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> these higher excited levels form a second excited tier of the network , which will in general experience different hopping strengths @xmath100 . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> let us assume for now that no classical noise is present and that the coupling strength @xmath100 is negligible compared to @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that only @xmath101 is a requirement for the control protocol described here , but the present assumption makes the following argument particularly straightforward . ) as a result , we have purely quantum transport in the lower excited manifold spanned by the @xmath102 levels , governed by the hamiltonian  [ generalh ] with @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath103 be the energy difference between @xmath22 and @xmath94 ; the application of global driving fields with frequencies @xmath104 will then drive transitions between low velocity @xmath22 states [ indicated by red circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chain2ectdrivem ]  ( a ) ] and @xmath94 states . at the same time , high - velocity transitions are detuned and thus suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the driving hamiltonian is given by @xmath105 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the rabi frequency @xmath106 is proportional to the intensity of the applied field , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are ladder operators describing transitions between the state @xmath22 and the state @xmath94 of the site @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the only other process we require is dissipative relaxation from the second excited tier back into the lower excited manifold , e.g.  phonon - assisted transitions which randomise the momentum of the electronic state . </S>",
    "<S> these can be described by the following lindblad superoperator @xmath109 where @xmath84 is the decay rate from the state @xmath94 to the state @xmath22 .    under these circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> the population is preferentially pumped from low - velocity states to the excited state , from which it decays to any momentum state ( as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chain2ectdrivem ]  ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus by targeting the low - velocity state we achieve a much faster transfer ( i.e.  lower population remaining on the network ) than for the optimal quantum - classical hybrid network shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ chainm ]  ( b ) .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we offer an intuitive explanation for the observation that classically - assisted quantum transport can be more efficient than pure quantum evolution , even in systems where quantum locking is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the optimal level of classical noise will scale inversely with the linear dimension of the array , and our numerical simulations have confirmed this behaviour for systems of up to @xmath110 sites . </S>",
    "<S> the picture we have presented is one in which the classical environment acts to continually rejuvenate the momentum distribution of the quantum particle as it traverses the network . </S>",
    "<S> we use this intuition to show that the use of global driving fields can be far more efficient than simple random noise .    </S>",
