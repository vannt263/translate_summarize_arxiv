    "we then introduce the corresponding polymer measure @xmath19 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] for a graphical description ) by @xmath20 where the normalizing constant @xmath21 $ ] is called the _ partition function_.     the polymer measure @xmath22 , for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "we are interested in the case where the interface spacing @xmath26 is allowed to vary with the size @xmath1 of the polymer .",
    "more precisely , we aim at understanding whether and how the asymptotic behavior of the polymer is modified by the interplay between the energetic penalty @xmath27 and the growth rate of @xmath28 as @xmath29 . in the _ attractive case _",
    "@xmath30 , when the polymer is rewarded rather than penalized to touch an interface , this question was answered in depth in a previous paper @xcite , to which we also refer for a detailed discussion on the motivation of the model and for an overview on the literature ( see also  [ sec : slit ] below ) . in the present paper",
    "we extend the analysis to the _ repulsive case _",
    "@xmath25 , showing that the behavior of the model is sensibly different from the attractive case .    for the reader s convenience , and in order to get some intuition on our model , we recall briefly the result obtained in @xcite for @xmath31 .",
    "we first set some notation : given a positive sequence @xmath32 , we write @xmath33 to indicate that , on the one hand , @xmath34 is tight ( for every @xmath35 there exists @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for large @xmath1 ) and , on the other hand , that for some @xmath38 and @xmath39 we have @xmath40 for large @xmath1 .",
    "this notation catches the rate of asymptotic growth of @xmath41 somehow precisely : if @xmath33 and @xmath42 , for some @xmath35 we must have @xmath43 , for large @xmath1 .",
    "theorem  2 in @xcite can be read as follows : for every @xmath44 there exists @xmath45 such that @xmath46 let us give an heuristic explanation for these scalings . for fixed @xmath47 ,",
    "the process @xmath48 under @xmath49 behaves approximately like a time - homogeneous markov process ( for a precise statement in this direction see  [ sec : renewal ] ) .",
    "a quantity of basic interest is the first time @xmath50 at which the polymer visits a neighboring interface .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath31 the typical size of @xmath51 is of order @xmath52 , so that until epoch @xmath1 the polymer will make approximately @xmath53 changes of interface .    assuming that these arguments can be applied",
    "also when @xmath0 varies with @xmath1 , it follows that the process @xmath48 jumps from an interface to a neighboring one a number of times which is approximately @xmath54 . by symmetry",
    ", the probability of jumping to the neighboring upper interface is the same as the probability of jumping to the lower one , hence the last visited interface will be approximately the square root of the number of jumps .",
    "therefore , when @xmath55 , one expects that @xmath41 will be typically of order @xmath56 , which matches perfectly with the first line of . on the other hand , when @xmath57 the polymer will never visit any interface different from the one located at zero and , because of the attractive reward @xmath31 , @xmath41 will be typically at finite distance from this interface , in agreement with the third line of .",
    "finally , when @xmath58 is bounded , the polymer visits a finite number of different interfaces and therefore @xmath41 will be of the same order as @xmath28 , as the second line of shows .      also in the repulsive case @xmath25 one can perform an analogous heuristic analysis .",
    "the big difference with respect to the attractive case is the following : under @xmath59 , the time @xmath51 the polymer needs to jump from an interface to a neighboring one turns out to be typically of order @xmath60 ( see section  [ sec : preliminary ] ) . assuming that these considerations can be applied also to the case when @xmath0 varies with  @xmath1",
    ", we conclude that , under @xmath61 , the total number of jumps from an interface to the neighboring one should be of order @xmath62 .",
    "one can therefore conjecture that if @xmath63 the typical size of @xmath41 should be of order @xmath64 , while if @xmath65 remains bounded one should have @xmath66 .    in the case",
    "@xmath67 , the polymer will never exit the interval @xmath68 .",
    "however , guessing the right scaling in this case requires some care : in fact , due to the repulsive penalty @xmath25 , the polymer will _ not _ remain close to the interface located at zero , as it were for @xmath31 , but it will rather spread in the interval @xmath68 . we are therefore led to distinguish two cases : if @xmath69 then @xmath41 should be of order @xmath28 , while if @xmath70 we should have @xmath71 ( of course we write @xmath72 iff @xmath73 and @xmath74 iff @xmath75 ) .",

    "* we stress that in regimes ( [ part:3 ] ) and ( [ part:4 ] ) the polymer really touches the interface at zero a finite number of times , after which it does not touch any other interface .",
    "it turns out that our model @xmath19 is closely related to a model which has received quite some attention in the recent physical literature , the so - called _ polymer confined between two attractive walls _",
    "@xcite ( also known as polymer in a slit ) .",

    "this problem is considered in @xcite , where the authors obtain some asymptotic expressions for the partition function @xmath147 of a polymer in a slit , in the case of two different rewards / penalties ( we are following their notation , in which @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) and with the boundary condition @xmath152 .",

    "this is linked to the fact that we have gone beyond the first order in the asymptotic development of the free energy @xmath166 , making an additional term of the order @xmath173 appear .",
    "we stress that this new term gives a non - negligible ( in fact , exponentially diverging ! ) contribution as soon as @xmath107 ( @xmath174 in the notation of  @xcite ) .",
