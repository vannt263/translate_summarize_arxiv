    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) relates the correlation function of thermally driven fluctuations in equilibrium with the response of the system to a small external perturbation  @xcite . loosely speaking following onsager ,",

    "an important aspect of nonequilibrium steady states is that detailed balance is broken , which requires permanent dissipation of energy . in the case of driven colloidal systems ,",
    "the heat thus dissipated has been identified as `` housekeeping heat ''  @xcite . since both the housekeeping heat and the violation of the fdt",
    "originate from breaking detailed balance , a deeper connection between these two concepts can be expected  @xcite . since",
    "furthermore the velocity is the crucial quantity entering the housekeeping heat , this connection should become apparent in the violation of the velocity fdt .    in this letter",
    ", we first derive an explicit expression for this violation .",
    "we then demonstrate the restoration of the usual equilibrium form of the velocity fdt  if the velocity fluctuations are properly measured with respect to the _ local _ mean velocity rather than with respect to the _ global _ mean velocity .",
    "our result thus suggests that the decay of fluctuations around the steady state is the same , whether they are spontaneously created or externally induced .",
    "as a paradigm , we study one - dimensional systems with periodicity @xmath0 subject to stochastic dynamics , where the periodicity is necessary to eventually reach a nonequilibrium steady state  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] ) . overdamped diffusive motion is then governed by the langevin equation  @xcite @xmath1 + \\eta(t).\\ ] ] the total force @xmath2 can be split into the gradient of a periodic potential @xmath3 and a non - conservative force @xmath4 , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the force @xmath6 represents a small external perturbation .",
    "the thermal noise @xmath7 has zero mean and correlations @xmath8 . in equilibrium ,",
    "bare mobility @xmath9 , temperature @xmath10 , and diffusion coefficient @xmath11 are connected by the einstein relation @xmath12 with boltzmann s constant set to @xmath13 throughout the paper .",
    "we will keep the einstein relation despite the fact that the system is driven into a nonequilibrium steady state  for @xmath14 , which expresses the assumption that the driving does not affect the heat bath .",

    "in addition , the notion of a local mean velocity @xmath20 will become crucial .",
    "it is given by the drift velocity @xmath21 plus the gradient of the potential @xmath19 .",
    "the local mean velocity @xmath22 can be regarded as a measure of the local violation of detailed balance . after averaging @xmath23^l_0 = \\mu { \\left\\langle f \\right\\rangle } = { \\left\\langle \\dot x \\right\\rangle}\\ ] ]",
    "it becomes the global mean velocity of the particle in a steady state as expected .",
    "the boundary term vanishes due to the periodicity of the system .",
    "a small probing force @xmath24 is applied after the system has been prepared in a steady state described by the stationary probability @xmath25 . the linear response of any observable @xmath26 to this perturbation",
    "is defined as @xmath27 which depends only on the time difference @xmath28 . due to causality",
    "the response function is zero for @xmath29 and in what follows we always take @xmath30 .",
    "we distinguish averages @xmath31 in the equilibrium system ( @xmath32 ) , averages @xmath15 in the unperturbed system in a nonequilibrium steady state , and averages @xmath33 in the perturbed system ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the various fluctuation - dissipation relations state that the response function of an observable is not independent of its correlations .",
    "in particular , in equilibrium the well - known fdt@xmath35 relates the response function of @xmath26 to the correlations of this observable with a unique observable @xmath36 conjugated to @xmath6 with respect to energy .",
    "however , even in a nonequilibrium steady state  the less known fluctuation - dissipation relation@xmath37 correlates the observable @xmath26 to the gradient of the generalized potential @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "similar relations have been discussed also for chaotic systems  @xcite . a third relation involving the noise",
    "can be derived from the gaussian weight @xmath38 \\sim \\exp\\left\\ { -\\frac{1}{4d}{\\int_{t_0}^{t}{\\mathrm{d}}\\tau\\;}\\eta^2(\\tau )    \\right\\}\\ ] ] of the noise trajectory @xmath39 in the time interval @xmath40 . since @xmath41 can formally be expressed as a functional @xmath42 $ ] of the noise history and variation with respect to @xmath43 is equivalent to a variation of @xmath39 in eq .  , we have @xmath44}{\\delta \\eta(\\tau ) } } \\right\\rangle }    = d{\\int[{\\mathrm{d}}\\eta]\\;}{\\frac{\\delta { \\mathcal a}[\\eta]}{\\delta \\eta(\\tau)}}{\\mathcal p}[\\eta ]    = -d{\\int[{\\mathrm{d}}\\eta]\\;}{\\mathcal a}[\\eta]{\\frac{\\delta { \\mathcal p}[\\eta]}{\\delta \\eta(\\tau ) } }    = \\frac{1}{2}{\\left\\langle a(x(t))\\eta(\\tau ) \\right\\rangle}\\ ] ] through functional integration by parts  @xcite .",
    "because we are interested in the velocity , a fluctuation - dissipation relation  involving @xmath45 instead of the potential @xmath19 in eq .",
    "is called for . to this end",
    "we insert the langevin equation   with the force replaced by the local mean velocity   into eq .  .",
    "in the resulting expression @xmath46 we use eq .   for the noise term and obtain @xmath47 holding in a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "first , we consider the equilibrium case where the position @xmath48 and the probing force @xmath6 are conjugate .",
    "setting @xmath49 we obtain from eq .",
    "@xmath50 the usual form of the fdt for velocities .",
    "we can interchange the order of time derivative and taking the average since the probability distribution implicit in the brackets is time - independent .    in a nonequilibrium steady state",
    ", we consequently use eq .   instead of the fdt  , leading to @xmath51",
    "a somewhat related expression has been derived by a different approach in ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing eq .   to the equilibrium form",
    "we identify @xmath52 as the violation of the fdt  and define a normalized violation function @xmath53[{\\nu_\\mathrm{s}}(x(\\tau))-{v_\\mathrm{s } } ] \\right\\rangle }    = { \\left\\langle \\dot x(t){\\nu_\\mathrm{s}}(x(\\tau ) ) \\right\\rangle } - { v_\\mathrm{s}}^2\\ ] ] such that @xmath54 .",
    "our crucial observation is that the equilibrium form can be restored even in a nonequilibrium steady state  when we consider the _ relative _ velocity @xmath55 combining eq .   and eq .  , we obtain @xmath56 this is the main claim of the present letter .",
    "physically this relation implies that fluctuations of the velocity relative to the local mean velocity in a nonequilibrium steady state  behave like the corresponding response function . in this sense",
    ", these fluctuations can not be distinguished from equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "in a nonequilibrium steady state , the heat permanently dissipated in order to maintain the violation of detailed balance is called the housekeeping heat  @xcite . in the time interval @xmath40 it is given as the functional @xmath57 \\equiv \\mu^{-1}{\\int_{t_0}^{t}{\\mathrm{d}}\\tau\\ ; } \\dot x(\\tau){\\nu_\\mathrm{s}}(x(\\tau))\\ ] ] along a single stochastic trajectory @xmath58 . by comparing this expression with eq .",
    ", a connection between energy dissipation and the violation of the fdt  for the velocity becomes obvious .",
    "indeed , in ref .  @xcite we calculated the mean dissipation rate as @xmath59 which is constant in a nonequilibrium steady state . for large time differences",
    "we get @xmath60 since @xmath61 , it follows that the violation of the fdt is bounded by the energy dissipation rate , @xmath62 where the equal sign holds for @xmath63 .",
    "this inequality specializes the former derivation of a general upper bound for the fdt violation  @xcite to the present case of a driven colloidal particle .",
    "it is interesting to note that we can equate the left hand side of eq .   involving two different times with the mean dissipation rate @xmath64 by taking into account the change of the generalized potential @xmath65 during the time @xmath28 . with @xmath66",
    "we see that @xmath67 holds .",
    "since in a nonequilibrium steady state  the total heat flow into the heat reservoir is @xmath68  @xcite , the term @xmath69 can be regarded as `` excess heat '' exchanged with the reservoir in addition to the housekeeping heat . its mean value @xmath70 vanishes and it is bounded , whereas @xmath71 increases in time on average .",
    "a direct experimental test of the violated or restored fdt , eqs .   or   respectively , will certainly be a challenge .",
    "we therefore suggest first to test an integrated version involving the effective diffusion coefficient . as a transport coefficient",
    ", it is related to velocity correlations by the green - kubo formula @xmath72[\\dot x(0)-{v_\\mathrm{s } } ] \\right\\rangle}.\\ ] ] inserting eq",
    ".   leads to @xmath73 where the first term on the right hand side is the static susceptibility @xmath74 and the second term the integral over the normalized violation function @xmath75 .",
    "all three quantities appearing in eq .   can be measured independently .    for a numerical check ,",
    "we calculate the mean velocity in eq .   as @xmath76}{{\\int_{0}^{l}{\\mathrm{d}}x\\ ; } i_+(x)/l } ,    \\quad    i_\\pm(x ) \\equiv    \\frac{1}{d}{\\int_{0}^{l}{\\mathrm{d}}z\\;}\\exp\\left\\{\\pm[u(x)-u(x\\mp z)]/t\\right\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 and the effective diffusion coefficient as @xmath78^{-3 }    { \\int_{0}^{l}{\\mathrm{d}}x\\ ; } i_+^2(x)i_-(x),\\ ] ] where now @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the violation function @xmath75 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] is calculated from simulated langevin trajectories . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] , we compare the known expression   with the numerical results obtained from eq .   with excellent agreement .",
    "although we discuss in this letter the one - dimensional case , following our route it is clear how to generalize eq .   to interacting systems with more than one degree of freedom .",
    "furthermore , eq .   remains valid even if we drop the restriction of the einstein relation in favor of an `` effective '' temperature @xmath79 , where the strength of the noise @xmath80 depends on the driving .",
    "whether our approach to restore a fdt by referring the velocity to the appropriate local mean velocity can be extended to non - velocity like observables involved in violations of fdt s remains to be seen ."
