    "motivated by a diverse array of applications in automotive industry , railway vehicles , and networked control , the recent works @xcite dealt in detail with the concept of _ maximum hands - off control_. the purpose of maximum hands - off control is to design actuator signals which are most often zero , but nonetheless achieve given control objectives .",

    "<S> numerical example illustrates that adopting an @xmath0 cost leads to a sparse control , whereas an @xmath1-relaxation in singular problems leads to a non - sparse solution .    2 </S>"
