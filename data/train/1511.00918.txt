    "confinement of fluid in a small pore significantly alters the fluid s thermodynamic properties . here",
    "we focus on the fluid compressibility , which is one of the key parameters governing the mechanical properties of fluid - saturated porous materials .",
    "for example , the knowledge of the compressibility of a fluid in the nanopores is necessary for predicting the flow of hydrocarbons in tight geological formations such as shale gas .",
    "recent studies in characterization of shales show that they typically have a substantial amount of pores that are only a few nanometers wide ( mesopores ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , a fundamental understanding of the effect of nano - confinement on fluid properties , such as the compressibility , is of major importance in the development of modern petroleum extraction techniques .",
    "in addition , as we show here , the dependence of fluid compressibility on pore size may be the basis for a new method for experimentally determining pore sizes .",
    "the compressibility of a fluid confined in the nanopores can be determined experimentally from measurements of the speed of sound propagation through a saturated porous sample .",
    "such experiments for argon and hexane in the pores of vycor glass show that the fluid compressibility is affected by the laplace pressure in the pores  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been recently confirmed by calculations based on macroscopic thermodynamics and classical density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the calculations from ref .",
    "predict that compressibility of the fluid confined in the pore linearly decreases with decreasing pore size . however , these results are based on macroscopic theories and , therefore , applying them to the pores below ca .  10  nm in size is questionable .",
    "here we calculate the compressibility of a confined fluid as a function of pore size without exploiting any macroscopic assumptions .",
    "we use conventional grand - canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations  @xcite to calculate the compressibility of lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid argon in silica pores from the fluctuations of number of particles .",
    "since conventional gcmc is known to be inefficient for dense fluids  @xcite , we also perform simulations using the grand - canonical transition - matrix monte carlo method ( gc - tmmc )  @xcite .",
    "argon was chosen for two reasons : it is simple to model , since a lj pair potential model accurately captures its relevant interactions and geometry , and it is widely used in physisorption experiments for characterization of porous materials  @xcite .",
    "both methods confirm the linear relation between the compressibility and the pore size from ref .   in the range of the pore sizes from 2.5  nm to 6.0  nm .",
    "our results provide a simple linear relation between the confined fluid compressibility and the pore size .",
    "the compressibility can be calculated from the speed of sound measured in ultrasonic experiments , and therefore , our study provides a theoretical framework for determination of pore sizes from ultrasonic experiments on fluid saturated samples .",
    "such measurement can be used as a way to get the pore size distribution of a sample , alternatively to the conventional method based on the adsorption isotherm  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on calculations of the isothermal compressibility @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the volume of the pore , @xmath3 is the fluid pressure , and @xmath4 is the absolute temperature . when the fluid is confined in a nanopore , the interaction with confining walls may introduce anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the system , so that instead of a single scalar pressure value one has to introduce a pressure tensor , and it may vary as a function of position relative to the pore wall . this pressure tensor for the simple fluids in the nanopores",
    "can be calculated using asymptotic theories @xcite or molecular simulations @xcite .",
    "one could also introduce a spatially - dependent compressibility tensor , defined similarly to eq .",
    "[ beta - def ] , but using components of the pressure tensor .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the anisotropy and heterogeneity of the fluid compressibility in the pore can be measured by ultrasonic experiments .",
    "instead , we calculate the scalar compressibility for the fluid in the pore as a whole , which is likely to represent the experimentally observable , average macroscopic value .",
    "note that our calculation of the compressibility does not require the calculation of pressure .",
    "classical statistical mechanics allows the calculation of the compressibility of the fluid @xmath0 from the fluctuations of number of particles in the pore @xmath5 in the grand - canonical ensemble  @xcite through the relation @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is boltzmann s constant .",

    "[ beta - fluct ] is valid when the fluctuations are normally distributed  @xcite . in the grand - canonical ensemble the fluid atoms or molecules in the pore",
    "are assumed to be in equilibrium with a reservoir , and the pressure @xmath9 in the reservoir is directly related to the chemical potential @xmath10 . in a typical adsorption experiment",
    "the reservoir contains gas phase and the pressure @xmath9 in the gas phase , is different from the pressure in the adsorbed phase @xmath3 .",
    "we modeled argon at its normal boiling point @xmath11  k in spherical silica pores of different sizes .",
    "we began by performing conventional gcmc simulations  @xcite , based on the metropolis algorithm  @xcite .",

    "the gc - tmmc method has been described in detail by errington and coworkers  @xcite and has been specifically discussed in the context of gas adsorption in porous materials  @xcite .",
    "here we use an implementation of gc - tmmc identical to that in ref .  , except that the simulations were initialized using the wang - landau algorithm to pre - fill the tmmc collection matrix  @xcite .",

    "the physical reason for this dependence is straightforward : the attractive walls lead to formation of fluid layers with high density near them .",
    "these dense layers have been observed recently for water adsorption in silica pores by combination of _ in situ _ x - ray and neutron scattering @xcite . for small pores",
    "these layers contribute significantly to the average density of the confined fluid , so that it becomes noticeably higher than the bulk density at the same chemical potential .",
    "since the liquid compressibility has a strong inverse dependence on density , the confined fluid has lower compressibility than bulk .",
    "also , the calculation of pressure in confined fluids shows that even at saturation ( @xmath48 ) , the pressure @xmath3 in the fluid is @xmath49  @xcite , so that a confined fluid is effectively under compression due to the attraction of the pore walls . obviously , the confined fluid , which is already `` compressed '' at a high pressure @xmath3 , has lower compressibility then the one which has not been compressed , i.e. the bulk .",
    "our molecular simulations go beyond this qualitative conclusion , and can provide quantitative values of compressibility for a fluid confined in pores of different sizes .",
    "the methods we use here were verified previously for predicting thermodynamic properties of confined fluids , and as we have shown here , in the limit of large pores they give fluid compressibility values that are in good agreement with published bulk data .    in this work we present compressibility predictions for lj argon in mesopores with diameters ranging from 2.5  nm to 5.0  nm ( gc - tmmc ) or 6.0  nm ( gcmc ) . for pores larger than that ,",
    "both methods become too computationally expensive .",

    "[ fig - gcmc ] leads to an intersection with the bulk horizontal line at 9.0  nm ( gcmc ) or 8.8  nm ( gc - tmmc ) .",
    "it is likely that for pore sizes larger than that , the compressibility will be close to the bulk value . for pores smaller than 2.5",
    "nm both gcmc and gc - tmmc methods give particle number distributions that are essentially non - gaussian .",
    "therefore , eq .  [ beta - fluct ] for calculation of compressibility is not applicable .",
    "moreover , the use of a macroscopic concept of compressibility for such small systems ( @xmath50 ) is questionable .",
    "note that as fig .",
    "[ fig - pressure ] shows , for all the pore sizes considered calculations based on the macroscopic expression in eq .",
    "[ beta - bulk ] are in excellent agreement with the result from eq .",
    "[ beta - fluct ] , which do not use any macroscopic assumptions .",
    "this agreement shows that the gibbs - duhem equation ( eq .  [ gibbs - duhem ] ) remains valid even for a pore as small as of 2.5  nm diameter , which has @xmath51 .",
    "we do not present a direct comparison to experimental data , because to our knowledge there has been no systematic study of the compressibility of confined argon in pores of different sizes .",
    "such a study seems feasible , since the method for calculation of the compressibility of confined fluids from ultrasonic experiments is well - developed  @xcite . note that for direct comparison between compressibility data obtained from simulation and ultrasonic experiment , one has to take into account that the former is an isothermal process while the latter is adiabatic , described in terms of adiabatic compressibility @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the heat capacity ratio of the fluid @xmath54 .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 is not sensitive to pressure  @xcite , and consequently , @xmath53 for a confined fluid should not be much different from the bulk .",
    "therefore , following  @xcite for comparison of the presented data to the experimental data from ultrasonic experiments one can use @xmath55 for bulk liquid argon from ref .  .    a relation between an experimentally - measurable thermodynamic property of a fluid in the pore and the pore size can be used for determination the latter",
    "a conventional adsorption experiment in a mesopore is a typical example : measuring the values of gas pressures at which the capillary condensation and evaporation in a porous material take place allows one to estimate the pore size and even to calculate the pore - size distribution ( psd ) .",
    "this is the basis of porosimetry via the classical barrett - joyner - halenda ( bjh ) method  @xcite and more advanced methods based on classical dft  @xcite .",
    "we propose that the unambiguous relation between the fluid compressibility and the pore size we have calculated can also be used as a basis for a method to estimate of the pore sizes of fluid - filled nanoporous samples from the ultrasonic experiments .",
    "such a method would be different from the ultrasonic methods proposed before by dukhin et al .",
    "@xcite and by warner and beamish  @xcite .",
    "the former is based on the measurement of seismoelectric current and provides the information on the psd in the macropore ( @xmath56  nm ) regime ; the latter measures the _ mass _ of the adsorbed fluid .",
    "therefore , our study provides the first critical steps toward an application of technological relevance , offering a basis for a totally new approach for determination of pore sizes of nanoporous materials .",
    "one particular advantage of our proposed method for ultrasonic porosimetry is that it can be done _ in situ _ , allowing pore size determination in a wide range of working fluids and experimental conditions .",
    "the physical reason for the relation between compressibility and pore size is not specific to lj interactions .",
    "we expect that a similar relation can be observed for more complex systems , e.g. ,  confined water , carbon dioxide or hydrocarbons , which are attracting much practical interest  @xcite .",
    "consequently , our study sheds light beyond the proposed technological application , enhancing our fundamental understanding of the properties of nano - confined fluids .",
    "to summarize , when a fluid is confined to a nanopore , its thermodynamic properties differ from the properties of a bulk fluid .",
