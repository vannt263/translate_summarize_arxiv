    "in the hierarchical model of galaxy formation , quasar activities are related to the mergers of galaxies ( e.g. , toomre 1977 ; hernquist 1989 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ) . during the merging processes , tidal torque drives gas inflows into the inner region of galaxies , forming starbursts and igniting the central smbhs ( e.g. , hernquist 1989 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ; springel et al . 2005 ) .",

    "the typical duty cycle time is @xmath141years , indicating that the smbhs are undergoing many episodes ( martini 2004 ; wang et al . 2006 ; 2008 ; 2009 ) .",
    "the lifetime of quasars is longer at higher redshift .",
    "this should be due to the increase of merger rates and the mounting importance of major mergers with increasing redshift .",
    "major mergers provide more abundant gas , and thus drive smbh activities to live longer than minor mergers .",
    "we also calculate the luminosity - averaged duty cycle time in figure 3(b ) , and simply fit its relation to redshift as @xmath142 the evolution of the duty cycle time should be independently examined by future observational data , for example from the clustering measurements of quasars ( for a review see martini 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , a more realistic model of the quasar lifetime and light curve ( hopkins et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins & hernquist 2009b ) is worth considering in a future paper .",

    "bonoli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also find similar behaviors from semi - analytically modeling quasar lfs coupled with numerical simulations .",
    "the over - estimate for the bright tail is because most of the galaxies are gas - poor ( dry mergers , see lin et al .",
    "2008 ) and some fraction of ( low - level ) quasar activities may be stochastical accretion - driven ( hopkins & hernquist 2006 ) .",
    "this naturally drives an underestimate of quasars for the faint tail regarding passive evolution of galaxies after @xmath144 ( faber et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "major mergers are undoubtedly taking place in very luminous submillimeter galaxies at @xmath145 ( tacconi et al . 2006 ; 2008 ) .",
    "detailed studies from spectroscopic imaging survey in the near - infrared with sinfoni ( sins ) of high redshift galaxies ( @xmath146 ) show that about one third of the galaxies are rotation - dominated rings / disks undergoing star formations , another one third are compact and velocity dispersion - dominated objects , and the remaining are clearly interacting / merging systems ( genzel et al .",
    "2008 ; frster schreiber et al .",
    "it appears that rapid and continuous gas accretion via `` cold flows '' and/or minor mergers are playing an important role in driving star formation and the assembly of star forming galaxies ( genzel et al . 2008 ) .",
    "based on morphologies of x - ray selected agns with redshifts @xmath147 , georgakakis et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested that agns in disk galaxies are likely fueled by minor mergers .",
    "more interestingly , robaina et al . (",
    "2009 ) reported that only less than @xmath148 of star formation in massive galaxies for @xmath149 is triggered by major interaction .",
    "these pieces of independent evidence are consistent with the change of the major merger fraction as shown in figure 2_b_.    the importance of minor mergers in triggering smbh activities has been realized by many authors ( e.g. , de robertis et al . 1998 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ; taniguchi 1999 ; kendall et al .",
    "2003 ; hopkins & hernquist 2009a ) .",
    "the dynamical studies of minor mergers find that the merging satellites retain memory of the initial random orientations when arriving at the nucleus of the primary galaxy ( kendall et al .",
    "we therefore may infer that during a succession of minor mergers , gas fueling to the central smbh will carry on in a manner with stochastical orientations relative to the host galactic plane .",
    "this affords a natural explanation of random accretion proposed by king & pringle ( 2006 ; 2007 ) , as one fueling scenario to agns .",
    "there are several independent indications for minor mergers as a triggering mechanism of random accretion .",
    "first , radio jets in a sample of nearby seyfert galaxies ( @xmath150 ) have a random orientation with respect to their host galactic plane ( kinney et al .",
    "presumably , the jet direction aligns with the axis of the accretion disk , therefore the fueling gas to the smbhs could _ not _ be supplied from their host galaxies directly ( see a brief review of fueling mechanisms of smbhs in taniguchi 1999 ) , but probably from minor mergers ( king & pringle 2007 ) .",
    "second , agn types are independent of orientations of their host galaxies ( keel 1980 ; dahari & de robertis 1988 ; munoz marin et al .",
    "additionally , the orientations of extended [ o iii ] emission in some nearby seyfert galaxies have no correlation with the major axis of the host galaxies ( schmitt et al .",
    "this suggests that the dusty torus axis is not aligned with the host galaxy rotation axis .",
    "third , w09 derived an @xmath9-equation to describe cosmological evolution of radiative efficiency of accretion into smbhs , based on the argument that the smbh growth is dominated by baryon accretion ( soltan 1982 ) .",
    "applying the equation into existing survey data of quasars and galaxies , they report that the radiative efficiency strongly evolves with redshift , with values of @xmath10 at @xmath3 and @xmath11 at @xmath5 . as described below , episodic random accretion definitely leads to a decrease of spin for smbhs .",
    "presumably , with the link between radiative efficiency and smbh spin ( thorne 1974 ) , this trend clearly supports the cosmological evolution of mergers from major at high-@xmath8 to minor at low-@xmath8 found from our model of quasars lfs .    with the above comprehensive indications and the results obtained in our model of quasar lfs",
    ", it quite appears that minor mergers may mainly be driving smbh activities after @xmath151 , and random accretion driven by minor mergers supplies shining power of the quasars .      during the active phases of a quasar ,",
    "the smbh accretes a significant amount of gas to buildup its mass ( the soltan s argument ; see also yu & tremaine 2002 ; volonteri et al .",
    "the previous studies using hierarchical merger tree found that mass accretion also plays a dominant role in determining spin evolution of black holes compared with coalescence ( volonteri et al .",
    "2005 ; berti & volonteri 2008 ) . however , the detailed spin distribution of black holes depends on the specific accretion scenarios : prolonged or random accretion . in prolonged accretion ,",
    "the material keeps constant sign of angular momentum . in this case ,",
    "an initially nonrotating black hole that accretes about one - third of its mass will end up very fast spinning ( thorne 1974 ) . by contrast , random accretion rapidly spins down black holes ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) . on the other hand , in a major coalescence some orbital angular momentum of a black hole binary",
    "may be converted to the spin of the newly formed black hole .",
    "this most likely yields a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "as mentioned above , random accretion can be naturally interpreted through stochastically - oriented minor mergers ( kendall et al .",
    "we have shown that minor mergers become important in driving smbh activities toward low redshifts .",
    "then we can estimate spin evolution of smbhs due to random accretion induced by minor mergers .",
    "for an approximation , we apply the equation @xmath152 ( equation ( 26 ) in hughes & blandford 2003 , for random captures of minor black holes originally ) . here",

    "the lifetime of a single activity can be inferred from the proximity effect , @xmath1611 myr ( kirkman & tytler 2008 ) . for @xmath162",
    ", we apply @xmath163yr and then obtain the order of magnitude estimate @xmath164 . to satisfy the ratio of smbh mass and halo mass in equation ( 6 ) , the mass growth of smbhs due to accretion during each merger is",
    "( see also volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the average mass ratio of two merging galaxies / halos .",
    "the total mass growth during a hubble time is thus @xmath167 where @xmath72 and we set @xmath168 for minor mergers .",
    "consequently , the spin of the black hole drops off by a factor of @xmath169 from @xmath162 to @xmath170 .",
    "this is generally consistent with the results found by berti & volonteri ( 2008 ) that random accretion predicts the spin distribution with @xmath171 .",
    "we may suggest a picture that at high redshift @xmath3 , the newly formed smbhs from major mergers acquire a rapid spin due to the orbital angular momentum of the merging holes , and subsequently random accretion led by minor mergers may rapidly spin them down .",
    "it is interesting to note that king et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposed a scenario that self - gravity of a accretion disk can give rise to a long series of episodic activities during a major merger event .",
