    "with its launch in 1983 , the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( @xmath9 ) opened up a new wavelength window and enabled identification of many classes of stellar sources with circumstellar material , providing new insights into star formation and evolution . in one of the most exciting discoveries enabled by @xmath9",
    ", @xcite reported the first detection of an infrared excess owing to dust in the vega system , and this excess was later explained as a debris disk . to date , many debris disks have been found with _ iras _ , the _ infrared space observatory _ _ ( iso ) _ , and the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( _ spitzer _ ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most known debris disks show evidence of cool dust at wavelengths @xmath8 20 @xmath0 m , and the majority of these surround intermediate - mass stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "only two @xmath9 point source catalog debris disk sources , the intermediate - mass a - type stars @xmath10 pictoris and @xmath11 leporis , exhibited a mid - ir ( @xmath12 12 @xmath0 m ) excess detectable by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 observations of @xmath9-discovered debris disks indicate that most are devoid of warm dust and small particles ( sizes @xmath7 10 @xmath0 m ) @xcite .",
    "the rarity of mid - ir excess sources may imply that dust particles emitting at terrestrial temperatures are uncommon around main - sequence stars .",
    "advances in infrared technologies coupled with large - aperture ground - based telescopes and @xmath14 mid - ir sensitivity with irac enable new searches for warm / hot circumstellar dust that @xmath9 did not detect .",
    "even with such improvements in sensitivity over @xmath9 , only five known intermediate - mass stars ( hd 3003 , hd 38678 , hd 75416 , hd 105234 , and hd 181296 ) are surrounded by debris disks with temperatures analogous to our asteroid belt ( @xmath8 200 k ) ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . @xmath13 observations have also revealed a number of mid - ir excess objects that are primordial disks undergoing disk clearing processes similar to the solar - mass star tw hya ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "`` transition disks '' may be evolved protoplanetary disks with inner holes caused by clearing of the initial gas - dominated disks from the inside out @xcite .",
    "these disks would be optically thin at near- and mid - ir wavelengths and optically thick in the far - ir",
    ". these sources would show weak to no accretion signatures @xcite .",
    "intermediate - mass candidate transition disks have only recently been discovered ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such transition disks are especially interesting as possible evolutionary links between the optically thick herbig aebe disk systems and the older optically thin debris disk systems .    in @xcite we exploited this new mid - ir capability and used @xmath13 to identify stars with 8 @xmath0 m infrared excesses . in @xcite , we identified 230 stars that exhibited 8 @xmath0 m mid - ir excesses out of 4,015 stars investigated in the _ spitzer _ galactic legacy infrared midplane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ; @xcite ) and midcourse space experiment ( _ msx _ ; @xcite ) catalogs . out of the 230 stars with 8 @xmath0 m excesses ,",
    "183 are of spectral types o or early b. the excess for these stars is plausibly explained by free - free emission . out of the 47 remaining stars of spectral types b8 or later , five stars were shown to be false excess sources , and three sources were not yet confirmed at 24 @xmath0 m @xcite . in systems with mid - ir excesses we modeled the 8 and 24 @xmath0 m excesses as simple blackbodies to characterize the color temperature and fractional infrared luminosity of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the results were consistent with massive debris disks and/or transitional disks with disk temperatures ranging between @xmath15200800  k and fractional infrared luminosities ( @xmath3 ) @xmath1510@xmath1610@xmath17 .",
    "however , infrared photometry alone is not sufficient to unambiguously determine the nature of the extraphotospheric emission in these sources .",
    "because of their scarcity , identifying new transition disks and warm debris disks is an important step toward understanding the evolutionary path of circumstellar disks .",
    "the nature of the mid - ir excesses emanating from circumstellar disks around intermediate - mass stars ( 28  ) varies greatly and partially depends on age @xcite .",
    "young stars form circumstellar disks through the collapse of the initial molecular cloud as a method to conserve angular momentum @xcite .",
    "intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence herbig aebe stars accrete gaseous material via their circumstellar disks as they evolve towards main - sequence stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "circumstellar dust disks , presumably due to planetesimal collisions , surround some main - sequence stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "circumstellar gaseous disks that emit excesses owing to free - free emission surround other main - sequence stars during late main - sequence or post - main - sequence evolution and are known as classical be stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "circumstellar disks can surround evolved giants as well ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by understanding the nature of the circumstellar disks",
    ", we can better understand how these disks evolve .",
    "the two most common stellar contaminants in surveys for stars with debris disks are herbig aebe stars and classical be stars .",
    "herbig aebe stars are young stars accreting circumstellar material via their disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "emission lines and near - infrared excesses evidence this accretion @xcite . @xcite",
    "suggest the following as criteria for herbig aebe stars : ( 1 ) an emission - line a or b star , ( 2 ) an infrared excess owing to circumstellar dust , either hot or cool , and ( 3 ) luminosity class iii  v . as the primordial disk dissipates the emission lines weaken and the infrared excess decreases , appearing only at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "classical be stars are typically rapidly rotating b stars with h@xmath1 emission and an ir excess from free - free emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these stars are variable in both emission - line strength and luminosity @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar disks for classical be stars are thought to be mechanisms for mass loss , unlike herbig aebe circumstellar disks which facilitate accretion @xcite .",
    "classical be stars are similar to herbig aebe stars in that they both exhibit emission lines due to circumstellar gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the greatest distinction between herbig aebe stars and classical be stars is the nature of the infrared excess ",
    "dust in the former and thermal bremsstrahlung in the latter .    in this paper",
    "we present results of optical spectroscopic analysis for 30 mid - ir excess sources identified in the _ spitzer _ glimpse and @xmath18 catalogs to determine the nature of infrared excess @xcite . by investigating the nature of the infrared excess through optical spectral features",
    ", we can distinguish between various types of circumstellar disks that persist around intermediate - mass stars .",
    "our goal is to remove classical be and herbig aebe stars from our sample to identify transition and warm debris disk candidates . in ",
    "2 we describe how we obtained new optical echelle spectroscopy .",
    "we discuss the results of our rotational velocity analysis in  3 . in  4 we present our methods for determining effective temperatures . in  5 we discuss the spectra including the h@xmath1 , @xmath19 5317  , paschen , , and ir triplet line profiles and any implications on the nature of the disk from the lines .",
    "we describe how we estimate stellar ages through main - sequence fitting utilizing our determined fundamental parameters in  6 . in  7 we discuss how all of the derived parameters provide insight into the nature of the infrared excess , how we use these parameters to estimate the contribution of free - free emission associated with our sources , and how we draw conclusions regarding the evolutionary state of the circumstellar disk . in  8 we describe the individual sources and classify the infrared excesses .",
    "finally we use spectral classification schemes for stars with infrared excesses , such as classical be stars , with our stars to determine if the classifications are consistent in  9 .",
    "we also apply our classification schemes to well - known stellar samples to determine their classification in  9 .",
    "we observed 30 of 42 stellar sources that exhibited an 8 @xmath0 m mid - ir excess in @xcite , 25 of which have an excess at 8 and 20 + @xmath0 m .",
    "the purpose of these observations was to identify circumstellar disk characteristics ( e.g. , balmer emission , metallic emission , forbidden - line emission ) , and stellar classification features ( e.g , , and absorption ) based on optical spectral features to determine stellar and circumstellar properties .",
    "we chose stars with both known and unknown circumstellar evolutionary state .",
    "we conducted high - resolution , high - signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopic observations at the magellan telescope with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ; @xcite ) double echelle spectrograph on the nights of 2628 september 2006 and 78 april 2007 .",
    "the spectral coverage was @xmath434009500   with a resolving power of r=37,000 at 4000   and r=29,000 at 6500  measured from arc spectra .",
    "the typical s / n was @xmath4100:1 in the stellar continuum .",
    "we conducted standard data reductions in iraf including flat fielding with a continuum lamp and wavelength calibration using a thar arc lamp , but no flux calibration was applied .",
    "we also observed 13 stars to use as rotational velocity standards listed below the solid horizontal line in table  [ trot ] .",
    "these stars were used to validate our technique and compare our determined values to those in the literature .",
    "seven of these stars had projected rotational velocities determined in @xcite .",
    "ten of these stars had projected rotational velocities determined in @xcite .",
    "four stars had their rotational velocities determined in both papers and provide a direct comparison between the two techniques .",
    "we will discuss these stars further in  3 .",
    "the most common methods for measuring the projected rotational velocities are through the computation of the first zero of a fourier transform of a given line profile ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or through the measurement of a line full width half maximum ( fwhm ) @xcite .",

    "this method is less reliable at lower rotational velocities because of the non - linearity of the fwhm / projected rotational velocity relationship , and the calibration of @xcite has been shown to be 1012@xmath20 lower than measurements made using the fourier transform @xcite . in order to improve upon existing linear relations between",

    "we did not confirm the infrared excess at 24 @xmath0 m in one case . in the remaining nine cases ( type ii sources ) the expected contribution from free - free emission can not account for all of the observed ir excess , implying that either 1 ) the circumstellar excess is time - variable and the non - contemporaneous nature of h@xmath1 and mid - ir data render this estimate invalid , or 2 ) there is a dust component to the ir excess .",
    "the lack of evidence for h@xmath1 variability for the majority of our sources , combined with the fact that in no instance does the h@xmath1 _ over predict _ the ir excess component , makes the first scenario unlikely .",
    "we conclude that the second scenario , the presence of a circumstellar dust component , is most probable . combining correlations of spectral features for sources with known characteristics",
    "we find that the nine type ii sources with ir excesses require a dust component and are likely to be young main - sequence or near main - sequence objects harboring warm ( 300800 k ) circumstellar dust .",
    "the nominal fractional infrared luminosities for these nine sources after removal of the free - free component is @xmath410@xmath1710@xmath5 .",
    "for the six of these nine sources with age estimates , there is a correlation between estimated age and h@xmath1 ew consistent with a progression of disk clearing with time .",
    "such characteristics make these stars candidates for being `` transition disk '' or `` evolved - haebe '' systems containing rare dissipating primordial gas and dust disks .",
    "one of the four systems lacking h@xmath1 emission has a very large @xmath6-[24 ] color , @xmath8 4 magnitudes .",
    "such a large color difference implies that the excess is optically thick at [ 24 ] .",
    "we conclude that this source is also a transition disk .",
    "the remaining three systems lacking h@xmath1 emission have disk temperatures of 300400 k and fractional infrared luminosities of 10@xmath5 .",
    "these characteristics make them candidates for dusty debris disk systems .",
    "we show that @xmath6 - 8 , 8 - 24 color - color diagrams are a useful tool to distinguish cool ( t@xmath82 @xmath7 300  k ) dusty mid - ir excess objects from hot ( t@xmath82 @xmath8 500  k ) dusty or free - free mid - ir excesses .",
    "such diagrams reveal that additional information beyond near / mid - ir colors is necessary to distinguish hot dust from free - free excesses .",
