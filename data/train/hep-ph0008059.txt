    "the study of the oscillations in the system of neutral @xmath2 mesons provides important information on the pattern of the cp violation in the standard model and its extentions ( a detailed discussion can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the main uncertainty in the theoretical description of the process arises from the nonperturbative long - distance contributions to the mixing amplitude . in the @xmath0 mixing there are two kinds of such contributions : first , effects related to the presence of the @xmath2-mesons in the initial and final states , and , second , corrections to the weak 4-quark amplitude due to the soft gluon exchanges between quarks of the initial @xmath2 and the final @xmath6 meson . by neglecting the second contribution the amplitude factorizes . in this case",
    "all nonperturbative effects connected with the meson formation are reduced to only one quantity - the leptonic decay constant @xmath7 .",
    "soft - gluon corrections to the weak 4-quark amplitude give rise to non - factorizable contributions , such that the influence of the @xmath2-meson structure is no longer described by the decay constant only .",
    "the understanding of the actual size of the non - factorizable effects and their adequate description in the heavy quark systems is an important and challenging task .",
    "the theoretical analysis of @xmath0 mixing was first performed within the qcd sum rules @xcite and later using lattice qcd , see @xcite and refs therein .",
    "the results from the sum rules are in all cases well compatible with factorization ( vacuum saturation ) , within rather large errors .",
    "recent lattice analyses definitely reported negative non - factorizable effects , around 5 - 10% for the central values at the scale @xmath8 .",
    "still , the errors of the calculations have a similar size .",
    "results from these approaches are shown in table [ table : results ] .",
    ".[table : results ] comparison of results from various approaches [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     our results are in good agreement with the lattice results , except for a slightly different estimate of the su(3 ) violating effects in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 cases .",
    "this nice agreement gives support to our ansatz for the description of the nonperturbative effects in the propagator of the color - octet @xmath11 system .",
    "we would like to notice that taking the ansatz ( [ prop ] ) and ( [ m0 ] ) for the propagator of the @xmath12 system and setting @xmath13 , with @xmath14 allows a parameter - free estimate of the @xmath15 mixing . in this case",
    "the result is much more stable with respect to the particular value of @xmath16 and therefore to the details of the propagator in the nonperturbative region .",
    "we obtained this way @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we considered corrections to factorization in the @xmath18 mixing amplitude due to soft - gluon exchanges , assuming that the main effect of such exchanges can be described in terms of the local gluon condensate .",
    "it was demonstrated that within this approximation correction of the order @xmath19 to the factorization is _",
    "negative_. it can be expressed through the specific @xmath2-meson transition form factors at zero momentum transfer .",
    "a relativistic dispersion approach based on the constituent quark picture has been used to calculate these form factors .",
    "spectral representations for the form factors in terms of the @xmath2-meson soft wave function and the propagator of the color - octet @xmath20 system were obtained .",
    "the behaviour of this propagator in the nonperturbative region was discussed .",
    "the obtained numerical estimates for @xmath21 favourably compare with the recent lattice calculations .",
    "let us point out that the proposed approach can be extended to the description of more complicated problems .",
    "in particular , it can be applied to the analysis of the non - factorizable effects in non - leptonic @xmath2 decays .",
