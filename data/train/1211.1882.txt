    "the 2011 nobel prize in physics has been awarded to perlmutter , riess and schmidt for their very careful and independent observations of distant supernovae , apparently showing the rate of expansion of the universe is accelerating . in 1998 , the promulgated observations of type ia supernova ( sneia ) established that our universe is presently accelerating ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; riess et al . 1998 ) and recent observations of sneia of high sureness level ( tonry et al .",
    "2003 ; riess et al . 2004 ; clocchiatti et al .",
    "2006 ) have further confirmed this .",
    "in addition , measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( bennett et al . 2003 ) and large scale structure ( lss ) ( tegmark et al .",
    "2004a ) strongly indicate that our universe is dominated by a component with negative pressure , dubbed as dark energy .",
    "these also indicate that the universe has a flat geometry on large scales .",
    "because there is not enough matter in the universe @xmath8 ether ordinary or dark matter @xmath8 to produce this flatness , the difference must be attributed to a `` dark energy '' .",
    "this same dark energy causes the acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "in addition , the effect of dark energy seems to vary , with the expansion of the universe slowing down and speeding up over different time . the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite experiment suggests @xmath9 content of the universe in the form of dark energy , @xmath10 in the form of non - baryonic dark matter and the rest @xmath11 in the form of the usual baryonic matter as well as radiation .",
    "+ high - precision measurements of expansion of the universe are required to understand how the expansion rate changes over time . in general relativity",
    ", the evolution of the expansion rate is parameterized by the cosmological equation of state ( the relationship between temperature , pressure , and combined matter , energy , and vacuum energy density for any region of space ) .",
    "measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today .",
    "the de model has been characterized in a conventional manner by the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath12 which is not necessarily constant , where @xmath13 is the energy density and @xmath14 is the fluid pressure ( carroll and hoffman 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath15 lies close to @xmath16 : it would be equal to @xmath16 ( standard @xmath17cdm cosmology ) , a little bit upper than @xmath16 ( the quintessence dark energy ) or less than @xmath16 ( phantom dark energy ) .",
    "while the possibility @xmath18 is ruled out by current cosmological data from sn ia ( supernovae legacy survey , gold sample of hubble space telescope ) ( riess et al . 2004 ; astier et al . 2006 ) , cmb ( wmap , boomerange ) ( eisentein et al . 2005 ; mactavish et al . 2006 ) and large scale structure ( sloan digital sky survey ) data ( komatsu et al . 2009 ) , the dynamically evolving de crossing the phantom divide line ( pdl ) ( @xmath19 ) is mildly favoured .",
    "the simplest candidate for the dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath17 , which has pressure @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , a reliable model should explain why the present amount of the dark energy is so small compared with the fundamental scale ( fine - tuning problem ) and why it is comparable with the critical density today ( coincidence problem ) ( copeland et al .",
    "that is why , the different forms of dynamically changing de with an effective equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath21 , have been proposed in the literature .",
    "some other limits obtained from observational results coming from sne ia data ( knop et al .",
    "2003 ) and combination of sne ia data with cmbr anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics ( tegmark et al . 2004 ) are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . the latest results in 2009 , obtained after a combination of cosmological datasets coming from cmb anisotropies , luminosity distances of high redshift type ia supernovae and galaxy clustering , constrain the dark energy eos to @xmath24 at @xmath25 confidence level ( komatsu et al .",
