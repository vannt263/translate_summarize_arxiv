    "the neglect of the other transition types for @xmath86 is justified as follows : if we randomly pick a state with @xmath27 excitations the number of _ loop transitions _ is simply given by the number of direct connections of a chosen mirco - state to states with one more or less up - spins .",

    "the probability that two states are linked by a reflection can be assessed by dividing the number of configuration pairs that exactly differ by the position of one up - spin ( which is on the order of @xmath58 ) by the total number of configurations @xmath88 with @xmath27-excitations ( that for @xmath86 grows exponentially with system size ) .",

    "the calculation is most easily done by using a spin - coherent state @xmath94 introduced in ref .",

    "<S> thermalization has been shown to occur in a number of closed quantum many - body systems , but the description of the actual thermalization dynamics is prohibitively complex . here , </S>",
    "<S> we present a model - in one and two dimensions - for which we can analytically show that the evolution into thermal equilibrium is governed by a fokker - planck equation derived from the underlying quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our approach does not rely on a formal distinction of weakly coupled bath and system degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that transitions within narrow energy shells lead to a dynamics which is dominated by entropy and establishes detailed balance conditions that determine both the eventual equilibrium state and the non - equilibrium relaxation to it .    how a closed quantum system reaches a steady state in which observables assume time - independent expectation values </S>",
    "<S> is both an intriguing and fundamental question in physics . </S>",
    "<S> when such a steady state can be described by an equilibrium thermodynamic ensemble we speak of `` thermalization '' . </S>",
    "<S> the study of closed quantum systems and their relaxation behavior has recently received renewed interest @xcite fuelled by ground breaking progress in preparing and manipulating ultracold atomic quantum gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> current experiments provide excellent thermal insulation from the environment and grant coherence times much longer than typical relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> these approximately closed systems therefore constitute an ideal test bed for the investigation of relaxation phenomena and thermalization @xcite . in spite of this experimental progress it is fair to say that there is still a lack of understanding as to when and under what circumstances quantum systems prepared far from thermal equilibrium relax to a steady state and when the acquired equilibrium state is compatible with predictions from statistical mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> a currently very successful and insightful approach relates thermalization to spectral properties of the many - body hamiltonian @xcite . in thermalizing systems </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of an observable @xmath0 calculated in an eigenstate with energy @xmath1 coincides with the thermal average taken in the microcanonical ensemble with the same energy , i.e. @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) @xcite which states that any individual many - body eigenstate contains a thermal state is numerically verified for a number of systems @xcite . in practice </S>",
    "<S> any initial state @xmath3 is a superposition of energy eigenstates @xmath4 . when these states are chosen to lie around a given energy @xmath1 shell relaxation to the microcanonical state </S>",
    "<S> will occur for long times as coherences between states of different energy wash out due to oscillating phase factors with incommensurate frequencies @xcite . while the eth is very useful to assess whether a system thermalises or not , the calculation of the actual thermalization dynamics requires the solution of the many - body schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of this task grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom and even the most powerful numerical methods are restricted to small systems , low dimensions and/or short propagation times @xcite .    from classical statistical mechanics </S>",
    "<S> we know that relaxation is often described by an effective evolution equation , such as a master or fokker - planck equation . </S>",
    "<S> it has the eventual equilibrium distribution as its stationary state due to the condition of detailed balance of its transition rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is an intriguing question whether such fokker - planck equation can be actually also be found for a thermalising and closed many - body quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> if the answer is affirmative it will mean that expectation values of @xmath0 can be calculated not only in the limit of infinite time , but also for intermediate times , and far from equilibrium , from a statistical ensemble .        </S>",
    "<S> finding a general answer to this question is a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to show that this idea can work in principle we present a non - integrable spin model in which an effective fokker - planck equation can be analytically derived - a simple ising - like spin-1/2 model on a lattice in a transverse magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> its hamiltonian reads @xmath5 with the pauli spin matrix @xmath6 and projector @xmath7 on the up - state on lattice site @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the spins to the field is parameterized by @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the conventional ising model the spin - spin interaction of strength @xmath10 is state - dependent , i.e.  two neighboring spins only interact when both of them are in the up - state . </S>",
    "<S> we study this model because it exhibits generic features , such as non - integrability , even in one dimension , and local interactions leading to complex dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is amenable to analytical treatment , and can be realised in experiment with ultracold lattice gases of laser - driven rydberg atoms @xcite , polar molecules @xcite , or with trapped ions @xcite .    in the strongly interacting regime , @xmath11 this system has been shown to thermalize @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thermalization was demonstrated to become explicit in the distribution function @xmath12 of the number of excitations ( up - spins ) which was shown to reach an equilibrium value for long times , i.e. @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 provides a meaningful measure of the degree of thermalization as it does not only capture local properties , e.g. the number of excitations @xmath14 but also encodes spatial correlations through @xmath15 and higher moments .    to illuminate the thermalization process we consider the limit @xmath16 . here </S>",
    "<S> the space of states with finite energy is spanned by all spin configurations in which neighboring excitations are absent . </S>",

    "<S> for example the state @xmath19 with @xmath20 excitations is directly coupled to the configuration @xmath21 with @xmath22 up - spins but _ not _ with @xmath23 since both are not linked by just a single spin - flip operation . </S>",

    "<S> that is , the initial conditions have to correspond to highly connected nodes of the graph , so that subsequent dynamics lead to a rapid spreading within the network of states . if the initial state is near the edge of the graph , for example a state with no excitations , its low connectivity implies that the mixing is less rapid and coherent oscillations persist for longer times @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> clearly , both are connected as they stem from one and the same closed system hamiltonian . </S>",
