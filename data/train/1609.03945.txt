    "in mller - plesset ( mp ) perturbation theory  @xcite , the hartree - fock ( hf ) one - determinant wave function is perturbatively corrected for the effect of single ( s ) , double ( d ) , etc . , excitations out of the state ( up to the level of @xmath2 excitations , where @xmath2 is the number of electrons in the system at hand ) .",
    "the target energy for the mp series is thus that of the full configuration interaction ( fci ) model .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian is in mp theory partitioned into the fock operator , @xmath3 ( a zeroth - order part ) , and the fluctuation potential , @xmath4 ( the perturbation ) , and at lowest ( second ) order , the resulting mp2 model marks a successful approach to the correlation problem in quantum chemistry , providing a useful , size - extensive doubles correction to the hf energy at a low computational cost .",
    "the higher - order corrections of the mp series , however , represent less successful treatments of the electron correlation problem , in part due to the fact that these models offer significantly worse compromises between cost and accuracy than does the mp2 model , and in part because of convergence problems that reflect inherent problems with the actual partitioning of the hamiltonian .",
    "we will now briefly revisit the reason why the mp series might occasionally diverge .    made possible by an efficient fci implementation  @xcite , a study appearing some twenty years ago numerically showed how , upon augmenting standard correlation - consistent basis sets of double-@xmath5 quality by diffuse functions  @xcite , the mp series was at the risk of becoming oscillating and , ultimately , divergent for a few prototypical , single - reference dominated examples  @xcite .",
    "these results were in stark contrast to the behavior of the series within non - augmented standard basis sets , for which the convergence behavior of the mp series had previously been found to reflect the dominance of the reference state in the exact solution  @xcite ( at least for mp expansions formulated upon restricted hf ( rhf ) references  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , since the convergence behavior of the mp series was found to exhibit an extreme dependence on the choice of one - electron basis set , even for simple examples dominated by a single determinant , for which no _ a priori _ reason for expecting divergences seemed to exist , the usefulness of the higher - order models of the mp series was immediately brought into question , for total energies as well as properties derived from these  @xcite .",
    "the numerical findings mentioned above were subsequently complemented by an explicit determination of the _ radius of convergence _ for the mp series  @xcite . in that study ,",
    "the electronic schrdinger equation was solved for an electronic hamiltonian expressed as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a complex perturbational strength parameter , such that the zeroth - order ( hf ) and physical ( fci ) wave functions were recovered by the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . when regarded in this way",
    ", the mp series is recognized as a power series expansion in @xmath7 of the fci eigenvalues .",
    "this expansion will then be divergent if the ground state becomes degenerate with some excited state at a _ point of degeneracy _ , @xmath10 , within the complex unit circle defined by @xmath11  @xcite . in practice , the authors of ref .",
    "replaced the above search for branch points of the ground state energy function by a search for avoided crossings between the ground state and excited states on the real axis only ( i.e. , they searched for real - valued points of avoided crossings within the interval @xmath12 $ ] ) , since such a search is far less complex than a search within the entire unit circle while still enabling the identification of degeneracies . in this terminology",
    ", an excited state is denoted a _",
    "back - door _ intruder if an avoided crossing is observed in the interval from @xmath13 , while it is denoted a _ front - door _ intruder if the crossing falls within the interval from @xmath14 .",
    "a few years later , the analysis in ref . was supplemented by a simple two - state model capable of explaining the divergence of the mp series  @xcite . in that study , it was illustrated how divergences are bound to occur whenever a basis set is sufficiently flexible to give a reasonable description of highly excited and diffuse back - door intruders , which couple only weakly to the ground state ( and , as such , are nearly invisible in the energy spectrum at either @xmath8 @xmath15 @xmath16 ) , leading the authors to state that _ divergence is the rule rather than exception in mp theory , which converges only in small basis sets_. this point has since then been repeatedly stressed and extended in related studies  @xcite .",

    "we have recently presented a range of perturbation series  @xcite that are all based on a coupled cluster  @xcite ( cc ) wave function rather than an hf wave function as the zeroth order state , while maintaining the mp partitioning of the hamiltonian . in the present study , we will extend the type of investigation outlined for the mp series above to these perturbative cc series as well as truncated mp series .",
    "our investigation is centered around the bivariational cc perturbation series introduced in ref .  , while a few results for the recently introduced energy - based cc perturbation series  @xcite will also be presented for comparison . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will introduce a general notation , cc[@xmath20 , for the cc model resulting from a truncation of the cluster operator at a specific level , @xmath21 ( i.e. , cc[@xmath22 is the cc singles and doubles  @xcite ( ccsd ) model , cc[@xmath23 is the cc singles , doubles , and triples  @xcite ( ccsdt ) model , etc . ) .",
    "in particular , we want to compare the convergence radii of * ( i ) * a family of so - called hf([@xmath19@xmath17 ) expansions , in which the correlation energy of a target cc[@xmath19 model is expanded in the fluctuation potential , with * ( ii ) * the bivariational cc[@xmath18([@xmath19@xmath17 ) expansions  @xcite , which describe the energetic difference between a parent model cc[@xmath18 and a target model cc[@xmath19 , again in orders of the fluctuation potential , cf .",

    "thus , the hf([@xmath19@xmath17 ) series are mp - like expansions , which theoretically converge from the hf energy , not towards the exact fci energy , but rather towards the energy of a cc target model , e.g. , the target energy of the hf(sdtq@xmath17 ) series is the ccsdtq  @xcite ( cc singles , doubles , triples , and quadruples ) energy .",
    "these series are thus equivalent to the standard mp series whenever the latter is restricted to at most @xmath24 $ ] excitations . as examples of the second type , the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) , ccsd(tq@xmath17 ) , and ccsdt(q@xmath17 ) series have all recently been proposed  @xcite , forming order expansions that converge from either the ccsd or ccsdt energies onto the ccsdt or ccsdtq energies , subject to the same partitioning of the electronic hamiltonian as that used in mp theory , i.e. , @xmath25 .    for both families of expansions ( based on either an hf or a cc reference state ) ,",
    "we will here probe for possible back- and front - door intruders in the real - valued interval @xmath12 $ ] by searching for those @xmath7-values , at which the ground state becomes degenerate with an excited intruder state .",
    "we consider four examples , all of which have previously been shown to have slowly convergent or divergent mp series  the ne atom , the f@xmath1 anion , and the singlet ch@xmath0 and hf molecules at equilibrium and distorted geometries , respectively  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , numerical results for the cc - based perturbation series for different choices of parent and target models will be reported in order to assess to what degree potential divergences might influence these . in this respect ,",
    "we wish to distinguish between two types of convergence , namely * ( i ) * formal convergence , i.e. , _ does a given expansion indeed converge ? _ , and * ( ii ) * practical convergence , i.e. , _ are the lowest - order corrections of a given series physically meaningful ? _ thus , while the formal convergence may be assessed by explicitly determining the radius of convergence , the practical convergence may be assessed simply by inspecting the lowest - order energy corrections . for this purpose",
    ", we have implemented arbitrary - order energy corrections for all members of the cc[@xmath18([@xmath19@xmath17 ) family of cc perturbation series .",
    "we will now outline the theory behind the intruder state scan and the computation of cc[@xmath18([@xmath19@xmath17 ) energy corrections to arbitrary order . in [ theory_formal_subsection ]",
    ", we discuss how the radii of convergence for the perturbation expansions are defined by the largest perturbation parameter for which the cc jacobian remains non - singular . in [ theory_scan_section ] , we use this insight to scrutinize the theoretical origin of possible intruder states from a comparison of the jacobians for hf- and cc - based perturbation series . finally , in [ theory_order_corrections_section",
    "] , we review our implementation of general - order cc[@xmath18([@xmath19@xmath17 ) energy corrections .",
    "the original analysis of the convergence of mp perturbation theory discussed in [ intro_section ] may not directly be applied to the present cc context , as the energies and wave function parameters are now obtained from a non - linear set of equations , rather than as the solutions to a standard hermitian eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian operator @xmath26 in cc theory , the energy is in general an analytic algebraic function of the cluster parameters , @xmath27 , and the perturbation strength , @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath28 . in searching for intruder states ,",
    "the task boils down to determining the range of @xmath7 within which the energy may be expressed in terms of an analytic function of @xmath7 , or , equivalently , as a convergent taylor series in @xmath7 . in turn , this range of @xmath7 is identical to the one where the cluster amplitudes may be formulated as analytic functions of @xmath7 . in order to actually determine this range , we write the non - linear set of equations that define the cluster amplitudes on the generic form @xmath29 with one equation for each individual cluster amplitude . assuming that for @xmath30 , the amplitudes @xmath31 satisfy the equations @xmath32 , the implicit function theorem  @xcite will ensure that the amplitudes are indeed analytic functions of @xmath7 in a neighborhood of @xmath33 , provided that the cc jacobian , i.e. , the derivative of [ eq_cceqs ] with respect to @xmath27 , is non - singular in the point @xmath34 . by examining the jacobian as a function of @xmath7 , we may determine a value @xmath35 as that value of @xmath7 that has the smallest norm while still giving rise to a singular jacobian .",
    "for @xmath36 , the cluster amplitudes  and hence the energy  is thus analytic , implying that @xmath37 may be expanded as a convergent taylor expansion around @xmath38 .    in standard cc response theory ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the jacobian are identified as excitation energies , which implicates that a singularity in the jacobian corresponds to a degeneracy between the ground state and an excited state .",
    "thus , although the convergence criteria for the standard mp series and the present cc perturbation series are obtained in different manners , the radius of convergence is in both cases identified as the lowest value of @xmath39 at which such a degeneracy occurs . phrased differently , the determination of the radius of convergence requires the determination of a complex variable @xmath7 that produces a zero - eigenvalue of the jacobian . as discussed in ref . , the imaginary part of this _ branch point _ is in general small for back - door intruders , whereas it may be large for front - door intruders . in both cases ,",
    "its approximate location may be determined from a scan over the eigenvalues of the jacobian for real values of @xmath7 , and on par with the procedure in refs . and , we will therefore only examine the lowest eigenvalue of the jacobian as a function of real values of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , instead of exact degeneracies , we will probe for avoided crossings where the real value of the lowest jacobian eigenvalue reaches a minimum . for a back - door intruder",
    ", the smallness of the imaginary part of the branch point will often lead to very pronounced avoided crossings with the lowest eigenvalue approaching zero , whereas for front - door intruders , the large imaginary part of the branch point tends to produce less pronounced avoided crossings .",
    "in general , the cc jacobian is a non - symmetric matrix .",
    "this fact leads to two main differences compared to the standard approach of fci , for which eigenvalues of an hermitian matrix are determined ( assuming that @xmath40 ) .",
    "first , a non - symmetric matrix needs not have a complete set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "thus , whereas the singularity of the jacobian matrix at the branch point trivially corresponds to a zero eigenvalue , it will not be ensured that this eigenvalue changes into another very small eigenvalue for a value of @xmath7 infinitesimally close to the branch point .",
    "however , we note that such abrupt dissolutions of zero eigenvalues were never encountered in the course of the present study .",
    "second , the eigenvalues of a non - symmetric matrix may be complex . thus , whereas for the hermitian case , the occurrence of an intruder state lower in energy than the reference state is a clear sign of a singularity ( and hence a branch point ) , this may not need be the case for a non - hermitian problem . however",
    ", since complex eigenvalues of a real matrix always occur in pairs with identical real parts and opposite imaginary parts , and due to the analyticity of the eigenvalues of a general non - degenerate matrix as functions of its elements , a real eigenvalue may only turn into a complex eigenvalue at a branch point .",
    "the immediate consequence of this is the practical convenience of being able to determine branch points in much the same way for cc perturbation theory as was previously realized for mp theory in refs . and .",
    "in formulating either of the hf- or cc - based series discussed in [ intro_section ] as order expansions in a perturbational strength parameter , @xmath7 , we partition the electronic hamiltonian according to [ hamiltonian_scaled ] .",
    "next , we define the amplitude equations ( [ eq_cceqs ] ) needed for the evaluation of the energy corrections in the series ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 amplitudes , respectively , for the hf- and cc - based series )    [ ampl_eqs_collected ] @xmath43    in [ ampl_eqs_collected ] , the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 cluster operators are all generically defined as @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 and @xmath49 being the amplitude and excitation operator , respectively , for excitation @xmath50 within the manifold at level @xmath51 ) , and the @xmath52 amplitudes are those of parent model cc[@xmath18 ( for an hf parent state , these trivially vanish ) .",
    "furthermore , the p- and q - spaces define the so - called primary and secondary ( complementary ) excitation manifolds , such that the @xmath42 and @xmath52 amplitudes have components within the primary space , while the @xmath41 and @xmath42 amplitudes both exist in the complementary space . for example , for the mp - like hf(sdt@xmath17 ) series , the p - space will be empty ( as is the case for all hf([@xmath19@xmath17 ) series ) and the q - space will be the complete manifold of all single , double , and triple excitations , while for the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) series , the p - space will contain all single and double excitations whereas the q - space will be restricted to the triples manifold only .",
    "a schematic illustration of some of these models is given in [ parent_target_state_overview_figure ] .",
    "since we will search for intruder states by probing for avoided crossings between the ground state and an excited state in the interval @xmath12 $ ] , the degeneracies will show up as zero - valued excitation energies . as mentioned in [ theory_formal_subsection ] , excitation energies are defined within cc response theory as eigenvalues of the cc jacobian , which may be derived as the derivative of the amplitude equations in [ ampl_eqs_collected ] with respect to either of the @xmath41 or @xmath42 sets of amplitudes",
    ". the elements of the jacobians for the hf([@xmath19@xmath17 ) and cc[@xmath18([@xmath19@xmath17 ) series are thus given as    [ jacobians_collected ] @xmath53 & = \\langle \\mu_i | \\exp{(-t(z))}[\\hat{h}(z),\\hat{\\tau}_{\\nu_j}]\\exp{(t(z ) ) } | \\text{hf } \\rangle \\label{hf_cc_jacobian } \\\\",

    "as is clear , the convergent behaviour of the series in the former of the two basis sets is deteriorated in the latter , as a new intruder dominated by quadruple excitations now enters the unit circle .",

    "in fact , the quadruples contribution to the description of the intruder state is so pronounced that if these are left out of the cluster operators in the cc - based series , the position of the avoided crossing is observed to shift from just within the unit circle , as for the ccsd(tq@xmath17 ) series in [ convergence_table ] and the ccsdt(q@xmath17 ) series in [ hf_ccpvdz_figure ] , to a value slightly below @xmath99 for the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) series , also shown in [ hf_ccpvdz_figure ] . thus , whereas both hf- and cc - based expansions are in general divergent for distorted hydrogen fluoride , it is possible to form truncated expansions that do converge by choosing a target state that does not include quadruple ( and higher - level ) excitations .",
    "this conclusion is thus equivalent to the one for the neon atom in [ neon_divergence_subsubsection ] , for which the omission of hextuple and higher - level excitations in the cluster operator leads to a convergent series . for both of the cc - based series in [ hf_ccpvdz_figure ] , however , a _",

    "although f@xmath1 is isoelectronic with ne , and the weight of the hf determinant is approximately the same for the two species in the cc - pvdz and aug - cc - pvdz basis sets ( @xmath102 ) , being an anion , the need for augmented basis sets in the accurate description of f@xmath1 is of utmost importance .",

    "furthermore , for an hf(sd@xmath17 ) order expansion of the ccsd correlation energy , no back - door intruder is observed .",
    "collectively , this indicates how the inclusion of triple excitations is the primary cause for the divergence of the hf(sdt@xmath17 ) series , see [ f_anion_1_figure ] .",
    "however , in contrast to this result , we note from [ f_anion_1_figure ] how the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) triples series converges .",
    "this difference between the hf(sdt@xmath17 ) and ccsd(t@xmath17 ) series hence indicates that the choice of parent state may also impact the convergence behavior of cc perturbation series , despite being a minor overall factor compared to the influence of basis set diffuseness and level of target state . relating this back to the analysis in [ theory_scan_section ]",
    ", this implies that if pronounced differences exist between the amplitudes of @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( i.e. , the difference in [ jacobian_difference ] is substantial ) , this may too impact the radius of convergence . the actual convergence of the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) series for f@xmath1 , though",
    ", is observed to be highly irregular and almost pulse - like , as may be realized from the detailed view of the order corrections in [ f_anion_2_figure ] .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", it should also be noted that the lowest jacobian eigenvalue obtained during the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) @xmath7-scan for f@xmath1 contained a very small imaginary component for @xmath7-values in the interval @xmath109 $ ] . however , based on the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) energy corrections in [ f_anion_1_figure ] and [ f_anion_2_figure ] alongside the fact that this imaginary component was found to be a full six orders of magnitude smaller than the ( positive ) real component , we conclude that the ccsd(t@xmath17 ) series for f@xmath1 is indeed convergent .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the @xmath7-scan of the jacobian for the ccsd(tq@xmath17 ) series was the only case in which the eigenvalue with the smallest real part had a large imaginary component . in this case , it is therefore not possible to use the @xmath7-scan on the real axis to determine whether the series is convergent or divergent .",
    "however , the perturbation expansion ( not shown ) was observed to diverge rapidly .    )",
    "series from the frozen - core / aug - cc - pvdz fci correlation energy for f@xmath1 . ]    of all the examples considered in the present work , we only encountered a single example ",
    "namely , the hf(sdt@xmath17 ) and ccsd(t@xmath17 ) series for f@xmath1for which the choice of parent state could be attributed as having an effect on the convergence behaviour , while the choice of target state is generally a much more important factor ( see [ neon_subsection ] and [ hf_dist_subsection ] ) .",
    "this contrast in significance is also illustrated by the fact that the ccsd(tq@xmath17 ) and ccsdt(q@xmath17 ) series for f@xmath1 both diverge , see [ convergence_table ] and [ f_anion_1_figure ] .",
    "it is , however , worth noting  by pragmatically comparing the corrections of the various series in [ f_anion_1_figure]how the use of the lowest - order corrections of any of the cc - based series is not invalidated in the case of f@xmath1 , as opposed to the situation for hf - based analogues , for which only the second - order ( mp2 ) correction is typically considered meaningful .",
    "now , the special case of the convergent ccsd(t@xmath17 ) series aside , the results in [ f_anion_1_figure ] highlight how the majority of the problems for f@xmath1 originates from the underlying mp partitioning of the electronic hamiltonian used in both the hf- and cc - based series , that is , the division of @xmath110 into the zeroth - order fock operator and a sizeable perturbation in the form of the fluctuation potential .",
    "this is so because the combination of an electron - rich ground state and an exceedingly diffuse excited state ( archetypal for anions in augmented basis sets ) makes for dominant contributions to either of the @xmath59 and @xmath85 jacobians that induce avoided crossings between such states for negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "this notion is further substantiated by probing for negative excitation energies using the @xmath63 jacobian in [ jacobian_common ] , for which the same crossing as in the hf(sdt@xmath17 ) and ccsdt(q@xmath17 ) series is again observed .",
    "the radius of convergence of various hf- and cc - based mp perturbation expansions with different cc target states has been determined for a selection of prototypical closed - shell examples that are known from the literature to have slowly convergent or even divergent mp series .",
    "in particular , we have probed for the presence of potential intruder states in truncated mp series as well as in the recently proposed ccsd(t@xmath17 ) triples and ccsd(tq@xmath17)/ccsdt(q@xmath17 ) quadruples series , in turn by probing for zero- or negative - valued excitation energies as calculated from the cc jacobian for each of the series .",
    "the similarities between the intruder states encountered in hf- and cc - based perturbation theory have been interpreted in terms of structural similarities between the resulting jacobians for the different series . by focusing on the common and dominating contribution to these , we have been able to confirm and supplement the main conclusions of the original mp convergence study in ref . .",
    "we have detailed how perturbation theory formulated around an mp partitioning of the electronic hamiltonian , be that based on an hf or a cc ground state wave function , will be prone to back - door intruder states whenever a description of diffuse continuum states is possible , as , for instance , is the case when an augmented basis set is used or the target state contains highly excited determinants .",
    "thus , in general , a divergent hf- or cc - based series for a given combination of molecular structure and basis set can likely be made convergent by reducing the excitation level of the target state and/or reducing the diffuseness of the basis set . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of parent state has typically ( but not always ) no effect on the convergence behaviour .",
    "furthermore , we have reiterated the statement saying that back - door intruders are indeed prevalent for electron - rich systems with dense ground state wave functions . from a comparison of the jacobians of hf- and cc - based perturbation theory ,",
    "both of these conclusions have been traced back to the fundamental mp partitioning of the hamiltonian , namely the fact that the perturbation within this framework , i.e. , the fluctuation potential , is substantial in size , in contrast with the general premise of perturbation theory where the perturbation in itself is assumed small .",
    "thus , we argue that the observed divergences are artefacts of the mp partitioning and , as such , inherent to any perturbation expansion that makes use of this . perhaps somewhat counterintuitive ,",
    "we have also illustrated how the magnitude of the actual energy difference , which is expanded in orders of the perturbation in any given perturbation series , is completely irrelevant for the actual convergence behaviour of said series .",
    "however , divergences aside , the cc - based perturbation series have all been observed to behave significantly more stably than the mp series or any of its truncated variants .",
    "furthermore , we have found the bivariational ccsd(t@xmath17 ) and ccsdt(q@xmath17 ) series to be capable of remedying the disordered oscillations at lower orders in the perturbation  which is traditionally one of the premier characteristics of divergent perturbation expansions  even in cases where these series formally diverge at higher orders . as such , despite the fact that the present analysis has been limited to minimal systems ( atoms and diatomics ) , we find that even when potential divergences exist , as , for instance , in the case of the ccsdt(q@xmath17 ) series for stretched hydrogen fluoride and the fluoride anion , these are not found to invalidate the use of lower - order models such as , e.g. , the ccsdt(q3 ) and ccsdt(q4 ) models .",
    "this is indeed an important point to stress , as formal divergences remain the norm rather than the exception for perturbation expansions in orders of the mp fluctuation potential , irrespective of whether these are based on an uncorrelated hf state or a correlated cc state .",
