    "classification of phase transitions is a narrative in statistical physics and quantum field theory .",
    "a common starting point is the distinction between first order transitions and continuous - or critical - transitions .",
    "while in first order transitions the order parameter is discontinuous , or more generally the free energy is non - differentiable , in continuous transitions the order parameter changes continuously and the free energy is non - analytic but has a first derivative .",
    "continuous transitions are known to possess universal features and can thus be categorized into universality classes , as opposed to first order transitions which are non - universal .",
    "the universality of critical transitions is tightly related to the divergence of a correlation length .",
    "much progress has been made in classifying critical transitions based on methods such as renormalization group and conformal field theory which rely on such divergence .    however , there are known examples that deviate from the above scheme , for instance transitions for which on the one hand the free energy is non - differentiable but on the other hand they display a diverging correlation length @xcite .",
    "early examples of such mixed order transitions ( mot ) include ( a ) one dimensional discrete spin models with long - range interactions @xcite , and ( b ) models of depinning transitions such as models of dna denaturation @xcite and of wetting @xcite .",
    "more recently there has been renewed interest in mot taking place in studies of percolation models in the context of glass and jamming transitions @xcite , evolution of complex networks @xcite and active biopolymer gels @xcite . while all these examples exhibit mot , they display some qualitative and quantitative differences .",
    "for instance the divergence of the correlation length is algebraic in some of them , while it is a stretched exponential in others . it would be interesting to understand the origin of the similarities and differences between the various models by studying them within a common framework .    in @xcite a new model which establishes a link between the classes of models (",
    "a ) and ( b ) was introduced and analyzed , thus making a step towards a unified view .",
    "specifically , this study focuses on two specific representative models of classes ( a ) and ( b ) : the one dimensional ising model with interactions decaying with the distance @xmath0 between spins as @xmath1 ( dubbed idsi , for inverse distance squared ising model ) @xcite and the poland scheraga ( ps ) model for dna denaturation @xcite .",
    "the first class exhibits a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) vortex unbinding like transition @xcite , while the second class exhibits a condensation transition similar to the bose einstein condensation ( bec ) transition of free bosons .",
    "the model presented in @xcite , which we shall refer to as the truncated idsi ( tidsi ) model , thus provides an intriguing connection between kt and bec transitions in one dimension .",
    "another appealing property of the tidsi model is that it is exactly soluble .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of @xcite in several directions :    * the calculations done in @xcite are elaborated , and many features of the phase diagram which where only briefly mentioned in @xcite are derived explicitly . * the exact free energies of different ensembles",
    "are derived .",
    "these shed new light on the origin of criticality in the mixed - order transition appearing in the tidsi model . *",
    "we generalize the model to include spins other than ising spins , so that these models could be compared with models of class ( a ) other than the idsi @xcite .",
    "we also consider long - range interactions decaying as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start in section [ sec : mixed - order - transitions ] by reviewing mot in one dimension and describe in detail the idsi and ps models .",
    "then in section [ sec : the - model ] the tidsi model is presented , and the relation to the idsi and ps model is discussed .",
    "we also summarize in this section the main results of the paper , including the phase diagram and the free energies .",
    "the next three sections are dedicated to deriving these results using grand canonical analysis ( section [ sec : grand - canonical - analysis ] ) , canonical analysis ( section [ sec : canonical - analysis ] ) and renormalization group ( rg ) analysis ( section [ sec : rg - analysis ] ) .",
    "while the tidsi model is exactly soluble , the idsi model is not , but as we show in section [ sec : rg - analysis ] the rg analysis can be used as a common framework for studying both models .",
    "the tidsi model is then extended to include more general interactions ( section [ sub : general - interactions - decay ] ) and other spin variables ( section [ sub : general - spins ] ) .",
    "in this section we briefly review two models exhibiting mot in one dimension . as mentioned above these models are prototypical representatives of wider classes of models .",

    "more generally , one can consider interactions decaying as @xmath8 .",
    "it has been proved by ruelle @xcite and dyson @xcite that @xmath9 is a borderline case , i.e. that models with @xmath10 exhibit no phase transition , while models with @xmath11 show a symmetry breaking transition at some finite critical temperature @xmath12 .",
    "models with @xmath13 have non - extensive energy and hence they are ordered at all temperatures",
    ". we shall henceforth refer to the @xmath9 case as the inverse distance squared ising ( idsi ) model .",
    "thouless , through an entropy - energy argument , has suggested that the idsi model exhibits a unique phase transition in which the magnetization exhibits a discontinuity at the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "dyson proved the existence of such a transition , ( where the discontinuity of the order parameter is dubbed the `` thouless effect '' ) , in a hierarchical version of the model @xcite . a scaling analysis carried out by anderson et al .",
    "@xcite and a later renormalization group ( rg ) analysis done by cardy @xcite , showed that the transition in the idsi model is of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type @xcite , with correlation length which diverges at the transition with an essential singularity as @xmath14 .",
    "the rigorous proof for the existence of the transition in the idsi model was given only in the 1980 s by frohlich and spencer @xcite , while the mixed order nature of the transition was proved substantially later by aizenman et al .",
    "a numerical validation for the analytical predictions was given in @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the idsi model in the temperature - magnetic field @xmath15 plane is given in fig.[fig : idsi_pt]a . it resembles the @xmath16 dimensional ising model phase diagram , with a low - temperature first order transition at zero magnetic field @xmath17 , which terminates at a critical point at @xmath12 .",
    "the only qualitative difference is that at @xmath18 the transition of the idsi is discontinuous , that is the order parameter  the magnetization  jumps from @xmath19 at @xmath20 to @xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "however , the transition , as mentioned above , is still critical as there is a diverging correlation length .",
    "this is different from more common first order symmetry breaking transitions , as is found , for instance , in blume - capel model @xmath23 in a certain range of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 and at @xmath26 .",
    "a schematic temperature - magnetic field phase diagram for the blume - capel model for fixed @xmath24 and @xmath25 is presented in fig.[fig : idsi_pt]b . here",
    "the @xmath18 , @xmath26 point is actually a triple point in which three first order lines meet , i.e. in which three phases coexist .",
    "these are the @xmath27 phase , the @xmath28 phase and the disordered phase .",
    "there are also finite @xmath17 transition lines on which there is a coexistence of two magnetically ordered phases .",
    "these finite @xmath17 lines terminate in a usual second order critical point @xcite .",
    "although the main features of the phase diagram of the idsi model have been proven rigorously @xcite , there are many missing details : non - universal quantities such as the critical temperature are not known exactly .",
    "the free energy of the model was not calculated , and clearly the partition function can not be calculated in any ensemble .",
    "the model which is analyzed in this paper is a modified version of the idsi in which all of these quantities can be exactly calculated .      a typical configuration of the ps model ]",
    "the ps model is a model of dna denaturation @xcite .",
    "denaturation is the process in which the two strands of the double - stranded dna molecule separate upon heating .",
    "the ps model idealizes the dna molecule as an alternating chain of bound segments and denatured loops as depicted in fig.[fig : ps_config ] . for homopolymers , while a bound segment of length @xmath29 contributes an energy @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the binding energy of dna base - pairs , loops are assumed to contribute no energy , but they contribute entropy @xmath32 of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are some non - universal constants and @xmath36 is a universal exponent termed the _ loop exponent_. thus @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this form emerges from modeling the denatured loop as a closed path @xcite , which results in a universal exponent @xmath36 that depends only on dimensionality and topological constraints , i.e. whether the path is considered as an ideal walk , self avoiding walk etc . @xcite .",
    "the order parameter for this system is the fraction of bound base - pairs @xmath40 , with @xmath41 above the melting temperature @xmath42 , and is positive below @xmath42 .",
    "the nature of the transition depends on the exponent @xmath36 , as depicted in the phase diagram in fig.[fig : ps_pt ] : for @xmath43 the strands are bound at all temperatures and @xmath44 . for @xmath45",
    "there is a continuous transition at @xmath18 with @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath48 the order parameter is discontinuous , i.e. @xmath49 as @xmath47 .",
    "for all @xmath50 the correlation length @xmath51 diverges at the transition point as @xmath52 with @xmath53 , and hence for @xmath48 the transition is of mot type .",
    "the mechanism of the transition is mathematically similar to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) transition in non - interacting bose gas , with the condensate being the macroscopic loop formed at the transition temperature @xmath42 .",
    "phase diagram of the ps model . ]",
    "there are several clear differences between the mot transition in the ps model and in the idsi model .",
    "first , the correlation length in the two models diverges differently : algebraically in the ps model and as a stretched exponential in the idsi model . within a renormalization group analysis",
    ", the ps model displays a one - parameter family of fixed points with continuously varying exponent while the transition in the idsi is controlled by a single fixed point .",
    "in addition , the ps transition is a condensation transition which is characterized by the formation of a single macroscopic loop .",
    "no such macroscopic object is associated with the idsi transition .",
    "finally , while the idsi transition is a symmetry breaking transition , there is no symmetry which is broken in the ps case . to understand the origin of the similarities and differences between these two models  and between the classes they represent",
    " we introduced in @xcite the tidsi model which serves as a bridge between these models .",
    "we now turn to define the model and show explicitly its similarity to those two models .",
    "like the idsi model , the tidsi model of @xcite is defined on a one dimensional ising chain , where on each site @xmath54 there is a spin variable @xmath5 .",
    "the interaction between spins is composed of a nearest neighbor interaction term @xmath55 and a long - range interaction term @xmath56 , where @xmath57 if sites @xmath54 and @xmath58 are in the same domain of either all up or all down spins , and @xmath59 otherwise .",
    "thus the long - range interactions ( beyond nearest neighbors ) are confined within each of the domains . as in the idsi model",
    "we take the interaction strength @xmath60 to decay as @xmath1 .",
    "the indicator function @xmath61 can be written explicitly in terms of the spin variables @xmath62 hence the resulting hamiltonian reads @xmath63 which explicitly contains multi - spin interactions of arbitrary order .",
    "for concreteness we take @xmath64 for @xmath65 , even though the results are qualitatively the same for any @xmath60 which has the same asymptotic form .",
    "an alternative representation of a configuration of the model is in terms of domains : each microscopic configuration is defined in terms of the spin at the first site @xmath66 , the number of domains @xmath67 and their lengths @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 . due to the truncation of the long - range interactions to within domains ,",
    "the energy ( [ eq_model : ttt_hamiltonian1 ] ) can straightforwardly be expressed in terms of these variables : the nearest neighbors term sums up to @xmath71=2j_{nn}n - j_{nn}\\left(l+1\\right),\\label{eq_model : h_nn}\\ ] ] while the energy contribution of the long - range term for each domain @xmath72 is given by @xmath73\\nonumber \\\\   & = & -bl+c\\log\\left(l\\right)+\\tilde{\\delta}+o\\left(l^{-1}\\right),\\label{eq_model : h_lr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 is an expansion coefficient , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "eq.([eq_model : h_lr ] ) is of the same form as @xmath78 where @xmath32 is the loop entropy in the ps model given in eq.([eq_1d : ps_ent ] ) , under the mapping @xmath79 where @xmath80 ( we use units in which the boltzmann constant @xmath81 is unity ) . in essence , the physics of both models stem from the logarithmic dependence of the energy ( entropy ) on the domain ( loop ) length .",
    "the mapping between energy and entropy implies an inversion of the temperature role , and hence of a mapping between the high temperature phase of the ps model and the low temperature phase of the tidsi model .",
    "other than this trivial difference , the phenomenology of the two models is almost identical .",
    "the only qualitative difference between the phase diagrams of the two models is due to the additional spin inversion symmetry which exists in the tidsi model and is lacking in the ps model , as will be discussed below .",
    "another important difference is that while the parameter @xmath36 in the ps model is a universal exponent , for the tidsi model the corresponding parameter @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , depends on the details of the model such as the nearest - neighbors coupling @xmath84 .    neglecting terms of order @xmath85 and combining ( [ eq_model : h_nn ] ) and ( [ eq_model : h_lr ] )",
    ", the hamiltonian expressed by the domains variables reads @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the constant term in ( [ eq_model : ttt_hamiltonian2 ] ) , which contains also expressions like @xmath88 , can be set to @xmath19 without loss of generality , and this will be our convention henceforth . in terms of the mapping to the ps model , the hamiltonian ( [ eq_model : ttt_hamiltonian2 ] ) can be viewed as the log - boltzmann factor of a configuration made up of a sequence of loops without bound segments in between , as depicted in fig.[fig : ttt_ps_map ] .",
    "hence the tidsi model can be viewed either as a truncated version of the idsi model or as a symmetrized version of the ps model .",
    "an illustration of the tidsi model as a symmetric ps model , where all spin are within loops ( domains ) and none are in bound segments ( compare to fig.[fig : ps_config ] ) . ]",
    "the transition in the tidsi model can be described using two order parameters : first , the magnetization @xmath89 , which in the domains variables reads @xmath90 the second order parameter is the density of domains @xmath91 .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath17 can be added to the hamiltonian ( [ eq_model : ttt_hamiltonian2 ] ) by adding a term @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and similarly a loop chemical potential @xmath94 can be added as @xmath95 .    finally , we should define the statistical ensemble which we shall focus on .",
    "both the idsi and ps models are defined in the canonical ensemble in which the length of the chain @xmath4 is fixed . the partition function of the tidsi model in this ensemble can be written in terms of the domains variables as @xmath96 with @xmath97 given by ( [ eq_model : ttt_hamiltonian2 ] ) and the indicator function @xmath98 if @xmath99 is true and is @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "however , we also consider more restricted ensembles in which either the magnetization @xmath100 or number of domains @xmath101 or both are fixed .",
    "the free energies in such ensembles play a similar role of a landau free energy , enabling deeper understanding of the nature of the transition , as we discuss below .",
    "the partition function in the ensemble in which both @xmath100 and @xmath101 are fixed reads @xmath102 from this partition function we can derive the marginal partition sums @xmath103      in this section we present a summary of the results derived for the tidsi model in sections [ sec : grand - canonical - analysis ] and [ sec : canonical - analysis ] .",
    "as stated above , the transition in the tidsi model is quite similar to the transition of the ps model ( only the role of temperature is inverted ) : the high temperature phase of the tidsi model is composed of a gas of microscopic ( finite size ) domains , while the low temperature phase consists essentially of a single macroscopic domain .",
    "the transition is then a condensation transition , it is mot for zero magnetic field but can be either continuous or mot for nonzero field , as discussed in details in the next subsection .",
    "in addition to calculating exactly the phase diagram , we calculated the free energies of the model in ensembles in which either the magnetization or the density of domains are fixed .",
    "these free energies play the role of the landau free energies in some sense , and hence allow a deeper understanding of the behavior of the system , as discussed in subsection [ sub : free - energies ] .",
    "the phase diagram of the tidsi model is presented in fig.[fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "fig.[fig : phase_diagram]a displays the transition temperature ( @xmath42 ) as a function of the coupling @xmath36 at @xmath26 . here",

    "the phase is ordered , but unlike spin models with two - body interactions , the magnetization is saturated , i.e. @xmath110 throughout the low temperature phase .",
    "in addition @xmath111 as there is essentially a single macroscopic domain .",
    "this jump between zero to saturated magnetization is an extreme example of the thouless effect . as mentioned above , the thouless effect  first conjectured to take place in the idsi model",

    "we discuss the similarities and differences in the phenomenology of the three models .",
    "the tidsi model has a very similar phase diagram to that of the ps model , as can be appreciated by comparing fig.[fig : ps_pt ] and fig.[fig : phase_diagram]a , recalling the inverted role of the temperature in the two models .",
    "essentially the mechanism of the phase transition is the same , i.e. a condensation transition in which a single domain - or a single loop - becomes macroscopic and encompasses the whole system .",
    "there are a few differences , though , which we shall discuss now .",
    "the most important difference is that at @xmath26 , the tidsi model exhibits an extreme transition in magnetization , from @xmath199 to @xmath166 .",
    "this also happens for @xmath45 , for which the ps model exhibits a second order transition .",
    "the reason for this difference is the symmetry between @xmath27 and @xmath28 spins in the tidsi model , which is lacking in the ps model . due to this symmetry ,",
    "the magnetization vanishes above the transition ( as long as there is no magnetic field ) . to break the symmetry there must be either an external symmetry breaking field or a spontaneous symmetry breaking transition .",
    "note that once a symmetry breaking field is applied , the transition becomes almost identical to the ps transition , as for @xmath130 the transition is second order .",
    "a second related difference is the existence of two order parameters which behave differently for @xmath45 : the density of domains , @xmath174 , which is continuous and the magnetization which is discontinuous .",
    "this has to do with the symmetry of the model under magnetization reversal , which has no counterpart for the @xmath174 order parameter .",
    "hence the behavior of @xmath174 in the tidsi model is the same as that in the ps model .",
    "another difference has to do with the parameter @xmath36 . in the ps model",
    "this parameter is the universal exponent controlling the number of configurations of a self - avoiding random loop .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is hence independent of geometry and depends only on the spatial dimension and topological constraints . in the tidsi model ,",
    "on the other hand , the parameter @xmath200 itself is rather arbitrary , and moreover the value of the critical temperature @xmath160 depends both on @xmath200 and on @xmath25 , or the nearest neighbors interactions .",
    "hence @xmath201 depends on the model parameters rather than being universal .",
    "the main similarity between the idsi model and the tidsi model is that both exhibit a mixed order symmetry breaking phase transition .",
    "there are , however , some distinctions between the two models .",
    "while the tidsi has a finite magnetic field transition , the idsi model exhibits no such transition , as expected from ising ferromagnet with two body interactions by the lee - yang theorem @xcite .",
    "another difference is the divergence of length - scale at the transition , which is algebraic for the tidsi model and essential singularity in the case of the idsi model .",
    "the origin of this behavior is discussed in section [ sec : rg - analysis ] through the renormalization group analysis .",
    "perhaps a more fundamental difference between the models is the fact that in the idsi there is no formation of a macroscopic domain ( where a domain is defined as a consecutive set of spins all having the same sign ) .",
    "while the density of domains was not analyzed in the case of idsi , it seems that it does not vanish for any finite temperature , though an interesting question is whether it is analytic at the transition or not .",
    "the lack of condensation in the idsi is obviously the reason that the thouless effect in this model is not extreme , i.e. that the magnetization jumps to a finite number @xmath202 .",
    "we now establish analytically the results stated above .",
