    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) is one of the most important foundations of modern physics .",
    "however , the philosophic and physical debates on this fundamental theory are still continuing ever since its first presence . among the various critiques on qm ,",
    "the most important and famous one is what proposed by einstein and his collaborators on whether the qm is a complete theory or not .",
    "einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) @xcite questioned the completeness of qm by using a so - called _ gedanken experiment _ which was then named the epr paradox . in section 2",
    "we introduce the epr paradox in details , the explanation for the paradox in local hidden variable theory ( lhvt ) , and the bell theorem , which exhibits the contradiction of lhvt with qm and presents the non - locality nature of qm as the foundation of the modern quantum information theory . in section 3",
    "we first introduce some optical experiments in testing the bell inequalities .",
    "then , we turn to the related studies in high energy physics in section 4 . the last section is remained for conclusions for the past researches in testing the bell inequalities , and expectations for future investigations , especially in high energy physics .",
    "in 1935 , einstein , podolsky , and rosen demonstrated in a work @xcite that quantum mechanics could not provide a complete description for the  physical reality \" of two spatially separated but quantum mechanically correlated particle system . in the paper they described the following criterion of `` physical reality '' : _",
    "if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.e. , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity .",
    "_ then they proposed the necessary condition for theories to be complete : _ every element of the physical reality must have a counterpart in the physical theory .",
    "_    people noticed that the idealized experiment ( _ gedanken experiment _ ) proposed by epr is not suitable for designing the practical experiment .",
    "it requires to configure an entangled state , which is of the eigenstate of relative position and total momentum .",
    "however , this is not practical .",
    "moreover , even if it could be constructed , such state can not be a stationary state .",
    "it will only be in transitory existence , which makes the epr argument fail .",
    "bohm @xcite proposed a more realistic experiment which can illustrate the epr paradox .",
    "he considered the two - particle spin - one - half system in spin singlet and zero angular momentum . in spin space",
    ", the wave function of this state can be expressed as @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote  spin up \" and  spin down \" in certain coordinate frame .",
    "assuming the two particle interaction does not involve spin - dependent term , particles are allowed to separate apart with the total spin of the system invariant , for example along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "when they are separated well beyond the range of interaction , we can measure the @xmath6-component of the spin of particle a. due to angular moment conservation at all time , we can predict that the @xmath6-component of spin b must have the opposite value . in the meantime , because the spin singlet has spacial rotation invariance , the same thing happens when we measure the @xmath7-component of spin of particle a. since the two particles are far apart with each other , the locality condition guarantees that the particle b does not know what happens to a while the measurement performs .",
    "therefore , it shows that the b particle spins along @xmath7 and @xmath6 axes should be both physical realities . in qm the spin operators along different axes",
    "do not commute and thus can not simultaneously have definite values , therefore they can not be simultaneously in physical realities . hence , einstein concluded that qm must be incomplete .",
    "bohr contested not the epr demonstration but their premises .",
    "his point of view is that an element of reality is associated with a concretely performed act of measurement .",
    "we can not perform the measurement along different axes simultaneously on particle a , so the spins of the particle b along different axes need not to be simultaneously physical realities .",
    "however , as einstein questioned that these arguments make the reality of particle b depend upon the process of the measurement performed on the first particle , and he believed that _  no reasonable definition of reality could be expected to do this . \" _      to avoid the epr paradox , it might be a reasonable choice to postulate some additional ` hidden variables ' , which presumably will restore the completeness , determinism and causality to the theory .",
    "this kind of theories are named the local hidden variable theories .",
    "nevertheless , once von neumann , based on some axioms @xcite , demonstrated that it is impossible to construct such a hidden variable theory @xcite reproducing all the results of qm .",
    "it was later on discovered that one of the von neumann s axioms in getting his conclusion is too much restrictive . and ,",
    "indeed some counter examples were constructed in the two dimensional space @xcite .",
    "that means the lhvt model can produce all the qm predictions but without fulfil von neumann s restrictive hypotheses .",
    "nevertheless , there remains certain difference in between qm and lhvt . in 1964 bell",
    "showed @xcite that in realistic lhvts the two particle correlation functions satisfy a set of bell inequalities ( bi ) , whereas the corresponding qm predictions may violate these inequalities in some region of parameter space . the definition of correlation for lhvts and qm , according to bohm , read respectively as : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the distribution of hidden variable regardless of whether @xmath10 is a single variable or a set , or even a set of functions .",
    "these variables can be either discrete or continuous .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate spin directions .",
    "the original inequality obtained by bell is @xmath13 where @xmath14 mean three different spin directions . in 1969 ,",
    "clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) @xcite generalized the inequality ( [ bell1 ] ) to a more practical one , i.e. @xmath15 a similar inequality to chsh was derived by bell in 1971 @xcite , read as @xmath16 the correlation function @xmath17 in above inequalities is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the total number of particle pairs , and @xmath21 means that two particle has the same ( opposite ) spin directions . to suffice for experimental test",
    ", the total number of particle pair emissions @xmath20 should be known .",
    "however , in real practice the probability can not be measured without either destroying or depolarizing the particle pairs . in 1974",
    "clauser and horne ( ch ) @xcite deduced an inequality , for which the upper limit is experimentally testable without knowing the @xmath20 .",
    "that is @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the probability of finding a pair of particles with no polarization detection on one side .",
    "it is easy to find that the ch inequality ( [ ch ] ) is consistent with inequality ( [ bell ] ) .",
    "provided that in an experiment with two detectors and double channel analyzers , one can get three similar sets of inequalities like eq.([ch ] ) with different indices @xmath24 .",
    "multiplying the inequalities with @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xmath27 and combining these four inequalities we can obtain the inequality ( [ bell ] ) .",
    "it is generally realized that unlike the von neumann s mathematical results these inequalities can be reached in experiment in testing the validity of qm in comparison with lhvts .",
    "bell theorem reveals peculiar properties of quantum  entangled \" states that were previously not appreciated .",
    "many a generalization of bell inequality aiming at getting optimal violations was developed .",
    "better inequalities ( inequalities with larger violation and/or wide range of parameter space for violation ) are of both experimental and theoretical interest . in further development , one may create new inequalities , or explore the non - local character of a particular quantum state .",
    "of course these two seemingly different investigation schemes are correlated .",
    "braunstein and caves @xcite made an extension of the inequality ( [ bell ] ) .",
    "they added two kinds of ( [ bell ] ) up with different directions and got : @xmath28 usually , combining two inequalities directly will lead to an inequality with looser constraint than before",
    ". however ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this kind of adding chain may lead to even stronger quantum violations . in this way",
    ", we may reexpress their result in a different form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that when @xmath31 ( [ limitation ] ) corresponds to the maximal violation of ( [ bell1 ] ) ; @xmath32 corresponds to the maximal violation of ( [ bell ] ) ; and @xmath33 corresponds to the maximal violation of ( [ bcaves ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 which are in contradiction with lhvts . in",
    "above and following equations , the alphabetic letter on the left side represents the projector of particle 1 , and the right one for particle 2 .",
    "eq.([jordan0 ] ) and eq.([jordan ] ) can be easily understood , i.e. , if @xmath36 then @xmath37 according to the second equality of eq.([jordan0 ] ) . and similarly if @xmath38 then @xmath39 according to the first equality of eq.([jordan ] ) . from the second inequality of eq.([jordan ] ) we can infer that it is possible for @xmath40 and @xmath17 to be 1 simultaneously , and so are the @xmath41 and @xmath42 . however",
    ", this is apparently in confliction with what the first equality of eq.([jordan0 ] ) tells .",
    "jordan also demonstrated in a converse way @xcite that for any choice of four different measurements , there exists a state satisfying hardy s argument .",
    "garuccio in 1995 found @xcite that the contradiction between qm and lhvt can be embedded in ch inequalities of ( [ ch ] ) , i.e. @xmath43 along hardy s logic , cabello @xcite formulated a ghz type of proof involving just two observers .",
    "ref.@xcite demonstrated that for the state that is a product of two singlet states , there exists a operator satisfying @xmath44 bell inequalities in optical experiment ---------------------------------------    many experiments in regard of the bell inequalities have been carried out by using the entangled photons . in the optical experiment",
    "the correlation of polarizers in orientations * a * and * b * is defined as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the coincidence rate of photon polarizations ; @xmath47 for parallel and @xmath48 for perpendicular to the chosen direction . of the various optical experiments ,",
    "one of the important ones was carried out by aspect _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which the photons are generated from the atomic cascade radiation @xmath49 . in the experiment they use the two - channel polarizers in orientations * a * and * b * , and a fourfold coincidence counting system by which the four coincidence rates @xmath50 can be measured in a single run , and they obtain directly the polarization correlation @xmath51 .",
    "their measurement gave @xmath52 this result is in excellent agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics , which , for their polarizer efficiencies and lens apertures , gives @xmath53 .",
    "this experiment has been performed with the static setups in which polarizers are fixed for the whole duration of a run .",
    "a more important improvement of this experiment was made by the same group of people @xcite , in which they added two optical switches that can be randomly chosen in between two directions .",
    "the result also violates the upper limit of bell s inequality and in a good agreement with qm calculation .",
    "some other relevant and important progresses in this direction were realized by using the parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) @xcite technique in generating the entangled photon pairs .",
    "an ideal experiment with two channel polarizers , which randomly reoriented during the propagation of photons , has been fulfilled in real world @xcite .",
    "the necessary space - like separation of the observation was achieved by keeping sufficiently large physical distance between the measurement stations ( alice and bob was spatially 400 m apart in the experiment ) , by ultra - fast and random setting of the analyzers , and by completely independent data registration .",
    "the experiment finally gave @xmath54 for 14700 coincident events collected in 10s .",
    "this correspond to violation of the chsh inequality of 30 standard deviations assuming only the statistical errors exist .",
    "recent measurements of the bell inequality violation are realized through the multi - photon entangled states @xcite .",
    "it is directly applied to test the multi - photon generalizations of the bell theorem @xcite .",
    "the experimental result complies with the quantum mechanics prediction while contradicts with the lhvts prediction by over 8 standard deviations @xcite .",
    "the non - maximally entangled hardy state was also realized in optical experiment @xcite .",
    "the measurement further confirmed the qm but denied local realistic results @xcite .",
    "a generalization @xcite of cabello s argument in ref.@xcite was put into experiment in @xcite , using two photon four dimension entanglement ( two polarization and two spatial degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the observable @xmath55 gave a violation of lhvts by about 294 standard deviations .",
    "in all , for now all of the known experimental results @xcite in photon experiment are substantially consistent with the prediction of the standard qm .",
    "it is well - known that the main difficulty in the photon experiment is of the detect efficiency .",
    "although the situation is improved in the pdc case , in practice the efficiency is still quite low .",
    "for example , the detection / collection efficiency is only abut 5% in @xcite . as aforementioned",
    "the total number of emission is very important to the setup of correlation . to make these experimental measurements logically comparable to bell inequalities one needs to make supplementary assumptions",
    "that is : the ensemble of actually detected pairs is independent of the orientations of the polarimeters , and the detected photon pairs is a fair sample of the the ensemble of all emitted pairs . in the multi - photon case",
    "the similar detection loophole appears as well @xcite .",
    "people notice that the former experiments in testing the completeness of qm are mainly limited in the electromagnetic interaction regime , i.e. , by employing the entangled photons , no matter whether the photons are generated from atomic cascade or pdc method .",
    "considering of the fundamental importance of the concerned question , to test the lhvt in experiment with massive quanta and with other kinds of interactions is necessary @xcite .",
    "to this aim , the spin singlet state , as first advocated by bohm and aharonov @xcite to clarify the epr argument , is exploited in experiment at the beginning .",
    "lamehi - rachti and mitting @xcite performed an experiment in the low energy proton - proton scattering at saclay tandem accelerator .",
    "their measurement of the spin correlation of protons gave a good agreement with what the qm tells .",
    "as early as 1960s the epr - like features of the @xmath56 pair in the decays of @xmath57 vector particles were noticed by some authors @xcite . in the early attempts of testing lhvts through the bell inequality in high energy physics , people focused on exploiting the nature of particle spin correlations @xcite . typically , in ref .",
    "@xcite trnqvist suggested to measure the bi through the following process : @xmath58 two different decay modes of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are considered by trquist . in",
    "ref.@xcite the matrix element for @xmath61 or @xmath62 decay generically takes the following form : @xmath63 here , @xmath64 represents the interaction which induces the hadronic transition of @xmath65 to final states .",
    "@xmath66 represents spin structure of the charmonium . after taking the standard procedure , one",
    "obtain the transition probability .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 decay it reads : @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the @xmath65 decay asymmetry parameter ; @xmath69 and @xmath70 are unit vectors along the @xmath71 and @xmath72 momenta in @xmath73 and @xmath65 rest frame , respectively .",
    "trnqvist argued that apart from the constant @xmath74 and the sign before @xmath75 , ( [ ratioeta ] ) is in equivalence with eq.([bohm ] ) obtained in measuring the spin correlation in the bohm s _ gedanken experiment_. here , the directions of the pion momentum @xmath69 and @xmath70 take the place of the spin - analyzing directions of the polarimeters .",
    "for @xmath62 decays , @xmath76\\ ; .\\label{jpsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dm2 collaboration @xcite observed @xmath77 events with about @xmath78 being identified as from process @xmath79 .",
    "the experimental measurement unfortunately does not give a very significant result@xcite due to the insufficient statistics .",
    "a similar process was suggested by privitera @xcite , i.e. , @xmath80 in analogy with what in charmonium decays , in this case the expected correlation rate is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are unit vectors in the momentum directions of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "hereby , the strong spin correlation between two @xmath84 s reveals the nonlocal nature of the epr argument .",
    "the subsequent @xmath84 decay works as a spin analyzer , and the correlation is transferred to the decay products .",
    "the above mentioned designs for experimentally measuring the violation of bi are delicate and attractive , however , people found that such proposals possess controversial assumptions @xcite .",
    "they all assume that the decay matrix elements contain the nonlocal correlations , i.e. , eq.([ratioeta ] , [ jpsi ] , [ tau ] ) . however , there is no dichotomic observable which can be directly measured in real experiment .",
    "the momentum of pion is a continuous variable , and different momenta are compatible , i.e. [ @xmath85 , @xmath86 = 0 @xcite .",
    "thus a lhvt can be constructed in respect of all the results from qm , and there will be no violation of bell inequality anyway .      in testing the lhvts in high energy physics , using the  quasi - spin \" to mimic the photon polarization in the construction of entangled states is a practical way .",
    "for example , for kaon the quantum number of strangeness @xmath87 , which takes either 1 or -1 , can play the role of spin .",
    "several groups suggested to study the @xmath56 system in the @xmath2 factory to test the lhvt ( for details , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "up to now , there are two different ways in the  quasi - spin \" scheme . in the first way ,",
    "one fixes up the quasi - spin , but leaves the freedom in time .",
    "for example , one measures the flavor taste in different decaying time on each side , then the time differences plays the role of polarization angles .",
    "the second one is to leave the freedom in quasi - spin but to fix the time . in this case",
    "we measure the different eigenstates of the particles at the same time on each side , then the different eigenstates play the role of polarization angles .",
    "a typical process produces entangled state in @xmath88 system is through @xmath89 .",
    "the wave function of the @xmath90 particles , like @xmath2 which decays into @xmath88 , can be formally configured as @xcite : @xmath91 similar expressiones apply to @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 cases .    in the following",
    "we explain the above mentioned techniques in a bit details .",
    "first , we consider the situation in which the meson state takes place of spin polarization discussed in preceding sections . for kaon system , there are three different kinds of eigenstates , those are : the mass , @xmath95 , and strangeness .",
    "we define the effect of @xmath96 operators acting on the @xmath0 and @xmath97 states , like @xmath98 up to an arbitrary phase . with this choice in phase",
    "the @xmath95 eigenstates can be expressed as : @xmath99 and correspondingly the mass eigenstates are : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ) can be reexpressed as : @xmath103 ) @xcite , i.e. : @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the same as in eq.([bell1 ] ) and @xmath106s represent the probabilities with subscripts in ( [ ch ] ) suppressed . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we chose the following states as the quasi - spin : @xmath107 then , the inequality ( [ cpviolation ] ) turns to be @xmath108 where @xmath109 means the coincident rate while on one side it is found to be @xmath110 and on the other side is found to be @xmath0 .",
    "the same notation applies to @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "substitute ( [ kaon1 ] ) and ( [ kaon2 ] ) into ( [ wigner_kaon ] ) , the inequality becomes @xcite : @xmath113 which is obviously violated by the experimental measurements on @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that as @xmath12 taken to be @xmath115 , ( [ cpviolation ] ) becomes @xmath116 @xcite , and it will be always true .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the ( [ cpin ] ) is taken at the beginning time , when the entangled kaon pairs are not well separated ; what tested is only the contextuality rather than non - locality .    as mentioned in above",
    ", we can also choose different time to measure the final states , the kaons , on each side .",
    "for illustration , we choose the quantum number of strangeness as the quasi - spin in our consideration , but neglect the cp violation effect , which in some sense is a good approximation",
    ".    with the time evolution , the initial entangled state , like in ( [ kaonentangle ] ) , becomes : @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote left side and right side , suppose we name the two entangled particles to be left and right without lose generality .",
    "chooseing different measurement time for two sides , we have the coincident rate @xcite : @xmath119 here , @xmath120 represents the probability of finding @xmath121 on the left side at time @xmath122 and @xmath121 on the right side at time @xmath123 .",
    "the expectation value of correlation is : @xmath124 inserting this correlation directly to chsh inequality , one can immediately find that the violation of inequality depend on the ratio of @xmath125 @xcite , where the @xmath126 characterizes of strangeness oscillation and the @xmath127 characterizes the weak decays . for the case of @xmath7 being small , that means the oscillation is dominated by the weak decays , there will be no violation of chsh inequalities . among the known neutral mesons ,",
    "only @xmath128 system has a big enough experimental value of @xmath7 , and hence the violation of inequalities might be found there @xcite .",

    ", the non - zero probability of @xmath175 leads to the non - zero probability of @xmath110 on both sides .",
    "however , due to epr s criterion of  physical reality \" this is in contradiction with eq.([4.4 ] ) .",
    "this kind of contradiction need a null measurement of the transition probability of eq.([4.4 ] ) that can not be strictly performed . starting from ( [ eber ] ) bramon _ et al . _",
