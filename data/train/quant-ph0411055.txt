    "recent progress in the coherent control of light - matter interactions has led to many interesting possibilities and practical applications . amongst them",
    "is the concept of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , first proposed by harris @xcite , in which a strong coherent field (  control \" ) is used to make an otherwise opaque medium transparent near atomic resonance for a second weak (  probe \" ) field .",
    "this eit scheme can be used to store and retrieve the full quantum information in a weak probe field by changing the strength of the control field while the pulse is inside the atomic sample @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine in detail an alternative method of retrieving the stored information that was first proposed by matsko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and investigate the parameter regime under which this process is feasible .",
    "the usual way of retrieving the stored information consists of a time - reversed version of the writing process @xcite .",
    "the elegant physics behind this scheme was described by fleischhauer and lukin , who noted that the combined atomic and optical state adiabatically follows a dark state polariton @xcite .",
    "the  writing \" process involves turning the control field to zero , storing the quantum information of the light beam as the purely atomic form of the polariton .",
    "when the control field is returned back to its original value , the polariton switches back to photonic form , identical to original optical pulse . in work",
    "describing some of the detailed behavior of that process , matsko _ et al .",
    "_ noted an alternate scheme that may also store and reproduce a copy of a weak probe pulse @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", the writing process remains the same , but retrieval of the pulse involves applying a coherent control field to the transition originally coupled by the probe field .",
    "this causes the probe pulse to be regenerated on the transition originally coupled by the control field .",
    "this alternative scheme can not be explained in terms of dark state polaritons , and behaves quite differently for different parameters of the system .",
    "we analyze this scheme in detail in this paper .",
    "as it is important to distinguish between the different control fields applied at different times , we will refer to the control field as the  writing \" field during the first part of the process ( storage ) and as the  retrieval \" field during the second part ( the regeneration of the probe pulse ) .",
    "we will show that when the collective atom - light coupling strength for the retrieval beam is the largest of the two transitions , retrieval is possible and the retrieved pulse is amplified , time reversed , stretched or compressed in time and phase conjugated compared to the input pulse .",
    "conversely , if the collective coupling strength of the retrieval beam is not the largest of the two transitions , we find that the retrieved pulse differs substantially from the input pulse and the retrieval process can lead to the creation of a soliton - like combination of electromagnetic fields and atomic coherences that propagates without change in shape .",
    "to analyze the system we use a quasi one - dimensional model , consisting of two copropagating pulses passing through an optically thick medium of length @xmath0 consisting of three - level atoms .",
    "the atoms have two metastable ground states @xmath1 and @xmath2 which interact with two fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 as shown in figure [ threelevel ] .",
    "@xmath5 are the slowly varying amplitude related to the positive frequency part of the electric field given by @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the resonant frequency of the @xmath8 transition and @xmath9 the quantization volume , here taken as the interaction volume .",
    "as the pulses are co - propagating we are able to neglect doppler effects .        to perform a quantum analysis of the light - matter interaction",
    "it is useful to use locally - averaged atomic operators .",
    "we take a length interval @xmath10 over which the slowly - varying field amplitudes do not change much , containing @xmath11 atoms , where @xmath12 is the atomic density and @xmath13 is the cross sectional area of the pulses , and introduce the continuous atomic operators @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the position of the @xmath16th atom and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 state wavefunction for the @xmath16th atom ..    using these continuous atomic operators , the interaction hamiltonian under the rotating wave approximation is given by @xmath19 dz \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the length of the cell , @xmath20 is the number of atoms in the interaction region and the coupling constants are @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dipole moments of the @xmath25 where the @xmath26 are phenomenological decay rates and we have defined the two rabi frequencies as @xmath27 and the constants and are the collective atom - light coupling constants for the transitions @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "we now proceed to consider the modified version @xcite of the storage and retrieval scheme using dynamic eit . with all the atoms",
    "initially optically pumped into the ground state @xmath30 , we turn on the writing beam driving the @xmath31 transition to its maximum value @xmath32 , while a small input pulse of maximum amplitude @xmath33 is sent into the medium on the @xmath34 transition .",
    "eit effects cause the group velocity of the the input pulse to be drastically reduced to a new value given by @xcite @xmath35 which can be much less than the speed of light .",
    "this leads to significant spatial compression of the input pulse as it enters the medium , allowing the entire pulse ( the typical pulse length outside the cell is of order of a few kilometers ) to be stored inside a vapor cell ( of length a few centimeters ) .",
    "once the input pulse is completely inside the medium , we slowly turn off the writing beam on the @xmath31 transition .",
    "this writes the information carried by the input pulse onto a collective atomic coherence for storage @xcite .    after a controllable storage time @xmath36",
    ", the stored information can be retrieved by turning on a retrieval beam driving the @xmath37 transition as proposed in @xcite .",
    "note that this is in contrast to the usual retrieval scheme for eit light storage in which the retrieval beam is on the @xmath31 transition and the output pulse is generated on the @xmath28 transition @xcite . for normal eit in the ideal case ,",
    "the output pulse is identical to the input pulse . here , because the time reversed version of the writing beam is on the @xmath38 transition , the output pulse is generated on the @xmath39 transition . as a consequence",
    "the output pulse need not have the same frequency or polarization as the input pulse .",
    "it is not immediately clear why any fields made by this process would be correlated with the stored pulse .",
    "after all , the original pulse produces a small population in state @xmath40 and leaves most atoms in state @xmath41 , so the control beam is mainly interacting with states that have not been affected by the original pulse in any significant way . also , as the strong retrieval beam is initiated on the most populated transition",
    ", it will lead to significant spontaneous emission , which would appear to dominate any kind of coherent process necessary for the retrieval .",
    "however , as will be shown later , our simulation indicates that under some parameter regimes , it is indeed possible to recover an output related in amplitude and phase to the input pulse .",
    "we will start with an example that illustrates a successful pulse retrieval , and then go on to analyze other possible behaviors of this system .",
    "we assume standard atomic initial conditions for eit given by @xmath42 ; @xmath43 . in order to better identify the properties of the new retrieval scheme and to judge the quality of the retrieval process ,",
    "we choose an input pulse at @xmath44 to be the sum of two gaussians of different height ( so the total input pulse is non - symmetric ) with a time - varying phase factor .",
    "the boundary conditions for the fields at @xmath44 is of the form @xmath45",
    "\\label{omegapin } \\\\",
    "\\omega_c(0,t ) & = & \\frac{\\omega_c^0}{2 } \\left [ 1 - \\tanh \\left ( \\frac{t - t_{off}}{t_s } \\right ) \\right ] \\label{omegacin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a unit amplitude envelope function .",
    "the first part of equation ( [ omegapin ] ) describes the input ( signal ) pulse that we wish to store , whereas the second part of equation ( [ omegapin ] ) describes the turning on of the retrieval beam ( amplitude @xmath32 ) at time @xmath47 with a switching time of approximately @xmath36 . @xmath48 describes the turning off of the writing beam at time @xmath49 .",
    "these boundary conditions for the fields are plotted in figure [ inputpulses ] .    with these initial conditions ,",
    "the equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) can be solved numerically in the moving frame defined by @xmath50 , @xmath51 using the method described in shore @xcite implementing the numerical integration with a fourth order runge - kutta method @xcite . for convenience ,",

    "amplitude of pulses are displayed in units of @xmath61 .",
    "the input pulse to be stored is @xmath54 before the start of storage .",
    "the retrieved pulse is @xmath48 after the storage process.,width=340,height=302 ]    , @xmath62 , @xmath63 cm .",
    "the input pulses are as shown in figure [ inputpulses ] . the large amplitude on the retrieval pulse transition at earlier times is because the field on this transition was used as the writing beam initially .",
    "similarly the large value on the input pulse transition at later times represents the retrieval beam.,width=302,height=302 ]    figure [ result1 ] shows a comparison of the phase and amplitude of the retrieved and input pulses , both propagating in the positive @xmath64 direction . in practice , this output pulse of well - defined shape will be superimposed on top of spontaneously emitted photons , so for the purposes of observing this output , it would be better to choose the lowest atomic density allowed for eit to work .    from the graphs , we observe that the retrieved pulse is time reversed , amplified , widened in time and is the phase conjugate of the input pulse . we can understand this behavior by examining the interaction of the retrieval beam with the stored coherence and how the retrieved pulse is generated . as the writing part of our process is identical to the usual dynamic eit setup @xcite , we know that at the end of the storage process , the only variable of the system aside from @xmath65 that is significantly nonzero is @xmath66 whose spatial variation , shown in figure [ stored ] , encodes the phase and amplitude information of the original input pulse .     during storage.,width=302,height=302",
    "]    . in region",
    "i , all atoms are in state @xmath2 . the beam has not yet penetrated to region iii.,width=302,height=132 ]    the retrieval beam enters the medium driving the transition @xmath37 while almost all the atoms are in state @xmath30 .",
    "as the medium is optically thick , the retrieval beam is strongly absorbed and its initial wavefront moves across the medium at a speed much less than the speed of light .",
    "the spatial variation of the retrieval beam at any time during the retrieval process has the general shape shown in figure [ retrievalbeam ] . at any time",
    ", this shape divides the medium into three regions with distinct dynamics . in region",
    "i , the retrieval beam @xmath54 has attained its maximum value as it has optically pumped all atoms into the state @xmath67 . in region",
    "ii , the wavefront of the retrieval beam is severely attenuated due to absorption and in region iii , not yet reached by the retrieval beam , all the atoms are still in the polariton state left by the writing process .",
    "this means that most of the atoms are in state @xmath68 here .",
    "we note that at any point in time , the interesting dynamics related to the retrieval of the stored information is occurring only in region ii . in this region",
    "the retrieval beam @xmath54 is in the process of pumping atoms from @xmath30 to @xmath69 at a rate of @xmath70 .",
    "before a significant population has accumulated in @xmath71 , the retrieval beam can coherently scatter off the stored coherence @xmath66 , generating a retrieved pulse on the @xmath72 to @xmath67 transition .",
    "these generated photons will encode some of the properties of the input pulse and propagate out of the medium at the speed of light through region iii , as this region contains only atoms in @xmath30 .    on long time - scales optical pumping alters @xmath66 and will overwrite any coherence that was initially stored there . at this point",
    ", photons emitted when atoms decay from @xmath69 to @xmath71 will bear no relation to the input pulse .",
    "furthermore , any field on the @xmath31 transition will be strongly damped due to the significant population in state @xmath67 .",
    "note that in contrast to the adiabatic following in the usual eit procedure @xcite , the retrieval process here is non - adiabatic and as demonstrated in figure [ popa](a ) , the population in the excited state @xmath69 can be quite significant during the retrieval process .",

    "a significant population resides in the excited state during the retrieval process .",
    "b ) @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "the spike in the graph shows the effect of optical pumping by the retrieval beam which overwrites the stored coherence.,width=302,height=264 ]    using this description of the dynamics , one can explain many of the features exhibited by the retrieved pulse .",
    "the time reversal occurs because the wavefront of the retrieval beam moves slowly from left to right , so the part of the stored coherence that is closest to the cell entrance sees the retrieval beam first .",
    "this part of the coherence near the medium entrance corresponds to the tail end of the input pulse ( i.e. the part of the input pulse that entered the cell last ) , so the tail end of the input pulse will be retrieved first , resulting in an output that is time reversed .",
    "figure [ result1 ] also demonstrates that the retrieved pulse can be amplified , and in this particular example the amplitude is increased by a factor of about twenty .",
    "this occurs because the new retrieval scheme has a larger reservoir of atoms available for producing photons . in the normal eit setup photon number in the retrieved pulse",
    "is limited by the number of atoms in state @xmath71 during the storage process which is strictly less than the number of photons in the input pulse .",
    "in this scheme the number of photons generated is limited by the maximum number of atoms in state @xmath2 that the medium can sustain without destroying the stored coherence .",
    "this is a property of both the size of the stored coherence and the medium ( e.g. optical density ) .",
    "it is , however , independent of the properties of the retrieval beam . for an optically dense medium ,",
    "this is generally much larger than the number of photons in the input pulse .",
    "twice the value in figure [ result1 ] .",
    "we see that the retrieved pulse is made earlier in time and narrower in time because of the increased pumping rate by the retrieval beam .",
    "all other parameters are identical to those in figure [ result1].,width=302,height=264 ]    it is also clear that the width of the retrieved pulse is determined by the speed at which the wavefront of the retrieval beam propagates across the medium and not the initial pulse length .",
    "figure [ result4 ] shows the retrieved pulse when the amplitude of the retrieval beam is doubled compared to figure [ result1 ] while keeping all other parameters identical .",
    "we see that the output pulse is narrower and its amplitude larger while the total number of photons ( as indicated by the area underneath the graph of intensities ) remains approximately the same .",
    "this is due to the the more intense retrieval beam now being able to pump atoms out of @xmath30 at a higher rate , enabling it to move across the medium more quickly and ensuring a shorter time interval between the retrieval of the front and back part of the original input pulse . since the total number of generated photons is unaffected by the intensity of the retrieval beam , energy conservation necessitates that the retrieved pulse has greater amplitude .",
    "the phase conjugation of the output pulse is most easily understood by examining the equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) and ( [ rhobb ] ) . on a short time scale",
    ", we have @xmath76 , and the following set of equations describes the generation of the retrieved pulse from the conjugate of the stored coherence @xmath77 @xmath78 since @xmath77 stores the conjugate of the input phase , the retrieved pulse is therefore the phase conjugate of the input pulse .    from examining the phase of the generated output field compared to the input ,",
    "it is clear that the quality of the retrieval process , ( in terms of extracting a pulse of the same shape as the time reversed input ) is not perfect .",
    "for example , from figure [ result1 ] ( b ) , we see that the phase of the retrieved pulse fails to decay to zero after a certain time .",
    "this feature is even more prominent when we set the collective atom - light coupling constants to be equal @xmath79 , as shown in figure [ result2 ] .",
    "again we see that the phase of the retrieved pulse plateaus , this time near the peak of the second gaussian . increasing @xmath80 further to move into the regime @xmath81",
    ", we see from figure [ result3 ] that the quality of the retrieval process is so bad that the output pulse does not even display the characteristic double peak of the input pulse .",
    "is due to the arrival of the retrieval beam at the exit of the cell @xmath82 which pumps all atoms into state @xmath67 and prevents any field existing on this transition .",
    "the parameters are @xmath83 , @xmath84 cm .",
    "the input pulses are as given in figure [ inputpulses],width=302,height=264 ]     < @xmath85 , @xmath63 cm",
    ". the input pulses are as given in figure [ inputpulses].,width=302,height=264 ]    to further investigate the behavior of the retrieved pulse as the relative strength of the collective coupling constant is varied , we consider a gaussian input envelope as this makes clearer the difference in retrieval quality .",
    "figure [ gaussamp ] show the three cases @xmath86 , @xmath79 , and @xmath87 .",
    "( a ) , @xmath88 ( b ) and @xmath89.,width=302,height=264 ]    for @xmath90 , the generation of the output pulse automatically ceases so that the retrieved pulse will always display the falling end of the gaussian input .",
    "however , as @xmath80 approaches the value of @xmath91 , the pulse generation takes a longer time to cease giving the assymetric long tail shape shown in figure [ gaussamp ] ( a ) . when @xmath92 , eventually a constant value of the generated field is maintained until the retrieval beam reaches the exit of the cell and pumps all the atoms to @xmath67 .",
    "continuing the trend , figure [ gaussamp ] ( c ) shows that in the regime of @xmath93 , the generated pulse amplitude grows until the retrieval beam has optically pumped all the atomic population into @xmath71 .",
    "the phase variation of the retrieved pulse confirms the general trend that quality of the retrieval process decreases as we move across the three parameter regimes .",
    "our numerical results strongly indicate the existence of a soliton solution at the critical point @xmath79 . at this point",
    "the field @xmath48 generated from the stored coherence is able to induce a nonzero coherence @xmath66 by a co - operative action with the retrieval beam @xmath54 .",
    "the induced @xmath66 in turn can then be used to generate @xmath48 .",
    "this steady state cycling action explains why the system can continue to generate an output even when the dynamic region ( region ii in figure [ retrievalbeam ] ) has moved beyond where the input pulse was originally stored . more specifically , when @xmath90 , the induced coherence is not large enough to maintain the cycling action , causing the effect to die out ; if @xmath79 , the effect is self sustaining where the induced @xmath66 is just sufficient to maintain the value of @xmath48 that generated it ; and for @xmath89 , a greater coherence ( @xmath66 ) is induced , leading to an output at the cell exit that is continually amplified in time until cut off by the arrival of the retrieval beam .",
    "however , we have observed that when the cell length is increased , the amplitude of the output pulse appears to tend to a limiting value .",
    "figure [ samercb ] shows the induced @xmath66 , @xmath54 and @xmath48 for @xmath79 when the initially stored coherence no longer exists .",
    "we note that the shape and size of @xmath66 and the fields propagate unchanged across the cell , indicating behavior characteristic of solitons .",
    "we also found that the shape and size of the final output is independent of the values of the coherences originally stored , indicating that the final field - coherence formation is a characteristic of the system independent of the storage / retrieval process requiring an initial nonzero @xmath94 coherence only as a seed .",
    "to demonstrate analytically that our results are in fact solitons we substitute the ansatz @xmath95 , @xmath96 into equations ( [ motion ] ) for the case @xmath79 , where @xmath97 is the soliton parameter that designates the constant speed with which the soliton propagates across the medium .",
    "this allows us to determine the following relationship between the two pulses and the coherence generated as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the collective light - atom coupling constant identical for both transitions and @xmath100 .",
    "we also obtain the following relationship between the limiting values of the two fields     ( dash ) , @xmath101 ( dash - dot ) and @xmath102 ( solid ) as a function of @xmath64 at times @xmath103 ( a ) , @xmath104 ( b ) , @xmath105 ( c ) for @xmath92 case",
    ". the field and atomic coherence propagates together unchanged across the cell , width=302,height=264 ]    @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "when we compare equations ( [ coherencegen ] ) and ( [ limitvalues ] ) against the results of our numerics for various soliton parameters ( the soliton parameter can be changed by varying the amplitude of the retrieval beam ) , we find good agreement .",
    "after further elimination of all the atomic variables , we obtain the two soliton equations relating the two fields @xmath108    -   \\gamma \\left[\\omega_p \\frac{d \\omega_c^{\\ast}}{ds } \\right . & - & \\left .",

    "=   - \\omega_p \\omega_c^{\\ast } \\left ( \\frac{|\\omega_p^{\\infty}|^2}{v } \\right . & - & \\left .",
    "\\frac{\\alpha_0}{c - v } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath109 systems has previously been considered @xcite    in conclusion , we have demonstrated the feasibility of an alternative retrieval scheme for dynamic eit under certain parameter regimes and provided physical explanations for its behavior .",
    "our numerical simulation also demonstrated the ability of this new scheme to create soliton - like features that are sensitive to the relative coupling strength of the two transitions . due to its sensitivity to parameter change",
    ", we believe this solitonic behavior could prove useful within the context of magnetometry or high precision measurement .",
