    "the atmospheric , solar and laboratory neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite have confirmed that neutrinos have tiny but nonzero masses , of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon is elegantly explained by the seesaw mechanism @xcite , in which neutrinos acquire small majorana @xcite or dirac @xcite masses naturally .",
    "furthermore , the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe can be generated through leptogenesis @xcite in the neutrino seesaw scenario .",
    "on the other hand , various cosmological observations @xcite provide strong evidence that the expansion of our universe is accelerating due to the existence of dark energy .",
    "one possible explanation for the dark energy has its origin in a dynamical scalar field , such as the quintessence @xcite with an extremely flat potential .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) provides an attractive realization of the quintessence field .",
    "a striking coincidence between the scales of neutrino masses and dark energy ( @xmath1 ) , inspires us to consider them in a unified scenario , i.e. , the neutrino dark energy model which generically predicts neutrino - mass variation @xcite .",
    "there have been lots of recent activities studying the neutrino dark energy models .",
    "a possible connection between the neutrinos and the pngb dark energy was explored in the type - i seesaw scenario@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new neutrino dark energy model to simultaneously explain the generation of neutrino masses and the origin of dark energy from the higgs sector . in particular , the pngbs associated with neutrino mass - generation provide the consistent candidates of dark energy while the small neutrino masses depending on the dark energy field are realized through the type - ii seesaw .",
    "furthermore , the cp - violation and out - of - equilibrium decays of the higgs triplets produce the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "we extend the @xmath2 standard model ( sm ) with triplet and singlet higgs scalars , @xmath3 \\delta^{0}_{ij } & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\delta^{+}_{ij}\\end{array } \\right \\rgroup\\,\\,(\\textbf{3},1)\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\chi_{ij}^{}&\\equiv&\\chi_{ji}^{}\\,\\,(\\textbf{1},0)\\,,\\quad ( \\textrm{for}~ i , j=1,2,3),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are left - handed lepton doublets , higgs doublet , higgs triplets and higgs singlets , respectively .",
    "the full lagrangian is supposed to be invariant under a global @xmath4 symmetry , generated by the independent phase transformations of each higgs triplet among the six @xmath5 fields .",
    "transformations of the higgs singlets @xmath6 under this @xmath4 are determined by requiring the invariance of the following scalar interactions , @xmath7 where we have defined the sm higgs doublet @xmath8 as a singlet under @xmath4 .",
    "the higgs triplets have the yukawa couplings to the left - handed lepton doublets , @xmath9 which explicitly break the @xmath4 down to its subgroup @xmath10 .",
    "so we have only three massless nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngbs ) after the six @xmath6 s acquire their vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "we write down the relevant lagrangian for the higgs and lepton - yukawa interactions , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are dimensionless while @xmath15 has mass - dimension equal one .",
    "after the higgs singlets get their vevs , @xmath16 , we can write @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the neutral bosons and the ngbs , respectively . among these six ngbs",
    ", three of them will acquire nonzero masses via the coleman - weinberg potential ( due to the small explicit breaking of global symmetries , @xmath19 ) and thus become pngbs .",
    "the other three remain massless as the result of spontaneous breaking of the subgroup @xmath20 .    for convenience ,",
    "we redefine the higgs triplets as @xmath21 the mass matrix @xmath22 for the physical triplet scalar fields is now given by @xmath23^{\\!\\frac{1}{2}}_{}\\!\\!\\!.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the vevs of @xmath24 s generate the effective trilinear interactions between the higgs triplets and doublet , @xmath25 where the cubic couplings @xmath26 will be set as real after proper phase rotations . from eqs.([xinew ] ) , ( [ masstriplet ] ) and ( [ cubic ] ) , we derive the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian1 ] ) as below , @xmath27\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we still have the freedom to redefine the phases of the three lepton doublets , which can remove three of the fields @xmath28 from the lepton - higgs yukawa interactions . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose the rephasing , @xmath29\\psi_{li}^ { } & \\rightarrow&\\psi_{li}^{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which transforms the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) into a new form , @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "it is not possible to remove @xmath34 from eq.([lagrangian3 ] ) by any further transformations and hence these @xmath35 s will become the pngbs with tiny masses and can naturally serve as the candidates of dark energy .",
    "note that from ( [ xinew ] ) , ( [ derivative ] ) and the subsequent phase rotations on the right - handed charged leptons , the three massless ngbs , @xmath36 , will only have the derivative interactions to other fields , but they are highly suppressed by @xmath37 and thus escape from experimental constraints at low energy scales .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking takes place with the vev of the higgs doublet , which induces small vevs to the triplets , @xmath38 with @xmath39 , where the vevs of the higgs triplets @xmath5 are deduced as @xmath40 inspecting eqs.([masstriplet ] ) and ( [ cubic ] ) , it is natural to take the masses @xmath41 around the same order as the scalar cubic couplings @xmath26 since they are both controlled by the singlet vevs ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "hence , the triplet vevs in ( [ vev ] ) are seesaw - suppressed by the ratio of the electroweak scale @xmath42 over the heavy mass @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "these small vevs will then generate the majorana masses for the neutrinos , @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 . with the @xmath47 symmetric mass - matrix ( [ mass1 ] )",
    ", we can readily realize the neutrino mass - spectrum and mixings , consistent with the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "moreover , the interactions of the neutrinos with the pngbs will induce a small long - range force , which can have direct consequences in cosmology @xcite and neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "three of the ngbs , @xmath48 as defined in ( [ combination ] ) , will acquire small masses due to the yukawa couplings between the left - handed lepton doublets and the higgs triplets , and thus become the pngbs . as shown in fig .",
    "[ potential ] , the leading loop diagram will contribute a coleman - weinberg effective potential for @xmath49 . similar to @xcite , we explicitly calculate the potential , @xmath50 where @xmath51 as a function of @xmath49 is the _",
    "_ k__th eigenvalue of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "a typical term in @xmath54 that contributes to the potential of a pngb field @xmath55 has the form , @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "it is well known that with @xmath32 of the order of planck mass @xmath58 , the pngb @xmath55 will acquire a mass of order @xmath59 and thus provides a consistent candidate for the quintessence dark energy .",
    "finally , we also note that after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the explicit breaking of the @xmath20 symmetry is only generated by the dimension-3 soft mass term in eq.(15 ) .",
    "so , in this model there is no dimension-4 term which explicitly breaks @xmath20 , and thus there are no higher order correction that could contribute a divergent term to spoil the renormalizability and the original symmetry of the theory .",
    "this point can be checked by explicit calculations as well .",
    "for instance , at the two - loop order , we have @xmath60\\ , . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath61 is independent on the pngbs as well as @xmath62 , we see that the two - loops have no contribution to the effective potential for the pngbs .",
    "similarly , there is no contribution from other higher loops .",
    "the decays of higgs triplets , @xmath63 can break the lepton number . as shown in fig.[decay ] , the mass - mixings in ( [ masstriplet ] ) among different higgs triplets contribute the tree - level and one - loop diagrams that interfere to generate cp asymmetry in these decays .",
    "the decays of the triplet higgs will then produce enough lepton asymmetry before the electroweak phase transition , which can successfully explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe through the sphaleron processes@xcite which convert the lepton asymmetry into the existing baryon asymmetry .    to calculate the cp - asymmetry",
    ", we define the higgs triplets in their mass - eigenbasis , @xmath64 with the diagonalized mass - eigenvalues , @xmath65 thus we can rewrite the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian3 ] ) as @xmath66 with the definition @xmath67 and @xmath68 here @xmath69 is an orthogonal rotation matrix .",
