    "dynamical processes around supermassive black holes ( sbh ) in quasars , blazars and active galactic nuclei are characterized by violent phenomena , leading to formation of jets and other outbursts . here",
    "we consider a model problem for a shell outburst from a sbh surrounded by a dense massive stellar cluster due to a pure gravitational interaction of shells oscillating around sbh .",
    "investigation of spherical stellar clusters using shell approximation was started by hnon @xcite . in this approximation a stellar cluster is considered as a collection of spherical stellar shells .",
    "each shell consists of stars with the same specific angular momenta and energies . in the process of motion",
    "the angular momenta are conserved while energies are changing , yet taking the same values for all the stars in one shell .",
    "the shell itself stay spherical .",
    "shell approximation has been successfully applied for investigation of stability @xcite , violent relaxation and collapse @xcite , leading to formation of a stationary cluster .",
    "investigation of the evolution of a spherical stellar cluster taking into account various physical processes was done on the base of the shell model in the classical series of papers of l. spitzer and his coauthors @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations of a collapse of stellar clusters in theshell approximation @xcite have shown , that even if all shells are initially gravitationally bound , after a number of passages through each other some shells obtain sufficient energy to be thrown to infinity .",
    "here we consider a simplified problem of motion of two massive spherical shells , each consisting of stars with the same specific angular momentum and energy , around sbh .",
    "development of chaos during the motion of two gravitating intersecting shells was found first by miller and youngkins @xcite in an oversimplified case of purely radial motion and reflecting inner boundary . in @xcite chaotic behavior",
    "was found in a more realistic model considering stars with the same specific angular momentum and energy dispersed isotropically over the spherical shell , and each star moving along its ballistic trajectory in the gravitational field of the central body and shells . in the current paper we consider the same model mainly in the case when one can neglect the influence of one ( `` light '' ) shell onto the motion of another ( `` heavy '' ) shell . in this simplified case",
    "we describe a structure of the phase space and obtain the scaling laws for the measure of the domain of chaotic motion and for the minimal energy of the light shell sufficient for its escape to infinity .",
    "we follow the approach which was used in @xcite for analysis of chaotic dynamics and escape to infinity in the planar restricted circular three body problem .",
    "this approach consists of constructing asymptotic formulas for poincar return map and identification of regions of regular and chaotic dynamics in the phase space of this map .",
    "region of regular dynamics is the region where kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) guarantees existence of many invariant curves of the map .",
    "these curves are barriers preventing the escape to infinity .",
    "region of chaotic motion is the region where the phase expansion criterion ( see , e.g. @xcite ) is satisfied . in this region",
    "chaotic diffusion allows the `` light '' shell to gain positive energy and then escape to infinity .",
    "one special property of the system under consideration is that for an open set of the problem s parameters , in the phase space there is a region where the poincar return map is continuous but not smooth ( it has a singularity of the square root kind ) . in this region",
    "neither kam - theory nor phase expansion criterion are applicable .",
    "similar situation , though with a map that is discontinuous in a certain region in the phase space occur in the problem of motion of three gravitating parallel impenetrable sheets @xcite . for general analysis of maps with discontinuities see @xcite and references there .",
    "the dynamics of a system of many gravitating spherical shells was studied from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics in @xcite where , however , the escape to infinity was not studied because a bounded system was considered .",
    "an extensive study of escape to infinity in the rectilinear three body problem was performed in @xcite .",
    "consider the motion of two stellar shells with masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 around the central body of mass @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be specific angular momenta of shells . consider the case when @xmath5 , so that one can neglect the influence of the second shell onto the motion of the first shell .",
    "we call this problem a restricted problem by the analogy with the restricted three body problem in celestial mechanics ( the latter problem describes the motion of an asteroid under the action of sun and jupiter ) .    in what follows the first shell",
    "will be called the heavy one , and the second shell will be called the light one .    in the restricted problem , motion of the heavy shell",
    "is described by hamiltonian function @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the momentum canonically conjugated to the shell radius @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the change of @xmath8 in time is the same as in the kepler problem for a satellite with mass 1 and angular momentum @xmath3 and a central body of mass @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 the behavior of @xmath8 is described by usual formulas of the elliptic keplerian motion : @xmath11 ; here @xmath12 is the mean anomaly of the satellite , i.e. the angular variable for which @xmath13 motion of the light shell is described by hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the momentum canonically conjugated to radius @xmath17 of the light shell . in the hamiltonian @xmath18",
    "one should consider @xmath8 as a given function of time .",
    "therefore , in the restricted problem motion of the light shell is described by a hamiltonian system with one and a half degrees of freedom ( one degree of freedom plus explicit dependence of the hamiltonian on time ) .",
    "this model applies just as well to the case where the light massless shell is replaced by a massless point .",
    "consider the motion of the light shell . at the time moments",
    "@xmath19 , when @xmath17 has a local minima on the trajectory , we mark on the cylinder @xmath20 the values of the light shell hamiltonian @xmath18 and of the heavy shell mean anomaly @xmath21 . thus we obtain on @xmath22 a sequence of points @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath23 @xmath25 @xmath26@xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "this sequence terminates at the right if the shell escapes to infinity .",
    "it can be terminated at the left as well , but the terms of this sequence with numbers smaller than certain negative number do not have physical meaning .",
    "the points of the constructed sequence are mapped to each other under the action of poincar return map defined as follows .",

    "the initial value of @xmath17 satisfies the equation @xmath35 .",

    "the map @xmath42 preserves the area @xmath46 on @xmath22 ; this follows from preservation of the phase volume by a hamiltonian system ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    together with map @xmath42",
    "we will use modified return map @xmath47 defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath48 be the same as before . denote by @xmath49 the value of @xmath18 at the last preceding to @xmath36 time moment when @xmath17 has a maximum . denote by @xmath50 the value of @xmath18 at the first time moment after @xmath36 when @xmath17 has a maximum .",

    "this is the reason why for mall @xmath49 map @xmath65 is more convenient for the analysis than @xmath42 . in what follows",
    "we omit for brevity the symbol `` @xmath66 '' over @xmath67 .    in what follows",
    "we consider the case when the heavy shell s mass is much smaller than the mass of the central body : @xmath68 . in this case map",
    "@xmath47 has the form @xmath69 @xmath70 functions @xmath71 can be extended as continuous functions up to the argument value @xmath72 .",
    "the value @xmath73 is the sum of jumps of the light shell s potential energy due to passage of shells through each other between two consecutive time moments when the light shell radius takes maximal values .",
    "to find of @xmath74 , one should calculate the sum of the energy jumps under the assumption that motion of the light shell is not affected by the heavy shell ( i.e. this motion is keplerian one with total energy @xmath33 ) .",
    "depending on the properties of the shell motion at @xmath75 , one can define three main types of @xmath33 values .",
    "at all initial phases @xmath34 of the heavy shell motion , the light shell on the period of its motion passes through the heavy shell at non - zero relative velocity .",
    "( if @xmath72 , i.e. motion of the shell stars is parabolic , then in this and following definitions one should consider as a period of the light shell motion the whole infinite time interval between arrival of the shell from infinity and its departure to infinity . ) in this case during a period of the light shell motion the number of passages of shells through each other is the same for any initial phase of the heavy shell motion .",
    "therefore , the number of terms in the sum for @xmath76 is the same for any @xmath34 . at small enough @xmath77",
    ", the sum for @xmath78 has the same number of the terms .",
    "therefore , function @xmath79 is analytic in @xmath80 , and it can be continued analytically in some neighborhood of a circle around @xmath72 .",
    "there exists certain initial phase @xmath81 of the heavy shell motion such that at some time moment the shells superimpose with zero relative velocity and non - zero relative acceleration , and absolute velocities of both shells at this moment are different from zero . at this moment trajectories of the shells",
    "have quadratic tangency .",
    "when @xmath34 deviates from @xmath81 in one direction , the superimposing of the shells disappears .",
    "when @xmath34 deviates from @xmath81 in another direction , this superimposing decomposes into two close shell crossings ( say , light shell surpasses the heavy one and then almost immediately the heavy shell surpasses the light one ) . in this latter case",
    "two new terms appear in the sum for @xmath82 ; these terms are close by absolute values , and they have different signs .",
    "the sum of these terms is of order @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , in this case function @xmath82 has at @xmath84 the singularity of type @xmath85 or @xmath86 . at small variations of @xmath33",
    "this singularity persists .",
    "function @xmath78 has the same singularity at small @xmath77 .",
    "value @xmath17 that corresponds to time moment of tangency of shell trajectories is uniquely defined .",
    "indeed , at the moment of tangency there should be @xmath87 ( because velocities of the shells are equal to each other ) and @xmath88 .",
    "these conditions define a unique value of @xmath17 .      for any initial phase @xmath34 of the heavy shell motion",
    "the shells never superimpose .",
    "then at small enough @xmath77 motion of the light shell is also keplerian .",
    "there is also exceptional intermediate type of @xmath33 for which the shells can meet with zero velocities ( i.e. one of two extremal values of radius of one shell coincide with an extremal value of radius of another shell ) , but with nonzero relative acceleration .",
    "another exceptional case is @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in this case for some initial phase @xmath34 of the heavy shell the radii of two shells coincide all the time .",
    "let us consider first the case when the value @xmath72 is of type a. consider in cylinder @xmath22 the annulus @xmath91 such that all values @xmath33 on this annulus are of the type a ( here @xmath92 is a constant , @xmath93 does not depend on @xmath77 ) . in this annulus",
    "the map @xmath47 is analogous to `` kepler map '' , which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "let us repeat for map @xmath47 the analysis from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the trajectories of several initial points under the action of map @xmath47 for this case are shown in fig .",
    "the properties of the map to large extent are determined by the phase expansion coefficient @xmath94 . in our case relations ( [ ch4 ] ) , ( [ ch5 ] )",
    "imply that @xmath95 in the region where @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 with a big enough positive constant @xmath98 , map @xmath47 satisfies the assumptions of kam - theory . according to kam theory , this region is filled up to a residual set of small measure by invariant curves of map @xmath47 that enclose cylinder @xmath22 ( i.e. values of @xmath34 along any of these curves cover all segment @xmath99\\ ; mod\\ ; 2\\pi$ ] ) and are close to curves @xmath100 const .",
    "the residual set of small measure is filled up to another residual set of much smaller measure by invariant curves that do not enclose cylinder @xmath22 ( i.e. values of @xmath34 along each such curve cover only a part of segment @xmath99\\ ; mod\\ ; 2\\pi$ ] ) .",
    "these invariant curves are organized into `` islands '' corresponding to different resonances . for phase points on invariant curves",
    "the motion of the light shell is quasi - periodic ( in particular case , periodic ) . for a phase point not on invariant curves the motion of the light shell can be chaotic .",
    "however , because the trajectory of the phase point on @xmath22 remains locked between invariant curves , the light shell can not acquire the positive energy and escape to infinity .",
