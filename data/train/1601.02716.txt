    "a spinor bose - einstein condensate is a quantum degenerate gas in which the atoms are able to access their spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition to being a superfluid , this system can exhibit various types of magnetic ordering depending on the interaction parameters and externally applied fields ( e.g.  see @xcite )",
    ". there has been significant progress in the field with the development of novel methods for measuring aspects of spin order in the condensate ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "it is of interest to understand the rich excitation spectrum of this system , which should exhibit phonon and various magnon branches .",
    "these excitations reveal aspects of the ordered phases ( e.g.  broken symmetries @xcite ) , and can play an important role in the dynamics that occurs when the system transitions between magnetic phases ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "also , it has recently been shown that the excitation spectrum of a spinor condensate exhibits the elusive quantum mass acquisition process ( where a massless quasiparticle becomes massive by quantum corrections ) @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical proposals for spinor condensate spectroscopy @xcite and fluctuation measurements @xcite that are sensitive to the nature of the excitations , but are not energy and momentum resolved .",
    "one important recent step made in experiments has seen the measurement of the long wavelength magnon dispersion relation in a particular phase of a spin-1 condensate using an interferometric technique @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider an alternative scheme for probing a spinor condensate with a bragg spectroscopy technique that is energy , momentum and spin sensitive .",
    "bragg spectroscopy is a commonly used experimental tool for probing a wide range of properties in ( non - spinor ) condensates , such as dynamic and static structure factors @xcite , the momentum distribution and coherence @xcite , and to detect vortices @xcite and roton - like features @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea in bragg spectroscopy is to use a stimulated two - photon process to scatter atoms in an energy and momentum resolved manner , with the system response subsequently determined by measuring the amount of excitation ( e.g.  momentum or energy transfer to the system ) .",
    "bragg spectroscopy is in some sense analogous to neutron scattering , which is also used to measure the dynamic structure factor in condensed matter systems and was used to confirm the energy - momentum spectrum of excitations of superfluid helium @xcite . because neutrons have a magnetic moment they are also able to probe magnetic degrees of freedom , and neutron scattering was used to make the first direct measurement of the magnon dispersion relation in magnetite @xcite .",
    "similarly , by performing bragg spectroscopy using a two - photon process that is dependent on the spin state of the atoms , it will be possible to probe the magnetic structure of the condensate and its excitations .",
    "the polarization of light can be used to effect such a spin - dependent coupling @xcite , and was basis of a proposal to measure the structure factor of two - component gases .",
    "finite detuning of the two - photon process can also be used to arrange a spin - dependence in bragg spectroscopy , and has been successfully applied in recent experiments with a strongly interacting ( two - component ) fermi gas @xcite . while there has been prior work in aspects of the spin - dependent spectroscopy ( or related dynamic structure factors ) in fermi gases ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , the case of a spinor condensates has gone largely unexplored .",
    "the spin dependent bragg spectroscopy technique we propose involves two steps to make a measurement : * ( i ) * the system is excited by a weak spin - dependent bragg probe of adjustable wavevector and frequency , i.e.  moving optical dipole potential that has a vectorial coupling to the atomic hyperfine sub - levels . * ( ii ) * the momentum or energy imparted to the system is subsequently measured to quantify the system response .",
    "such measurements are then repeated on an identically prepared spinor condensate for a range of bragg frequencies , and often different wavevectors .",
    "we note that this technique only differs from the usual bragg spectroscopy technique for scalar condensates by the spin - dependence of the excitation probe .",
    "as noted above , there are several ways to produce such a spin - dependent coupling . in this work",
    "our focus is upon developing a theoretical description for this scheme in terms of linear response theory , and to relate the measured properties to density and spin - density dynamic structure factors .",
    "an important result is that these dynamic structure factors are often dominated by different excitation branches in the spinor condensate .",
    "thus with an appropriately chosen spin - dependent bragg probe it will be possible to selectively probe the density ( or phonon ) branch , or one of the magnon branches .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we begin by defining the bragg probe and observables we consider .",
    "we develop the formalism in a general manner for bosonic atoms of arbitrary integer spin @xmath0 interacting with short range rotationally invariant interactions .",
    "we use linear response theory to relate the response of the system observable after weak excitation to equilibrium dynamical correlation functions of the system .",
    "we choose to characterize these correlation functions in terms of a set of density and spin - density dynamic structure factors .",
    "we then focus on understanding their properties . using commutations relations of the full many - body hamiltonian",
    ", we derive rigorous @xmath0-sum rules that specify the first frequency moment of the dynamic structure factors as a function of the wavevector of excitation .",
    "we formulate the dynamic structure factors using meanfield ( bogoliubov ) treatment of the excitations suitable for practical calculations .",
    "finally we present the results of calculations to illustrate the behavior of the dynamic structure factors for a spin-1 condensate in the four distinct magnetic phases accessible to this system .",
    "here our interest is in spin-@xmath0 bosons described by the @xmath1-component bosonic field operator @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "it is useful to define the operators @xmath4 which describe the total , spin and nematic density , respectively , with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spin-@xmath0 matrix augmented by @xmath7 so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian for a dilute spin-@xmath0 bose gas the can be written in the form @xcite ( also see @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11{\\hat{\\psi}}_m,\\ ] ] is the spin - independent single particle hamiltonian with harmonic confinement , with @xmath12 the atomic mass and @xmath13 the trap frequency in direction @xmath14 .",
    "a uniform magnetic field is applied along @xmath15 causing a zeeman term @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the linear and quadratic zeeman energies , respectively .",
    "finally , the spinor interaction hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the interaction hamiltonian for two bosons with total spin @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the coupling constant for the spin-@xmath21 channel with @xmath23-wave scattering length @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the irreducible operator annihilating a pair of bosons at @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient @xcite .",
    "we consider a pair of laser beams in a stimulated bragg scattering configuration that are well detuned from atomic resonance , so that spontaneous emission can be neglected .",
    "this gives rise to a moving bragg potential experienced by the atoms with a wave vector @xmath28 set by the difference of the wave vectors between the two beams , moving at a speed @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the difference in frequencies of the two beams . in what follows",
    "we will take the bragg potential to be oriented along @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath31 . using the polarisation of the light @xcite or adjusting the detuning of the beams from the excited states it is possible to realize a spin - dependent coupling to the atomic field",
    "( see @xcite ) @xmath32 where the strength of the bragg potential , @xmath33 , is dependent on the laser beam intensity and detuning , and @xmath34 .",
    "we have introduced the spin - dependent density fluctuation operator @xmath35 which characterizes the coupling of the probe to the atoms at the bragg wave vector @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being a general spin - density of the system where @xmath38 is a dimensionless @xmath39 coupling matrix . for the case of standard ( spin - independent ) bragg spectroscopy , the probe only couples to the total density , and @xmath40 .",
    "most methods considered for producing a spin - dependent coupling do not result in a potential that couples to only a single component of spin density , but have both density and spin - density terms , of a form dependent on the scheme employed . here",
    "we will make a reasonably general choice for the coupling matrix @xmath41 so that it couples to the density and spin - density .",
    "this choice encompasses two important cases .",
    "the polarisation dependent proposal for spin-@xmath42 fermi gases in @xcite is obtained by taking @xmath43 , and the detuning based scheme employed in @xcite for a spin - balanced fermi gas is obtained by taking @xmath44 for real @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "other cases will be possible , e.g.  by varying the polarization of the light fields ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .      complementing the bragg probe is the scheme used to observe the effect on the condensate .",
    "here we present two observables suitable for this purpose .",
    "we emphasise that both of these observables are commonly used for measuring the response of spinless bose gases ( e.g.  see @xcite ) and two - component fermi gases ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , and will be applicable to the spinor gas .",
    "the first observable we examine is the rate of momentum imparted to the condensate , which is initially at rest . for our case with the bragg wave vector along @xmath15",
    "we consider the @xmath15-component of momentum @xmath47 from which the observable is obtained by evaluating the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath48 under the influence of the perturbation @xmath49\\rangle,\\\\ & = -m\\omega_z^2z -\\frac{ik v } 2 ( { \\langle \\delta { \\hat{b}}^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle } e^{-i\\omega t}-{\\mathrm{c.c.}}),\\label{eq : pzrate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50,\\label{e : deltab}\\]]@xmath51 signifies equilibrium expectation , and @xmath52 is the @xmath15-component of the centre of mass coordinate . in experiments",
    "@xmath53 is initially zero , and can be assumed to remain small if the bragg pulse is sufficiently short compared to the trap period in the scattering direction .",
    "the value of @xmath54 ( and hence the rate @xmath55 ) is then typically determined by allowing the system to freely expand ( i.e.  turning the harmonic confinement off ) at the conclusion of the bragg pulse and measuring the centre of mass displacement of the system .",
    "an alternative observable is the rate at which energy is imparted to the cloud by the perturbation ( e.g.  see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the observable is the unperturbed hamiltonian operator for the system @xmath56\\rangle , \\\\ & = -\\frac{v}{2}\\frac {   d{\\langle \\delta { \\hat{b}}^\\dagger_{{\\mathbf{k } } } \\rangle}}{dt } e^{-i\\omega t } + { \\mathrm{c.c.}},\\label{eq : erate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be measured by holding the system in trap until it rethermalizes , and then measuring the increase in temperature .",
    "we assume that the system starts in an equilibrium state of the ( unperturbed ) hamiltonian , @xmath57 , and using linear response theory we obtain results for the evolution of the fluctuations @xmath58 ( see appendix [ s : linresp ] ) .",
