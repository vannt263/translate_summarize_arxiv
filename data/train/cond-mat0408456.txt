    "rapid progress in fabrication and measurement techniques of artificially sanitized ferromagnetic nanostructures revealed a variety of new phenomena .",
    "for instance , in contrast to the bulk case , it has been found that the magnetoresistance associated with nanosize dws can be very large.@xcite a notable example are the experiments on ni microjunctions , which show that constrained dw formed at the contact of ferromagnetic wires results in a large electrical resistance , leading thus to a huge negative magnetoresistance.@xcite further insight is provided by recent measurements of the magnetoresistance ( found to be @xmath0 ) in semiconducting magnetic nanoconstrictions.@xcite this latter example is particulary interesting insofar as the extent of dws ( i.e. the width @xmath1 ) formed in magnetic nanoconstrictions can be on the atomic scale@xcite and considerably smaller than the fermi wavelength of charge carriers .",
    "this situation may have important consequence as far as the the influence of dw on the transport properties is concerned .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical descriptions of the transport properties of dws are mainly restricted to smooth dws , typical for bulk or thin film ferromagnetic materials.@xcite results of these studies indicate that electron scattering from smooth dws is rather weak , and the spin of an electron propagating across the wall follows magnetization direction almost adiabatically .",
    "the contribution of smooth dws to electrical resistance can be then calculated within the semiclassical approximation , and has been found to be either positive or negative  but in general it is rather small .",
    "we recall , however , that the condition for the applicability of the semiclassical approximation is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fermi wavevectors for the majority and minority electrons , respectively .",
    "this condition is fulfilled in bulk ferromagnets .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath5 , the semiclassical approximation is no longer valid and the scattering of electrons from the ( sharp ) dws has to be considered strong .",
    "therefore , various attempts have been put forward to understand the influence of sharp dws on transport properties .",
    "for instance , tagirov _",
    "et al_@xcite considered dws in magnetic junctions as a potential barriers independent of the electron spin orientation .",
    "they concluded that the presence of dw results in a large magnetoresistance .",
    "furthermore , ballistic electron transport through dws was investigated numerically.@xcite recently , the ballistic motion through a nanocontact has been studied by zhuravlev et al,@xcite who found a large magnetoresistance effect due to the presence of a nonmagnetic region within the constriction considered as a one - channel wire .",
    "the one - dimensional model of a sharp dw has been considered in ref .",
    "[ ] in the limit of @xmath6 .",
    "it has been shown there that the problem can be viewed as transmission through a spin - dependent barrier .",
    "this results in substantial magnetoresistance that increases when the spin polarization of electrons is enhanced .",
    "the largest magnetoresistance is thus expected for a fully spin - polarized electron gas .",
    "@xcite    a question which is still not yet addressed concerns the role of spin - orbit interaction in the scattering from a sharp dw .",
    "an analysis of this aspect is highly desirable in view of the relevance of spin - orbit interaction in spintronic devices , as evidenced by recent measurements.@xcite generally , the spin - orbit coupling can mix the spin channels , in addition to the mixing caused by the spin - dependent scattering from the dw .",
    "as demonstrated in this work , the presence of the spin - orbit interaction ( of the the rashba type ) results in an increase of the magnetoresistance due to dw . in the present work",
    "we also address briefly the role of localization corrections .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic narrow channel with a single magnetic dw . in the continuous model",
    "the spin density ( magnetization ) is a function of the coordinate @xmath7 ( along the channel ) , @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 varies continuously from zero to @xmath10 for @xmath7 changing from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , the magnetization is oriented along the axis @xmath7 for @xmath13 , and points in the opposite direction for @xmath14 . in what follows",
    "we assume that the dw width @xmath1 is less than the fermi wave length @xmath15 of the charge carriers .",
    "this limiting case is appropriate for dws formed at constrained magnetic contacts , in particular for low - density magnetic semiconductors , where @xmath15 can be quite large .",
    "for the description of the conduction electrons in the semiconductor we assume a parabolic band model . magnetic polarization of the wire is associated with splitting of the spin - up and spin - down electron bands ( we take the quantization axis along @xmath7 ) .    due to",
    "the spatial variation of the magnetization @xmath16 , spin - flip scattering of electrons may occur within the domain wall .",
    "in addition , for a sharp dw the spin - up electrons propagating along the axis @xmath7 are reflected from the effective potential barrier at @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the strongest effect of dws on the electronic transport can be expected in the case of a full spin polarization of the electron gas , i.e. when there are no spin - down electrons at @xmath18 , and no spin - up electrons at @xmath19 .",
    "this limit is reached when @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the exchange integral , and @xmath22 is the fermi energy in the absence of magnetization .",
    "we recall that @xmath22 characterizes the total electron density @xmath23 of the semiconducting material , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron effective mass .",
    "hence , the condition ( @xmath20 ) of full spin polarization becomes particularly satisfied when a depletion region near the dw exists .",
    "as mentioned above , the condition of sharp dw means that the wall width is smaller than the electron fermi wavelength , i.e. @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the electron fermi wavevector . this condition can be easily fulfilled in semiconductors , especially in the case of low electron concentration .",
    "in addition , when dw is laterally constrained , the number of quantum transport channels can be reduced substantially . in the extreme case",
    "only a single conduction channel can be active .",
    "the corresponding condition is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the wire width .",
    "this condition can be easily obeyed in semiconductors with low density of carriers .",
    "an important element of the model is the presence of spin - orbit interaction . under the condition of full spin polarization",
    ", the spin - flip scattering provides mixing of different spin channels , that is responsible for the transfer of electrons through the domain wall .",
    "thus , one can expect strong influence of spin - orbit interaction on the total resistance . in the following we assume the spin - orbit interaction in the form of rashba term .",
    "such an interaction is usually associated with the asymmetric form of the confining potential leading to size quantization in quantum wells and wires .",
    "the model hamiltonian we analyze in this work has the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the parameter of spin - orbit interaction , whereas @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the pauli matrices .",
    "we choose the axis @xmath34 to be normal to the wire and assume that the magnetization in the wall rotates in the @xmath34-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit interaction in eq .",
    "( 1 ) corresponds to the axis @xmath35 perpendicular to the substrate plane .",
    "the magnetization vector rotates then in the substrate plane .",
    "although the one - dimensional model describes only a single - channel quantum wire , it is sufficient to account qualitatively for some of the recent observations .",
    "in addition , the present model can be generalized straightforwardly to the case of a wire with more conduction channels ( large width and/or higher carrier concentration ) .",
    "our treatment is based on the scattering states . for electrons incident from left to right ,",
    "the asymptotic form of such states ( taken sufficiently far from dw , @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 @xmath38 in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 are defined as @xmath41 ^{1/2}/\\hbar $ ] and @xmath42 ^{1/2}/\\hbar $ ] , respectively , whereas the other parameters are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . here , @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 and @xmath49 denotes the electron energy .",
    "due to spin - orbit interaction , electron states are superpositions of spin - up and spin - down components . for simplicity",
    ", we call them in the following either spin - up or spin - down waves , because they reduce to such waves in the limit of vanishing spin orbit interaction . thus , the scattering state ( 2),(3 ) describes the spin - up wave incident from @xmath11 to the right , which is partially reflected and partially transmitted into the spin - up and spin - down channels .",
    "the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the transmission amplitudes without and with spin reversal , respectively , whereas @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the corresponding reflection amplitudes .",
    "even though there are no minority carriers far from the domain wall , the corresponding wavefunction components exist in the vicinity of the domain wall and decay exponentially in the bulk .",
    "similar form applies to the scattering states @xmath54 describing electrons incident from the right to the left .    when @xmath55 , the reflection and transmission coefficients can be calculated analytically . upon integrating the schrdinger equation @xmath56 ( with the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , and assuming @xmath59 , one obtains @xmath60 for each scattering state ( @xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 equation ( 4 ) has the form of a spin - dependent condition for electron transmission through a @xmath63-like potential barrier located at @xmath17 and was obtained assuming @xmath55 .",

    "thus , at first glance one might expect that a nonzero spin - orbit interaction mixes the spin channels and leads to nonvanishing transmission through the wall , even in the limit of very thin domain wall .",
    "this is however not the case since the matching condition for the wave functions at @xmath78 and @xmath79 requires that both incident and transmitted waves are certain superpositions of spin - up and spin - down components . on the other hand ,",
    "equation ( 9 ) indicates that transmission through the wall decreases with increasing strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",

    "we have analyzed the role of localization corrections in the case of sharp dw .",
    "qualitively , it can be described as the dw induced suppression of the quantum interference in triplet cooperon channel.@xcite the singlet channel in ferromagnets is strongly suppressed by the internal magnetization.@xcite the suppression of the interference by dws is related to dephasing of the wave function of electron transmitted through the barrier.@xcite if the transmission through the wall is small , the corresponding dephasing length roughly equals to the distance of electron moving from a point @xmath7 ( within the constriction ) to the domain wall position ( @xmath17 ) , and the dephasing time is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the diffusion coefficient . after averaging over @xmath7 of the localization correction @xmath102",
    ", we find that the characteristic dephasing length @xmath103 is the constriction length itself , @xmath104 .",
    "in the case of sharp dws , the localization correction diminishes the magnetoresistance due to the reflection from the wall , since it has a different sign .",
    "we have presented a theoretical description of the resistance of a semiconducting magnetic nanojunction with a constrained dw in the case of a full spin polarization of electron gas . in the limit of @xmath55 , the electron transport across the wall",

    "for such a narrow and constrained dw , the electron spin does not follow adiabatically the magnetization direction , but its orientation is rather fixed . however , dw produces some mixing of the spin channels .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction essentially enhances the magnetoresistance , whereas the localization corrections play the opposite role .",
