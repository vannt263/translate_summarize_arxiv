    "many real - world biological and technological systems display rich dynamics , often leading to increasing complexity over time that appears to be limited only by availability of resources .",
    "an example is the evolution of biological complexity : the history of life on earth has displayed a trend of continual evolutionary adaptation and innovation , giving rise to an apparent open - ended increase in the complexity of the biosphere over its @xmath0 billion year history @xcite .",
    "other complex systems , from the growth of cities @xcite , to the evolution of language @xcite , culture @xcite and the internet @xcite appear to exhibit similar trends of innovation and open - ended dynamics . producing computational models that generate sustained patterns of innovation over time , which elucidate the fundamental mechanisms driving open - ended dynamics in both natural and artificial systems",
    "is therefore an important goal in modeling complex systems , with implications for research in diverse fields ranging from biological evolution to artificial life and artificial intelligence .    despite the significance of realizing open - ended evolution in theoretical models ,",
    "progress in this direction has been hindered by lack of universally accepted definitions for _ open - ended evolution _",
    "although relevant to many fields , oee is most often discussed in the context of artificial life , where the problem is so fundamental that it has been dubbed a `` millennium prize problem '' @xcite .",
    "many working definitions exist , which can be classified into four hallmark categories as outlined by banzhaf _",
    "_ @xcite : ( 1 ) on - going innovation and generation of novelty @xcite ; ( 2 ) unbounded evolution @xcite ; ( 3 ) on - going production of complexity @xcite ; ( 4 ) a defining feature of life @xcite .",
    "each of these faces its own challenges , as each is cast in terms of equally ambiguous concepts .",
    "for example , `` innovation '' or `` novelty '' , `` complexity '' and `` life '' are all notoriously difficult to formalize in their own right .",
    "it is also not apparent whether `` unbounded evolution '' is physically possible since real systems are limited in their dynamics by finite resources , finite time , and finite space .",
    "a further challenge is identifying whether the diverse concepts of oee are driving at qualitatively different phenomena , or whether they might be unified within a common conceptual framework .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that increasing complexity might not itself be a hallmark of oee , but instead a consequence of it @xcite .",
    "likewise , processes may appear unbounded , even within a finite space if they can continually produce novelty within observable dynamical timescales @xcite .",
    "given these limitations , it is unclear at present if oee is a property unique to life , is inclusive of its artifacts ( such as technology ) , or is an even broader phenomenon that could be a universal property of certain classes of dynamical systems .",
    "many approaches aimed at addressing the hallmarks of oee have been inspired by biology @xcite , primarily because biological evolution is the best known example of a real - world system with the potential to be truly open - ended @xcite . however , as stated , other examples of potentially open - ended complex systems do exist , such as trends associated with cultural @xcite and technological @xcite growth .",
    "therefore , we develop a more general framework to seek links between the four aforementioned hallmarks within dynamical systems , while remaining agnostic about biology . our motivation is to discover universal mechanisms that underlie oee as it occurs both within and outside of biological evolution .    in dynamical systems",
    "theory there exists a natural bound on the complexity that can be generated by a finite deterministic process , which is given by the _ poincar recurrence time_. roughly , the poincar time is the maximal time after which any finite system returns to its initial state and its dynamical trajectory repeats .",
    "clearly , new dynamical patterns can not occur past the poincar time . to cast the concept of oee as unbounded evolution firmly within dynamical systems theory",
    ", we introduce a formal minimal criteria for _ unbounded evolution _ ( where we stress that here we mean the broader concept of dynamical evolution , not just evolution in the biological sense ) in finite dynamical systems : minimally , an unbounded system is one that does _ not repeat _ within the expected poincar time .",
    "this definition automatically excludes finite deterministic systems unless they are open to an environment .",
    "a corollary is that systems satisfying this minimal definition for unbounded evolution must also satisfy a formal notion of _ innovation _ , where we define innovation as dynamical trajectories _ not _ observed in isolated systems",
    ". a system can exhibit oee _ if only if _ it is both _ unbounded _ and _ innovative_. both proposed definitions are _ extrinsic _ , depending on interaction with an environment , and rely on comparison to counterfactual histories ( those of isolated systems ) .",
    "the utility of adopting these definitions is that they provide a simple way to quantify intuition regarding hallmarks ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of oee for systems of _ finite _ size , which is applicable to _ any _ dynamical system .",
    "to demonstrate this broad applicability we implement new variants of cellular automata ( ca ) , which utilize the rule space of elementary cellular automata ( eca ) .",
    "we introduce these as a case study to explore mechanisms potentially satisfying our formalized definitions of oee and innovation .",
    "each variant differs in its relative openness to an external environment and implements time - dependent update rules . of the variants",
    "tested , our results indicate that systems that implement rules that are a function of the state of the system are statistically better at satisfying the two criteria for oee . given that state - dependent dynamics are often cited as a hallmark feature of life @xcite",
    ", this provides a new connection between hallmarks ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) of oee .",
    "we then explore these state - dependent systems in more depth , calculating general complexity measures including compressibility ( based on lzw in  @xcite ) and lyapunov exponents .",
    "we show that the state - dependent systems provide a _ scalable _",
    "mechanism for generating oee that includes the capacity for on - going production of complexity by coupling to larger environments .",
    "thus the results connect all four hallmarks of oee in a new framework that is suggestive of mechanisms that might operate in a diverse range of dynamical systems .",
    "the framework therefore holds promise for providing insights into universal mechanisms for generating oee in dynamical systems , which is applicable to both biological and artificial systems .",
    "in what follows , we consider discrete dynamical systems @xmath1 , which implement rules drawn from a set @xmath2 that operate on a finite set of states @xmath3 .",
    "we first introduce a rigorous notion of oee that relies on formalized definitions of unbounded evolution and innovation , before describing three new variants of cellular automata ( ca ) with time - dependent rules and varying degrees of openness to an environment , designed to test mechanisms capable of satisfying these formal definitions .",
    "we consider definitions of unbounded evolution and innovation that are applicable to _ any _ instance of a dynamical system @xmath1 that can be decomposed into two interacting subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "nominally , we refer to these subsystems as the `` organism '' ( @xmath4 ) and `` environment '' ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we note that our framework is sufficiently general to apply to systems outside of biology . here",
    "the concept of `` organism '' is meant to stress that it is only in this subsystem that we expect to potentially observe the rich dynamics intuitively expected of oee .    since the poincar recurrence time @xmath6 of a finite",
    ", deterministic dynamical system provides a natural bound on when one should expect the system to repeat , we minimally define _ unbounded evolution _ ( ue ) as occurring only in cases that locally defy this expectation in the subsystem @xmath4 , and therefore appear unbounded given finite resources :    [ def : ue ] * unbounded evolution ( ue ) * : a system @xmath1 , which can be decomposed into subsystems @xmath7 and @xmath8 that interact according to a function @xmath9 , exhibits unbounded evolution if there exists a recurrence time @xmath10 such that @xmath11 or a time @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is non - repeating for @xmath14 or @xmath15 , where @xmath6 is the poincar recurrence time for an equivalent isolated system @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the states and rules , respectively , in the dynamical evolution of @xmath4 .    here ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath12 are the recurrence time of the state- and rule- trajectory of @xmath4 , respectively ( denoted by @xmath9 ) , @xmath19 is the state of @xmath4 , @xmath20 is the rule of @xmath4 , @xmath21 is the state of @xmath5 ( see table s1 for full list of model parameters in the supplement ) .    by definition [ def : ue ] , a dynamical system exhibits ue _ if and only if _ it may be partitioned such that the sequence of one of its subsystems states _ or _",
    "dynamical rules are _ non - repeating _ within the expected poincar recurrence time @xmath6 of an equivalent isolated system . here , _",
    "equivalent _ is meant to include _ all _ systems evolved from any state drawn from the same set possible of states @xmath22 with a fixed rule drawn from the same set of dynamical rules @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we include _ dynamic _ rules in our definition since , as will we describe below , it is only systems with time - dependent rules that we expect to satisfy definition [ def : ue ] _ and _ definition [ def : inn ] for innovation introduced below .",
    "we will describe implementations using explicit examples of elementary cellular automata ( eca ) in section _ model implementation _",
    ", where @xmath26 is the set of states with the binary alphabet @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the set of eca rules .",
    "eca are defined as 1-dimensional ca with nearest - neighbor update rules : for an eca of width @xmath29 , equivalent isolated systems as defined here include all trajectories evolved with _",
    "any _ fixed eca rule from _ any _ initial state of width @xmath29 , where @xmath6 is then @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the width of @xmath4 .    implementing this definition of ue necessarily depends on counterfactual histories of _ isolated _ systems ( _ e.g. _ of eca in our examples ) .",
    "these counterfactual systems can not , by definition , generate conditions for ue .",
    "this suggests as a corollary a natural definition for innovation in terms of comparison to the same set of counterfactual histories :    [ def : inn ] * innovation ( inn ) * : a system @xmath1 , which can be decomposed into subsystems @xmath7 and @xmath8 that interact according to a function @xmath9 , exhibits innovation if there exists a recurrence time @xmath33 such that @xmath34 is not contained in the set of all possible state - trajectories @xmath35 for an equivalent isolated ( non - interacting ) system @xmath7 .",
    "a motivation for including both definitions [ def : ue ] and [ def : inn ] is that they encompass intuitive notions of `` on - going production of novelty '' ( inn ) and `` unbounded evolution '' ( ue ) , both of which are considered important hallmarks of oee .",
    "we note that the combination of the two definitions does not necessitate that the complexity of individual states increase over time , thus one might observe inn without a corresponding rise in complexity with time .",
    "importantly , the combination of definitions [ def : ue ] and [ def : inn ] excludes trivial cases .",
    "for example , some non - bounded systems could in principle satisfy ue , but not inn since the dynamics might be equivalent to those generated from an appropriately constructed isolated system ( _ e.g. _ a larger eca in our example ) .",
    "an example is the time evolution of eca rule 30 ( by wolfram s classification @xcite ) , which is known to be a ` complex ' eca rule that keeps generating novel patterns in open - boundary conditions . in this case",
    ", it should be considered that it is the openness of the system that is generating continual novelty and not an _ internal _ mechanism .",
    "since we aim to understand the _ intrinsic _ mechanisms that might drive oee in real , finite dynamical systems , we require both definitions to be satisfied for a dynamical system to exhibit non - trivial oee .",
    "we evaluate different mechanisms for generating oee against definitions [ def : ue ] and [ def : inn ] , utilizing the rule space of elementary cellular automata ( eca ) as a case study .",
    "eca are defined as nearest - neighbor 1-dimensional ca operating on the two - bit alphabet @xmath36 .",
    "there are @xmath37 possible eca rules , which we numerically label following wolfram s heuristic classification @xcite . due to their relative simplicity ,",
    "eca represent some of the most widely - studied ca , thus providing a well - characterized foundation for this study .",
    "traditionally , eca evolve according to a fixed dynamical rule starting from a specified initial state . as such",
    ", no isolated finite eca can meet the criteria laid out in definitions [ def : ue ] and [ def : inn ] .",
    "an isolated eca of width @xmath29 will repeat its pattern of states by the poincar time @xmath38 ( violating definition [ def : ue ] ) .",
    "if we instead considered a ca of width @xmath29 as a subsystem of a larger eca it would not necessarily repeat within @xmath39 , but it would _ not _ be innovative ( violating definition [ def : inn ] ) .",
    "thus , as stated , we can exclude trivial examples such as eca rule 30 , or other unbounded but non - innovative dynamical processes , which repeatedly apply the same update rule .    to exclude trivial unbounded cases , definitions [ def : ue ] and [ def : inn ] necessitate that the dynamical rules themselves evolve in time . as we will show , utilizing the set of @xmath37 possible eca rules as the rule space for ca with _ time - dependent _ rules makes both ue and inn possible .",
    "rules can be stochastically or deterministically evolved , and we explore both mechanisms here .",
    "specifically , we explore three new ca variants that evolve according to explicitly time - dependent rules , where the time dependence takes on different functional forms for each .",
    "we note that there exists a huge number of possible variants one might consider .",
    "we therefore focus on three variants that display important mechanisms implicated in generating oee , including state - dependent dynamics ( regarded as a hallmark feature of life @xcite ) , openness to an environment @xcite , and stochasticity . here",
    "openness to an environment is parameterized by the degree to which the rule evolution of @xmath4 depends on the state ( or rule ) of @xmath4 versus the state of @xmath5 : completely open systems are regarded as depending only on external factors , such that the time - dependence of the rule evolution is _ only _ a function of the environment .    the first variant , * case i * , implements _ state - dependent _ update rules , such that the evolution of @xmath4 depends on its own state _ and _ that of its environment . for simplicity , to model a dynamic environment @xmath5 we utilize the eca rule space , where @xmath5 evolves according to a _ fixed _ rule ( such that @xmath5 is an eca ) .",
    "the subsystem @xmath4 , by contrast , updates its own rule according to a function @xmath9 such that @xmath40 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the state and rule of the organism and @xmath21 is the state of the environment ( see supplement for details ) .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath4 are therefore _ self - referential _ @xcite , and we regard this case as only partly open to an environment since @xmath4 depends on its own state .",
    "we note that the qualitative features observed are not dependent on the precise functional form of @xmath9 , so long as @xmath9 is a function of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( that is , @xmath4 is self - referential _ and _ open  see @xcite for an example of non - open self - referencing ca that do not display oee ) .    the second variant , * case ii * , is completely open to an external environment @xmath5 , which fully dictates the rule evolution of @xmath4 . as with case i , the environment",
    "@xmath5 is an execution of an eca .",
    "the subsystem @xmath4 updates its rule according to a function @xmath9 such that @xmath41 . as such",
    ", the rule implemented in @xmath4 depends _ only _ on the state of an the external system @xmath21 .",
    "we consider @xmath4 in this example to be more open to its environment than for case i , as here @xmath9 does not depend on @xmath19 or @xmath20 .    the final variant , * case iii * , is also open to an external environment",
    ", however the environment here is a stochastic `` heat bath '' and not an eca .",
    "the subsystem @xmath4 updates its rule according to a function @xmath9 such that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 introduces noise to the system , such that if the noise is above a threshold value @xmath44 the rule is `` mutated '' ( see supplement ) .",
    "the rule evolution of @xmath4 follows a diffusive random walk through the eca rule space . in this example , @xmath4 is also more open to its environment than in case i ( since @xmath9 does not depend on @xmath19 ) , but it is less open than case ii since @xmath9 does depend on @xmath20 .",
    "the three variants are summarized in table [ tab : cas ] ( additional details in supplement ) .",
    "since we restrict the rule space for cases i  iii to that of eca rules only , the trajectories of eca with periodic boundary conditions provides a well - defined set of isolated counterfactual trajectories with which to evaluate definitions 1 and 2 . for comparison to isolated systems ,",
    "we evaluate _ all _ eca with widths equivalent to @xmath32 , the width of the `` organism '' subsystem @xmath4 .",
    "we test the capacity for each of the three cases presented to generate oee , against definitions 1 and 2 in a statistically rigorous manner , and compare the efficacy of the different mechanisms implemented in each case .",
    "figure  [ fig : rt2 ] shows box - whisker plots of recurrence times for each ca variant explored as described in section  [ sec : rectimes ] .",
    "in addition to these statistics , @xmath45 cases were explored for case i @xmath46 , case ii , and case iii ca .",
    "none of these statistics showed examples of oee @xmath4 , but larger @xmath47 in case i ca did display few cases of oee @xmath4 for @xmath45 ( data not shown do to small data set size ) .",
    "case iii ca generate fewer oee cases than case i as the width of the organism increases , with no cases observed in our statistical sample for @xmath48 .",
    "case i sdca also lack oee cases for @xmath48 but the fraction of oee cases drops off less dramatically as a function of @xmath32 than as observed for either case ii or case iii ca .",
    "the frequency distribution of recurrence times observed in our sampled data sets for case i , case iii , and case ii ca are shown in figures  [ fig : comparemu ] and  [ case2stem ] , respectively .",
    "the data indicates that for equivalently sized ensembles of sampled trajectories for case i , case ii , and case iii ca , the case i ca generate oee cases with higher statistical certainty than either the case ii or case iii ca .    in comparing these results to the scalability of the three cases we note that case ii is not scalable since it would require changing the structure of the rules of the organism @xmath4 .",
    "the mutation rate @xmath44 is important in determining the distribution of @xmath49 , and thus the scalability for case iii . for smaller and smaller @xmath44 the distribution of timescales @xmath49 increases",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : smallmu ] . in the context of biological evolution ,",
    "the mechanism for increasing the number of oee cases under case iii would therefore be for systems to evolve toward _ slower _ mutation rates over time .",
    "however , because the distributions are exponentially distributed , the number of oee cases is always a small tail of the distribution .",
    "a fixed width @xmath32 could always be found in a _",
    "large enough _ statistical sample that such that @xmath50 , where @xmath10 is the recurrence time case i ca with an equivalent organism width @xmath32 .",
    "in general , this statistical sample will be much larger for case iii ca of a given mutation rate @xmath44 than for case i ca which are coupled to a large environment ( figure  [ fig : mu2 ] ) .",
    "oee cases are therefore much rarer for case iii than case i ca .",
    "additionally , once case iii reach the terminal attractor their dynamics are not complexity , whereas case i ca will repeat an attractor state that is in general complex and is often times open - ended ( such that the attractor itself satisfies definitions 1 and 2 ) .      to determine if the complexity observed in case i ca is _ intrinsic _ to the state - dependent mechanism , or is an artifact of a selection - effect favoring complex rules , we determined the frequency of rules implemented in case i ca utilizing the wolfram classification scheme for elementary cellular automata @xcite .",
    "because these were sampled across a collection of many @xmath4 from a given environment @xmath5 , we nominally call this sampling the `` metagenomes ''",
    ". there are four wolfram classes : class i and ii the least complex , often generating simple repeating patterns .",
    "class iii rules are more complex displaying random patterns , and class iv are regarded as the most complex , displaying rich dynamical structure ( for example , eca rule 110 , which is known to be turing universal  @xcite is a class iv ca ) .",
    "the resulting rule frequency distribution is shown in figure  [ meta2 ] for all case i ca of a given @xmath32 and separately for the oee cases in figure  [ meta1 ] .",
    "the oee @xmath4 attractor statistics in figure  [ meta1 ] are the cases above the black line shown in figure  [ fig : at1 ] .",
    "the results show that case i ca primarily implement class i and ii rules , indicative that the complexity observed is _ intrinsic _ to the state - dependent mechanism .                  as a final comparison between case i and case ii ca , the @xmath51 and @xmath52 values , as defined in sections  [ sec : calc ] ,",
    "are shown in a heat map in figures  [ cvalues2 ] and  [ cvalues3 ] , and figures  [ lvalues2 ] and  [ lvalues3 ] , respectfully .",
