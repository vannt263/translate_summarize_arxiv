    "part of the dispersion of [ o / h ] is probably due to saturation effects which could not be avoided in some objects .",
    "some of the dispersion of [ n / h ] and [ ar / h ] is probably due to ionization corrections .",
    "two fundamental results can be drawn from fig.[fig : compa1 ] : ( 1 ) the abundances in the neutral gas show that this phase has been already enriched in heavy elements , and ( 2 ) the abundances in the neutral gas are systematically equal or lower than those in the ionized gas ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the neutral envelope of bcds is participating in the dispersion and mixing of heavy elements produced in massive stars",
    ". however , the neutral phase seems to be less chemically evolved than the ionized gas associated with the current star - formation episode .",
    "the interpretation of abundances in bcds has been limited so far by the lack of knowledge about the origin of the neutral gas whose absorption is detected in the fuv . while absorption - lines can arise in the cold and warm neutral medium , it must be kept in mind that there is a bias in the fuv to observe dust - free lines of sight toward the most massive stars . the direct comparison with the h  i  gas detected _ via _ the 21 cm emission in the bcds is also hampered by the fact that fuv observations only probe gas in front of stellar clusters while radio observations ( in emission ) probe the whole system .",
    "we discuss in the following the properties of the fuv lines of sight by the means of depletion calculation .",
    "depletion concerns mostly si , fe , and to a minor extent , p. the depletion strength in the neutral envelope of bcds is largely unknown , mostly because of the lack of information on the fuv lines of sight and because of the low metal content of the gas .",
    "this is an important parameter to account for to estimate the fraction of the metal underabundance in the neutral gas genuinely due to the chemical evolution .",
    "the observed abundance of an element x can be expressed as : @xmath31 } \\approx \\log(z ) + { \\rm [ x / h]}_0 + a_{\\rm x } f_*,\\ ] ] where [ x / h ] is the abundance respect to the solar value , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the intrinsic metallicity of the gas in solar units , [ x / h]@xmath34 corresponds to the initial ( minimal ) depletion , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the propensity of a given element to be depleted and @xmath37 is the sightline collective depletion strength , following the definitions of jenkins ( 2009 ) .",
    "it must be noted that [ x / h]@xmath34 depends on metallicity , being likely closer to @xmath38 in metal - poor environments because of the lower dust - to - gas ratio ( hirashita _ et al .  _ 2002 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) .    for simplicity",
    ", we make the assumption that the metallicity of the neutral gas is solar @xmath39 and try to find the depletion strength @xmath37 agreeing with the observations .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that @xmath40 is dominated by depletion on dust grains rather than a different chemical enrichment .",
    "figure[fig : depletion ] shows that @xmath37 in bcds would then be comprised between 0.2 and 1.1 ( based on the use of the most refractory element , fe ) .",
    "this is a strong upper limit because we assumed a solar metallicity . in practice , to recover the observed metallicity in the ionized gas , @xmath37 would be essentially null .",
    "the fact that @xmath41 would imply that the lines of sight are essentially dust free , intersecting uv transparent diffuse clouds .",
    "this is of course compatible with the selection effect of lines of sight in the sense that the most opaque clouds are invisible in the uv .",
    "if @xmath37 is indeed null , underabundances in the neutral gas are not due to depletion on dust grains , as it is already suggested in fig.[fig : compa1 ] by the study of n and ar ( only little depleted ) .",
    "the observed abundances of n , o , and ar can only be explained by a genuine chemical underabundance in the neutral gas .",
    "the situation for fe requires further interpretation .",
    "fe is known to deplete significantly in the _ ionized gas _ , even in metal - poor objects . in the milky way",
    ", it is thought that about 2/3 of the iron in the ism was produced by sne type ia involving low - mass stars .",
    "rodriguez & esteban ( 2004 ) and izotov _ et al .  _",
    "( 2006 ) observed that the [ o / fe ] ratio increases with metallicity in emission - line galaxies , being consistent with depletion of fe on dust grains in the ionized gas , and with iron production in sn type ii in those galaxies .",
    "hence we could be in a situation where fe is less depleted in the neutral gas @xmath14 probed along dust - free lines of sight @xmath14 than in the ionized gas .",
    "correcting for depletion of fe in the ionized gas leads to similar abundance patterns to the other elements , i.e. , an underabundance in the neutral gas ( see fig.[fig : compa2 ] and lebouteiller _ et al .  _ 2009 ) .",
    "we now assume that all the problems related to the chemical abundance determinations in the neutral gas are solved .",
    "these include ionization correction , line saturation effects , depletion in dust grains , contamination by stellar photospheres ( for h  i ) . can the results be understood in a chemical evolution scenario involving both the ionized gas and the neutral gas",
    "?      considering the mass of metals released by a starburst , several hypotheses come into play , as explained in lebouteiller _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2008 ) :    * all the metals mix in the h  ii  region alone , leading to unrealistically high abundances ( see introduction ) . * all the metals mix in the h  i  envelope . given the large mass of atomic hydrogen , the metallicity of the neutral gas would increase by @xmath42% ( calculation made for pox36 ) . *",
    "only a fraction of the metals mixes within the h  ii  gas , and the remaining mix within the h  i  gas .",
    "it is possible that the h  i  close to the clusters is enriched first .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2009 ) calculated that if metals mix with 10% of the h  i  in pox36 , the enriched h  i  would acquire the metallicity observed in the ionized gas of the h  ii  regions .    the amount of metals released by a single starburst episode can not be mixed entirely within the h  ii  gas since it would lead to unrealistic abundances .",
    "the minimal enrichment therefore applies to only a fraction of the expelled metals .",
    "a possible scenario might thus include a local enrichment in the h  ii  region of a @xmath14 small @xmath14 fraction of the metals released by the current star - formation episode while most of the metals mix in the h  i  envelope . in order to reproduce the observed abundance discontinuity between the 2 phases ,",
    "the fraction of metals mixing in the neutral gas has to satisfy to the condition : @xmath43 where @xmath44(h  ii ) and @xmath44(h",
    "i ) are the masses of the ionized gas and neutral gas respectively ( see lebouteiller _",
    "et al .  _ 2009 ) and where @xmath40 is the abundance discontinuity between the ionized gas and neutral gas as defined in sect.[sec : results ] .    in pox36",
    ", @xmath45 translates into @xmath46 of about 1% . in izw18 , @xmath47 ( following the result of lecavelier _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) translates into a fraction @xmath46 of 5% .",
    "the large difference in behavior between @xmath46 and @xmath40 in these 2 galaxies is due to the fact that the ratio of ionized gas mass over neutral gas mass is much larger in izw18 than in pox36 .",
    "the neutral gas of bcds has already been enriched with metals up to an amount of @xmath48z@xmath2 .",
    "could this value be a metallicity threshold ?",
    "the hypothesis of a minimal metallicity has been already suggested by kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) to explain the difficulty to find extremely - metal poor star - forming objects . in these objects , the current star - formation episode could pollute the ism by heavy elements released by stellar winds and supernov .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the apparent threshold of @xmath48z@xmath2 in the neutral gas of bcds is also the metallicity of the most metal - poor galaxy known , izw18 .",
    "it is conceivable that the results are related .",
    "however , they imply considerably different ( both spatial and time ) scales for the dispersion and for the mixing .",
    "interestingly , telfer _ et al .  _",
    "( 2002 ) found that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the redshift range @xmath49 has a metallicity @xmath50 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which includes the floor metallicity observed in bcds .",
    "hence it appears that the neutral and ionized ism of the lowest metallicity galaxies could well be characterized by a default enrichment rather than by previous star - formation episodes . in that view",
    ", bcds could have started to form stars only `` recently '' ( around @xmath53gyrs ago ) , from an h  i  cloud already at the igm metallicity .",
    "this has important consequences on the number of starburst episodes that occurred until now .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath54%  in izw18 ( to reproduce the result @xmath55 , sect.[sec : discon ] ) , 3 bursts are required to explain the observed metallicity if starting from a null metallicity ( calculation made using yields from meynet & maeder ( 2002 ) and assuming interphase mixing between 2 consecutive bursts ) .",
    "however , a single burst is required if starting from @xmath56@xmath2 .",
    "further observations and analysis of bcds with metallicities lower than @xmath57z@xmath2 will be needed to confirm the existence of this plateau .",
    "since a local enrichment of 100%  of the products released by a starburst would lead to unrealistically high abundances , 2 possibilities remain : ( 1 ) metals disperse and mix in another phase ( sect.[sec : discon ] ) , or ( 2 ) most of the metals are ejected into the igm .",
    "we now discuss the parameters playing a role in the ejection / retention of metals .",
    "as they end their lives massive stars explode as a supernov .",
    "the energy output from a sn is over a short period , comparable to that of a whole galaxy . in a galaxy with a high local star formation rate ,",
    "the collective action of supernov  may lead to a galactic superwind , which may cause loss of gas .",
    "stellar winds can also contribute to the energetics of the ism at the very early stage of a starburst ( leitherer _ et al .",
    "the relative importance of stellar winds compared to sne increases with metallicity .",
    "a continuous wind proportional to the star formation rate has been applied in models predicting the evolution of starburst galaxies .",
    "but since different elements are produced on different timescales , it has been proposed that only certain elements are lost ( or in different proportions ) hence reducing the effective net yield of those metals as compared to a simple chemical evolution model ( matteucci & chiosi 1983 ; edmunds 1990 ) .",
    "the sne involved in such a wind are likely to be of type ii because type ia sne explode in isolation and will less likely trigger chimneys from which metals can be ejected out of the plane of a galaxy . in this framework",
    "o and part of fe are lost while he and n ( largely produced by intermediate stars ) are not .",
    "this would result in a cosmic dispersion in element ratios such as n / o between galaxies that have experienced mass loss and those that have not . in a dwarf galaxy which has a weaker gravitational potential",
    ", these effects may result in gas loss from the galaxy unless as we argue below the presence of a low h  i  density halo acts as a barrier .",

    "this type of assumption is currently blindly used by cosmologists in their model calculations .",
    "however the indisputable presence of metals in galaxies implies that supernova products are not completely lost in all cases ( silich & tenorio - tagle 2001 ) .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2001 ) have compared silich & tenorio - tagle ( 2001 ) theoretical estimates with some well - studied starburst galaxies .",
    "they have worked out three different possible star formation history scenarios that assume either a very young coeval starburst or extended phases of star formation of 40myr or 14gyr and inferred the expected energy input rate for each galaxy using the h@xmath0 luminosity and/or the observed metallicity .",
    "values of the derived mechanical energy injection rate in the three considered cases were compared with the hydrodynamical models predictions of mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) and silich & tenorio - tagle ( 2001 ) .",
    "detailed calculations and accompanying figures are given in legrand _ et al .  _",
    "( 2001 ) ; we only present in fig.[fig : legrand ] the resulting plot for the extended phases of star formation of 40myr that might be the most realistic case for starburst galaxies .    the net result ( see fig.[fig : legrand ] ) is that all galaxies lie above the lower limit first derived by mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) for the ejection of metals out of flattened disk - like ism density distributions energized while most are _ below _ the limit for the low density halo picture .",
    "thus the mass of the extended low density halo efficiently acts as the barrier against metal ejection into the igm .",
    "disk - like models clearly require less energy to eject their metals into the intergalactic medium because the amount of blown out interstellar gas that can open a channel into the intergalactic medium is much smaller than in the spherically symmetric limit , where all of the metal - enriched ism has to be accelerated to reach the galaxy boundary . predicted haloes , despite acting as a barrier to the loss of the new metals , have rather low densities ( @xmath64@xmath65 ) and thus have a long recombination time ( @xmath66 ; where @xmath0 is the recombination coefficient ) that can easily exceed the lifetime of the h  ii  region ( @xmath67yr ) developed by the starburst . in such a case",
    ", these haloes may remain undetected at radio and optical frequencies until large volumes are collected into the expanding supershells .",

    "( 2005 ) found similar abundances in the neutral and ionized gas of the dwarf spiral galaxy sbs1543 + 593 .",
    "this results poses a fundamental question : is the metal deficiency of the h  i  gas specific to bcds ?",
    "rotation in spirals provide an efficient mixing throughout the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , star - formation keeps occurring along the spiral arms . in opposition ,",
    "bcds have weak velocity field , and star - formation usually occurs in one or several knots ( e.g. , papaderos _ et al .  _ 1996 ) . the different mode of star - formation could be responsible for substantial differences in the dispersal and mixing mechanisms .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2006 ) found that the neutral phase toward ngc604 in the spiral galaxy m33 is more metal - poor than the ionized gas of the h  ii  region , i.e. , being consistent with results in bcds , but the contamination by high - velocity clouds along the lines of sight similar to the ones observed around the milky way complicates the interpretation .",
    "it seems necessary to study the metal abundance in the neutral gas of dwarf irregular galaxies that are not bcds .",
    "studies of other star - forming objects ought to be performed , which is now possible thanks to the interactive database tool designed by desert _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2006a ) and desert _ et al .  _",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "one of the most important complication in the studies of absorption - line spectra of galaxies is the presence of unseen components , possibly saturated .",
    "this caveat is usually solved by the use of the weakest observed lines . in that vein , the hst / cos instrument enables the sulfur abundance determination in the neutral phase through the interestingly weak s  ii  @xmath68 multiplet ( pettini & lipman 1995 ) . the oxygen abundance will be measured with a better accuracy than with _ fuse _ thanks to the o  i  @xmath69 line ( meyer _ et al .",
    "furthermore , the examination of phosphorus lines will confirm the possible use of phosphorus abundance as a metallicity tracer as suggested by lebouteiller _",
    "et al .  _",
    "this is particularly important for the analysis of the _ fuse _ database since o  i  lines are generally saturated or close to saturation .",
    "finally , it must be stressed that the ideal case study for deriving abundances in the neutral gas of bcds is to observe the ism toward a quasar line of sight ( kunth & sargent 1986 ) .",
    "the method was successfully used in the dwarf spiral galaxy sbs1543 + 593 by bowen _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2005 ) but unfortunately , no alignment bcd - quasar has been observed so far .",
    "the study of such an alignment would cancel the selection effect in _ fuse _ spectra to probe gas toward star - forming regions within the galaxy .    as far as chemical models are concerned , recchi _ et al .  _",
    "( 2004 ) examined the case of izw18 for which they found that abundances in the h  i  medium ( defined by a temperature lower than @xmath70k ) are similar to those in the h  ii  gas .",
    "hence , although some physics is still missing in the models ( radiative transfer , clumpy ism , dust phase ) , it seems that fuse results still can not be reproduced .",
    "the lower metallicity observed in the h  i  gas of bcds as compared to the ionized gas of their h  ii  regions remains a puzzle .",
    "we have discussed many effects that may affect the determination of the neutral gas abundances such as ionization corrections , depletion on dust grains , stellar contamination , and line saturation .",
    "the underabundance of a factor 10 found in the h  i  region of several bcds is however so dramatic that it seems difficult all these effects can make us miss the detection of 90%  of the metals .",
    "it is possible to reproduce the abundance discontinuity in the 2 phases assuming that only a fraction ( typically a few percents ) of the metals released by the current starburst episode mix within the ionized gas , while most of them mix with the neutral envelope .",
    "the considerable mass of h  i  results in only a slight metallicity increase , even with most of the metals mixing within .",
    "the main parameter therefore concerns the ratio of ionized - to - neutral gas , in the sense that a galaxy with a large fraction of its total gas mass ionized is more likely to show similar abundances in the 2 phases .",
    "note that his hypothesis is simple speculation at this stage and it has to be tested against dispersion spatial scales and against mixing timescales .",
    "it is essential to confirm the existence of a metallicity floor .",
    "the lowest metallicities observed in the neutral gas of bcds agree with the metallicity in izw18 @xmath14 the most metal - poor star - forming galaxy known @xmath14 , suggesting a minimal enrichment regardless of the ism phase .",
    "such a minimal enrichment seems to be in agreement with the igm metallicity around a redshift @xmath71 , so that bcds might have formed only `` recently '' ( @xmath13gyrs ago ) .",
