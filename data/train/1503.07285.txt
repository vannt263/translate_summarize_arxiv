    "the experiments on solar neutrino @xcite proved that the nuclear fusion is the heat source in the core and the neutrinos have masses .",
    "now , there remains a problem on the temperature of the solar corona .",
    "the sun s temperature is @xmath0 k at the core , and @xmath1 k at the solar sphere .",
    "that is @xmath2 k at the corona region @xcite , which is higher by @xmath3 than that at the solar surface , despite the fact that the heat source is in the core .",
    "there have been many studies based on the electromagnetic interactions , using magnetic - acoustic waves , alfven waves , micro - flare reconnection , and others , which have shown that these regions are not static but dynamic of revealing many activities @xcite .",
    "new observation using satellite shows also these activities .",
    "the corona is heated not only in these active regions but also in the quiet regions , which seems contradicting with the thermodynamics . to find the heat source in the quiet region is a fundamental physical problem .",
    "hence we focus our study on the quiet region in the present paper .    because the neutrino is produced in the nuclear fusion , about 10% of the initial energy produced at the core is carried by the neutrino .",
    "its interaction with matter is quite weak of the cross section @xmath4 and of a mean free path longer than @xmath5 m at the density , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 mev .",
    "neutrinos have been considered not to interact with the corona .",
    "it is noted that these values are obtained using the transition rate obtained from fermi s golden rule and its equivalent formula of s - matrix in the relativistic field theory , which are valid only if the initial and final waves do not overlap @xcite and behave like particles .",
    "the neutrino and photon are waves of large extensions in the corona , and the transition probability @xmath8 gets modified and has a new term @xmath9 in addition to the standard @xmath10-linear term @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the time - interval between the initial and final states @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath9 has origins in the overlap of the waves and consequently is very different from @xmath13 and becomes huge for the neutrino radiative process in the corona owing to the tiny photon s effective mass .",
    "@xmath14 in the neutrino - photon interactions is ignorable due to landau - yang - gell - mann theorem @xcite , and by a tiny transition magnetic moment @xcite , but due to @xmath9 the neutrino radiative transition occurs @xcite .    here",
    "we consider @xmath9 of the neutrino radiative process in the corona region .",
    "the corona has a magnetic field and free electrons , which reveals the hall effect , which is expressed in quantum theory by a chern - simons form of the electromagnetic potential .",
    "the form is proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electron density and @xmath17 is the magnetic field , and agrees with a topological invariant .",
    "that is materialized as a macroscopic quantum phenomenon such as the quantized hall effect in two - dimensional semi - conductors @xcite , and is used as the standard of the electric resistance .",
    "in the corona , the lamor oscillation in a mean free path is larger than unity , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the mean free path and the velocity of the electrons .",
    "the electrons are expressed by landau levels , which differs from a weak @xmath17 expansion @xcite .",
    "a system of electrons , photons , and neutrinos in the external magnetic field in the 3rd - direction are described by the lagrangian @xmath22 where the magnetic field is expressed by @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the electron neutrino .",
    "the neutral current interaction is symmetric in all flavours and does not contribute to the neutrino radiative transitions and were ignored in eq .",
    "expanding @xmath26 with eigen functions of including @xmath23 , and integrating them , we find the effective lagrangian @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the filling factor of landau levels , and @xmath29 is the anti - symmetric tensor , and @xmath30 @xmath24 is the superposition @xmath31 of three mass eigenstates @xmath32 and a mixing matrix @xmath33 .",
    "it follows that @xmath34 thus eq . leads a neutrino radiative transition , which has the following unusual properties : that is lorentz non - invariant ; the strength is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the coupling strength is a topological invariant which satisfies a low energy theorem and remains the same in systems of disorders at finite - temperature @xcite .",
    "a radiative transition @xmath36 takes place , since the neutrino mass difference is larger than the photon s effective mass determined by the plasma frequency @xmath37 . the event that @xmath38 is detected or interacts with others at @xmath10 and @xmath39 escapes ,",
    "is studied .",
    "the lsz formula @xcite is extended to an s - matrix , @xmath40 $ ] of satisfying this boundary condition @xcite at the finite - time interval . because @xmath41,h_0 ] \\neq 0 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] couples with the final states of continuous spectrum of the kinetic energy different from the initial kinetic energy , which is caused by the overlap of the waves .",
    "thus the space time symmetry of the free lagrangian such as the conservation law of the kinetic energy and manifest lorenz invariance are partly broken in @xmath9 .",
    "being non - invariant , @xmath9 can be much larger in magnitude than the invariant as in the example ; latexmath:[$    energy .",
    "@xmath13 is lorentz invariant and is proportional to @xmath43 , which is negligibly small for the neutrino @xcite , whereas @xmath9 is proportional to a lower power in @xmath44 of much larger magnitude .",
    "the amplitude is written as @xmath45 , for a neutrino prepared at a time @xmath46 , and a photon interacting at a space - time position @xmath47 and an unmeasured - neutrino , which are expressed in the form @xmath48 , and the time @xmath49 is integrated in the region @xmath50 .",
    "the size of photon wave function , @xmath51 , is estimated later .",
    "after the straightforward but tedious calculations , the details of which were given in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have the total probability in the form @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the length of decay region .",
    "the function @xmath56 , which is given in refs .",
    "@xcite , is characterized by a phase factor @xmath57 of the correlation function of the angular velocity @xmath58 , shows @xmath59 , and @xmath60 shows @xmath61 and is negligible now .",
    "the phase space for @xmath59 is different from that of @xmath61 , and is derived from the causality condition .",
    "it follows for the general cases of two neutrino flavour and an angle @xmath62 between the magnetic field and @xmath63 that @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a mixing angle between the flavour and mass eigenstates , and the heaver neutrino corresponds to the electron neutrino if @xmath66 . for the three neutrino cases",
    ", @xmath67 becomes a more complicated expression of an essentially the equivalent result .",
    "the state vector of revealing the constant probability , @xmath59 , in the vacuum , is a superposition of the parent and daughters of almost time independent weight , and is like a stationary state .",
    "in the environment of many atoms or molecules , on the other hand , the produced photon interacts with them and loses its energy easily .",
    "consequently , the probability of the neutrino to lose the energy is given by the product @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is governed by qed and is order unity .",
    "hence , the energy is transfered , and the environment gains the energy and is heated . it must be noted that the diffractive probability for the neutrino is determined by @xmath70 and is much smaller than that of the photon , in the situation @xmath71 of the paper , and is ignored .",
    "equations @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are applied to the solar corona .",
    "parameters are taken from ref . @xcite and the filling factor @xmath75 , and the wave packet size @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mean free path of the proton or electron are computed and used .",
    "the photon s effective mass @xmath78 becomes smaller than the neutrino mass squared difference .",
    "the function @xmath79 at the non - asymptotic region is used . using these values , we have @xmath80 the total energy transferred to the corona @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the energy flux of the neutrino . in fig . [",
    "fig : el ] , @xmath83 is given as a function of the radius @xmath84 , and compared with the estimated energy at @xmath85 @xcite , and the temperature .",
    "the mass differences are known but the absolute masses and mass hierarchy are unknown . for the inverted mass hierarchy , the neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath86 and for the normal mass hierarchy @xmath87 are substituted and the absolute mass are varied .",
    "the energy for ih is in accord with the observation , however the maximum value for nh is @xmath88 of the observation .",
    "the normal mass hierarchy would be rejected , even though there are ambiguities on the magnetic field , the electron density , and the temperature . because the electron density decreases steeply",
    ", the probability @xmath59 becomes the value eq .",
    "@xmath89 rapidly in the corona region , and the temperature rises steeply , which is in agreement with the observation .",
    "thus the heating of the quiet corona is understood from the neutrino radiative transitions .    in a corona hole ,",
    "the electron density is low and the magnetic field is high , and @xmath9 is not large at the height of the transition region .",
    "however the effect becomes stronger because the magnetic field is parallel to the neutrino up to a high altitude , and an acceleration of the solar wind becomes higher , which is in accord with the observation .",
    "a recent observation of a density modulation of the plasma wave @xcite also agrees with the extremely slow angular velocity @xmath90 s in this region .",
    "the probability @xmath59 varies following the change of @xmath17 , and influences the solar constant and other related phenomena .",
    "@xmath17 is large in the core of the sun spot , the rate of energy loss is correlated with the sun spot number .",
    "a correlation between the small variation of the solar constant of the order of eq .",
    "@xmath91 or slightly smaller value and the sun spot number observed in recent measurements appears .    in the active region where the present conditions hold , the diffractive probability is important as well .",
    "ionosphere in the earth is also a plasma of low density and weak magnetic field , so is affected by the electroweak hall effect .",
    "substituting values @xmath92 t and @xmath93 for the magnetic field and electron density , we have @xmath94 which is much smaller than the value at the solar corona eq .",
    "@xmath91 . the neutrino flux is lower by a factor @xmath95 due to the large distance , and the energy released from the neutrino to atoms becomes small . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature of lights from the sun is @xmath96 and is higher than that in the ionosphere @xmath97 k , which may be caused mainly by photochemical reactions .",
    "it may be hard to see the temperature variation caused by the neutrino in the ionosphere .",
    "nevertheless the diagonal component of the interaction lagrangian in the neutrino flavour , causes the neutrino current to induce the electric or magnetic fields .",
    "such time - dependent variation of the magnetic field around @xmath98 observed at the earth surface may be connected with the solar neutrino through the electroweak hall effects in the earth .",
    "these will be presented in a forthcoming work .",
    "the new coronal heating mechanism is based on the following : * ( 1 ) * massive neutrino , * ( 2 ) * electroweak hall effect of the dilute plasma in the magnetic field expressed by the effective interaction eq .",
    "( @xmath99 ) , and * ( 3 ) * the diffractive component of the transition probability @xmath59 .",
    "they lead the large coupling strength , @xmath100 , the tiny photon s effective mass @xmath101 , and the large wave packet @xmath102 , and make @xmath59 to be @xmath103 . due to @xmath59 , the neutrino which arrives the corona region maintaining the initial energy , decays and loses the energy .",
    "its probability @xmath104 agrees with @xmath59 , because @xmath105 .",
    "hence the average energy @xmath106 , which is in accord with the observation given in fig .",
    "[ fig : el ] , is transfered to the corona gas .",
    "@xmath59 was enhanced enormously in the corona region and the temperature rises steeply .",
    "the neutrinos gives the heat to the solar corona , and a possible electromagnetic effect to the earth through ionosphere .",
    "the probability @xmath107 for the neutrino is determined by the neutrino mass and @xmath108 , which are assumed @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and is much smaller than those of the photon .",
    "hence a reduction of the neutrino flux is negligible unless @xmath111 .",
    "the neutrino oscillation experiments measure the @xmath10-dependent variations of the neutrino flux derived from the components @xmath112 .",
    "the large @xmath59 in the dilute electron gas in the magnetic field is not in contradiction with existing neutrino phenomena and experiments .",
    "a correlation of the neutrino flux with the sun spot number may be too small to measure using the current ground detector .",
    "a new quantum phenomenon of the neutrinos radiative decays was derived and shown to give the heat source to the solar corona , and other effects in the earth ionosphere .",
    "thus the neutrino produced in the core gives the energy into the solar corona .",
    "the mechanism for the former is the nuclear fusion and that for the latter is the electroweak hall effect and the diffractive probability .",
