    "heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite and recently at lhc  @xcite have revealed that a state of matter is created which comprises of strongly interacting quarks and gluons commonly now known as sqgp  @xcite .",
    "no comprehensive theoretical model exists which can address all the complexities of the physics involved in these relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "different treatments and techniques are applied to various aspects of the collision process , each with its own set of assumptions and parameters to describe the system created by these collisions . from the final state of hadrons that emerge in these collisions",
    ", one can extract relevant information about different properties of the dense medium that is created .",
    "global observables , such as multiplicity distributions , describe the behavior of the system as a whole in contrast to local observables , such as high-@xmath6  jets .",
    "a successful model focused on one aspect of the problem may not say much about other aspects , but should at least not contradict what is observed .",
    "our study here is an initial attempt to understand the detailed nature of the global properties as manifested in local fluctuations .",
    "we use simulated events from a well - known event generator as a tool to develop our method of analysis so that at a later stage the same method can be applied to the real data .",
    "+    phase diagram of the strongly interacting matter is still not understood completely .",
    "widely acceptable school of thought , based on the lattice qcd calculations and the study of experimental data , believes that the qgp at low baryon chemical potential cools and forms hadrons in a continuous cross over manner and expects a first order phase transition for @xmath7 above a critical point .",
    "thus , among the various properties of the dense matter created in heavy - ion collisions that have been of interest to investigators is the nature of phase transition ( pt ) , both in the initial stage from hadrons to quarks and in the final stage from quarks back to hadrons @xcite and to locate the critical point .",
    "a fair amount of effort has been devoted to the former problem of formation in the beam energy scan ( bes ) program at low energies .",
    "less attention has been given to the latter problem of hadronization because of complications arising from various factors related to fluctuations in particle momenta and their multiplicity in each event .",
    "it is known in statistical physics that a fundamental characteristic of the critical behavior of a system undergoing pt is that it exhibits fluctuations of all scales .",
    "thus to find signals of quark - hadron pt and thus learn whether the system has underwent critical behavior , one should look for clustering of produced particles of various sizes .",
    "+    in dealing with the complications associated with fluctuations , scaling properties of factorial moments ( to be described late ) have been studied at the intermediate energies @xmath8 gev @xcite . however",
    ", insufficient number of particles are produced at those energies to allow bin sizes to be small unless particles produced at all transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) are included .",
    "such integration over all @xmath3 results in including particles produced at all times , thus smearing out signals of critical behavior and pt that occurs at different times of the evolution in different parts of the medium . at lhc",
    "the collision energy is high enough so that it is possible to have @xmath3 cuts and yet still have sufficient number of particles in a small @xmath3 bin to render feasible the study of scaling behavior over a wide range of bin sizes in @xmath9 .",
    "that is the main reason why we embark on this analysis of investigating the possibility of finding observable signals of quark - hadron pt and the quantitative measure of the critical behavior of the system , since extensive data on global multiplicities at lhc are now available .",
    "+    we develop here the method of analysis to be carried out . before applying it to the real data we simulate the event structure by use of an event generator ,",
    "the a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite .",
    "recently the ampt model has successfully reproduced many of the experimental data obtained from @xmath10 collisions at @xmath11 = 2.76 tev , such as the pseudorapidity and @xmath3 distributions  @xcite , harmonic flows  @xcite and reconstructed jet observables , including @xmath12-jet @xmath3 imbalance  @xcite .",
    "however , the model does not contain the dynamics of collective interaction , so it is not known whether the model can generate evidence for critical behavior .",
    "nevertheless , it is a good model for us to use in testing the effectiveness of our method of analysis in search for such evidences in the real data to be analyzed in the future .",
    "+    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the factorial moments , their scaling behaviors and the moments of the event - by - event fluctuations of the spatial patterns . in sec .",
    "iii the methodology for studying fluctuations in spatial patterns is discussed . a brief introduction to the ampt model and",
    "the simulated data is presented in sec .",
    "results of the analysis are discussed in sec .",
    "v followed by summary of the present work in sec .",
    "bialas and peschanski first proposed the use of factorial moments to study fluctuations because of their property that statistical fluctuations can be filtered out @xcite .",
    "the normalised factorial moment @xmath13 is defined as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the order of the moment and is an integer .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of particles in a bin of size @xmath17 in a @xmath18-dimensional space of observables and only @xmath19 are counted .",
    "the averages are weighted by the multiplicity distribution @xmath20 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if @xmath20 is poissonian , then @xmath21 for any @xmath22 .",
    "it is in that sense that the statistical fluctuations are filtered out .",
    "thus any increase of @xmath23 above 1 implies non - trivial dynamical fluctuations .",
    "a power - law behavior    @xmath24    over a range of small @xmath22 is referred to as _ intermittency _ , analogous to a similar behavior at the onset of turbulence in fluids for such a dependence .",
    "intermittency implies the lack of any particular spatial scale in the system and has been observed in many systems of collisions with positive intermittency index ( @xmath25 ) @xcite . in terms of the number of bins @xmath26 , thus eq .",
    "( [ inter1 ] ) may be written as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the intermittency index , a positive number .",
    "+    the possibility of finding a signal of quark - gluon plasma by means of intermittency was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the use of @xmath29 was then applied by hwa and nazirov @xcite to the quantification of the nature of fluctuations in a system undergoing second - order pt in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory  @xcite .",
    "it was found that to a high degree of accuracy @xmath13 satisfies the power - law behavior    @xmath30    referred to as f - scaling .",
    "of importance to note is that eq .",
    "( [ fq ] ) can be valid even if the scaling behavior in eq .",
    "( [ inter2 ] ) is not valid .",
    "it is derived in @xcite that @xmath31 the scaling exponent @xmath32 is essentially independent of the details of the gl parameters .",
    "this behavior has been experimentally verified for optical systems at the threshold of lasing @xcite . theoretically , simulation of quark - hadron pt in the 2d ising model done in @xcite results in scaling behavior of @xmath13 that is in agreement with the eqs .",
    "( [ fq ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "+      vertically averaged horizontal moments can gauge the spatial fluctuations , neglecting the event space fluctuations whereas horizontally averaged vertical moments lose information about spatial fluctuations and only measure the fluctuations from event - to - event .",
    "however to fully account for all the fluctuations that a system formed in the heavy ion collisions exhibits , hwa and cao @xcite introduced _ moments of factorial moment distributions _ which takes into account the spatial fluctuations as well as the event space fluctuations .",
    "hwa and cao have suggested the study of event factorial moments of the spatial patterns , to gauge the degree of event - by - event fluctuations , instead of the sample factorial moments .",
    "the analysis is referred to as the _ erraticity analysis _ and the measure of fluctuations of the spatial patterns so determined quantifies this in terms of an index named as _",
    "erraticity index _",

    "if @xmath61 is found to have a linear dependence on @xmath57 , then _ erraticity index _",
    "@xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 in the linear region so that it is independent of both @xmath37 and @xmath57 . thus @xmath62 is a number that characterizes the fluctuations of spatial patterns .",

    "these are just model values , but suggestive of the significance of erraticity index to characterize dynamical processes .",
    "as an effective measure of the fluctuations in the spatial patterns , we find what are known as horizontal factorial moments or the event factorial moments of the multiplicity distributions .",
    "we have studied charged particles generated in the five @xmath3 windows with @xmath65 = 0.1 gev / c for @xmath68 gev / c so as to avoid smearing of recognizable features , due to superposition of different patterns at different @xmath65 intervals .",

    "thus the cumulative variable @xmath72 and @xmath73 are used  @xcite which are defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is @xmath71 or @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 denote respectively the minimum and maximum values of @xmath75 interval considered , and @xmath79 is the single particle @xmath71 or @xmath76 density .",
