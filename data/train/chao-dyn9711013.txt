    "periodic  orbit theory aims at the semiclassical evaluation of energy levels of quantum systems and relates their spectral properties to periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system . for autonomous systems one considers the trace of the green s function @xmath0 which determines also the density of states @xmath1 . for periodically driven systems the object of interest are the traces @xmath2 of the stroboscopic time ",
    "evolution operator over @xmath3 periods ; they encode the so  called quasienergies of states that are stationary in the stroboscopic description .",
    "both types of traces can be written as a sum of _ individual _ contributions of periodic orbits for chaotic ( hyperbolic ) systems @xcite or a sum over rational tori for integrable motion @xcite .",
    "recent semiclassical studies @xcite based on periodic  orbit theory were devoted to the neighbourhood , in the space of control parameters , of classical bifurcations .",
    "these are instances in which periodic orbits coalesce and are the mechanism how orbits are born or disappear , or change their configuration when the energy or an external parameter is varied .",
    "bifurcations are ubiquitous in systems with a mixed phase space and pave the path from integrable to chaotic motion .",
    "a _ collective _ treatment of the bifurcating orbits was found necessary , and even more the inclusion of predecessors of such orbits which live in complexified phase space and were termed _ ghosts_. a collective contribution comes from an orbit cluster and can only far away from the bifurcation be written as a sum of individual contributions .",
    "both types of contributions are an additive term in the periodic  orbit expansion of the trace in question .",
    "the existing semiclassical ( and most of the classical ) studies focus on the generic bifurcations in the classification of meyer and bruno @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these are the bifurcations that are typically encountered when one has only a single parameter at hand to steer the system through parameter space , or , equivalently , when one investigates the periodic  orbit families in a given autonomous system as a function of energy .",
    "in general one assigns a codimension to each type of bifurcation by counting the number of parameters to be controlled in order to encounter it in a general setting .",
    "( the class of bifurcations of a given codimension is enlarged when symmetries are imposed on the system @xcite . )",
    "the generic bifurcations are accordingly the bifurcations of codimension one . in each of these bifurcations",
    "there is a central orbit of period @xmath3 , surrounded by one or two satellite orbits of period @xmath4 .",
    "the cases @xmath5 are the tangent , period  doubling , period  tripling , and period  quadrupling bifurcations , respectively .",
    "there are two types of period  quadrupling bifurcations ( island chain and touch  and  go ) , but only one for all other @xmath6 .",
    "all period@xmath6 bifurcations with @xmath7 follow the island chain pattern .    in @xcite _",
    "approximations for the collective contributions were derived that are only valid close to the ( generic ) bifurcation ; far away from the bifurcation they give rise to individual contributions with the wrong amplitudes .",
    "@xcite give _ uniform _ approximations that are valid even far away from the bifurcation , where they asymptotically split into individual contributions with the correct amplitudes .",
    "the present work is devoted to bifurcations of codimension two in autonomous hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom or time  periodic hamiltonian systems with one degree of freedom .",
    "the bifurcations are classified and their impact on semiclassical periodic ",
    "orbit theory is studied in detail .",
    "we derive uniform approximations of collective contributions to the semiclassical traces and discuss certain global bifurcations in conjunction with so - called stokes transition .",
    "bifurcations of codimension two manifest themselves in one  parameter studies in certain sequences of generic bifurcations .",
    "sadovski , shaw , and delos @xcite found that such sequences can be explained by normal ",
    "form theory @xcite , but did not attempt a classification with respect to the codimension .",
    "the classical part of the present study is very much inspired by these works .",
    "it was indeed demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that bifurcations of codimension two are frequently felt semiclassically and necessitate a collective treatment even when one steers the system through control space with less than two parameters .",
    "this implies that collective contributions of this kind will constitute a basic ingredient in a semiclassical trace formula for systems with a mixed phase space .",
    "they indeed played an essential rle in the semiclassical determination of the quasienergies of the kicked top @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : nform ] we derive normal forms for the hamiltonian that describe the bifurcations of codimension two .",
    "we find that they are organized by the multiplicity @xmath6 in analogy to the situation for codimension one .",
    "the corresponding sequences of codimension one bifurcations involve a tangent bifurcation of period @xmath4 , followed by a period@xmath6 bifurcation that involves another orbit of period @xmath3 .",
    "( the representative case studied in @xcite corresponds to @xmath8 . )",
    "the normal forms and the sequences of codimension one bifurcations in the neighbourhood of the codimension two point in control space ( technically spoken , the _ unfolding _ of the normal forms ) are discussed and illustrated in section [ sec : discn ] .    with section [ sec : deriv ]",
    "we turn to aspects within semiclassical periodic ",
    "orbit theory and present the starting point for the derivation of collective contributions of bifurcating orbits , consisting of two  dimensional integrals over phase space or poincar surfaces of section that involve the generating function @xmath9 of the classical stroboscopic map .",
    "uniform approximations of these contributions are derived in section [ sec : unif ] .",
    "they involve a phase function @xmath10 and an amplitude function @xmath11 .",
    "normal forms of these are obtained from the corresponding hamiltonians by non  canonical transformations and partial integrations .",
    "investigating the influence from higher  order terms in the phase equips us with a sufficient number of coefficients to guarantee the right stationary ",
    "phase limit of the expressions , which are therefore truly uniform .",
    "[ the cases @xmath12 lead to standard diffraction integrals connected to the cusp and butterfly catastrophes , respectively . among the large number of applications , the transitional approximations have been investigated in connection to bifurcations of closed orbits in @xcite .",
    "uniform approximations have not been derived there , however , and the canonical invariant determination of coefficients as well as stokes transitions are also not discussed . ]    in section [ sec : stokes ] we discuss certain global bifurcations that become important in the ensuing diffraction catastrophe integrals .",
    "they give rise to _ stokes transitions _ in which the contribution of a ghost satellite is switched on or off .",
    "the ghosts and transitions arise when the integrals are analyzed using the method of steepest descent .",
    "stokes transitions have been investigated in the context of diffraction integrals and asymptotic expansions before .",
    "a uniform approximation for an isolated transition is given in @xcite and has been applied for perturbed cat maps in @xcite , which is the only treatment of this phenomenon in semiclassics that we know of .",
    "the stokes transitions investigated there , however , occur far away from any other bifurcation and can be regarded as isolated .",
    "a transition requires special treatment when it occurs in the immediate neighbourhood of a usual ` local ' bifurcation , a situation that is often encountered in mixed systems .",
    "the uniform approximations and normal forms derived here can also be employed to describe the stokes transition of a period@xmath4 ghost prior to a tangent bifurcation when the so  called ` dominant ' orbit involved is real and of period @xmath3 . the complete sequence of local and global bifurcations that we can handle consists of the period@xmath6 bifurcation at the central orbit and tangent bifurcations of satellites , followed by stokes transitions in which ghost satellites once more interact with the central orbit .",
    "we conclude and point out open questions in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the local bifurcations to be discussed are instances in which periodic orbits coalesce as parameters are varied .",
    "the types of bifurcations generically encountered in a given class of systems depends on the number of parameters varied , and the number of parameters typically needed to be controlled in order to find a particular type is called its codimension .",
    "here we investigate bifurcations of codimension two in the class of periodically time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian systems with one degree of freedom .",
    "in other words , we study families of hamiltonians @xmath13 that depend on the two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 and obey @xmath16 , where the period is set to unity for convenience . in general these systems have no time ",
    "reversal nor any geometric symmetry .",
    "the discussion directly carries over to autonomous systems with two degrees of freedom since these can be reduced to one  parameter families of periodic systems with one degree of freedom by a standard procedure described e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the periodic orbits show up as fixed points in iterations of the so  called stroboscopic map @xmath17 which is induced by the evolution over one period .",
    "this map is area preserving .",
    "its linearized version @xmath18 ( corresponding to a @xmath19 matrix ) hence obeys @xmath20 .",
    "orbits that appear for the first time in the @xmath21th iteration are said to be of primitive period @xmath21 .",
    "such an orbit gives rise to @xmath21 fixed points in each @xmath3step map with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an integer counting repetitions .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath24 of the linearized @xmath21step map @xmath25 are reciprocal to each other .",
    "a stable orbit has unimodular eigenvalues and hence @xmath26 with the real stability angle @xmath27 .",
    "an orbit is instable if the eigenvalues are real .",
    "there are two cases depending on the sign of the eigenvalues , @xmath28 , with the real and by convention positive instability exponent @xmath29 .",
    "in general , an orbit bifurcates whenever the linearized @xmath3step map @xmath30 ( with again @xmath22 ) acts at the locus of the orbit in phase space in at least one direction as the identity map and hence obeys @xmath31 or , equivalently , @xmath32 where the integers @xmath33 , @xmath6 are taken as relatively prime .",
    "this bifurcation condition implies a discrete @xmath6fold rotational symmetry @xmath34 in the flow pattern around the bifurcating orbit . for @xmath35",
    "the orbit in question is a ` central ' orbit on which ` satellite ' orbits of primitive period @xmath36 contract at the bifurcation . for @xmath37",
    "there are two possibilities , the orbit is either involved as a satellite in a bifurcation with an orbit of smaller primitive period , or it takes part in an isochronous bifurcation with other orbits of same period .",
    "turning these observations around , there is always a central periodic orbit of smallest primitive period @xmath21 among the bifurcating orbits which coalesces with satellites of period @xmath38 .",
    "for that reason @xmath6 is called the multiplicity .",
    "the bifurcations of codimension one have been classified by meyer and bruno @xcite ( see the introductory section ) .",
    "they constitute the building blocks of the scenarios of higher codimension and will be illustrated together with those of codimension two in the next section .",
    "recall that for each @xmath6 there is exactly one type with the exception of @xmath39 which allows for two variants .",
    "the bifurcation condition ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) is reflected by the hamiltonian flow around the central orbit ; accordingly , the bifurcations can be investigated by studying the general form of the hamiltonian in the vicinity of this orbit . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we aim at the reduction of the general expressions to certain simple normal forms by suitable canonical transformations . in that way one can identify the parameters that govern the distance to the bifurcation .",
    "they can be chosen such that @xmath40 brings us on a codimension one bifurcation and the codimension two scenario is encountered if in addition @xmath41 . for codimension one",
    "the construction ( that is carried out for that case in detail in @xcite and is recapitulated below ) leads to the birkhoff normal forms @xmath42}b_li^l + c i^{m/2}\\cos",

    "these expressions are autonomous and display the @xmath6fold symmetry even globally .",
    "the periodic orbits are mapped to fixed points @xmath48 , @xmath49 and are thus determined as roots of polynomials in @xmath50 and @xmath51 . from vieta s relations between these roots ( or locations of satellites ) and the coefficients of the polynomials",
    "it follows that orbits collapse on the center as the lowest  order terms @xmath52 ( and @xmath53 for codimension two ) of the fixed  point equations are steered to zero .    to describe the codimension two variants we have to include higher  order terms to account for additional satellites that approach the center and obtain the extended normal forms @xmath54}b_l i^l + c i^{m/2}\\cos m\\phi   \\\\ \\hline \\end{array } \\;.\\ ] ] the normal forms for @xmath7 are the usual birkhoff normal forms ;",
    "they will , however , be investigated not only for small @xmath14 but also for small @xmath15 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath55 go exactly one order beyond the birkhoff normal forms .      in the derivation of the normal forms ( [ eq : hnform ] ) and ( [ eq : hnform ] ) the central orbit is placed into the origin of a local coordinate system @xmath56 by a time  dependent canonical transformation .",
    "this is done in such a way that a taylor expansion in @xmath51 and @xmath50 yields @xmath57 with time  independent @xmath27 and @xmath58 .",
    "the remainder in the expansion indicates third and higher orders in @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "the new hamiltonian will be @xmath21periodic but otherwise as general as the one we started with .",
    "hence it suffices to study the case @xmath59 .",
    "one passes to a rotating coordinate system , where the angular frequency @xmath60 is adopted to the motion around the center at the bifurcation , and examines the expansion of the hamiltonian in a taylor series in @xmath51 and @xmath50 as well as a fourier series in @xmath61 .",
    "most terms in the expansion can be removed by canonical transformations ( specified below ) up to a certain order in @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the deviations of the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 that govern the distance to the bifurcation .",
    "the expansion is carried out up to a certain degree , requiring that no bifurcating orbits are added or qualitatively affected by the omitted higher  order terms .",
    "the linearized map @xmath62 has degenerate eigenvalues @xmath63 for @xmath37 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "this entails that the corresponding bifurcation scenarios of codimension one and two are essentially one  dimensional .",
    "the reason is that the linearized map is in these cases generically not diagonalizable : otherwise one would have located the matrix @xmath66 in the three  dimensional manifold @xmath67 of real @xmath19 matrices with @xmath68 @xcite . with only two parameters at one s disposal , however , one generically finds only such matrices with @xmath69 for which the eigenspace is one  dimensional .",
    "the linearized map describes then a shear transformation and acts as the identity in only one direction .",
    "the reasoning can be put onto another footing by resolving the apparent paradox that we can cast the second  order terms into a diagonal form @xmath70 in the immediate neighbourhood of the bifurcation , which involves only two parameters .",
    "this diagonalization , however , depends in a singular way on the parameters of the original expansion @xmath71 .",
    "( note that all three terms are @xmath72 and @xmath73invariant . ) accordingly , three coefficients @xmath74 are to be controlled in order to let the second order vanish . such an argumentation will be used again for @xmath39 .",
    "we choose the @xmath51axis as the line on which orbits approach each other at the bifurcation and invoke the splitting lemma of catastrophe theory in order to simplify the expression in @xmath50direction . with a suitable scaling transformation",
    "one can achieve @xmath75 .",
    "the normal form for @xmath65 is symmetric in @xmath51 since in that case the coordinate system rotates by @xmath76 in each period .",
    "for @xmath77 the central orbit is stable close to the bifurcation so that we can achieve @xmath78 in ( [ eq : hstart ] ) , entailing @xmath79 .",
    "it is then convenient to use canonical polar coordinates ( [ eq : canonpolarcoor ] ) . in the rotating",
    "coordinate system the leading  order term in @xmath44 takes the form @xmath80 with @xmath81 in agreement with the bifurcation condition ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) .",
    "the expansion reads in detail @xmath82 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 runs from @xmath84 since only such terms arise from expressions of type @xmath85 .",
    "let us assume that all @xmath61 and @xmath45 dependence is already eliminated up to a certain order @xmath86 .",
    "the majority of terms of this order are then removed by a canonical transformation to new coordinates @xmath87 that is generated according to @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 by the function @xmath91\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 after the transformation we switch back in our notation from @xmath87 to @xmath93 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath94 diverges at the bifurcation if the resonance condition @xmath95 is met .",
    "this affects , for instance , all @xmath61 and @xmath45independent terms ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath45dependent terms are of type @xmath97 . here",
    "@xmath98 is an integer since @xmath33 and @xmath6 are relatively prime , and @xmath99 as before . in the orders that appear in the normal forms the latter restriction admits only @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath45dependent term of lowest order in @xmath44 is generically of type @xmath101 .",
    "a shift of @xmath45 eliminates the constant in the cosine . if the coefficient of this term is not small then one can get rid of constants @xmath102 in higher orders @xmath103 by a transformation of the form @xmath104 with suitably chosen coefficients .",
    "additional considerations are needed for @xmath39 .",
    "the most general expression that goes one order beyond the birkhoff normal form reads @xmath105 the codimension two bifurcation is approached for vanishing @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( or @xmath106 ) , while the other second  order coefficient @xmath106 ( or @xmath15 ) is finite .",
    "both cases are equivalent and mapped onto each other by a rotation about @xmath107 .",
    "the normal form @xmath108 has been written down for small @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath106 is finite we can eliminate two of the three third  order terms in ( [ eq : h4tilde ] ) by a canonical transformation and achieve @xmath109 .",
    "[ the corresponding generating function is of the simple form @xmath110 if corrections involving @xmath14 and @xmath15 are neglected ; the complete form is slightly more complicated . ]",
    "the fine  print in the derivation for @xmath39 is that two orbits pretend to bifurcate also as we send @xmath111 .",
    "we identify now these orbits and show that for codimension two they are actually ghosts ( complex solutions of the fixed  point equations ) at a finite distance to the center . for simplicity we set @xmath112 ; this does not affect the general line of reasoning .",
    "the satellites that concern us solve the fixed  point equation @xmath113\\sin 4\\phi=0\\ ] ] by @xmath114 .",
    "the other fixed  point equation yields @xmath115 ( these satellites are related by the reflection symmetry @xmath116 and undergo a pitchfork bifurcation as @xmath117 . the symmetry is broken if @xmath118 . ) for reasons similar to those put forward for @xmath12 , _ two _ parameters have to be controlled in order achieve @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 : for the given parameter combination there is no @xmath45 dependence in the second order of @xmath44 .",
    "but actually there are two independent terms involving @xmath45 , namely @xmath121 and @xmath122  one of them had been eliminated by a diagonalization that is again sensible only if the other has a non  vanishing coefficient .",
    "we already used two parameters , then , such that we must assume @xmath14 and @xmath123 to be finite .",
    "this gives @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and the cartesian coordinates ( [ eq : canonpolarcoor ] ) indeed remain finite : as announced this shows that the orbits that appeared to bifurcate are complex solutions ( with real @xmath50 and imaginary @xmath51 ) of the fixed  point equations and stay away from the center .",
    "we discuss now in detail the bifurcations of codimension two that are described by the normal forms given in the preceding section . in each case the location of the periodic points , given as the solutions of the fixed  point equations @xmath126 are investigated as the parameters are varied .",

    "two orbits of the same primitive period coalesce . on one side of the bifurcation",

    "the scenario is described by the normal form @xmath128 which accounts for two periodic orbits @xmath129 at coordinates @xmath130 and @xmath131 often one encounters a third orbit of identical period in close neighbourhood ( in phase space ) to the bifurcating orbits .",

    "the reasoning is facilitated by the observation that the problem can be reduced in all cases to one dimension by considering the @xmath44lines ( or , to be precise , the complex @xmath44planes ) @xmath353 that connect the central orbit and the ghost satellites radially .    for @xmath37 and @xmath8",
    "the situation is simple since there are no other orbits than the two satellites ( which are the ghosts in question ) and the central orbit .",
    "the diffraction integral for @xmath37 involves pearcey s integral ( and its derivatives ) for which the stokes transitions have been studied by wright @xcite . in the construction of @xmath287 the real solution has been placed in the origin , @xmath354 .",
    "the satellites have coordinates @xmath130 , @xmath355 ( a tangent bifurcation is now encountered at @xmath356 .",
    "two orbits coalesce also at @xmath40 , but both remain real there due to the construction . ) the orbit at the origin has the action @xmath264 , while @xmath357 for the satellites .",
    "the stokes transition takes place at @xmath358 figure [ fig : pver11cont ] displays the integration contour in the complex @xmath286plane for @xmath359 , @xmath360 together with the equipotential lines of @xmath361|$ ] ( or , equivalently , of @xmath362 ) .",
    "the plot demonstrates the well  known existence of the connection and is characteristic even for arbitrary sets of parameters that fulfill ( [ eq : m1stokes ] ) since the shape of the contour is fully determined by the combination @xmath363 : the contour expands linearly with a scaling of @xmath51 , such that we can achieve , for instance , @xmath120 , and does not change if @xmath287 is multiplied by a real constant , which allows to set @xmath364 .    for even @xmath6 the problem",
    "is mapped on the case @xmath65 .",
    "we already determined the locations ( [ eq : m2pos ] ) of the orbits for the hamiltonian normal form @xmath142 . by convention ,",
    "coefficients changed sign in the definition of @xmath365 , but the coordinates are not affected by this .",
    "the satellites have the actions @xmath366 from the condition @xmath367 one finds a stokes transition of complex ghosts for @xmath41 if @xmath368 .",
    "( no transition is encountered at @xmath369 or for @xmath41 , but @xmath370 , since the radicand is positive then ) . as for @xmath371",
    "there is only one scale ",
    "invariant parameter combination @xmath363 , but for each value there are now two variants of the contour depending on @xmath372 .",
    "the stokes transition at @xmath41 involves a ghost with a nonvanishing imaginary part of the action .",
    "figure [ fig : pver21cont ] shows how the integration contour changes in the complex @xmath286plane due to the tangent bifurcation and the stokes transition .",
    "the plots proof the existence of a path that connects both sheets at constant @xmath373 .",
    "different situations with @xmath367 appear , however , for @xmath374 .",
    "no stokes transition happens there because the satellite involved is real for @xmath145 and a ghost with real action and real @xmath346 for @xmath375 .",
    "figure [ fig : p2cnt2 ] confirms that indeed the contours are separated by another ` real ghost ' ( dashed contour ) .",
    "for @xmath184 the phase function on the @xmath50axis is a polynomial of degree five .",
    "it appears on first sight that the three satellites could be arranged in such a way that the sheet of the ghost @xmath348 is separated from the sheet of the central orbit @xmath350 by the remaining real satellite @xmath63 .",
    "one easily finds , however , that the sheets are separated for the particular phase function only if the real parts of the three roots @xmath376 , @xmath377 of equation ( [ eq : m5fp ] ) all have the same sign , which in turn can be ruled out by a careful inspection of equation ( [ eq : m5fp ] ) : from vieta s relations it follows that otherwise the coefficient of the linear term @xmath378 $ ] would not vanish .",
    "note that the order @xmath379 in @xmath380 indeed results in a nonvanishing coefficient but is considered , as usually , only as a perturbation and does not alter the situation qualitatively .",
    "the existence of a steepest  descent connection of the ghost and the central orbit at the stokes transition is then guaranteed also for @xmath184 .",
    "the transition takes place at the value of @xmath381 that is the solution of @xmath382 close to @xmath383 . to derive this equation",
    "we first reduce the expression for @xmath384 with help of the fixed  point equation @xmath385 for the scaled variable @xmath386 to the form @xmath387=0 $ ] . introducing @xmath388 here and in the fixed  point equation and splitting the latter into real and imaginary part , one can solve then for @xmath389 and @xmath390 and obtains the cubic equation @xmath391 .",
    "its roots give three values for @xmath61 which all solve ( [ eq : teq ] ) .",
    "only one of the roots , however , fulfills @xmath392 ; this is the one that corresponds to the approximate value of @xmath61 given above .    for odd @xmath193",
    "there are four different satellites on each line .",
    "they are generically grouped in pairs that lie on opposite sides of the center , and the situation is similar to @xmath65 with slightly broken reflection symmetry .",
    "indeed it follows from the derivation of the normal forms that the odd terms originating from higher  order perturbations are neglegible for small @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; the results for @xmath65 are then directly applicable to the present case .",
    "we studied bifurcations of codimension two in hamiltonian systems that are either autonomous and have two degrees of freedom or periodic with one degree of freedom .",
    "the normal forms derived in section [ sec : nform ] and discussed in section [ sec : discn ] show that the typical sequences of codimension one bifurcations in the neighbourhood ( in parameter space ) of the bifurcation of codimension two consists of a period@xmath6 bifurcation at a central orbit followed by a tangent bifurcation in which satellites become ghosts .",
    "additional generic scenarios are encountered in the presence of symmetries @xcite .",
    "isochronous pitchfork bifurcations are the most important addition of codimension one in the case of time  reversal or reflection symmetries ; they will also show up in the neighbourhood of codimension two bifurcations in these systems .",
    "only a small number of the bifurcations of codimension one and two correspond to ( special cases of ) a so  called elementary catastrophe due to thom ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these appear in many different contexts and describe , for instance , bifurcations of codimension up to four in maps that are not restricted by area preservation .",
    "we use the usual names and symbols and further denote each hamiltonian bifurcation type by @xmath393 , where @xmath6 is the multiplicity and @xmath394 the codimension .",
    "the fold @xmath395 corresponds to the tangent bifurcation @xmath396 .",
    "the cusp @xmath397 is @xmath398 , and @xmath399 is a cusp with a reflection symmetry .",
    "@xmath400 is a butterfly @xmath401 with reflection symmetry .",
    "the period  tripling bifurcation @xmath402 corresponds to a version of the elliptic umbilic @xmath403 .",
    "all other normal forms describe catastrophes that would be of much higher codimension without area preservation . especially for the cases @xmath77",
    "one has to rely on higher  order perturbation theory .",
    "it implies that i ) for a given codimension the class of bifurcations in hamiltonian systems is considerably larger and ii ) although this can be circumvented by considering a normal form of much higher codimension from ordinary catastrophe theory , these normal forms have then again to be restricted : points that correspond to the trajectory of one and the same orbit lie on the same height ( energy or action ) .",
    "the classical perturbation theory takes care of this and in addition gives the right codimension .",
    "collective contributions to semiclassical traces were derived that involve normal forms for a phase function @xmath10 and an amplitude function @xmath11 .",
    "the expressions involve just as many coefficients as are determined by the actions and stability properties of the bifurcating orbits , including a suppression of certain unwanted ghosts for @xmath404 .",
    "the expressions constitute uniform approximations : they are also valid far away from the bifurcation and asymptotically take the form of a sum of isolated contributions ( [ eq : statphaseint ] ) .",
    "the uniform approximations display stokes transitions in which the ghost satellites interact once more with the central orbit and leave the steepest  descent integration contour .",
    "the validity of the approximations given here is limited if additional orbits become important or ` unwanted ' ghosts become real ; bifurcations of even higher codimension are then to be studied .",
    "the basic steps would be the same as in the present study : derivation of hamiltonian normal forms that account for all bifurcating orbits ; reduction of normal forms to get rid of non  bifurcating orbits and to account for independent stabilities and actions .",
    "an important open question is concerned with the complexity of periodic ",
    "orbit clusters typically encountered in the quest of resolving spectra when one approaches the semiclassical limit : this requires knowledge of the dynamics up to the heisenberg time @xmath405 and involves a competition of increasing resolution in phase space and proliferation of periodic orbits .    one might also be concerned about cascades , which are sequences of bifurcations of a certain orbit of period @xmath3 at differing values of @xmath406 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : bifcond ] ) .",
    "the most prominent example is the basic building block of period  doubling cascades : an orbit of period @xmath407 is born at an orbit of period @xmath3 in a period  doubling bifurcation ( @xmath408 ) and period  doubles itself at @xmath409 . a huge variety of cascades exists , however , since bifurcations happen whenever the stability angle @xmath27 is a rational multiple of @xmath225 .",
    "bifurcations in a cascade can not be encountered simultaneously in parameter space , since this would imply a singular change in the linearized map .",
    "for that reason cascades can not be regarded as unfoldings of bifurcations of higher codimension .",
    "the bifurcations in an unfolding show up simultaneously in a given iteration of the map ; the cascades involve bifurcations that appear in distinct iterations .",
    "one could study , for instance , those cascades that arise from the iteration of the map generated by a normal form , and ask the question whether situations exist in which the orbits in the cascade must be treated collectively ; it would be indeed nice to see that one can do without .",
    "an argument in favor of this expectation has been given in @xcite .",
