    "it has long been appreciated that outflows from galaxies can have a major effect on galaxy formation and evolution , influencing such basic galactic properties such as the mean metal abundance @xcite or even the survival of low mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "more recent discoveries have reinvigorated interest in the role of galactic outflows , e.g. : the presence of metals in the true inter - galactic medium at low and high redshifts @xcite ; that a sizable fraction of all metals ever created now reside outside galaxies @xcite ; and direct observational evidence for ubiquitous outflows from , and 100 kpc - scale cavities around , the lyman break galaxies @xcite .    by the far the best - studied , best - understood , and arguably most common form of galactic outflow capable of polluting the igm are superwinds @xcite .",
    "these are loosely - collimated multi - phase outflows from actively - star forming galaxies , i.e.  starburst galaxies . within the local universe starbursts",
    "account for @xmath1% of all massive star formation ( and hence metal production ) , and starburst activity becomes progressively more important at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "as all local starburst galaxies appear to have superwinds @xcite , it is clear that starburst - driven winds are of major importance .    over the last 5 years new observations of superwinds , in particular satellite - based observations in the euv and soft and hard x - ray bands ,",
    "have substantially added to our understanding of the physics behind superwinds .",
    "i will discuss how these new observations support the long - standing conceptual picture of how superwinds work , specifically ( a ) how superwinds are driven by the collective mechanical power of multiple supernovae ( sne ) occurring within the disks ( in particular the nuclei ) of starburst galaxies , and ( b ) x - ray emission from superwinds . where appropriate i will contrast superwinds with agn winds ( i.e.  loosely collimated outflows , and not large - scale jets ) .",
    "the basic conceptual picture of how starburst - driven winds work was established nearly two decades ago . in the (",
    "* henceforth cc ) model , the very high rate per unit volume of core collapse sne in starburst regions leads to young snrs colliding before they have time to lose energy radiatively .",
    "shocks in these collisions thermalize the kinetic energy of the ejecta , creating a very hot ( @xmath2 k ) , high pressure ( @xmath3 k @xmath4 ) and low density gas that fills the volume of the starburst region . in the analytical cc model",
    "the multiple individual sn events are treated as a time - averaged , spatially - uniform injection of mass and energy .",
    "the merged sn - ejecta expands adiabatically , becoming supersonic at the edge of the starburst region and rapidly reaching terminal velocity of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "numerical simulations show that this wind expands preferentially along the minor axis of any disk - like galaxy forming a bipolar flow , sweeping up cooler , denser , ambient disk or halo gas , and stripping ambient gas from the walls of the cavity ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ram pressure of the merged sn - ejecta accelerates this entrained gas to velocities of a few @xmath7 to 1000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the multiple cool , warm and hot gas phases observed in superwinds ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are all entrained ambient gas .",
    "is this simple scenario realistic , given what we have learned about starbursts in the last 20 years ? before the _ chandra _ observations of @xcite there had been no believable detection of the very hot gas predicted by the cc model in any starburst region ( the very hot gas that in theory drives superwinds ) , so why was this model accepted in the first place ?",
    "in fact , convincing observational evidence for the sn - driven nature of superwinds , and the quantitative accuracy of the cc model , appeared soon after its publication .",
    "modern observations continue to validate its most basic concepts .",
    "the classic starburst m82 is a particularly convenient laboratory for investigating starbursts and superwinds , given that it is one of the closest powerful starburst galaxies ( d=3.6 mpc ) , and that all current sf occurs within a 400 pc radius of the nucleus .",
    "its fir luminosity , dominated by the starburst activity , indicates a sn rate of @xmath8 per year . in terms of sf rate per unit area",
    "m82 lies close to the upper limit found in starbursts at both low and high redshift @xcite .",
    "radio observations show @xmath9 compact , but spatially resolved , snr remnants @xcite , that outline the starburst region as seen at other wavelengths .",
    "these are not the same sne that drive the wind , but are a subset of the sn population that occur in dense gaseous environments , although the total fraction of the starburst region filled with such dense gas must be @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "optical , near and mid - ir observations show large numbers of massive star clusters ( @xmath11 ) within the starburst region @xcite .",
    "note that the fraction of massive stars ( and hence eventual sne ) within such massive clusters is only @xmath12% of the total , consistent with the value observed in many starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , to first order , energy and mass injection from sne is distributed over the volume of the entire starburst region , in accord with the cc model .",
    "@xcite , and later @xcite and @xcite , used optical spectroscopy to map the pressure in warm ionized gas in central regions of m82 and other starburst galaxies with superwinds . essentially this uses the low filling factor h@xmath13-emitting gas clouds as tracers of the much hotter gas they are embedded in . at large radii",
    "the pressure drops rapidly with distance , as expected for a free radial wind . within a certain radius @xmath14",
    "the pressure is approximately constant , indicating that energy and mass injection is distributed within this region .",
    "the radial shape and normalization of these pressure profiles are consistent with the cc model .",
    "@xcite demonstrated for many galaxies with superwinds that @xmath14 is the same as the size of starburst @xmath15 .",
    "note that if agn drove these winds @xmath14 would not equal @xmath15 , even in models where energy injection is distributed over large regions due to diverted or halted jets @xcite . a thermal agn wind driven from the vicinity of the accretion disk ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would further differ from a starburst - driven wind , even if having initially similar total mass and energy injection rates .",
    "the cc model assumes radiative losses from the thermalized gas are negligible , which is true if energy and mass injection occurs over a volume similar to the size of an entire starburst region . @xcite",
    "have pointed out that if the injection region is much smaller than this , the increased density of the thermalized gas leads to significant radiative losses .",
    "their model is essentially of flows from very massive ( @xmath16 ) super star clusters , but i wish to point out that it would also apply to centrally - driven agn winds",
    ". strong radiative losses in agn winds would thus alter the physical properties observed on the larger galactic scales from those in starburst - driven superwinds .",
    "recent x - ray observations of superwinds have validated the use of warm gas as a tracer of the hot merged sn - ejecta , as well as detecting the very hot plasma predicted by the cc model .",
    "it is only with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory s arcsecond spatial resolution that emission from the multiple x - ray binaries formed in the starburst can be cleanly separated from the diffuse x - ray emission associated with the superwind ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dks_fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is especially true in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath17 to 8 kev ) where _ faint _ diffuse bremsstrahlung and line emission from @xmath18 k gas would be expected to be seen .",
    "@xcite were the first to robustly detect diffuse hard x - ray emission in a starburst region , once again in the archetype m82 .",
    "the spatial extent of this emission in the plane of the galaxy exactly matches that of the @xmath19-diameter starburst region , and matches the base of the superwind as seen at other wavelengths .",
    "more recent , higher spectral - resolution , _ chandra _ observations ( strickland et .",
    "al , in preparation ) show that the diffuse hard x - ray emission not purely thermal , but do confirm the presence of a @xmath20 kev fe k - shell emission that must come from a @xmath21 k plasma",
    ". in general such diffuse hard emission has not been detected in other nearby starbursts , even with _",
    ", as other starburst nuclei are more distant , and have smaller angular scales , than that in m82 .",
    "@xcite detected diffuse hard x - ray emission within the central @xmath22 of the nuclear starburst ngc 253 , but argue that the properties of this emission are more consistent with gas photoionized by that galaxy s llagn .",
    "diffuse soft x - ray emission in superwinds is considerably easier to observe than diffuse hard x - ray emission , by virtue of being orders of magnitude more luminous and spatially extended . nevertheless _",
    "chandra _ has also revolutionized our understanding of the origin and properties of soft diffuse x - ray emission in starbursts .",
    "the majority of starburst activity in the local universe occurs in galaxies with @xmath23 , e.g.  classic starbursts m82 , ngc 253 , or ngc 3628 .",
    "thus edge - on starburst galaxies such as these objects , at distances of @xmath24 mpc , provide the best observational data on superwinds .",
    "models such as starburst99 @xcite predict that the ratio of mechanical energy released by sne and stellar winds to the bolometric radiated power from a starburst is @xmath25 to 0.015 , where @xmath26 is proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "the fraction of the superwind mechanical power expected to emerge as soft x - ray emission is rather more uncertain .",
    "there are a variety of different theoretical models for the origin of the soft x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the merged sn ejecta driving the wind is too tenuous to provide significant x - ray emission , unless its density has been significantly increased by mass - loading ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of superwinds @xcite , where the emission is primarily due to shock heating of ambient disk and halo gas",
    ", we found @xmath27 , ( with higher values associated with mass - loaded models ) .",
    "similar values can be found if the @xcite wind - blown bubble model is applied to superwinds ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the soft x - ray emission is primarily from conductively - heated ambient gas at the wall of the bubble .",
    "combining these models , and including the scatter , theoretical models of starburst - driven winds predict @xmath28 .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of many classic starbursts have now demonstrated that the soft thermal x - ray emission from the superwinds is highly - structured and spatially correlated with h@xmath13 emission , as expected if the x - ray emission is generated by the interaction of the superwind with cool ambient gas . in many cases both",
    "the x - ray and h@xmath13 emission is strongly limb - brightened , indicating that the emission comes predominantly from the walls of the cavity carved by the superwind into the disk and halo medium of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the wind volume occupied by soft x - ray emitting gas is relatively low , with upper limits of @xmath29% of the soft x - ray emission coming from any volume - filling mass - loaded wind @xcite .",
    "both the total diffuse soft x - ray luminosity @xmath30 and the superwind emission at heights @xmath31 kpc from the disk @xmath32 , scale in direct proportion to the the host galaxies bolometric luminosity , @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite , remarkably tight correlations .",
    "chandra and xmm - newton observations of many dwarf starbursts ( @xmath35 ) and ulirgs ( @xmath36 ) are now available @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the diffuse x - ray emission in these objects are essentially the same as those of the classic starbursts , with similar spectral properties ( e.g.  relative @xmath13-to - fe abundances ) and @xmath37 ratios ( grimes , in preparation ) .",
    "the soft x - ray properties of many actively star - forming galaxies with spatially - extended soft x - ray emission are in accord with models of supernova - driven winds .",
    "but what of starburst galaxies",
    "that also host agn ?",
    "in general the outflows from classic starburst galaxies that also host llagn ( e.g.  ngc 253 , ngc 3079 ) do not differ from winds from pure starbursts ( e.g.  m82 , ngc 3628 , see @xcite ) . the one `` classic '' starburst",
    "that does appear unusual is ngc 4945 , which is also the host of a very peculiar x - ray - luminous agn that is probably heavily obscured along all lines of sight @xcite .",
    "although it has a x - ray and h@xmath13 nuclear outflow cone similar to ngc 253 , it is lacking in diffuse x - ray or h@xmath13 emission when compared to a starburst of the same _ total _ galactic bolometric luminosity , @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "however , the agn may dominate @xmath26 .",
    "if we assume that the diffuse x - ray emission is due to a starburst - driven wind alone , then the starburst must only account for @xmath24% of @xmath26 .",
    "in general , the large - scale soft x - ray emission in seyfert / starburst composite galaxies is consistent with a purely - starburst origin @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given total bolometric luminosity it appears that sne are more effective at driving galactic - scale winds than agn .. this does not imply that agn - driven galactic winds do not exist .",
    "there clearly are galaxies with agn but lacking starbursts that have galactic - scale ( i.e.  @xmath39 kpc ) outflows @xcite , but their local space density is lower than typical starburst superwind galaxies .",
    "many questions remain to be solved regarding the physics within superwinds , and their larger cosmological impact on galaxies and the igm .",
    "nevertheless , we have a good physical understanding of how sne within starbursts drive galactic - scale superwinds .",
    "the standard superwind conceptual model is almost two decades old , but modern observation validate it far more often than not .",
    "future research in this area , in particular the transition between starburst activity ( with superwinds ) and `` normal '' galaxies ( with or without galactic fountains ) , will strengthen our understanding of the interplay between sf , stars , and the ism in regulating galaxy assembly , structure and evolution .",
