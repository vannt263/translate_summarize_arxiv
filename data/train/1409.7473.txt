    "quantum memories that can store classical and/or quantum information are of fundamental importance in various anticipated quantum information technologies .",
    "for example , in quantum communication , quantum memories can be used to store entangled photons and form part of a quantum repeater for long distance distribution of entanglement @xcite . in particular , optical quantum memories that operate based on light - matter interaction , have emerged as attractive candidate realizations of quantum memories @xcite .",
    "experimental technologies for optical quantum memories can take on different forms , including optical delay lines , optical cavities , and trapped atomic ensembles ; see @xcite for a review of recent developments in optical quantum memories and @xcite for their prospective applications , such as on - demand single photon sources",
    ". a class of optical quantum memories based on atomic ensembles are photon - echo memories , which includes the so - called gradient - echo memories ( gem ) ( also going by the name controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) ) .",
    "modelling of gem as an infinite cascade of passive open quantum harmonic oscillators has been reported in @xcite , using the formalism of quantum stochastic differential equations @xcite and the series product for markovian open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "theoretical work has characterized the form of the wavepacket required for perfect absorption of a single photon optical state by a two - level system , the so - called rising exponential pulse @xcite .",
    "an experiment reported in @xcite demonstrates that , in the regime of low average photon numbers , a single atom has a higher excitation probability when driven by a coherent state with a rising exponential envelope . following this , a recent study of linearly coupled networks of open quantum harmonic oscillators ( realized as optical cavities or as a collective description of an atomic ensemble ) as quantum memories @xcite has lead to the formulation of the so - called zero - dynamics principle for perfect storage of a single photon optical state in this class of memories .",
    "this principle allowed a simple derivation of the form of the single photon wavepacket for perfect absorption by this class of memories .",
    "it turns out that the wavepacket is also of rising exponential type , as in @xcite . the present work is partly inspired by the linear quantum memory models studied in @xcite .",
    "quantum memories as quantum systems are very fragile and are susceptible to unwanted interactions with its ambient environment , resulting in destruction of superposition states prepared in that system , a phenomena known as decoherence .",
    "it is widely accepted that some form of control , be it open - loop control techniques such as dynamical decoupling , optimal control theory , etc , or quantum feedback control techniques , will be essential to the operation of emerging complex quantum technologies @xcite ; see @xcite for recent surveys of quantum control . in the context of quantum memories , in @xcite dynamical decoupling",
    "has been used to increase the storage time of classical light in an atomic ensemble .",
    "one form of quantum feedback control is coherent feedback @xcite , in which another quantum system , a quantum controller , is attached in a feedback interconnection with the controlled system without the intervention of any measurements in the feedback loop . to date ,",
    "various theoretical proposals of coherent feedback for different applications @xcite , as well as experimental demonstrations @xcite , have been reported in the literature .",
    "coherent feedback will play a key role in this work as an enabling tool .    in this paper",
    ", we propose three principles that lead to a _",
    "architecture for quantum memories that store qudit states encoded in pulsed optical fields .",
    "the first principle is to create a decoherence - free subsystem from two open optical cavity systems , even though individually none of them have a decoherence - free subsystem , by interconnecting them in coherent feedback loop .",
    "( after the completion of this work we became aware that yamamoto had earlier independently arrived at the same idea @xcite . however , our interconnection differs from the type-1 and type-2 interconnections studied in @xcite ) .",
    "storage of light in optical cavities is noted to suffer from limited efficiency due to a trade - off between short cycle of the cavities and long storage , suggesting they may not be suitable as quantum memories @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that two optical cavities can be connected in feedback to create a decoherence - free subsystem that , in the ideal situation , is completely protected from decoherence , has not been exploited before .",
    "this suggests that the full potential of optical cavities as quantum memories has yet to be explored .",
    "the second principle is that the system of two cavities can be readily switched from writing mode and storage mode for a qubit memory by merely rerouting some propagating fields that interconnect them ( with the light being stored in the decoherence free subsystem ) .",
    "finally , the third principle is that the basic quantum memory formed using the first and second principles from a module of which several can be connected together to form a compound quantum memory for storing qudit states .",
    "the paper exploits the interplay between decoherence - free subsystems , passive linear models of quantum memories , and certain fundamental notions from modern control theory @xcite .",
    "it is also partly motivated by a theory of coherent feedback control for disturbance attenuation @xcite that was subsequently confirmed in a tabletop quantum optics experiment in @xcite .",
    "coherent light was injected into one mirror of a bow - tie ( optical ) cavity , referred to as the _ plant _ , with two partially transmitting mirrors .",
    "the cavity plant is coupled in a feedback interconnection to another bow - tie cavity acting as a coherent feedback _",
    "controller_. when the controller cavity is appropriately designed , broadband destructive interference is engineered resulting in light being blocked out of one of the plant mirrors .",
    "this type of control strategy is relevant for quantum memories to minimize leakage of the stored state out of the memory , in accordance with the zero - dynamics principle in @xcite .",

    "a decoherence - free configuration is used for storage while a non - decoherence - free configuration allows `` opening up '' the cavities for writing - in the quantum state of the optical field and for retrieving a stored state .",
