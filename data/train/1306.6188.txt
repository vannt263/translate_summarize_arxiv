    "in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic ( relativistic heavy - ion collider ) and lhc ( large hadron collider ) , a hot deconfined state of strongly interacting matter is transiently created , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "this form of qcd matter is believed to have existed in the very first moments of our universe .",
    "as the produced hot and dense system cools down during its expansion , matter undergoes a transition from the qgp phase into a state dominated by color - confined , massive hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the nature of this phase transformation has been determined at vanishing baryon - chemical potential by first - principle lattice qcd simulations : it is an analytic crossover , taking place over a broad region of temperatures @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the value of the ( pseudo- ) critical temperature @xmath1 associated with this confinement transition depends to some extent on the considered order - parameter .",
    "for example , the _ wuppertal - budapest _ ( wb ) and _ hotqcd _ collaborations found comparable values for chiral symmetry restoration : @xmath2(@xmath3 )  mev in  @xcite and @xmath2(@xmath4 )  mev in  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the collective flow dynamics of the bulk of matter created in heavy ion collisions can be successfully modeled by means of relativistic hydrodynamics ( cf .  e.g.  the reviews in  @xcite ) , starting from a stage immediately after thermalization until the kinetic freeze - out of final state hadrons .",
    "assuming local thermal equilibrium , the conservation equations for energy , momentum and for the additionally conserved charges ( net - baryon number @xmath5 , net - electric charge @xmath6 and net - strangeness @xmath7 ) drive the evolution of the system .",
    "an essential ingredient for this modeling is the equation of state ( eos ) , which provides locally a relation between energy density @xmath8 , pressure @xmath9 and the densities @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the conserved charges .",
    "the parameter controlling the acceleration of the fluid collective flow due to pressure gradients is the speed of sound , @xmath13 .    a quantitative comparison of hydrodynamic simulations with the observed collective flow behavior revealed that the evolution of the system can be described by nearly ideal hydrodynamics , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "a uniquely small ratio of shear viscosity @xmath14 to entropy density @xmath15 of the hot matter was determined , cf .  also the reviews in  @xcite .",
    "this led to our current understanding of the qgp as a strongly coupled , nearly perfect fluid  @xcite . assuming the conservation of entropy , i.e.  neglecting the viscous entropy production associated with such a small @xmath16  @xcite , one needs to know the eos only along adiabatic paths . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the situation of a vanishing @xmath10 , i.e.  we consider the path @xmath17 . we note that in the thermal system created in a heavy - ion collision one always has @xmath18 , while @xmath11 ( in the case of a partial stopping at the lowest center - of - mass energies ) is related to @xmath10 .    a rigorous determination of the equation of state in thermal and chemical equilibrium for @xmath19 in the non - perturbative regime of qcd can be achieved with lattice gauge theory simulations .",
    "these reach nowadays unprecedented levels of accuracy .",
    "a basic quantity for the eos is the interaction measure @xmath20 , which has been calculated in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath21 in  @xcite show significant differences from those in  @xcite in the transition region . in this work ,",
    "we opt for utilizing the recent , continuum - extrapolated lattice qcd data from the wb - collaboration presented in  @xcite , corresponding to a system of 2 + 1 quark flavors with physical quark masses . by combining a suitable parametrization of these lattice qcd results with a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model in thermal and chemical equilibrium , we construct a baseline qcd equation of state for @xmath19 .",
    "the focus of our work lies , however , on the implementation of partial chemical equilibrium , i.e.  a non - equilibrium situation , in the hadronic phase . in this way",
    ", one can properly account for the actual chemical composition in the confined phase , an issue which is not addressed within equilibrium lattice qcd thermodynamics .",
    "this is known to be of importance in order to reproduce not only the experimentally observed flow and @xmath22-spectra , but also the correct particle ratios  @xcite .",
    "because of the present uncertainty in the exact value of the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath23 , cf .",
    "@xcite , we consider various values for @xmath23 within the expected range , below which the hrg is assumed to be in partial chemical equilibrium . in this way , different realistic qcd equations of state are obtained , which can be used in the hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic heavy - ion collisions for lhc and rhic top beam energies at mid - rapidity when net - baryon density effects can be neglected . having such qcd equations of state at hand will allow to study the possible impact of a variation of @xmath24  mev in @xmath23 on particle spectra as well as a more controlled determination of the qgp transport properties , as for example the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients . at smaller beam energies , effects of a non - vanishing net - baryon density",
    "become important .",
    "corresponding qcd equations of state will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the equation of state of qcd matter has been the subject of numerous studies in the literature . among different other approaches ,",
    "we mention combinations of the hrg model with an effective theory of qcd  @xcite , with a phenomenological model for qcd thermodynamics  @xcite and with various parametrizations  @xcite of lattice qcd results .",
    "developments in using a parametrization of lattice qcd results for finite @xmath10 were recently reported in  @xcite . moreover , in  @xcite an eos , describing both the qgp and the hadronic phase based on one effective model approach , was constructed and applied in finite-@xmath10 hydrodynamics studies ( see also further developments in  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we discuss briefly the employed lattice qcd results  @xcite and their combination with a hrg model in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] deals with the inclusion of partial chemical equilibrium in the description of the hadronic phase . in section  [ sec:4",
    "] , we discuss the obtained qcd equations of state and provide practical parametrizations of our results .",
    "in  @xcite , continuum - extrapolated lattice gauge theory results of qcd thermodynamics for 2 + 1 quark flavors with physical mass parameters were presented .",
    "the corresponding results for the scaled interaction measure @xmath21 and for the scaled pressure @xmath25 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "a suitable parametrization of the results for @xmath21 as a function of @xmath0 , which provides an accurate description within the given error - band , can be found by employing a similar fit function as the one used in  @xcite . from this , the other thermodynamic quantities follow via thermodynamic identities : the scaled pressure is determined by a definite @xmath0-integral of @xmath26 , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this yields for @xmath29 extrapolated to @xmath30  mev a value of about @xmath31 of the _ stefan - boltzmann _",
    "limit for a non - interacting gas of 3 massless quark flavors .",
    "the thermodynamics of qcd matter in the hadronic phase can be well accounted for by the hrg model describing hadronic matter in thermal and chemical equilibrium , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the pressure of the model in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath32 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over all hadronic ( including resonances ) states @xmath33 ( baryons and anti - baryons being summed independently ) included in the model . in eq .",
    "( [ equ : pressurehrg ] ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the degeneracy factor and the mass , and @xmath36 is the chemical potential of the hadron - species @xmath33 . in chemical equilibrium ,",
    "the latter reads @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the respective quantum numbers of baryon charge , electric charge and strangeness , while @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the chemical potentials associated with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "other thermodynamic quantities follow from standard relations , e.g.  @xmath44 .",
    "the particle number density of species @xmath33 , @xmath45 , is given by the momentum - integral @xmath46 and the net - baryon density follows from @xmath47 .",
    "since we consider @xmath19 , all @xmath36 are set to zero in the chemical equilibrium case .    in this work ,",
    "we employ a hrg model containing states up to a mass of @xmath48  gev as , for example , listed in the edition  @xcite of the particle data book .",
    "such a list is also included in the eos - package provided along with the work in  @xcite . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , this choice is sufficient to describe the available lattice qcd data fairly well for temperatures below @xmath49  mev , where hrg and lattice qcd results mostly overlap .",
    "in fact , the relative deviation of the hrg model from the lattice qcd data  @xcite in this overlap region , taking the error - bars in the data into account , is at most @xmath50 in @xmath21 and @xmath51 in @xmath25 .    given the reasonable agreement between lattice qcd data and the hrg model , we construct an equation of state , which serves as a baseline eos for the chemical equilibrium case : we utilize our suitable parametrization of the lattice qcd results from  @xcite at high @xmath0 and change the prescription to the above discussed hrg model at low @xmath0 around a switching temperature of @xmath52  mev .",
    "generically , such an approach can introduce discontinuities in the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we improve this situation by employing a straightforward interpolation procedure between the two parts in the interval @xmath53  mev  @xmath54  mev , which ensures that the pressure and its first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath0 are continuous . in this way",
    ", the speed of sound remains a smooth function for all temperatures .",
    "a similar strategy was applied for the construction of the qcd equation of state in  @xcite .",
    "in heavy - ion collisions , the time scales for inelastic particle number changing processes , which are responsible for the chemical equilibration of the hadronic matter , are typically much larger than the lifetime of the hadronic stage  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is more realistic to assume that the hadronic phase is not in complete chemical equilibrium .",
    "this was first discussed in  @xcite and then considered in numerous works , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite : according to this idea , hadronic matter is formed at the hadronization temperature @xmath1 in chemical equilibrium . however , for temperatures below the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath23 , where @xmath55 , the inelastic processes become suppressed , while the elastic interactions mediated by frequent strong resonance formations and decays ( e.g. @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 etc ) continue to occur .",
    "consequently , the experimentally observed ratios of particle multiplicities of those species @xmath59 , which are stable against strong decays within the lifetime of the system , are fixed at @xmath23 . this is to say that for @xmath60 the corresponding effective particle numbers @xmath61 are frozen . here",
    ", @xmath62 denotes the actual particle number of the stable hadron @xmath59 , @xmath63 the actual particle number of resonance @xmath64 and @xmath65 gives the average number of hadrons @xmath59 produced in the decay of resonance @xmath64 .",
    "for example , the conserved quantity in the process @xmath56 is the effective pion number @xmath66 .",
    "the above sum has to be taken over all the states ( resonances ) that decay into hadron @xmath59 within the lifetime of the hadronic stage . as their effective number is fixed at @xmath23 , but @xmath0 decreases during the expansion of matter , each stable particle species @xmath59 acquires an effective , @xmath0-dependent chemical potential @xmath67 .",
    "the chemical potentials of the resonances , instead , can be written as a combination @xmath68 of the effective chemical potentials of the stable hadrons .",

    "nevertheless , the focus of our work lay on the inclusion of partial chemical equilibrium for a more accurate description of the experimental situation , where we studied different values for the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath23 within the range presently expected from first - principle approaches  @xcite . in view of the non - negligible differences in the temperature and chemical potential evolution of the system for different @xmath23-values our work ,",
    "thus , allows one to study the possible influence of deviations in @xmath23 on the particle spectra in more detail compared to the work presented in  @xcite .",
    "our results , being available in a tabulated form  @xcite , can be directly applied in the hydrodynamic modeling of high - energy heavy - ion collisions at the lhc and at rhic for top beam energies . for convenience",
    ", we also provided practical parametrizations of our results , in particular , for the effective chemical potentials @xmath67 of the stable hadrons in the partial chemical equilibrium case and for the temperature .",
    "their knowledge is crucial for a determination of final state hadron abundances and spectra .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the @xmath19 case in this work . in general , however , our approach allows for respecting the conservation of finite values for @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( while @xmath173 ) as relevant for heavy - ion collisions .",
