    "future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are being designed to measure the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath1 and the mass hierarchy .",
    "we evaluate the performance of such an experiment within laguna  @xcite , optimizing and comparing the performances of seven different baselines and three detector technologies . in particular , we focus on a super - beam ( sb ) experiment based at cern .",
    "sb fluxes have been optimized for each baseline according to the first oscillation peak  @xcite . in the lower energy configuration for the beam ( for @xmath2 km )",
    "the fluxes have been obtained assuming @xmath3 protons on target ( pot ) per year , with an energy of @xmath4 gev .",
    "we assume 2 years of @xmath5 running and 8 years of @xmath6 running in this case , as in ref .",
    "higher energy fluxes ( for setups with @xmath7 km ) correspond to the cern high - power ps2 configuration  @xcite : @xmath8 pot per year , with an energy of @xmath9 gev .",
    "we assume @xmath10 years in this case , though , since we have checked that an asymmetric configuration is only marginally beneficial only for the @xmath0 discovery potential of the experiment .",
    "we use the globes software  @xcite in all our simulations .",
    "marginalization has been performed over solar and atmospheric parameters , according to their present best - fits and @xmath11 errors  @xcite .",
    "whenever we marginalize over @xmath0 and @xmath12 we leave them completely free .",
    "a conservative @xmath13 uncertainty has been taken over the prem profile  @xcite .",
    "full details used for the simulation of the detectors response can be found in @xcite .",
    "information about the liquid argon ( lar ) detector has been obtained from refs .",
    "@xcite with migration matrices provided by l.  esposito and a.  rubbia .",
    "information about the liquid scintillator ( ls ) detector has been obtained from refs .",
    "the rejection capability for the neutral - current ( nc ) events at the ls detector is currently under study .",
    "therefore , we have considered that a certain percentage of the total amount of unoscillated nc events will be misidentified as charged - current ( cc ) events and we have varied it within @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "finally , for the wc detector we have considered two different configurations : for the lower energy beam configuration we have used the same details as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , for the higher energy setups we have followed refs .",
    "the migration matrices in this case have been kindly provided by the lbne collaboration  @xcite , as well as the rejection efficiencies for the nc background events .",
    "for all detectors we assume the level of the intrinsic electron background to be the same as the signal efficiency .",
    "full results of the optimization studies can be found in ref .",
    "we studied the effects of the nc background , the intrinsic beam background , the values of the systematic errors , the influence of the spectral information on the results , the ratio of @xmath15 running , and the possibility of tau detection .",
    "the intrinsic beam background is only relevant in case of small @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the spectral information is vital for improving the cp discovery potential : quasi - elastic events are mostly relevant in the region @xmath17 , while deep inelastic events are vital in the region where @xmath18 . for high energy configurations of the beam",
    ", we find that equal @xmath5 and @xmath6 running times give better results than asymmetric configurations . finally , tau detection is not only very challenging , but it does not significantly improve the sensitivity to oscillation parameters for any of our setups .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sys ] , we show our results for the impact of systematic errors ( left panel ) and the nc background ( right panel ) on the cp discovery potential for the lar and ls detectors , respectively .",
    "results are shown for the pyhsalmi baseline , but a similar dependence is expected for the rest of locations . in the left panel , the first ( second ) value in the legend corresponds to the systematic uncertainty over the signal ( background ) , which are taken to be completely uncorrelated .",
    "it can be seen that , while the signal systematics is mostly relevant in the region where @xmath17 , background systematics are only relevant below @xmath19 . in the right panel ,",
    "the value in the legend indicates the percentage of the toatl number of unoscillated nc events that are misidentified as cc events .",
    "it can be seen that the results in this case are worsened around a factor of 2 when the nc background is increased from a @xmath14 to a @xmath13 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     * results for the mass hierarchy discovery potential : * we find that the length of the baseline is crucial in order to determine the mass hierarchy , regardless of the detector technology .",
    "the best results are obtained for the lar , wc and ls with @xmath14 nc background placed at 2300 km : the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy in this case reaches @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "the results for the second baseline in length , @xmath24 km , are very close to these and reach @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 if @xmath23 .",
    "the results obtained at @xmath28 and @xmath29 km are around an order of magnitude worse than these , and the rest of baselines lie in between .",
    "finally , the hierarchy discovery potential is zero for any of the detectors placed at @xmath2 km due to the absence of matter effects .",
