    "the most general method of implementing an operation using entanglement and classical communication may be described as follows .",
    "the @xmath3 parties share an entangled resource state , and perform many rounds of the following process .",
    "each party performs a local unitary followed by a partial measurement .",
    "the parties then communicate classical information about the measurement results , and repeat the process with local unitaries and measurements possibly depending on the transmitted information .",
    "in general we consider many implementations of @xmath5 , and regard the scheme as successful if the minimum fidelity of the output state approaches one as the number of copies of @xmath5 approaches infinity .",
    "we may define a sufficient rate vector @xmath6 as a vector of measures of multipartite entanglement and classical communication such that , for all @xmath7 there exists an @xmath8 such that @xmath8 implementations of @xmath5 may be performed using average entanglement and classical communication no larger than the components of @xmath6 , and minimum fidelity at least @xmath9 .",
    "the scheme of cirac , dr , kraus and lewenstein ( cdkl ) @xcite is of this form .",
    "joint measurements between an entangled resource state and the target system are made .",
    "the correct measurement result means that the operation is correctly performed .",
    "if failure occurs , another resource state is used , and measurement success corrects for the previous failure and correctly implements the unitary . for repeated failure",
    "this process is repeated until the operation which is required may be performed locally .    in the following",
    "we improve on the cdkl scheme in three ways : + 1 .",
    "we reduce the entanglement consumption .",
    "we reduce the communication in most directions to be the same as the entanglement consumption .",
    "we apply the scheme to more general hamiltonians .",
    "first we give an improved scheme which reduces the entanglement consumed .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath4 for @xmath3 parties , so the unitary we wish to apply is @xmath10 .",
    "this is the multipartite generalisation of the hamiltonian considered by cdkl .",
    "( we use @xmath11 here rather than @xmath12 , but these are equivalent under local unitaries . )    the @xmath3 parties use the resource state @xmath13 then apply a four step process . in the following we use the `` stator '' formalism , introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a stator is a hybrid state - operator object , and acts upon a state by applying its operator component to the state , and appending its state component .",
    "that is , the stator acts on @xmath14 as @xmath15 linearity is used to obtain the action of stators which are sums of terms of the form @xmath16 .",
    "the four steps are as follows : + step 1 .",
    "each party applies a controlled-@xmath17 operation on the target system .",
    "this yields the stator @xmath18 step 2 .",
    "parties 1 to @xmath19 apply hadamard operations followed by computational basis measurements on their component of the resource state .",
    "the resulting stator is @xmath20 where the sign is @xmath21 if the number of measurement results equal to 1 is even , and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "party @xmath3 performs a correction on their component of the resource state based on the measurement results .",
    "if the number of measurement results equal to 1 is odd , then they perform a @xmath11 operation on the remaining portion of the resource state .",
    "we then obtain the stator with the plus in eq .  .",
    "party @xmath3 applies a projection measurement on their component of the resource state .",
    "projection onto the state @xmath23 yields the unitary operation proportional to @xmath24 for failure , projection onto the state @xmath25 is obtained , giving an operation proportional to @xmath26    the measurement in step 4 is chosen such that , for the correct measurement result , the unitary @xmath27 is applied .",
    "this will be obtained provided @xmath28 for the incorrect measurement result , the unitary is of the form @xmath29 , but with @xmath30 . to obtain the correct result",
    ", we now wish to implement the unitary .",
    "combined with the previous incorrect unitary @xmath29 , this will result in the desired @xmath27 . to achieve this ,",
    "one requires a new resource state @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is not in general equal to @xmath33 ) and repeats the process .",
    "if the incorrect measurement result is obtained repeatedly , one can obtain the correct unitary by using the resource state @xmath34 .",
    "one can deterministically perform any unitary of the form @xmath27 with this resource state . to see this , consider steps 1 to 4 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then , in the case of failure one simply applies the local unitary @xmath37 .    in the following the terminology `` stage '' is used to mean steps 1 to 4 .",
    "the notation @xmath38 is used for the parameter for the entangled resource state used in stage @xmath39 ( i.e.  after @xmath40 failures ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath41 is used for the parameter for the unitary we wish to implement in stage @xmath39 .",
    "that is , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the unitary we require for the correction after one failure , and so forth .",
    "we also use @xmath44 for the maximum total number of stages .    if @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , this method is similar to that of cdkl . at each stage",
    "the probability of success is equal to 1/2 , and for repeated failure we need to implement @xmath37 , which may be performed locally .",
    "the resource state is different from that used by cdkl , but the average entanglement consumed is identical .    to improve upon the entanglement consumption we adjust the entanglement of the resource states . by using resource states with larger entanglement ,",
    "the probability for success is increased , and the average entanglement consumed is reduced .",
    "it is straightforward to numerically optimise for the resource states that minimise the average entanglement consumed for given @xmath48 . the resulting average entanglement is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] as a function of @xmath48 .     as a function of @xmath48 .",

    "@xcite is shown as the dashed line.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the entanglement consumed for the cdkl scheme is also shown in fig .",
    "the cdkl scheme is explicitly given for values of @xmath48 of the form @xmath49 .",
    "however , it is trivial to apply it to other values of @xmath48 by making an expansion @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "the entanglement consumed may then be determined by summing it over that for the individual terms .",
    "this is how the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] were determined .",
    "for all values of @xmath48 ( except the trivial @xmath52 ) the entanglement consumed for the numerically optimised scheme is less than that for the cdkl scheme . for small @xmath48 the entanglement consumed",
    "is approximately @xmath53 , as compared to @xmath2 for the cdkl scheme .    to show that the entanglement consumed is approximately @xmath53 in the limit of small @xmath48 , we may use the following approach .",
    "first we determine the entanglement required to implement @xmath54 for values of @xmath55 over a range of a factor of two . here",
    "we take @xmath56 . now for values of @xmath48 below @xmath57 , we select an @xmath55 in the range @xmath58 , such that @xmath59 . then , rather than numerically optimising for the best intermediate entangled states , we select the intermediate entangled states with @xmath60 for @xmath61 , so @xmath47 . if a successful measurement has not been obtained before stage @xmath62 , then the correction required is @xmath54 ; this may be achieved using the numerically optimised scheme .",
    "the average entanglement consumed is @xmath63 where we use @xmath64 for the entanglement consumed to implement @xmath27 , and @xmath65 for the entanglement of the resource state @xmath66 .",
    "we have @xmath67 $ ] where @xmath68 is the binary entropy function @xmath69 .",
    "this entanglement measure is the entropy of the reduced density operator for one subsystem .",
    "this is a consistent entanglement measure for schmidt decomposable multipartite pure states .",
    "it is possible to apply similar methods to the bipartite case to perform entanglement concentration and dilution between these states and the standard states @xmath34 @xcite .    the first term in eq .",
    "is the probability for @xmath8 failures ( @xmath70 ) multiplied by the entanglement required to implement @xmath54 .",
    "the sum is the entanglement of the state with @xmath71 for steps 1 to @xmath8 multiplied by the probability .",
    ".   gives the upper bound @xmath72    the expression on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "is independent of @xmath8 , and only depends on @xmath55 .",
    "this expression is plotted as a function of @xmath55 in fig .  [ rat ] ( the irregularity appears to be due to finite precision ) .",
    "it can be seen that this expression does not exceed @xmath73 for this range of @xmath55 .",
    "thus we find that , in the limit of small @xmath48 , the entanglement consumed need not exceed @xmath53 .",
    "[ the rhs of eq .  ] minus 5.6418 as a function of @xmath55.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this proof is not fully rigorous because it is not possible to determine the rhs of eq .   for all values of @xmath55 in this range . for rigour , note that @xmath48 may be expanded as @xmath50 , and the simulation of @xmath27 may be achieved by simulation of the appropriate @xmath74 .",
    "in practice , this method is more complicated , however .",
    "another issue is that the above analysis is in terms of the expectation value of the entanglement consumed , given that one is provided with entangled states on demand .",
    "alternatively we may consider many implementations of the unitary with a fixed set of entangled resource states .",
    "this is consistent with the definition given in sec .",
    "[ sec : gen ] .",
    "let @xmath75 be the probability of requiring the entangled resource state in stage @xmath39 ( i.e.  the probability of @xmath40 failures ) .",
    "now , for all @xmath76 , there exists an @xmath77 such that the probability of the number of entangled resource states required in stage @xmath39 exceeding @xmath78 is no more than @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , let us consider @xmath77 implementations of @xmath27 with @xmath80 copies of resource state @xmath81 at each stage .",
    "then the total entanglement does not exceed @xmath82 .",
    "in the case that the number of resource states exceeds that provided in one of the stages , let the output state be @xmath83 . otherwise the correct output state @xmath84 is obtained .",
    "after discarding the measurement results , the average output state is of the form @xmath85 because the total probability of requiring more than the number of resource states provided in stage @xmath39 is no more than @xmath79 , the total probability of failure does not exceed @xmath86 .",
    "therefore the fidelity must be at least @xmath9 .",
    "thus we find that , given sufficiently large @xmath77 , the average entanglement consumed is arbitrarily close to @xmath64 with fidelity arbitrarily close to 1 .",
    "the next issue to consider is that of the classical communication required . at stage @xmath39 the set of entangled resource states is of the form @xmath87^{\\otimes m_l},\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the number of entangled states used in stage @xmath39 , and is equal to @xmath80 .",
    "we may alternatively express this state as @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "now we make an approximation to the state @xmath93 by retaining only typical sequences of the @xmath94 .",
    "denoting the set of typical @xmath95 by @xmath96 , the approximate state is @xmath97 it is a standard result for typical sequences that , for all @xmath76 , there exists an @xmath88 such that the fidelity is at least @xmath98 with the number of elements in @xmath96 no more than @xmath99 .    because fidelity does not decrease under completely - positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps , the fidelity of the final state with the output for the exact state must be at least @xmath98 . in the case where we use approximate resource states with typical sequences at each stage ,",
    "the final output must have fidelity at least @xmath9 with the state obtained with the exact resource states , @xmath100 .",
    "the fidelity with the desired state , @xmath84 , is then at least @xmath101 .",
    "now , to reduce the average communication required , we replace step 2 with a joint measurement in the fourier transform basis on the states @xmath102 for typical sequences by parties 1 to @xmath19 .",
    "the communication required for the measurement result does not exceed @xmath103 bits . using the expression for @xmath88 , this does not exceed @xmath104 .",
    "there are a number of different ways this communication may be performed .",
    "the communication may be performed from party 1 to 2 , then the sum ( modulo @xmath105 ) communicated to party 3 , and so forth up to the communication to party @xmath3 .",
    "alternatively the communication may be performed directly from each party ( 1 to @xmath19 ) to party @xmath3 .",
    "many other combinations of communication are possible , provided it is possible for party @xmath3 to determine the sum ( modulo @xmath105 ) of the measurement results .    after this communication is performed , we simply perform step 4 as above .",
    "now it is necessary to communicate the positions of the measurement successes from party @xmath3 to the other parties .",
    "it does not appear to be possible to reduce this communication via the typical sequences approach as it does for the other communication .    the average total communication from each party 1 to @xmath19 does not exceed @xmath106 .",
    "thus , in the limit of small @xmath107 , this communication is the same as the entanglement consumed .",
    "the communication from party @xmath3 will , in general , be much larger , and does not scale down with @xmath48 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] the communication required is over 9 bits for the smallest ( nonzero ) value of @xmath48 plotted .",
    "it is also possible to select the entangled resources to minimise the average communication required from the last party . in this case",
    "numerical results indicate that the optimal scheme uses an entangled resource with @xmath108 . for small @xmath48 ,",
    "the probability of failure is small . in the case of failure we simply implement the scheme with 1 ebit of entanglement and 1 bit of communication in each direction .",
    "the corresponding classical communication is shown in fig .  [ comopt ] .",
    "the classical communication is still larger than the entanglement for the scheme optimised for minimum entanglement consumption .",
    "however , it does go to zero in the limit of small @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately the ratio of the classical communication to @xmath48 is not bounded for small @xmath48 ( see fig.[unbou ] ) .",
    "the ratio increases approximately as @xmath109 .",
    "this means that a scheme based on implementing a series of operations of the form @xmath27 will still require a large amount of communication from the last party .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown how to implement evolution under a hamiltonian of the form @xmath4 .",
    "now we show how to implement a general tensor product hamiltonian of the form @xmath110 . to do this ,",
    "we apply a method similar to that in ref .",
    "first note that it is possible to diagonalise the @xmath111 via local unitaries .",
    "taking @xmath112 , the diagonalised form of @xmath113 is @xmath114 where @xmath115 $ ] , and @xmath116 is the dimension of the subsystem which @xmath111 acts upon . in the following we consider simulation of this diagonalised form .",
    "this hamiltonian may be simulated by the hamiltonian @xmath117 in a similar way as in ref .",
    "the chain of simulations used is @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "we use the @xmath120 subscripts to indicate the subsystems upon which we wish to implement @xmath113 , and @xmath121 to indicate ancilla subsystems .    in order to perform this chain of simulations , we need to , in general , perform the simulation @xmath122 to do this , we first append the @xmath116 dimensional ancilla @xmath121 so the @xmath123th term in the tensor product is @xmath124 .",
    "now we take @xmath125 $ ] , and define the local unitaries @xmath126 which exchange the @xmath127-th and @xmath128-th basis vectors of @xmath129 . to simulate @xmath130 for small time @xmath131 , we simply apply @xmath126 at time @xmath132 and again at time @xmath131 . in this way",
    ", we may apply each successive simulation in the chain .",
    "the final simulation in the chain may be achieved by simply restricting to the appropriate subspace .",
    "@xcite gave a similar method for the case of bipartite tensor product hamiltonians ( though the multipartite case was mentioned briefly in the discussion ) .",
    "in the bipartite case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the simulation is reversible .",
    "this is because the diagonal hamiltonian may be expanded as a sum of local hamiltonians and a hamiltonian for which the maximum and minimum eigenvalues have the same magnitude .",
    "the local hamiltonians may be ignored , because they can be implemented locally .",
    "one can then use @xmath133 to simulate @xmath4 by restricting to the subspace for the maximum and minimum eigenvalues . in the multipartite case we can not use a similar method , because the additional terms will be multipartite hamiltonians on @xmath19 subsystems , rather than local hamiltonians .",
    "the case of self - inverse hamiltonian evolution , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , is particularly simple .",
    "all the @xmath134 are @xmath135 , so it is possible to achieve the entire simulation chain without intermediate unitaries simply by restricting to the appropriate subspaces .",
    "thus self - inverse hamiltonian evolution is equivalent to evolution under @xmath4 .    in order to simulate evolution under @xmath113 for a time interval @xmath136",
    ", we divide the time interval into @xmath137 intervals of length @xmath138 . for @xmath137",
    "sufficiently large , the chain of simulations above will be accurate .",
    "the expectation value for the consumed entanglement is then no more than @xmath139 .",
    "in fact , the expectation value is approximately equal to this , because each simulation of @xmath27 is for @xmath140 . as above",
    ", we may also obtain an asymptotic average entanglement consumed equal to this value in the limit of a large number of implementations of @xmath113 . also the asymptotic average communication from each of the parties @xmath141",
    "may be made equal to this value .",
    "note that it is necessary to consider a large number of implementations of the hamiltonian for small time intervals , because in addition to the division of @xmath136 into @xmath137 intervals in order to make the simulations in eq .",
    "accurate , the simulations in eq .",
    "require further subdivision of the time .",
    "however , for a given fidelity @xmath9 required , the number of subintervals is fixed , so there is no problem in taking the appropriate limits to obtain the average entanglement and communication .",
    "we can also use the above methods to simulate more general hamiltonians of the form @xmath142 , where each @xmath143 is a tensor product hamiltonian .",
    "we simply implement @xmath144 . for large @xmath137",
    ", this simulation may be made arbitrarily accurate .",
    "the average entanglement consumed is approximately @xmath145 . for completely general",
    "hamiltonians a large number of terms in the sum will be required , so this method will not be efficient .",
    "however , it should be useful for cases with only a moderate number of terms required .",
    "we may generalise the above methods to general unitaries of the form @xmath146 where the @xmath147 are local unitaries , and @xmath148 is small except for the @xmath149 such that @xmath150 . to implement this operation",
    ", we use an entangled resource state of the form @xmath151 we use @xmath121 for the subsystems for the resource state , and @xmath120 for the subsystems for the system state ( which we wish to apply @xmath5 to ) .",
    "each party @xmath123 performs the controlled operation @xmath152 , where @xmath147 acts upon @xmath120 . as a result",
    ", we have the stator @xmath153 acting upon the system .",
    "each party performs local measurements , and communicates the results to party @xmath3 , where the phase correction is made .",
    "we then perform a projective measurement on the resource state in subsystem @xmath154 , with success corresponding to projection onto the state @xmath155 .",
    "choosing @xmath156 , @xmath5 is implemented in the case of success .    in the case of failure a different unitary operation",
    "is performed .",
    "this case may be corrected for by implementing the correction in the same way , or alternatively by teleporting the portions of the state in subsystems @xmath157 to @xmath158 to party @xmath3 , performing the appropriate unitary , then teleporting these portions of the state back to their respective subsystems .",
    "for example , we may use this approach with two - qubit unitaries .",
    "two - qubit unitaries may be simplified to the form @xcite @xmath159 where we take the convention that @xmath160 . in the case of the incorrect measurement result ,",
    "the error operation is again of this form , and we wish to implement an operation of this form for the correction . repeating the process , we may implement the unitary in a more direct way than by implementing a sequence of unitaries of the form @xmath27 .",
    "however , calculations indicate that this method consumes more entanglement",
    ".    one use of this approach would be to implement the operation with small classical communication in all directions .",
    "as discussed at the end of sec.[sec : clascom ] , it is possible to optimise for minimum communication from the last party , however the ratio of the classical communication to @xmath48 is not bounded .",
    "this means that , if we use this method for more general tensor product hamiltonians , the average communication from the last party is still going to be large . on the other hand , using the approach given in this section , we can ensure that the average communication required approaches zero in the limit as @xmath5 approaches the identity . by selecting @xmath161",
    ", we find that the probability of failure approaches zero as @xmath5 approaches the identity .",
    "we have presented a scheme for implementing evolution under general multipartite tensor product hamiltonians .",
    "this scheme requires multipartite entanglement of approximately @xmath139 . in contrast , the scheme of cdkl @xcite , which applies to the @xmath162 interaction , requires entanglement of @xmath163 .",
    "this scheme may be applied both to the case of a single implementation , in which case this is the expectation value of the entanglement consumption , or to multiple implementations .    in the case of multiple implementations ,",
    "the entanglement consumption is the average over the implementations , given that the implementations are achieved with arbitrarily high fidelity .",
    "in addition , for multiple implementations the average communication in some of the directions may be reduced to be equal to the entanglement consumption . however",
