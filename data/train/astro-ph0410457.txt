    "in a recent paper @xcite we presented the deepest yet radio image of ss433 , which revealed an historical record over two complete precession periods of the geometry of the jets .",
    "detailed analysis of this image revealed systematic deviations from the standard kinematic model @xcite .",
    "variations in jet speed , lasting for as long as tens of days , were needed to match the detailed structure of each jet . remarkably , these variations in speed were equal , matching the two jets simultaneously .",
    "the doppler residuals to the kinematic model show little variation with the precessional phase of the jets and this observation rules out variations in jet speed _",
    "alone _ as the source of the residuals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very little phase variation is obtained if the pointing angle jitters @xcite but there is no evidence excluding symmetric speed variations of the magnitude reported in @xcite superposed on pointing jitter , fig[fig : varywithphase ] .",
    "thus our findings from the radio image led us to re - analyse the archival optical data .",
    "g.  collins ii and s.  eikenberry ( with kind permission of b.  margon ) made available their compiled datasets , published in @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "we use the collins compilation ( available at http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/@xmath0kmb/ss433/ ) because of its higher quoted precision , but very similar results are obtained from margon s .",
    "if the precessing jet axis of ss433 traces out a cone of semi - angle @xmath1 about a line which is oriented at an angle @xmath2 to our line - of - sight with jet velocity @xmath3 in units of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , the redshifts measured from the west jet ( @xmath6 ) and the east jet ( @xmath7 ) are given , if the jets are symmetric , by : @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the phase of the precession cycle ( see http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/@xmath0kmb/ss433/ ) .",
    "addition of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in eqn[eq : redshift ] gives an expression relating the observed redshifts to the jet speed independently of any angular variation .",
    "re - arrangement gives @xmath10^{-2 }   \\right ] ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath11 fluctuates very substantially ( see fig[fig : resids_v_time ] ) .",
    "subtraction of the expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 gives the angular properties @xmath12 of the orientation of the jet axis , with the speed divided out using eqn[eq : sum ] : @xmath13    fluctuations in @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath9 are predominantly symmetric , as described by eqns 13 , when fluctuations in @xmath14 represent symmetric fluctuations in speed .",
    "( the velocity variations in the two radio jets @xcite are highly symmetric ; the standard deviation on the difference in the speeds is less than @xmath15 and on the common velocity @xmath16 . )",
    "the disadvantages of the variables @xmath17 and @xmath12 ( eqn[eq : ang ] ) are that their interpretation is simple only for perfect symmetry and that they may only be used for the 395 out of 486 observations which record a simultaneous pair .",
    "their merits are exemplified by fourier analyses of the time distributions .",
    "we used the algorithm of @xcite which accounts for the uneven time - sampling of the data .",
    "the angular data @xmath12 clearly revealed periodicities corresponding to the nodding of the precession axis @xcite and the 162-day precession period , clearly seen in fig[fig : ft]a . there is no periodicity in the speed data @xmath18 ( fig[fig : ft]b ) common to the angular data , consistent with perfect symmetry .",
    "the speed data also indicate a periodicity at 13.08days ( the periodicity at 12.58days matches a beat with earth s orbital period 365days ) ; to investigate this , we folded the data over 13.08days in 20 phase bins , and in each bin the mean speed ( @xmath3 , from eqn[eq : sum ] ) was derived .",
    "fig[fig : fold ] shows a clear sinusoidal oscillation with orbital phase . the rms variation in speed which oscillates with orbital phase is smaller by a factor of three than the overall speed dispersion .",
    "this oscillation with amplitude @xmath19 may be because the speed with which the bolides are ejected is a function of orbital phase , but the excursions in fig[fig : fold ] could also be interpreted as due to orbital motion ; in that case ss433 s orbital speed is @xmath20 .",
    "we fitted collins dataset with the kinematic model , including nodding . from our fit , we derived model redshift pairs and hence the variables @xmath18 and @xmath12 .",
    "subtraction of these model variables from those constructed from the data gave residuals @xmath21 in @xmath18 and @xmath22 in @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath3 variation is shown in fig[fig : resids_v_time]c .",
    "the standard deviation of this histogram is 0.013 , in excellent agreement with the result from our radio image ( 0.014 ) .",
    "examples of the residuals in @xmath18 and in the angular variable @xmath12 are plotted in fig[fig : resids_v_time ] ; the variations in speed and angular residuals are anti - correlated . from eqns[eq : redshift][eq : ang ] , maintaining the assumption of symmetry :    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the variations in @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "averaging over many cycles for any given value of the phase @xmath9 yields the averages @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 as functions of @xmath9 , in terms of the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and so on .",
    "the fit to @xmath34 is shown in fig[fig : a_s ] .",
    "the parameters are given in table[tab : fits ] ; the global @xmath35 is 34.8/24 , where @xmath36 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "fig[fig : a_s ] shows that the quantity @xmath37 has an almost pure cosinusoidal variation with phase , as given by the first term on the right hand side of eqn[eq : as ] .",
    "this shape is the unique signature of a correlation between variations in @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath38 shows no correlation with @xmath9 and @xmath29 very little .",
    "the latter requires fluctuations in both @xmath1 and in @xmath9 .",
    "we remark that @xmath39 does not show a strong correlation with @xmath9 ; nor should it , using the parameters from table 1 . removing",
    "the varying speed from @xmath40 was crucial in revealing this correlation in @xmath41 .",
    "consider the plane of redshift residuals , as in figure  5 of @xcite , with symmetric excursions from the kinematic model in @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",
    "comparison of their figure  5 ( similar to our fig[fig : eikfigfive]f ) with our figs[fig : eikfigfive]a and [ fig : eikfigfive]b requires the presence of both angular variations ( to spread the points along the line @xmath42 ) and velocity variations ( to spread the points perpendicular to this line  note that even their quoted redshift measurement error of 0.003 , likely an over - estimate , will not account for this breadth ) .",
    "inclusion of all these variations , correlated as in table[tab : fits ] , gives fig[fig : eikfigfive]d which resembles that from the data ( fig[fig : eikfigfive]f ) .",
    "the simulations in fig[fig : eikfigfive]d take no account of the ( stochastic ) duration of the excursions ; the duration of variations in fig[fig : eikfigfive]e were drawn from a gaussian with half - width 2days .",
    "thus figs[fig : varywithphase ] and [ fig : eikfigfive ] establish the consistency of the optical data with perfect symmetry and with speed fluctuations whose magnitude is in excellent agreement with those found in the radio image .",
    "in addition , the slope of fig[fig : eikfigfive]e is @xmath43 , and that for fig[fig : eikfigfive]f from the collins data set is @xmath44 and not @xmath45 ; this long standing curiosity is explained by the physics from the  [ sec : correlations ] fit .",
    "if the jet speed were constant , the residuals to @xmath6 and @xmath7 would , for the case of strictly antiparallel jets , be correlated as in fig[fig : eikfigfive]a ; to spread the distribution of points perpendicular to this line it is necessary to allow some independence in the pointing of the two jets .",
    "the variation with precessional phase of the quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is then almost as well described ( @xmath49 ) as by our fit of  [ sec : correlations ] .",
    "such a model would not be able to explain the radio jet morphology @xcite and this fit required angular fluctuations breaking symmetry to have rms values @xmath50 of those preserving symmetry .",
    "angular jitter alone can not account for the slope of @xmath51 versus @xmath52 ( fig[fig : eikfigfive ] ) differing from @xmath45 , unless the jitter in the east jet is systematically smaller than in the west jet .",
    "velocity variation breaks symmetry in the doppler shifts and accounts naturally for this observation . a better fit than either ( @xmath53 = 25.5/21 ) was achieved by allowing some symmetry breaking angular fluctuations in addition to symmetric velocity fluctuations : in this case the rms symmetry breaking fluctuations were @xmath54 of those preserving symmetry . in all cases the rms fluctuations in @xmath1 were @xmath55 of the rms fluctuations in @xmath9 , as would be expected for pointing angle fluctuations described by @xcite as `` isotropic '' .",
    "archival optical spectroscopic data on ss433 reveal variations in jet speed , in cone opening angle , and in the phase of the precession .",
    "these appear in the plane of redshift residuals ( fig[fig : eikfigfive ] ) and through the new ( symmetry dependent ) technique of combining simultaneously observed redshift pairs for the speed - only ( @xmath18 ) and angular - only ( @xmath12 ) characteristics ( fig[fig : resids_v_time ] ) .",
    "the velocity variations @xmath56 are strongly anticorrelated with cone angle @xmath1 , in the sense that when faster bolides are ejected the cone angle is smaller .",
    "we also found smaller amplitude sinusoidal oscillations in speed as a function of orbital phase .",
    "if this is due to ejection speed , perhaps the orbit of the binary is eccentric . if these 13.08-day oscillations are orbital doppler shifts the orbital velocity is @xmath57 ( twice that inferred by @xcite ) .",
    "if this were the case , the mass of the companion to ss433 would be @xmath58 and if the mass fraction were 0.1 , then the mass of the companion would be  @xmath59 .",
    "such masses would be hardly consistent with an a - type companion @xcite .",
