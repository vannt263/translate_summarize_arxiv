    "one of the attractive solutions of the hierarchy problem is the consideration of our 4-dimensional universe as a sub - manifold that is embedded in a higher dimensional space - time .",
    "the models of type add ( arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ) @xcite allow compactification radius of extra dimensions to be of macroscopic size @xcite .",
    "black holes whose horizon radius is much smaller than this characteristic length can be well described by solution for higher - dimensional static black hole @xcite .",
    "such black holes could be produced at the next - generation particle colliders , probably at energies of very low order @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus study of their properties is strongly motivated .",
    "the very important black hole characteristic is its quasi - normal ( qn ) spectrum : the set of complex frequencies ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the real parts of the qn modes are the frequency of oscillations , while the imaginary parts are their damping rates .",
    "these oscillations dominate on the intermediately late times of a perturbation evolution near a black hole .",
    "they do not depend on the initial perturbation , being defined by the black hole parameters only .    while the qn spectrum of different objects in four - dimensional @xcite and higher dimensional @xcite cases was extensively studied for massless fields of different spin and for the perturbation of the metric itself , our knowledge about the massive field qn spectrum still has gaps .",
    "massive scalar field qn modes were studied only for four - dimensional black holes within wkb approximation @xcite , and later with continued fraction method of leaver @xcite .",
    "massive vector qnms were investigated for schwarschild-(anti ) de sitter black holes @xcite .",
    "massive dirac qnms were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the behaviour of massive fields is quite different from that of the massless ones : qn spectrum of massive fields has infinitely long - living modes , called quasi - resonances @xcite .",
    "the late time behaviour of the the massive fields in black hole background is the same as in pure minkowski space - time .",
    "asymptotically late time behaviour of them does not depend on their spin , mass and multipole number @xcite .",
    "also massive fields demonstrate the so - called superradiant instability @xcite , which is absent for massless fields .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the study of the qn spectrum of the massive scalar field in a @xmath0-dimensional black hole background .",
    "note , that the scalar field is widely considered as a good model for physical fields when the effect of their spin is negligibly small .",
    "it appears also in cosmological models , and , as one of the fundamental states in string theories .",
    "the scalar field with the mass term can be also interpreted as a self - interacting scalar field within regime of small perturbations @xcite . also , the scalar field gains large effective mass when considered in models with extra dimensions of rs - type @xcite .",
    "we study the qn spectrum in this regime as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec.basic ] we present basic formulae and the method of numerical calculation of the quasi - normal modes , sec .  [ sec.numerical ] is devoted to our numerical results and their comparison with those obtained in other works .",

    "[ sec.conclusions ] we summarize the obtained results .",
    "the metric of the schwarzshild black hole in @xmath0-dimensions has the form @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 here we used the quantities @xmath8    after separation of angular and time variables , the radial part of the massive scalar field equation can be reduced to the form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the overtone number , @xmath3 is the field mass .    by definition ,",
    "the quasi - normal modes are eigenvalues of @xmath12 with the boundary conditions which correspond to the outgoing wave at spatial infinity and the ingoing wave at the black hole horizon . in 4-dimensional case @xcite",

    "the sign of @xmath15 should be chosen in order to remain in the same complex quadrant as @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that the behaviour of the wave function in a higher dimensional background differs qualitatively from that in the 4-dimensional one . for @xmath16 the leading term of @xmath17 at infinity",
    "is of order @xmath18 , that is why the appropriate boundary conditions for @xmath16 have the form : @xmath19 & r & \\simeq c_- ( r - r_0)^{-\\imo\\omega/(d-3 ) } , \\quad { \\rm as } \\quad r \\rightarrow r_h\\ , .",
    "\\label{horizonbc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one should note , that these boundary conditions do not change the possibility of quasi - resonance existing ( see @xcite ) .    to solve the equation ( [ radial ] ) , we use the continued fraction method @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ radial ] ) has an irregular singularity at spatial infinity @xmath20 and @xmath21 regular singular points : @xmath22 and the roots of the equation @xmath23 , one of them is the horizon at @xmath24 .",
    "thus the appropriate frobenius series have the following form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is regular in the circle @xmath27 for @xmath28 . for higher",
    "@xmath0 , some of the singularities appear in the unit circle and one has to continue the frobenius series through some midpoints .",
    "this technique was recently developed in @xcite , but in the present work we were limited by @xmath28 .    substituting ( [ singularity ] ) into ( [ radial ] )",
    ", one can obtain a @xmath29-term recurrence relation for the coefficients @xmath30 @xmath31 each of the functions @xmath32 has an analytical form in terms of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath12 , for a specific dimensionality @xmath0 and each integer @xmath35 .",
    "we now decrease the number of terms in the recurrence relation @xmath36 by one , i.  e.  we find the @xmath37 , which satisfy the equation @xmath38 for @xmath39 , we can rewrite the above expression as @xmath40 subtracting ( [ subsre ] ) from ( [ srcre ] ) we find the relation ( [ finre ] ) explicitly . thus we obtain : @xmath41 & & c_{j , i}^{(k)}(\\omega ) = c_{j , i}^{(k+1)}(\\omega)-\\frac{c_{k , i}^{(k+1)}(\\omega)\\ , c_{j-1,i-1}^{(k)}(\\omega)}{c_{k-1,i-1}^{(k)}(\\omega}\\ , .",

    "the complexity of the procedure is _ linear _ with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath43 .",
    "the requirement that the frobenius series be convergent at spatial infinity implies that @xmath44 which can be inverted @xmath45 times to give @xmath46 the equation ( [ invcf ] ) with _ infinite continued fraction _ on the right - hand side can be solved numerically by minimising the absolute value of the difference between the left- and right - hand sides .",
    "the equation has an infinite number of roots ( corresponding to the qn spectrum ) , but for each @xmath45 , the most stable root is different . in general",
    ", we have to use the @xmath45 times inverted equation to find the @xmath45-th qn mode . the requirement that the continued fraction be itself convergent allows us to limit its depth by some large value , always ensuring that an increase in this value does not change the final results within the desired precision .",
    "it turns out , that the convergence of the infinite continued fraction becomes worse if the imaginary part of @xmath12 increases with respect to the real part .",
    "this problem was circumvented by h .-",
    "nollert @xcite . to improve the convergence of the infinite continued fraction",
    "one can consider initial approximation for @xmath47 that for large @xmath45 can be expanded as @xmath48 since for the four - dimensional case the coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are known analytically , one can find @xmath52 from the equation @xmath53    the found expansion ( [ nollertexp ] ) could be used as an initial approximation for the `` remaining '' infinite continued fraction .",
    "in order to ensure the convergence of ( [ nollertexp ] ) for a given value of @xmath12 , one has to start from the found approximation deeply enough inside the continued fraction ( [ cfeq ] ) .",
    "it turns out , that the required depth is less than it would be if we start from some arbitrary value as the initial approximation .    as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "quasi - resonances correspond to purely imaginary @xmath15 .",
    "thus the convergence of the continued fraction decreases dramatically , and one needs to use the described method for calculation of those frequencies .",
    "even though @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are not known analytically in the case under consideration , we are still able to find the expansion ( [ nollertexp ] ) directly from ( [ rrelation ] ) . after dividing the equation ( [ rrelation ] ) by @xmath54 and using the definition of @xmath55",
    ", one can find @xmath56    the important is that the expression ( [ nollertexp ] ) should be defined without any indeterminations .",
    "since the infinite continued fraction is convergent , it is clear that @xmath57 is itself well - defined .",
    "our task is just to recover it from the equation ( [ nollerthd ] ) .",
    "it turns out that only determination of @xmath58 and @xmath59 could cause ambiguities : the first appears due to a lot of roots of the equation ( [ nollerthd ] ) and the second is connected with two possible signs of @xmath60 in ( [ nollertexp ] ) .",
    "fortunately , both ambiguities can be eliminated by using our knowledge about the properties of the series ( [ frobenius ] ) .",
    "let us consider them more precisely .    for large @xmath45 @xmath61",
    ", thus @xmath58 satisfies @xmath62 the equation ( [ c0eq ] ) has in general @xmath63 roots ( in fact there are repeated roots ) .",
    "one of the roots is _ always _",
    "@xmath64 ( it is also repeated ) , implying the unit radius of convergence of the series ( [ frobenius ] ) .",
    "other roots appear due to the existing of additional singular points of the equation ( [ radial ] ) .",
    "thus we choose @xmath64 .",
    "after fixing @xmath64 one can find that @xmath65 the sign of @xmath66 can be recovered using the convergence of the series ( [ frobenius ] ) at spatial infinity ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "therefore : @xmath68 i.  e.  @xmath69 .",
    "since for large @xmath45 @xmath70 we find out that the real part of @xmath66 can not be negative .",
    "after the sign of @xmath66 is fixed , the other coefficients in ( [ nollertexp ] ) can be found without encountering indeterminations @xcite .",
    "thus we have now possibility to use ( [ nollertexp ] ) as an initial approximation for @xmath57 when @xmath71 .",
    "this allows us to improve the convergence of the infinite continued fraction near quasi - resonances .",
    "let us start from an important notion .",
    "since the black hole mass in @xmath0-dimensional space - time can not be measured in units of length , as in four - dimensional space - time , we measure all the values in units of the black hole horizon radius that is an observable quantity . in order to do this",
    "we multiply ( [ radial ] ) by @xmath72 and consider dimensionless quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    making use of the technique described in the previous section ,",
    "we have found dependence of the quasi - normal modes on the field mass . from the figure  [ fig.l=0 ]",
    "we see that for four- and five - dimensional cases increasing of @xmath73 gives rise to decreasing of the imaginary part of the fundamental quasi - normal frequency until reaching zero , while the real part changes insignificantly .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , when some threshold value of @xmath73 is exceeded , the particular quasi - normal mode disappears .",
    "the higher threshold value corresponds to the higher overtone number .",
    "since we reached purely real frequency numerically with some finite accuracy , we can not state that purely real frequencies exist in the spectrum .",
    "we are on position , that at least while @xmath73 tends to some threshold values , the quasi - normal ringing lifetime increases infinitely .    for @xmath1",
    "we observe that the imaginary part of the fundamental mode tends to zero asymptotically while the real part approaches @xmath3 .",
    "we observed the same behaviour for different multipole numbers .",
    "for @xmath75 it is shown on the figure  [ fig.d=6 ] .",
    "the picture is similar for higher dimensional cases , but since massless field quasi - normal frequency has higher imaginary part , one needs to reach higher @xmath73 to see this tendency .",
    "even though the behaviour of the fundamental overtone is different for @xmath1 , the dependence on @xmath73 of higher overtones is qualitatively the same ( see figure  [ fig.d=6.high ] ) as for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "also because all the equations depend on @xmath78 we observe that the contribution of mass for higher overtones is of order @xmath79 as in four - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "thus the asympotical behaviour of the high overtones does not depend on @xmath3 . from the figure  [ fig.highqnms ]",
    "one can see that for 7-dimensional case the difference between massless and massive @xmath80 cases is insignificant already for 20th overtone . according to the analytical formula @xcite",
    ", the spectrum is asymptotically equidistant for all @xmath0 : @xmath81 and the real part approaches @xmath82    the difference in the mass dependence of the fundamental overtone for @xmath1 leads to another remarkable fact . since for high field mass the imaginary part of the fundamental overtone tends to zero only asymptotically ( see figure  [ fig.l=0 ] ) , and the imaginary part of higher overtones reaches zero for some finite value of @xmath73 ( see figure  [ fig.d=6 ] ) , there are some values of @xmath73 for which the imaginary parts of two overtones _ are the same_. after one of these values is reached the overtones can be distinguished only by their real part and the quasi - normal ringing has two dominant frequencies in its spectrum .",
    "it turns out that this could happen only for relatively large field mass , thus the imaginary part of those frequencies is very small : for example , for the field configuration of spherical symmetry ( @xmath83 ) in @xmath75 , the smallest value of @xmath84 , for which there are dominant modes with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "their imaginary parts are equivalently small , thus their lifetime is extremely high .",
    "thus one could observe the superposition of that two frequencies at late times of the quasi - normal ringing .",
    "one should note that this exotic behaviour was found for relatively large field mass for which the linear approximation ( i.  e.  without taking into consideration the back reaction of the field upon the black hole ) could not be good .",
    "the fundamental modes of massless scalar field for different @xmath0 are presented in table  [ fundamentalmodes ] .",
    "we see that as @xmath0 increases , the real part of the fundamental overtone increases faster than the imaginary part .",
    "thus fields that live in the bulk are better oscillators than brane - localised ones @xcite , considered in the context of large extra dimension scenario ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    ".fundamental quasi - normal frequencies of massless scalar field ( measured in the units of the black hole horizon radius ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we checked the correctness of our results by comparing them with those @xcite obtained with the help of the wkb method @xcite for higher values of the multipole number .",
    "the wkb method is known to give very accurate results in this regime @xcite .",
    "one should note also , that massless scalar field quasi - normal spectrum coincides with that of the metric perturbation of the tensor type for @xmath87 , which was recently studied @xcite .",
    "our results were obtained independently and demonstrate complete agreement .",
    "in the present paper we studied quasi - normal spectrum of the massive scalar field near the higher dimensional black hole within continued fraction method of leaver with improvement of nollert that was generalised for the case of @xmath43-term recurrence relation for frobenius series coefficients .",
    "we found that the fundamental modes for @xmath1 have qualitatively different dependence on the field mass : their real part approaches the field mass while the imaginary part tends to zero for high values of @xmath73 . at the same time , the behaviour of higher modes is qualitatively the same as for @xmath76 and @xmath77 cases : the imaginary part decreases quickly and the particular mode disappears after reaching some threshold value of @xmath73 .",
