    "like most millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , psrj16142230   is in a binary system .",
    "the circular orbit is consistent with the pulsar having undergone mass transfer and spun up .",
    "the mass function derived from pulsar timing indicated a companion with mass @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the system recently came into prominence when @xcite reported the mass of the pulsar to be @xmath5@xmath0 .",
    "the detection of such a massive neutron star ( ns ) places very strong constraints on the equation of state of matter at extreme nuclear densities ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rather exquisite precision of this mass measurement was possible due to the orbit being almost perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "as a result , the shapiro delay caused by the companion is very large , resulting in a precise estimate of the mass of the companion , @xmath6 .",
    "the 8.7day orbital period is significantly shorter than @xmath7days expected for a low - mass x - ray binary with such a massive secondary @xcite  suggesting a peculiar evolutionary history for this binary .",
    "given the importance of the result of @xcite additional verification or consistency checks of physical parameters of psrj16142230can be expected to be of some value . a 0.5@xmath0  white dwarf ( wd ) at the inferred distance of psrj16142230  ( @xmath8kpc ) , even if a few gyr old , is within the reach of present - day optical telescopes .",
    "it is this search for the wd that constitutes the principal focus of this letter .",
    "we observed psrj16142230   ( figure [ fig : detect ] ) in @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands using the imaging mode of the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the 10 m keck - i telescope  @xcite , with upgraded red and blue cameras  @xcite .",
    "several images were acquired at each target location , dithering the telescope by small amounts between each exposure . the observing conditions on ut 2010 may 15 were poor ( seeing 1.4 ) , so only data acquired on ut 2010 july 8 ( @xmath10 band seeing 0.85 fwhm ) were used in this analysis .",

    "the calibration field was observed immediately after the science exposures , and had airmass 1.4 as compared to 1.6 for the target .",

    "we do not detect anything within 1  of the target in the @xmath9 band .",
    "the optical coordinates of this source , the timing position of the pulsar and a proposed x - ray counterpart are summarized in table [ tab : radec ] . to compare this with the source location",
    ", we first have to correct for the 33masyr@xmath11 proper motion of the source .",
    "the lris source p is about 0.50 south of the pulsar position ( extrapolated for the epoch of lris observations ) .",
    "given the 0.24 ( 1-@xmath23 ) astrometric uncertainty of the optical images , this position is consistent with the location of the pulsar .",
    "the density of objects brighter than star p in this field is 0.02arcsecond@xmath24 . using the 0.85 seeing fwhm as the mean diameter of stars , we calculate a false identification probability of @xmath25 .",
    "the excellent astrometric coincidence and the low probability of chance coincidence embolden us to suggest that star p is the optical counterpart of psrj16142230 .",
    "counterpart p is located only 4.2 from the 16.3 mag star , and is contaminated by the flux in the wings of its point - spread function .",
    "the proximity to this bright source will bias both the photometry and the astrometry of the counterpart . to calculate the bias",
    ", we injected fake gaussian sources with fwhm matched to the seeing and brightness comparable to the faint object .",
    "we then measured the coordinates and magnitude of the injected source using the same procedure as for the faint object .",
    "we find that for separations @xmath26.2 , the recovered position is systematically pulled towards the bright star by 0.1  0.2 .",
    "this is small enough that we do not apply this correction .",

    "this implies that the pulsar is behind approximately one third of the galactic absorbing column .",

    "* ) to get @xmath31 .",

    "the extinction - corrected @xmath10-band absolute magnitude is @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , they place a lower limit of 900pc on the distance , using pulsar parallax from timing measurements .",
    "the corresponding absolute magnitude is @xmath37 .",
    "the measured mass ( 0.5@xmath0 ) and the inferred absolute magnitude ( @xmath38 ) when applied to wd cooling models  @xcite lead to an age of @xmath39gyr .",
    "for such a wd , the expected absolute magnitude in other bands is @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this gives @xmath42 , consistent with our non detection .",
    "as per the standard evolutionary model for msps , the ns in psrj16142230  was spun up by accretion from a low- or intermediate - mass companion star .",
    "the accretion stopped when the companion decoupled from its roche lobe and became a wd . at this point ,",
    "the msp started spinning down by radiating energy .",
    "the spin - down age of the msp is thus equal to the cooling down age of the wd .",
    "the measured period derivative of a pulsar ( @xmath51 ) is always higher than its true period derivative ( @xmath46 ) owing to transverse motion  @xcite .",

    "@xcite for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the location of psrj16142230  on this plot depends on the distance ( see section  [ sec : age ] ) .",
    "were the pulsar to be at 900pc , it would be born at the star symbol and evolve toward its present - day location , the hollow circle marked `` e '' . if instead it is at 1200pc , the birth location is shown by the upward triangle , which also coincides with its present - day location .",
    "the solid curve passing through the star and the upward triangle denotes all possible birth locations for psrj16142230 .",
    "the system evolves through the shaded gray area to its present - day location on the vertical line through e and the upward triangle . ]",
    "the dm inferred distance is quite uncertain , so it is useful to consider the dependence of all parameters on distance .",
    "figure [ fig : dist ] shows the range of values for the @xmath10-band absolute magnitude ( @xmath62 ) , the wd cooling age ( @xmath63 ) , the intrinsic period derivative in the pulsar s frame ( @xmath46 ) and the initial spin period ( @xmath43 ) . since there is no energy injection to the pulsar now , it must be currently spinning down .",
    "this implies @xmath64 and allows us to calculate an upper limit on the distance to the pulsar : @xmath65pc ( 1-@xmath23 ) .",
    "the last panel in figure [ fig : dist ] shows @xmath66ms .",
    "we conclude that the pulsar in psrj16142230  must have been born with a period close to the current observed value .",
    "the birth spin period of a ns is governed by an equilibrium between the ram pressure of the accreting material and the magnetic field .",
    "nss spun up by accretion at the eddington rate ( @xmath67 ) are reborn as msps on the `` rebirth line ''  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ppdot ] shows this rebirth line on a @xmath45@xmath46 diagram , along with current positions of various pulsars from the atnf database  @xcite . also shown",
    "are rebirth lines for pulsars accreting at @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for a pulsar radiating as a dipole ,",
    "the @xmath70 product remains constant through its lifetime .",
    "thus , we can calculate the initial spin - down rate of the pulsar : @xmath71 , where @xmath43 comes from equation ( [ eq : pinit ] ) .",
    "if psrj16142230  is at 900pc , then it would have been born with @xmath72 and @xmath73ms .",
    "this value is indicated with a star .",
    "the pulsar then evolves toward the lower right , to the circle marked `` e '' .",
    "similarly , the birth parameters for the pulsar assuming @xmath56kpc are shown by the upward triangle  it is nearly coincident with the current parameters of the pulsar for this distance .",
    "other possible birth locations for the pulsar lie along the solid line passing through the star and triangle .",
    "the gray region shows all possible positions that psrj16142230  can have occupied in its lifetime .",
    "it is clear that the pulsar was born well below the rebirth line , and the mean accretion rate during the spin - up phase ( the final major accretion phase ) was lower than @xmath69 .",
    "two groups have run detailed simulations of the evolution of psrj16142230 .",
    "the @xcite model and the preferred model of @xcite are qualitatively similar : the system begins as an intermediate mass x - ray binary consisting of a ns and a @xmath74@xmath0  main - sequence secondary , which evolves to form a co wd with an he envelope .",
    "the secondary accretes mass onto the ns in three phases .",
    "the first phase ( a1 ) is a thermal timescale mass transfer at super - eddington accretion rates , where the ns gains little mass .",
    "the next phase ( a2 ) is on a nuclear timescale ( @xmath75myr ) , when the secondary is burning h in the core and envelope . during this phase ,",
    "the accretion rates are upto about a tenth of the eddington limit . during the final accretion phase ( phase ab ) , the secondary is burning he in its core and h in an envelope .",
    "this causes the radius of the donor star to expand , triggering accretion at near - eddington rates for 5  10myr .",
    "the ns gains the most mass during this phase . for typical ns parameters , accreting 0.1 ",
    "0.2@xmath0  is enough to spin them up millisecond periods  @xcite .",
    "hence , the near - eddington accretion in phase ab should spin the pulsar up all the way to the rebirth line .",
    "this is inconsistent with our inferred birth position of psrj16142230 .",
    "if the stellar evolution models are correct , then there is a problem with the standard formation scenario of msps  @xcite .",
    "in essence , the birth period depends on factors other than the magnetic field strength and accretion rates .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposes that accretion induces a quadrupole moment @xmath76 in the ns .",
    "the ns then loses angular momentum by gravitational wave radiation .",
    "since the magnetic fields do not play any significant role in this model , the rebirth line becomes irrelevant , and psrj16142230  may start its life anywhere on the @xmath45@xmath46 diagram . in summary ,",
    "the birth of psrj16142230  away from the rebirth line requires reconsideration of angular momentum loss mechanisms .",
    "going forward , on - going radio observations ( pulsar timing and vlbi ) should improve the parallax and thereby decrease the uncertainty in the inferred @xmath77 and thus better locate the pulsar in the @xmath45-@xmath77 diagram .",
    "the scattered light from light q , while bothersome to the present observations , provide an opportunity to use adaptive optics to measure the near - ir fluxes of the wd .",
    "grism spectroscopy with",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ can potentially reveal the presumed h+he layer posited by stellar evolutionary models of @xcite .",
