    "the current metallicity of the galactic disk represents a fossil record of chemical enrichment since the birth of the milky way and during its subsequent evolution . as stars continually enrich the interstellar medium with their nucleosynthetic products , the metallicity of the disk increases over time . by investigating the relative abundance of chemical elements as a function of time and position within the galaxy , it is possible to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "much work has been done on tracking the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood as a function of time using age - metallicity relations and element abundance ratios in cool f and g - type stars .",
    "the seminal work by edvardsson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed the potential of using samples of nearby stars with an age spread to trace the temporal evolution of the disk and the halo , and such work has been extended by , for example , fuhrmann ( @xcite ) and israelian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these types of metallicity ratios have been modelled by many authors ( e.g. carraro et al .",
    "1998 , pilyugin & edmunds 1996 and references therein ) , in order to constrain our galaxy s history .",
    "the photospheric abundances of massive stars ( viz .",
    "stars with zams @xmath2 10 m@xmath3 ) do not have the potential to provide us with temporal information as they are by nature short - lived objects ( with typical lifetimes of the order of @xmath410 - 50myrs )",
    ". however , their high intrinsic luminosities mean that we can spectroscopically observe them at large distances from the solar neighbourhood ; ob - type main - sequence stars are typically 8@xmath5 visually brighter than early g - type dwarfs .",
    "their photospheres are representative of the interstellar material from which they were born due to their relative youth .",
    "hence , we can spatially and radially sample the metallicity of the galactic disk by determining abundances in distant , luminous blue stars .",
    "the radial variation of different elements provides a further key constraint on the formation and evolutionary mechanisms of the galactic disk ( matteucci & francois @xcite , matteucci & chiappini @xcite , prantzos &  aubert @xcite , portinari & chiosi @xcite , pagel & tautvaiin @xcite ) .",
    "these models require further observational constraints to restrict the possible influence of their many free parameters such as initial mass function , gas fraction variations , star formation rates , infall and outflow rates and metallicity dependent stellar yields .",
    "previous work has shown that the metallicity of the galactic disk decreases as galactocentric distance increases .",
    "this metallicity gradient has been reproduced quantitatively using a number of different methods .",
    "for example , extensive studies of optical emission lines in hii regions by shaver et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and fich & silkey ( @xcite ) have derived an oxygen abundance gradient of @xmath6dexkpc@xmath7 ; within the region @xmath8kpc ( where @xmath9 refers to galactocentric distance throughout this paper ) .",
    "good agreement was also found by maciel & kppen ( @xcite ) and maciel & quireza ( @xcite ) from pn studies , and by afflerbach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in a study of ultra - compact hii regions .",
    "several studies of b - type main - sequence stars throughout the disk had given discrepant results , and a much shallower gradient than that derived from the nebular studies ( e.g fitzsimmons et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however smartt & rolleston ( @xcite ) , in a consistent re - analysis of an extensive data - set of b - type stars covering @xmath10kpc , showed that previous b - type star studies produced spurious gradient determinations , and derived an oxygen abundance gradient of @xmath6dexkpc@xmath7 in excellent agreement with the nebular studies .",
    "as a follow up to this , rolleston et al .",
    "( @xcite ; hereafter rsdr ) carried out a more detailed and exhaustive survey of the large data - set gathered by the group at queen s university and have confirmed this result , while also producing abundance ratios of different elements along the disk .",
    "further work by gummersbach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) also indicates that the nebular and stellar results are in agreement within the errors of measurement .",
    "however , most studies of the chemical composition of the galactic disk have concentrated on the solar neighbourhood , and the anti - centre direction .",
    "optical extinction rises steeply in the direction toward the galactic centre , and restricts the optical observation of disk stars more than a few kiloparsecs away . in the anti - centre direction we have previously probed out to @xmath1118kpc , experiencing a@xmath123 ( smartt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but have only managed to observe open clusters towards the centre approximately 2@xmath13kpc away ( rsdr ) with a reddening of a@xmath122 .",
    "the metallicity within the solar galactic radius is poorly sampled , with only a few ir studies available .",
    "rudolph et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and afflerbach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have used similar observational methods for far - ir emission lines in hii regions ( of differing sizes ) as ism abundance probes .",
    "this far - ir technique has allowed observation of some inner galactic regions .",
    "these studies suggest that the abundance gradients for both nitrogen and sulphur do tend to increase towards the galactic centre , but both indicate that their oxygen abundance derivations may suffer some uncertainties ( see section[discussion_i ] ) .",
    "carr et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have achieved a first determination of stellar abundances ( in an m - type supergiant ) directly at the galactic centre in the spectacular star forming region within the central few hundred parsecs .",
    "they find an fe abundance close to that of the solar neighbourhood , which at first may seems surprising given the wealth of evidence of a strong abundance gradient in the milky way ( and also in other spirals ) .",
    "however as we discuss in section[dist_discuss ] , this region may be unrelated to the starforming galactic disk ( @xmath13kpc ) as a whole , and its evolution may have proceeded independently .",
    "the metallicity of the inner disk therefore has not been investigated in any great detail , and lacks information on a variety of elemental abundances .",
    "spectra of b - type stars provide the potential to sample many more chemical elements than is possible through emission line studies . as discussed above ,",
    "massive b - type main - sequence stars are excellent probes of the current interstellar medium and sample particularly well the @xmath14-processed elements ( o , mg , and si ) as well as c and n ( smartt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this paper describes observations of metal - rich massive stars lying towards the galactic centre together with detailed model atmosphere and abundance analyses .",
    "this allows the comparison of abundance ratios in this interesting regime with those in the rest of the disk , as a key probe of the evolution of our galaxy .",
    "the main difficulty in optically probing the inner regions of the galactic disk is of course the high extinction encountered .",
    "this section describes how we identified targets for optical photometry and spectroscopy which are in regions of low extinction , but which have probably originated in the inner disk region .",
    "the catalogue of reed ( @xcite ) provides a database of published ubv@xmath15 photoelectric photometry for objects in the stephenson and sanduleak catalogue _ luminous stars in the southern milky way _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "this catalogue is a fairly complete record of ob - type stars and a- & f - type supergiants and giants within 10@xmath16 of the galactic plane and with longitude limits @xmath17 , down to a limiting photographic magnitude of approximately 12.5 . in order to identify ob - type stars near the galactic centre , which also have moderate galactic latitudes and hence suffer from low extinction , stars from the reed catalogue were selected which satisfied all of the criteria listed below:    1 .",
    "stars within @xmath18 ; hence restricting the sample to objects towards the galactic centre .",
    "stars which are more than 4@xmath16 above or below the plane ; in order to limit the effects of interstellar extinction .",
    "stars which are fainter than v = 11.0 , to sample the more distant objects .",
    "stars with a colour factor between @xmath10.90 @xmath19 q @xmath19 @xmath10.66 ; appropriate for early b - type stars ; + .",
    "stars with a b  v of less than 0.5 @xmath1 which implies a reddening of @xmath20 ( for early b - type intrinsic colours ) .    the combination of these criteria should produce targets which are potentially normal early b - type dwarfs ( or _ near _ main - sequence objects ) lying within @xmath44kpc of the galactic centre and twelve such stars were found .",
    "the database of reed & beatty ( @xcite ) contains published spectral types for a subset of the objects in reed ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the fainter objects of the earlier study ( which were the most promising distant b - type stellar candidates ) did not have an entry in reed & beatty ( 1995 ) . as a result we had to rely on colours as a primary selector .",
    "the spectroscopic data presented in this paper were taken on two different runs .",
    "all twelve candidates were observed at the anglo - australian telescope in august 1994 at intermediate resolution .",
    "the rgo spectrograph along with the 1200b diffraction grating , 82 cm camera and the tek1k ccd were used to give a resolution of approximately 0.7   ( fwhm ) .",
    "two grating positions were employed with central wavelengths of 4020   and 4580 , each giving a wavelength coverage of 240 .",
    "the primary motivation of these observations was to identify normal stars for further , higher resolution observations at a higher signal - to - noise ratio , and to provide reliable hi profiles for the stars which did turn out to be normal .",
    "six of the stars observed appeared to be normal main - sequence early - type b - stars .",
    "however one of these was a fast rotator with a lack of metal line features , while another appeared to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( composed of two early - type components ) with the metal lines severely blended .",
    "the nature of the other six peculiar stars is discussed in venn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the four apparently normal stars ( see table  [ photometry_tab1 ] ) were further observed with the eso 3.6 m telescope using the caspec chelle spectrograph during july 1995 .",

    "our estimated spectral types are quoted [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to constrain the regions of the disk where these stars were formed , we follow the arguments of smartt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for each of the stellar spectra",
    "we have determined a radial velocity , and we compare this velocity to that expected if the stars were co - rotating with the disk at their current projected positions ( assuming a flat rotation curve and r@xmath3 = 8.5kpc , @xmath21 km s@xmath7  from kerr & lynden - bell @xcite ) . we calculate a peculiar radial velocity ( prv ) which is the difference between these two , as a representative measure of the dynamics of the stars with respect to the galaxy rotation .",
    "this prv is only one component of the total peculiar space velocity , with the other two components unknown ( directed along axes mutually perpendicular to the prv ) .",
    "we assume that the second component of velocity is perpendicular to the galactic plane ( which , given the small galactic latitudes of these stars is a reasonable assumption ) .",
    "house & kilkenny ( @xcite ) have given an expression for the force field normal to the galactic plane ( @xmath22 ) , but this is probably only valid for @xmath23kpc .",
    "given that these stars have origins closer to the galactic centre , we have assumed a simple relation which is an approximation to the shape of the house & kilkenny form of @xmath22 , but which is always greater in magnitude ( with a peak of twice the house & kilkenny maximum ) .",
    "we assume that within @xmath24pc the force field @xmath22 is approximated by @xmath25 ( with @xmath26cms@xmath27pc@xmath7 ) and for @xmath28pc then @xmath29 .",
    "analytical expressions for the initial velocity ( v@xmath30 ) and time required for the stars to reach their present @xmath31 distance , could then be deduced .",
    "the initial ejection velocity perpendicular to the galactic plane needs to be no more than 100 km s@xmath7  ( see table[distance_data ] ) for these stars to reach their present positions , and significantly less for three of the objects .",
    "velocities of this order are well within those plausible for common ejection methods ( leonard @xcite ) .",
    "the prv of each star is also relatively low , indicating that the initial space velocities of these stars were probably directed mostly in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "however without proper motion information we can not definitively constrain their space velocity . if we assume that the mean ejection velocity in the sample ( v@xmath32 60 km s@xmath7  ) is indicative of the maximum value of any one velocity component",
    ", then we can calculate a circular locus within which the star probably formed . in 20myrs , a star could have moved 1.7kpc within ( or parallel to ) the galactic disk , and this is a reasonable error on the birth sites of the stars .",
    "[ galactic_pos ]    figure  [ galactic_pos ] illustrates the estimated stellar birth sites and also schematically draws attention to features of galactic structure in this region .",
    "bertelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have discussed the possibility that a ` stellar ring ' exists , which surrounds the galactic centre at a distance of 3.5kpc , with a 0.5kpc half - width .",
    "the nature of this ring is still somewhat uncertain , but bertelli et al .",
    "claim that assuming it to be a region of increased stellar disk density would produce synthetic colour - magnitude diagrams closely matching those they have observed in fields towards the galactic centre .",
    "they suggest that it is associated with active star formation , and that the cross - section through this ring is at a maximum when viewed at @xmath33 .",
    "they further suggest that this is consistent with an observed peak in oh maser sources ( blommaert et al .",
    "@xcite ) around @xmath34 , a signature of relatively recent star formation . whether this is a complete ring surrounding the inner galaxy , or part of an inner spiral arm , is still debatable ( ortiz & lpine @xcite ) .",
    "clemens et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have mapped the distribution of molecular gas in the first quadrant of the galaxy , and found an h@xmath35 ring at approximately 4kpc from the centre .",
    "this would appear to correlate with the stellar ring found by bertelli et al .",
    ", but the latter suggest that the stellar and molecular ring are not necessarily co - incident . rather that the molecular ring maybe the result of a `` bow - shock of propagating star formation '' .",
    "although some galaxy models ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ; bahcall 1986 ) adopt a relation for the number density of disk stars which falls off exponentially with increasing distance from the galactic centre , it appears that at r@xmath362.5kpc from the galactic centre there is a sharp decrease in the stellar disk density ( bertelli et al 1995 , paczynski et al .",
    "this has been interpreted as the transition between the disk and the bulge .",
    "figure  [ galactic_pos ] suggests that the four b - type stars have their origins in this stellar ring , or where the molecular ring dynamics are causing current star formation . indeed",
    "if there is a disk / bulge transition , early - type stars may be relatively rare within this inner region , although current and spectacular star formation is certainly on - going in the inner few hundred parsecs ( serabyn et al .",
    "1998 ; najarro et al .",
    "the above indicates that our b - type stars probably formed around r@xmath373.5kpc in the galactic disk and were subsequently ejected .",
    "carr et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have presented ir spectra of a red m - type supergiant ( irs7 ) lying in the central cluster , and compared the metal line spectra with that of a similar star in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "a differential abundance analysis of the star indicates that it has an fe abundance very close to solar , and certainly does not appear metal enhanced in any significant way ( although it does appear to show cno - abundances typical of severe dredge - up after core h - burning ) . at first this may seem a surprising result given that one might expect a linear galactic abundance gradient in the thin disk to keep rising towards the centre , and that the central regions would thus show super - metal rich abundances .",
    "however there is lack of molecular gas , young stars and hii regions within the inner 3.5kpc , until one gets to the central cluster .",
    "hence , whatever the evolutionary history of the massive stellar clusters at the centre , it seems to have occurred independently of the milky way disk ( @xmath38kpc ) .",
    "there is no reason therefore too assume that the disk and central cluster are chemically linked , and one should consider them as separate entities in evolutionary scenarios .",
    "as discussed in sections[ls5130_dis][ls5127_dis ] , all four stars have relatively normal oxygen abundances . if the oxygen abundance gradients derived in the solar neighbourhood and outer disk are extrapolated inwards ( smartt & rolleston 1997 , rsdr ; @xmath10.07 dexkpc@xmath7 ) their o abundances would be 0.3@xmath10.4dex above the solar neighbourhood value .",
    "ls5130 and ls4419 show no evidence at all of oxygen - rich photospheres , and both sample the oii line spectra extremely well , with 43 and 28 features measured respectively .",
    "if the statistical errors are normally distributed around the mean , then the random error in our mean differential abundance ( @xmath39 ; where @xmath40 is the standard deviation quoted in tables[ls5130_abundances ] and [ ls4419_abundances ] ) may be as small as @xmath410.04 for both these stars .",
    "furthermore , a systematic error in the atmospheric parameters significantly greater than that quoted in table[typical_errors ] would be required to make these stars o - rich which would have major consequences for the other elements and for the continuum fitting of the @xmath0 indices .",
    "the large number of oii lines well observed in these stars and the possible error sources in table[typical_errors ] make this a robust result .",
    "the other two stars ls4784 and ls5127 show marginal evidence for oxygen abundances higher than their comparison stars , with standard errors of the mean @xmath410.1dex .",
    "however again these results appear to be incompatible with an o abundance that is 0.3@xmath10.4dex above solar .",
    "a number of previous authors have speculated that the oxygen abundance gradient ( in particular ) may steepen towards the centre ( vlchez & esteban @xcite , shaver et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , we can find no evidence that this is the case .",
    "figure[osimg_gradients ] shows the oxygen abundances of our stars together with those of the large galactic b - star sample of rsdr .",
    "the low metallicity stars in the outer galaxy ( @xmath42kpc ) are clearly evident , but between 6@xmath19kpc there is little evidence of o abundance variations .",
    "the four new stellar points toward the centre accentuate this relation , and it would appear that the o abundance gradient in the galaxy flattens off at around 9kpc and does not significantly increase at smaller galactocentric distances .",
    "afflerbach et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have carried out an extensive study of the n , s and o abundances in hii regions with @xmath43kpc . in fig.[on_hii_comp ] , their o abundances are plotted together with those for our stars and the stellar sample of rsdr with @xmath43kpc .",
    "the results from the hii regions and the rsdr data - set in the outer galaxy are in excellent agreement ( see rsdr and smartt @xcite for further details ) .",
    "however differences appear at smaller galactocentric distances .",
    "in particular while the hii region data is consistent with a linear gradient @xmath10.06dexkpc@xmath7 , no significant variations are apparant for the b - stars .",
    "one possible explanation is that the zero - points for the two studies is somewhat different .",
    "for example , if the afflerbach et al .",
    "data were shifted upwards by @xmath40.2dex ( the difference in the mean results within @xmath44kpc ) , then good agreement would be found within the solar neighbourhood , but the b - stars towards the centre would not reflect the hii region results . the cause of this discrepancy is unclear and appears to be limited to oxygen ( see sect .",
    "[ discussion_ii ] and [ discussion_iii ] ) .",
    "we note that afflerbach et al .",
    "is the only hii region study of the inner galaxy to quote oxygen abundances .",

    "( 1997 ) were unable to independently determine s and o , while shaver et al .",

    "additionally , on average there seems to be a 50% discrepancy in the sulphur abundances .",

    "smartt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have discussed the problem of determining reliable absolute nebular abundances in regions of solar abundance and above in m31 , and find significant discrepancies across different analysis methods .    in terms of effective radius ( where @xmath45kpc , from de vaucouleurs & pence @xcite ) , the break in the observed o abundance gradient occurs at @xmath46 .",
    "the spiral galaxy ngc2403 has been studied by garnett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who estimated hii region abundances at 12 points across the disk . in fig[mw_ngc2403_grads ] the oxygen abundance is plotted as a function of effective radius for both these galaxies .",
    "a similar gradient change may be present in ngc2403 , although the sampling is relatively sparse .",

    "hence the absolute results of the galactic centre stars are on a consistent scale to the rest of the data .",
    "however with mg , the abundance derived in @xmath48  peg and @xmath49  her is 7.2dex , whereas in rsdr the mean local value is 7.85 dex ( again estimated from the mean of stellar values within 1kpc of the sun ) .",
    "the stars analysed in this paper have effective temperatures in the range @xmath50k , while the rsdr sample have a mean temperature of 25275k and it is possible that the modelling of this line is temperature dependent .",
    "it is important to use homogeneous datasets when looking for abundance trends and that is indeed what was done in rsdr .",
    "they showed that although the zero - point of any particular abundance may be in the error , any gradient biasing is removed by using suitable sub - samples of stars . hence to put the four galactic centre stars onto the same scale as rsdr , we have added 7.85dex to their _ differential _ mg abundances .",
    "this assumes that @xmath48  peg , @xmath49  her and the stars within 1kpc of the sun in rsdr have similar abundances and that any offset is due to temperature dependent modelling inaccuracies .",
    "it appears that the galactic centre stars are richer in mg than their local counterparts ( see also sect[ls5127_mgii_line ] ) . from table[typical_errors ] an underestimate of the microturbulence ( @xmath51 ) in each star could reduce this mg overabundance as it is based on a relatively strong line .",
    "however an increase in @xmath51 by 5 km s@xmath7  or more in each star would be required .",

    "sulphur abundances for our stars are also available , although we have no similar data at greater radii from rsdr . in fig[fig_sal_grads ] our stellar abundances are compared with with those from afflerbach et al .",
    "reasonable agreement is found with these stars appearing to be s - rich and having abundances similar to those found in nebular studies towards the centre ( although the caveat regarding the nebular absolute values discussed in the previous section may be important ) .",
    "the correlation of of o , mg , and si abundances found in the outer galaxy ( see rsdr ) and in the low metallicity magellanic clouds ( rolleston et al .",
    "@xcite ) is theoretically expected as these elements are all produced and returned to the ism through supernovae typeii .",
    "one would expect that this trend should continue towards the inner galaxy , and it is surprising that our o abundances show no sign of increase , while mg and si appear significantly higher than their comparison stars .",
    "the s abundances in these stars are also higher than normal , although the dataset is somewhat less robust given the weakness of the absorption features of this element .",
    "prantzos et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have investigated the effect of metallicity dependent yields ( taken from the model calculations of maeder @xcite ) on the galactic chemical evolution of c and o and concluded that oxygen yields from massive stars tend to decrease towards higher metallicities .",
    "this is due to mass loss in low metallicity stars , resulting in most of the star s mass being retained up until the final explosion . however , at high metallicities significantly more mass is ejected in the stellar wind ( which is rich in helium and carbon ) , and leaves a smaller mass fraction which can be converted into oxygen .",
    "the relatively high carbon and low oxygen abundances derived here are in qualitative agreement with the situation predicted by these models .",
    "a full study of the evolution of elements heavier than oxygen has not been undertaken using metallicity dependent yields .",
    "however maeder ( 1992 ) has discussed how the combined yield of `` heavy elements '' ( defined as ne , mg , si , s , ca & fe ) from massive stars varies with original metal composition .",
    "interestingly , he finds that the `` heavy element '' contributions of the stellar models at high metallicity ( @xmath55 ) are not as low as is the case for oxygen .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that chemical yields are dependent on the conditions for black hole formation since the final yield of a pre - supernova massive star ( pictured in the conventional onion - skin model ) depends on what fraction of the stellar layers are retained during core collapse .",
    "the observational findings presented here should provide a stimulus to investigations of the evolution of the galaxy at high metallicities , given the probability that stellar yields are highly variable with metallicity , and dependent on the limits of black hole formation .",
    "furthermore , we should attempt to determine the true quantitative variation in the ratios of the @xmath14-elements in the inner galaxy to investigate if this trend is real . the recent chemical evolution models of portinari & chiosi ( @xcite , @xcite ) do indicate that the o abundance gradient may indeed flatten off in the region @xmath56kpc , which is encouraging .",
    "however their sn typeii yields would suggest that the other @xmath14-processed elements ( mg and si ) should follow a similar trend , which we do not observe .",
    "boissier & prantzos ( @xcite ) also suggest that their evolutionary models for the milky way predict a flattening of the metallicity gradient with time , and that saturation is reached in the inner galaxy .",
    "this is in reasonable quantitative agreement with what we find for oxygen abundances , but does not explain the behaviour of the other elements .",
    "each of the four stars do appear to have nitrogen abundances significantly higher than their solar neighbourhood counterparts .",
    "the result for ls5130 is more marginal than the others , but with 19 features measured an error in the mean ( @xmath57 ) of 0.03dex would suggest that the enrichment is real although small .",
    "figure4(b ) shows the nitrogen abundances of the galactic centre stars plotted along with a sample of stars from rsdr , and the hii regions from afflerbach et al .",
    "the gradient found in rsdr appears to continue towards the centre ; certainly the abundance estimates do not appear to flatten as for oxygen .",
    "reasonably good agreement with the absolute values of the hii region analyses is found , and we calculate quite a significant gradient for @xmath58n / o . the full sample of rsdr yielded a gradient in n / o of @xmath59dexkpc@xmath7 , and this is increased slightly by the inclusion of the four galactic centre stars .",
    "the latter effect is clearly due to the stars showing enhanced nitrogen in their atmospheres , but normal oxygen .",
    "we have previously discussed the possibility of n - rich core gas contaminating the surface of young massive stars , and hence polluting the natal photospheric material ( rsdr ) .",
    "however due to the lack of a strong anti - correlation of c and n , rsdr found no evidence for such contamination and the same argument holds for the four stars analysed here .",
    "an explanation of the n / o gradient was discussed in rsdr , based on the original ideas of vila - costas & edmunds ( @xcite ) . at metallicities higher than @xmath60 o / h @xmath48.3 , @xmath58",
    "n / o would be proportional to @xmath58 o / h , because n enrichment would be dominated by secondary production , i.e. from c and o seed nuclei in the natal interstellar material through the cno - cycle . primary production would play a minimal role in contributing to the ism abundance of n , and simple closed - box models in which the production of n is dominated by secondary production do predict a linear trend . at low metallicities",
    "the secondary component becomes less important ( due to its inherent dependence on metallicity ) , and the dominant mechanism for the production of nitrogen is primary .",
    "the metallicity at which this happens is around 8.3dex , close to the value found in the outer most regions of the galactic disk .",
    "these ideas stem from the fact that the n / o ratios in low metallicity dwarf galaxies show a very large scatter , with little discernable trend . as primary nitrogen orginates in low - intermediate mass stars",
    "there is a time delay between is enrichment and that of primary oxygen ( from short - lived massive stars ) , hence the scatter at low metallicitities is often interpreted as time dependent delays between oxygen and nitrogen enrichments .",
    "however at the high metallicities we are dealing with , it is likely that secondary production ( in massive stars is dominant ) , and there would thus be no delay between n and o production .",
    "our n / o ratios toward the galactic centre tend to support the conclusions of rsdr that the n / o gradient in the galaxy is real , and due to secondary n production dominating across the disk .    in fig.[fig_co_grads ]",
    "carbon abundances for the four galactic centre stars and from the rsdr compilation are plotted .",
    "as three of our new points are c - rich , it is not surprising that the abundances appears to steadily increase toward the centre . as discussed for nitrogen , because the stars are not rich in oxygen the c / o ratio is greater than normal , hence producing a larger ( and statistically more significant ) gradient than that given in rsdr .",
    "as discussed by maeder ( 1992 ) this would be consistent with c being produced at a greater rate than o in metal - rich stars ( section[discussion_ii ] ) , due to the increased mass - loss in the post he - burning phase .",
    "the analysis of high - quality data for four blue stars lying towards the galactic centre , and a comparison with young stars throughout the galactic disk , leads to the following conclusions    1 .",
    "the four stars appear to be normal , young , massive , early b - type stars .",
    "they lie slightly out of the galactic plane and their calculated distances indicate that they are at distances from the disk of @xmath61kpc .",
    "a kinematic analysis indicates that they were probably born in the disk within @xmath62kpc of the galactic centre and then subsequently ejected .",
    "comparison with galactic structure models suggests they may have originated in the stellar or molecular ring at @xmath63kpc .",
    "2 .   a differential line - by - line abundance analysis of the four stars with two bright stars near",
    "the sun indicates a surprising abundance pattern : * two of the stars ( ls5130 and ls4419 ) have oxygen abundances very similar to stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the other two ( ls4784 and ls5130 ) show only marginal evidence for enhanced oxygen . in all cases",
    "any enhancement is significantly below the @xmath64dex that would be expected given the galactic position of the stars and the gradient from rsdr .",
    "oxygen is a very reliably determined abundance in these particular types of stars . * the relatively well measured abundances of si , al , mg and s however",
    "do indicate that these stars have enhanced abundances in most other elements .",
    "however , the physical cause of the natal gas having a `` normal '' oxygen content and enriched @xmath14-processed elements is unclear .",
    "the si and mg abundances are consistent with the continuation of the linear gradient derived by rsdr for stars in the solar neighbourhood and the outer galaxy .",
    "* the four stars also appear rich in both c and n , again in agreement with a continuation of the rsdr gradients towards the centre .",
    "* we discuss the possible errors in our analysis , and conclude that it is unlikely that these stars have higher oxygen abundances than those typically found in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "it is also very likely they are rich in all the other elements studied ( c , n , mg , si , s , al ) although the physical pocesses that produces such a pattern is unclear .",
    "* appendix a : table9 and 10 are the lists of equivalent widths of all metal lines measured in the spectra of the galactic centre stars and the standards @xmath49her , and @xmath48peg . and is available electronically *    afflerbach a. , churchwell e. , werner m.w .",
