    "topological phases of lattice models recently attracted interest because of their potential use as quantum memories and quantum computers @xcite . while it is unclear whether their shortcomings at finite temperature can be satisfactorily resolved @xcite ,",
    "these models remain appealing as systems with topological order @xcite and quantum error correcting codes .",
    "the first such proposal was kitaev s paper @xcite , where the abelian toric code was introduced , and a class of non - abelian generalisations , the quantum double models , with roots in the theory of hopf algebras .",
    "these are examples of gauge models with discrete gauge group @xcite .",
    "more recently , levin and wen @xcite introduced their string - net models , arguing for string - net condensation as a basic mechanism underlying topological order .",
    "a crucial device in the formulation of these models is the fat lattice , which allows an interpretation of the lattice model in terms of a theory in the continuum , and provides insight in the role of the operators constituting the hamiltonian .    in order to have a handle on the properties of topological phases on the lattice",
    ", it is desirable to have as much theoretical control as possible over the form of topological states .",
    "accordingly , explicit tensor network representations for the ground state of string - net models have been recently presented .",
    "thus , ref .",
    "@xcite describes a _ projected entangled - pair state _ ( peps )",
    "representation of the toric code and resonating valence bond states , whereas a _ multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz _ ( mera ) representation of all quantum doubles @xcite and all string - net models @xcite is also known .",

    "@xcite discusses a _",
    "double line _ tensor network representation of the @xmath0 gauge model and the double - semion model .    in this work",
    "we describe a simple construction expressing the ground states of any string - net model as a tensor network constructed with @xmath1-tensors .",
    "the starting point is the form of the hamiltonian as a sum of commuting projectors , @xmath2 , which leads to the realisation of the ground level as the @xmath3 eigenspace of the product @xmath4 .",
    "the tensor network follows in a remarkably straightforward way .",
    "its form is reminiscent of a classical statistical mechanical partition function with local ( albeit possibly complex ) weights , which is why we call it a boltzmann weight tensor network .",
    "the needed ingredients are the data of the underlying tensor category as explained in @xcite , i.e. , the fusion rules and associated @xmath1-tensors .",
    "the construction is most appropriately understood from the fat lattice perspective .    in section [ sec : stringnets ] , we provide a short exposition to string - net models and the fat lattice picture . in section [ sec : networks ]",
    ", the boltzmann weight tensor network construction for string - net ground states is presented step by step .",
    "essentially , we use the projectors on the ground level in order to build a simple expression for the ground state using @xmath1-tensors .",
    "the boltzmann weight tensor network differs from the mera of ref .",
    "@xcite , also written in terms of @xmath1-tensors , in that it is much simpler than the latter  e.g . , it is a two - dimensional network , while the mera spans three dimensions . on the other hand",
    ", although conceived independently , our construction coincides for the @xmath0 gauge and double - semion models with the _",
    "double line _ tensor network of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors also hint at an unpublished result for generic string - net models .",
    "string - net models were introduced in @xcite in order to encode the universal physical properties of doubled @xmath5 topological phases of matter in quantum lattice models with few - body interactions .",
    "the simple structure of their hamiltonians reflects their conception as infrared fixed points of renormalization group flows .",
    "explicitly , these hamiltonians are exactly solvable because they are given by the sum of mutually commuting terms . in the following , we consider those models in @xcite which exhibit a well - defined continuum limit .",
    "these models are defined on a hexagonal lattice @xmath6 .",
    "local degrees of freedom are associated with oriented edges of @xmath6 and elements of the computational basis are labelled by @xmath7 .",
    "these labels may be interpreted as particle species propagating along the edges . for each label",
    "@xmath8 there is a unique label @xmath9 denoting its antiparticle , and reversing the orientation of an edge corresponds to the mapping @xmath10 . the label @xmath11 stands for the absence of any particle ( vacuum ) .",
    "furthermore , each instance of a string - net model is equipped with a set of _ fusion rules _",
    "@xmath12 specifying allowed ( @xmath13 ) and forbidden ( @xmath14 ) configurations of labels incident to a vertex . given the set of labels and their fusion rules , one can build a _ tensor category _ which includes recoupling relations encapsulated in the symbol @xmath15 ( akin to the @xmath16-symbol in the theory of angular momentum ) , and an assignment of _ quantum dimensions _",
    "@xmath17 to the labels .",
    "the _ total quantum dimension _ is given by @xmath18 .",
    "fixed - point wavefunctions are constructed from local constraints @xcite which are crafted so as to enforce topological invariance of the wavefunction .",
    "these local constraints are assembled from the objects @xmath17 , @xmath15 introduced above .",
    "furthermore there is a natural correspondence between physical configurations on @xmath6 and configurations of string - nets in the _",
    "fat lattice_. the latter is constructed from the physical lattice @xmath6 by puncturing the underlying surface at the center of each plaquette .",
    "string - nets consist of oriented strings carrying labels in the set @xmath19 , joined at trivalent branching points in a way that respects the fusion rules @xmath12 , and avoiding the punctures .",
    "string - net configurations are defined to be equivalent if they can be transformed into each other using the local relations ( smooth deformations avoiding punctures , recoupling by @xmath1-symbols , trading isolated loops for quantum dimensions , and label conservation ) .",
    "equivalence classes are identified with physical configurations .",
    "note that the physical configuration itself can be regarded as a particular string - net identical with the physical lattice .",
    "we will refer to this particular string - net as the canonical representative of the equivalence class , and its uniqueness is ensured by mac lane s coherence theorem @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian on the physical lattice reads @xmath20 where the sums range over the vertices and plaquettes of the lattice .",
    "vertex terms are projectors enforcing the fusion rules @xmath21 while plaquette projectors represent the kinetic part of the hamiltonian and are defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 acts on the plaquette @xmath24 together with the outer legs of @xmath24 .",
    "its precise definition is given in @xcite , as well as the following simple graphical interpretation on the fat lattice : @xmath23 creates an isolated loop of label @xmath25 around the puncture at plaquette @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the dual lattice of @xmath6 .",
    "it is instructive to decompose the edge set of @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the set of horizontal edges , @xmath29 one set of parallel diagonal edges , and @xmath30 the other one as can be seen from fig .",

    "horizontal edges ( blue ) of @xmath26 belong to @xmath28 , diagonal edges ( red ) to @xmath29 and diagonal edges ( green ) to @xmath30 .",
    "the directed edges of @xmath6 are labelled by uniquely associating them to a face . circled vertices of @xmath6",
    "belong to the even sublattice @xmath31 , filled ones to the odd sublattice @xmath32 . ]",
    "@xmath33 @xmath33     in order to construct an explicit graphical expression for a ground state of a string - net model , we start with the state @xmath34 on the physical lattice where all edges carry the vacuum label @xmath11 . note that this can be represented by a completely empty fat lattice .",
    "obviously , this state is an eigenstate of all the @xmath35 operators with eigenvalue @xmath3 .",
    "since the hamiltonian is frustration - free we end up in the ground level by applying the projection @xmath36 .",
    "thus , up to an overall factor , this ground state on the physical lattice is represented by the following string - net state on the fat lattice : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the string - net configuration shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : latticereduction](a ) .    from now on we will use the local relations of the string - net model in order to reduce eq .",
    "( [ eq : fatbaby ] ) to its canonical representative , which can be directly translated into a configuration on the physical lattice .    after applying three rounds of recouplings involving @xmath1-symbols ( @xmath1-moves ) to the strings on the fat lattice one",
    "has : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the state of the fat lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : latticereduction](b ) . using the normalization @xmath41 this expression can be simplified in the case of an infinite or periodic lattice to yield : @xmath42 note that we have omitted the @xmath43-symbols and rather restricted the sum to configurations @xmath44 that respect the branching rules of the particular string - net model .    for a full reduction to the physical lattice",
    "we eventually need to remove the loops at the vertices .",
    "this can be done by applying two @xmath1-moves at each vertex : @xmath45 here @xmath46 denote the even and odd sublattices of @xmath6 respectively and furthermore one has : @xmath47 where the faces @xmath48 of @xmath6 surround an even vertex @xmath49 or an odd vertex @xmath50 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertexloops ] .",
    "even ( circled ) and odd ( filled ) vertices of @xmath6 with their surrounding faces.,title=\"fig : \" ]   even ( circled ) and odd ( filled ) vertices of @xmath6 with their surrounding faces.,title=\"fig : \" ]    at this point the ground state of the string - net model can be written in terms of the physical lattice only : @xmath51 note that because of the convention for the @xmath1-symbols in @xcite the branching rules at each vertex are automatically satisfied and we no longer need to restrict the sum .",
    "this allows one to isolate the basis coefficients : @xmath52 it is this very expression that we are now going to write in a graphical fashion as a contracted tensor network .    in order to write the coefficients of the string - net model ground state given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefficients ] ) in a graphical fashion it is instructive to proceed locally .",
    "let us therefore consider an arbitrary face @xmath53 of @xmath6 together with its next neighbours @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , the sum over @xmath55 can now be carried out immediately and will involve no more than six @xmath1-symbols .",
    "thus we obtain the following local expression : @xmath56 now define two sets of vertex tensors for the even and odd sublattices of @xmath6 by @xmath57 } \\\\      \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics{tensors-3.pdf } } }      & : = & \\tilde{t}_{\\mu\\mu'\\nu\\nu'\\lambda\\lambda'}^{[ijk ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 }      & : = & \\sqrt{d_j}\\,f_{k\\mu i}^{\\nu^*\\!j\\lambda }      \\,\\delta_{\\mu\\mu'}\\delta_{\\nu\\nu'}\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda ' } \\\\      \\tilde{t}_{\\mu\\mu'\\nu\\nu'\\lambda\\lambda'}^{[ijk ] }      & : = & f_{j^*\\lambda k}^{\\mu^*i\\nu }      \\,\\delta_{\\mu\\mu'}\\delta_{\\nu\\nu'}\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and contract them according to the network given in fig .",
    "[ fig : tensornetwork1](a ) .",
    "if we cut out a single face of this network it can easily be verified that it exactly reproduces the local form of our coefficients as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : localcoefficient ] ) , up to the factor @xmath59 ( which can be absorbed , as the summation is extended to the adjacent faces ) .",
    "thus we have obtained a simple graphical notation that describes the ground state of an arbitrary string - net model and involves local terms only .",
    "in fact , following the arguments of @xcite , our graphical calculus encompasses the ground states of all `` doubled '' topological phases in the infrared limit .",
    "we can also pull out the indices from the vertex tensors and collect physical indices that denote particle and antiparticle into a single physical index at the edge .",
    "this can be done by defining the following tensors : @xmath60}\\ ] ]    @xmath61    where @xmath62 }      & : = & \\delta_{i\\alpha}\\delta_{\\alpha\\alpha'}\\delta_{\\mu\\mu ' }      \\delta_{\\nu\\nu'}\\\\      b_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\mu\\mu'\\nu\\nu'\\lambda\\lambda ' }      & : = & t_{\\mu\\mu'\\nu\\nu'\\lambda\\lambda'}^{[\\alpha\\beta\\gamma]}\\\\      \\tilde{b}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\mu\\mu'\\nu\\nu'\\lambda\\lambda ' }      & : = & \\tilde{t}_{\\mu\\mu'\\nu\\nu'\\lambda\\lambda'}^{[\\alpha\\beta\\gamma]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and contracting them according to fig .",
    "[ fig : tensornetwork1](b ) .",
    "note that the vertex tensors @xmath63 and @xmath64 only differ in how their indices are regarded : what used to be a physical index of @xmath63 has been changed into a virtual one of @xmath64 .",
    "thus the vertex tensors @xmath64 and @xmath65 are contracted on the virtual level exclusively .",
    "in this paper we have derived a remarkably simple tensor network representation for levin and wen s string - net ground states .",
    "this construction follows directly from the characterisation of these states as simultaneous @xmath3 eigenstates of the projectors in the hamiltonian .",
    "it also heavily relies on the notion of the fat lattice .",
    "understanding string - net models in terms of the mapping from the fat lattice to the physical lattice thus leads to insight and useful results .",
    "the tensor network is built from the fusion rules and @xmath1-tensors of the tensor category underlying the string - net model .",
    "note that from our boltzmann weight tensor network one can trivially build a peps representation . in the case of quantum double models , which can be explicitly written as string - net models , dramatic simplifications to this peps representation",
    "are possible due to their group - theoretical properties .",
    "also , for a general string - net model it is possible to express excited states by absorbing their corresponding open string operators into a ground state tensor network representation .",
    "these topics will be discussed in @xcite .    due to its simplicity (",
    "as compared to the full - fledged specification of all stabilizer operators ) this tensor network representation will help study a range of properties of the ground level sector .",
    "for example , the topological entanglement entropy @xcite is one such property hinting at the presence of a new kind of multipartite , long - range entanglement that appears to underlie topological order . along the same lines it may be interesting to establish criteria for a tensor network to represent a ground state of some topologically ordered quantum system . of course",
    ", for this it would be necessary to extend the present analysis beyond the infrared limit as given by the string - net models .",
