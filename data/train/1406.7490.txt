    "a large body of work has evolved concerning the problem of identifying an `` intruder '' vertex in a graph . as examples , one might seek to identify a malfunctioning processor in a multiprocessor network , or the location of an intruder such as a thief , saboteur or fire in a graph - modeled facility . in this paper",
    ", we introduce the new model of _ centroidal detection _ as such a graph identification problem .",
    "an early model considered the case where one could place detection devices like sonar or loran stations at vertices in a graph ; each detection device could determine the distance to the intruder s vertex location .",
    "as introduced independently in slater  @xcite and harary and melter  @xcite , vertex set @xmath8 is a _ locating set _ ( also called _ resolving set _ in the literature ) if for each vertex @xmath9 , the ( ordered ) @xmath10-tuple @xmath11 of distances between the detector s locations and the intruder vertex @xmath12 uniquely determines @xmath12 . a minimum cardinality locating set",
    "is called a _ metric basis _ ( also called _ reference set _ in the literature ) , and its order is the _ metric dimension _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "other studies involving metric bases include for example  @xcite .",
    "carson  @xcite and , independently , delmas , gravier , montassier and parreau  @xcite ( for the latter authors , under the name of _ light @xmath14-codes _ ) considered the case in which each detection device at @xmath15 can only detect an intruder at distance at most  @xmath14 .    in another model",

    "clearly , in the latter model , if every possible intruder location must be detectable , the set of detector locations must form a dominating set .",
    "the concepts of locating and dominating set were merged in slater  @xcite : when a detection device at vertex @xmath17 can distinguish between there being an intruder at @xmath17 or at a vertex in @xmath18 ( but which precise vertex in @xmath18 can not be determined ) , then we have the concept of a _ locating - dominating set_. more precisely , a set @xmath22 of vertices is locating - dominating if it is dominating and every vertex in @xmath23 is dominated by a distinct subset of @xmath22 .",

    ". however , exact distances to the intruder are not known , but for detection devices @xmath27 , if there is an intruder at vertex @xmath28 , then the presence of the intruder in the graph is determined earlier by @xmath17 than by @xmath12 when @xmath17 is closer to @xmath28 than @xmath12 , that is , when @xmath29 .",

    "the smallest size of a set @xmath39 for which the order of reporting uniquely identifies each vertex is , in fact , four .      in 1869 , jordan  @xcite showed that each of the center and the ( branch weight ) centroid of a tree either consists of one vertex , or of two adjacent vertices .",
    "eccentricity _ of vertex @xmath17 is the maximum distance from @xmath17 to another vertex in graph @xmath0 , @xmath40 , and the _ center _ @xmath41 of @xmath0 is the set of vertices of minimum eccentricity . for a tree @xmath42 ,",

    "simply the presence will be noted , with no information about the location of the intruder . in particular , unlike in the setting of metric bases , @xmath60 will not be known .",

    "@xmath421 is defined in the same way as for our construction for cycles , but now we also consider a set @xmath478 similar to @xmath421 , but on the other end of the path .",
    "we have @xmath479 , and similar arguments than for the construction for cycles show that @xmath480 is a centroidal locating set .",
    "hence , assuming @xmath386 for some @xmath481 and setting @xmath482 and @xmath399 , we get that @xmath483 .    for the general bound ,",
    "once again we do not optimize the constant .",

    "this implies @xmath493 . since @xmath494 , @xmath495 ; hence , @xmath496 .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the computational complexity of finding a small centroidal locating set , that is , the computational complexity of the following problem : +      we have seen in theorem  [ thm : bound - diam2 ] that for any graph of diameter  2 , @xmath497 .",
    "we get the following corollary , showing that centroidal dimension is computationally very hard , even from the approximation point of view ( recall that an @xmath498-approximation algorithm for problem @xmath311 is a polynomial - time algorithm for @xmath311 which always outputs a solution of size no greater than @xmath498 times the size of an optimal solution ) .",

    "indeed , given an @xmath498-approximate locating - dominating set @xmath22 of @xmath0 , we construct a centroidal locating set of @xmath0 of size at most @xmath502 .",
    "we have @xmath503 . for the converse",
    ", the reasoning is similar .",
    "this also implies that if minimum locating - dominating set is -hard to @xmath498-approximate for graphs of diameter  2 for some @xmath504 , then centroidal dimension is -hard to approximate within factor @xmath505 for graphs of diameter  2 .",
    "moreover , it follows from a reduction for minimum identifying code in the first author s thesis  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.4 ) and a lemma from gravier , klasing and moncel  @xcite ( see also foucaud  @xcite ) that minimum locating - dominating set is -hard to approximate within a factor of @xmath95 for graphs having a vertex adjacent to all other vertices .",
    "this proves the non - approximability bound .",
    "note that corollary  [ cor : complexity ] fully determines the computational complexity of centroidal dimension in graphs of diameter  2 from the approximation point of view .",
    "it was recently proved by hartung and nichterlein that the related problem metric dimension remains -hard to approximate within a factor of @xmath95 even for subcubic graphs  @xcite . in general , it would be interesting to extend the result of corollary  [ cor : complexity ] to other families of graphs .    as it is often the case with domination or identification problems in graphs , a good way of reformulating",
    "our problem is to represent it as an instance of minimum set cover , which is well - known to be @xmath506-approximable ( see johnson  @xcite ) : +      for example , metric dimension for a graph @xmath0 can be expressed in this way by constructing a hypergraph @xmath510 on vertex set @xmath511 with a hyperedge @xmath512 for each vertex @xmath9 containing all pairs @xmath513 of vertices with @xmath514 .",
    "then @xmath510 has a set cover of size @xmath10 if and only if @xmath0 has a locating set of size @xmath10 , as shown by khuller , raghavachari and rosenfeld  @xcite .",
    "hence metric dimension is @xmath499-approximable .        using observation  [ obs : otherdef ] , finding a centroidal locating set is equivalent to finding a set of _ pairs _ of vertices which identifies each pair of vertices in @xmath0  where a pair @xmath82 identifies @xmath79 if @xmath83 but @xmath84 , or @xmath515 and @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph on @xmath3 vertices .",
    "we define the hypergraph @xmath516 on vertex set @xmath517 . for each pair @xmath513 of vertices of @xmath0",
    ", @xmath518 has a hyperedge @xmath519 that contains all pairs that are identified by @xmath513 .",
    "let @xmath172 be a set cover of @xmath518 .",
    "using our previous observation , one can construct a centroidal locating set @xmath520 of @xmath0 by taking the union of all elements in the pairs that correspond to hyperedges in @xmath172 : @xmath521 .",
    "indeed , every pair of vertices of @xmath0 is identified by a pair corresponding to a hyperedge of @xmath518 .",
    "hence we have : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     for the other direction , given a centroidal basis @xmath65 of @xmath0 , one can construct a set cover of @xmath518 consisting of all @xmath377 pairs of vertices of @xmath65 : each pair @xmath27 in @xmath81 is identified by some pair @xmath79 in @xmath65 , hence vertex @xmath312 in @xmath518 is covered by the corresponding hyperedge @xmath519 . denoting by @xmath523 the size of an optimal set cover of @xmath518 ,",
    "this implies : @xmath524    now , in order to approximate centroidal dimension , we construct @xmath516 from @xmath0 , and apply the standard approximation algorithm for minimum set cover  @xcite to get a set cover @xmath172 of @xmath518 of size @xmath525 . by inequalities   and  , we get a centroidal locating set @xmath520 of size at most @xmath526 .",
    "we note that the quadratic dependence between @xmath523 and @xmath2 is necessary for inequality   in the reduction of theorem  [ thm : sqrtn - approx ] . indeed , when we considered the case of cycles in section  [ sec : paths - cycles ] , we had @xmath3 special pairs to distinguish using other pairs @xmath82 from @xmath65 , but any pair @xmath82 could only distinguish a small ( constant ) number of these @xmath3 pairs .",
    "however , we could build a centroidal locating set @xmath65 of size @xmath531 , meaning that a large fraction of the pairs from @xmath65 were indeed necessary to distinguish the pairs .",
    "hence this would lead to a set cover of @xmath518 of size @xmath532 in our reduction .",
    "this suggests that one can not improve the approximation ratio from theorem  [ thm : sqrtn - approx ] for centroidal dimension by using our reduction .",
    "hence we ask the following question :      we close the section with a remark on the parameterized complexity of centroidal dimension : this problem is fixed - parameter - tractable with parameter @xmath10 , the size of the solution , that is , it admits an algorithm of running time @xmath533 for some computable function  @xmath534 :      we know that the order @xmath3 of a graph with a centroidal locating set of size @xmath10 is at most @xmath66 , hence , if the input has more thatn @xmath66 vertices , we answer no .",
    "otherwise , we enumerate all @xmath535 subsets of vertices of size  @xmath10 to check if one of them is a centroidal locating set ( checking whether a given set is centroidal locating can be done in time @xmath536 ) .",
    "this algorithm has running time @xmath537 , which is computable and only depends on @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to proposition  [ prop : fpt ] , it was proved by hartung and nichterlein  @xcite that deciding whether there is a solution of size @xmath10 for metric dimension is highly unlikely to be solvable by an algorithm of running time @xmath538 .    * acknowledgements . *",
