    "at @xmath0 , a large fraction of all high mass stars form in dusty galaxies @xcite . most of the intrinsic uv emission from newly formed stars in these galaxies is obscured , or absorbed by dust grains that subsequently heat up and radiate at ir wavelengths .",
    "the ir luminosity resulting from this obscuration is usually much greater than the emergent uv luminosity . for galaxies",
    "in which the intrinsic uv emission from newly formed stars is less obscured , the ir luminosity is still greater than the emergent uv luminosity , but to a lesser degree @xcite .",
    "the relation between the ir and emergent uv emission from a @xmath0 galaxy depends on the interplay between star formation and dust obscuration .",
    "one of the many ways to select dusty galaxies at @xmath0 , without redshift determinations from spectroscopy , is to use the ratio of observed 24 to 0.65@xmath1 ( @xmath4-band ) flux densities @xcite .",
    "sources satisfying @xmath5 have been termed `` dust - obscured galaxies '' , or dogs ; their redshift distribution is approximately a gaussian that peaks at @xmath6 with @xmath7 @xcite . in the redshift range @xmath8 ,",
    "0.65@xmath1 observations are sensitive to rest - frame uv emission from newly formed massive stars , and 24@xmath1 observations are sensitive to mid - ir emission from hot dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "the dog criterion is thus unique in that it selects galaxies in a specific redshift range , that also exhibit extreme ratios between their rest - frame mid - ir and uv flux densities .",
    "we have yet to understand the physical mechanism driving the span of ratios exhibited by dusty galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the ir luminosities of dogs with @xmath9 are dominated by emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant sources of the ir luminosities of less luminous dogs is a topic of debate . @xcite and @xcite",
    "conclude that the ir luminosities of many dogs with @xmath10 originate from agn , while @xcite conclude that many such dogs are powered by newly formed stars .    in this paper",
    ", we pose the question `` what makes a dog a dog ? ''",
    "the primary goal of our study is determining why dogs have an extreme ratio between their rest - frame mid - ir and uv flux densities when compared to other dusty galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the simple and singular selection criterion can not distinguish between a dog that is :    * abnormally bright at rest - frame @xmath11 for its far - ir flux density , indicating its mid - ir luminosity may be dominated by agn emission , or abnormally strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ; * or , abnormally faint in the rest - frame uv for its optical flux density , indicating that dust more completely obscures the newly formed stars in the galaxy .",
    "we use _ herschel _ @xcite data in the great observatories origins deep survey - north ( goods - n ) region @xcite to show that , on average , dogs with @xmath12 are not abnormally bright at @xmath11 , but are more uv faint than other galaxies with similar ir luminosities .",
    "the ratio between rest - frame ir and uv flux densities is set by the amount of obscuration , which can vary with either : 1 ) the degree of alignment between the spatial distributions of dust and massive stars , or 2 ) the total dust content .",

    "( @xcite refer to low redshift galaxies with bright uv - emitting regions as `` starbursts '' ; the term does not necessarily refer to galaxies that deviate from the main sequence . )",
    "this relation is generally interpreted to mean that the ir emission originates as uv emission from newly formed stars , which is partially absorbed by dust .",
    "the dependence between the emergent uv emission , the dust emission in the ir , and @xmath42 , in the local irx-@xmath42 relation is consistent with the dependence of dust absorption on @xmath42 in the @xcite dust attenuation law . in other words",
    ", we think that galaxies that lie on this relation are thought to have spatially coincident uv- and ir - emitting regions .",
    "@xcite show that most lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) at @xmath0 lie on the local irx-@xmath42 relation . however , both @xmath0 lbgs and the low redshift starbursts in @xcite are much less dusty than dogs",

    "individual galaxies , in both the dog and control samples , are found on either side of the relation .",
    "because dogs are so faint in the uv , it is difficult to precisely determine the power - law indices of their uv seds ; the large uncertainties on @xmath42 values preclude us from reaching firm conclusions about individual galaxies .",
    "the median @xmath42 values for the dog and control samples tend to lie to the left of the local irx-@xmath42 relation ; dogs do not appear to deviate more strongly from the relation than do control galaxies .",
    "these @xmath0 dusty galaxies define their own irx-@xmath42 relation .",
    "as noted earlier , specific sub - populations of dusty galaxies deviate from the local relation , but the trend that we find between the averages for a broader @xmath0 population has not been discussed . because the median @xmath42 value increases with increasing irx , from the lbgs to the dogs , the ir emission is not completely independent of the emergent uv emission in these galaxies .",
    "this reinforces our initial conclusion that @xmath0 dusty galaxies populate a continuum of uv obscuration , and that dogs are simply the most heavily obscured galaxies .",

    "filled hourglasses and circles show the median @xmath42 values , in bins of irx ; the vertical bars show the range of irx over which the @xmath42 values are binned .",
    "the `` average lbg '' black asterisk is from @xcite , and shows a mean and its dispersion .",
    "the solid line is the local irx-@xmath42 relation from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : irxbeta ] ]    dogs in the luminosity range spanned by our sample are more obscured than the control galaxies for a reason unrelated to their far - ir luminosity , because the @xmath41 distributions of the two samples are statistically indistinguishable . in galaxies with dust heated by uv emission from newly formed stars , the amount of obscuration affecting that uv emission can vary due to either : 1 ) differences in the degree of alignment between the spatial distributions of dust and newly formed massive stars ; or 2 ) differences in the total dust content .",
    "@xcite derive the local irx-@xmath42 relation by assuming a uniform screen of dust in the line of sight between us and the newly formed stars ( see figure 8 in @xcite for an illustration ) .",
    "@xcite show that this assumption can be recovered when the dust is instead distributed in clumps around star - forming regions .",
    "thus , dogs might be more obscured than the control galaxies because dogs have more dust clumps surrounding star - forming regions .",
    "variations in uv obscuration might also be caused by differences in the physical properties responsible for the shape of the sub - millimeter sed .",
    "for example , increases in the mass of cold dust can result in greater uv obscuration .",
    "increases in the cold dust mass can also result in increases in sub - millimeter emission .",
    "since the sub - millimeter luminosity is usually a small fraction of the total ir luminosity , the increase in total ir luminosity due to a higher cold dust mass would not be easily measurable between 100 and 250@xmath1 .",
    "we can not fully test this hypothesis without sub - millimeter luminosities for galaxies in our samples .",
    "the sensitivities of current sub - millimeter facilities limit comparisons of the dust content between dogs and control galaxies to the most luminous ( @xmath70 ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "currently available data do not allow us to discriminate between any hypotheses for the physical mechanisms responsible for either the differences in the degree of alignment between dust and stars or differences in the dust content .",
    "for instance , two plausible hypotheses are that : 1 ) galaxy inclination might be responsible for the patchiness of dust in the line - of - sight , and 2 ) many dogs are merging galaxies , and some aspect of the merging process creates differences in the degree of alignment . to falsify",
    "either we require high resolution rest - frame optical images ; the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ) will obtain such images using _",
    "hst_/wfc3 in the near future @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite examine rest - frame optical images of dogs in goods - s and conclude that most are undisturbed disk galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite simulate isolated galaxies that meet the dog selection criterion , so dogs are not necessarily merging galaxies on the basis of their extreme rest - frame mid - ir to uv flux density ratios .    finally , uv obscuration is affected by the prominence of the `` dust bump '' at rest - frame 2175    in a galaxy s attenuation curve . at @xmath0 , rest - frame 2175    is redshifted into the @xmath4-band filter .",
    "the presence of this feature in the attenuation curves of high redshift galaxies has been controversial ; the bump is found , though , in the attenuation curves for several samples of galaxies at @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "however , doubling the amplitude of the average bump leads to a reduction in the 0.65@xmath1 flux density by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "this is not large enough to explain the spread of @xmath67 in fig .",

    "we compare the rest - frame far - ir and optical flux densities of dogs with those of the control galaxies .",
    "dogs have extreme ratios of @xmath78 not because they are abnormally bright at rest - frame @xmath11 for their far - ir flux densities , but because they are abnormally faint in the rest - frame uv .",
    "4 .   dogs and the control galaxies scatter around the median specific sfr established by @xmath0 galaxies falling on the `` main sequence '' ; 20% of dogs have specific sfrs greater than 3 times the median value , and are thus starbursts .",
    "if uv - emitting regions in high - redshift starbursts are distributed as they are in low - redshift starbursts , few dogs have compact uv - emitting regions .",
    "5 .   for both the dog and control samples ,",
    "the median rest - frame uv continuum power - law index ( @xmath42 ) at a given ir to uv luminosity ratio ( irx ) is lower than the index predicted by the local irx-@xmath42 relation .",
    "dogs do not appear to deviate more from this relation than do the control galaxies . over more than a factor of 100 in irx",
    ", the median @xmath42 value for these galaxies systematically increases with increasing irx .",
    "these pieces of evidence suggest that , for most of these galaxies , the uv- and ir - emitting regions are spatially coincident .",
    "thus , the range in rest - frame mid - ir to uv flux density ratios spanned by dusty galaxies at @xmath0 is due to differing amounts of uv obscuration .",
    "dogs are the most heavily obscured galaxies .",
    "differences in the amount of obscuration between dogs and other dusty galaxies at @xmath0 can be due to : 1 ) differences in the degree of alignment between the spatial distributions of dust and massive stars , or 2 ) differences in the total dust content .",
    "our samples do not have many galaxies with @xmath9 . in dogs with these ir luminosities , where agn emission may be the dominant source of dust heating , our conclusions about obscuration may not be valid .",
    "further information about the nature of obscuration in these galaxies can come from measurements that spatially resolve uv- and ir - emitting regions .",
