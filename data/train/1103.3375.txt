    "this review was not specially written for the _ uspekhi fizicheskikh nauk ( physics - uspekhi ) _ issue devoted to the memory of v l ginzburg .",
    "nevertheless , i would like to hope that the spirit of this review is close to that of other papers in this issue .",
    "i was happy to work closely with vitaly lazarevich for more than 30 years , starting from my graduate student days , and he definitely played a significant role in my scientific development .",
    "so , this review , hopefully , bears a fraction of the soul of vitaly lazarevich .",
    "vitaly lazarevich was a passionate person .",
    "astrophysics , undoubtedly , fascinated him most .",
    "but the scale of his personality was such that this passion did not separate , but instead united , people .",
    "so , it is not surprising that at the lebedev institute the astrophysical seminar headed by vitaly lazarevich for more than several decades continues , and scientists from many institutes participate in its work .",
    "the department of physics and astrophysics problems at moscow institute of physics and technology ( mipt ) , which vitaly lazarevich founded in 1968 and headed until recently , continues to be one of the leading institutions in teaching young astrophysicists . numerous pupils of v l ginzburg and pupils of his pupils working in the leading astrophysical centers of the world keep his unique trademark in their studies .",
    "the astrophysical heritage of v l ginzburg is enormous .",
    "he obtained fundamental results in the theory of propagation of electromagnetic waves in cosmic plasma , in the theory of the origin of cosmic rays , and in the theory of neutron stars and black holes . in all cases , a simple model allowing the understanding of the essence of physical process in observed astrophysical sources laid the basis of the theory .",
    "the present review , hopefully , was written in the same spirit .",
    "astronomy , as follows from the very appellation , is the science that stemmed from the observations of stars . during hundreds of years the people observed stars in the sky and gained insight into the laws of nature .",
    "the stars appeared to be always unchanged and existing for an infinite amount of time .",
    "after the appearance of spectral analysis , the first astrophysical observations and , later , the theory of radiation generally confirmed this point of view .",
    "the lifetimes of most stars turned out to be comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "thus , in the 1950s , when radio astronomy began , stars emitting thermal radiation seemed to be the main objects for studies . in radio astronomy ,",
    "the brightness temperature remains even now the basic characteristic of radiation intensity .",
    "however , the first radio astronomical observations , and especially observations in the x - ray and gamma - ray ranges , which started in the middle of the 1970s , discovered numerous nonthermal sources in the universe .",
    "these objects are sufficiently compact ( i.e. , the spatial resolution of the existing detectors is insufficient to determine their internal structure ) and , in addition , are highly variable . in active galactic nuclei",
    "the variability timescale ( months or sometimes even days ) is small according to the cosmic timescale , with the variability timescale of radio pulsars and sources of gamma - ray bursts being the fractions of a second , which is small even to earth s measures .",
    "the activity , i.e. , high variability on timescales @xmath0 , as well as the generation of nonthermal radiation indicates that in most cases we are dealing with relativistic objects , namely , with objects in which matter moves with velocities close to the speed of light .",
    "jet eruptions represent one of the visible appearances of the activity of compact astrophysical objects .",
    "we shall briefly discuss their properties in section 2 .",
    "they are observed in both relativistic objects ( such as active galactic nuclei and microquasars ) and in young stars where the motion of matter is definitely nonrelativistic .",
    "this means that we are dealing with some universal and extremely efficient mechanism of energy release .",
    "therefore , the key theoretical problems include the question of the energy source of the activity of compact objects , the understanding of their energy release mechanism , and the collimation of matter outflows .",
    "we shall postpone the detailed discussion of arguments against alternative models until the next section , and here we only remind the main arguments favoring the magnetohydrody - namic model of activity of compact sources , which is accepted by most astrophysicists .",
    "the model of the unipolar inductor , i.e. , the source of direct current , lies at the heart of the magnetohydrodynamic approach .",
    "as we shall show in section 2 , conditions for the existence of such a central engine are satisfied in all the compact sources discussed below .",
    "indeed , all compact sources are assumed to harbor a rapidly spinning central body ( black hole , neutron star , or young star ) and some regular magnetic field , which leads to the emergence of strong induction electric fields .",
    "the electric fields , in turn , lead to the appearance of longitudinal electric currents and effective particle acceleration . the collimation mechanism in this model",
    "is related to the well - known property of mutual attraction of parallel currents .",
    "the first studies of the electromagnetic model of compact sources ( namely , radio pulsars ) were carried out as early as the end of the 1960s [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "it was evidenced that there are objects in the universe in which electrodynamical processes can play the decisive role in the energy release .",
    "then , in 1976 r blandford [ 5 ] and r lovelace [ 6 ] independently suggested that the same mechanism can also operate in active galactic nuclei . in the same year , g s bisnovatyi - kogan , yu p popov , and a a samokhin proposed a magnetorotational mechanism of the supernova explosion [ 7 ] ( i.e. , the model of an essentially nonstationary phenomenon ) , in which jet eruptions can also be formed [ 8 ] .",
    "this model has remained the leading one for nearly 40 years .",
    "however , only recently have some key properties become clear .",
    "this is related both to advances in the theory which have at last formulated sufficiently simple analytical relations , and to the breakthrough in numerical simulations which confirmed theoretical predictions .",
    "the reader can find the detailed introduction to the analytical theory in the author s monograph [ 9 ] ( see also the review in _ physics - uspekhi _ in 1997 [ 10 ] ) .",
    "however , first , the monograph was devoted to the basics of the theory , and qualitative predictions for specific astrophysical sources were discussed only very briefly .",
    "second , the monograph clearly could not include the results of numerical calculations carried out in the last five years since its publication .",
    "this is the main reason for writing the present review .",
    "in addition , here we shall correct formulas from the monograph in which misprints were found .    of course , we are still far away from the full understanding of the essence of physical processes proceeding in compact sources .",
    "in fact , now we have only agreement between theory and numerical modeling .",
    "all results have been obtained applying ideal one - liquid magnetohydrodynamics , though by different methods ( the theory is based on stationary equations , while numerically the time relaxation problem is solved ) . in particular , it is not yet clear which of the main physical characteristics of the central engine ( such as the mass of the central body or its rotation velocity ) should fully determine the observed energy release .",
    "nevertheless , the progress achieved over recent years raises hopes for test observations already in the nearest future , which can give insight into physical processes occurring in active astrophysical sources .",
    "the main properties of the central engine in active galactic nuclei , which are presently accepted by most astrophysicists , can be summarized as follows [ 11,12 ] . in the center of the host galaxy",
    "there is a supermassive black hole ( its mass reaches @xmath1@xmath2 , where is the mass of the sun ) , onto which accretion of the surrounding matter occurs [ 13 ] . only in this case",
    "it is possible to explain the very high efficiency of the energy release and the compactness of the central engine .",
    "the energy source of activity of galactic nuclei can be related to both the rotational energy of the black hole , viz . @xmath3 and the energy of the accreting matter .",
    "here is the radius of the black hole , @xmath4 is the moment of inertia , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the angular velocity and the mass of the black hole , respectively , and @xmath7 is the speed of light .",
    "the existence of supermassive objects is also supported by the fact that the eddington luminosity @xmath8 ( i.e. , the luminosity at which the gravitational force acting on the accreting matter is balanced by the radiation pressure force ) is close to the characteristic luminosity of active galactic nuclei [ 14 ] . moreover ,",
    "the duration of the active phase @xmath9 estimated using formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is on the order of @xmath10 years , which is also in agreement with observations .",
    "further , it is usually assumed that the accretion of matter proceeds through a disc [ 15 ] .",
    "thus , the preferential direction  the axis of rotation  emerges naturally in space , along which the formation of jets is possible . as a black hole",
    "itself can not have the self - magnetic field ( the so - called no - hair theorem ) , the generation of a large - scale magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole is believed to occur in the accretion disc [ 16 - 18 ] .    .",
    "the distance between bright spots is about 80 kpc , which is 9 - 10 orders of magnitude greater than the size of the central black hole . ]",
    "according to the modern concept , massive central objects are present in most galaxies and remain active only if a sufficient amount of matter falls on them .",
    "this restricts their active lifetime .",
    "unfortunately , as stated above , the angular resolution of modern detectors does not allow us to directly observe plasma flow on the scales comparable to the black hole size therefore , we have to judge the activity of galactic nuclei only using indirect evidence , by observing flows on much larger scales .",
    "let us remember that the diffuse radio emission around active galaxies is observed from regions located at distances of tens or even a hundred kiloparsecs from their nuclei .",
    "very shortly after the discovery of these regions at the beginning of the 1960s , this emission was associated with collimated plasma ejections ( jets ) flowing out the galactic nuclei [ 12 ] .",
    "it is precisely these jets that transport matter and energy from the active nuclei to those regions ( fig .",
    "observations show that the jets can be accelerated and collimated very close to a galactic nucleus .",
    "for example , in the case of the nearest active galaxy m87 the formation of the jet occurs within a radius of @xmath11 from the nucleus [ 19 ] . in recent years",
    ", the internal structure close to the jet base was resolved in several sources , where the jet tranverse dimension usually does not exceed several parsecs [ 21 , 22 ] ( fig .",
    "the jet transverse size is about 1 pc . ]",
    "the matter in jets from active galactic nuclei has a very high energy  the bulk lorentz factor of a jet is at least a few unities .",
    "for example , this motion is directly observed in the m87 galaxy , with the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow being @xmath12 [ 23 ] . in many cases ,",
    "the matter continues moving with relativistic velocities up to huge distances from the nucleus before noticeable braking due to interaction with the ambient intergalactic medium .",
    "another peculiar feature of jets is their high degree of collimation within a cone characterized by an opening angle of only several degrees .",
    "unfortunately , observations do not yet allow reliable estimations of the energy and mass fluxes in jets from active galactic nuclei , of the magnitude of the magnetic field both close to the black hole and in the jet itself , or of the composition of jet eruptions .",
    "the spectrum of radiation from galactic jets ( in contrast , for example , to the spectrum of jets from young stars ) does not exhibit any spectral features of moving matter , i.e. , neither atomic ( ionic ) lines nor the electron - positron pair annihilation line are observed . to this regard , there are arguments both in favor [ 24 ] and against [ 25 ] the leading role of electron - positron plasma , so it is now impossible to say exactly which mechanism of energy transfer to the jet actually operates .    where a physical nature of the galactic nucleous activity is concerned ,",
    "several mechanisms of particle acceleration and jet collimation have been proposed , but so far there is no definite answer as to which of them are actually realized .",
    "it is possible that different mechanisms operate in different sources , or , just the opposite , all mechanisms are realized simultaneously .",
    "_ gas - dynamic acceleration_. the acceleration and collimation of a jet can be related to the presence of an ambient medium with high pressure which decreases with distance from the center [ 26 , 27 ] .",
    "such a medium could play the role of an external wall collimating the outflow .",
    "the pressure of the external hot medium can , in principle , be estimated from x - ray observations [ 28 ] .",
    "this mechanism possibly explains how weak jets in our galaxy and in some seyfert galaxies ( i.e. , low - active galaxies ) are formed . on the other hand , the observed pressure of the hot matter around the most powerful jets from active galactic nuclei is not sufficiently high , and there must be an alternative mechanism of plasma confinement .    _",
    "acceleration by radiation_. as the photon density near the central source can be very high , the radiation - driven mechanism of jet matter acceleration by radiation pressure was proposed [ 29 , 30 ] . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that the inner parts of the disc can serve as a nozzle directing matter outflows accelerated by the radiation pressure .",
    "however , this mechanism also meets some difficulties .",
    "for example , there is no correlation between the jet power and the luminosity of the source  many sources with very powerful jets are low - luminous sources [ 31 ] .",
    "another difficulty comes from the fact that , starting from the sufficiently low particle energies @xmath13 , the radiation field more effectively brakes particles than accelerates them [ 32 ] .",
    "this contradicts observations of superluminal sources in which the energy of plasma particles is much higher .",
    "in addition , if the jet was formed in a system with a thin accretion disc emitting radiation more or less isotropically , additional mechanisms for the jet collimation should be invoked . a modification of this model involving the formation of a funnel in a thick accretion disc can explain the initial jet collimation , but there are indications that such a structure is unstable [ 31 ] .",
    "_ magnetohydrodynamic mechanism_. as noted above , most researchers favor the magnetohydrodynamic model of jet formation . the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model was successfully utilized to describe many processes in active nuclei , and , in particular , in connection with the problem of the origin and stability of jets , as well as to explain the energetics of processes proceeding near the central black hole .",
    "the magnetic field here is the natural link between the central engine and the jet .",
    "moreover , in this model it is easy to understand why the jet matter can predominantly consist of electron - positron plasma .",
    "as was shown in refs [ 33 - 35 ] , it can be generated on the magnetic field lines threading the black hole horizon .    in the simplest version ,",
    "the picture is as follows : the regular magnetic field generated in the disc links the spinning central engine ( the disc and the black hole ) with infinity .",
    "the plasma outflow occurs along the magnetic field lines ; the electromagnetic energy flux is also directed along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the longitudinal electric current flowing along the jet forms a toroidal magnetic field , and the magnetic field pressure associated with this toroidal component can collimate the jet .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in a real astrophysical system the total current flowing from the central engine should vanish , so the ampere force in the current closure region will , on the contrary , decollimate the flow ( the antiparallel currents repulse ) .",
    "therefore , an external medium ( for example , a subrelativistic wind outflow from the accretion disc ) is necessary to collimate the jet . in addition , the question as to whether it is possible to consider a black hole immersed in the external magnetic field as a unipolar inductor turned out to be also rather nontrivial .",
    "it required almost 30 years of studies after the paper by blandford and znajek [ 33 ] , which laid the basis of the theory in 1977 , before the needed clarity was reached in this question .",
    "we shall discuss these points in more detail in section 3 .",
    "microquasars comprise galactic objects in which the jet formation is due to accretion onto a compact relativistic object ( neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "in other words , all microquasars reside in sufficiently close binary systems in which the effective flow of matter from the star companion occurs . the rate of matter inflow in such systems is larger than can be swallowed by the central object . as a result ,",
    "some accreting matter that carries , in particular , an excessive angular momentum is expelled from the system in the form of jets .",
    "observations of microquasars show that jets are related to thick accretion discs .",
    "in other words , no jets are known for systems with thin discs .",
    "the reason for that is unclear : either a thin disc insufficiently collimates the outflow , or the magnetic field generated by the thin disc is not strong enough .",
    "microquasars represent a small population of objects , including only around ten sources [ 36 ] , with only half of them demonstrating noticeable relativistic jets the characteristic longitudinal size of jets is usually , with the jet spread angle being within several degrees ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the total energetics are about @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 . due to the relativistic velocity of the bulk motion of matter in the jets ,",
    "some sources demonstrate the superluminal motion effect , with the apparent angular velocity being several orders of magnitude larger ( due to a relative proximity of these objects ) than that observed in jets from active galactic nuclei .",
    "pc [ 38 ] . ]",
    "historically , the first revealed object of this class was the famous source ss433 [ 37 ] in which , however , the gas ejection velocity in jets is only @xmath16 .",
    "such a velocity can be easily explained by the radiation pressure from highly heated internal regions of the accretion disc . as for relativistic jets",
    ", the first source was discovered only in 1994 [ 38 ] .",
    "since the appearance of near - light velocities due to radiation or gas pressure is problematic , it has not been ruled out that , to explain them , an electrodynamic model similar to that used in explaining the origin and collimation of extragalactic jets should be invoked again .",
    "this model is also supported by the fact that in all but one microquasar ( ss433 ) no emission lines from jets are observed .",
    "this indirectly points to the electron - positron composition of matter in jets [ 36 ] .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in most microquasars the jet is separated in individual blobs at large distances from the central engine , which is thought to be due to a long duty cycle of the work of the central engine .      as regards the sources of cosmological gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "there are indirect , although sufficiently reliable , arguments in favor of the presence of jets related exactly to relativistic strongly magnetized outflows , which we shall discuss in this review .",
    "it is well known that the discovery of the optical afterglow [ 39 ] , as well as afterglows in other spectral ranges , which allowed the measurement of the distance to these sources from the observed redshifts of the host galaxies , put serious constraints on their energetics [ 40 ] . if the observed gamma - ray radiation were emitted isotropically , the total energy release for the typical distance to these sources of several gigaparsecs would reach @xmath17 erg .",
    "however , we do not know at present processes with such huge energy liberation . on the other hand ,",
    "the small duration of the burst restricts the size of the emission region , which , in turn , does not allow us to explain the observed nonthermal gamma - ray spectra , since the optical depth in the source proves to be very high [ 41 ] .",
    "if it is assumed that gamma - rays are emitted within a narrow cone angle @xmath18 , the observed energy can be reduced to @xmath19 erg , which is already to an order of magnitude of the energy release during supernova explosions . on the other hand , the observed optically thin nonthermal gamma - ray spectra",
    "immediately imply the presence of ultrarelativistic outflows with bulk lorentz factors of @xmath20@xmath21 . only in this case",
    "can the compactness problem of the source be resolved , since the estimated size of the emitting region also increases as the square of the bulk lorentz factor ( i.e. , by @xmath22@xmath23 times ) , and the optical depth , which is proportional to the density multiplied by the size of the region , decreases respectively by @xmath24@xmath25 times .    however , the ultrarelativistic character of the outflow , in turn , puts constraints on the particle composition in the jet , since the presence of a significant fraction of baryons with such energy in the outflow would contradict the total energy release in the gamma - ray burst .",
    "therefore , the contribution of protons must be smaller than @xmath26 of the total number of particles , so that only electron - positron jets should be considered .",
    "the existence of jets is also evidenced by the presence of the characteristic bend of the light curve of the afterglow , when the power law index @xmath27 in the radiation intensity dependence on time , @xmath28 , changes from @xmath29 to @xmath30 after a span of about a few days following the burst .",
    "this effect is related to the cessation of relativistic contraction of the radiation cone in the direction of particles motion toward an observer . incidentally , this model allowed independent confirmation of the jet spread angle @xmath18 and the bulk lorentz factor @xmath31@xmath21 [ 42 ] .",
    "the nature of the central engine giving rise to strongly magnetized jets can be usually related to the collision of two neutron stars [ 43 , 44 ] or of a neutron star and a black hole [ 45 ] , or , most likely , to the collapse of the massive core of an unusual supernova [ 46 , 47 ] .",
    "however , in most models a rapidly spinning solar - mass black hole ultimately emerges , which loses its rotation energy via the blandford - znajek process [ 45 , 48 50 ] .",
    "indeed , as we have seen , this process easily provides a natural explanation for both the low baryonic load of the jet and the large bulk lorentz factors of jet particles . in other words ,",
    "the model again is constructed similarly to the scheme proposed for active galactic nuclei . in particular , the key processes here also include the magnetic field generation in the plasma around the black hole , the interaction of the black hole with the accretion disc via magnetic field lines , and the generation of particles in the magnetosphere . to explain the observed energy release , it is necessary to assume that the magnetic field near the black hole must be as high as @xmath32 or even the generation of such a high field is thought to be possible in nonstationary processes like the supernova core collapse or binary neutron star coalescence [ 51 , 52 ] .",
    "the discovery of radio pulsars at the end of the 1960s , which are the sources of pulsating cosmic radio emission with the characteristic period @xmath33 s [ 53 ] , is definitely one of the major astrophysical discoveries of the 20th century .",
    "indeed , for the first time a new class of cosmic sources related to neutron stars , whose existence was theoretically predicted away back in the 1930s [ 54 ] , was discovered .",
    "neutron stars ( mass of about and radius @xmath34 of only @xmath35@xmath36 km ) must result from the catastrophic compression ( collapse ) of usual massive stars at the late stage of their evolution or , for example , of white dwarfs whose mass exceeds the chandrasekhar mass limit of @xmath37 @xmath38 due to accretion from the companion star .",
    "it is this formation mechanism that provides the simplest explanation for both small spin periods @xmath39 ( the smallest known spin period @xmath40 ms ) and superstrong magnetic fields with [ 1,2 ] .",
    "interestingly , the basic physical processes determining the observed activity of radio pulsars were understood almost immediately after their discovery .",
    "for example , it became clear that highly regular pulsations of observed radio emission are related to the rotation of neutron stars .",
    "next , radio pulsars are powered by the rotational energy of the neutron star , and the mechanism of energy release is related to their superstrong magnetic field with @xmath41 g. indeed , energy losses estimated using the simple magnetodipole formula [ 44 ] are as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath44 is the angle between the magnetic dipole axis and the spin axis , and @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the neutron star rotation . for most pulsars ,",
    "energy losses range from @xmath46@xmath47 erg s@xmath15 .",
    "these energy losses exactly correspond to the observed spin - down rate @xmath48 , or to the spin - down time @xmath49 @xmath50@xmath35 mln years .",
    "let us keep in mind that the fraction of radio emission amounts to only @xmath51@xmath52 of total energy losses .",
    "for most pulsars this corresponds to which is 57 orders of magnitude less than the luminosity of the sun .    as shown in refs [ 56 , 57 ]",
    ", the actual energy losses can not be due to magnetodipole radiation because the plasma that fills the magnetosphere will fully screen the low - frequency radiation from the neutron star .",
    "however , energy losses can be caused by longitudinal electric currents circulating in the magnetosphere and looped across the surface of the central engine . as a result , in this case ,",
    "too , the main energy release near the neutron star is related to the electromagnetic energy flux ( the poynting vector flux ) , and the total energy losses can be again estimated using formula ( 3 ) .",
    "most radio pulsars constitute single neutron stars . of the 1880 pulsars known by the middle of 2010 ,",
    "only 140 were members of binary systems .",
    "however , in all these cases it is reliably known that there is no somewhat appreciable mass transfer from the companion star to the neutron star . since",
    ", as already stressed , the radio luminosities of pulsars are low , the modern sensitivity of detectors allows observations of pulsars only up to distances of @xmath53@xmath54 kpc , which is smaller than the distance to the galactic center .",
    "therefore , we can observe only a small fraction of all active pulsars .",
    "the total number of neutron stars in our galaxy must be around such a big number of extinguished neutron stars can be naturally related to the small duration of their active life , as discussed above .",
    "the jets are only observed in crab and vela radio pulsars [ 58 , 59 ] , which is not surprising , since , in contrast to the compact objects considered above , the pulsar magnetosphere is not axisymmetric . on the other hand ,",
    "only axisymmetric configurations were actually considered until recently in the theory of pulsar wind . based on these studies ,",
    "the main features of strongly magnetized winds were understood .",
    "nevertheless , even in this approximation for smooth flows , it has thus far been impossible to construct a self - consistent model which jointly describes the energy transfer from the neutron star surface to infinity and includes effective particle acceleration , i.e. , an almost complete transformation of the electromagnetic field energy into the energy of the plasma flowing out .",
    "because of this , different models are actively being discussed at present , which , to various degrees , propose going beyond the framework of the classical scheme ( see , for example , refs [ 60 - 62 ] ) .",
    "indeed , observations show that most energy far from the neutron star must be carried by relativistic particles .",
    "for example , the analysis of the emission from the crab nebula in the shock region located at a distance of @xmath55 cm from the pulsar in the region of interaction of the pulsar wind with the supernova remnant definitely shows that the total flux @xmath56 of the electromagnetic energy in this region is no more than @xmath57 of the particle energy flux @xmath58 [ 63 ] .",
    "thus , the poynting vector flux in the asymptotically remote region must be completely converted into the outgoing plasma flux .",
    "the presently known axisymmetric numerical models of jets from radio pulsars [ 64 - 66 ] were constructed exactly under this assumption .",
    "however , the transformation apparently occurs already much closer to the neutron star , namely at distances comparable to the size of the light cylinder .",
    "this is evidenced by the detection of variable optical emission from companions in some close binary systems involving radio pulsars [ 67 ] .",
    "this variable optical emission with a period equal exactly to the orbital period of the binary can be naturally related to the heating of the companion s part facing the radio pulsar .",
    "it was found that the energy reradiated by the companion star almost matches the total energy emitted by the radio pulsar into the corresponding solid angle .",
    "clearly , this fact can not be understood either in the magnetodipole radiation model or by assuming a poynting - dominated strongly magnetized outflow , since the transformation coefficient of a low - frequency electromagnetic wave can not be close to unity .",
    "only if a significant fraction of the energy is related to the relativistic particle flux can the heating of the star s surface be effective enough .",
    "therefore , the so - called @xmath59-problem  the question as to how the energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to particles in the pulsar wind  remains one of big puzzles in modern astrophysics .",
    "jets from young stars were indirectly discovered at the beginning of the 1950s , when g herbig and g haro [ 68 , 69 ] discovered a new class of extended diffuse objects usually existing in pairs and , as became clear later , connected by thin jets with young rapidly rotating stars [ 70 ] .",
    "the formation of such jets can naturally be related to the need of removing most effectively the excessive angular momentum that prevents the formation of a star .",
    "as we see , the situation here is quite similar to that with active galactic nuclei , where first a diversity of different types of sources ( quasars , seyfert galaxies , and radio galaxies ) were discovered , and only later on did it become clear that the activity of all these sources has a similar nature .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the observational features suggests that the physical mechanism of jet formation from young stars can also be similar to that from active galactic nuclei . and",
    "this is despite the fact that physical conditions near a young star ( mass of order @xmath53@xmath35 @xmath38 , and total energy release ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath60 erg s@xmath15 are dramatically different from those in the centers of active galactic nuclei .",
    "one of the main differences here is the nonrelativistic character of gas outflow from young stars .    ) .",
    "the scale corresponds to 1000 a.u . ]    presently , more than 250 herbig - haro objects are known [ 71 ] . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , they represent bright condensations with an angular size of several seconds of arc ( linear size of order @xmath61@xmath62 a.u . ) , usually surrounded by a bright diffuse envelope .",
    "their spectra mainly show emission lines of hydrogen and some other low - excitation elements .",
    "a shock wave propagating with velocities @xmath63@xmath64 km s@xmath15 through a gas with a density of @xmath65 @xmath66 is apparently the main source of excitation [ 70 ] .    as in the case of radio galaxies ,",
    "the activity of herbig - haro objects is dictated by collimated outflows which are well seen in forbidden lines .",
    "nearly @xmath67 of the objects demonstrate both jets , while in other cases the receding jet is blocked by the accretion disc .",
    "the extent of the optical jets is of order @xmath68@xmath69 pc , and their velocity reaches @xmath70 km s@xmath15 . the gas density in the jets is estimated to be @xmath35@xmath71 @xmath66 , and the mass outflow rate comes to @xmath72@xmath73 @xmath38 yr@xmath15 .",
    "the degree of collimation of the jets ( the ratio of the observed length to the width ) can be as high as 30 .",
    "the total jet opening angle is in the range of @xmath54@xmath74 .",
    "in addition to highly elongated jets , molecular outflows with a much smaller collimation degree are observed near young stars .",
    "their size may run to and the velocity of gas motion does not exceed here we should stress that this velocity is much higher than the speed of sound in an outflow with a temperature of only @xmath35@xmath75 k. the total mass of the ejected gas is estimated to be and the total kinetic energy stored in the molecular outflows can reach @xmath76 and even @xmath77 erg . the direct observation of rotation of the jets is the most important recent discovery .",
    "the characteristic velocities at an axial distance of @xmath78@xmath79 a.u .",
    "range from 310 km s@xmath15",
    "[ 72 , 73 ] .",
    "there is also direct evidence of the spiral structure of the magnetic field in the jets [ 74 ] .",
    "all these facts unambiguously support the mhd model .    as in jets from microquasars ,",
    "a strong instability frequently develops in collimated outflows from young stars at large distances from the central engine ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , so that the outflow is split into separate blobs . on the other hand , as seen from fig . 5 ,",
    "the flow near the base of the jet can be considered sufficiently regular .    .",
    "the accretion disc is clearly seen .",
    "here also the scale corresponds to 1000 a.u . ]    as for the physical nature of collimated jet formation , this question is still far from solved .",
    "it is only clear that the power of the central engine is always sufficient to accelerate the outflowing gas ; however , the mechanism of energy transformation remains unclear .",
    "we stress that in contrast to relativistic galactic objects ( for example , microquasars ) , where the formation of jets is possibly caused by supercritical accretion , the luminosity in young stars never approaches the eddington limit .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that the key role in the collimated outflow formation is just played by accretion discs which undoubtedly exist around young stars .",
    "this is supported by the direct correlation between the power of the gas flux and the mass of the disc , estimated from its luminosity , as well as some other correlations [ 75 , 76 ] .",
    "the parameters of the discs can be very different .",
    "for example , their masses range from @xmath80@xmath71 @xmath38 , while the outer radii can vary from 10 a.u . to 0.1 pc .",
    "it is important that , in contrast to discs around relativistic objects ( neutron stars and black holes ) , the gas temperature in discs around young stars is only as a result , as in the case with active galactic nuclei , neither the radiation pressure force nor gas pressure can explain the high velocities observed in the collimated outflows [ 71 ] .",
    "therefore , to explain the jet formation and particle acceleration , models in which the magnetic field plays the key role and effectively mediates the interaction between the accretion disc and the jet were invoked once again . because the real structure of the magnetic field in the proximity of a young star is presently unknown , here , too , both models in which the magnetic field of the star itself has a dominant role [ 77 ] and models in which the magnetic field of the disc plays the decisive role [ 75 , 78 ] have been proposed .",
    "it is seen that here we meet the same problems regarding the structure of the initial magnetic field as in the study of the black hole magnetosphere .",
    "as already said , the notion of a unipolar inductor is the main physical idea that underlies the mhd theory of compact objects . referring to fig . 6",
    ", a rotating magnetized ball can serve as the battery that determines the energy release from the central engine . indeed , assuming the high conductivity of the ball , the freezing - in condition of the magnetic field , viz . @xmath81",
    "( i.e. , simply the condition that the electric field in the rotating reference frame vanishes ) , leads to the appearance of the potential difference @xmath82 between points @xmath83 and @xmath84 . to an order of magnitude",
    ", this potential difference can be @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the transverse size of the working area . as a result",
    ", the total energy release @xmath87 on the external load @xmath88 will be given as @xmath89 where the electric current @xmath90 . here , however , several conditions should be met .",
    "first , the electric circuit must touch the ball at different latitudes , i.e. , at points with different electric potentials .",
    "second , the electric circuit should rotate with an angular velocity @xmath91 different from that of the magnetized ball .",
    "the current flowing along a wire tightly welded on the ball will be absent .",
    "we stress that the energy source [ electromotive force ( emf ) ] in the unipolar inductor is due to the kinetic energy of rotation .",
    "indeed , as seen from fig .",
    "6 , charges inside the ball move against the direction of the electric field .",
    "this becomes possible due to the force by which the lattice acts on charges carried along the wire , which violate the freezing - in condition inside the ball .",
    "conversely , the ampere force acting from the side of the surface electric current on the ball s material brakes its rotation .",
    "therefore , the principle of work of the unipolar inductor ( or , as it is sometimes called , the unipolar faraday generator ) is not the faraday effect as such ( where the emf induced in a current loop depends on the variation of the magnetic flux ) , since the flux through the circuit remains constant .",
    "notice that the reverse situation is also possible : if one applies a potential difference to a magnetized ball ( i.e. , if one replaces the load in fig . 6 by the voltage source ) , the ball starts rotating .",
    "on the site http://fiziks.org.ua/samyj-prostoj-v-mire-elektrodvigatel/ , which is devoted to laboratory studies in secondary school , one can find a video illustrating the work of such a device .    as we have understood , for the central engine to operate it is necessary to have :    * rotating body ; * regular magnetic field , and * well - conducting wire .",
    "then the current , and hence the energy losses , will be determined by the value of the external resistance @xmath88 .",
    "let us see now whether these conditions can be met in compact astrophysical objects .    as we have seen , a central rotating body in active astrophysical sources is undoubtedly present .",
    "for example , the spin periods of young stars are about several days ( the inner parts of accretion discs rotate even faster ) .",
    "the spin periods of most radio pulsars are close to 1 s ; however , they can be as small as a few milliseconds , which is already close to the limiting speed of rotation ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the rotational velocities of black holes in active galactic nuclei , to tell the truth , are unknown , but we can suppose that due to disc accretion ( it is in this way that the millisecond - period pulsars are thought to have been spun up ) their spin parameter @xmath93 ( see the appendix ) can also be sufficiently large .",
    "for example , the estimate of the black hole rotational velocity in the nucleus of seyfert galaxy mcg 06 - 30 - 15 , as inferred from the iron 6.4-kev line profile distortion , yields @xmath94 [ 79 ] ( see also ref [ 80 ] ) . as a result",
    ", the kinetic energy of rotation @xmath95 stored in the central engine turns out to be quite sufficient to explain the energy source of activity of compact objects .",
    "there are no particular problems with a regular magnetic field , either . in young stars ,",
    "the proper magnetic field @xmath96 is measured directly and can be as high as at present , there are no direct observations of magnetic fields in radio pulsars , but they can be measured in x - ray ( accreting ) pulsars , which are also neutron stars [ 11 ] .",
    "therefore , nobody now doubts that the magnetic field of a neutron star can reach @xmath97 g , and even extend up to @xmath98 g in magnetars [ 81 ] .",
    "the situation is worse with the magnetic fields of supermassive black holes .",
    "as is well known , a black hole can not have a proper magnetic field , but the field can be generated in the surrounding accretion discs [ 82 ] .",
    "unfortunately , so far there is no self - consistent theory of such generation , so we have to apply the estimate @xmath99 , where @xmath100 let us keep in mind that such an estimate comes from the simple assumption that the energy density of the magnetic field is comparable to the total energy density in the accreting plasma yielding the eddington luminosity ( 2 ) .",
    "clearly , estimate ( 7 ) represents rather an upper limit of the magnetic field near the black hole . in particular",
    ", it does not take into account the contribution from the thermal pressure , which can be significant in gamma - ray burst sources .",
    "finally , the problem of the electric wiring can also be easily solved at first glance . due to the presence of a strong magnetic field , in all cases the larmor radius of particles",
    "@xmath101 is always much smaller than the size @xmath34 of the central engine .",
    "therefore , one can consider with good accuracy that the electric current flows along the direction of the regular magnetic field .",
    "however , here we meet the problem of current closing , since particles in the region of the load must move across the magnetic field .",
    "we shall necessarily discuss this point below .",
    "as an example , fig . 7 illustrates how the braking occurs in an axisymmetric magnetosphere of radio pulsars . clearly , the total current flowing out of the pulsar surface must vanish ; thus , there must necessarily be a reverse current in the magnetosphere to compensate for the loss of charges from the neutron star . as a result ,",
    "currents @xmath102 closing the longitudinal currents in the magnetosphere must flow over the pulsar surface .",
    "the ponderomotive action of these currents must brake the rotation of the radio pulsars [ 3 , 56 ] .",
    ", produces the torque @xmath103 braking the neutron star rotation . above the acceleration region ,",
    "the energy flux is predominantly transported by the poynting vector ( hatched arrows ) . ]",
    "thus , the problem of the magnitude of potential difference is solved quite easily .",
    "but the problem of the load that determines the current @xmath104 and , hence , the energy losses , proved much more difficult . a long way had to be covered in order to solve it , and this , essentially , will be discussed in this review .",
    "nevertheless , we shall go somewhat ahead and give here the preliminary estimates confirming the applicability of the discussed mechanism . as shown below , a good estimate of the electric current density is given by the expression @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the electric charge density that is needed for the electric field in the rotating reference frame to vanish .",
    "formula ( 9 ) can be easily derived from relation ( 4 ) .",
    "it was first applied to the neutron star magnetosphere in the pioneering paper by p goldreich and w h julian [ 3 ] , so the charge density ( 9 ) is usually called the goldreich density .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table5_02 ]    * acknowledgments",
