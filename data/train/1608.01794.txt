    "one of the fundamental features of quantum theory is that not all observables are jointly measurable .",
    "this observation goes back to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle and bohr s notion of complementarity , and has since then been studied extensively .",
    "two observables that do not have a joint measurement are called incompatible .",
    "recently incompatibility of observables has been formulated in general operational theories @xcite , @xcite , hence opening the possibility to compare features of incompatibility in quantum theory to other operational theories .",
    "interestingly , quantum theory contains maximally incompatible pairs of observables , but only in an infinite dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "there appear to be diverse aspects of quantum incompatible that urge for further investigation .",
    "incompatibility can be defined not only for observables but also for other types of devices @xcite , @xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the incompatibility of quantum channels .",
    "we show that the notion of compatibility reduces to the joint measurability if channels are of the measurement form , hence the definition is , indeed , a natural generalization of joint measurability of quantum observables .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the compatibility relation is linked to the concatenation of devices .",
    "we develop this idea further and characterize the compatibility relation on channels in terms of concatenation and conjugation .",
    "as we will demonstrate , several phenomena , such as impossibility of universal broadcasting @xcite and measurement disturbance @xcite appear naturally in this framework and have straightforward derivations after couple of general structural theorems .",
    "we will also explain the connection of the incompatibility of quantum channels to entanglement breaking channels @xcite , quantum shared broadcasting @xcite and antidegradable channels @xcite .",
    "further , the introduced framework allows us to generalize the notion of incompatibility breaking channels @xcite .",
    "this paper is an independent work , but can be also taken as a more mathematical companion to the recent review paper @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , the central aim in this paper is to show the broad applicability of the concepts of compatibility and incompatibility , and reveal their many connections to various features of quantum information processing .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : channels ] we recall the relevant basic concepts , including the concatenation preorder of quantum channels . in sec .",
    "[ sec : incompatibility ] we formulate the incompatibility of a pair of channels and study its consequences .",

    "[ sec : more ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : special ] we show how certain special classes of channels can be characterized in terms of their compatibility properties .",
    "this section will introduce the notation and recall the needed basic results on channels and observables .",
    "we will restrict to finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the vector space of linear operators on a hilbert space @xmath1 , and by @xmath2 the states on @xmath1 , i.e. , positive operators of trace one .",

    "quantum channel _ is a completely positive linear map @xmath4 that is unital , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "this mathematical description is the heisenberg picture of a quantum channel and will be the most suitable for our investigation .",
    "the physical meaning of a channel @xmath6 is , perhaps , more evident when we look at its dual action on states .",

    "a channel @xmath11 is fully specified by its action on the set of states , so we often write it as a map on states to further emphasize the use of the schrdinger picture .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath12 in the superscript to denote the schrdinger picture of a channel .",
    "we will denote by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the input and output hilbert spaces in the schrdinger picture , respectively .",
    "the output space @xmath14 can be different from the input space @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , a channel that adds another system in a fixed state @xmath15 , i.e. , the map @xmath16 is a valid channel .",
    "we will mostly focus on channels that have the same fixed input space @xmath13 but arbitrary ( finite dimensional ) output space .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 this set of channels .",
    "one can think this as the set of all operations that can be performed on the input system @xmath13 .",
    "a _ quantum observable _ is commonly described as a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "we will assume that there are finite number of possible measurement outcomes , so it is possible and convenient to define an observable as a function @xmath18 from a finite set of measurement outcomes @xmath19 to the set of positive operators on an input hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "this function must satisfy the normalization constraint @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the identity operator on @xmath13 .",

    "we denote by @xmath25 the set of all observables on @xmath13",
    ".    we will write and think of an observable as a special kind of channel .",

    "the essential point is that orthogonal pure states are perfectly distinguishable , so the measurement outcome distribution can be recovered from the output state @xmath44 .",

    ". then the functional composition @xmath48 is defined and it is a channel from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "physically the composition corresponds to a sequential implementation of these two channels and we call the new channel a _ concatenation _ of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    for two channels @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we denote @xmath53 if @xmath54 for some channel @xmath55 .",
    "we also denote @xmath56 if both @xmath53 and @xmath57 hold .",

    "the following are equivalent :    a.   @xmath66 b.   @xmath65 is a post - processing of @xmath39 , i.e. , there is a stochastic matrix @xmath67 such that @xmath68    ( i)@xmath69(ii ) : by the assumption there exists a channel @xmath55 such that @xmath70 . for each @xmath71 , @xmath72",

    "if @xmath39 is an observable and @xmath6 is a channel , then we denote by @xmath79 the observable defined as @xmath80 hence , @xmath81 .",
    "while the concatenation corresponds to a sequential implementation of two channels , we can also implement two channels in parallel .",
