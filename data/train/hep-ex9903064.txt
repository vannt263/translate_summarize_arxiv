    "detailed understanding of the resonant structure of orbitally excited b mesons provides important information regarding the underlying theory .",
    "a symmetry ( heavy quark symmetry ) arises from the fact that the mass of the @xmath10 quark is large relative to @xmath11 . in this approximation ,",
    "the spin of the heavy quark ( @xmath12 ) is conserved independently of the total angular momentum ( @xmath13 ) of the light quark .",
    "excitation energy levels are thus degenerate doublets in total spin and can be expressed in terms of the spin - parity of the meson @xmath14 and the total spin of the light quark @xmath15 .",
    "corrections to this symmetry are a series expansion in powers of @xmath16@xcite , calculable in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the @xmath17 mesons , for which @xmath9 , have two possible spin states : a pseudo - scalar @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and a vector @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "if the spin of the heavy quark is conserved independently , the relative production rate of these states is @xmath22 .",
    "recent measurements of this rate for the @xmath23 system @xcite agree well with this ratio .    in the case of orbitally excited @xmath5 mesons , two sets of degenerate doublets are expected : one corresponding to @xmath9 and the other to @xmath7 .",
    "their relative production rates follow from spin state counting ( @xmath24 states )",
    ". rules for the decay of these states to the @xmath25 states are determined by spin - parity conservation  @xcite .",
    "for the dominant two - body decays , the @xmath9 states can decay via an @xmath17 transition ( s - wave ) and their decay widths are expected to be broad in comparison to those of the @xmath7 states which must decay via an @xmath26 transition ( d - wave ) .",
    "table  [ tab : decays ] presents the nomenclature of the various spin states for @xmath5 @xmath23 mesons containing either a @xmath27 or @xmath28 quark , with the predicted production rates and two - body decay modes .",
    "several models , based on hqet and on the charmed @xmath5 meson data , have made predictions for the masses and widths of orbitally excited @xmath23 mesons .",
    "some of these models  @xcite place the average mass of the @xmath7 states above that of the @xmath9 states , while others  @xcite predict the opposite ( `` spin - orbit inversion '' ) .",
