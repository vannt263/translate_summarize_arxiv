    "the first nucleus to exhibit ` real ' nuclear properties is the three - body nucleus .",
    "there are only two stable @xmath14 nuclei , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; neither member of this isospin doublet has any known excited state .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0 has one proton and two spin - paired neutrons , while that of @xmath1 has one neutron and two spin - paired protons .",
    "we refer to the neutrons in @xmath0 and the protons in @xmath1 as the ` even ' nucleons , and to their _ rms _ radii as the even radii for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the proton in @xmath0 and the neutron in @xmath1 are called ` odd ' nucleons and their _ rms _ radii shall be referred to as odd radii  @xcite .",
    "charge symmetry requires that , in the absence of coulomb effects and mass differences , these nuclei be identical .",
    "this is because @xmath0 and @xmath1 are mirror nuclei and are related by a @xmath15 rotation in isospin space , or to put it more simply , one nucleus changes into the other by interchange of neutrons and protons .",
    "there are four interactions available between the two charged pions and @xmath0 and @xmath1 target nuclei .",
    "these are grouped conveniently in ` isospin ' pairs @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 which in turn are related to each other by the interchange of protons with neutrons and @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "_ in the absence of the coulomb force",
    "_ , if the strong interaction is charge symmetric , scattering cross sections for the members of each of these pairs should be equal .",
    "if we make the assumption that an incident pion interacts with a single target nucleon , then we can look at these interactions in terms of @xmath4-nucleon scattering amplitudes . at 180  mev ( near the peak of the @xmath22 resonance ) the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) scattering amplitude is about three times as large as the @xmath25 ( @xmath26 . ) consequently , the elastic cross sections for @xmath27 and @xmath28 are nine times as large as those for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath4-n scattering amplitudes can be broken down into _ spin - flip _ and _ non - spin - flip _ components . for a fixed target nucleon and pions of 180  mev ,",
    "the _ spin - flip _ amplitude has a sine dependence on the scattering angle ; the _ non - spin - flip _ amplitude has a cosine dependence .",
    "since no excited states are available , single _ spin - flip _ scattering from one of the even nucleons would leave both nucleons with the same spin and is thus forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussion on this point . )",
    "however , at the large scattering angles @xmath31 for which our most recent data were obtained , kinematic considerations require that one consider double- or multiple - scattering effects",
    ". this would open the door to double spin - flip scattering in the even nucleons which would not violate the pauli principle .",
    "the description of the whole picture is discussed in the accompanying article of kudryavtsev _ et al . _",
    "pion - nuclear amplitudes , discussed in  @xcite , are a superposition of a single- and double - scattering of pions from the nucleons in the nucleus with fermi motion taken into account .",
    "principal sources of the violation of charge symmetry in  @xcite are ( i ) the coulomb interaction between the charged pions and the nuclei ( the external coulomb effect ) , ( ii ) n - p doublet and the mass splitting of the different charged states of the @xmath32-isobar , and ( iii ) the difference between the wave functions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 due to the additional coulomb repulsion between the two protons in the @xmath34 nucleus ( the internal coulomb effect . )",
    "several ratios of scattering cross sections have been defined in conjunction with our earlier measurements  @xcite in order to highlight certain features of the @xmath35 interaction .",
    "the first two are the _ charge - symmetric _ ratios @xmath36 and @xmath37 the numerator and denominator of each pair are related by an exchange of protons with neutrons and @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the strong interactions in the denominator and numerator are equal , and these ratios should be identically one at all energies and four - momentum transfers squared . however , since the form factor of @xmath1 is decreased owing to the coulomb repulsion between its protons , the cross section in the denominator is reduced and we expect that the ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 will be somewhat greater than one  @xcite . in @xmath38 ,",
    "scattering from the odd nucleon dominates in the delta energy region , and so the scattering is a mixture of spin - flip and non - spin - flip . in @xmath39 , scattering from the even nucleon dominates , and so spin - flip scattering is suppressed .",
    "the next ratio is @xmath13 , the `` superratio . ''",
    "it is defined as the product of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 since @xmath38 and @xmath39 are charge symmetric , so is @xmath13 .    finally , we define @xmath41 and @xmath42 these ratios are not charge symmetric , but , as shall be seen below",

    "we see that @xmath38 is flat and structureless in the forward hemisphere but rises in the backward hemisphere where it remains high to @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 shows structure at about @xmath70 in the forward hemisphere , approaches 1.0 in the backward hemisphere and stays there to @xmath15 .",

    "we note that , aside from the region near @xmath71 in the @xmath72 center - of - mass kinematics , which corresponds to @xmath73 in the @xmath74 center of mass where the non - spin - flip scattering amplitudes have zeros , the charge - symmetric scattering ratios do not have any sharp features . indeed ,",
    "in the backward hemisphere they are fairly flat and quite smooth .",
    "this is not surprising , since the @xmath4-nucleon amplitudes are smooth and have no zeros in this region .",
    "the form factors for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as measured with electron scattering , are smooth as well . finally , the interactions in the numerator and denominator for each ratio are approximately the same : primarily odd - nucleon in @xmath38 , and primarily even - nucleon in @xmath39 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the qualitative behavior of the simple ratios , including the crossover , were predicted by an optical - model calculation by gibbs and gibson  @xcite before the back - angle data were taken .",
    "one might speculate that as one passes to the backward hemisphere , with the diminishing importance of the single - scattering process , the double - scattering process provides a mechanism for spin - flip amplitudes to contribute in paired - nucleon scattering without violating the pauli exclusion principle . in the top plot of fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : rprm ] shows results for @xmath43  and @xmath66 .",
    "these ratios have very small error bars , owing to the cancellation of normalization quantities mentioned above .",
    "the steep rise of @xmath66 and the fall below one of @xmath43 are indications that there is a steep rise in the 180-mev even - nucleon - dominated cross sections at large angles   @xcite . however , the error bars for these ratios are much smaller than those for the cross sections .",
    "these ratios are the most sensitive test of the large - angle scattering calculations ; in particular , these test the form factors used in the calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig : superratio ] shows @xmath13  at 180  mev .",
    "the shape is derived from the two simple ratios , the bump at @xmath70 corresponding to the bump in @xmath39 and the steady rise in the backward hemisphere to the rise in @xmath38 .",

    "@xcite and by gibbs and gibson  @xcite . in the latter the shape of the superratio was used to extract differences in the odd and even nucleon radii more precisely than is possible from existing electron scattering data .",
    "gibbs and gibson s optical - model calculation shows a strong dependence on two parameters , the difference between the _ rms _ neutron radius in tritium and the _ rms _ proton radius in @xmath1 ( that is , the difference in the even - nucleon radii ) , and the difference between the _ rms _ proton radius in @xmath0 and the _ rms _ neutron radius in @xmath1 . in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , a successful description of @xmath13 at t@xmath77 = 180  mev is based not only on the difference in the wave functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but also on the @xmath32 mass splitting as well as on the inclusion of the double - scattering interaction of the pion with nucleons of the target nuclei . both models account for the role reversal of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 at back angles for the @xmath80 = 180  mev",
    ". however , kudryavtsev _ et al .",
    "_ fitted @xmath78 and @xmath79 to determine r , while gibbs and gibson fitted their calculations to r and inferred @xmath78 and @xmath79 prior to the time that the data were obtained .",
    "although the leading terms included in the calculation of kudryavtsev _ et al .",
    "_ reproduce the main features of the back - angle ratios at energies of 180 mev and above , yet another factor which might contribute to this remarkable role reversal of @xmath78 and @xmath79 at back angles is a two - step process consisting of the formation of a virtual delta by the interaction of the incident pion with a nucleon , followed by the scattering of this delta on the remaining correlated nucleon pair .",
    "this process is clearly overshadowed by single scattering at angles near the non - spin - flip dip , but , like any two - step process , could become important as the momentum transfer increases .    for @xmath78",
    ", the dominant channels for delta formation would be @xmath81 in the numerator and @xmath82 in the denominator , whereas the reverse would be the case for @xmath79 .",
    "[ for @xmath78 the correlated pairs would be ( nn ) in the numerator and ( pp ) in the denominator , and for @xmath79 they would be ( np ) pairs in both numerator and denominator . ] since the width of the @xmath83 is somewhat smaller than that of the @xmath84 ( about 5 mev out of a total width of about 120 mev ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the lifetime of the former would be longer than that of the latter , and likewise its interaction cross section with the ( nn ) pair would be larger .",
    "thus , at back angles , where this effect might become increasingly important , it would have the effect of increasing @xmath78 and decreasing @xmath79 , which corresponds to their observed behavior .",

    "[ fig : r1r2back ] one can conclude that , since @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath13 , coming from different energy sets , fall on top of each other and follow the same general trend , these ratios are primarily functions of @xmath12 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath43  and @xmath66 at the largest scattering angles versus @xmath86 can be analyzed with the help of table 1 . as is seen in the table",
    ", @xmath87 decreases sharply from 142 to 180  mev , then rises slightly through 220 and 256  mev .",
    "@xmath66 shows the opposite behavior , with a maximum at 180  mev .",
    "the excitation functions for @xmath43  and @xmath88 for backward angles versus @xmath12 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1rho2back ] . as is the case for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and r ,",
    "the agreement of the overlaid data at different energies is also quite good .",
    "we note that in the forward hemisphere , a model that assumes single @xmath74 scattering explains the behavior of elastic @xmath72 scattering quite nicely , and the reaction is completely defined by @xmath72 kinematics .",
    "however , for angles greater than @xmath89 , kinematic considerations force us to consider two - step processes , especially double scattering to explain @xmath72 elastic scattering and all of the ratios are seen to be smooth functions of the momentum transfer .",
    "several new measurements of the ratios @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath13 at energies @xmath86 = 142 , 180 , 220 , and 256  mev at backward scattering angles are presented .",
    "these data complete our previous data sets at smaller angles and the same energies  @xcite . where data sets overlap they are consistent with each other . at @xmath90 , the charge - symmetric ratios @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath13 are smooth functions of the scattering angle in the backward hemisphere . the ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 cross each other at around @xmath91 ; @xmath38 becomes significantly different from 1.00 at backward angles while @xmath79 , which had been greater than 1.00 at forward angles , approaches unity .",
    "deviation of the ratios @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath13 from unity gives evidence for charge - symmetry - violation effects in these reactions .",
    "all three ratios , at energies of 180 , 220 , and 256  mev , are well described by the theoretical approach of ref .",
    "additionally , the ratios at 180 mev match well with the results of a previous calculation  @xcite that determines the value of the difference between the even and odd radii of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "it also has been shown that all three ratios @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath13 ( as well as @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) at large scattering angles ( @xmath85 ) and for all of the incident pion energies studied can be described as a function of only the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath12 in the region where two - step processes such as double scattering dominate the @xmath72 elastic scattering .",
