    "high resistive ( @xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 @xmath4 cm ) bakelite rpcs @xcite , prepared with a silicone compound coating on the inner electrode surfaces , were studied in a cosmic ray test bench to characterize its long term stability of operation @xcite .",
    "need for the silicone compound coating had been illustrated through the measurement of variation of efficiency with applied high voltage ( hv ) in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "study of variation of time resolution and cross - talk between neighbouring pick - up strips with applied hv were also reported earlier @xcite .",
    "such high resistive electrode - based rpcs are being explored as active elements of a large scale iron calorimeter for the proposed india - based neutrino observatory ( ino ) @xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of the streamer mode operation of high resistive bakelite rpcs is that the rate handling capability is relatively worse than that in the avalanche mode .",
    "for the same energetic particle falling on the rpc , the charge content contributing to the resulting pulses in the two modes differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "this , as well as the physical extent of the streamer and the electron avalanche , may result in variation of the pulse timing properties .",
    "these aspects need to be studied both through experiment and through simulation .",
    "stability of operation of the rpcs and its dependence on the detector parameters are the other important aspects which need to be studied in detail .",
    "it is established that a rough inner electrode surface of an rpc is prone to cause field emission , which is a source of high dark current @xcite . in this context , it is relevant to investigate the effect of surface roughness on the detector dynamics .",
    "it is conceivable that imperfections on the bakelite surface may be responsible to cause local non - uniformity of the electric field . depending upon their shape and size",
    ", they may often lead to discharge severely degrading the performance of the device .    in this article ,",
    "some experimental results on operation of our bakelite rpc in the avalanche mode , systematic studies and comparison of charge contents of the resulting pulses in the avalanche mode and the streamer mode operation of the same rpcs are reported . in our endeavor of corroboration of experimental results with simulation , preliminary results of numerical simulation of the effect of roughness of the resistive bakelites on the field configuration",
    "are also reported . using garfield - nebem @xcite code ,",
    "the field calculation has been done for several models designed on the basis of measurements of the bakelite surface profiles @xcite .",
    "all the rpcs were tested in a cosmic ray test bench described in ref .",
    "the cosmic ray telescope was constructed using three scintillators , two placed above the rpc and one below .",
    "triple coincidence of the signals , obtained from these three scintillators was used to select a cosmic ray event(master trigger ) .",
    "the signals obtained from the pick - up strips were put in coincidence with the master trigger obtained as above .",
    "this is referred to as the coincidence trigger .",
    "finally , the efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the coincidence trigger to the master trigger .",
    "premixed gas of argon , isobutane and tetrafluroethane(r-134a ) in the volume ratio of 55/7.5/37.5 ( equivalent to a mass mixing ratio of 34/7/59 ) was used in the streamer mode , while in the avalanche mode , r-134a / isobutane in 95/5 , r-134a / isobutane / sf@xmath5 in 95/4.5/0.5 and 95/2.5/2.5 volume mixing ratio were used . a typical flow rate of 0.4 ml per minute was maintained by the gas delivery system @xcite , resulting in @xmath1 3 changes of gas gap volume per day .",
    "charge content of the pulses were measured using a charge to digital converter , referred to as qdc . the set - up",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which is very similar to that used in ref .",
    "the master trigger gate of width 1.5 @xmath6s was also used as gate to the qdc .",
    "it was observed that the charge spectrum and the measured mean charge were independent of gate width over a range of 150 ns to 1.5 @xmath6s .",
    "the pulse height in the streamer mode was noted to be a few hundred mv , while that in the avalanche mode was found to be @xmath7  10 mv .",
    "a @xmath8 voltage pre - amplifier was used for the avalanche mode operation of the rpcs .",

    "in the avalanche mode , the rpcs were tested using different gas mixtures mentioned as above . the efficiency and time resolution of the rpcs",
    "were studied by varying the applied hv .",
    "the efficiency plateau was obtained at >  90% for all the gas mixtures , and it was found to be marginally higher for gas mixtures containing less amount of sf@xmath5 . at the plateau region , the time resolution was found to be @xmath1 2.5 ns(fwhm ) and the average signal arrival time decreased with the increase of hv , which is a common feature of any gas filled detector .    the charge spectrum of the rpc operated in the avalanche mode using the gas mixture of r-134a / isobutane / sf@xmath5 in 95/4.5/0.5 ratio , at two different high voltages.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    [ ]     the charge distribution spectrum in the streamer mode with a gas mixture of argon / isobutane / r-134a in 55/7.5/37.5 ratio.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in fig .",

    "is also shown in the same plot .",
    "it is clear that the fitted curve underpredicts the pulse charge content at the higher charge tail of the spectrum .",
    "this possibly indicates the onset of a breakdown mechanism responsible for the excess streamer charge beyond that can be predicted by the clustering model .    the induced charge as a function of the applied hv in the avalanche mode is shown in fig .  [ fig:4 ] , whereas that in the streamer mode is shown in fig .",

    "a preliminary calculation of the electric field to simulate the effect of surface roughness in bakelite rpc has been done as a proof of concept .",
    "the surface profile of the bakelite sheet ( grade p120 ) has been studied using a dektak 117 profilometer which sampled 2500 times over a small span of 5 cm at three arbitrary locations .",
    "[ fig : linfit ] shows the measurement taken at one of these locations where a least square fit has been done in order to define the baseline of the surface . in fig .",

    "[ fig : amplhist ] . it can be found that the maximum amplitudes of the roughness in positive ( upward ) and negative ( downward ) directions can be of the order of 4 @xmath6 m and 2 @xmath6 m , respectively .",
    "[ set3c]m.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for studying the effect of roughness , a device has been modeled following the geometry of an rpc .",
    "the device comprises of two bakelite slabs , each with thickness 2 mm ( in z - direction )",
    ". a gas layer of the same height is interposed between . a fine layer of graphite with thickness 20 @xmath6 m has been considered on other sides of the bakelites .",
    "the overall dimension of the rpc has been taken to be 5 mm ( in x - direction ) @xmath10 50 mm ( in y - direction ) .",
    "[ fig : rpcmodel ] depicts the model described above .",

    "two such structures have been introduced to represent the surface roughness with positive and negative amplitudes . for the preliminary calculation ,",
    "the shape of the roughness has been considered as a rectangular ridge stretched along the whole length of the device in y - direction , i.e. 50 mm , with height either 4 @xmath6 m ( in positive z - direction ) or 2 @xmath6 m ( in negative z - direction ) .",
    "the cross - section of the base of the ridge has been taken to be 50 @xmath6 m @xmath10 50 mm .",
    "the electric field ( z - component ) has been evaluated at several positions with respect to the top edge of the structure for the positive roughness as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fieldposrough ] . it can be noticed that a change of about 12% in the field value is possible within 1 @xmath6 m from the structure .",

    "the maximum change is about 5% at the closest vicinity of 1 @xmath6 m from the bakelite surface which is 3 @xmath6 m away from the base of the roughness ridge .",
    "it may inflate upto approximately 7 - 8% when studied at just 1 @xmath11 m above the base . here",

    "systematic studies on the performances of the silicone coated bakelite rpcs were performed both in the streamer and the avalanche mode .",

    "the measured induced charges on the rpc pick - up strips were found to be 1 - 2 pc in the avalanche mode , and @xmath1 100 pc in case of the streamer mode of operation .",
    "the preliminary calculation proves that the minute structures with straightforward shape on the bakelite surface do affect the field configuration by 5 - 12 % depending on its height or depth in its close proximity .",
    "it indicates that the structures with different shapes and sizes may be significant in distorting the nearby field configuration .",
