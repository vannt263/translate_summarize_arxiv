    "the chemically peculiar ap stars are a spectroscopic subclass of a - type stars which exhibit strong enhancements of one or more elements , notably cr , eu , si and sr @xcite .",
    "strong magnetic fields in ap stars were found by @xcite and their presence appears ubiquitous with field strengths reaching several kilogauss . as a group",
    "the ap stars rotate more slowly than normal a - type stars due to magnetic breaking and exhibit photometric and spectral variability due to inhomogeneous surface distributions of elemental abundances concentrated into spots by the magnetic field .    [ cols= \" > ,",
    "< , > , > , > , > , > , < , < \" , ]     the relatively large , and variable , scatter in the standard deviations of some of the abundances obtained is probably the result of the surface inhomogeneities and vertical stratification present in the atmosphere of this ap star .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis taking into account surface inhomogeneities and abundance stratification will be presented in niemczura , shulyak et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the mechanism responsible for exciting the oscillations observed in roap stars is still not fully understood .",
    "the opacity mechanism acting on the hydrogen ionization region leads to the excitation of high radial - order acoustic pulsations in models of cool ap stars with fully radiative envelopes , where convection is assumed to be suppressed by the strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been shown to provide a promising explanation for the observed pulsations in roap stars with pulsation frequencies below the acoustic cutoff @xcite . however , in a fraction of the known roap pulsators , the observed frequencies are too high to be driven in this way @xcite and an alternative mechanism needs to be considered , such as the effect of turbulent pressure suggested by @xcite and recently found to be a likely explanation for pulsations in an am star @xcite .",
    "the oscillation frequency observed in kic  4768731 is below the acoustic cutoff frequency derived from models covering the region of the hr diagram where the star is located . to check",
    "if the opacity mechanism can drive the observed pulsation , and further constrain the global parameters of the star , we carried out a linear , non - adiabatic stability analysis of a grid of models covering that region of the hr diagram .",
    "evolutionary tracks were produced with the mesa stellar evolution code @xcite for stellar masses in the range 1.62.4  m@xmath9 , in intervals of 0.05  m@xmath9 , and with initial mass fraction of hydrogen and helium of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "mixing beyond the convective core during the main - sequence has been considered , taking the convective overshoot parameter defined in @xcite ( their equation  ( 9 ) ) to be @xmath12 .",
    "only models with @xmath7 in the range 78508350  k were considered for the stability analysis ( vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_eq_po_t ] ) .",
    "the mass , luminosity , and effective temperature extracted from the mesa models were used to generate the equilibrium models necessary for the non - adiabatic computations .",
    "the non - adiabatic analysis followed closely that of @xcite , except that we have considered only their ` polar ' models ( models with fully radiative envelopes ) as these are the models in which roap - type pulsations are found to be driven by the opacity mechanism . following that work , for each set of mass , luminosity , and effective temperature , we have considered four different case studies . in the first ( or _ standard _ ) case the equilibrium model has a surface helium abundance of @xmath13 and an atmosphere that extends to a minimum optical depth of @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , in the pulsation analysis a fully reflective boundary condition is applied at the surface for this case study .",
    "the other three case studies are obtained by swapping these properties , one at the time to : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and a transmissive boundary condition .",
    "together , these four case studies cover the main uncertainties in the modelling .",
    "if modes with frequencies similar to that observed in kic4768731 are found unstable in at least one of the case studies , then the corresponding model parameter set is identified as unstable at the observed frequency .",

    "the solid lines are the evolutionary tracks ( starting from the zams ) covering masses from 1.6  m@xmath9 ( bottom ) to 2.4 ( top ) in steps of 0.05  m@xmath9 .",
    "the vertical dashed - lines indicate the range in temperatures searched .",
    "models found to be unstable at the observed frequency are marked by filled - circles . in the lower luminosity region , the modes excited are of low radial - order , while in the higher luminosity region they are of high radial - order . ]",
    "models found to be unstable at the observed frequency are marked by filled - circles in fig .",
    "[ fig_eq_po_t ] .",
    "inspection of this figure shows that there are two independent regions within the part of the hr diagram explored in which pulsations with the observed frequency are predicted to be excited . in the lower luminosity region ,",
    "the modes excited at the observed frequency are of low radial - order , characteristic of @xmath17-scuti stars , while in the higher luminosity region they are of high radial - order , characteristic of roap stars .    the non - adiabatic analysis performed here does not include the direct effect of the magnetic field on pulsations , but only its indirect effect through the suppression of convection in the stellar envelope .",
    "however , it is known from studies addressing the direct effect of the magnetic field that the coupling of acoustic and magnetic waves in the outer layers of roap stars leads to wave energy losses through the dissipation of acoustic waves in the atmosphere  @xcite and magnetic waves in the interior  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite has shown that energy losses through the latter process are particularly significant for low radial - order modes .",
    "these modes are then stabilised , explaining their absence in roap stars .",
    "if this is the case for kic4768731 , then the lower luminosity unstable region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_eq_po_t ] is likely to be spurious , resulting from the non - inclusion of the direct effect of the magnetic field on pulsations in the non - adiabatic computations .",
    "our non - adiabatic calculations thus point to kic4768731 being a relatively evolved and luminous star .",
    "given the identification of kic4768731 as an ap star , the pulsation is almost certainly of the roap type , and with a frequency of 61.45d@xmath0 ( corresponding to a period of 23.43min ) this star only just misses out on being the longest period roap star known ( hd177765 ; @xcite , 23.56min ) .",
    "other low - frequency roap stars , discovered from their low - amplitude radial velocity variations , include hd116114 ( 21min ) and @xmath18crb ( 16.2min ) @xcite .",
    "all four of these stars occupy a similar location in the hr diagram , around @xmath7 = 8000  k and @xmath8 = 4.0 , with kic4768731 having the shortest rotation period .",
    "spectral lines from rare earth elements are usually strong in ap stars @xcite .",
    "however , we find a distinct lack of significant overabundances in rare earth elements compared to those found in other roap stars of similar effective temperatures : hd177765 @xcite , hd116114 and @xmath18crb ( fig .",
    "[ fig_abunds ] ) .",
    "a similar conclusion was found for another , cooler , _ kepler _ roap star , kic10195926 @xcite .",
    "crb ( crosses ) .",
    "upper limits are indicated by downward pointing arrows .",
    "abundances are given relative to the solar values from . ]    the mg , si , cr , co , sr , and eu lines in kic4768631 show line strength variations in phase with rotation ",
    "they are strongest when the star is the brightest .",
    "the y and ba lines , on the other hand , vary in anti - phase with rotation ",
    "they are strongest when the star is the faintest .",
    "other elements , including ca and fe , show little variation with rotational phase or the results are inconclusive .",
    "the pulsation analysis has shown that the pulsation axis is in the same plane as the abundance spots that lead to rotational light maximum , but not completely aligned .",
    "the pulsations are coincident with light maximum , hence with srii maximum , and out of phase with yii maximum . where the pulsation axis , magnetic poles and spots are located is problematic , but they appear to lie in a single plane , which is consistent with the improved oblique pulsator model of .",
    "kic4768631 , however , is unusual in having pulsation maximum at maximum rotational brightness .",
    "many roap stars have pulsation maximum at rotational light minimum , which can be associated with strong rare earth element spots .",
    "it tends to be the slow rotators , with periods longer than one month , that have aligned rotation and magnetic axes , or the more evolved stars , since found essentially random angles of alignment for near - zams stars ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the former is ruled out by the 5.2d rotation period , but the latter case is a possibility since the non - adiabatic modelling suggests that the roap - type pulsations would be expected for the star nearer the terminal - age main - sequence ( tams ) than the zams .",
    "the luminosity , and hence age , of kic4768731 is , however , uncertain due to the lack of an independent distance determination .",
    "furthermore , ap(srcreu ) stars are supposed to take about half their main - sequence lifetime to develop their peculiarities @xcite , so the age is of interest . if abt is right , then perhaps this star is not old enough to have accumulated very anomalous rare earth elements .",
    "hence , kic4768731 may prove to be an interesting test case for the development of chemical peculiarities in ap stars .",
