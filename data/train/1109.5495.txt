    "were measured  @xcite . in his seminal paper",
    "@xcite , kane proposed an architecture for scalable quantum computation using nuclear spins of gated @xmath1p donors in silicon as qubits . with the superb compatibility with the existing silicon technology , kane s proposal and its variants have stimulated extensive interests in donor systems in silicon  @xcite , and remarkable technological progresses have since been made in various aspects .",
    "accurate positioning of the @xmath1p donor was made possible by controlled single - ion implantation  @xcite .",
    "local electrical tuning of the hyperfine interaction between donor electron and nuclear spins was demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "an architecture that integrates single @xmath1p donor with a silicon set was recently developed which enables high - sensitivity readout and control of the donor electron spin  @xcite . in the meantime , challenges still remain , e.g. on realizing efficient donor electron exchange coupling which is also needed for mediating pairwise interaction of nuclear spins  @xcite . due to the interference between the degenerate valleys of the electron , the exchange coupling strength vastly oscillates with sub - nanometer variation in donor position ( e.g. between 1 - 100 ghz when donor separation is @xmath3 nm )  @xcite .",
    "the chance to have an exchange coupling of @xmath4 ghz expected by the initial kane proposal becomes random unless with atomically precise dopant placement  @xcite which is beyond the technological capability today and in the near future .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a scheme to deterministically prepare dicke states of donor nuclear spins in silicon .",
    "dicke states in general refer to the common eigenstates of @xmath5 and @xmath6 with eigenvalues @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , where @xmath9 is the collective spin of an ensemble of @xmath10 spin-@xmath11 particles .",
    "dicke states with @xmath12 taking the maximum value @xmath13 are symmetric under permutation operations . when @xmath14 , symmetric dicke states are a class of genuine multipartite entangled states which have been widely pursued in atomic and optical systems as important resources for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "these states have the remarkable properties that the entanglement is robust against qubit loss and projective measurements on the states lead to various entangled states of a lower qubit number .",
    "@xcite when @xmath12 takes value other than @xmath13 , the dicke states are no longer symmetric under all permutation operations and will be referred here as asymmetric .",
    "asymmetric dicke states are also resources of genuine multipartite entanglement which are less studied for the lack of preparation schemes .",
    "the ideal resource for optimal quantum telecoloning algorithm is one such state with @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite preparation of asymmetric dicke states also makes it possible to access the decoherence free subsystems in the presence of collective decoherence  @xcite .",
    "the scheme we propose here can deterministically access all dicke states ( symmetric and asymmetric ) that span a complete basis for the hilbert space of @xmath10 spins .",
    "this direct access to the dicke - states basis can be an important complement to the circuit model quantum information processing , since the entanglement of these collective states can not be achieved in a simple way by pairwise interaction  @xcite .",
    "our scheme is based on cooperative pumping of nuclear spins by the coupled donor electrons , and the required controls are _ in situ _ to the prototype kane proposal : ( i ) initialization of electron spin to its ground state in magnetic field ; ( ii ) ac electrical control of the hyperfine coupling of the donor ( a - gate ) ; ( iii ) on and off switching of exchange coupling between neighboring electrons ( j - gate ) . remarkably , our scheme only needs a sub - gigahertz exchange coupling , which can be satisfied for almost all donor pairs with separation @xmath3 nm .",
    "hence it provides a practical way for generating the critical resource of multipartite entanglement of spins in silicon , which can tolerate the exchange oscillation problem and be realized within the current technology .",
    "our scheme is a significant example of the conceptually new approach of dissipative quantum state preparation with the advantages of robustness and no need for accurate temporal controls as compared to conventional state preparation by coherent evolution , as the desired dicke states all appear as the unique steady state under the various pumping scenarios .",
    "numerical simulation with realistic parameters for @xmath1p donors shows that dicke states of @xmath16 qubits can be prepared with high fidelity in the presence of decoherence and unwanted dynamics .",
    "the scheme also applies to other donor systems with larger nuclear spins such as @xmath17bi in silicon  @xcite .",

    "the a - gate tunes the hyperfine interaction @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being respectively the electron spin and nuclear spin of the @xmath21th donor .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath22 is proportional to the electron density at the donor nucleus site and hence is a function of the voltage applied to the a - gate which pulls the electron wavefunction away from the nucleus . with each a - gate independently controlled with voltage @xmath23 ,",
    "the hyperfine interaction becomes : @xmath24 where the first term is the static hyperfine coupling where @xmath25 mhz , and the second term is the ac hyperfine coupling from the voltage modulation . in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the off - diagonal part of the static hyperfine is far off resonance , hence it only results in small shifts of energy levels which are neglibile here .",
    "however , the off - diagonal part of the ac hyperfine can efficiently pump nuclear spin polarization when the modulation frequency @xmath26 is resonant to the electron - nuclear flip - flop transition  @xcite .",
    "the exchange coupling between neighboring donor electrons is tuned by the j - gate which can separate the electrons . when the electrons are decoupled , nuclear spins of different donors can be independently pumped to the fully polarized state ( i.e. nuclear spin initialization ) .",
    "when the electrons are coupled , nuclear spins can be cooperatively flipped by collective raising / lowering operators .",

    "we take @xmath144 khz and @xmath145 is the peak value of @xmath73 used . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in realistic systems , there also exist various defects in the surrounding of the donors such as the interface p@xmath146 centers .  @xcite the interplay between p@xmath146 centers and phosphorus electron spins is important in the presence of photo - excited electrons and holes .",
    "such interplay can facilitates the electrical detection of paramagnetic resonance of the donor electron  @xcite . in the absence of illumination as in our scenario , at temperature of @xmath147 , the p@xmath146 center as a mid - gap paramagnetic center",
    "can lead to statistical fluctuations of the electron - nuclear flip - flop resonances from donor to donor .",
    "furthermore , there could be noises from the local electrostatic environment , e.g. possible charge traps in the gate oxide  @xcite , which may affect the hyperfine coupling and the donor electron exchange as well .",
    "if the charge hopping is faster than the state preparation timescale , the effect of this dynamics noise shall be similar to the effect of spin decoherence analyzed above .",
    "it is also possible to interlace the pumping control with sequence of @xmath100 pulses applied to the spin qubits for dynamical decoupling from such noises .",
    "@xcite if charge hopping is much slower as compared to the state preparation timescale , the noises are static which also result in the statistical fluctuation of the hyperfine coupling strength and exchange coupling strength .",
    "to deal with such statistical fluctuations of system parameters , the system provides multi - fold individual tunability for each donor .",
    "the electron - nuclear flip - flop resonance depends on the static part of the hyperfine interaction ( see eq .",
    "( 2a ) ) which can be independently controlled by each a - gate .",
    "thus , in presence of inhomogeneous broadening of the electron - nuclear flip - flop resonances , the dc part of the a - gate voltage can tune the static part of the hyperfine coupling for compensating the inhomogeneity after calibration .",
    "as the excited state for the electron - nuclear flip - flop has an intrinsic broadening of @xmath78 , inhomogeneity in the flip - flop resonances is unimportant if it is less than this intrinsic level broadening .",
    "the exchange couplings between donor electrons are in general inhomogeneous due to the exchange oscillation problem and the possible effects of the aforementioned charge noises .",
    "this inhomogeneity manifests as nonuniform amplitudes @xmath148 in the electron excited state @xmath149 .",
    "we note that the pumping operators that cooperatively flips the nuclear spin qubits are of the form : @xmath150 ( see eq .",
    "( [ hoffdiag ] ) ) . while j - gate voltages can tune the exchange couplings and hence the values of @xmath148 , the ac modulation strength @xmath50 and phase @xmath49",
    "can further compensate the remaining inhomogeneity in @xmath151 .",
    "if only entanglement generation is of interest , our scheme can naturally cope with unknown systematic errors in the cooperative pumping . for controls aimed at the symmetric dicke state @xmath152",
    ", the nuclear spins may be flipped instead by @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are respectively the unknown phase and amplitude errors . in presence of these errors , the steady state is still a definite pure state @xmath156 with similar multipartite entanglement .",
    "this feature makes the requirement less stringent for implementing this scheme for entanglement generation .    moreover , one advantage of our scheme is unwanted donor sites can be easily disconnected in the state preparation .",
    "there are two ways to do this .",
    "one is to turn off the coupling of such donor site with others by the j - gate control .",
    "even if the exchange interaction couples all neighboring donor electron spins into collective states , the set of nuclear spins being pumped can be further selected by the ac voltage controls .",
    "if the voltage applied to one of these donors has no ac component , its nuclear spin will not be pumped and is effectively decoupled from the rest in the preparation process .",
    "this advantage allows one to select out the set of donors where the parameters are relatively uniform , and it also facilitates the realization of the concatenated preparation process described in fig .  4 .",
    "finally , we give an estimate on the scale of the dicke states that can be prepared using this approach .",
    "first , the detuning of the unwanted transitions is @xmath157 which scales inversely with the qubit number @xmath10 . to suppress the unwanted transitions , we require @xmath158 .",
    "second , the leakage due to qubit decoherence is @xmath131 , while the preparation time @xmath133 is determined by the smaller one of the modulation amplitude of the hyperfine interaction @xmath99 and the spin initialization rate @xmath78 . in our simulation , we take @xmath159 khz and @xmath160 khz , both values in the range reported in experiments @xcite .",
    "then @xmath10 shall not exceed @xmath161 by the first requirement mentioned above .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath10 set by the second requirement depends on the qubit decoherence rate @xmath132 . for given @xmath132 , the fidelity for state preparation in a block of @xmath10 qubits",
    "may be scaled from the numbers listed in table i. for example , with the nuclear spin decoherence rate of @xmath162 hz ( @xmath163 ms ) , preparation of asymmetric dicke state @xmath164 for @xmath165 qubits can have a fidelity over @xmath166 .",
