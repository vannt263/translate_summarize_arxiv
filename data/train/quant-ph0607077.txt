    "in the last decade , there has been a considerable growth of interest in single photon experiments in the visible or near infrared domain , mostly related to information storage , quantum computing and quantum cryptography . an essential element in these experiments",
    "is a single photon source named `` photon gun '' .",
    "it emits one and only one photon when the experimentalist `` pulls the trigger '' .",
    "faint laser pulses with extremely low mean photon numbers are only an approximation of single photon pulses .",
    "their state is close to a glauber state also containing two and more photons , and in the semiclassical description the laser pulse is modelled by a gaussian pulse .",
    "recently , several types of true single - photon sources were reported , which are based on the laser excitation of a single trapped ion or atom @xcite , a single organic dye molecule in a solvent @xcite,@xcite or a single nitrogen - vacancy color center in a diamond nanocrystal @xcite . a single - photon turnstile device that uses a single quantum dot or single quantum well",
    "was also proposed @xcite .",
    "such a photon is generated spontaneously from a single quantum object ( atom , molecule or quantum dot ) that is placed at time @xmath0 in an excited state by a short laser pulse or electronically by injecting a single electron and a single hole to annihilate in a light emitting domain ( a central quantum well in a p - n junction ) .",
    "single photon sources based on a single emitting particle can be divided in two kinds .",
    "a source of the first kind radiates in free space vacuum modes .",
    "for example , sources @xcite,@xcite and @xcite belong to the first kind .",
    "a source of the second kind radiates to a cavity mode .",
    "if a high - finesse cavity is used in a regime of strong coupling in cavity quantum electrodynamics , almost all radiation is collected in the active cavity mode and transferred through the cavity mirror ( loss channel ) in a well defined direction ( see proposals @xcite,@xcite based on the jaynes - commings model @xcite ) .",
    "this process can be made deterministic and it allows the generation of a single photon with a controlled waveform @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in a quantum network consisting of spatially separated nodes connected by quantum communication channels it is preferable to operate with photons having a shape symmetric in time @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that there is an additional physical argument demanding a time - symmetric photon wave packet if it is supposed to use such a photon in a atom - field interaction protocol for storage and retrieval of the radiation state .",
    "we consider a single photon source of the first kind , which intrinsically produces a photon with asymmetric temporal envelope because of causality .",
    "the resonant interaction of such a photon with an ensemble of two - level absorbers ( atoms , molecules , nuclei , etc . ) , referred to as a macroscopic absorber , is analyzed .",
    "we show that multiple scattering of the photon in the forward direction by the resonant particles displays unusual properties .",
    "they originate from the knowledge of the instant of time when the source particle was prepared in the excited state and then a photon was emitted , i.e. , when the `` trigger '' of the photon gun was pulled . in",
    "the semiclassical language one can say that the photon wave packet has a particular time envelope having properties that are very unusual and different from those known for bell - shaped pulses .",
    "we compare the atom - field interaction of such a photon with that for a photon wave packet with a gaussian time - envelope .",
    "then , for a photon source of the first kind we analyze the possibility to reshape the photon field envelope with the help of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) .",
    "the reshaped photon time envelope is close to the one with a gaussian envelope and its interaction with another absorber ( used , for example , for information storage or quantum computing ) becomes the usual one typical for bell - shaped pulses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the influence of causality on the spectrum of the single photon emitted by a source of the first kind and show that it introduces a broad part . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the propagation of such a photon in a thick resonant absorber . in sec .",
    "iv we study the photon filtering through a narrow eit window .",
    "we show that the narrow spectrum part of the photon and the broad part are separated in time .",
    "application of single photon filtering for quantum storage is discussed in sec .",
    "v. the conditions for level mixing induced transparency for gamma radiation are considered in sec .",
    "assume that at time @xmath0 a single particle ( generally a quantum object such as an atom , a molecule , a nucleus , etc . ) is placed in an excited state @xmath1 .",
    "if the radiation , emitted by this particle , has only natural lifetime broadening due to the coupling with the vacuum modes of free space , the radiation state is described by the usual expression @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a single - photon fock state of the mode @xmath4 with wave vector @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the location of the particle , @xmath7 is the frequency difference of the @xmath8-mode and the resonant transition from the excited state @xmath1 to the ground state @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the decay rate of the excited state @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling parameter of the radiation with the source is @xmath11 .",
    "this state is actually a wave packet consisting of many fock states and normalized such that in total it contains a single photon .",
    "let@xmath12 be the electric field operator containing only the annihilation operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the unit polarization vector , @xmath15 is a normalized amplitude of the mode @xmath5 .",
    "performing the sum over the wave vector @xmath5 in the expression for the single photon field @xmath16 , one obtains @xcite@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance from the source , @xmath19 is a normalized amplitude and @xmath20 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this wave packet has a sharply rising leading edge at @xmath21 and an exponentially decaying tail .",
    "the former is defined by the time @xmath0 at which the source is placed in the excited state and the latter specifies the coherence time or the mean correlation time of the photon @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "such a time dependence of the single - photon field was detected from radiation of a single organic dye molecule in solvents @xcite , in time delayed coincidence measurements ( tdcm ) of photons emitted in an atomic cascade ( optical domain ) @xcite and in a nuclear cascade ( gamma domain ) @xcite . a typical energy diagram and a detection scheme of tdcm",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "1(a , b ) .",
    "the delayed coincidence counting technique leads to the detailed observation of the time correlation between successively emitted photons @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the @xmath25 cascade .",
    "the photons of interest , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , can be selected by interference filters ( optical domain ) @xcite or these photons can be of very different energies such that different kind of detectors are used to detect them separately ( gamma domain ) @xcite . in the tdcm detection scheme the energy of these photons is converted by high - speed , high - gain photomultipliers to electric pulses , which are then amplified and sent to fast discriminators .",
    "a time - to - amplitude convertor is turned on by a pulse due to a @xmath23 photon and shut off by one due to a @xmath24 photon .",
    "actually it is the probability @xmath26 and not the complex probability amplitude @xmath24 which is measured .",
    "when a photon is detected at time @xmath27 , we have a collapse of the photon wave function at the detector place , which shows as a single count of the detector .",
    "after many events ( detector counts ) , one can reconstruct the actual time distribution of the probability @xmath28 .",
    "one can also extract information about the absolute value of the probability amplitude since @xmath29 .",
    "if we know that at time @xmath0 the source particle is placed in the excited state @xmath1 and there is no absorber between the source and the detector , this probability is zero for @xmath30 , it has a maximum , 1 , at @xmath31 and from then on it decreases exponentially .",
    "the time resolution of this measurement is defined by the response time of the detector and electronic circuit .",
    "therefore , the stepwise rise of the probability @xmath28 at @xmath32 is usually slightly smoothened .    for many applications",
    "it is important to know how a single photon field interacts with either a single absorber or an ensemble of quantum absorbers . in the time domain",
    "the propagation of such an asymmetric field through a thick absorptive medium was considered quantum mechanically @xcite and semiclassically @xcite for gamma photons and for small amplitude pulses in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "it was shown that if the source and the absorber have the same resonant frequency and the same linewidth , the transmitted probability amplitude is @xmath33 , where@xmath34 is the time envelope normalized to 1 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the local time , @xmath38 is the physical length of the macroscopic absorber , @xmath39 is its effective thickness , @xmath40 is the zero - order bessel function , and @xmath41 is the heaviside step function .",
    "in the definition of @xmath42 the parameter @xmath43 is the resonant absorption coefficient defined such that @xmath44 is beer s constant , where @xmath45 is the halfwidth of the absorption line for the absorber . for this particular case",
    "we take @xmath46 .",
    "the incident probability amplitude is assumed to be unity at the front face of the absorber ( @xmath47 ) for @xmath32 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1d ] ) the probability amplitude of the photon leaving a very thick sample ( @xmath48 ) in the forward direction is also close to unity for the leading pulse edge @xmath49 , the tail of the field being strongly absorbed and displaying an oscillatory behavior .",
    "this was experimentally detected for gamma photons in @xcite .",
    "the process was called speed - up of the initial decay and dynamical beat for longer times ( see , for example , the review @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the amplitude damping of the output radiation with increase of @xmath38 ( or @xmath42 ) does not follow beer s law and the time integrated intensity of this field decreases as @xmath50 @xcite instead of exponential decrease @xmath51 .",
    "this is consistent with absorption in frequency domain of gamma quanta in a thick resonant absorber , which is calculated for a radiation source with a lorentzian power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we argue below that the lack of absorption at @xmath49 results from the stepwise form of the initial part of the probability amplitude , i.e. , it results from causality . in a cascade emission of two photons , the time at which the intermediate excited state @xmath1 of the source particle is populated",
    "is known by detecting the first photon . from then on , and not earlier",
    ", the second photon can be emitted .",
    "implicit in this scheme is the assumption that the emission of the first photon projects the atom into the intermediate level with absolute certainty . in quantum mechanical language",
    ", we project the two - photon state ( produced in an atomic or nuclear cascade ) onto a single photon state by detecting the first photon .",
    "this detection ( the measurement ) introduces a broad part to the otherwise narrow spectrum of the second photon characterized by the lifetime of the intermediate level @xmath52 .",
    "a similar process in the photon gun of the first kind , i.e. , the pumping of a single particle by a short laser pulse to the upper state followed by fast nonradiative decay to a fluorescent state , introduces a broad part to the spectrum of a single photon emitted in free space vacuum modes .",
    "this is the price paid for pulling the trigger at a desired time , i.e. , for the knowledge of the time at which the excited state is populated .",
    "the time distribution of the detection probability of the photon emitted by the photon gun of the first kind looks similar to that observed by tdcm of photons emitted in an atomic or nuclear cascade ( compare , for example , the plots for the photon probability presented in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we give a brief outline of the methods used to treat the propagation of a single photon in a resonant absorber and introduce a decomposition of the photon spectrum ( produced by a single particle in free space ) in two components , one being a narrow and the other being broad .    for simplicity",
    "we consider the probability amplitude of the emitted photon @xmath53 normalized as @xmath54 .",
    "the propagation of a single photon in a thick absorber consisting of particles with the same resonant frequency @xmath55 and the same lifetime of the excited state as in the emitter is described by @xcite@xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fourier transform of the incident photon @xmath58 at the input @xmath47 and@xmath59 is the complex spectral function of the absorber . here",
    "@xmath45 is a half width of the absorption line of the individual particle and according to the imposed condition we have @xmath46 .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 , defined in the previous section , contains the concentration @xmath61 of the resonant particles in the absorber , the refractive index @xmath62 of the host in which these particles are incorporated , and the matrix element @xmath63 of the radiative transition @xmath64 .",
    "the expression ( [ eq21 ] ) was derived quantum mechanically by harris @xcite , who considered three - dimensional resonant multiple scattering of a gamma photon in the forward direction by nuclei residing in a solid without regular structure of their positions .",

    "the antisymmetric part almost does not interact with an atom while the symmetric part does . also , it is known ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the probability of excitation of an atom by a radiation field with a temporal duration much shorter than the decay time of the atomic coherence is defined by the pulse area .",
    "this area is zero for the antisymmetric part of the photon and it has a finite value for the symmetric part .",
    "thus , a photon emitted by a photon gun of the first kind has only a 50% chance to interact with a target atom and 50% chance to miss the target atom .",
    "such a poor score would make the use of a single photon source of the first kind in quantum computing or information storage unreliable .",
    "an experimentalist performing a measurement can not distinguish whether missing a target is the result of quantum statistics ( i.e. , the result of a small interaction probability ) or a purely quantum mechanical result originating from causality ( i.e. , the result of pulling the trigger , which leads to populating the noninteracting state @xmath263 ) .",
    "therefore , a qubit preparation in the form of matter excitation or any other operation with such a qubit using a single photon source of the first kind would become very uncertain and hence unreliable .",
    "however , filtering a single photon through an eit window may help to make it much more reliable for quantum computing and information storage . at the output of a thick eit filter , the broadband , @xmath263 , and narrowband , @xmath257 ,",
    "parts of the photon are well separated in time .",
    "the broadband part can be removed by time gating or a shutter and , for example , sent to an auxiliary channel .",

    "iv ) . sending the removed broadband part of the photon to a detector",
    "allows to purify the photon state .",
    "if the detector does not `` click '' , all probability amplitude is collected in a state that is a wave packet with a gaussian envelope@xmath265 if it clicks , no photon with a gaussian shape is present .",
    "such a detector in a purification scheme can be omitted , since what comes out of the eit filter with appropriate time gating is always the pure state ( [ eq53 ] ) .",
    "however , this auxiliary detector may help to conclude that the photon , emitted on demand , failed to pass through the eit filter and we have to repeat the operation .",
    "one could argue that filtering the radiation emitted by a single photon source reduces the total probability amplitude of the output photon while the interaction probability of such a photon with a target atom ( or atoms ) remains almost the same .",
    "so , what would be the gain and what would be the advantage of the eit filtering ?",
    "the gain comes from the removal of the broadband part , which does not interact with the target atom and hence produces a count at the detector placed behind the target . as such it is a false count carrying no information",
    "since the photon is assumed to be `` stored '' in the atom ( atoms ) , but it escapes the atom - field interaction due to the @xmath266-component .",
    "therefore , the false counts can be considered as noise in an information storage process .",
    "when applying filtering , this noise would reduce to zero , while with no filtering we have to compare the atom - field interaction probability with the quite high detection probability ( @xmath26750% ) given by the broad spectral component of the photon @xmath266 .",
    "a further narrowing of the symmetric part of the photon in the case @xmath268 works in the same way .",
    "we lose the `` brightness '' of the source or the detection probability , but gain in spectral resolution .",
    "actually we do not lose the `` useful '' energy if our aim is to improve the spectral resolution by sharpening the line associated to the source photon , i.e. , to make it more selective in the excitation of a particular target atom .",
    "selective excitation takes place if the spectral width of the source photon equals the spectral width of the absorption line of the selected atom and if their frequencies are in resonance .",
    "if our filter is designed such that these requirements for the output radiation are fulfilled , only the `` useful '' spectral content of the source photon is transmitted and the rest is suppressed . as a result ,",
    "the target atom interacts with such a photon with the same probability as in the case of no filter and the `` useful '' brightness of the source does not change .",
    "otherwise , with no filter the inherent broad part of the photon spectrum not interacting with the target atom ( atoms ) would produce a click at the detector placed behind the target showing that the atom - field interaction failed to happen .    to conclude this section , we consider the interaction of a gaussian shape photon with an ensemble of resonant atoms .",
    "we define the gaussian wave packet as @xmath269 normalized such that it contains only one photon .",

    "we have shown that a photon emitted by a single particle in free space contains spectrally narrow and broad components with equal probability amplitudes .",
    "the broad component has very low absorption in an ensemble of two - level absorbers or a single atom .",
    "therefore , a mapping of the state of such a photon in the form of matter excitation has @xmath26750% probability , which is low for any realistic protocol of quantum information storage and quantum computing .",
    "this is very different from what can be expected for a single photon with a gaussian time - envelope , which demonstrates a high probability of atom - field interaction .",
    "filtering out the broad component of the photon with the help of an eit medium may produce a single photon that is ( i ) spectrally narrow and ( ii ) of gaussian shape ( if @xmath296 ) in spite of an initially highly asymmetric time dependence of the probability amplitude of the photon coming from the source .",

    "for @xmath316 , the spontaneous generation of the stokes field changes to stimulated emission , introducing a time - asymmetry of the scattered field envelope . to reduce the spontaneous noise , it is important to work with the write laser producing a stokes photon with @xmath317 ( for example , @xmath318 ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite an additional phase matching condition @xmath319 , where @xmath320 , @xmath321 are wave vectors of the write and read laser fields , and @xmath322 , @xmath323 are wave vectors of stokes and anti - stokes photons , respectively , is applied to make the axis of the write - read laser beams different from the axis of the scattered stokes - anti - stokes photons .",
    "any stokes photon that does not satisfy the condition of raman resonance ( or phase matching condition ) and that , on the contrary , has the resonant frequency @xmath324 for the transition @xmath325 , will be spectrally broadened since it is produced due to spontaneous decay of the excited state @xmath299 of a single particle , and not collectively . in our paper",
    "we show that such a photon or a photon produced by a single particle decaying in free space vacuum modes interacts differently with two- and three - level atoms .",
    "therefore , the design of any quantum network should take into account the spectral properties of such a single photon and its interaction with atomic ensembles .",
