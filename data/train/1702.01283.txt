    "notice that the graphs in theorem  [ known].([t1 ] ) are comparability graphs since they are ( bull , house , odd - hole)-free  @xcite .",

    "the reduction is from @xmath2-subcoloring ( or equivalently @xmath12-coloring ) on triangle - free planar graphs with maximum degree 4 , which is np - complete by theorem  [ known].([t2 ] ) . from an instance graph @xmath6 of this problem",
    ", we construct a graph @xmath17 in @xmath16 .",
    "every vertex @xmath18 of @xmath6 is replaced by a copy @xmath19 of the vertex gadget @xmath20 depicted in figure  [ vv ] . for every edge @xmath21 of @xmath6 , we use two copies of the edge gadget @xmath22 depicted in figure  [ ee ] to connect @xmath23 and @xmath19 as follows :    * we identify the vertex @xmath24 of the first ( resp .",

    "it is easy to check that @xmath17 can be made planar and with maximum degree 4 .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 is ( @xmath4 , bull , house , gem , butterfly)-free . by removing the vertices",
    "whose neighborhood induces a @xmath1 , we obtain a bipartite graph .",
    "this shows that @xmath17 is odd - hole free .",
    "thus @xmath17 belongs to @xmath16 .",
    "let us show that @xmath17 is @xmath2-subcolorable if and only if @xmath6 is @xmath2-subcolorable . given a @xmath2-subcoloring of a graph",
    ", we say that a vertex @xmath33 is _ saturated _ if there exists a monochromatic edge @xmath34 and is unsaturated otherwise .",
    "we will need the following properties of @xmath22 :    1 .   in every @xmath2-subcoloring of @xmath35 , the vertices @xmath36 and @xmath37 get distinct colors and are saturated .",
    "[ p1 ] 2 .   in every @xmath2-subcoloring of @xmath38 , the vertices @xmath39 and @xmath40 get distinct colors and are not saturated .",

    ", exactly one vertex in @xmath41 is saturated .",
    "[ p4 ]    the six vertices labeled @xmath42 in @xmath20 are called _ ports_. using properties ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) , we obtain that every @xmath2-subcoloring of @xmath20 ( in colors red and blue ) forces the color of many vertices ( see figure  [ vv ] ) .",
    "in particular , all the ports in @xmath20 get the same color .",
    "this common color is said to be the color of @xmath19 corresponds to the color of @xmath18 in a @xmath2-subcoloring of @xmath6 .",
