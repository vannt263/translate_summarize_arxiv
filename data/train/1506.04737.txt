    "the hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic calculus @xcite provides a unified framework for modelling the dynamics of open quantum systems interacting with environment .",
    "the governing quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) are driven by a quantum counterpart of the classical wiener process which acts on a boson fock space and models a heat bath of external fields .",
    "an important feature of the qsdes is that their drift and dispersion terms are specified by the hamiltonian and coupling operators , which describe the energetics of the system and its interaction with the environment , and also involve a scattering matrix representing the photon exchange between the fields @xcite .",
    "these energy operators are usually functions ( for example , polynomials or weyl quantization integrals @xcite ) of the system variables , and the form of this dependence affects tractability of the resulting quantum system .",
    "in particular , quadratic hamiltonians and linear system - field coupling operators lead to a class of open quantum harmonic oscillators ( oqhos ) @xcite which play an important role in the linear quantum control theory @xcite .",
    "the linear dynamics of such systems are relatively well understood and are similar to the classical linear sdes in some regards , such as the preservation of gaussian nature of quantum states @xcite driven by vacuum fields .",
    "nevertheless , the coherent ( that is , measurement - free ) quantum analogue @xcite of the classical lqg control problem @xcite for oqhos is complicated by the physical realizability ( pr ) constraints on the state - space matrices of the fully quantum controller which come from the special structure of qsdes mentioned above .",
    "similar constraints are present in the coherent quantum filtering ( cqf ) problem @xcite .",
    "one of the existing approaches to the coherent quantum lqg ( cqlqg ) control and filtering problems employs the frechet derivatives of the lqg cost ( with respect to the state - space matrices subject to the pr constraints ) for obtaining the optimality conditions @xcite and for the numerical optimization @xcite .",
    "this approach takes into account the quantum nature of the underlying problem only through the pr constraints , being `` classical '' in all other respects , which has its own advantages from the viewpoint of well - developed optimization methods .",
    "however , a disadvantage of this approach lies in the fact that it is limited to certain parametric classes of linear controllers and filters . in particular",
    ", the resulting optimality conditions do not provide information on whether nonlinear quantum controllers or filters can outperform the linear ones for linear quantum plants .    in the present paper ,",
    "we outline a fully quantum variational technique which allows the sensitivity of the dynamic and output variables of a nonlinear quantum stochastic system to be investigated with respect to arbitrary ( that is , not only linear - quadratic ) perturbations of the hamiltonian and coupling operators .",
    "this approach is based on using a transverse hamiltonian , an auxiliary time - varying operator which encodes the propagation of such perturbations through the unitary system - field evolution .",
    "this leads to an infinitesimal perturbation formula for quantum averaged performance criteria ( such as the lqg cost functional ) which is applicable to the development of optimality conditions in coherent quantum control problems for larger classes of controllers and filters .",
    "in particular , this approach allows the sensitivity of oqhos with quadratic performance criteria to be studied with respect to general perturbations of the energy operators .",
    "in fact , the transverse hamiltonian method has already been employed in @xcite to establish local sufficiency of linear filters in the mean square optimal cqf problem @xcite for linear plants with respect to varying the energy operators of the filter along weyl operators @xcite .",
    "note that our approach is different from @xcite which develops a quantum hamilton - jacobi - bellman principle for a measurement - based quantum feedback control problem , where the role of state variables is played by the density operator .",
