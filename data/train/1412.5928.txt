    "the term `` magnetic hole '' ( mh ) was first used by turner et al.@xcite who identified large dips in the magnetic field amplitude in the solar wind , in an otherwise undisturbed background . for a subclass of such events ,",
    "sometimes described as `` linear , '' the magnetic field direction remains unchanged through the event . from solar wind observations ,",
    "these structures have sizes of tens to hundreds of proton thermal gyroradii , and are found predominantly in regions where the conditions are marginally mirror stable@xcite .",
    "similar mh structures , either as isolated events or as trains of structures , have now been observed across a wide range of plasma environments , in planetary magnetosheaths@xcite , cometary environments @xcite , the solar wind@xcite and in the heliosheath@xcite .",
    "the association of magnetic holes with regions of flow compression and enhanced perpendicular temperature anisotropy , such as the magnetosheath downstream of planetary bow shocks , indicates an association with the linear mirror instability with threshold @xmath0 , where @xmath1 .",
    "the mirror wave driven by this instability is non - propagating , has wavevector highly oblique to the magnetic field direction , is predominantly linearly polarized , and for high @xmath2 has a higher growth rate than the cyclotron anisotropy instability , which is the competing low frequency instability driven by a perpendicular temperature anisotropy@xcite .",
    "the observed sized of mh in the solar wind and planetary magnetosheaths corresponds to scales larger than proton thermal gyroradius , in agreement with the range of unstable wavelength found for the mirror instability@xcite .",
    "the development of nonlinear mirror structures to form magnetic holes has been the subject of several studies . in a high @xmath2 plasma",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the mirror instability can lead to the formation of both magnetic holes and peaks , depending on whether the plasma is linearly mirror stable or unstable ( respectively)@xcite . this appears to be tied to a bistability phenomenon , whereby nonlinear mirror structures which are magnetic holes can exist in a plasma which is below the mirror linear instability threshold .",
    "this behavior is found in both simulations@xcite and fluid models based on anisotropic mhd with a landau fluid closure@xcite .",
    "observations of magnetic holes in the solar wind and magnetosheath are consistent with them being non - propagating structures , such as mirror structures , but would be incompatible with dark soliton solutions of the hall - mhd system@xcite .    in the context of coherent nonlinear plasma structures , it is interesting to consider whether there can be magnetic holes at smaller , sub - proton scales .",
    "electron phase space holes have been long studied as examples of nonlinear solitary structures , either as solutions of the unmagnetized vlasov - maxwell system ( bgk waves)@xcite , the vlasov - poisson system@xcite , or using fluid models@xcite .",
    "these structures depend for their existence on particle trapping in the electrostatic potential of the wave .",
    "a model of magnetic structure associated with electron phase space holes has been proposed by treumann and baumjohann@xcite , in which an azimuthal electron current is driven by the @xmath3 drift , enhancing the magnetic field at the center and reducing it outside .",
    "simulations of the formation of electron phase space holes via the nonlinear evolution of the two stream instability@xcite also show evidence of magnetic perturbations associated with these structures .",
    "it is also possible to form magnetic structure at small scales , below the proton thermal gyroradius , via the electron mirror mode / field swelling instability@xcite .",
    "this instability occurs if the electron temperature is greater than the ion temperature , and requires a high perpendicular electron temperature anisotropy , @xmath4 . in some ways",
    "this instability is analogous to the mirror instability . a fluid approach based on electron - mhd",
    "has shown that soliton waves can be formed from the electron magnetosonic wave mode@xcite , providing a way to form one - dimensional electron - scale magnetic structures .    in this paper",
    "we describe magnetic holes at sub - proton scales which are seen to form in two - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of turbulent relaxation .",
    "the role of reconnection in the evolution of turbulence in these simulations has been discussed in a previous work@xcite .",
    "we develop a model for the coherent magnetic hole structures and demonstrate that they can exist in a uniform , stable plasma , given certain criteria for their formation .",
    "this indicates that they are a new type of coherent plasma structure , that may exist in a variety of plasma regimes .",
    "the magnetic holes found in the simulations are non - propagating , and have a circular cross - section , with a diamagnetic azimuthal current provided by a population of trapped electrons in petal - like orbits .",
    "there is a mean azimuthal electron velocity at the edge of the magnetic hole , and for this reason we use the term `` electron vortex magnetic hole '' ( evmh ) to describe them .",
    "they form out of magnetic field perturbations during the turbulent evolution of the simulation , and are associated with an increased perpendicular temperature anisotropy due to the trapped population .",
    "we show that the properties of evmh are similar to those of sub - proton scale magnetic holes observed in the terrestrial plasma sheet@xcite .",
    "this article will be split into four sections . in the following section ( section  [ sec : turb_sims ] ) we will describe the pic simulation of turbulence , and examine the properties of the magnetic holes that form within it . in section  [ sec : test_particle_sims ] we examine the composition of the diamagnetic current that sustains the evmh , by investigating the types of electron orbit possible within these structures using a test particle code , assuming static electric and magnetic fields . in section  [ sec : isolated_sims ] we will again use pic simulations to initialize these structures in a self - consistent model , in the absence of turbulence .",
    "in this section we describe the formation and properties of evmhs as found in pic simulations of turbulence .",
    "these simulations use the code parsek2d@xcite .",
    "this code uses the implicit moment method for time advance of the electromagnetic fields , and a predictor - corrector method for the particle mover .",
    "the implicit method allows larger time steps and box sizes compared with explicit pic methods , which are usually constrained ( for numerical stability ) by the condition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the time step , and @xmath7 is the electron plasma frequency .",

    "[ fig : eplusvxb ] we plot the parameter @xmath34 which in ideal , two - fluid mhd should be equal to zero .",

    "electron trajectories were calculated and recorded for a maximum of @xmath93 gyroperiods ( @xmath94 ) , or until the electron was @xmath95 away from the center of the hole , in order to reduce unnecessary calculation time for electrons that are not trapped and escape the hole .",

    "when an electron s @xmath96 is small , such that its gyroradius is considerably smaller than the mh radius , @xmath88 , then the mh only slightly deflects the electrons path and it does not become trapped . if an electrons position is outside the hole and its initial velocity is such that it gyrates away from the hole , then it will also not become trapped .",

    "this structure will only be stable if it is populated by electrons with a higher perpendicular temperature anisotropy that those outside the evmh .",

    "there is a dip in total pressure , @xmath71 in the region , resulting in increased values of @xmath2 within the hole .",
    "magnetic pressure is seen to dip below both the ion and electron pressure .",
    "off - diagonal terms of the pressure tensor are non - zero , and non - symmetric , and the pressure tensor rotated into the parallel and perpendicular directions shows non - gyrotropic behavior .",
    "particle vdfs show a maxwellian - like part of the distribution and an additional population of high @xmath96 current - carrying electrons , forming a plateau and extended tail in the distribution function .",
    "tracking particles confirms that these electrons are trapped within the hole , and trajectory plots show that they follow petal - shaped orbits .",
    "these orbits are the result of the reduced @xmath36 field in the region , and are similar to orbits produced by electrons drifting in a magnetic field gradient , where the field gradient here is circularly symmetric .",
    "an analysis of groups of particles from various parts of the vdfs confirmed that the higher - energy electrons were a group of trapped electrons , potentially responsible for the circular ring current in the region , as they collectively followed the circular form of the vortex as the mh drifted in space .",
    "test particle simulations were used to demonstrate the different types of trapped trajectories which are possible within a static , circular sinusoidal depletion in magnetic field . for an ensemble of test particles",
    "one can calculate the effective current and density that they would produce ( assuming some particle weighting ) . assuming the test particles have a maxwellian velocity distribution at some temperature , each type of orbit contributes to the instantaneous current with the evmh .",
    "we showed that these collectively form a ring - shaped current within the mh .",
    "the ring - shaped current has a diamagnetic effect , and can induce a similarly shaped magnetic field to the initial drop in @xmath36 , implying a solution to the vlasov equation might be possible in a self - consistent field model . using a statistically significant number of particles",
    ", we showed that @xmath131 of test particles become trapped , and that the probability of a particle being trapped was increasing with the magnitude of its velocity .",
    "we also showed that evmhs selectively trap electrons of a certain energy range , as the trapped electron distribution develops a peak for smaller hole radii .",
    "we also found that particles with pitch angles are most likely to be trapped within these structures , and a small increase in the electron density should be observed within the structure due to the overlapping orbits of the trapped electron population .",
    "we then showed that we can seed a stable evmh in a self - consistent pic simulation with a `` quiet '' plasma background , using a perturbation consisting of a circular drop in @xmath36 and increase in perpendicular electron temperature anisotropy within the hole .",
    "these results show that @xmath36 induced by these trapped electrons appears to reach a quasi - stable solution , at least on sub - proton timescales , so that an evmh can exist without the presence of turbulence .",
    "the trapped population of electrons within the mh generates a negative electrostatic potential , which attract ions into the region , allowing an increase in electron density and corresponding ion density increase .",
    "however , no negative potentials were seen in the holes within the turbulence simulations which suggests that this potential is not a necessary requirement for the stability of an evmh .    a recent survey in the earth s plasma sheet by @xcite showed that sub - proton scale mhs were common occurrences . the observed population had a range of sizes , with a peak in the frequency distribution at @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the ion thermal larmor radius .",
    "these events also showed an increase in electron energy flux at a pitch angle of @xmath134 inside the mhs , indicating that electron dynamics could play an important role in their formation .",
    "the simulated evmhs in this paper have a diameter of @xmath135 and are therefore consistent with their findings .",
    "the increase in electron flux is also consistent with the findings of section  [ sec : test_particle_sims ] that pitch angle particles are more likely to be trapped .",
    "a detailed multi - spacecraft analysis by @xcite of sub - proton - scale mhs in the plasma sheet shows that the @xcite observations closely match the predictions of evmhs as described in this paper , whilst ruling out many other formation theories . in future work",
    "we will investigate what factors determine the radius of an evmh , and how large they can be .",
    "we conclude that the evmhs described in this paper provide a theoretical model for the sub - proton - scale mhs seen in the terrestrial plasma sheet , and may also be applicable to sub - proton - scale magnetic holes observed elsewhere in the heliosphere .",
    "these coherent structures may also affect turbulence statistics , such as intermittency , at electron scales and could be relevant for many types of astrophysical plasmas .",
