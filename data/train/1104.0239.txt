    "throughout the modern history of nuclear and particle physics , measurements of structure functions in high - energy lepton - nucleon scattering have played a pivotal role .",
    "the demonstration of structure function scaling in early deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments at slac in the late 1960 s @xcite established the reality of quarks as elementary constituents of protons and neutrons  a feat recognized by the award of the 1990 nobel prize in physics to friedman , kendall and taylor .",
    "this paved the way to the development of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of strong nuclear interactions , and its subsequent confirmation several years later through the discovery of logarithmic scaling violations in structure functions @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of structure functions in terms of quark and gluon ( or parton ) momentum distributions resulted in the emergence of a remarkably simple and intuitive picture of the nucleon @xcite , allowing a vast amount of scattering data to be described in terms of a few universal functions  the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath1 structure function of the proton , for example , could be simply represented as a charge squared - weighted sum of pdfs , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the quark and antiquark momentum distribution functions , usually expressed as functions of the momentum fraction @xmath5 of the nucleon carried by the parton , at a scale given by the momentum transfer squared @xmath6 .    over the ensuing decades concerted experimental dis programs at slac , cern , desy and fermilab",
    "have provided a detailed mapping of the pdfs over a large range of kinematics , with @xmath6 and @xmath5 spanning several orders of magnitude . to manage the ever increasing number of data sets , from not only inclusive dis but also other high energy processes such as drell - yan , @xmath7-boson and jet production in hadronic collisions at fermilab , sophisticated global fitting efforts were developed @xcite that",
    "now include perturbative corrections calculated to next - to - leading order ( or higher ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath0 . with the increasing energies available at facilities such as the desy @xmath8 collider hera ( and in future the large hadron collider at cern ) , pdf studies turned their attention primarily to exploring the region of very small @xmath5 ( down to @xmath9 ) , where the structure of the nucleon is dominated by its sea quark and gluon distributions .",
    "however , while opening the door to exploration of phenomena such as saturation and @xmath6 evolution in new kinematic regimes , one can argue whether dis at low @xmath5 measures the intrinsic structure of the nucleon or the hadronic structure of the virtual photon , @xmath10 . because the virtual photon in the dis process can fluctuate into @xmath11 pairs",
    "whose coherence length @xmath12 becomes large at small @xmath5 , dis at @xmath13 really probes the @xmath14 interaction rather than the structure of the nucleon or the @xmath10 separately . at high @xmath5 , in contrast ,",
    "the virtual photon is point - like and unambiguously probes the structure of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "moreover , despite the impressive achievements over the past 4 decades , there are still some regions of kinematics where our knowledge of structure functions and pdfs remains unacceptably poor , with little progress made since the 1970 s .",
    "a striking example is the region of large @xmath5 ( @xmath15 ) , where most of the momentum is carried by valence quarks , and sea quarks and gluons are suppressed . here",
    "the valence quark pdfs can be more directly related to quark models of hadron structure ; however , the rapidly falling cross sections have made precision measurements extremely challenging .",
    "another example is the pre - asymptotic region dominated by nucleon resonances , where data on the individual transverse and longitudinal cross sections at intermediate and high values of @xmath6 are either nonexistent or have large uncertainties . with the availability of continuous , high luminosity electron beams at the cebaf accelerator ,",
    "the first decade of experiments at jefferson lab has seen a wealth of high - quality data on unpolarized structure functions of the nucleon , penetrating into the relatively unexplored large-@xmath5 domain and the transition region between resonances and scaling .    the new data in the resonance region confirmed in spectacular fashion the phenomenon of quark - hadron duality in the proton @xmath1 structure function , and revealed intriguing details about the workings of duality in a number of other observables .",
    "the impact of this has been a re - evaluation of the applicability of perturbative qcd to structure functions at low @xmath6 , and has allowed a much larger body of data to be used in global pdf analyses @xcite .",
    "jefferson lab has also set a new standard in the determination of rosenbluth - separated longitudinal and transverse structure functions , which eliminates the need for model - dependent assumptions that have plagued previous extractions of structure functions from cross section data .    on the theoretical front",
    ", the region of large @xmath5 and low @xmath6 brings to the fore a number of issues which complicate structure function analysis , such as @xmath16 suppressed target mass and higher twist corrections , and nuclear corrections when scattering from nuclear targets .",
    "controlling these corrections requires more sophisticated theoretical tools to be developed , and has motivated theoretical studies , many of which are still ongoing .",
    "it has also paved the way towards the 12  gev experimental program , in which structure functions will be measured to very high @xmath5 in the dis region , addressing some long - standing questions about the behavior of pdfs as @xmath17 .    in the next section",
    "we summarize the kinematics and formalism relevant for inclusive lepton  nucleon scattering , including the key results from the operator product expansion .",

    "because of the small value of the electromagnetic fine structure constant , @xmath22 , the inclusive scattering of an electron from a nucleon , @xmath23 , can usually be approximated by the exchange of a single virtual photon , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . in terms of the laboratory frame incident electron energy @xmath26 , the scattered electron energy @xmath27 , and the scattering angle @xmath28 , the photon virtuality is given by @xmath29 , where the electron mass has been neglected .",

    "one can also define a purely longitudinal structure function @xmath21 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ratio of longitudinal to transverse cross sections .",
    "the separation of the unpolarized structure functions into longitudinal and transverse parts from cross section measurements can be accomplished via the rosenbluth , or longitudinal - transverse ( lt ) , separation technique @xcite , by making measurements at two or more values of @xmath52 for fixed @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "fitting the reduced cross section @xmath53 linearly in @xmath52 yields @xmath43 ( and therefore @xmath39 ) as the intercept , while the ratio @xmath54 is obtained from the slope .",
    "note that @xmath1 can only be extracted from cross sections either by measuring at @xmath55 or by performing lt separations . at typical jefferson lab kinematics",
    "the contribution of @xmath21 to @xmath1 can be significant .",
    "the above discussion assumed the dominance of the one - photon exchange amplitude in describing the neutron current electron scattering cross section . in principle",
    "there are additional contributions arising from the exchange of a @xmath56 boson , and in particular the interference between @xmath10 and @xmath56 exchange .",
    "the interference is in fact very relevant for parity - violating electron scattering , discussed elsewhere in this volume in connection with extractions of strange electromagnetic form factors from parity - violating asymmetries .",
    "the theoretical basis for describing the @xmath6 dependence of structure functions in qcd is wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "the quantities most directly amenable to a qcd analysis are the _ moments _ of structure functions , the @xmath57-th moments of which are defined as @xmath58 as will become relevant in the discussion of duality in sec .",

    "are given in terms of matrix elements of spin-@xmath57 operators , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the quark field , @xmath68 is the covariant derivative , and the braces @xmath69 denote symmetrization of indices and subtraction of traces .",
    "the leading - twist terms correspond to diagrams such as in fig .  1  ( a ) , in which the virtual photon scatters incoherently from a single parton .",
    "the higher - twist terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnope ] ) are proportional to higher powers of @xmath16 whose coefficients are matrix elements of local operators involving multi - quark or quark - gluon fields , such as those depicted in fig .  1  ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the higher twists therefore parametrize long - distance multi - parton correlations , which can provide clues to the dynamics of quark confinement .",
    "the additional terms ( referred to as the `` trace terms '' ) in the twist - two matrix elements involve structures such as @xmath70 and are thus suppressed by powers of @xmath71 . while negligible in the bjorken limit , at finite @xmath6 these give rise to the so - called _ target mass corrections _ ( tmcs ) , and are important in the analysis of jefferson lab data at large values of @xmath5 . because their origin is in the same twist - two operators that give rise to structure function scaling , tmcs are formally twist - two effects and are kinematical in origin . inverting the expressions for the full moments including the trace terms , the resulting target mass corrected @xmath1 structure function in the ope",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the structure function in the @xmath74 limit .",

    "although at lo the scattering and particle production mechanisms are independent , higher order pqcd corrections give rise to non - factorizable terms , which involve convolutions of the pdfs and fragmentation functions with hard coefficient functions @xcite .    for hadrons produced collinearly with the virtual photon , the invariant mass @xmath126 of the undetected hadronic system @xmath30 at large @xmath6 can be written @xcite @xmath127 , where the hadron mass is neglected with respect to @xmath6 . in the elastic limit , @xmath128",
