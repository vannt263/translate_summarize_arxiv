    "in this paper we consider pattern formation problem in the developmental biology .",
    "mathematical approaches to this problem start with the seminal work by a. m. turing @xcite devoted to pattern formation from a spatially uniform state .",
    "turing s model is a system of two reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "after @xcite , similar phenomenological models were studied by numerous works ( see @xcite for the review ) .",
    "computer simulations based on this mathematical approach give patterns similar to really observed ones @xcite .",
    "however , there is no direct evidence of turing s patterning in any developing organism ( @xcite , p.347 ) . the mathematical models are often selected to be mathematically tractable and they do not take into account actual experimental genetic information .",
    "moreover , within the framework of the turing - meinhardt approach some important theoretical questions are left open .",
    "for example , whether there exist `` universal '' mathematical models and patterning algorithms that allow to obtain any , even very complicated , patterns .",
    "in fact , a difficulty in using of simple reaction - diffusion models with polynomial or rational nonlinearities is that we have no patterning algorithms . to obtain a given pattern ,",
    "first we choose a reasonable model ( often using intuitive ideas ) and later we adjust coefficients or nonlinear terms by numerical experiments ( an excellent example of this approach is given by the book of h. meinhardt on pigmentation in shells @xcite ) .    to overcome this algorithmic difficulty we use genetic circuit models .",
    "we are going to show that they can serve as `` universal models '' , which are capable to generate any spatio - temporal patterns by algorithms .",
    "the gene circuits were proposed and investigated by many works @xcite ( for the review see @xcite ) in order to use available genetic information , to take into account some fundamental properties of gene interaction and understand mechanisms of cell gene regulation .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the model from @xcite , which is similar to the well studied hopfield neural networks .",
    "this model describes activation or depression of one gene by another and have the following form :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the number of genes included in the circuit , @xmath2 are the concentration of the @xmath3-th protein , @xmath4 are the protein decay rates , @xmath5 are some positive coefficients and @xmath6 are the protein diffusion coefficients .",
    "we consider ( [ genemodel ] ) in some bounded domain @xmath7 with a boundary @xmath8 .",
    "the real number @xmath9 measures the influence of the @xmath10-th gene on the @xmath3-th one .",
    "the assumption that gene interactions can be expressed by a single real number per pair of genes is a simplification excluding complicated interactions between three , four and more genes .",
    "clearly such interactions are possible , however in this case the problem becomes mathematically much more complicated .",
    "since the pair interaction is capable to produce any patterns , it seems reasonable to restrict our consideration only to such interaction .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 are activation thresholds and @xmath12 is a monotone function satisfying the following assumptions @xmath13",
    "@xmath14    the well known example is @xmath15 .    the functions @xmath16 are other activation thresholds depending on @xmath17",
    ". they can be interpreted as densities of proteins associated with the maternal genes .",
    "this model takes into account only three fundamental processes : ( a ) decay of gene products ( the term @xmath18 ) ; ( b ) exchange of gene products between cells ( the term with @xmath19 ) and ( c ) gene regulation and protein synthesis .",
    "notice that this model of gene circuit can be considered as a hopfield s neural network @xcite with thresholds depending on @xmath17 and where diffusion is taken into account .",
    "the hopfield system is the first model of so - called attractor neural network , both fundamental and simple .",
    "analytical methods for the hopfield models were developed in @xcite .",
    "let us fix a function @xmath12 satisfying ( [ sigma1 ] ) , ( [ sigma2 ] ) and functions @xmath20 . on the contrary , we consider @xmath21 and @xmath11 as parameters to be adjusted .",
    "we denote the set of these parameters by @xmath22 : @xmath23    model ( [ genemodel ] ) allows to use data on gene regulation ( see @xcite , where the least square approximation of experimental data and simulated annealing were used to determine the values of the parameters @xmath22 ) .    in order to study ( [ genemodel ] ) , many previous works used numerical simulations . for example , the work @xcite is devoted to the segmentation in _ drosophila _ , in @xcite the authors analyse complex patterns occurring under a random choice of the coefficients @xmath9 .",
    "let us formulate now mathematically our main problem .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 . given a function @xmath26 $ ] and a positive number @xmath27 , to find the parameters @xmath22 such that the solution of system ( [ genemodel ] ) with initial conditions @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29.\\ ] ]",
    "let us consider a biological interpretation of this mathematical formulation .",
    "we assume that the cell states depend on expression of some genes ; we can thus identify observed patterns of cell differentiation with gene expression patterns . let us consider these expression patterns as continuous functions @xmath30 , where @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 .",
    "for example , we can assume that @xmath33 $ ] and if @xmath34 is close to @xmath35 , the gene is expressed otherwise the gene is not expressed .",
    "we consider gene circuits including a single `` output '' ( structural ) gene @xmath36 and @xmath37 `` hidden '' ( regulating ) genes .",
    "the output gene can change the cell states and therefore can predetermine an output pattern @xmath38 .",
    "the hidden genes do not influence directly the cell states , they are involved only in an internal cellular gene regulation .",
    "notice that given pattern @xmath38 can depend on time @xmath39 .",
    "this fact is important since real biological structures are usually dynamical . for stationary patterns @xmath38 ( independent of time )",
    "the solution of pattern problem is simple and follows from the well known results on neural networks ( see sect .  [ sec - aux ] ) .",
    "the main results can be described as follows .    *",
    "a ) * we show that , roughly speaking , any pattern formation process based on a reaction - diffusion model can be performed as well by a genetic network , with a sufficiently large number of the genes . for",
    "each reaction - diffusion model one can find an approximating gene network , with the almost same pattern formation capacity .",
    "this result justifies , to some extent , turing - meinhardt s models from a genetic point of view .",
    "indeed , these models can be considered as gene circuits .",
    "* b ) * the second result asserts that , under natural conditions on maternal genes densities @xmath20 , the universal pattern generation problem always has a solution .",
    "moreover , there is a constructive and numerically effective algorithm that allows us to find a circuit generating a given pattern .",
    "notice that this result is also valid in the absence of diffusion .",
    "indeed , in our approach , spatial signalling is not provided by the diffusion process , but by space - depending thresholds @xmath20 .",
    "our conditions on maternal gene concentration are necessary and sufficient : if they do not hold , it is not possible to approximate any patterns within an arbitrarily small error . on the contrary , if they are valid , it is possible .",
    "if we deal with one - dimensional case ( for example , we consider a differentiation along anterior - posterior axis ) , then our conditions mean existence of a morphogene gradient along this axis . for _ drosophila",
    "_ this morphogene is _",
    "bicoid_. so , we show that a simple bicoid gradient is capable to produce any chain of complicated time transformations leading to complex spatial one - dimensional patterns .",
    "this result is in an agreement with biological observations @xcite . to create any two - dimensional patterns , we need at least two independent gradients , along anterior - posterior and dorso - ventral axes .    *",
    "c ) * we show that the modular organisation and sigmoidal interaction are effective tools to form complex hierarchical patterns .",
    "indeed , we show that new , more refined structures , can be obtained by using of previous old structures .",
    "also we illustrate that existence of an old structure make it easier to produce a new complex one .",
    "this property might help to understand the usual idea `` morphogenesis repeats evolution '' @xcite , see sect .",
    "[ sec - prog ] and  [ sec - ccl ] .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we explain main biological and mathematical ideas beyond these results , in particular , we find connections with multilayered network theory and the hopfield model . in sect .",
    "[ sec - rd ] we describe the connection between the reaction - diffusion models and gene circuit systems . in sect .",
    "[ sec - prog ] we formulate mathematically pattern formation problem and describe main ideas of patterning algorithms .",
    "[ sec - num ] presents computer simulations illustrating our analytical results .",
    "in particular , as an illustration , we approximate numerically , by gene circuit , a reaction - diffusion system for pigmentation of sea shells proposed by @xcite .",
    "[ sec - ccl ] contains a discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "all complicated and tedious mathematical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "in this section we remind main ideas and results of neural network theory important below . to simplify our statement , we omit some non - essential mathematical details ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the neural networks usually consist of a large number of neurons .",
    "each neuron is connected to other neurons by directed links with their associated weights . after absorbing the inputs",
    ", each neuron produces its activation as an output signal to other neurons .",
    "each neuron sends a single signal to several neurons at the time .",
    "typical problems which may be solved by such nets are pattern classification , storing patterns and optimal control problems ( see @xcite ) .    the simplest example is a single - layer network having one layer of weights .",
    "the network consists of @xmath40 input neurons @xmath41 , @xmath42 and an output neuron @xmath43 .",
    "each @xmath41 is connected to @xmath43 with an associated weight @xmath44 .",
    "the output @xmath43 is given by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is a threshold and @xmath12 is a strictly monotone function satisfying ( [ sigma1 ] ) and ( [ sigma2 ] ) .",
    "network ( [ s - net ] ) can solve only simple classification problems .",
    "more powerful , a multilayer neural network with @xmath47 layers consists of one layer of input neurons , an output neuron and @xmath48 hidden layers . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the corresponding equations can be written for instance as @xmath50 @xmath51    where @xmath52 are states of the input neurons .",
    "the remarkable property of this network playing the key role in this paper is that any input - output map of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a continuous function , can be approximated by a network ( [ s1-net])([s2-net ] ) with a sufficiently large @xmath1 and appropriate weights @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we shall use below , for brevity , notation @xmath57 since @xmath12 is monotone , the assertion that network ( [ s1-net])([s2-net ] ) approximates any output , can be reformulated as follows : by the quantity @xmath58 we can approximate any function , within an arbitrarily small error . this fact results from the following well known assertion ( see , for example , the works @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider function @xmath59 of vector argument @xmath60 depending on the following parameters : the number @xmath61 , an @xmath62 matrix @xmath63 , and the vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this function is defined by @xmath66    we consider this function in a bounded ball @xmath67 , consisting of vectors @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath12 is monotone and satisfies conditions ( [ sigma1])([sigma2 ] ) , then for any continuous function @xmath70 defined in the ball @xmath67 and for any positive number @xmath71 , there exist a number @xmath72 , matrices @xmath63 and @xmath1-vector @xmath73 and @xmath64 such that @xmath74    in other words , given pattern @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we can always find weights @xmath77 and @xmath78 such that the output of network ( [ s1-net])([s2-net ] ) approximates this pattern , up to precision @xmath27 .",
    "[ approxlemma ]    approximation ( [ approx ] ) can be obtained by the multilayered network theory ( see @xcite ) or by an application of wavelet type extensions @xcite .",
    "for wavelet theory see @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the approximations by ( [ psi ] ) are numerically effective as the dimension @xmath40 of the vector @xmath68 increases .",
    "we know constructive algorithms allowing to adjust the parameters @xmath79 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "notice that the number @xmath1 of the coefficients @xmath64 depends polynomially on `` complexity '' of the pattern @xmath75 and the precision @xmath27 .",
    "more `` complex '' the pattern , greater @xmath1 .",
    "this complexity can be measured by the integral @xcite @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath75 .",
    "this means that more oscillating functions ( patterns ) have larger complexities .",
    "the hopfield network @xcite is a system of coupled oscillators defined by the differential equations @xmath82    here @xmath83 are neuron states depending on time , @xmath9 is a matrix determining a neuron interaction ( synaptic matrix ) , @xmath11 are thresholds .",
    "genetic model ( [ genemodel ] ) can be considered as a generalisation of the hopfield system such that the neuron states and the thresholds depend on a space variable @xmath17 and the diffusion is taken into account .",
    "we are going to apply some methods developed to investigate attractors of the hopfield neural networks .",
    "we recall that dynamics ( [ hopfmodel ] ) is dissipative and thus an attractor always exists ( on the attractor theory see publications @xcite among many others ) .",
    "dynamics of ( [ hopfmodel ] ) sharply depends on the synaptic matrix @xmath84 .",
    "if the matrix @xmath84 is symmetric , the attractor usually consists of many equilibria .",
    "such stable large time behaviour can be applied to the pattern recognition and associative memory problems .",
    "the large time behaviour of @xmath85 can become very complex if @xmath84 is non - symmetric .",
    "for instance , depending on @xmath84 , neuron states can form complicated coherent structures that evolve periodically or even chaotically in time .",
    "these coherent patterns can be described as follows .",
    "any ( symmetrical or non - symmetrical ) @xmath86 matrix @xmath84 of rank @xmath40 can be represented as a product of two matrices @xmath77 and @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath88 where @xmath77 has size @xmath62 and @xmath87 has size @xmath89 ,    let us introduce the new variables @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the dynamical equations for @xmath68 have the following form @xmath92 where @xmath93 are defined by equations similar to ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "time evolution of the new variables @xmath94 controls the dynamics of all the neuron states @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath95    the functions @xmath96 can be expressed through @xmath97 in a simple way by linear equations ( [ y - q ] ) .    below we will use new control parameters @xmath98 , we denote @xmath99 fixing @xmath100 .",
    "let us formulate now the following assertion ( analogous to the results of @xcite ) describing the complexity of time behaviour of the circuits .",
    "[ control - hopfield ] by the network parameters",
    "@xmath98 , dynamics ( [ eq - q ] ) can be specified within an arbitrarily small error . more precisely , for any @xmath40 ,",
    "any given continuous functions @xmath101 defined on bounded domain @xmath7 , and for any @xmath76 , we can choose parameters @xmath22 such that @xmath102    therefore , any structurally stable dynamics can be generated by system ( [ hopfmodel ] ) .",
    "this result shows that the variables @xmath52 can exhibit complicated dynamics , periodical or chaotical .",
    "in particular , any kind of stable chaos can occur in the dynamics of our systems , for example , the smale horseshoes , anosov flows , the ruelle - takens - newhouse chaos , etc . @xcite .    in general , greater the neuron number @xmath1 , more complex this time dynamics .",
    "thus , the neuron states @xmath103 also can demonstrate a complicated dynamics however , if @xmath104 , all the @xmath1 neuron states are strongly correlated since they can be defined through a relatively small number of the hidden variables .",
    "for a proof of lemma  [ control - hopfield ] see @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we shall show that the gene networks can simulate , in a sense , any reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "notice that some fundamental and simple biological principles are beyond the mathematics .",
    "the genes are organised in blocks .",
    "the local cell differentiation and growth processes are governed by a collective action of these blocks .",
    "we consider , for simplicity , the case of two component reaction - diffusion systems    @xmath105    @xmath106    the phenomenological approach based on ( [ rd-1])-([rd-2 ] ) gives excellent results for some pattern formation problems ( for example such as shell pigmentation @xcite ) , where nonlinearities can have the following typical form @xcite @xmath107    @xmath108    we suppose here that all constants @xmath109 are positive .    in these equations , @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "are unknown functions of the space variables @xmath112 defined in a bounded domain @xmath7 .    system ( [ rd-1])([rd-2 ] ) must be complemented by standard initial and boundary conditions .",
    "suppose the system of equations that governs patterning is two - component system ( [ rd-1])([rd-2 ] ) , where nonlinearities @xmath113 and @xmath114 are continuous functions .",
    "the general multi - component case can be studied in a similar way .",
    "assume solutions of ( [ rd-1])([rd-2 ] ) remain globally bounded , i.e. , for some positive constants @xmath115 we have the estimate @xmath116 for all @xmath117 , if it holds for @xmath118 .",
    "let us define the domain @xmath119 as follows : @xmath120 we suppose that initial condition belongs to @xmath119 for each @xmath17 .",
    "our goal is to show that , for a given reaction - diffusion system ( [ rd-1])([rd-2 ] ) we can always find an `` @xmath27- equivalent '' circuit ( [ genemodel ] ) .",
    "namely , for this equivalent circuit there exists a smooth map @xmath121 transforming the gene concentrations to the reagent concentrations and such that time evolution of @xmath122 is defined by a new reaction -diffusion system with nonlinearities @xmath123 , @xmath27- close to nonlinearities @xmath124 . roughly speaking we can say that any reaction -diffusion system can be realized as a gene circuit .    to this end",
    "modular principle_. let us consider a system ( [ genemodel ] ) having a special block structure .",
    "namely , we assume that there exist two kinds of the genes .",
    "we denote these groups of the genes by @xmath85 and @xmath38 , where vector @xmath125 contains @xmath37 components and @xmath126 contains @xmath127 components . naturally , @xmath128 .",
    "we consider system ( [ genemodel ] ) of the special form    @xmath129    @xmath130    here we use notation ( [ sum ] ) and matrices @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 describe interactions between different groups of the genes .    in general ,",
    "these interactions are not symmetric , i.e. , @xmath134 is not equal to the transpose of @xmath135 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath136 and @xmath137 coincide with the diffusion coefficients in equations ( [ rd-1 ] ) and ( [ rd-2 ] ) .",
    "we choose the entries of the matrices @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 as follows : @xmath138 and @xmath139 where @xmath140 are unknown coefficients .",
    "let us define `` collective variables '' @xmath141    after some calculations ( see the appendix , part 1 ) we obtain @xmath142 and @xmath143 where @xmath144 @xmath145    applying lemma  [ approxlemma ] , we notice that for any @xmath76 there exist numbers @xmath37 , @xmath127 , vectors @xmath146 and @xmath147 such that @xmath148 for all @xmath149 from some bounded domain .",
    "this proves the main result of this section :    consider problem ( [ rd-1])([rd-2 ] ) whose solutions remain in a domain @xmath119 . then , if functions @xmath113 , @xmath114 are continuous , for any @xmath76 , there exist such a system ( [ genemodel ] ) with a sufficiently large number @xmath1 and coefficients @xmath150 and @xmath151 such that the functions @xmath152 satisfy the system @xmath153 @xmath154 where @xmath155 @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , any reaction - diffusion patterning processes on a bounded time interval @xmath158 $ ] can be performed as well by genetic networks . in other words , the pattern capacity of the gene circuits on bounded time intervals",
    "are not less than the pattern capacity of reaction - diffusion systems .    to conclude this section , let us notice that an inverse problem , namely an approximation of a neural network by a reaction - diffusion system has been considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section we state an analytical algorithm resolving the following problem : given spatio - temporal pattern , to find a gene circuit generating this pattern . we show that this problem can be solved even without diffusion ( @xmath159 ) . in our approach",
    "the space signalling is provided by space - depending activation thresholds .",
    "it is important from the biological point of view since the molecular transport is often performed by non - diffusional mechanisms @xcite . for time discrete networks ,",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite .    beside multilayered network theory ( lemma  [ approxlemma ] )",
    "we also use the following result .",
    "[ superposition theorem ] [ superp ] let us consider a family @xmath160 of gene circuits ( [ genemodel ] ) with the parameters @xmath161 , where the functions @xmath20 are fixed and identical for all the circuits .",

    "then , for any @xmath76 and for any continuous positive function @xmath163 , there is a network ( [ genemodel ] ) generating an output pattern @xmath164 such that @xmath165    this result can be interpreted as a _",

    "this result also has interesting biological corollaries ; we discuss it in sect .",
    "[ sec - ccl ] .",
    "let us describe first the outline of the proof .",
    "the proof is based on _",
    "modular principle_. we suppose that an unknown interaction matrix @xmath169 of the network can be decomposed in blocks .",
    "some blocks contain the known matrices @xmath170 corresponding to @xmath171-th network of given network family .",
    "an additional block determines an interaction between new genes and the genes involved in the networks of the family @xmath160 .",
    "this structure allows us to apply the approximation results of the multilayered network theory @xcite ( see lemma  [ approxlemma ] ) .",
    "this assumption about the structure of the matrix @xmath84 also is in agreement with contemporary ideas in molecular biology @xcite .",
    "the proof ( which , by _ modular principle _",
    ", is quite straightforward ) can be found in the appendix .",
    "since the basic element of the proof of superposition principle is lemma  [ approxlemma ] , and the proof of this lemma gives us an algorithm , therefore we obtain a complicated but quite constructive algorithm resolving the patterning problem .",
    "moreover , we can estimate the number of the genes @xmath172 involved in patterning process as a function of the pattern complexity defined by ( [ comp ] ) .",
    "namely , using the results of the work @xcite , we find that @xmath173 depends polynomially on @xmath174 , where @xmath174 is a conditional complexity of @xmath38 respectively given patterns @xmath110 . to explain this relation and its biological meaning , let us consider a simple example .",
    "suppose our problem is to construct a periodic one - dimensional pattern @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is a large number .",
    "our target pattern therefore is sharply oscillating .",
    "moreover , we have no stored ( old ) patterns @xmath177 and thus @xmath178 is proportional to @xmath176 . in this case , to resolve the pattern approximation problem , the network have to involve many genes .",
    "assume now that there are old patterns @xmath177 and , in particular , the patterns of the form @xmath179 , where @xmath180 but @xmath181 .",
    "in this case the function @xmath38 can be expressed through @xmath177 as a polynom of degree @xmath182 .",
    "thus @xmath174 is much less @xmath183 for large @xmath184 and @xmath176 .    roughly speaking , a complex target pattern may be simple respectively to another complex pattern .",

    "this is a problem of nonlinear approximation since functions @xmath214 and @xmath215 depend linearly on @xmath216 and @xmath217 but nonlinearly on @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath20 and @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
    "coefficients @xmath216 and @xmath217 can be calculated by the classical least square method , but other coefficients have to be determined in a proper way .",
    "for instance , we could choose these coefficients randomly and select the best values ( or a satisfying value ) , however this is usually too long when the search space is large . here",
    "this random method can not be used due to the fact that the functions ( [ fmeinh ] ) and ( [ gmeinh ] ) depend on two variables .",
    "if we approximate a function of a single variable , this simple random method can be useful and we apply it below .    to make this nonlinear approximation , we use an iterative approach proposed by jones @xcite ( see also barron @xcite ) .",
    "jones result is an iterative version of approximation lemma  [ approxlemma ] : under the conditions of this lemma one can find a sequence of approximating functions @xmath223 ( denoted @xmath224 for brevity ) satisfying @xmath225 where @xmath226 is a constant depending on @xmath75 .",
    "as already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec - aux ] , barron @xcite has related @xmath226 to the fourier transform of @xmath75 . for more oscillating functions @xmath75 , the constant @xmath226 is greater .",
    "this constant can be considered as a measure of complexity of @xmath75 .",
    "jones sequence is defined as follows : @xmath227 , where @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 give an almost minimal value of @xmath231 .",
    "then , for any @xmath232 , @xmath233 , where @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 give an almost minimal value of @xmath238 .",
    "barron @xcite formulates precise conditions on these almost minimal values in order to obtain equation ( [ approxg ] ) , but we do not use these conditions here . the important point we use",
    "is that optimising only one sigmoidal function each time , jones sequence is able to achieve @xmath239 approximation .",
    "this permits to avoid a global optimisation of all the coefficients involved nonlinearly .",
    "the linearly involved coefficients @xmath234 and @xmath235 can be computed by the least square method and the nonlinearly involved coefficients @xmath236 ( which are two - dimensional like @xmath68 ) and @xmath237 can be determined by a random method .",
    "such approach allows us to approximate functions ( [ fmeinh ] ) and ( [ gmeinh ] ) .",
    "the numerical parameters were @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 . in this case system ( [ rd-1])([gmeinh ] ) with neumann boundary conditions has an homogeneous equilibrium solution @xmath246 , @xmath247 .",

    "moreover , the perturbation spreads to the right like a wave .",
    "see @xcite p. 30 .",
    "this behaviour is presented in fig .",

    "we approximated meinhardt s model by a gene network , with @xmath254 genes ( @xmath255 to approximate function ( [ fmeinh ] ) and @xmath255 for ( [ gmeinh ] ) ) .",
    "the behaviour is qualitatively similar to the solution of meinhardt s model .",
    "[ meinapp ] .",
    "the second point we illustrate is the universal pattern generation problem : given a spatio - temporal pattern , to find a gene network generating pattern .",
    "we first generate spatio - temporal patterns with one spatial dimension .",
    "the corresponding gene network can be defined as follows : @xmath256 @xmath257    @xmath258    @xmath259    notice that diffusion is absent and positional information is provided by the space - dependent threshold @xmath260 . in this one - dimensional case , the condition on @xmath261 means that this function is strictly monotone .    as it is shown in sect .",
    "[ sec - prog ] , @xmath39 and @xmath17 are functions of @xmath262 .",
    "namely , @xmath263 and @xmath264 thus any @xmath265 can be presented as a function of @xmath262 : @xmath266 notice that @xmath267 approximates @xmath268 as @xmath269 . in turn , @xmath270 approximates @xmath271 .",
    "hence , to solve the pattern generation problem , we have to determine the coefficients @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 such that @xmath276 approximates @xmath277 .",
    "it is possible if @xmath278 is a continuous function .",
    "the problem is thus to approximate a function of two variables ( @xmath279 and @xmath280 ) .",
    "this problem is intractable with the least square and the random methods , and we use here again jones iterative approximation method ( see above ) .    to avoid singularities at the lines @xmath281 and @xmath282 ,",
    "we have approximated this function @xmath278 in the image of the bounded rectangle @xmath283\\times[x_0,x_1]$ ] by the map @xmath284 , which is a one - to - one map of @xmath285 .",

    "this function is independent of time , but time - dependent functions have also been approximated ( it is not shown ) .",
    "we have used @xmath290 sigmoidal functions for this simulation .",
    "the last point we illustrate is the superposition principle and its relation with the conditional complexity ( see sect .",
    "[ sec - prog ] ) .",
    "the superposition theorem  [ superp ] states that a given network generating a pattern @xmath307 and a given continuous function @xmath54 , one can device a new network generating @xmath308 .",
    "the number of the genes involved in this new network depends on the complexity of the target pattern .",
    "this complexity can be defined by the fourier transform of the pattern @xcite .",
    "we define the conditional complexity @xmath309 as the complexity of @xmath308 _ considered as a function of @xmath307_. the point is that @xmath309 can be much less than @xmath310 .",
    "so generating @xmath308 through @xmath307 we may use much less genes than generating @xmath308 directly ( or , if the same gene number is involved , a better precision may be achieved ) .",
    "we illustrate this fact by generating @xmath311 for @xmath312 $ ] .",
    "we produce this time function directly and , moreover , we first generate @xmath313 , then @xmath314 , later @xmath315 and finally @xmath316 .",
    "the network generating @xmath311 directly is    @xmath317    @xmath318    @xmath319    where @xmath272 , @xmath320 and @xmath321 are chosen so that @xmath322 approximates @xmath311 .",
    "the network producing @xmath311 indirectly is @xmath323 @xmath324 @xmath325    @xmath326    @xmath327    @xmath328    @xmath329    @xmath330    @xmath331    where @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 have been chosen so that @xmath335 approximates @xmath313 and @xmath336 , @xmath337 and @xmath338 have been chosen so that @xmath339 approximates @xmath340 .",
    "we have used the same number of equations in the two cases , namely @xmath341 , ( so , @xmath342 in equation ( [ dir2 ] ) ) and we have compared the precision achieved . for the indirect approximation , we have chose @xmath343 and hence , @xmath344 .",
    "the target pattern is defined by a function of a single variable . in this case and with a small number of the genes ,",
    "using of jones method is not obligatory . actually , here by the least square method for the linear coefficients and a random choice for the nonlinear ones we achieve a better precision .",
    "[ accel ] presents the results .",
    "the patterns computed by systems ( [ dir1])([dir3 ] ) and ( [ indir1])([indir9 ] ) are denoted respectively `` direct approximation '' and `` indirect approximation '' .",
    "it is shown that the genetic networks with binary interaction of the genes have a formidable patterning capacity .",
    "they can produce any spatio - temporal patterns .",
    "moreover , it is proved that any reaction - diffusion systems can be approximated by genetic circuits .",
    "this result allows to connect earlier phenomenological mathematical reaction - diffusion models and more biologically realistic genetic circuits .",
    "let us emphasise that , by these circuits , pattern programming can be performed .",
    "this means that , for a given pattern , a circuit that builds this pattern , can be found by effective and universal algorithms .",
    "one of the most astonishing biological revelations of the past twenty years is that much of the basic machinery of development is essentially the same , not in all vertebrates but in all the major phyla of invertebrates too @xcite .",
    "we show therefore that this machinery can be described by simple gene circuit models .",
    "this pattern programming holds on a basic biological principle : on modular organisation of genes .",
    "genes are organised in blocs .",
    "notice that the modular principle is confirmed by experimental data of molecular biology ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that this modular structure entails an interesting property , which can be named `` superposition principle '' .",
    "this superposition property means that new patterns can always be obtained by previous ( old ) patterns .    as an elementary example explaining a biological interpretation of superposition principle we can consider flappers , wings and legs of tetrapodes .",
    "it is well known that they consist of the same basic elements ( numerus , cubitus , radius , carpe ) but jointed in different ways ( see @xcite ) .",
    "different joinings give wings for birds , legs for dogs , flappers for whales etc . when mammals penetrated in water , evolution did not invented flappers from zero .",
    "evolution used earlier created patterns to obtain flappers .",
    "thus , the superposition principle allows us to understand why the gene number grows relatively slow in evolution ( remind that _",
    "drosophila _ has the @xmath345 genes , _ c. elegans _ has the @xmath346 and _ homo sapiens _ has the @xmath347 genes ) . indeed , as we have explained in sect .",
    "[ sec - prog ] and  [ sec - num ] , the gene number growth is not directly proportional to the pattern complexity ; this number is proportional to conditional pattern complexity relatively already stored patterns .",
    "this conditional quantity may be small even if the target pattern is very complex .",
    "we can thus conclude that the modular organisation of gene interaction leads to a minimisation of time and genes in a process of invention of new biological structures .",
    "a famous basic evolutionary law asserts that the ontogenesis summarises the philogenesis @xcite .",
    "the mathematical results of this paper suggest that this law is a direct consequence of gene network organisation .",
    "first we choose a large @xmath353 to satisfy ( [ c2 ] ) and then we can take a constant @xmath354 large enough to satisfy ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "now we can prove that the domain @xmath119 is an invariant rectangle for ( [ rd-1])-([rd-2 ] ) .",
    "this means that on the boundaries @xmath355 and @xmath356 the vector field @xmath357 is directed inside @xmath119 .",
    "we consider a large network involving a number of genes .",
    "first , it involves the genes @xmath358 , where @xmath359 , participating in given networks .",
    "the corresponding dynamics is defined by the equations @xmath360 where @xmath359 .            given a function @xmath366 $ ] , positive numbers @xmath27 and @xmath367 , there are a function @xmath368 $ ] and a positive coefficient @xmath369 such that the solution of the cauchy problem @xmath370 \\label{space - threshold4}\\ ] ] satisfies the following inequality              notice that the lemma also holds for @xmath376 $ ] , since any continuous function can be approximated by a smooth function .",
    "moreover , if given @xmath38 is a superposition of the form @xmath377 , where @xmath378 are defined by some system of autonomous differential equations , then @xmath379 can also be represented as a superposition : @xmath380 .",
    "to finish the proof of theorem  [ superp ] , it is sufficient to prove that for any continuous function of the form @xmath381 , where @xmath382 $ ] and @xmath76 , there exists such a choice of the parameters @xmath383 and @xmath384 in ( [ space - threshold2 ] ) and ( [ space - threshold3 ] ) that the solutions @xmath362 of ( [ space - threshold2 ] ) satisfy the estimate @xmath385    for any @xmath386 $ ] . using the monotonicity of @xmath12 and choosing a sufficiently large @xmath384 , we simplify the last estimate and obtain @xmath387 , \\label{space - threshold16}\\ ] ] where @xmath388 is given",
