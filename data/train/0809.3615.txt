    "the problem is far more subtle , because the behaviour of the zerilli potential @xmath21 @xcite at @xmath22 ( which corresponds to the @xmath20 schwarzschild singularity ) implies a one parameter ambiguity @xcite in boundary conditions at this point ( parameterized by @xmath23 , see equation ( [ sae ] ) below ) , and also because @xmath21 has a second order pole at @xmath24 which falls within the domain of interest for negative @xmath15 .",

    "this implies that @xmath3 is singular at @xmath7 , as is also evident from equation ( [ zeri ] ) .",
    "the kind of singularity in @xmath3 is characterized in the following lemma : + * lemma 1 : * if @xmath10 , a metric perturbation is smooth if and only if its zerilli function at any fixed time is @xmath107 in open sets not containing @xmath7 , and admits a laurent expansion @xmath108 if initial data @xmath91 and @xmath92 is given , both functions satisfying ( [ crc ] ) , the evolution equation will preserve ( [ crc ] ) , i.e. , this condition will hold at all times .",

    "furthermore , since ( [ zerilli ] ) is a wave equation in the half space @xmath31 , we need to specify boundary conditions at @xmath22 , besides the initial values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , to have a unique solution .",

    "the `` kinematic '' singularity at @xmath127 in ( [ zeri ] ) indicates that physically acceptable zerilli functions have a simple pole at @xmath7 ( lemma 1 ) .",

    "we find , @xmath322 where @xmath282 is a constant .",
    "this implies that @xmath289 and @xmath323 are both non vanishing and have the same sign and , therefore , @xmath289 is increasing if @xmath324 , decreasing if @xmath325 .",
    "then , in order to have a zero for @xmath80 , there must be a point where @xmath326 .",
    "but from [ zm5a ] we notice that for @xmath80 , at any point where @xmath326 we must have @xmath289 , and @xmath327 with the same sign , namely , this corresponds to a minimum for positive @xmath289 and a maximum for negative @xmath289 .",
    "but since , e.g. , for @xmath328 , the function is already increasing , and the condition @xmath326 can not be satisfied for @xmath329 , implying that @xmath319 has no zeros for @xmath317 , and similarly for @xmath325 . thus @xmath330 is regular for @xmath331 , it vanishes as @xmath321 for @xmath332 ( see ( [ zm5a ] ) ) , and as @xmath333 for large @xmath12 . in this respect , it is similar to the zerilli potential @xmath334 .",
    "one can see , however , that @xmath330 is not positive definite , ( see figure 2 , left panel for an example ) , making the proof of the stability of the exterior region of a schwarzschild black hole more complicated in the context of the @xmath14 formulation .",
    "the proof for @xmath10 holds also for positive mass .      parts ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the theorem were proved in the two previous subsections .",
    "part ( iv ) follows from lemma 4 and a uniqueness argument : since there is a unique solution in @xmath19 of the equation @xmath335 with initial condition @xmath336 , and @xmath337 is such a solution if @xmath3 solves zerilli s equation with initial data @xmath338 and boundary condition @xmath339 for @xmath340 , it must be @xmath341 , then part ( iv ) follows from lemma 4 and the fact that @xmath249 for the intertwiner @xmath149 that we use .",
    "the propagation of gravitational perturbations on a negative mass schwarzschild background is a subtle problem for two reasons .",
    "first , this space is not globally hyperbolic . as a consequence",
    ", the perturbation equations can be reduced to a single @xmath16 wave equation with a space dependent potential for the so called zerilli function , restricted to a semi - infinite domain @xmath31 , @xmath342 being standard inertial coordinates on two dimensional minkowski space , @xmath22 the position of the singularity .",
    "this implies that a physically motivated choice of boundary conditions at @xmath22 is required .",
    "there is a unique choice dictated simultaneously by two conditions @xcite : ( i ) that the linearized regime be valid in the whole domain , and , in particular , that the invariants made out of the riemman tensor behave such that their first order piece does not diverge faster than their zeroth order piece as the singularity is approached ; ( ii ) that the energy of the perturbation , as measured using the second order correction to the einstein tensor @xcite be finite .",
    "+ the second problematic issue with the standard approach is not essential , but related to a choice of variables : the zerilli function @xmath3 is a singular function of the first order metric coefficients . as a consequence ,",
    "the wave equation it obeys has a potential with a `` kinematic '' singularity , and it is not clear how to evolve initial data , since the usual approach of separation of variables leading to a well behaved quantum hamiltonian operator for the @xmath2 coordinate breaks down .",
    "+ we have introduced an alternative diagonalization of the linearized even mode einstein s equation around a schwarzschild spacetime , using a field @xmath14 which is smooth for regular metric perturbations , regardless the sign of the mass @xmath15 .",
    "this field obeys a wave equation with a smooth potential , that can be solved by separation of variables .",
    "moreover , the spatial piece of the modified wave equation has a unique self adjoint extension , that naturally selects the boundary condition that is physically relevant .",
    "+ the connection between the two fields is provided by an intertwining operator , @xmath343 , similar to the operators linking supersymmetric pairs of quantum hamiltonians .",
    "we have also shown that , in spite of the fact that @xmath344 has a non trivial kernel , it is possible to evolve the perturbation equations using , at two different steps , the initial condition for the zerilli function .",
    "a straightforward application of this formalism allows us to show that the unstable mode found in @xcite can actually be excited by initial data compactly supported away from the singularity .",
    "this closes a gap in our proof in @xcite of the linear instability of the negative mass schwarzschild spacetime .",
