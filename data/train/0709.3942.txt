    "changes of hadron properties are indications of chiral symmetry restoration occurring in hot and/or dense qcd and have been explored using various effective chiral approaches  @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of dielectron mass spectra below the @xmath3 resonance was first observed at cern sps  @xcite and it is an indication of the medium modification of the vector mesons .",
    "the vector meson mass in matter still remains an open issue .",
    "although there are several scenarios like collisional broadening due to interactions with the surrounding hot / dense medium  @xcite , and dropping @xmath0 meson mass associated with chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite , no conclusive distinction between them has been done .",
    "indeed , the in - medium modification carried by @xmath0 near the critical point may not be apparent in the final yield depending on the fireball evolution under the cern sps condition  @xcite .",
    "however , dropping masses of hadrons following the brown - rho ( br ) scaling  @xcite can be one of the most prominent candidates of the strong signal of melting quark condensate @xmath4 which is an order parameter of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , if the signal is not washed out through the evolution , especially at rhic .    the vector manifestation ( vm )  @xcite is a novel pattern of the wigner realization of chiral symmetry in which the @xmath0 meson becomes massless degenerate with the pion at the chiral phase transition point .",
    "the vm is formulated  @xcite in the effective field theory based on the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite .",
    "the vm gives a field theoretical description of the dropping @xmath0 mass , which is protected by the existence of the fixed point ( vm fixed point ) .",
    "the dropping mass is supported by the mass shift of the @xmath5 meson in nuclei measured by the kek - ps e325 experiment  @xcite and the cbelsa / taps collaboration  @xcite and also that of the @xmath0 meson observed in the star experiment  @xcite .",
    "recently na60 collaboration has provided data for the dimuon spectrum  @xcite and it seems difficult to explain the data by a naive dropping @xmath0  @xcite . however , there are still several ambiguities which are not considered  @xcite . especially , the strong violation of the vector dominance ( vd ) , which is one of the significant predictions of the vm  @xcite , plays an important role  @xcite to explain the data .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the dilepton production rate from the dropping @xmath0 based on the vm using the hls theory at finite temperature .",
    "we paid a special attention to the effect of the violation of the vector dominance ( indicated by `` @xmath6 '' ) which is due to the _ intrinsic temperature effects _ of the parameters introduced through the matching to qcd in the wilsonian sense combined with the renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "we made a comparison of the dilepton production rates predicted by the vm with the ones by the dropping @xmath0 with the assumption of the vector dominance ( vd ) .",
    "the result shows that the effect of the @xmath6 substantially suppresses the dilepton production rate compared with the one predicted by assuming the vd together with the dropping @xmath0 .",
    "this write - up is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : vm ] we explain what the vm is .",
    "section  [ sec : ds ] is a main part in which we show the form factor and dilepton production rate .",
    "a brief summary and discussions are given in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the vector manifestation ( vm ) was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite as a novel manifestation of wigner realization of chiral symmetry where the vector meson @xmath0 becomes massless at the chiral phase transition point .",
    "accordingly , the ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 becomes the chiral partner of the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson @xmath7 .",
    "the vm is characterized by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the decay constant of ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 at @xmath0 on - shell .",
    "this is completely different from the conventional picture based on the linear sigma model where the scalar meson @xmath10 becomes massless degenerate with @xmath7 as the chiral partner : @xmath11 in ref .",
    "@xcite this was called gl manifestation after the effective theory of ginzburg  landau or gell - mann  levy .",
    "we first consider the representations of the following zero helicity ( @xmath12 ) states under @xmath13 ; the @xmath7 , the ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 , the ( longitudinal ) axial - vector meson denoted by @xmath14 ( @xmath15 meson and its flavor partners ) and the scalar meson denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath7 and the longitudinal @xmath14 are admixture of @xmath16 and @xmath17 since the symmetry is spontaneously broken  @xcite : @xmath18 where the experimental value of the mixing angle @xmath19 is given by approximately @xmath20  @xcite . on the other hand , the longitudinal @xmath0 belongs to pure @xmath21 and the scalar meson to pure @xmath22 : @xmath23    when the chiral symmetry is restored at the phase transition point , it is natural to expect that the chiral representations coincide with the mass eigenstates : the representation mixing is dissolved . from eq .",
    "( [ mix pi a ] ) one can easily see that there are two ways to express the representations in the wigner phase of chiral symmetry : the conventional gl manifestation corresponds to the limit @xmath24 in which @xmath7 is in the representation of pure @xmath17 together with the scalar meson , both being the chiral partners : @xmath25 on the other hand , the vm corresponds to the limit @xmath26 in which the @xmath14 goes to a pure @xmath22 , now degenerate with the scalar meson @xmath10 in the same representation , but not with @xmath0 in @xmath21 : @xmath27 namely , the degenerate massless @xmath7 and ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 at the phase transition point are the chiral partners in the representation of @xmath21 .",
    "next , we consider the helicity @xmath28 .",
    "note that the transverse @xmath0 can belong to the representation different from the one for the longitudinal @xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) and thus can have the different chiral partners . according to the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transverse components of @xmath0 ( @xmath28 ) in the broken phase belong to almost pure @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) with tiny mixing with @xmath33 .",
    "then , it is natural to consider in vm that they become pure @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the limit approaching the chiral restoration point  @xcite : @xmath36 as a result , the chiral partners of the transverse components of @xmath0 in the vm will be themselves .",
    "the formulation of the vm was first done in the large flavor qcd  @xcite , and then in the hot and dense qcd  @xcite .",
    "the formulation was done within the framework of the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite , in which it is possible to perform a systematic derivative expansion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    at the leading order of the chiral perturbation with hls",
    "the lagrangian includes three parameters : the pion decay constant @xmath37 ; the hls gauge coupling @xmath38 ; and a parameter @xmath39 . using these three parameters , the @xmath0 meson mass @xmath40 , the @xmath0-@xmath41 mixing strength @xmath42 , the @xmath0-@xmath7-@xmath7 coupling strength @xmath43 and the direct @xmath41-@xmath7-@xmath7 coupling strength @xmath44",
    "are expressed as @xmath45 from these expression , one can easily see that the vector dominance ( vd ) of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion , i.e. @xmath46 , is satisfied for @xmath47 .",
    "we would like to stress that the vd at zero temperature and density is accidentaly satisfied : the parameter @xmath39 is @xmath48 at the bare level and it becomes @xmath49 in the low - energy region by including the quantum correction  @xcite .",
    "this can be rephrased in the following way : the parameter @xmath39 at the large @xmath50 limit is @xmath48 and it becomes @xmath49 when the @xmath51 corrections are included  @xcite .",
    "the most important ingredient to formulate the vm in hot matter is the intrinsic temperature dependence of the parameters of the hls lagrangian  @xcite introduced through the wilsonian matching between the hls and qcd : the wilsonian matching near the critical temperature @xmath52 provides the following behavior for the bare parameters @xmath39 and @xmath38 : @xmath53 it was shown  @xcite that these conditions are protected by the fixed point of the rges and never receives quantum corrections at the critical point .",
    "thus the parametric vector meson mass determined at the on - shell of the vector meson also vanishes since it is proportional to the vanishing gauge coupling constant .",
    "the vector meson mass @xmath40 defined as a pole position of the full vector meson propagator has the hadronic corrections through thermal loops , which are proportional to the gauge coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "consequently the vector meson pole mass also goes to zero for @xmath54 : @xmath55 we would like to stress that the vd is strongly violated near the critical point associated with the dropping @xmath0 in the vm in hot matter  @xcite : @xmath56",
    "we should note that the conditions in eq .",
    "( [ bare g a ] ) hold _ only in the vicinity of @xmath52 _ : they are not valid any more far away from @xmath52 where ordinary hadronic temperature corrections are dominant . for expressing a temperature",
    "above which the intrinsic effect becomes important , we introduce a temperature @xmath57 , so - called flash temperature  @xcite .",
    "the vm and therefore the dropping @xmath0 mass become transparent for @xmath58 . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that the intrinsic effects are negligible in the low - temperature region below @xmath57 : only hadronic temperature corrections are considered for @xmath59 . based on the above consideration , we adopt the following ansatz of the temperature dependences of the bare @xmath38 and @xmath39 :  . ]",
    "@xmath60 here we would like to remark that the brown - rho scaling deals with the quantity directly locked to the quark condensate and hence _",
    "the scaling masses are achieved exclusively by the intrinsic effect _ in the present framework .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calcuated the mass and the width of @xmath0 meson as well as the direct-@xmath61 coupling strength in hot matter using the in - medium parameters determined in the above way .",
    "we show the resultant temperature dependences in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass width gpp ] .     + ( a ) ( b ) ( c )    figures  [ fig : mass width gpp](a ) and ( b )",
    "show that , below the flash temperature @xmath57 , both the mass and width slighly increase with temperature caused by the hadronic temperature effects . for @xmath62 , on the other hand , the intrinsic effects become dominant and both the mass and width decrease rapidly toward zero .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass width gpp](c ) shows that , in the temperature region below @xmath57 , @xmath63 is almost zero realizing the vector dominance ( vd ) . above @xmath57",
    "the parameter @xmath39 starts to decrease from 2 to 1 due to the intrinsic effect .",
    "this causes an increase of @xmath63 toward @xmath64 , which implies the strong violation of the vd .",
    "figure  [ fig : form ] shows the pion electromagnetic form factor for several temperatures .     + ( a ) ( b )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : form ] ( a ) only the hadronic temperature corrections are included in the form factor .",
    "there is no remarkable shift of the @xmath0 meson mass but the width becomes broader with increasing temperature , which is consistent with the previous study  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : form ] ( b ) the intrinsic temperature effects are also included into all the parameters in the form factor .",
    "at the temperature below @xmath57 , the hadronic effect dominates the form factor , so that the curves for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 agree with the corresponding ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : form](a ) . at @xmath68",
    "the intrinsic effect starts to contribute and thus in the temperature region above @xmath57 the peak position of the form factor moves as @xmath69 with increasing temperature toward @xmath52 .",
    "associated with this dropping @xmath0 mass , the width becomes narrow , and the value of the form factor at the peak grows up as  @xcite @xmath70    now , let us show the thermal dipepton production rate predicted in the vm .",
    "a lepton pair is emitted from the hot matter through a decaying virtual photon .",
    "the differential production rate in the medium for a fixed temperature @xmath71 is expressed in terms of the imaginary part of the photon self - energy @xmath72 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath75 is the invariant mass of the produced dilepton and @xmath76 denotes the momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "we will focus on an energy region around the @xmath0 meson mass scale in this analysis . in this energy region",
    "it is natural to expect that the photon self - energy is dominated by the two - pion process and its imaginary part is related to the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath77 through @xmath78 with the pion mass @xmath79 .",
    "as noted , the vector dominance ( vd ) is controlled by the parameter @xmath39 in the hls theory .",
    "the vm leads to the strong violation of the vd ( indicated by `` @xmath6 '' ) near the chiral symmetry restoration point , which can be traced through the wilsonian matching and the rg evolutions .",
    "thus the direct photon-@xmath7-@xmath7 @xmath44 coupling yields non - vanishing contribution to the form factor together with the @xmath0-meson exchange . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compared the dilepton spectra predicted in the vm ( including the effect of @xmath6 ) with those obtained by assuming the vd , i.e. taking @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dl ] shows the form factor and the dilepton production rate integrated over three - momentum , in which the results with vd and @xmath6 were compared .",
    "+   +   +   +    the figure shows a clear difference between the curves with vd and @xmath6 . in the low - temperature region @xmath80 ,",
    "the hadronic effects are dominant compared with the intrinsic ones , so both curves almost coincide .",
    "a difference between them starts to appear around @xmath81 and increases with temperature .",
    "it can be easily seen that the @xmath6 gives a reduction compared to the case with keeping the vd .",
    "the features of the form factor as well as the dilepton production rate coming from two - pion annihilation shown in fig .  [ fig : dl](a)-(e ) are summarized below for each temperature :    ( a ) and ( b ) ( below @xmath57 ) : : :    the form factor , which has a peak at the @xmath0 meson mass    @xmath82 mev , is slightly suppressed with    increasing temperature . an extent of the suppression in case with    @xmath6    is greater than that with vd .",
    "this is due to decreasing of the    @xmath0-@xmath41 mixing strength    @xmath42 at finite temperature . at @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath42 mainly decreases by hadronic corrections . in case    with vd , however , @xmath42 is almost constant .",
    "the    dilepton rate ( a ) has two peaks , one is at the @xmath0    meson mass and another one is lying around low - mass region .",
    "the later    peak comes from the boltzman factor of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) . for a rather    low - temperature the production rate",
    "is much enhanced compared with the    @xmath0 meson peak since the yield in the higher - mass    region is suppressed by the statistical factor . with increasing    temperature those peaks of the production rate ( b ) are enhanced and    the peak at @xmath83 clearly appears . in    association with decreasing @xmath42 , one sees a reduction    of the dilepton rate with    @xmath6 .",
    "( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) ( above @xmath57 ) : : :    since the intrinsic temperature effects are turned on , a shift of the    @xmath0 meson mass to lower - mass region can be seen .    furthermore , the form factor , which becomes narrower with increasing    temperature due to the dropping @xmath40 , exhibits an    obvious discrepancy between the cases with vd and    @xmath6 .",
    "the production rate based on the vm ( i.e. , the case with    @xmath6 )    is suppressed compared to that with the vd .",
    "we observe that the    suppression is more transparent for larger temperature : the    suppression factor is @xmath84 in ( c ) ,    @xmath85 in ( d ) and @xmath86 in ( e ) .",
    "+    as one can see in ( c ) , the peak value of the rate predicted by the vm    in the temperature region slightly above the flash temperature is even    smaller than the one obtained by the vacuum parameters , and the shapes    of them are quite similar to each other .",
    "this indicates that it might    be difficult to measure the signal of the dropping @xmath0    experimentally , if this temperature region is dominant in the    evolution of the fireball . in the case shown in ( d ) , on the other    hand , the rate by the vm is enhanced by a factor of about two compared    with the one by the vacuum @xmath0 .",
    "the enhancement becomes    prominent near the critical temperature as seen in ( e ) .",
    "these imply    that we may have a chance to discriminate the dropping    @xmath0 from the vacuum @xmath0 .",
    "we studied the pion electromagnetic form factor and the thermal dilepton production rate from the two - pion annihilation within the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) theory as an effective field theory of low - energy qcd . in the hls theory",
    "the chiral symmetry is restored as the vector manifestation ( vm ) in which the massless @xmath0 meson joins the same chiral multiplet as pions . in order to determine the temperature dependences of the parameters of the hls lagrangian , the wilsonian matching to the operator product expansion at finite temperature",
    "was made by applying the matching scheme developed in the vacuum  @xcite and at the critical temperature  @xcite .    in the notion of the wilsonian matching to define a bare theory in hot environment , the bare parameters are dependent on temperature , which are referred as the intrinsic temperature effects . at low temperatures",
    "the chiral properties of in - medium hadrons are dominated by ordinary hadronic loop corrections .",
    "the dropping @xmath0 is realized in the hls framework due to the intrinsic effects and thus they play crucial roles especially near the chiral phase transition . in order to see an influence of the intrinsic temperature effects",
    ", we presented the form factor including full temperature effects , i.e. , the intrinsic and hadronic effects , and compared with that including only hadronic corrections .",
    "the @xmath0 meson mass @xmath40 is almost stable against the hadronic corrections and one does not obtain the dropping @xmath40 .",
    "accordingly the peak of the form factor including only the hadronic effects is located at around @xmath87 mev even at finite temperature .",
    "the form factor is reduced with increasing temperature and correspondingly becomes broader . on the other hand ,",
    "the wilsonian matching procedure certainly involves the intrinsic temperature effects in the analysis and provides the dropping @xmath40 as the vm . the form factor _ above the flash temperature @xmath57",
    "_ thus starts to present a shift of @xmath40 to lower invariant mass region .",
    "associated with the dropping @xmath0 , the form factor becomes sharp .",
    "one of the significant predictions of the vm is a strong violation of the vector dominance ( vd ) of the pion form factor .",
    "the vm predicts that the vd is violated near the transition temperature @xmath52 in which the direct photon-@xmath7-@xmath7 coupling does contribute to the form factor in addition to the @xmath0-meson mediation .",
    "it crucially affects the analysis of dilepton yields .",
    "we presented the form factor and the dilepton production rate with and without the vd assumption together with the dropping @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath80 the result shows only a small difference between those two cases since the vd is still well satisfied in low temperatures .",
    "a clear difference can be seen for @xmath62 where the intrinsic temperature effects contribute to the physical quantities .",
    "the form factor and consequently the dilepton production rate with taking account of the violated vd are reduced and exhibit an obvious difference near @xmath52 compared to those with the vd .",
    "the hls lagrangian has only pions and vector mesons as physical degrees of freedom , and a time evolution was not considered in this work .",
    "thus it is not possible to make a direct comparison of our results with experimental data .",
    "however a _ naive _ dropping @xmath40 formula , i.e. , @xmath88 , as well as vd in hot / dense matter are sometimes used for theoretical implications of the data . as we have shown in this paper ,",
    "the intrinsic temperature effects together with the violation of the vd give a clear difference from the results without including those effects .",
    "it may be then expected that a field theoretical analysis of the dropping @xmath0 as presented in this work and a reliable comparison with dilepton measurements will provide an evidence for the in - medium hadronic properties associated with the chiral symmetry restoration , if complicated hadronization processes do not wash out those changes .",
    "recently the chiral perturbation theory with including vector and axial - vector mesons as well as pions has been constructed  @xcite based on the generalized hls  @xcite . in this theory the dropping @xmath0 and @xmath14 meson masses were formulated and it was shown that the dropping masses are related to the fixed points of the rges which gives a vm - type restoration and that the vd is strongly violated also in this case .",
    "inclusion of the effect of @xmath14 meson as well as the effect of collisional broadening will be done in future work  @xcite .",
