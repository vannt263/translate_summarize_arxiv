    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) is located near the gamsberg mountain in namibia at an altitude of 1800 meters .",
    "detects @xmath1-ray photons by recording the cherenkov light produced by the electromagnetic shower resulting from the interaction of the photons with the atmosphere .",
    "the phase i of the project was completed in december 2003 . at this time",
    "the array was made of four 12-meters telescopes .",
    "each telescope has a camera composed of 960 photo - multipliers ( pmts ) and works in stereoscopic mode .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "phase i array has a field of view of 5 degrees , an angular resolution of 0.1 degree for an energy threshold down to 100  gev .",
    "the array is taking data for more than 10 years now and has increased the catalogue of sources detected in the very high energy range ( vhe , @xmath2100  gev ) and our knowledge of the field .",
    "has discovered more than 80 objects ( galactic or extragalactic , fig .",
    "[ source ] ) , performed a deep galactic plane survey , dark matter searches , multiwavelength campaigns with other instruments and studies of the extragalactic background light with blazars .",
    "one of the aims of h.e.s.s . is the detection of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . while no grb has been detected so far in the vhe range ,",
    "more than 20 follow - up have been performed @xcite .",
    "also monitors variable and bright objects and responds to target of opportunity in order to better know the mechanisms that produce the variability of blazars .",
    "the experiment entered into its phase ii with the addition of a fifth telescope ( named ct5 ) placed in the middle of the array .",
    "the dish is 32.6 meters by 24.3 meters , equivalent to 28-meters circular dish for a focal length of 36 meters .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a alt - az mount @xcite .",
    "the camera composed of 2048 pmts for a total weight of @xmath3 3 tons , can record 3600 images per second @xcite and is mounted on an auto - focus system .",
    "a picture of this telescope is show on figure [ ct5 ] .",
    "the field of view of this telescope is 3.5 degrees for an angular resolution from @xmath3 0.4 degree to less than 0.1 .",
    "the energy coverage of the h.e.s.s .",
    "experiment is then extended down to energies of a few tens of gev .",
    "characteristics of the ct5 telescope are summarized in table [ tablect5 ] .",
    "phase ii is the first hybrid array of cherenkov telescopes and is designed to work in different configurations .",
    "data can be taken by ct5 only in the so - called _",
    "mono mode_. the _ hybrid mode _ involves all five telescopes for a better sensitivity in the entire energy range .",
    "stereoscopic observations with only the four 12-meters telescopes are still possible .",
    "the ability to split the array in 2 ( ct5 mono mode + the four 12 meters telescopes ) allows to increase the observation time which is rather low for such an experiment ( @xmath3 1000 hours per year ) .",
    ".characteristics of the ct5 telescope . [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ table2155 ]         pks 2155 - 304 is naturally a good target for calibration purposes and has been observed for a total live time of 42.9 hours in 2013 .",
    "the analysis yields an excess of more the 4400 events for a detection at a 29.7 @xmath4 level ( table [ table2155 ] ) .",
    "excess map of the field of view and sed are shown on figure [ pksmap ] .",
    "the 2fgl and 1fhl are also used for comparison .    a large part of the data were taken during a multiwavelength campaign with nustar and _ fermi_. these data were used to build the most precise sed of this object to date : nustar extended the x - ray spectrum up to 79 kev and _ fermi _ pass 8 data were used .",
    "more details and results are given in @xcite and in a forthcoming publication .",
    "one of the main goals of the h.e.s.s .",
    "phase ii is to study the variability on short time - scales .",
    "figure [ sens ] presents the differential sensitivity of ct5 and _ fermi _ as a function of time . below @xmath5 seconds",
    ", ct5 is clearly much more sensitive that the lat above 25 gev .",
    "this opens a new window for the detection of grbs in this energy range .",
    "an alert system has been developed to reply to gcn alerts and an automatic re - pointing procedure is in place in case of such an alert .",
    "ct5 can , in such case , be on target within a minute @xcite allowing prompt observations .",
    "the h.e.s.s . array is taking data now since more than 10 years and has allowed many discoveries . with the advent of the phase ii of the experiment",
    ", a new window has been opened in the 30 gev-100 gev energy range . after a commissioning phase , ct5 is now running running in a normal operation mode .",
