    "a lot of attention has been recently devoted to the braneworld scenario , which provides an alternative to the standard kaluza - klein compactification .",
    "in fact , this idea was initiated a long time ago by the suggestion @xcite that particles could be localized on a defect embedded in a higher - dimensional space , the simplest example being the case of a domain wall , or three - brane , in a five - dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "it was then shown , ignoring gravity , that one could localize scalars and fermions on the domain wall .",
    "recent progress was achieved on the gravitational aspect of the problem , by showing that it was possible to localize massless gravitons @xcite , and thus to recover standard four - dimensional gravity , on a brane with tension embedded in an ads bulk , with the appropriate ( negative ) cosmological constant @xmath0 , so that the brane is effectively minkowski .",
    "in addition to the massless gravitons , one finds a continuous spectrum of massive gravitons , starting from zero mass but with a weak coupling to the brane so that their contribution becomes important only on scales of the order of @xmath1 or below .",
    "the analysis of the graviton modes has also been extended to the case of a brane whose effective geometry is de sitter @xcite , which is the case when the brane tension more than compensates the cosmological constant .",
    "the mode analysis on this background yields a massless graviton , analogous to the four - dimensional graviton , plus a continuum of massive modes , which starts at @xmath2 .",
    "there is thus a gap between the zero mode and the massive modes .",
    "a recent work @xcite has generalized this treatment to the case of conformally flat cosmological geometries and shown that the minimum gap is @xmath3 .",
    "not surprisingly , massless bulk scalar fields have properties very similar to the gravitons . in the randall - sundrum ( rs )",
    "background , it is easy to show that , as for gravitons , there exist a localized zero mode and a continuum of arbitrary light states .",
    "when one allows for a small but non - vanishing mass , it turns out that the massless bound state disappears and turns into a quasi - localized state with finite mass and finite width , the latter quantifying the probability for the state to decay into the bulk @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study how these properties of massive bulk scalar fields are modified when the brane geometry is de sitter instead of minkowski .",
    "massive scalar fields are of special interest for a bulk inflaton model of braneworld inflation @xcite , where inflation in the brane is driven by a bulk scalar field , in contrast with a brane inflaton model , where inflation is driven by a four - dimensional field confined to the brane @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we study in detail the _ bound states _ of a massive bulk scalar field , localized on a _ de sitter brane _ , taking also into account the possibility of a _ coupling _ between the scalar field and the tension of the brane .",
    "we show that , depending on the range of values for the scalar field mass @xmath4 and the coupling , one can find bound states , which can be massless or massive .",
    "we then consider and extend another approach , which consists in determining an effective four - dimensional potential for the projection of the bulk scalar field in the brane , taking into account the five dimensional effects , via the effective four - dimensional einstein equations .",
    "we are thus able to deduce an effective four - dimensional potential that combines the five - dimensional potential and the coupling to the brane .",
    "we then compare this approach with the mode approach and find surprisingly good agreement .",
    "namely , given the five - dimensional mass , both the critical coupling allowing for a zero mode and that at which the bound - state ceases to exist agree well with those obtained from the mode analysis .",
    "finally , we also explore some aspects of the quasi - bound states ( or quasi - normal modes ) in the range of parameters where the bound states no longer exist .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section ,",
    "we present the model and give the equation of motion for the bulk scalar field . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the existence of bound states .",
    "section 4 is devoted to an alternative approach based on an effective four - dimensional potential .",
    "finally , we explore , analytically and numerically , the quasi - localized scalar modes , which correspond to modes escaping from the brane into the bulk .",
    "we consider a five - dimensional bulk scalar field @xmath5 and a brane with a tension @xmath6 coupled to this bulk scalar field .",

    "we will take as our background configuration , the solution of the above setup , with the usual cosmological symmetries ( homogeneity and isotropy along the three ordinary spatial dimensions ) , when the scalar field vanishes everywhere . in this case , the bulk is effectively empty of matter and , owing to the cosmological symmetries we impose , its geometry corresponds to ads@xmath9 .",

    "introducing the variable z=(r/ ) , [ z ] the hubble parameter given in ( [ h_r ] ) can be reexpressed as h(z_0)=1 [ h_z ] and the expression of @xmath17 in terms of @xmath18 is therefore _ 0=z_0 .",
    "let us now turn to the scalar field , which will be considered as a test field on the background configuration previously defined .",
    "in other words , we will ignore its backreaction on the geometry . in the bulk",
    ", the scalar field must satisfy the klein - gordon equation , which is given , for the metric ( [ metric ] ) by e^-3ht_t(e^3ht_t ) -1_r(^4(r/ ) _ r)+m^2=0 .",

    "the purpose of this section is to solve explicitly the system of equations ( [ bulkeq][boundary ] ) .",
    "since the bulk equation is separable , it is natural to look for solutions of the form = u(r)(t ) , which leads to a separation of the bulk differential equation ( [ bulkeq ] ) into a radial equation and a time - dependent equation , @xmath19u(r)=0\\ , , \\label{ueq } \\\\ & & \\left[{d^2\\over dt^2}+3h{d\\over dt}+h^2\\lambda^2\\right]\\psi(t)=0\\ , , \\label{psieq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a separation constant . and the boundary condition ( [ boundary ] ) becomes @xmath21    the solution of the radial equation ( [ ueq ] )",

    "the effective four - dimensional mass of the mode , which appears clearly in the time - dependent equation ( [ psieq ] ) , is thus given by m_(4)^2=^2h^2 = ( 9/4-^2)h^2 .    in the rest of this section , we wish to investigate whether there exist bound state solutions .",

    "the bound states are delimited by two extreme cases : the massless mode ( zero mode ) , characterized by the value @xmath28 , and the mode at the top of the gap , characterized by the mass - squared @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 , above which bound states can not exist . for each set of values for @xmath31 ( or @xmath22 ) and @xmath4",
    ", one can thus define two critical values for the coupling , the lower one , @xmath32 , corresponding to a bound state that is also a zero mode and the upper one , @xmath33 giving the threshold above which bound states disappear .",

    "another approach consists in trying to find a purely four - dimensional description of the scalar field including the effect of the bulk . we have generalized previous such procedures to take into account the coupling , and defined an effective potential for the value on the brane of the scalar field . for small @xmath4 and @xmath8 , the second derivative of the effective potential yields an effective mass - squared which is in excellent agreement with the rigorous mode approach for small @xmath31 and in qualitative agreement for large @xmath31 .",
    "we have also demonstrated that a class of known exact solutions with a bulk scalar field indeed conforms to the effective potential approach .    finally , when the three parameters @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath31 are not in the region allowing for bound states , one finds modes whose effective mass has an imaginary part .",
    "this means that the corresponding states can not stay localized on the brane but will escape into the bulk .",
    "we have explored numerically the dependence of the real and imaginary part of the four - dimensional mass on the values of the bulk mass and of the coupling and we have given an analytical estimate of the quasi - localized modes for small values of the hubble parameter , i.e. @xmath40 .",
