    "the local group of galaxies comprises 50 or more galaxies , a majority of which are low - metallicity dwarf ones .",
    "observations of such low - metallicity galaxies provide us with a clue to an understanding of chemical characteristics of distant galaxies in the early universe , which are in a metal - poor environment .",
    "it is generally thought that metallicity has a strong impact on chemical composition of molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a metal - poor environment , not only are metal - bearing species less abundant , but production and destruction processes of molecules are expected to be different from those in a metal - rich environment . for example , photodissociation and photoionization are more effective in molecular clouds in low - metallicity conditions owing to the lower abundance of dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "thus , detailed characterization of the chemical feature in low - metallicity galaxies is of fundamental importance in astrochemistry and astrophysics .",
    "however , radio - astronomical observational studies on chemical composition of low - metallicity galaxies have so far been very sparse .",
    "molecular line emission from low - metallicity galaxies is generally faint , and hence , observations have almost been limited to co and its isotopologues .",
    "a notable exception is the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . because of its proximity to the sun ( @xmath7 kpc @xcite ) ,",

    "such a situation is also true even for low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "we recently conducted spectral line observations of molecular clouds in the lmc with the mopra 22 m telescope as the initial step to characterize molecular - cloud - scale chemical composition characteristic to low - metallicity condition @xcite .",
    "we observed seven molecular clouds , which have different star - formation activities ; two are quiescent molecular clouds which are not associated with infrared counterparts detected with _",

    "we found that the chemical compositions of the 7 sources are similar to each other regardless of the large difference of star - formation activities .",
    "since the beam size of the mopra corresponds to the spatial resolution of 10 pc at the lmc distance , the major contribution to the observed spectra is rather diffuse molecular gas extending over the molecular clouds .",
    "the contribution from the star - forming cores seems to be smeared out in the observations . in other words ,",
    "the observed chemical composition is characteristic to molecular clouds in the lmc .    by comparing the results with these observed in the metal - rich environment such as our galaxy and the spiral arm of m51 , the following two characteristics of the lmc spectra",
    "are found @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) nitrogen - bearing species ( hcn , hnc , n@xmath5h@xmath1 , hnco , cn ) are obviously faint in the lmc , which originates from the low elemental abundance of nitrogen .",
    "( 2 ) the lines of cch are relatively brighter and the lines of ch@xmath4oh are much weaker in the lmc than those in the spiral arm of m51 .",
    "moreover , the cch / hco@xmath1 ratios in the lmc are higher than those found in the nearby translucent clouds in our galaxy",
    ". this trend would originate from the stronger uv radiation field owing to the lower abundance of dust grains .",
    "we expect that these characteristics of the lmc can generally be found in other low - metallicity galaxies . to examine this prediction , we observed another low - metallicity galaxy ic10 .",
    "ic10 is located at the distance of @xmath10 950 kpc @xcite , and its metallicity is lower by factor 5 than in solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate estimated from h@xmath11 ( 0.2@xmath12 yr @xmath13 ; * ? ? ? * ) and the association of the large number of wolf - rayet stars ( @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , molecular line observations except for co and its isotopologues have not been reported .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 45 m radio telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) in february and march in 2015 . we observed the most part of the frequency range from 84 to 116 ghz .",
    "we did not observe the frequency range of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ghz , because no spectral lines were detected in the lmc sources @xcite .",

    "they correspond to the spatial scale from 71.7 to 98.8 pc at the ic10 distance ( @xmath23 kpc ) .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked by observing a nearby sio maser source ( y cas ) every hour , and the pointing accuracy was maintained to be better than @xmath24 .",
    "we observed two orthogonal polarization signals simultaneously by using the sis mixer receiver ( tz1 ) , whose system temperatures ranged from 120 to 280 k. the backend is the autocorrelator sam45 .",
    "the frequency resolution and bandwidth are 488.24 khz and 1600 mhz , respectively .",
    "we binded 2 successive channels of sam45 in the analysis to improve the signal - to - noize ratio .",
    "the resultant velocity resolution is 3.25 km s@xmath13 at 90 ghz .",
    "the line intensity was calibrated by the chopper wheel method , and a typical calibration accuracy is 20% .",
    "the antenna temperature is divided by the main beam efficiency of 0.49 at 86 ghz , 0.42 at 100 ghz , and 0.40 at 115 ghz to obtain the main beam temperature @xmath25 .",
    "we employed the position - switching mode , where the on - source integration time of each scan was set to be 20 seconds for all the observations .",

    "the off - source position is @xmath30 away in azimuth from the on - source position .",
    "the total observation time was 55 hours ( @xmath31 hours for on - source ) .",
    "a typical rms noise temperature for each line in the @xmath25 scale is @xmath32 mk for @xmath33 ghz and @xmath34 mk for @xmath35 ghz at a frequency resolution of 976.5 khz .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows the observed spectrum in the frequency range from 84 to 100 ghz , which is a part of the total observed spectrum .",
    "we detected the lines of cch(@xmath36 ) , hcn(@xmath29 ) , hco@xmath1(@xmath29 ) , hnc(@xmath29 ; tentative detection ) , cs(@xmath37 ) , and so(@xmath38 ) in this frequency range for the first time .",
    "in addition , we also detected the lines of @xmath2co(@xmath29 ) and @xmath28co(@xmath29 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the lines of @xmath3-c@xmath4h@xmath5(@xmath39 ) , n@xmath5h@xmath1(@xmath29 ) , ch@xmath4oh(@xmath40 , a@xmath1 ) , c@xmath6o(@xmath29 ) , and cn(@xmath36 ) were not detected ( figure [ eachline ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , the spectral intensity pattern is very similar to that of the molecular cloud n44c in the lmc , although the molecular line intensities are weaker by a factor of about 1/6 than that toward n44c .",
    "figure [ correlation_diagram ] ( left ) shows the integrated intensities of ic10 versus those of the lmc cloud n44c .",
    "indeed a good correlation is seen between the two sources .",
    "the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.96 .",
    "even if the @xmath2co data are excluded , it is 0.90 . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum toward ic10 significantly differs from that observed in the spiral arm of m51 .",
    "this is also confirmed by the rather poor correlation in figure [ correlation_diagram ] ( right ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.83 , while it is as low as 0.18 without @xmath2co . as mentioned in section 1 , the spectrum of n44c reflects the gmc - scale chemical composition characteristic to the lmc , and hence , the similarity seems to originate from the low - metallicity environment of ic10 .",

    "the velocity of the peak of the @xmath28co line ( @xmath41 km s@xmath13 ) is consistent with the previous observation of the @xmath28co ( @xmath29 ) line toward the same position with the arizona radio observatory 12 m telescope ( hpbw of @xmath42 ) by @xcite ( @xmath43 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the integrated intensity of @xmath28co observed by @xcite is lower than ours only by a factor of 1.3 , in spite of a large difference of the telescope beam size ( @xmath22 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "this result indicates that the @xmath28co emitting region is at least extended over the beam size of the nobeyama 45 m telescope .",
    "the @xmath45 values of the detected lines range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 km s@xmath13 , which are consistent with that of the @xmath2co line .",
    "the line widths are mostly in the range from 12 km s@xmath13 to 16 km s@xmath13 .",
    "exceptions are the hnc line and one of the cch lines ( 87.401989 ghz ) probably due to a poor signal to noise ratio ( 3.8@xmath48 ) and the blending of nearby hyperfine components , respectively ( figure [ eachline ] ) .",
    "we evaluated beam - averaged column densities by statistical equilibrium calculations , as we did for the lmc clouds @xcite .",
    "we employed the radex code @xcite for this purpose .",
    "since only one rotational transition was observed for each molecular species , we assumed a range of the gas kinetic temperature to be from 10 k to 50 k , and a range of the h@xmath5 density from @xmath49 @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xmath50 .",
    "althogh the h@xmath5 density of @xmath52 @xmath50 and @xmath53 @xmath50 are seem too high for the h@xmath5 density averaged over the 80 pc scale of molecular clouds , we assumed the wide range of the physical condition for robust estimate .",
    "the beam - averaged column densities are derived for the gas kinetic temperatures of 10 k , 20 k , 30 k , 40 k , and 50 k and the h@xmath5 density of @xmath49 @xmath50 , @xmath54 @xmath50 , @xmath55 @xmath50 , @xmath56 @xmath50 , @xmath52 @xmath50 , and @xmath51 @xmath50 , as listed in table [ columndensity ] .",
    "elemental abundances are different from galaxies to galaxies , reflecting the past history of star formation . in the low - metallicity galaxies , heavy elements are generally deficient , and in particular",
    ", the deficiency of nitrogen is the most significant among the abundant second row elements ( c , n , o ) @xcite . because of this reason , one of the characteristic features in the chemical compositions would be the deficiency of the n - bearing molecules .",
    "the chemical model by @xcite indeed predicted that abundances of n - bearing species are sensitive to the elemental abundance of nitrogen .",
    "the deficiency of the n - bearing molecules is already evident in the spectral pattern of ic10 in comparison with that of the spiral arm of m51 .",
    "we calculated the abundance ratios of hcn / hco@xmath1 and hnc / hco@xmath1 for ic10 , under the assumption of the h@xmath5 density of @xmath49 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 @xmath50 , @xmath52 , and @xmath51 @xmath50 , and the gas kinetic temperature of 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 k , and compared them with the average ratios reported for the seven clouds in the lmc @xcite , the average ratios for three translucent clouds ( cb17 , cb24 , cb228 ) in our galaxy @xcite , and the ratio for the spiral arm position ( p1 ) of m51 observed by @xcite , as shown in table [ ratio ] .",
    "the observed spectrum of ic10 are averaged over molecular clouds ( @xmath0 pc scale ) , and seems to be dominated by the diffuse part of molecular clouds rather than dense star - forming cores .",
    "this is true even for smaller - scale observations ( @xmath57 pc scale ) of the lmc clouds @xcite .",
    "hence , for fair comparison , we chose the translucent clouds as representatives of our galaxy .",
    "although the column densities are sensitive to the assumed h@xmath5 density and the assumed gas kinetic temperature , the column density ratios for ic10 are affected only less than @xmath58% in the parameter range .",
    "this fact is also shown in the analyses of the lmc spectra @xcite . the elemental n / o ratio in ic10 is lower by a factor of 3 than that in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the hcn / hco@xmath1 and hnc / hco@xmath1 ratios in ic10 are comparable to those for the lmc clouds , and are indeed found to be lower than in the three galactic translucent clouds ( cb17 , cb24 , cb228 ) .",
    "although the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios of ic10 and the galactic translucent clouds marginally overlap with each other within the mutual error ranges , the overlap occurs only for the particular conditions that is not very likely ( @xmath49 @xmath50 and 10 k for ic10 and @xmath56 @xmath50 and 50 k for the galactic translucent clouds ) .",
    "hence , we can state the above conclution in spite of the formal error ranges .",
    "a similar comparison can also be made for m51 p1 , which has the higher n / o ratio than the solar neighborhood by a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "the hcn / hco@xmath1 and hnc / hco@xmath1 ratios in m51 p1 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , which are higher than those in ic10 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) .",
    "hence , it is most likely that the deficiency of the n - bearing molecules directly reflects the elemental deficiency of nitrogen in the ic10 .",
    "the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio has been discussed for nuclear regions of external galaxies .",
    "the hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio is known to be higher for the agns , which is interpreted as the effect of xdrs , cosmic - rays , and/or shock heatings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this study , we observed gmcs without such effects , and found the lower hcn / hco@xmath1 ratio than the galactic translucent clouds .",
    "hence , the various effects suggested for the agns can not be applied to ic10 .",
    "rather , the intrinsic effect of the elemental abundance can be seen in this source .",
    "the cs / so ratio in ic10 is @xmath63 , which is comparable to that of the lmc ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the ratio is also comparable to that in the galactic translucent clouds ( @xmath65 ) , but is lower than that of m51 p1 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "any significant trend due to the difference of the c / o ratio is not seen in the cs / so ratio in this study .",
    "we calculated the abundance ratio of cch / hco@xmath1 in the same way as hcn / hco@xmath1 and hnc / hco@xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of cch / hco@xmath1 is higher in ic10 ( @xmath67 ) than in the galactic translucent clouds ( @xmath68 ) by a factor of 4 .",
    "this enhancement of cch in ic10 can not be interpreted as the effect of elemental abundances .",
    "indeed , the elemental c / o ratio is estimated to be 0.3 in ic10 @xcite , while it is 0.6 in solar neighborhood . when the low c / o ratio is taken into account ,",
    "the high cch / hco@xmath1 ratio in ic10 is striking .",
    "this enhancement of cch is also seen in the lmc clouds @xcite .",
    "the effect of photodissociation would be responsible for the enhancement .",
    "it is generally thought that cch is abundant in the photodissociation region ( pdr ) illuminated by uv radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in low - metallicity galaxies ,",
    "the extinction of the uv radiation by dust grains is expected to be less effective for a given column density of h@xmath5 because of the lower abundance of dust grains .",
    "the pdr would be extended deeper into molecular clouds , which would be responsible to the relatively high abundance of cch . in the pdr ,",
    "the growth of large carbon - chain molecules containing more than three carbon atoms are generally suppressed by competitive photodissociation processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath3-c@xmath4h@xmath5/cch ratio is indeed found to be less than 0.1 both in ic10 the lmc clouds , which is lower than that observed in the galactic translucent clouds ( 0.22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio is rather consistent with the ratio in some galactic diffuse clouds observed in absorption against the bright continuum sources ( 0.04 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ratio in m82 which also hosts extended pdrs ( 0.04 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this fact further supports the extended pdr in the low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "non - detection of ch@xmath4oh is notable , as in the case of the lmc clouds @xcite .",
    "we obtained the upper limits of the ch@xmath4oh intensity and the column density in ic10 .",
    "the abundance ratio of ch@xmath4oh / hco@xmath1 in ic10 is @xmath69 , which seems lower than that found in m51 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this result can also be interpreted in terms of a stronger uv effect owing to low abundance of dust grains in ic10 .",
    "ch@xmath4oh is thought to be produced by hydrogenation of co on dust grains , and is liberated into the gas phase by thermal and/or non - thermal desorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a low abundance of dust grains tends to make the ch@xmath4oh formation inefficient .",
    "furthermore , laboratory experiments show that the efficiency of ch@xmath4oh formation significantly decreases at the temperature higher than 20 k due to a fall of striking probability of hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "since the temperature of cloud peripheries is expected to be higher in the low - metallicity condition due to penetration of the uv radiation , ch@xmath4oh would not be formed efficiently . according to @xcite ,",
    "the lower abundance of ch@xmath4oh ice observed in the lmc may be also caused by a relatively high dust temperature .",
    "their result is consistent with ours .",
    "we also evaluated the hnc / hcn ratio in ic10 to be @xmath71 , which is comparable to the ratio in the lmc clouds , and is lower than the ratio in typical dark clouds ( @xmath72 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the solar neighborhood .",
    "it is close to the ratio reported in some galactic diffuse clouds , where the hcn and hnc lines are detected in absorption against bright continuum sources ( @xmath73 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported that the hnc / hcn ratio is lower under higher - temperature environments : the ratio decreases above 24 k , possibly reflecting isomerization mechanisms of hnc to hcn .",
    "the relatively low ratios observed in ic10 and the lmc clouds may also originate from warmer temperature conditions due to higher uv field and/or lower grain abundance .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting non - detection of n@xmath5h@xmath1 .",
    "this seems to originate mainly from the low elemental abundance of nitrogen . in addition",
    ", the uv radiation may also contribute to the low - abundance of n@xmath5h@xmath1 .",
    "deeper penetration of uv radiation enhances the abundance of atomic ion and electrons , which efficiently destroys n@xmath5h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the molecular - cloud - scale chemical composition of ic10 is found to be very similar to that of the lmc clouds .",
    "it is characterized by deficiency of n - bearing molecules , relatively high abundant cch , and deficiency of ch@xmath4oh .",
    "hence , these chemical features can be regarded as ones characteristic in low - metallicity galaxies , although they have to be further examined in other galaxies with various metallicities .",
    "furthermore , more sensitive observations are needed to detect larger molecules and explore the molecular evolution in low - metallicity galaxies .",
