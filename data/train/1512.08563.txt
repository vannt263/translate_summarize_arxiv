    "the study of weak @xmath1 decays is turning into an unexpected very valuable source of information on hadron dynamics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays into @xmath6 and a pair of pions brought surprises showing that in the @xmath7 decay the two pions produced a big signal of the @xmath8 resonance and no trace of the @xmath9 @xcite , while in the @xmath10 decay the two pions contributed strongly in the @xmath9 region and made only a small contribution in the @xmath8 region @xcite .",
    "a study of these processes taking into account explicitly the final state interaction of the pions , together with its coupled channels , gave a good interpretation of these features @xcite , providing support for the picture of the chiral unitary approach , where these two resonances emerge as a consequence of the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons in coupled channels @xcite .",
    "similarly , the study of @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays into @xmath6 and a vector meson @xcite gave support to the picture in which the vector mesons are basically made of @xmath11 @xcite .    for the @xmath12 decays ,",
    "only upper bounds for their branching ratios of the order of @xmath13 are available so far @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of these decays are available and they use the naive factorization , or qcd factorization @xcite , perturbative qcd with the @xmath14 factorization @xcite , or other kinds of factorization approximations @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we address the problem in a different way , establishing a link to the @xmath15 decays , with v a vector meson , which were studied in @xcite .",
    "the link to the @xmath12 is then established by converting the vector meson v into a photon , using for it the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) hypothesis @xcite , which is most practically implemented using the local hidden gauge approach @xcite . the intricate form factors stemming from the weak decay and qcd matrix elements are taken into account by using the experimental value of the @xmath16 decay width . this new way of addressing the problem provides rates which should be rather accurate , and they come at a moment where the rates obtained from the other theoretical approaches differ sometimes by two orders of magnitude .",
    "also significant is the fact that , while the rates obtained are below the present upper bounds , the branching ratio for @xmath17 is only one order of magnitude smaller than the present experimental bound .",
    "this should serve as a motivation to push the experimental limits to get absolute values for this rate that could shed some light on the theoretical methods to address the problem .",
    "more problematic is the @xmath18 decay , where we predict a rate about two orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental bound , but should this rate be measured it would also help us understand better the relevant physics behind these processes .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the formalism .",
    "iii considers further theoretical uncertainties and compares the final results with those of other theoretical approaches .",
    "we finish with some conclusions in sec .",
    "the idea that we follow is to link the @xmath19 and @xmath20 reactions to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 by converting the neutral vector mesons into a photon . for this purpose",
    "we use the sakurai vmd hypothesis  @xcite , which is most practically implemented using the local hidden gauge approach  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 production is addressed following the work of @xcite , which we describe briefly below .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 decay mechanisms at the quark level are given in fig .",
    "[ bdecay ]  @xcite .",
    "the first thing to note is that in diagram ( a ) for the @xmath25 decay one has the quark transition @xmath27 , which requires the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element , @xmath28 , and hence is cabibbo suppressed . on the other hand , in the decay of @xmath29 , diagram ( b ) , one has the @xmath30 transition that goes with the ckm matrix element @xmath31 , and hence the process is cabibbo favored . in both decays we create a @xmath32 pair that will make the @xmath6 meson and an extra pair of quarks , @xmath33 in the @xmath25 decay and @xmath34 in the @xmath26 decay . in @xcite",
    "this extra pair of quarks is hadronized , including a further @xmath35 pair with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , in order to have two mesons in the final state , in addition to the @xmath6 .",
    "but here we are interested in the production of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 in addition to the @xmath6 .",
    "then it is most opportune to mention that the studies conducted to determine the nature of mesons in terms of quarks conclude that the low - lying scalar mesons come from the interaction of pseudoscalars , but the low - lying vector mesons are basically @xmath35 states .",
    "this has been thoroughly tested by using large @xmath39 arguments in @xcite or applying an extension of the compositeness weinberg sum rule  @xcite to states not so close to threshold  @xcite and in particular in @xmath40 partial waves  @xcite . indeed , in @xcite , using experimental data and the generalized sum rule ,",
    "one concludes that the amount of @xmath41 in the @xmath36 wave function is very small , of the order of 10% .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained for the @xmath42 component in the @xmath43 in @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath35 component is the basic one in the wave function of the vector mesons and we shall adhere to this picture . in view of this , from fig .",

    "on the other hand , diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , described as long range in @xcite , all can lead to @xmath6 in the final state through the combination of @xmath32 .",

    "these two structures are explicitly used in the theoretical works  @xcite .    for the case of @xmath75 in the final state ,",
    "the two structures guarantee gauge invariance , but for the case of @xmath121 such restriction is not necessary in principle .",

    "while this can be a reasonable approach , we would like to recall that a systematic study of the @xmath121 and @xmath75 processes using the local hidden gauge approach  @xcite to deal with vector mesons and their interaction produces gauge invariant amplitudes after the @xmath75 conversion via eq .",
