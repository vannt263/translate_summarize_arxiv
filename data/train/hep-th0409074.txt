    "an outstanding consequence of maldacena s duality  @xcite between 10-dimensional string theory on @xmath5 and yang - mills theories at its conformal 3 + 1 spacetime boundary  @xcite is the potential to describe processes for physical qcd which are valid at strong coupling and do not rely on perturbation theory . as shown by polchinski and strassler  @xcite , dimensional counting rules  @xcite for the leading power - law fall - off of hard exclusive glueball scattering",
    "can be derived from a gauge theory with a mass gap dual to supergravity in warped spacetimes .",
    "the modified theory generates the hard behavior expected from qcd , instead of the soft behavior characteristic of strings .",
    "other examples are the description of form factors at large transverse momentum  @xcite and deep inelastic scattering  @xcite . the discussion of scaling laws in warped backgrounds has also been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft duality gives a non - perturbative definition of quantum gravity in a curved background which is asymptotic to a product of anti - de sitter space ads and a compact einstein space @xmath6 .",
    "as originally formulated  @xcite , a correspondence was established between the supergravity approximation to type iib string theory , and the large @xmath4 brane decoupling limit with gauge dynamics corresponding to @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) in four dimensions .",
    "the bulk geometry has exact conformal geometry @xmath5 in the near - horizon region @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radius of ads and the radius of the five - sphere .",
    "the extra five dimensions of @xmath9 correspond to the @xmath10 global symmetry which rotates the particles present in the sym supermultiplet in the adjoint representation of @xmath11 .",
    "the conformal group @xmath12 is identified with the isometry group of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with the isometries of @xmath9 .",
    "the supergravity duality requires a large value of @xmath15 corresponding to a large value of the t hooft parameter , @xmath16  @xcite .    in a recent attempt to extend the glueball results to hadrons  @xcite",
    ", we used the ads / cft correspondence to determine the basic properties of hadronic light - front wavefunctions ( lfwf ) in qcd based on the underlying conformal symmetry of the duality for pointlike hard - scattering processes which occur in the large-@xmath17 region of ads space .",
    "the scaling behavior of the string modes determine the behavior of the qcd hadronic wavefunction , giving a precise counting rule for each fock component state with an arbitrary number of quarks and gluons and internal orbital angular momentum .",
    "the discussion was carried out in terms of the lowest dimensions of interpolating fields near the boundary of ads , treating the boundary values of the string states @xmath1 as a product of quantized operators which create @xmath18-partonic states out of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "our ads / cft derivation validate qcd perturbative results and confirm the dominance of the quark interchange mechanism  @xcite for exclusive qcd processes at large @xmath4 .",
    "the predicted orbital dependence coincides with the fall - off of light - front fock wavefunctions derived in perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "since all of the fock states of the lfwf beyond the valence state are a manifestation of quantum fluctuations , it is natural to match quanta to quanta the additional dimensions with the metric fluctuations of the bulk geometry about the fixed ads background .    for large values of @xmath15 , or small curvature of ads space , it is expected that the dual of a yang mills theory is classical gravity .",
    "the correspondence also implies that the dual of strongly coupled qcd is a weakly coupled string .",
    "since qcd is weakly coupled at high energies , the dual theory is expected to be a strongly coupled string model at small t hooft coupling and would require the understanding of strings in highly curved backgrounds , extending the semiclassical approximation to include quantum effects on the string theory side .",
    "the behavior of string states in the infrared region is dependent on dynamics at small-@xmath17 , and it is a priori unknown .",
    "non - conformal aspects are needed to make contact with the real world .",
    "the introduction of quarks in the fundamental representation is also crucial , requiring an open string sector .    in spite of the difficulties mentioned above",
    ", important progress has been achieved by extending the ads / cft correspondence beyond the supergravity approximation to construct string duals to non - conformal gauge theories .",
    "even if the detailed form of the metric at small-@xmath17 is unknown , salient qcd dynamical features , such as the generation of a mass gap and a hadron spectrum , will follow from the deformation of the ads conformal background at small @xmath17 . indeed from  @xcite",
    "there follows a simple relation between the 10-dimensional string scale @xmath19 and the yang - mills 4-dimensional scale @xmath20 in a warped space : @xmath21 , where the cutoff @xmath22 , breaks conformal invariance and allows the introduction of the qcd scale .",
    "a physical hadron in four - dimensional minkowski space has four - momentum @xmath23 and hadronic invariant mass states given by @xmath24 .",
    "the string wavefunction in @xmath17 is the extension of the baryon wavefunction into the fifth dimension : we thus analytically match the three - quark proton wavefunction in @xmath25 space to its corresponding string wavefunction using the 10-dimensional wave equation .",
    "different values of @xmath17 correspond to different energy scales at which the hadron is examined .",
    "in particular , the @xmath26 boundary corresponds to the @xmath27 , zero separation limit .",
    "the physical string modes @xmath28 are plane waves along the poincar coordinates , and @xmath29 is a function of the transverse coordinates @xmath30 . for large-@xmath17 , @xmath31 scale as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the conformal dimension of the string state , the same dimension of the interpolating operator which creates a hadron out of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the string modes are coupled to the matter fields of the conformal theory as determined by the boundary limit between the string partition function and the generating functional of the quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "for example , the quantum numbers of each baryon , including intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum , are determined by matching the dimensions of the string modes @xmath1 , with the lowest dimension of the baryonic interpolating operators in the conformal limit .",
    "although the underlying string theory dual to @xmath34 is unknown , the introduction of quark fields in the fundamental representation and the symmetries in the asymptotic boundary , should provide the conditions required to establish a precise matching between the string modes in the semiclassical gravity approximation and boundary states with well defined number of partons .",
    "in particular , the known light baryons are dual to spin-@xmath35 and spin-@xmath36 strings and consequently there is not a vastly large mass gap between baryons with total angular momentum @xmath37 and @xmath38 for large @xmath4 .    after stating in sec .",
    "2 some basic properties of the correspondence between string modes in ads space and baryon states at the asymptotic boundary , we confront our results with the spectrum of nucleon and @xmath33 orbital resonances in sec .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "a precise statement of the duality between a string / gravity theory on a @xmath39-dimensional anti - de sitter space @xmath40 and the large @xmath4 limit of a conformal theory at its @xmath41-dimensional boundary , is given formally in terms of the full partition function of the string theory in the bulk @xmath42 which should coincide with the generating functional of the conformal field theory @xmath43 on the ads boundary  @xcite : @xmath44 = z_{cft}\\left[\\psi_o\\right]$ ] .",
    "for spin-@xmath35 dilatino in the bulk , the duality involves positive and negative chirality components  @xcite @xmath45 , which couple with cft operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 =   \\left\\langle\\exp{\\left(i\\int d^d x \\left[{\\overline{\\mathcal{o}}}^- \\psi_o^-        + { \\overline{\\psi}}_o^+ \\mathcal{o}^+ \\right ] \\right)}\\right\\rangle.\\ ] ]    near the boundary of ads , @xmath49 , the independent solutions of the 10-dimensional dirac equation are @xmath50 the solution with @xmath51 dominates near @xmath52 , thus @xmath53 .",
    "the field @xmath54 acts as a boundary source , and @xmath55 is the response function which incorporates the quantum fluctuations . the boundary sources for positive and negative chirality @xmath56 and @xmath57 have dimensions @xmath58 . consequently the dimension of the cft operators @xmath46 and @xmath59 is @xmath60 . since the dimension of @xmath61 is also @xmath60 , we expect that @xmath55 is related to the expectation value of @xmath62 in the presence of the source @xmath63 : @xmath64 . indeed",
    "@xmath65  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath61 acts as a semiclassical field and is the boundary limit of the normalizable string solution .",

    "qcd is fundamentally different from sym theories where matter fields appear in adjoint multiplets of @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0 theory is dual to the low energy supergravity approximation to type iib string  @xcite compactified on @xmath5 .",
    "the sym fields correspond to closed strings and comprise a gluon field , six scalars , four majorana gluinos , and their antiparticles .",

    "the sym particles are expected to acquire a mass of the order of susy breaking scale and decouple from the theory .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence is interpreted in the present context as a classical duality between the lowest three - quark valence state in the asymptotic @xmath25 boundary and the lowest string mode in @xmath5 .",
    "higher fock components are a manifestation of the quantum fluctuations of qcd and are conformal states in the limit of massless quarks and vanishing qcd @xmath114-function  @xcite .",
    "metric fluctuations of the bulk geometry about the fixed ads background should correspond to quantum fluctuations of fock states above the valence state in the limit where qcd appears nearly conformal .",
    "as shown by gubser , klebanov and polyakov , orbital excitations in the boundary correspond to string degrees of freedom propagating in the bulk from quantum fluctuations in the ads sector  @xcite .",
    "consider a gauge invariant interpolating operator which creates an arbitrary fock - state in the boundary @xmath115 where the @xmath116 derivatives determine the total spacetime orbital angular momentum , @xmath117 .",
    "the conformal dimension of ( [ eq : ibo ] ) is @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the sum of the dimensions of the quarks , antiquarks and gluons of the fock component .",
    "an effective five - dimensional mass @xmath120 in the ads wave equation corresponding to quantum excitations about the fixed ads metric is asymptotically determined by spectral comparison of the string modes and the boundary operators of qcd , while maintaining conformal invariance .",
    "matching the dimension of the fock components at the minkowski boundary we find the relation @xmath121 .",
    "thus , an @xmath122 quantum orbital at the minkowski boundary corresponds to a five - dimensional mass @xmath123 in the bulk side . the four - dimensional mass spectrum @xmath124 is determined by imposing boundary conditions on one of the solutions of the dirac equation @xmath125 .",
    "the solution of the spin-@xmath36 rarita - schwinger equation in ads space is more involved , but considerable simplification occurs for polarization along minkowski coordinates , @xmath126 , where it becomes similar to the spin-@xmath35 solution  @xcite .",
    "the study of the hadron spectrum is crucial for our understanding of bound states of strongly interacting relativistic confined particles .",
    "different qcd - based models often disagree , even in the identification of the relevant degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "studies of orbitally excited baryons based on the @xmath127 expansion have been useful for identifying the relevant effective operators and determine their relative importance  @xcite .",
    "an outstanding puzzle is that the spin - orbit splitting , which experimentally is very small , appear in the @xmath127 expansion as a zeroth - order effect .",
    "recently , the computation of orbital excitations on the lattice has been extended up to spin-@xmath128 states  @xcite .",

    "we limit ourselves to the light unflavored hadron states and the introduction of massless quarks .",

    "<S> we have computed the baryon spectrum in the context of @xmath0 super - conformal yang - mills theory using ads / cft duality . </S>",
    "<S> baryons are included in the theory by adding an open string sector , corresponding to quarks in the fundamental and higher representations . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron mass scale is introduced by imposing boundary conditions at the wall at the end of ads space . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum numbers of each baryon , are identified by matching the fall - off of the string wavefunction @xmath1 at the asymptotic @xmath2 boundary to the operator dimension of the lowest three - quark fock state , subject to appropriate boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> higher fock states are matched quanta to quanta with quantum fluctuations of the bulk geometry about the fixed ads background , maintaining conformal invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting four - dimensional spectrum displays a remarkable resemblance to the physical baryon spectrum of qcd , including the suppression of spin - orbit interactions .    </S>",
