    "the central velocity is the heliocentric velocity measured at the midpoint of the 20% flux level .",
    "the width of emission is measured at the 20% and 50% levels ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ) .",

    "we also consider a feature to be detected if its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) spans at least 10 velocity channels and it has a peak - to - rms @xmath26 .",
    "these absorption features are quantified using the gbtidl task _ fitgauss _ , with one gaussian component at a time added to a spectrum until the residuals are statistically featureless . with the exception of pg  1119 + 120 , where a narrow absorption feature is present within the emission profile ,",

    "the column density is then calculated as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spin temperature . in this paper",
    ", we will assume a spin temperature of 1000  k ( see section  [ sec : mdot ] ) . for absorption features in pg  1119 + 120 ,",
    "pg  1244 + 026 , and pg  1440 + 356 , the absorption troughs are deeper than their nuclear continua , suggesting that sources of continuum emission extend beyond the nucleus .",
    "table  [ tab : absorption ] summarizes the measured and derived values for all of the detected absorption features .    as a reality check",
    ", we inspected the data to confirm that the choice of polynomial order for the baseline fitting does not affect the detection of absorption or emission .",
    "specifically , we examined whether polynomial orders of 3 or 5 can introduce ripples into the data that masquerade as absorption or emission features . after repeating the baseline subtraction for our data using a range of polynomial orders ( 15 )",
    ", we confirm that the same spectral features are still detected , even for marginal detections such as that in f041032838 .",
    "the measured widths and velocities are in agreement with those measured with the best - fit baseline to within the errors .",
    "therefore , we are confident that even the weak detections noted as `` marginal '' in tables  [ tab : emission ] and [ tab : absorption ] are real .",
    "the individual hi profiles of our targets are discussed in the appendix . in general , we see hi trends along the merger sequence but no correlation with infrared luminosity .",
    "all of the detected ulirgs show hi absorption , typically with multiple velocity components , many of which are narrow ( fwhm @xmath35  km  s@xmath2 ) and some of which are redshifted .",
    "only 2/7 ( 29% ) of the detected ulirgs have hi emission .",
    "the different velocity absorption components have different origins and are not necessarily caused by outflows or infall ; kinematics of circumnuclear gas disks may mimic the properties of outflows or infall in single dish data .",
    "in a couple of cases , such as ugc  05101 and mrk  273 , the absorption profiles are nearly symmetrical about zero velocity . for the type  2 agn ugc  05101",
    ", the profile is likely from absorption due to a slightly inclined rotating hi disk superposed on an obscured nucleus .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with co maps of ugc  05101 showing smooth , regular rotation of the molecular gas @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the co velocity field of mrk  273 is very distorted @xcite , so it is unlikely that the gas is in well - ordered disk - like rotation .",
    "the double absorption in hi seen in mrk  273 probably corresponds to the binary obscured nuclei in this object .",
    "thus , co maps can help eliminate gas disks as the origin of the absorption features . however , only a few galaxies in our sample have readily available co maps so direct comparisons are difficult .",
    "comparison of single dish co and hi profiles for the quest targets is on - going , but it is beyond the scope of the present paper . the more complex profiles , such as those seen in f15250 + 3608 , f051892524 , and f151301938 , may be interpreted as multiple infalling or outflowing components .",
    "they may also result from the superposition of an emission profile and a broad absorption profile .",
    "the latter case is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : decompose ] .",
    "in contrast , the hi profiles of the fir - strong quasars are generally detected not only in absorption ( 88% or 7 of the 8 detected sources ) but also in emission ( 75% ) .",
    "the absorption features are on average @xmath360  km  s@xmath2 broader than those seen in ulirgs or approximately three times greater than the typical fwhm measurement error in the ulirgs . both redshifted and blueshifted absorption features are seen , although the systemic velocities of these systems are uncertain . optical emission lines may underestimate recessional velocity since some fraction of the line emission may arise from outflowing material . in the case of pg  0050 + 124",
    "( i zw 1 ) , this effect causes a shift of @xmath3700  km  s@xmath2 ( see appendix ) .",
    "a similar situation could also hold for pg  1440 + 356 . in three cases ,",
    "pg  1119 + 120 , pg  1244 + 026 , and pg  1440 + 356 , the minima of the absorption troughs exceed the nuclear continuum flux densities .",
    "this discrepancy implies that off - nuclear emission , not accounted for in the nuclear fluxes of table  [ tab : sample ] , also contributes to the continuum emission in these four sources .",
    "given resolution limit of the vla core measurements of pg  1119 + 120 and pg  1440 + 356 , the off - nuclear emission must be at least @xmath32030  kpc from the core ; for pg  1244 + 026 , the separation from the core must be at least 3 kpc . while we can not formally rule out the possibility that these absorption features are absorption of hi against continuum from background quasars , this possibility is statistically unlikely .",
    "another possibility is that the flux densities of the cores in these galaxies are time variable as exemplified by the variability of the core in pg  1351 + 640 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the hi profiles of the fir - weak quasars are different from those of the ulirgs and fir - strong quasars .",
    "hi is seen mostly in emission ( 88% or 7 of 8 detected sources ) , and only 25% ( 2/8 ) show broad absorption .",
    "the emission profiles are very broad ( @xmath36500  km  s@xmath2 ) and bumpy , perhaps beginning to resemble those of regularly rotating disks that typically display gaussian or double - horned profiles ; the measured widths and velocities are consistent with previous measurements of quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these properties will be revisited in section  [ sec : decompose ] .",
    "considering now our entire hi sample , the distribution of equivalent widths ( ew ; defined as the integrated flux density for each component divided by the continuum flux density of the core ) is plotted in figure  [ fig : ew_dist ] . for this definition ,",
    "the equivalent widths of the absorption components are negative .",
    "it is clear that the strengths of the emission and absorption features progress along the merger sequence , with ulirgs having the weakest features , the fir - strong quasars having the strongest absorption features , and the fir - weak quasars having the strongest emission features . in figure",
    "[ fig : fwhmvsfr ] , we compare the fwhms of emission and absorption with the star formation rates of their host galaxies . for emission ,",
    "the fir - weak sources have the broadest widths , the ulirgs have the narrowest widths , and the fir - strong quasars bridge the gap between those two classes . in the ulirgs , there appears to be a weak correlation between the width of the absorption components and the sfr , reminiscent of a similar relationship seen in na  i @xcite .",
    "however , given that multiple absorption components are associated with a single system ( and thus a single sfr value ) , the validity of the connection between the sfr and the fwhm of the absorption components in ulirgs is uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "absorption fwhm is not at all related to sfr in the quasars , further suggesting that the agn play a role in these systems .",
    "an unexpected outcome of our gbt program is that many of the absorption features show a dependence on polarization ( figure  [ fig : polspecs ] ) . indeed ,",
    "13 of our 23 gbt - detected targets show some profile difference in their two polarizations ( 1 ulirg , 7 ir - excess quasars , and 5 optical quasars ) . for gbt observations",
    ", it is expected that there is a @xmath376% difference between polarizations in terms of normalization , but the observed spectral shapes should be the same in both polarizations ( r. maddalena , private comm . ) .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by the fact that our m82 data remain in agreement after baseline subtraction .",
    "polarization variation in our quest sample is not rfi - related , as we have removed time intervals where the data are affected by broadband rfi . since it is improbable that the hi screen itself is polarized ,",
    "the underlying continuum emission must be polarized .",
    "the most dramatic examples of polarized spectra are seen in pg  1211 + 143 and pg  1440 + 356 .",
    "not only are these spectra polarized , but they are also time variable on timescales of @xmath330 minutes ( figures  [ fig : pg1211var ] and [ fig : pg1440var ] ) .",
    "in fact , of our radio - detected sample galaxies , time variability is only seen in sources that have significant absorption and spectra that are significantly polarized .",
    "a possible concern is that since we observed these sources over several sessions , variability could be an instrumental effect .",
    "however , comparing the different sessions data for m82 , we find that time variability and polarization are not seen beyond what is expected of typical gbt observations .",
    "moreover , session - to - session instrumental variability would not explain the 30-minute variability seen within the same observing session .",
    "time varying polarizations are not seen only in the targets with the brightest continua , so the variations are not likely to be due to instrumental systematics from poor cancellation of baseline ripples in the position - switching scans @xcite",
    ".    a different sort of instrumental effect may be leakage of linear polarization from the linearly polarized background continuum into the total intensity of the absorption profiles .",
    "we can not yet exclude this scenario since these observations were not designed for polarimetry and our current data lack the cross - correlated products ( xy and yx ) that would be needed to confirm these time variations .",
    "if these time variations are real , they could be caused by one of several processes .",
    "first , they could be due to variations in the compact continuum sources behind the hi screen .",
    "as the x - ray light curves of pg  1211 + 143 and pg  1440 + 356 show ( figure  [ fig : xrayvar ] ) , the x - ray emitting central region can be highly variable on a timescale of about 30 minutes .",
    "although not contemporaneous with our gbt data , these x - ray data suggest that the agn continuum can vary on a 30-minute time scale if the radio continuum is indeed related to the x - ray producing regions .",
    "however , if the polarization - dependent variations are simply a result of the changing compact source continuum , then we would expect the continuum to vary in block and would observe a change in the equivalent width of the hi absorption , not the frequency - dependent variations we see in these targets .",
    "second , variability could be a result of changes in the structure of the hi screen .",
    "however , the timescale for the destruction of small hi clouds in the interstellar medium is on the order of a myr , depending on the exact properties of the interstellar medium causing the absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is therefore unlikely that cloud destruction causes the observed short - term variations .",
    "similarly , it is unlikely that the movement of hi clouds into and out of our line of sight to the continuum source can cause the very broad variations observed in these objects .",
    "the time variability of the polarization - dependent hi absorption is easier to explain if the polarized continuum emission comes from both the nuclear source and an extended source ( e.g. , radio jets ) . in this picture",
    "( figure  [ fig : gbtlos ] ) , the hi screen is also extended , covering both the nuclear source and extended jets with kinematically distinct clouds .",
    "as the central source fluctuates , the ratio of central - to - jet emission also changes , resulting in the observed wavelength - dependent polarization variations . in this scenario",
    ", there is no need for the structure of the hi screen to change on a fast timescale .",
    "regardless of whether the time variability is real , it is certainly the case that the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : polspecs ] are polarized .",
    "again , we checked for baseline - subtraction - related effects on the detection of polarized absorption and found that the choice of the polynomial order of the baseline fit matters little to the detection of these polarization - dependent absorption features .",
    "the most obvious example of polarization not due to observational systematics is seen in the spectra of pg  0050 + 124 ( i zw 1 ) .",
    "this hi profile is not polarized at relative velocities of 5001000  km  s@xmath2 but becomes polarization - dependent between relative velocities 500 and + 500  km  s@xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : polspecs ] ) .",
    "this behavior argues against attribution of apparent polarization dependencies to poor baseline subtraction or session - to - session variations in our gbt observations .",
    "at least in this one case , the polarization dependence must be due to something physically happening at relative velocities between 500 and + 500  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "when we compare the hi profiles of each galaxy in the two separate polarizations , it appears that one polarization typically has higher flux than the other , with the exception of pg  1440 + 356 , in which there is a velocity shift instead .",
    "the effect is not systematic in the sense that one polarization is always higher than the other ; each is nearly equally likely to be the polarization with the higher intensity . in some cases , particularly in pg  1351 + 640 and pg  1411 + 442",
    ", the lower - intensity profile appears to be the same as the higher - intensity profile with the addition of a broad absorption component .    to follow up on this intriguing hint , we produced the difference spectra ( the spectrum in the polarization with the more negative hi profile minus the spectrum in the polarization with the more positive hi profile ) shown in figure  [ fig : diffspecs ] .",
    "the absorption features in these spectra are then modeled the same way as before , using the gbtidl task _ fitgauss_. when these absorption models are included , many of the full intensity spectra that need multiple components to explain the blue- and red - shifted components can be explained simply by hi emission that is combined with a single broad absorption component .",
    "this pattern is most obvious in pg  1351 + 640 and pg  1411 + 442 .",
    "the results of this type of complex decomposition of the spectra are provided in tables  [ tab : complex_emission ] and [ tab : complex_absorption ] .",
    "similar decompositions can explain the shapes of the full intensity spectra of the ulirgs f051892524 and f151301958 , and the fir - strong quasar pg  1244 + 026 .",
    "however , since those spectra are not polarized , we can not create difference spectra to model the broad absorption component .",
    "task statistically prefers the multiple - component models to the single - absorption model for these spectra .",
    "overall , with the exception of pg  1501 + 106 , the decompositions result in stronger features in both absorption and emission .    given the results of this exercise , we find the instances of hi absorption ( emission ) to be 100% ( 29% ) in detected ulirgs , 100% ( 88% ) in fir - strong quasars , and 63% ( 100% ) in fir - weak quasars . the more complex decomposition of the spectra does not drastically change the distribution of ews ( figure  [ fig : ew_dist_com ] ) compared to figure  [ fig : ew_dist ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : fwhmvsfr_com ] provides a comparison of the fwhms of the emission and absorption features from the complex modeling with the star formation rates of these galaxies . as in figure",
    "[ fig : fwhmvsfr ] , the fir - weak quasars have the broadest emission features and the ulirgs have the narrowest emission features . in terms of absorption",
    ", there is no obvious relationship between the absorption feature widths and the star formation rates .",
    "as before , the fir - weak quasars have the broadest absorption features , with the fir - strong quasars spanning the range of widths between fir - weak quasars and ulirgs .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : profiles ] , the absorption components are not necessarily caused by infall or outflow .",
    "it is possible , as seen in ugc  05101 ( edge on ) and mrk  231 ( face on ) , that these features can be associated with the kinematics of gas disks .",
    "a circumnuclear gas disk seen nearly edge on with a non - isotropic gas mass ( or background continuum ) distribution can mimic characteristics of infall and outflow .",
    "unfortunately , our single dish data can not unambiguously exclude gas disks as the source of the features we observe , but it is unlikely that all of our targets with absorption features have gas disks that are seen precisely edge - on .    keeping this caveat in mind ,",
    "we assume in the following discussion an outflow origin only for blueshifted hi absorption features with hi - corrected heliocentric velocities ( @xmath38 for more details .",
    "a remaining source of uncertainty in the interpretation of hi line profiles is the question of whether the midpoint of the 20% flux level is always a good approximation of the true systemic velocity .",
    "emission from molecular lines is a more reliable tracer of systemic velocity than hi , so the ideal solution here would be acquisition of single - dish co spectroscopy for the full quest sample . unfortunately , these observations are still pending . ] ) below 50  km  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain such hi outflows .",
    "they include adiabatically expanding broad emission line clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , starburst- and agn - driven galactic winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and agn - driven jets interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these mechanisms predict different outflow locations ( from parsec to kiloparsec scales ) and geometries ( wide angled vs. collimated ) .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the mass outflowing ( @xmath39 ) at a velocity @xmath40 is calculated using :    @xmath41    assuming spherical geometry , mass conservation , and a wind that flows from a distance of @xmath42 to infinity .",
    "the outflow is also assumed to subtend a solid angle of @xmath43 within which the gas has a covering fraction of 1 .",
    "to facilitate comparisons with the values derived from young radio galaxies by @xcite , we use the same assumptions of @xmath44 and @xmath45  kpc . applying these assumptions and equation  5 to the blueshifted absorption components where @xmath46",
    ", we find mass outflow rates @xmath39  ( wide ) up to more than 6000  @xmath6  yr@xmath2 ( summarized in table  [ tab : outflows ] ) .",
    "these values are much larger than those of @xmath3760  @xmath6  yr@xmath2 measured by @xcite and the range measured in ulirgs ( 13133  @xmath6  yr@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of the mass outflow rates we infer seem unrealistically large ; such high rates have not been measured in other astrophysical objects .",
    "these values do , however , depend on the assumptions we have made above .",
    "the mass outflow rate depends linearly on the size scale of the outflow region and the derived hi column density .",
    "recall from equation  4 that the column density depends on the spin temperature and optical depth profile , which in turn depends on the brightness of the background continuum .",
    "there are thus three key factors that affect our estimates of a mass outflow rate : the spin temperature of the gas , the assumed distance , and the background continuum .",
    "the assumption of 1000  k for the hi spin temperature seems to be reasonably conservative . in the vicinity of powerful agn ,",
    "the extreme conditions of the gas and the presence of shocks can result in spin temperatures @xmath473000  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we note that absorption - line opacity will be dominated by the coldest material in any multiphase medium .",
    "spatially resolved interferometric maps of several quasars suggest that the outflow regions have size scales @xmath30.21.6  kpc @xcite . adopting the smaller distance of 0.2  kpc instead of 1  kpc would reduce the derived mass outflow rates by a factor of 5 , more consistent with those derived for ulirgs .",
    "finally , the estimated hi column density also depends strongly on the geometry of the source of continuum emission .",
    "we have assumed that this emission comes entirely from the core . however , the absorption troughs in several quasars in our sample are deeper than the core fluxes .",
    "this excess implies that off - nuclear emission also contributes to the observed continuum . in this case , @xmath28 in equation  ( 3 ) is overestimated and so is @xmath29 , by a factor equal to the actual nuclear / total continuum flux ratio , although a larger source size may compensate to some extent .",
    "if the off - nuclear continuum source is indeed physically related to the target and not a background quasar that happens to lie within the gbt beam , our polarized spectra give more credence to the idea that radio jets play an important role in driving hi gas outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several sources ( see appendix ) in our sample with polarized spectra have spatially resolved radio jets detected at higher frequencies .",
    "the resolutions of these vla data imply that the jets are launched within @xmath30.40.9  kpc of the core . considering a jet - induced outflow scenario for the hi absorption features",
    ", we again apply equation  5 to the blueshifted outflow components and assume @xmath48  kpc and a narrow opening angle of 5@xmath49 for the jet . under these new assumptions ,",
    "the range of mass outflow rates is 0.231  @xmath6  yr@xmath2 ( see col .",
    "( 8) of table  [ tab : outflows ] ) .",
    "we consider these values lower bounds on the actual mass outflow rates , while those derived using @xmath44 and @xmath45  kpc ( col .",
    "( 7 ) of table  [ tab : outflows ] ) are upper bounds .    under the jet scenario",
    ", the kinetic energy release rate can be calculated using the equation from @xcite : @xmath50 the kinetic energy in the outflow is on the order of @xmath51 to @xmath52 erg  s@xmath2 for our sample .",
    "the association of jets with the detected hi absorption features is also seen in the distribution of radio loudness of our sample .",
    "only one quasar in our sample is considered radio - loud based on optical - to - radio flux ratios ( see appendix ) , but optical data may be subject to contamination from the host galaxy , resulting in an underestimate of radio loudness . using the 1.4  ghz to 210  kev ratio as an indicator of radio loudness and a radio - loud cutoff value empirically derived from 1600 agn @xcite , we find that many objects in our sample are radio - loud ( table  [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "these results are consistent with those found in a recent study by @xcite that suggest higher detection rates of hi absorption toward extended compact steep - spectrum and gigahertz - peaked spectrum sources than toward the cores of radio galaxies . the environments in which the jets interact with the interstellar medium can be complex , and we may be seeing a strongly polarized continuum being absorbed selectively by multiple neutral hydrogen clouds , resulting in polarized hi absorption .",
    "the fraction of radio - loud sources with associated hi absorption ( 58% ) is far higher than the @xmath310% observed in the general population of agn . given the high star formation rates of the ulirgs , the circumnuclear starburst can contaminate the 1.4  ghz measurements . using the 1.4  ghz to sfr correlation of @xcite",
    ", we corrected the 1.4  ghz flux for star formation .",
    "of the three ulirgs with blueshifted absorption and x - ray detections , all ( 100% ) are radio - loud .",
    "similarly , of the six fir - strong quasars with detected hi outflows and x - ray emission , three ( 50% ) are considered radio - loud ; one of the two ( 50% ) fir - weak quasars with hi outflows and x - ray flux are radio - loud .",
    "this pattern recalls an idea put forward by @xcite on the formation of radio galaxies to explain why radio - quiet agn outnumber radio - loud agn .",
    "the authors suggested that major mergers , such as the progenitors of our sample of galaxies , result in coalesced supermassive black holes with high spin values due to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "substantial energy is then extracted from these fast - spinning black holes to drive jets , yielding radio - loud agn .",
    "thus , younger radio galaxies may have more powerful jets and therefore stronger jet - induced outflows .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the observations of @xcite , whose sample of young or recently restarted radio galaxies show similar hi outflows .",
    "the @xcite picture is also consistent with theoretical models of @xcite that suggest the radio loud / quiet dichotomy in agn is due to the spin of the central black hole .",
    "even though our sample with mass outflow rates is relatively small , we see some trends in our outflow measurements ( table  [ tab : outflows ] and figure  [ fig : fwzidist ] ) .",
    "however , given the small number of detected hi outflows , particularly with only two measurements for the fir - weak quasars , we can not statically confirm that the distributions we see in figure  [ fig : fwzidist ] is significant .",
    "there is also no obvious relationships between mass outflow rate and the bolometric luminosity , agn luminosity , or radio loudness for our sample .",
    "systems with deep absorption and outflows become more prevalent as we progress along the merger sequence from the newly coalesced ulirgs to the fir - strong quasars .",
    "the trend between outflow kinematics and star formation rates among the ulirgs ( figures  [ fig : fwhmvsfr ] and [ fig : fwhmvsfr_com ] ) suggests that the hi outflows in these objects are driven mainly by the starbursts , with a median mass outflow rate in the jet scenario ( @xmath39 ( jet ) @xmath31",
    "@xmath6  yr@xmath2 ) similar to their sfrs and previous na  i - based outflow measurements @xcite .",
    "ulirgs also tend to have the narrowest absorption features . in the fir - strong quasar systems ,",
    "the median mass outflow rate is @xmath39 ( jet ) @xmath35.8",
    "@xmath6  yr@xmath2 , considerably larger than their median sfr of @xmath31.0  @xmath6  yr@xmath2 . while the median mass outflow rate of the fir - weak quasars is lower , @xmath39 ( jet ) @xmath30.3",
    "@xmath6  yr@xmath2 , so is their median sfr ( @xmath30.6  @xmath6  yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , the mass - loading factor , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ratio of mass outflow rate to sfr , is much greater in the fir - strong than the value of near unity derived in ulirgs .",
    "the same value is much lower in the fir - weak quasars , but this is difficult to compare given that this is based on a single measurement .",
    "however , the distinction between the ulirgs and fir - strong quasars further supports the idea that the agn is playing a role in driving hi outflows in the quasars before the end of large - scale star formation .",
    "hi in emission is much more prevalent among the quasars than the ulirgs , and the hi emission profiles increasingly resemble those of regularly - rotating neutral gas disks as we move from fir - strong to fir - weak quasars .",
    "the amount of hi seen in emission increases modestly from @xmath34@xmath5310@xmath54  @xmath6 among the fir - strong quasars to @xmath37@xmath5310@xmath54  @xmath6 among the fir - weak quasars .",
    "these masses are consistent with those measured in low - redshift quasars @xcite and the high end of the gas mass range seen in nearby active galaxies @xcite .",
    "we may be witnessing the creation of hi disks from residual neutral gas at the centers of merger remnants .",
    "we have analyzed of gbt hi spectra of 27 ulirgs and quasars selected from the quest sample .",
    "we find that :    1 .",
    "as mergers evolve from fully coalesced ulirgs to fir - strong quasars to fir - weak quasars , the characteristics of their hi profiles also change from mostly absorption in the ulirgs to mostly emission in the fir - weak quasars , with the fir - bright quasars having intermediate properties .",
    "the kinematics of these systems change from narrow absorption features likely due to outflows driven by starbursts in ulirgs , to broad absorption features from jet - driven outflows driven by agn in fir - strong quasars , and finally to the emission profiles more characteristic of gas in rotation in fir - weak quasars . 2 .   a large fraction of the quasars exhibit polarization - dependent absorption features , with 78% of fir - strong quasars and 63% of fir - weak quasars showing these features compared with 13% in ulirgs .",
    "some of these features vary on short time scales ( down to @xmath330 minutes ) .",
    "neither time variability nor polarization - dependent spectral features are seen in contemporaneous observations of m82 ( as expected ) , reducing the likelihood that these effects are instrumental artifacts .",
    "these features are likely due to hi absorption of polarized nuclear and off - nuclear continuum emission . the large fraction ( @xmath360% ) of radio - loud sources with hi outflow - associated absorption",
    "suggests a close relationship between radio jets and the hi screen .",
    "the polarization - dependent absorption features are most likely due to the emergence of radio jets in these systems , contributing to the continuum emission against which the absorption features are detected .",
    "the @xmath360% radio - loud fraction of our sources with hi outflows is far higher than the @xmath310% seen in the general population of agn .",
    "this distinction suggests that radio jets play an important role in shaping the environments in these systems , which may tract a transition phase in the evolution of gas - rich mergers into `` mature '' radio galaxies .",
