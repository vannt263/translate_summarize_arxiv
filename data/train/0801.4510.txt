    "the harmonic oscillator is one of the most appealing models due to its well known solutions in classical mechanics and in quantum mechanics , and due to a wide variety of applications in various branches of physics  @xcite . in classical mechanics",
    "its solution is unique , and so it is in the canonical non - relativistic treatment in quantum mechanics  @xcite . in this quantum approach ,",
    "the position and momentum operators ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) satisfy the canonical commutation relation @xmath8 = - i\\hbar $ ] , and the model is described by its hamiltonian @xmath9 and the heisenberg equations .",
    "this algebraic description can be translated to a description by means of wave functions . in the position representation , for example",
    ", the operator @xmath7 corresponds to multiplying functions by the variable @xmath10 and the heisenberg operator equations correspond to schrdinger s equation , the solutions of which are expressed through hermite polynomials .",
    "these solutions or wave functions lead to important position probability functions .",
    "to study the applicability of a system modelled by a harmonic oscillator , one often turns to expressions for the joint quasi - probability function of momentum and position , i.e.  to a quantum analogue of phase space . the wigner distribution function ( d.f . )",
    "@xcite is the main theoretical tool here , as it is considered as the closest quantum analogue of a classical distribution function over the phase space .",
    "the quantum harmonic oscillator is one of the first systems for which the wigner d.f .",
    "was computed analytically . nowadays , there are also advanced experimental techniques that enable one to measure phase space densities for certain quantum systems  @xcite , and thus compare theoretical results with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "it is in this context that certain deformations or generalizations of the quantum harmonic oscillator are of relevance . in particular , deformations that are still exactly solvable and for which the wigner d.f .",
    "can be computed analytically are highly interesting .",
    "one such model is the @xmath10-deformed quantum harmonic oscillator , being exactly solvable  @xcite and having found applications in various physical models  @xcite .",
    "its wigner d.f .  has been computed in  @xcite .",
    "a deformation or generalization of the canonical quantum harmonic oscillator that is more fundamental in nature was proposed by wigner  @xcite .",
    "it is known as the one - dimensional wigner quantum oscillator or as the parabose oscillator . in wigner",
    "s approach , the canonical commutation relations are not assumed . instead of that , the compatibility of hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations is required .",
    "this approach has been the fundamental starting point of so - called wigner quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "in such an approach , one typically obtains several solutions ( several algebraic representations ) , of which only one corresponds to the canonical solution .",
    "it is thus a natural and fundamental extension of canonical quantum mechanics .",
    "it is also of growing importance as deviations from the canonical commutation relations ( in particular of commuting position operators in the context of non - commutative quantum mechanics ) are supported by investigations from several field  @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional wigner quantum oscillator itself was already solved by wigner  @xcite , leading to an oscillator energy spectrum similar to the canonical one but with shifted ground state energy equal to some arbitrary positive number @xmath11 . in a sense , this number @xmath11 can be considered as the deformation parameter , and the solutions of the wigner quantum oscillator reduce to the canonical one when @xmath12 .",
    "wigner s formulation was also the inspiration for the introduction of parabosons ( and parafermions ) , as the common boson commutator relation of the canonical case is , in wigner s approach , replaced by a triple relation that is also the defining relation of a paraboson  @xcite .",
    "later on , one realized that lie superalgebras are the natural framework for this algebraic description  @xcite , and in particular that the representations of the wigner quantum oscillator are in one - to - one correspondence with the unitary irreducible lowest weight representations of the lie superalgebra @xmath13 .",
    "so the wigner quantum oscillator , being the generalization of the canonical one , could play an important role to explain various phenomena more precisely , and its importance is undeniable .",
    "however , so far its application has been restricted in comparison with the canonical harmonic oscillator due to the fact that its behaviour in phase space has not been studied .",
    "in other words , there is no expression of the joint quasi - probability distribution function ( wigner d.f . ) of position and momentum available for the wigner quantum oscillator .",
    "the main problem is that the treatment a wigner d.f",
    ".  usually starts from the assumption that the commutator of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a constant , which is no longer the case for the non - canonical wigner quantum oscillator .",
    "it is precisely this problem which is being tackled and solved here .    in this paper",
    ", we first recall some basic facts of the one - dimensional wigner quantum oscillator or parabose oscillator .",
    "the emphasis is on the algebraic description , in terms of the lie superalgebra @xmath13 and representations characterized by a positive real number  @xmath11 ( section  2 ) . in section  3 we discuss the main definition of the wigner d.f .  in the current non - canonical setting .",
    "the main part of the paper is devoted to computing the wigner d.f.@xmath14 analytically , for the parabose oscillator in the @xmath15th excited pure state @xmath16 . for @xmath17 ( and @xmath18 ) , the calculation is somewhat simpler than in the general case , and this is treated first in section  4 .",
    "the calculation involves various computational tools . in some steps ,",
    "series are term wise integrated , so one should pay attention to convergence . here",
    ", we shall often assume that the parameter @xmath11 is of the form @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a nonnegative integer ; in that case all series appearing are finite and there are no convergence problems .",
    "the final expression of @xmath21 is essentially a series in terms of laguerre polynomials , depending only upon @xmath22 , or alternatively a confluent hypergeometric series in @xmath22 , see  .",
    "section  5 then deals with the general case : the computation of @xmath14 . here , the analysis is quite involved , and some intermediate calculations are performed in an appendix b. we obtain two alternative expressions for @xmath14 , and  , both as series of laguerre polynomials in @xmath22 .",
    "section  6 deals with some plots of the newly obtained wigner distribution functions , discusses some properties and summarizes some conclusions .    to end the introduction ,",
    "let us introduce some of the notation and classical results we are going to use .",
    "many of the formulas encountered in this article will involve binomial coefficients , factorials etc .",
    "it is therefor convenient to use the notation for ( generalized ) hypergeometric series  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be nonnegative integers , a hypergeometric series with @xmath23 numerator and @xmath24 denominator parameters is then defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the rising factorial or pochhammer symbol . when one of the numerator parameters @xmath27 is a negative integer , the series is terminating and in fact a polynomial in @xmath28 .",
    "of course , if one of the denominator parameters is also a negative integer , it has to be more negative  such that the numerator vanishes before the denominator does .",
    "all classical orthogonal polynomials can be written using this hypergeometric notation .",
    "in particular one has for the laguerre polynomials  @xcite : @xmath29 here , we also introduced an alternative notation for the confluent hypergeometric series @xmath30 . if the parameter @xmath31 is @xmath32 , we will simply write @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 . often , the @xmath33 are called laguerre polynomials , while the @xmath35 are called the generalized laguerre polynomials . for the classical orthogonality of the laguerre polynomials to hold @xmath31 needs to be bigger than @xmath36 . in particular , if @xmath31 is a negative integer , the definition   is no longer valid since one has a negative integer appearing as a denominator parameter .",
    "the laguerre polynomials can be written in an alternative way such that they are defined for all values of @xmath31 : @xmath37    many well known summation formulas can be very neatly expressed using the hypergeometric notation .",
    "most notable are the binomial summation theorem : @xmath38 with @xmath39 if @xmath11 is not a negative integer , and the chu - vandermonde summation theorem for a terminating gauss hypergeometric series : @xmath40 with @xmath15 a nonnegative integer .",
    "there exists also a very extensive theory of hypergeometric transformations , a very important transformation being kummer s transformation for confluent hypergeometric series : @xmath41",
    "in this paragraph we briefly describe the treatment of a harmonic oscillator as a wigner quantum system .",
    "although first introduced by wigner almost 60 years ago , and described in some articles and book chapters , it may still be useful to recall the main results .    consider the hamiltonian for a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( in units with mass and frequency both equal to 1 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote respectively the momentum and position operator of the system .",
    "wigner @xcite already noted that there are other solutions besides the canonical one if one only requires the compatibility between the hamilton and the heisenberg equations .",
    "thus , one drops the canonical commutation relation @xmath45 = -i$ ] ( we have taken @xmath46 ) , and instead one imposes the equivalence of hamilton s equations @xmath47 and the heisenberg equations @xmath48,\\quad   \\dot { \\hat q}= i[{\\hat h } , { \\hat q}].\\ ] ] expressing this equivalence leads to the following compatibility conditions : @xmath49 = i{\\hat q},\\quad [ { \\hat h } , { \\hat q } ] = -i{\\hat p}.\\ ] ] so , one has to find operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 , acting in some hilbert space , such that the compatibility conditions   hold , with @xmath50 given by  .",
    "also , in this hilbert space @xmath43 and @xmath44 have to be self - adjoint .",
    "the solutions to   can be found by introducing two new ( yet unknown ) operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 or equivalently @xmath54 it is then easily checked that @xmath55 and that the compatibility conditions   are equivalent with @xmath56 = \\pm 2 { \\hat b}^\\pm .",
    "\\label{ccs2}\\ ] ]    the relations   are in fact the defining relations of one pair of parabose operators @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "moreover , from the self - adjointness of the position and momentum operators it follows that @xmath58 it is known that the lie superalgebra generated by two odd elements @xmath57 subject to the restriction   is the lie superalgebra @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "so , the solutions to our problem are given by the star representations of the lie superalgebra @xmath13 .",
    "these are known , and are characterized by a positive real number @xmath11 and a vacuum vector @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 the representation space can then be shown to be the hilbert space @xmath61 with orthonormal basis vectors @xmath16 ( @xmath62 ) and with the following actions : @xmath63 from which it immediately follows that @xmath64    using the actions  , one can now compute the action of the commutator @xmath45 $ ] : @xmath65|2n\\rangle = -2ai|2n\\rangle , \\quad [ { \\hat p},{\\hat q}]|2n+1\\rangle = -2(1-a)i|2n+1\\rangle .",
    "\\label{action - comm - pq}\\ ] ] so the canonical commutation relations are only satisfied for @xmath12 and any representation with @xmath66 thus leads to a non - canonical solution .",
    "it is also important to note that for such non - canonical solutions , the commutator @xmath45 $ ] is not constant .",
    "this last fact has a serious impact on the computation of exponential operators involving linear combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 since the baker - campbell - hausdorff theorem does not give rise to a simple formula .",
    "the energy spectrum is now very easy to determine as well using   and  : @xmath67 so one has an equidistant energy spectrum with ground level given by @xmath11 .",
    "this once again confirms that only @xmath12 yields the canonical solution .",
    "also the wave functions for the parabose oscillator in the position and momentum representation are known .",
    "working in the position representation , the operator @xmath44 is still represented by multiplication by @xmath10 , the operator @xmath43 however is no longer given by its canonical realization @xmath68 , but instead has a different realization with an extra term ( depending on @xmath11 ) coming in .",
    "using this realization the time - independent schrdinger equation can then be solved yielding the following expressions for the orthonormal wave functions in terms of laguerre polynomials  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 23 ) and  @xcite : @xmath69 again , for @xmath12 , one recovers the very well known expression for the wave functions for a harmonic oscillator in terms of hermite polynomials , since there are formulas relating @xmath70 to @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "a major advantage of the phase - space formulation of quantum mechanics is the fact than one is no longer dealing with operators , but instead with constant - number equations .",
    "more in particular , the expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath73 can be calculated using the distribution function @xmath74 as follows : @xmath75 with @xmath76 the scalar function obtained by replacing the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the expression for @xmath73 by scalar variables @xmath77 and @xmath10 .",
    "herein , @xmath78 is the density operator , representing the state of the system .",
    "also , both integrations run from @xmath79 to @xmath80 ; this will be the case for all integrations in this article .",
    "it is also known that the distribution function @xmath81 depends on the so - called correspondence rule used , this is , on the way one associates a function of non - commuting operators ( thus an operator ) to a given function of scalar variables .",
    "a very popular association rule is the weyl correspondence , yielding as distribution function the so - called wigner distribution function . very often , the definition for the wigner d.f .",
    "is written as follows : @xmath82 this definition , however , is completely unsuitable for the case of non - canonical quantum mechanics , since it relies heavily on the canonical commutation relations .",
    "indeed , it was shown by tatarskii  @xcite ( see also section  2.1 of lee s review paper  @xcite ) that the wigner d.f .",
    "defined by first principles ( see equation   here ) gives rise to expression   only if @xmath43 and @xmath44 satisfy @xmath45 = -i$ ] .",
    "so if the canonical commutation relations are not satisfied , one should go back to use this first principles approach , which is described in the rest of this section .",
    "another approach is the following  @xcite : is it clear that in order to define an association rule between functions of scalar variables @xmath83 and operators @xmath84 it suffices to define this correspondence for the function @xmath85 , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 real variables .",
    "indeed , an arbitrary analytical function @xmath83 can be obtained from @xmath88 in the following way : @xmath89 note that this expression is well - defined since the partial derivate operators commute .",
    "the operator corresponding to the function @xmath83 under the chosen association rule , i.e.  for the particular choice of @xmath90 , is then given by @xmath91    once a choice for @xmath90 is made , the corresponding distribution function @xmath92 may be calculated as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the state of the system .",
    "this definition is independent of the canonical commutation relations and still allows the computation of averages by use of  .",
    "we now make the following choice for @xmath90  @xcite : @xmath95 where we have introduced the operator @xmath96 : @xmath97    since this is the only correspondence rule we are using in this article , the subscript @xmath98 will be dropped from the notation . on the other hand , as we will be concentrating on calculating explicit expressions for the distribution function @xmath99 for the pure states @xmath16 , we will introduce the subscript @xmath15 to indicate this : @xmath100    since in this article our goal will be to compute an explicit expression for  , it is convenient to recall the expression for the wigner d.f .",
    "@xmath101 in the case of canonical commutation relations : @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "so , whatever result we obtain for @xmath104 , replacing the parameter @xmath11 by @xmath105 should yield  .",
    "in this section , we compute an explicit expression for @xmath21 .",
    "this will already show the techniques involved in the computation of the wigner d.f .  for arbitrary states @xmath16 , but the resulting calculations are not quite so lengthy .",
    "to reiterate , the goal is to compute @xmath106 thus , obviously , in a first step we are going to determine the matrix elements @xmath107 , and in a second step the integration will be performed .    the operator @xmath108 being defined as @xmath109 we first try to find @xmath110 . to this end , we write @xmath111 in terms of @xmath57 : @xmath112    it is then immediately clear that @xmath113 since an odd number of applications of @xmath51 and @xmath52 on @xmath59 does not yield a term corresponding to @xmath59 in the resulting expansion , as can be seen from  . on the other hand ,",
    "using  , one finds easily that @xmath114 this suggests , as will be proved later , that one has @xmath115    using   and  , one thus finds that @xmath116 where we have used the fact that @xmath117 .",
    "this means that we now have : @xmath118    in order to compute this integral , it is useful to introduce a quadratic decaying exponential into the integrand by applying kummer s transformation   on the confluent hypergeometric series .",
    "one then has : @xmath119 where we have swapped summation and integration .",
    "we assume that the parameter @xmath11 is such that this is possible . in any case ,",
    "when the parameter @xmath11 is of the form @xmath120 this can certainly be done since one is then only dealing with finite summations . in appendix",
    "a , it is shown that @xmath121 such that @xmath122    it is important to remark that , apart from the exponential factor , the expression   is a polynomial in @xmath22 whenever the parameter @xmath11 is of the form  . in this case",
    ", it is possible to simplify the expression   even further .",
    "expand the laguerre polynomials as single sums and switch the two ( finite ) summations . on the resulting inner sum vandermonde s summation theorem   can be applied .",
    "after some further easy manipulations one then finds : @xmath123 clearly , in the canonical case ( i.e.  @xmath124 ) the resulting expression reduces correctly to @xmath125 .    to compute @xmath126",
    ", we first have to find an expression for the matrix elements @xmath127 .",
    "again , one finds the matrix elements with odd powers of @xmath96 to be zero . for the even powers",
    ", one finds using   and  : @xmath128 indicating that @xmath129 since these matrix elements are the only place where the parameter @xmath11 appears , the expression for @xmath126 is also found by replacing @xmath11 with @xmath130 in the expression for @xmath21 : @xmath131",
    "we now would like to find an explicit expression for the following integral : @xmath132 as is clear from the previous section , the key in calculating this integral is finding an expression for the matrix elements @xmath133 .",
    "as before , matrix elements with odd powers of @xmath96 are easily seen to be zero . it will also be the case that matrix elements for a state @xmath134 will be determined from those with state @xmath135 simply by replacing @xmath11 with @xmath130 .",
    "we will now give two different expressions for the matrix elements @xmath136 .",
    "we will show that they are equivalent and will compute the wigner d.f .  using each of them .",
    "the proof that the proposed expressions are in fact the correct matrix elements is relegated to an appendix , despite the importance of the result to the calculations .",
    "the proof , although in itself not difficult , requires rather lengthy calculations as one also needs the off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "basically , it involves checking that a certain expression satisfies the recurrence relation for the matrix elements ( as well as the correct boundary conditions ) .",
    "we have the following expressions for the matrix elements @xmath136 : @xmath137 or alternatively @xmath138 note that both expressions reduce to   for @xmath17 . to see that both expressions are indeed equivalent , it is easiest to write them in hypergeometric notation . for formula",
    "we have @xmath139 whilst formula   is @xmath140 so , we would like a transformation for hypergeometric series that relates a series of type @xmath141 with one of type @xmath142 . in krattenthaler s list",
    "@xcite , transformation t3231 does just that and is indeed applicable to the @xmath141-series at hand .",
    "it will turn out that we will need to apply yet another transformation , namely t4301 from the list , to the resulting series .",
    "finally , a doubling formula for rising factorials , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.25 ) , has to be applied .",
    "we thus have : @xmath143 this shows that formulas   and   are indeed equivalent .",
    "the next step is to compute expressions for @xmath144 , by using the series expansion for the operator @xmath108 .",
    "we first use  : @xmath145 this simply follows from swapping the summation order and writing the inner sum again as a hypergeometric series .",
    "the same procedure is applicable to formula  , but here one gets : @xmath146    basically , all that is left to do is to integrate these expressions against the complex exponential @xmath147 . for the expression  , we proceed as in the case of the ground state . we apply kummer s transformation   to each of the confluent hypergeometric series .",
    "one will then get a double summation over integrals of the type  .",
    "( here , we thus again assume that the order of summation and integration may be switched , which is certainly the case when the parameter @xmath11 is of the form  . )",
    "application of   for each of the integrals in the series , will yield a triple sum expression for @xmath148 , with one summation hiddenin the laguerre polynomial .",
    "explicitly , we have the following result : @xmath149    as a sanity check , we would like to see that for @xmath12 formula   reduces to @xmath150 .",
    "this means that the summation part of   should equal @xmath151 .",
    "this is not immediately clear , so we substitute @xmath12 and write the laguerre polynomial as an explicit summation and the triple sum then becomes : @xmath152 where the summation over @xmath153 is now performed first .",
    "the gauss hypergeometric series , which terminates because either @xmath154 or @xmath155 is a non positive integer , can be summed in a unified way by applying transformation  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* t2140 ) first : @xmath156 apply this summation , and one gets a double summation .",
    "the summation over the index @xmath157 can then be summed using the binomial theorem , and the result follows , showing that for @xmath12 expression   reduces correctly to the known expression  .",
    "can we also do the integration starting from  ?",
    "clearly , we need a kummer - like transformation for @xmath158-series that introduces a quadratic decaying exponential . fortunately ,",
    "such a transformation was published quite recently by paris  @xcite .",
    "his main transformation expresses one @xmath158-series as an exponential function multiplied by an infinite series containing @xmath158-series .",
    "we , however , only need a simpler version where a finite sum of @xmath158-series is involved : @xmath159    as is stands , expression   is a double sum . after applying",
    ", it will be a triple sum , and since integrating using   introduces an extra summation , the resulting expression will be a four - fold summation . since this computation is quite similar to the ones we have already done , we just state the result : @xmath160 there now exist quite a number of formulas relating sums of laguerre polynomials to another laguerre polynomial , one of them being the following  @xcite : @xmath161 this identity is also valid for @xmath162 , provided one defines the laguerre polynomials as in  .",
    "application of this identity then leads immediately to : @xmath163 also in this case , reduction to the known result for @xmath12 can be verified , and is easier than in the previous case , since the identity needed is recorded as  @xcite .",
    "we thus have found closed expressions for @xmath148 namely   and  . from this",
    "we now immediately find the corresponding expressions @xmath164 .",
    "we state the following : @xmath165 this follows immediately from the fact , shown in appendix b , that @xmath166 together with the observation that this is the only place in which the parameter @xmath11 plays a role in the computation of the wigner distribution function .",
    "parastatistics is one of the alternative approaches in particle statistics proposing that there are particles obeying statistics different from bose - einstein or fermi - dirac  @xcite .",
    "it involves an additional parameter ( often referred to as the order of statistics ) , and for one particular value of this parameter one recovers the common bose - einstein or fermi - dirac statistics . in the current case , where we just considered one parabose oscillator ,",
    "this parameter is @xmath11 , and for @xmath12 one is reduced to the canonical quantum oscillator .",
    "the simple case treated here can also be viewed as a deviation from canonical quantum mechanics .",

    "can be viewed as a quantity measuring the deviation from canonical quantum mechanics , see  .",
    "we have now obtained , for the first time , explicit expressions of the wigner d.f .  for the parabose oscillator stationary states .",
    "this allows one to consider `` phase space densities '' for a `` parastatistics quantum system '' or for a `` non - canonical quantum system '' .",

    "@xmath14 is , just as in the canonical case , a function of @xmath22 only .",
    "so the 3d - plots of @xmath14 in @xmath168-space are rotational invariant .",
    "this is why it is more convenient to give only two - dimensional plots of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath23 , where @xmath169    in figure  1 we have plotted the ground state wigner d.f .",

    "one can see that for @xmath12 ( @xmath124 , the well - known canonical case ) one finds the usual gaussian behaviour of the distribution function . as @xmath11 ( or @xmath20 ) increases , the shape changes quite significantly . for values of @xmath11",
    "larger than @xmath105 , the shape of @xmath21 is rather similar to the shape of the wigner d.f .",
    "for the first excited state of the canonical harmonic oscillator .",
    "in fact , it follows from   that @xmath21 for @xmath173 is equal to @xmath126 for @xmath12 , so in that specific case it is identical to the canonical wigner d.f.of the first excited state . as @xmath11 increases , the maximum value of @xmath21 moves further away from the origin .",
    "the ground state of the parabose oscillator behaves as the first excited state of a canonical quantum oscillator but with increasing energy as @xmath11 increases .    in figure  2",
    "we plot the distribution functions @xmath14 for a fixed @xmath11-value ( namely @xmath173 ) , and for a number of stationary states @xmath174 ) .",
    "note the separation of even and odd states near the origin .",
    "the properties of the wigner distribution functions are in agreement with the `` wave - mechanical representation '' for the parabose oscillator , as discussed in  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the approach of section  3 allowed us to define the right wigner function , satisfying all necessary properties .",

    "before , one sees that @xmath195 and hence one gets , using   and  : @xmath196 so , if we now denote @xmath192 as @xmath197 , the recurrence that @xmath197 satisfies is : @xmath198 from the fact that we are dealing with orthonormal states @xmath16 , it follows immediately that @xmath199 and also from the actions   and   it is clear that @xmath200 these two boundary conditions determine the unique solution of the recurrence  . we will now give explicit formulas that satisfy the boundary conditions   and  , and we will verify that these formulas also satisfy  . the verification of that last fact will boil down to checking that two polynomials are equal . as a polynomial basis",
    ", we will however not choose the classical basis @xmath201 , but rather we will work with the polynomials @xmath202 .",
    "we now state the formulas , @xmath203 and @xmath204 where , in both cases , @xmath205 .",
    "it is immediately clear that formulas   and   satisfy the boundary conditions   and  .",

    "since all three are very similar , we will only deal with the case @xmath210 here .",
    "we will abbreviate the summation in   as @xmath211 , then substituting the expression   in   allows simplification of the powers of @xmath212 and @xmath213 as well as the square roots , and leads to the following that needs to be checked : @xmath214 this is a polynomial identity in the variable @xmath215 .",

    "this coefficient is a rational function in the variables @xmath11 , @xmath157 , @xmath153 and @xmath207 .",
    "after clearing the denominator and simplifying the remaining rising factorials , one ends up with a polynomial of a low degree that needs to be identically zero , and that is indeed the case .",
    "so , although the checking is rather tedious , it is at the same time also simple and indeed shows that our formulas for the matrix elements are correct .",
    "we end this appendix by noting that one indeed has : @xmath219 indeed , it is easily checked that the recurrence satisfied by @xmath220 is identical to   but with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath130 .",
    "also , the boundary conditions for @xmath221 are identical to   and   and as these do not involve @xmath11 the statement is now proved .",

    "the only remaining question is thus what happens for the even states when @xmath225 in the case @xmath226 ( and @xmath66 ) .    first ,",
    "let us recall the well known fact that if one has two series of positive terms @xmath227 and @xmath228 such that @xmath229 , then convergence of @xmath228 implies that of @xmath227 .",
    "secondly , there are some well known tests for convergence of positive series , one of them is raabe s test which can be used if the ratio test fails : let @xmath227 be a series of positive terms and let : @xmath230 one then has that @xmath231 converges if @xmath232 and diverges whenever @xmath233 . when @xmath234 , the test is inconclusive .",
    "let us abbreviate @xmath22 as @xmath235 .",
    "the convergence of   then reduces to the convergence of @xmath236 next , we are going to use an inequality for the laguerre polynomials @xmath237 which gives an upper bound for @xmath238 not depending on @xmath157  @xcite ) : @xmath239 this gives us : @xmath240 the ratio test fails on the series @xmath241 , but raabe s test",
    "gives : @xmath242 so clearly , the series @xmath241 converges if @xmath222 , and hence the series   is absolutely convergent in that case .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath241 diverges for @xmath243 does not imply anything about the convergence of  .",
    "the issue about the convergence of   thus remains open for @xmath244 .",
    "when @xmath245 , however , something more can be said : @xmath246 a gauss hypergeometric series @xmath247 converges if and only if @xmath248  @xcite , which in this case amounts to @xmath222 .      for the convergence of   we follow the same strategy .",
    "first , it is clear that the convergence of @xmath249 is a sufficient condition for the convergence of   since the summation over @xmath153 is finite .",
    "then , we again use  , and in this case we get @xmath250 raabe s test yields in this case that the series @xmath241 is convergent if @xmath251 . since @xmath252 ( see the summation bounds in  ) , a sufficient ( and necessary ) condition for this to be true is @xmath222 . for @xmath245 ,",
    "use of the convergence of the gauss hypergeometric series for @xmath253 again yields convergence if and only if @xmath222 .",
