    "driven systems far from equilibrium constitute an enormous class of natural phenomena including turbulence in fluids , interface and growth problems , chemical reactions , processes in glasses and amorphous systems , biological processes , and even aspects of economical and sociological structures .    in recent years",
    "much of the focus of modern statistical physics and soft condensed matter has shifted towards such systems .",
    "drawing on the case of static and dynamic critical phenomena in and close to equilibrium , where scaling and the concept of universality have successfully served to organize our understanding and to provide a variety of calculational tools , a similar strategy has been advanced towards the much larger class of nonequilibrium phenomena with the purpose of elucidating scaling properties and more generally the morphology or pattern formation in a driven nonequilibrium state .    in this context the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation , describing the nonequilibrium growth of a noise - driven interface , provides a simple continuum model of an open driven nonlinear system exhibiting scaling and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "the kpz equation for the time evolution of the height @xmath1 has the form @xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 characterizes the damping term , @xmath4 controls the growth term , @xmath5 is a general drift term , and @xmath6 a locally correlated white gaussian noise modelling the stochastic nature of the drive or environment ; the noise correlations are characterized by the noise strength @xmath7 .    starting from a given initial interface the noise drives after a transient period the interface into a stationary fluctuating state . choosing a co - moving frame by setting @xmath8 the mean height @xmath9 decays to zero but the fluctuation spectrum about @xmath10 , characterized by the moments @xmath11 and generally by the distribution @xmath12 , assumes a nontrivial and largely unknown form . in terms of the local slope",
    "@xmath13 the kpz equation assumes the form of the burgers equation driven by conserved noise @xmath14 which within the framework of perturbative dynamic renormalization group ( drg ) theory was first studied as a model of noise - driven irrotational fluid flow @xcite .",
    "this analysis was reviewed and extended considerably in the context of the kpz equation @xcite .",
    "the drg analysis basically addresses the long time - large distance scaling properties as illustrated for example by the dynamic scaling hypothesis @xcite applied to the stationary height - height correlations @xmath15 here the roughness exponent @xmath16 , the dynamic exponent @xmath17 , and the scaling function @xmath18 together define the kpz universality class .",
    "power counting or a drg analysis identifies @xmath19 as the lower critical dimension .",
    "an @xmath20-expansion about @xmath19 yields a kinetic phase transition at a finite growth strength @xmath4 above @xmath19 from a weak coupling smooth phase with @xmath21 and @xmath22 to a strong coupling rough phase with largely unknown scaling exponents .    in @xmath23",
    "the drg analysis fortuitously yields @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this result also follows from the galilean invariance of ( [ kpz ] ) , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , which since @xmath4 is unrenormalized under the drg , implies the scaling law @xmath29 .",
    "together with the known stationary distribution , @xmath30 @xcite , of independent slope fluctuations , yielding @xmath31 , we then obtain @xmath24 .",
    "however , unlike critical phenomena , the drg analysis even carried to orders beyond first loop order @xcite fails to yield detailed insight into the scaling and pattern formation mechanism in the kpz equation .",
    "a mode coupling analysis ( mc ) of the kpz equation has also been carried out both with regard to a determination of the scaling function @xmath18 in @xmath23 and in search for an elusive upper critical dimension assumed to be at @xmath32 beyond which @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . of other approaches to the scaling properties associated with the kpz universality class we mention briefly i ) the mapping of the kpz equation to the problem of directed polymers in a quenched random environment @xcite , a problem in ill - condensed matter , ii ) exact results obtained for the @xmath23 asymmetric exclusion model @xcite which is in the same universality class as the kpz equation , and finally iii ) recent exact results for a discrete @xmath23 polynuclear growth model in the kpz universality class through the association with random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have in a plot of the renormalized coupling strength versus the dimension summarized the scaling properties of the kpz equation .    in summary ,",
    "the kpz equation as a continuum model of an intrinsic nonequilibrium problem and its relationship to problems in discrete driven lattice gases , random systems of the spin glass type , and random matrix theory , is of broad and paradigmatic interest .     versus the dimension @xmath33 of the system .",
    "below @xmath19 the scaling properties are determined by the strong coupling fixed . above @xmath19",
    "the system exhibits a kinetic phase transition from a weak coupling phase to a strong coupling phase .",
    "we have also indicated three conjectures for the exponent @xmath17 : the operator expansion conjecture @xmath34 by lssig @xcite and the conjectures based on numerics , @xmath35 by wolf and kertsz @xcite and @xmath36 by kim and kosterlitz @xcite .",

    "in recent work we have proposed yet another approach to the scaling and pattern formation of the kpz equation @xcite which we review below .",
    "the strong coupling approach is developed by focusing on the fokker - planck equation @xmath37 associated with the kpz equation ( [ kpz ] ) . here",
    "the hamiltonian or liouvillian @xmath38 drives the transition probability @xmath39 for the height profile @xmath40 at time @xmath41 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation has the form of a schrdinger equation in imaginary time for the real positive `` wave function '' @xmath42 . the noise strength @xmath7 plays the role of an effective `` planck constant '' .",
    "since the kpz equation is a stochastic field equation the associated fokker - planck equation is a vastly more complicated functional - differential equation .",

    "the deterministic `` noise field '' @xmath49 corresponds to the stochastic noise @xmath6 in ( [ kpz ] ) .",
    "the prescription for the analysis of the kpz equation is now straightforward . in order to determine the transition probability from an initial height profile @xmath50 at time @xmath51 to a final height profile @xmath40 at time",
    "@xmath41 we must evaluate the `` classical '' action associated with a `` classical '' orbit from @xmath50 to @xmath40 traversed in time @xmath41 .",
    "the strong coupling features enters in the determination of the relevant orbits which should be nonperturbative solutions of the field equations .",
    "as is well - known from the wkb approximation in quantum theory and quantum field theory , the weak noise limit has no direct bearing on the coupling strength .",
    "the action in the present nonequilibrium context plays the same role as the energy in the boltzmann factor in equilibrium .",
    "since the `` classical '' system is conserved the orbits are confined to lie on energy surfaces @xmath52 . here the zero energy surface @xmath53 plays a central role in determining the stationary distribution @xmath54 . unlike the case in mechanical systems , the zero energy surface is unbounded and has a characteristic submanifold structure reflecting the underlying stochastic nature of the kpz equation .",
    "the transient submanifold for @xmath55 corresponds to the damped noiseless kpz equation for @xmath56 , whereas the in general unknown stationary submanifolds is `` orthogonal '' to @xmath55 in the sense that the @xmath57 with @xmath58 given by ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the submanifolds intersect in the saddle point @xmath59 corresponding to ergodic behavior . at long times",
    "a specific orbit is unbounded ; however , an orbit from @xmath44 to @xmath60 in time @xmath41 is finite . at long times",
    "the orbit migrates from the finite energy surface to the zero energy submanifolds . after an initial transient period",
    "the noise drives the orbit close to the saddle point .",

    "moreover , the field equations ( [ field1 ] ) and ( [ field2 ] ) admit simple cusp solutions , in the static case of the form @xmath63 centered about @xmath64 and for large @xmath65 approaching the constant slope form @xmath66 . in terms of the local slope",
    "@xmath67 the cusps correspond to solitons or domain walls of the kink - like form @xmath68 .",
    "the right hand soliton for @xmath69 moves on the @xmath55 submanifold and is the well - known viscosity - smoothed shock wave solution of the noiseless burgers equation @xmath70 .",
    "the left hand soliton for @xmath71 moves on the @xmath72 submanifold and is a solution of the growing burgers equation @xmath73 with negative damping constant .",
    "the cusps or solitons form the elementary excitations or growth modes in a heuristic many body description of a growing interface . boosting the cusps or solitons to a finite propagation velocity @xmath74 by means of the galilean transformation above",
    "we obtain the kinematic condition @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the right and left boundary values of the solitons , respectively . matching a set of right and left hand solitons according to the kinematic condition we thus obtain a many body or multi - soliton representation of a growing interface .",
    "imposing periodic boundary conditions it is easily seen by inspection that the propagation of solitons lead to a growing interface .",
    "a particular simple growth mode corresponds to the propagation of a pair of matched right and left hand solitons .",
    "this mode is equivalent to the addition of layer upon layer in the evolution of the height profile . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have shown the single cusps and solitons and a multi soliton representation of a growing interface        the wkb approach also allows us to associate a dynamics with the propagation of growth modes . only the noise - induced left hand solitons are endowed with dynamical properties . in terms of the boundary values",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 we obtain the galilean invariant action @xmath78 , from the hamiltonian @xmath38 the energy @xmath79 , and from @xmath80 the momentum @xmath81 . considering specifically a two - soliton mode composed of a right hand and left hand soliton with amplitude @xmath82 and with vanishing boundary conditions it carries action @xmath83 , energy @xmath84 , momentum @xmath85 and propagates with velocity @xmath86 . eliminating the velocity we obtain the soliton dispersion law and from ( [ wkb ] ) the pair soliton distribution , @xmath65 denotes the center of mass coordinate , @xmath87 from these two expressions we draw two results : i ) it follows easily from the spectral properties of the height correlations that the exponent @xmath88 in the soliton pair dispersion law can be identified with the dynamic exponents @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamical scaling is thus associated with the low lying gapless soliton modes .",
    "ii ) in the stochastic growth mode characterized by a gas of independent pair solitons the solitons perform random walk with the characteristics of superdiffusion , e.g. , the distribution implies the mean square displacement @xmath89 with @xmath24 .",
    "in dimensions beyond @xmath23 the scaling and morphology are more involved . from the drg and the mapping to directed polymers if follows that @xmath19 is a lower critical dimension . above @xmath19",
    "the system undergoes a kinetic phase transition at a finite coupling from a weak coupling smooth phase with exponents @xmath21 and @xmath90 to a strong coupling rough phase .",
    "an operator expansion method yields @xmath91 for @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "two other heuristics proposals are @xmath93 @xcite and @xmath94 @xcite based on numerics ; they both yield @xmath24 in @xmath23 .",
    "common to all these expressions is that @xmath95 for @xmath96 , i.e. , yielding an infinite upper critical dimension . @xcite .    within the present",
    "wkb approach the evolution of the morphology of the growing interface is given by the appropriate strong coupling solutions of the `` classical '' equations ( [ field1 ] ) and ( [ field2 ] ) .",
    "in one dimension we were able analytically to find soliton solutions and thus `` parameterize '' a growing interface in terms of a gas of kinematically matched solitons .",
    "we have also analyzed the equations numerically in one dimension but here the negative diffusion coefficient in the equation for the noise field @xmath97 renders the coupled equations numerically unstable and we were only able to verify certain soliton collision configurations .",
    "the same instability problem will remain in higher dimension and it is at the moment not clear how to find solutions numerically .",
    "starting from random initial conditions the time evolution of the noiseless burgers equation is damped @xcite . since the nonlinear cole - hopf transformation @xcite relates the slope field to a linear diffusive field",
    "the transient morphology can be analyzed by saddle point methods and is characterized by a gas of localized right hand solitons connected by ramp solutions ; for the height field this pattern formation corresponds to a gas of downward cusps connected by parabolic segments . in two and higher dimensions one finds a corresponding morphology @xcite .",
    "the height field forms a damped cellular network of growing `` domes '' connected by `` valley s '' .",
    "the domes and valleys correspond to the parabolic segments and downward cusps in one dimension , respectively .",
    "when the noise is `` turned on '' the right hand soliton in one dimension is supplemented by a noise induced left hand soliton in the wkb interpretation and as discussed above the morphology can be discussed in terms of connected right hand and left hand solitons . for the height field one version of this morphology corresponds to growing and decaying plateaus .",
    "the moving steps connecting the plateaus correspond to soliton pairs in the slope field .",
    "similarly , we believe that a corresponding morphology takes place in higher dimensions . in for example",
    "two dimensions the stationary growth morphology in the height field is composed of growing and decaying islands forming a cellular network .",
    "the islands are connected by ramps or steps propagating with a velocity dictated by the galilean invariance of the corresponding burgers equation .",
    "the statistical weight of a morphology is then given by the action associated with a given time evolution from @xmath44 to @xmath60 in a time @xmath41 .",
    "if we parameterize the islands by linear segments and ignore vertex corrections we can make use of the one dimensional soliton solutions and connect the island by means of pair - solitons of amplitude @xmath82 .",
    "the steps will then propagate with a velocity @xmath74 or order @xmath98 and carry an action of order @xmath99 per . unit length . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have depicted a growth configuration for the height field in two dimensions .",
    "we now have enough elements of a future more detailed theory to venture a proposal for the dynamic exponent @xmath17 .",
    "first we notice that the localized growth modes lie on the stationary manifold @xmath53 . in one dimension this manifold",
    "is given by @xmath100 , yielding the action @xmath101 and the stationary distribution @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "in higher dimensions the stationary manifold is unknown and the stationary distribution is expected to be non - gaussian and skew @xcite .",
    "however , assuming that the galilee invariant action for a step in @xmath60 is a function of the slope change @xmath103 ( ignoring the vector character of @xmath104 ) and expressing @xmath105 in the form @xmath106 , where the factor @xmath107 arises from the extended character of the higher dimensional `` solitons '' or `` domain walls '' providing the growth modes , a natural choice interpolating between @xmath23 and @xmath108 is to set @xmath109 . finally , noting that @xmath110 and balancing the space and time dependencies of @xmath74 and @xmath111 we infer a dynamic exponent in agreement with wolf and kertez @xcite @xmath112 this expression agrees with @xmath24 in @xmath23 .",
    "in @xmath19 we obtain @xmath113 which is close to the numerical value @xcite . for @xmath96",
