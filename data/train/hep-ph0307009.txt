    "heavy - ion collisions at energies around 1 - 2 agev offer the possibility of studying hadrons under extreme conditions @xcite , and especially the properties of antikaons in a hot and dense medium .",
    "a considerable effort has been invested in analysing heavy - ion data implementing the modified properties of the hadrons in the medium where they are produced .",
    "in particular the multiplicity of kaons and antikaons could give information about their in - medium properties .",
    "one first observation in c@xmath4c and ni@xmath4ni collisions @xcite is that , as a function of the energy difference @xmath5-@xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the energy for the particle production ( 2.5 gev for @xmath7 via @xmath8 and 2.9 gev for @xmath1 via @xmath9 ) , the number of @xmath1 balanced the number of @xmath7 although in @xmath10 collisions the production cross - sections close to threshold are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude different .",
    "this could be interpreted as an indication of an attractive @xmath1 optical potential in the medium .",
    "it has also been observed that the @xmath0 ratio remains almost constant for c@xmath4c , ni@xmath4ni and au@xmath4au collisions for 1.5 agev @xcite .",
    "this could indicate that the absorption of @xmath1 via @xmath11 is suppressed and/or an enhanced @xmath1 production is obtained because of an attractive @xmath1 optical potential .",
    "finally , a centrality independence for the @xmath0 ratio has been noticed in au@xmath4au and pb@xmath4pb reactions at 1.5 agev @xcite .",
    "a recent interpretation claims that this centrality independence is a consequence of the strong correlation between the @xmath7 and @xmath1 yields @xcite .",
    "in fact , the centrality independence of the @xmath0 ratio has often been advocated as signalling the lack of in - medium effects in the framework of statistical models as the volume cancels out exactly in the ratio @xcite . however ,",
    "brown et al . introduced the concept of `` broad - band equilibration '' @xcite according to which the independence on centrality of the @xmath0 ratio can be explained including medium effects .",
    "this paper is devoted to study the influence of dressing the antikaons on the @xmath0 ratio with particular emphasis of bringing new insight into the role of in - medium effects in heavy - ion collisions at gsi energies .",
    "in this section we present a calculation of the @xmath0 ratio in the framework of the statistical model .",
    "the basic hypothesis is to assume thermal and chemical equilibrium @xcite in the final state of relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "one deals with an hadronic gas model which is a dilute system of hadrons that can be described by two parameters : the baryonic chemical potential @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the fact that the number of strange particles in the final state is small at gsi energies requires an exact treatment of strangeness conservation , while the baryonic and charge conservation laws can be satisfied on average .",
    "therefore , using statistical mechanics , one obtains for the @xmath0 ratio @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the one - particle partition function for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 indicate the sum of one - particle partition functions for baryons ( mesons ) with @xmath18 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath0 ratio is independent of the volume and , hence , the same in the canonical and grandcanonical scheme used for strangeness conservation in contrast to the @xmath1 and @xmath7 multiplicities alone @xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "our objective is to study how the in - medium modifications of the properties of the hadrons at finite temperature affect the value of the @xmath1/@xmath7 ratio , focusing our attention on the dressing of antikaons . for consistency with previous works ,",
    "we prefer to compute the inverse ratio @xmath7/@xmath1 @xmath19 this expression is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : largevolume ] ) but takes into account only the most relevant contributions . for balancing the number of @xmath7 , the main contribution in the @xmath20 sector comes from @xmath21 and @xmath22 hyperons and , in a smaller proportion , from @xmath1 mesons and @xmath23 resonances .",
    "the number of @xmath1 is balanced by the presence of @xmath7 mesons .",
    "then , the particles involved in the calculation should be dressed according to their properties in the hot and dense medium in which they are embedded . for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "the partition function @xmath24 is built using a mean - field dispersion relation for the single - particle energies ( @xmath25 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath26 is given in mev and @xmath27 in @xmath28 , and @xmath29 mev of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath30 ) .",
    "the resonance @xmath23 is described by a breit - wigner shape @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "finally , two different prescriptions for the single - particle energy of the antikaons have been used ( see fig.[fig : antikaon ] ) .",
    "first , we use the on - shell or mean - field approximation for the @xmath1 potential . in this approach",
    "the partition function reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath1 single - particle potential in the brueckner - hartree - fock approach @xcite ( see l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : antikaon ] ) based on the @xmath3 meson - exchange potential of the jlich group @xcite .",
    "the second approach incorporates the @xmath1 spectral density , @xmath36 using the s - wave component of the jlich interaction and adding the p - wave contributions as done in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : antikaon ] ) .",
    "this p - wave components come from the coupling of the @xmath1 meson to hyperon - hole states ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the effects of dressing the @xmath1 mesons in hot and dense matter on the @xmath0 ratio using an experimental value of 0.031 @xmath38 0.005 as reported in @xcite for ni@xmath4ni collisions at 1.93 agev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio - dens ] the inverse ratio , @xmath39 , is shown for two temperatures ( @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 mev ) using different approaches for the dressing of the @xmath1 meson : free gas ( dot - dashed lines ) , the on - shell approach ( dotted lines ) and using the @xmath1 spectral density including s - waves ( long - dashed lines ) or both s- and p - waves ( solid lines ) .",
    "we note that the ratio grows with @xmath42 as we increase the density .",
    "the curves representing the @xmath39 ratio tend to bend down after the initial increase when the in - medium @xmath1 properties are included .",
    "this effect is clearly seen when the s- and p - wave contributions of the @xmath1 spectral self - energy are taken into account in the spectral density . actually , the low energy components of the @xmath1 spectral density related to @xmath37 excitations are responsible for this behaviour ( see the overlap of the boltzmann factor with the low energy region of the @xmath1 spectral density in fig .  [",
    "fig : antikaon ] ) .",
    "a flat region as a function of the density is observed , which is in qualitative agreement with the `` broad - band equilibration '' advocated by brown et al.@xcite .",
    "however , this behaviour was found using a mean - field model , through a compensation of the increased attraction of the mean - field @xmath1 potential with the increase in the baryon chemical potential as density grows .",
    "in contrast , our mean - field approach does not achieve this `` broad - band '' behaviour .    in order to obtain the relation between the temperature and the chemical potential for a fixed value of the @xmath39 ratio , the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : t - m ] shows the values of temperature and chemical potential compatible with a value of @xmath43 for the approaches discussed above .",
    "the dot - dashed line stands for a free gas , similar to the calculations of ref.@xcite .",
    "the on - shell approach ( dotted line ) does not represent the broad - band effect , as already mentioned .",
    "but due to the enhanced attraction felt by the @xmath1 mesons for higher densities , the chemical potential @xmath12 compatible with the value of the experimental ratio measured also increases for a given temperature . when the @xmath1 spectral density containing s - wave components is used ( dashed line ) , two possible solutions that are compatible with the ratio emerge",
    ". finally , a band of chemical potentials @xmath12 up to 850 mev at a temperature of @xmath44 mev appears , when both , s- and p - wave contributions are considered ( solid line ) .",
    "however , in the latter case , the temperature is too low to be compatible with the measured slope parameter of the pion spectra and the corresponding freeze - out densities are too small ( up to @xmath45 only ) , so we can hardly speak of a `` broad band '' feature in the sense of that of brown et al . in the r.h.s .  of fig .",
    "[ fig : t - m ] we represent the temperature and chemical potential for different values of the ratio when the full @xmath1 spectral density is used .",
    "one observes that the ratio should be of the order of @xmath46 to obtain the more plausible temperature of @xmath47 mev .",
    "we note that this reduced ratio translates into an overall enhanced production of @xmath1 by a factor of 2 compared to the experimental value .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the additional strength of the @xmath1 spectral density at low energies .",
    "the influence of a hot and dense medium on the properties of the hadrons involved in the determination of the @xmath1/@xmath7 ratio has been studied , paying special attention to the properties of antikaons .",
    "the temperature and chemical potential compatible with a given ratio depend very strongly on the approach used for the in - medium property of the @xmath1(@xmath44 mev and @xmath12 up to @xmath48 mev for @xmath7/@xmath49 with the full @xmath1 spectral density ) .",
    "the `` broad - band equilibration '' advocated by brown , rho and song is not achieved in the on - shell approach .",
    "this behaviour is only observed when @xmath1 is described by the full spectral density due to the coupling of the @xmath1 meson to @xmath37 states .",
    "however , the @xmath0 ratio is in excess by a factor of 2 with respect to the experimental one .",
    "dynamical non - equilibrium effects could explain the number of on - shell @xmath1 at freeze - out .",
