    "superconducting quantum metamaterials ( sqms ) are novel artificially prepared solid state structures whose electrodynamic properties are governed by peculiar interplay of classical maxwell electrodynamics and quantum - mechanical laws @xcite .",
    "most of sqms consists of an array of interacting superconducting qubits ( two - level systems ) , e.g. charge qubits @xcite , flux qubits @xcite , transmons @xcite etc .",
    "numerous experiments on the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the sqm @xcite have allowed one to observe an excitation of coherent quantum - mechanical oscillations ( beatings ) between two states of single qubits .",

    "a small width of such drops is determined by various dissipative and decoherent processes",
    ".    however , in imperfect sqms an unavoidable disorder in superconducting qubits parameters is always present , and it results in a substantial spread of energy level differences @xmath8 . in this case",
    "it is plausible to suppose that the _ individual _ coherent quantum - mechanical oscillations of single qubits occur in the sqm , and the @xmath0 has to display a large amount of small resonant drops up to the value @xmath9 , where @xmath9 is a number of qubits in the sqm @xcite .",

    "surprisingly in other experiments carried out on diverse sqms a small number ( one or two ) of giant resonant drops has been observed in spite of the presence of large number of qubits with different parameters @xcite .",
    "however , the physical conditions necessitating to observe such _ collective ( synchronized ) quantum - mechanical behavior _ are not clear at this moment .    a key point allowing one to resolve such a puzzle is _ electromagnetic interactions _ between qubits .",
    "two types of interactions can be realized in the sqms : the nearest - neighbor interaction that is due to direct inductive or capacitive electromagnetic interaction between adjacent qubits , and/or the long - range electromagnetic interaction arising due to consequent emission , propagation and absorbtion of virtual photons in low - dissipative resonator @xcite .    in this article taking into account the inductive interaction between adjacent qubits",
    "we show that the interaction between qubits can overcome the disorder and establish collective synchronized quantum - mechanical oscillations characterized by just few frequencies .",
    "we obtain that even in the case of a weak interaction , i.e. @xmath11 ( @xmath3 is the typical energy of nearest - neighbor interactions ) , a large amount of qubits @xmath12 are synchronized , and these qubits display collective quantum - mechanical oscillations of a single frequency .",

    "the intrinsic correlations of frequencies , and , in particular , the dependencies of the correlation radius @xmath1 on the strength of interaction @xmath69 and the disorder @xmath4 strongly resemble the phenomenon of anderson localization in disordered low - dimensional solid state systems @xcite .",
    "the origin of such similarity is the following : the disordered sqms with nearest - neighbor interactions are mapped exactly on the quantum izing model with a large transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a model is written as @xmath70    in the limit of @xmath71 the ground state of this model is the spin ordering in the @xmath46 direction , and the low - lying excited states form the _ spinon band . _",
    "separated from the ground state by the energy gap of order @xmath7 . in the presence of disorder",
    "all spinon states are localized , and a spread of localized wave function of spinons is of order @xmath1 .",
    "such anderson localization in the spinon band is shown schematically in fig 3 .",
    "therefore , the coherent quantum mechanical oscillations correspond to the resonant transitions between the ground state and the various excited states of localized spinons .          the coherent quantum - mechanical oscillations excited in the sqm can be observed through the frequency dependent transmission coefficient @xmath0 of electromagnetic waves propagating in the transmission line inductively coupled to the sqm @xcite . the @xmath0",
    "is determined by time - dependent quantum - mechanical correlation functions of qubits @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the correlation function @xmath73 displays oscillations of frequency @xmath74 , and taking into account the finite dissipation @xmath75 one can write down a generic expression for the transmission coefficient @xmath0 as a set of resonant drops @xmath76 where the parameter @xmath77 characterizes the coupling between the transmission line and sqm .",
    "thus , as the electromagnetic interaction between adjacent qubits are small , i.e. @xmath78 , and a substantial spread of qubit splitting @xmath79 , the disordered sqm supports @xmath9 non - synchronized coherent quantum oscillations of different frequencies .",
    "these non - synchronized coherent quantum - mechanical oscillations manifest themselves by @xmath9 small resonant drops in the @xmath0 ( see , eq .",
    "( [ transmission coefficients ] ) ) .",
    "however , the crossover to partially synchronized regime occurs as the inductive interaction between nearest - neighbors qubits overcomes the disorder in qubits energy level differences , i.e. @xmath80 . in this regime",
    "the correlation radius @xmath1 exceeds the distance @xmath5 between qubits , and a large amount of qubits , @xmath81 displays collective synchronized behavior characterized by a single frequency .",
    "as the interaction @xmath3 goes over the value @xmath82 all qubits become synchronized , and the collective quantum mechanical oscillations are established in a whole sqm .",
    "notice here , that main assumption of our analysis is the absence of correlations of instanton ( anti - instanton ) positions on the @xmath22-axis , and this assumption is valid as @xmath83 .",
    "the fingerprints of synchronized regimes of coherent quantum oscillations are a few number of giant resonant drops in the frequency dependent electromagnetic waves transmission , @xmath0 ( see fig . 1 , and eq . ( [ transmission coefficients ] ) ) . in the synchronized quantum - mechanical dynamic state",
    "a number of such resonant drops is @xmath84 ^ 2 $ ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the sqm containing of 20 qubits has been experimentally studied . in these experiments one or two giant resonant drops in the frequency dependent transmission coefficient , @xmath0 ,",
    "have been observed .",
    "these results indicate the excitation of synchronized coherent quantum mechanical oscillations in the sqm , and we argue that this novel state occurs due to the presence of substantial inductive coupling between adjacent qubits , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "however , one can not exclude an alternative explanation that a long - range interaction in an array of qubits also can induce the synchronized quantum - mechanical dynamic state .",
    "such an interaction originates from the emission ( absorption ) of virtual photons of a low - dissipative resonator @xcite .",
    "this type of interaction leads to the interaction between instantons ( anti - instantons ) of different qubits , and it also allows to equalize quantities of instantons ( anti - instantons ) on different qubits , and therefore , to establish a synchronized regime .",
    "we will address the quantitative analysis of synchronized quantum - mechanical oscillations induced by long - range interaction , elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion we have theoretically analyzed the excitation of coherent quantum - mechanical oscillations in disordered sqms .",
    "our analysis is based on the mapping of coherent quantum - mechanical oscillations to series of alternating instanton ( anti - instanton ) solutions in the path - integral approach . in this model",
    "the frequencies of quantum - mechanical oscillations are directly related to the quantity of instantons on different qubits , @xmath29 .",
    "the disorder results in a spread of @xmath29 along the array of qubits , and a weak electromagnetic interaction between adjacent qubits , @xmath3 , leads to the partial alignment of these quantities , @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we have obtained that a large amount of qubits can display synchronized collective behavior characterized by a single frequency .",
    "the size of the region showing synchronized behavior is determined by the ratio of the strength of interaction @xmath3 to the typical spread of energy splitting of qubits , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the fabrication of disordered sqms with a tunable inductive coupling allows one to observe the crossover from a non - synchronized regime to the synchronized regime , and provides the direct evidence of synchronized quantum - mechanical oscillations .",
    "we anticipate that the realization of synchronized regime in intrinsically disordered sqms will result in a substantial simplification of the process of qubits addressing .",
    "finally , since arrays of interacting qubits are exactly mapped on various quantum spin models , our method of instanton analysis can be used for a quantitative theoretical study of low - lying quantum - mechanical states in diverse interacting disordered quantum systems under equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
