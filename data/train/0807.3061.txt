    "the charmless hadronic b decays are important in determining the ckm phase angle and searching for new physics signal in b physics .",
    "the theory of hadronic b decays involving non - perturbative dynamics is improving fast since the so called naive factorization approach @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "the qcd factorization approach ( qcdf ) @xcite and perturbative qcd factorization ( pqcd ) approach @xcite together with the soft - collinear effective theory @xcite solved a lot of problems in the non - leptonic b meson decays .",
    "although most of the branching ratios measured by the b factory experiments can be explained by any of the theories , the direct cp asymmetries measured by the experiments are ever predicted with the right sign only by the pqcd approach @xcite .",
    "the lhcb experiment will soon run in the end of 2008 . with a very large luminosity",
    ", it will accumulate a lot of b and @xmath3 events .",
    "the progress in both theory and experiment encourages us to apply the pqcd approach to the charmless @xmath3 decays @xcite .",
    "in the hadronic @xmath4 decays , there are various energy scales involved .",
    "the factorization theorem allows us to calculate them separately .",
    "first , the physics from the electroweak scale down to b quark mass scale is described by the renormalization group running of the wilson coefficients of effective four quark operators .",
    "secondly , the hard scale from b quark mass scale to the factorization scale @xmath5 are calculated by the hard part calculation in the perturbative qcd approach @xcite .",
    "when doing the integration of the momentum fraction @xmath6 of the light quark , end point singularity will appear in the collinear factorization ( qcdf and scet ) which breaks down the factorization theorem . in the pqcd approach , we do not neglect the transverse momentum @xmath7 of the light quarks in meson",
    ". therefore the endpoint singularity disappears",
    ". the inclusion of transverse momentum will also give large double logarithms ln@xmath8 and ln@xmath9 in the hard part calculations .",
    "using the renormalization group equation , we can resum them for all loops to the leading order resulting sudakov factors .",
    "the sudakov factors suppress the endpoint contributions to make the pqcd calculation consistent@xcite .",
    "the physics below the factorization scale is non - perturbative in nature , which is described by the hadronic wave functions of mesons .",
    "they are not perturbatively calculable , but universal for all the decay processes .",
    "since many of the hadronic and semi - leptonic @xmath10 decays have been measured well in the two b factory experiments , the light wave functions are strictly constrained .",
    "therefore , it is useful to use the same light meson wave functions in our @xmath3 decays determined from the hadronic @xmath10 decays .",
    "the uncertainty of the hadronic wave functions will come mainly from the su(3 ) breaking effect between the @xmath3 wave function and @xmath10 wave function @xcite . in recent years , a lot of studies have been performed for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays in the pqcd approach @xcite . the parameter @xmath13 has been fixed there using the rich experimental data on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons . in the su(3 ) limit , this parameter should be the same in @xmath3 decays .",
    "considering a small su(3 ) breaking , the @xmath14 quark momentum fraction here should be a little larger than that of the @xmath15 or @xmath16 quark in the @xmath10 mesons , since the @xmath14 quark is heavier than the @xmath15 or @xmath16 quark .",
    "the shape of the distribution amplitude is shown in fig.[bswave ] for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to see that the larger @xmath20 gives a larger momentum fraction to the @xmath14 quark .",
    "we will use @xmath21 in this paper for the @xmath3 decays , which characterize the fact that the @xmath14 quark in @xmath3 meson carries a littler larger momentum fraction than the @xmath16 quark in the @xmath22 meson .",
    "meson distribution amplitudes .",
    "the solid- , dashed- , and tiny - dashed- lines correspond to @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "for @xmath10(@xmath3 ) meson decays with two light mesons in the final states , the light mesons obtain large momentum of 2.6gev in the @xmath10(@xmath3 ) meson rest frame .",
    "all the quarks inside the light mesons are therefore energetic and collinear like .",
    "since the heavy b quark in @xmath10(@xmath3 ) meson carries most of the energy of @xmath10(@xmath3 ) meson , the light quark in @xmath10(@xmath3 ) meson is soft . in the usual emission diagram of @xmath10(@xmath3 ) decays , this quark goes to the final state meson without electroweak interaction with other quarks , which is called a spectator quark .",
    "therefore there must be a connecting hard gluon to make it from soft like to collinear like .",
    "the hard part of the interaction becomes six quark operator rather than four .",
    "the soft dynamics here is included in the meson wave functions .",
    "the decay amplitude is infrared safe and can be factorized as the following formalism : @xmath23 , \\label{eq : factorization_formula}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are the corresponding wilson coefficients of four quark operators ; @xmath25 are the meson wave functions and the factorization scale @xmath26 denotes the largest energy scale of hard process @xmath27 , which is the typical energy scale in pqcd approach .",
    "the exponential of @xmath28 function is the so - called sudakov form factor resulting from the resummation of double logarithms occurred in the qcd loop corrections , which can suppress the contribution from the non - perturbative region .",
    "first we give the numerical results in the pqcd approach for the form factors at maximal recoil .",
    "for the @xmath29 form factors , we obtain : @xmath30 for the @xmath31 form factors , we obtain : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( for the @xmath12 and @xmath11 mesons ) and @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 gev ( for the @xmath37 meson ) .",
    "they quantify the su(3)-symmetry breaking effects in the form factors in the pqcd approach . from these form factors in eq.([form1],[form2 ] ) , one can notice that the @xmath38 transition form factors are larger than that of @xmath39 due to the su(3 ) breaking effect .",
    "usually the same kind of su(3 ) breaking effect is also expected between the @xmath39 and @xmath40 transition form factors , but the numbers shown in eq.([form1],[form2 ] ) are quite similar .",
    "this is due to the fact that the effect of a larger @xmath41 decay constant canceled by a larger @xmath42 parameter of the @xmath3 wave function .",
    "the numerical results of the @xmath4 decays branching ratios and cp asymmetry parameters are displayed in ref .",
    "most of the @xmath10 decay channels are measured by b factories ; while for charmless @xmath3 decays , only several are measured by the cdf collaboration@xcite .",
    "the measured branching ratios of @xmath10 and @xmath3 decays are consistent with the theoretical calculations .",
    "the calculated branching ratios from the three kinds of methods overlap with each other , considering the still large theoretical and experimental uncertainties .    in table  [",
    "tab : exp ] , the only measured cp asymmetry in @xmath43 decay prefer our pqcd approach rather than qcdf approach .",
    "this is similar with the situation in @xmath10 decays .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry is proportional to the sine of the strong phase difference of two decay topologies @xcite .",
    "the strong phase in our pqcd approach is mainly from the chirally enhanced space - like penguin diagram ( annihilation penguin ) ; while in the qcdf approach , the strong phase mainly comes from the virtual charm quark loop diagrams .",
    "the different origin of strong phases gives different sign to the direct cp asymmetry imply a fact that the dominant strong phase in the charmless decays should come from the annihilation diagrams .",
    "it should be noted that the scet approach can not predict the direct cp asymmetry of @xmath10 decays directly , since they need more experimental measurements as input .",
    "however , it also gives the right cp asymmetry for @xmath3 decay if with the input of experimental cp asymmetries of @xmath10 decays , which means good su(3 ) symmetry here @xcite .",
    "unlike pqcd approach and qcdf approach , in scet , the main strong phase responsible for the direct cp asymmetry is from the non - perturbative charming penguins .",
    "although it has the same topology as the annihilation penguin , it may give different mixing induced cp asymmetry for neutral @xmath4 decays @xcite .",
    ".the branching ratios ( @xmath44 ) and cp asymmetry ( % ) calculated in pqcd approach , qcdf and scet approaches together with experimental data.[tab : exp ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the su(3 ) breaking effect comes mainly from the @xmath45 meson decay constant and distribution amplitude parameter , light meson decay constant and wave function difference , and various decay topology differences .",
    "as an example we mainly focus on the decays @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as they can be related by su(3)-symmetry .",
    "a question of considerable interest is the amount of su(3)-breaking in various topologies ( diagrams ) contributing to these decays .",
    "for this purpose , we present in table  [ amplitudes ] the magnitude of the decay amplitudes ( squared , in units of gev@xmath50 ) involving the distinct topologies for the four decays modes .",
    "the first two decays in this table are related by u - spin symmetry @xmath51 ( likewise the two decays in the lower half ) .",
    "we note that the assumption of u - spin symmetry for the ( dominant ) tree ( @xmath52 ) and penguin ( @xmath53 ) amplitudes in the emission diagrams is quite good , it is less so in the other topologies , including the contributions from the @xmath54-exchange diagrams , denoted by @xmath55 for which there are non - zero contributions for the flavor - diagonal states @xmath56 and @xmath57 only .",
    "the u - spin breaking is large in the electroweak penguin induced amplitudes @xmath58 , and in the penguin annihilation amplitudes @xmath59 relating the decays @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the sm , however , the amplitudes @xmath58 are negligibly small .    in @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "the branching ratios are very different from each other due to the differing strong and weak phases entering in the tree and penguin amplitudes . however , as shown by he and gronau  @xcite , the two relevant products of the ckm matrix elements entering in the expressions for the direct cp asymmetries in these decays are equal , and , as stressed by lipkin  @xcite subsequently , the final states in these decays are charge conjugates , and the strong interactions being charge - conjugation invariant , the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath64 can be related to the well - measured cp asymmetry in the decay @xmath65 using u - spin symmetry .",
    "@xmath66 vs @xmath67 : the red ( smaller ) rectangle is the pqcd estimates worked out in this paper . the experimental results with their @xmath68 errors are shown as the larger rectangle.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    following the suggestions in the literature , we can define the following two parameters : @xmath69 the standard model predicts @xmath70 and @xmath71 if we assume @xmath72-spin symmetry . since we have a detailed dynamical theory to study the su(3 ) ( and u - spin ) symmetry violation , we can check in pqcd approach how good quantitatively this symmetry is in the ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we get @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we find that these quantities are quite reliably calculable , as anticipated on theoretical grounds .",
    "su(3 ) breaking and theoretical uncertainties are very small here , because most of the breaking effects and uncertainties are canceled due to the definition of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . on the experimental side ,",
    "the results for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are :  @xcite @xmath75 we conclude that sm is in good agreement with the data , as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ r3 ] where we plot theoretical predictions for @xmath66 vs.  @xmath67 and compare them with the current measurements of the same .",
    "the measurements of these quantities are rather imprecise at present , a situation which we hope will greatly improve at the lhcb experiment .",
    "based on the @xmath7 factorization , pqcd approach is infrared safe .",
    "its predictions on the branching ratios and cp asymmetries of the @xmath76 decays are tested well by the b factory experiments . using those tested parameters from these decays",
    ", we predict branching ratios and cp asymmetries of a number of charmless decay channels @xmath77 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the perturbative qcd approach .",
    "the experimental measurements of the three @xmath3 decay channels are consistent with our numerical results .",
    "especially the measured direct cp asymmetry of @xmath78 agree with our calculations .",
    "we also discuss the su(3 ) breaking effect in these decays , which is at least around 20 - 30% .",
    "we also show that the he - gronau - lipkin sum rule works quite well in the standard model , where the su(3 ) breaking effects mainly cancel .",
    "the annihilation penguin diagram is chirally enhanced in the pqcd approach .",
    "its large contribution and strong phase give the right sign for direct cp asymmetry , the large branching ratios for the @xmath79 decays and large transverse polarization fraction for the @xmath80 decays .",
