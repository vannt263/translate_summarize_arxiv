    "whereas the frii morphology was reproduced by pioneering hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , the apparent instabilities of fri jets and their observed deceleration are much more difficult to explain . some of the possibilities include kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities in the shear layers ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter ; ; @xcite ; ) , and mass entrainment from stellar winds @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are natural candidates to launch relativistic jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "inferred to be dynamically - important in the central regions of many radio - loud agn @xcite , they may affect jet morphology by suppressing kh mixing and initiating current - driven instabilities , e.g. , the 3d magnetic kink ( `` corkscrew '' ) instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite , hereafter ) .",
    "this motivates a detailed 3d study of magnetic effects on the global dynamics of jet - ism / igm interaction .",

    "all 4 elements are crucial for capturing the global 3d magnetic kink instability that shapes relativistic jet feedback and interaction with the ism / igm .",

    "however , this would imply that all our jets beyond the recollimation point should be globally unstable , contrary to our findings .",
    "the difference is due to adopting periodic boundary conditions , which implied that their jets were infinitely long ( @xmath68 ) and caused all their causally - connected jets to disrupt . constructed a 2d self - similar model of nonrelativistic hydrodynamic jets .",

    "that these predicted scalings are so insensitive to the underlying physical assumptions , highlights the need for first - principles , global relativistic 3d mhd simulations to constrain the basic jet physics .    here , we set the confining medium at the bondi radius and neglected other jet confining effects at smaller radii , e.g.  by disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we plan to include disk wind effects which may lead to higher values of the lorentz factor and affect the jet stability , morphology , and emission .",
    "we will also explore different density profiles , shapes of gravitational wells , and values of cluster rotation , to identify the physical processes in sources producing mpc - scale fri jets , e.g. , 3c 31 @xcite .",
    "we neglected gravity , buoyancy effects , and the thermal pressure of the pristine ism / igm .",
    "the inclusion of the latter will only have a small effect on frii jets , but it can increase the confining pressure of fri jets and decrease their stability , strengthening our results . over the simulated long time scale of @xmath69",
    "myr the effects of buoyancy may eventually become important and can expel some of the jet - inflated cavities in the form of buoyant mushroom - like bubbles , such as those seen in the 90 cm radio image of the m87 galaxy @xmath70  kpc eastward of the core @xcite .",
