    "feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is now widely believed to play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies , and to be responsible for many observational results including the @xmath4 relation and the suppression of star formation in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; king 2003 ; sanonov et al .",
    "2005 ; murray et al . 2005 ; di matteo et al . 2005 ; croton et al . 2006 ; ciotti & ostriker 2001 , 2007 ) . while significant progresses have been made , many details of the feedback are still uncertain ( ostriker et al .",
    "one approach to improve this situation is to look for more direct observational evidence for feedback and investigate them carefully .",
    "feedback often causes intermittent activities of agns , thus it should be helpful to look for observational evidence for such an intermittency ( see review by czerny et al .",
    "one evidence is the central dominant galaxies in galaxy clusters observed by _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and _ xmm / newton_. x - ray images show cavities and ripples that gives the evidence for repetitive outbursts .",
    "another example , which we will focus on in this paper , is radio galaxies .",
    "many case studies of radio structure directly show evidence for two or more of active periods .",
    "some sources are very compact , only a few kpc in size , which indicates that they are very young .",
    "these small radio sources are found to constitute 10%-30% of all sources in a flux - limited sample .",
    "odea & baum ( 1997 ; see also snellen et al .",
    "2000 ) have studied the statistical properties of a combined sample of gigahertz - peaked spectrum sources ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum radio sources ( css ) .",
    "their results show the existence of far too many compact ( young ) sources in comparison with the number of galaxies with extended old radio structures . if the total activity period lasts for @xmath5 yr , the number of sources with the ages below @xmath6 yr should be roughly @xmath7 times lower than the number of sources older than @xmath6 year , which is however not the case .",
    "the most likely explanation for the overabundance is that the activity is intermittent , i.e. , the sources undergo an active or outburst phase lasting for @xmath8 yr which recurs every @xmath7 yr ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ; kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ; kunert - bajraszewska et al .",
    "detection of several candidates for dying compact sources supports this view ( giroletti et al .",
    "2005 ; parma et al .",
    "2007 ) .    to explain the origin of such intermittent activity , czerny et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have compiled a sample consisting of 72 gps with measured age .",
    "the age is determined based on their measured hot - spot separation speed ( kinematic age ) or on the synchrotron cooling time .",
    "the majority of the age values are within the range of 200 yr and @xmath8 yr .",
    "the monochromatic luminosity @xmath9 ( @xmath10 at 5ghz ) are all available for these sources , with typical values of @xmath11-@xmath12 and average value of @xmath13 .",
    "this value can be used to estimate their bolometric luminosities of the accretion flows , @xmath14 , in the following way ( czerny et al . 2009 ) .",
    "for some sources , the 2 - 10 kev luminosity @xmath15 are available . it is found that @xmath16 is comparable to or a factor of @xmath17 higher than , @xmath18 ( vink et al .",
    "2006 ; siemiginowska et al .",
    "2008 ) . to estimate @xmath19 from @xmath15 we have to assume some template of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the sources , either luminous agns or low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , because their seds are characteristically different ( ho 1999 ) . assuming the seds of these gps sources are similar to those of luminous agns , @xmath14 is at least 10 times higher than @xmath15 ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) . assuming a fiducial number of 50 , we have @xmath20 with averaged value of @xmath21 . for several sources whose black hole masses are measured , @xmath22 with typical value of @xmath23 ( czerny et al .",
    ". however , as we will argue below , these sources are more likely low - luminosity agns whose seds are distinctively different from luminous agns , characterized mainly by the lack of big - blue - bumps ( ho 1999 ; 2008 ) . in this case , @xmath24 ( ho 1999 ) , so we have @xmath25 .",
    "the typical eddington ratio is then @xmath26 .",
    "another statistical result from the sample in czerny et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is that the more luminous the sources are , the younger they are .",
    "the only model proposed so far to explain the intermittent activity of these compact radio sources is the thermal instability of a radiation - pressure - dominated standard thin disk ( czerny et al .",
    "2009 ; see also janiuk & czerny 2011 ) . in  2 , we discuss several problems of this interpretation .",
    "we then propose in  3 an alternative model , i.e. , a ",
    "global compton scattering feedback \" model , based on yuan , xie & ostriker ( 2009 ) .",
    "we assume that these radio sources are powered by hot accretion flows ( advection - dominated accretion flow ; adaf ) rather than the standard thin disk .",
    "the compton heating to the electrons at @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the schwarzschild radius of the black hole with @xmath29 being the black hole mass ) by the radiation coming from the innermost region of the adaf will cause an oscillation of the black hole activity when @xmath30 . we calculate the durations of the active ( or outburst ) and inactive ( or quiescent ) phases and find that they are consistent with the observations .",
    "the last section (  4 ) is devoted to discussions .",
    "czerny et al . ( 2009 ) assume that the accretion flow in these radio sources is described by the standard thin disk .",
    "we usually believe that this type of disk suffers from the thermal instability when the accretion rate is above a threshold , which corresponds to @xmath31 for supermassive black holes ( it is @xmath32 for stellar - mass black holes)(e.g . , svensson & zdziarski 1994 ; janiuk , czerny & siemiginowska 2002 ) .",
    "this threshold is close to that of the global compton scattering instability by coincidence .",
    "assuming the seds of these radio sources are similar to those of luminous agns ( refer to  1 ) , they estimated their luminosities and found that all the sources in their sample are above this threshold so they concluded that they are thermally unstable .",
    "as a result of the instability , their accretion rates undergo high and low values periodically .",
    "they further assume this results in the high and low energy output of the jets . by adjusting parameters",
    ", this model can explain the timescales of both the active and inactive phases quite well .",
    "however , there are several questions about this model .",
    "the first one is whether jets can be formed from standard thin disks . to answer this question ,",
    "let s look at the observations of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) .",
    "it is believed that the physics of bhxbs and agns is the same , while the observational data in bhxbs is much better than the case of agns in terms of formation of jets from different accretion modes .",
    "an individual bhxb usually has five states , namely quiescent , low / hard , intermediate , high / soft , and very high ( also called steep power - law ) states .",
    "they are characterized by different spectra and timing features ( see a review by mccintock & remmilard 2006 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the features of the soft state are similar to those of the luminous agns while the hard state is similar to llagns .",
    "different states are believed to be caused by different accretion modes .",
    "specifically , the accretion flow in the soft state is believed to be described by the standard thin disk ; while that in the hard state by the hot accretion flow such as an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; for reviews on adafs see narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 and narayan & mcclintock 2008 ) or luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf ; yuan 2001 ; yuan & zdziarski 2004 ) . for reviews on the models of bhxbs and llagns ,",
    "readers are referred to zdziarski & gierlinski ( 2004 ) , done , gierlinski & kubota ( 2007 ) , narayan ( 2005 ) , and yuan ( 2007 ) . back to our question of jet formation ,",
    "radio observations to bhxbs clearly show that jets exists in the hard state , evidenced by the flat radio spectrum and the elongated radio image ; while both features disappear in the soft state ( fender 2006 ) .",
    "this strongly indicates that jets ca nt be formed in the standard thin disk , but can in the hot accretion flows .",
    "theoretical studies are consistent with this observational result ( e.g. , livio , ogilvie & pringle 1999 ; meier 2001 ) .",
    "observations find that the highest luminosity that hard states can reach is @xmath33 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with predictions of hot accretion flows ( yuan & zdziarski 2004 ; yuan et al .",
    "2007 ) . above this luminosity ,",
    "the cooling in the hot accretion flow becomes so strong that the accretion flow ca nt remain hot and it collapses . on the other hand ,",
    "strong radio emission has also been detected when bhxbs are more luminous , i.e , in the very high state .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 and radio loud quasars may correspond to this `` radio loud very high state '' . but this does not imply that jets can also be formed in standard thin disks because the very high state ca nt be described by a standard thin disk . actually , the accretion disk model of the very high state is still an unsolved problem . more importantly ,",
    "detailed observations indicate that the strong radio emission comes from radio - emitting blobs ejected during the transition from a `` hard very high state '' to a `` soft very high state '' , which may be modeled by a hot accretion flow - like and thin disk - like models , respectively ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .",
    "such kind of ejection is called `` episodic jets '' , to discriminate their many different features compared to the `` continuous jets '' ( see reviews in fender & belloni 2004 ; fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) propose a magnetohydrodynamical model for the formation of episodic jets , by analogy with the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) phenomenon in the sun .",
    "different from the `` continuous jets '' which are formed in the presence of large - scale open magnetic fields , episodic jets are formed in the region of closed magnetic fields in the disk corona . according to this model",
    ", episodic jets can be formed in hot accretion flows and during their collapse into a cold thin disk .",
    "so both direct observations and the theoretical model indicate that episodic jets are not formed in standard thin disks .",
    "a question is then whether the compact radio sources correspond to the hard state or very high state .",
    "the model proposed in reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) requires that the duration of the jet launching in the active phase must be @xmath34 yr .",
    "if the compact radio sources correspond to the very high state , this duration should be the timescale of the state transition .",
    "unfortunately , the details of the state transition are still an open question , although it is believed to be associated with the collapse of the hot accretion flow to a cold disk .",
    "the observed timescale of the state transition ranges from a few days to @xmath35 100 days ( yu & yan 2009 ; zdziarski & gierlinski 2004 ) .",
    "scaling this timescale with black hole mass by a factor of @xmath36 gives @xmath37 yr , which is one or two orders of magnitude longer than that required by reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) .",
    "another point against the analogy between the compact radio sources and the very high state is the luminosity . as we state in  1",
    ", the typical luminosity of these radio sources is @xmath38 .",
    "but on the other hand , the typical transition luminosity from hard to soft is significantly higher , among the range of @xmath39 .",
    "so it seems more likely that these compact radio sources correspond to the hard state rather than the very high state .",
    "but we would like to point out that it is hard at present to completely rule out the latter possibility .",
    "the second question is on the thermal instability of radiation dominated thin disk . as we mentioned at the beginning of this section , when the accretion rate is higher than a threshold so that the pressure in the accretion flow is dominated by the radiation pressure , the standard thin disk",
    "was thought to be thermally unstable ( shakura & sunyaev 1976 ; piran 1978 ) .",
    "time - dependent global hydrodynamical calculations ( e.g. , honma et al .",
    "1992 ; janiuk et al .",
    "2002 ; li et al .",
    "2007 ) found that the local thermal instability will result in the `` limit - cycle '' behavior .",
    "however , gierlinsk & done ( 2004 ) show that observations of the soft state of bhxbs , which has widely been believed to be described by the standard thin disk model , challenge the above prediction .",
    "the luminosity of the high state sources compiled in their sample spanes the range @xmath40 , with the highest one well exceeding the theoretical stable limit .",
    "thus we should expect to see the limit - cycle behavior .",
    "in contrast to this expectation , however , observations show little variability , which convincingly indicates that they are thermally stable .",
    "recently , the non - existence of the thermal instability of radiation dominated thin disk has also been directly shown by three - dimensional mhd numerical simulation of shearing box ( hirose , krolik & blaes 2009 ) .",
    "some theoretical efforts have been made to solve this puzzle .",
    "one explanation was proposed by hirose , krolik & blaes ( 2009 ) .",
    "they argued that although the stress is proportional to the total pressure , the stress fluctuation precedes pressure fluctuations , contrary to the usual supposition that pressure controls the magnetic stress .",
    "this explains the thermal stability .",
    "an alternative explanation was proposed recently by zheng et al .",
    "they argue that the previous analytical analysis of thermal stability neglect the role of magnetic pressure , which usually accounts for @xmath41 of the total pressure thus be dynamically important .",
    "they show that if the magnetic pressure decreases with response to the increase of temperature of the accretion flow , the threshold of accretion rate above which the disk becomes unstable increases significantly compared to the case of not considering the magnetic pressure .",
    "the physical reason is that in this case the dependence of turbulent dissipation heating on temperature becomes weaker .",
    "we propose that the intermittent activity of compact radio sources is caused by the `` global compton scattering '' feedback effect in hot accretion flows .",
    "the idea of global compton scattering was first proposed by ostriker et al .",
    "( 1976 ) and cowie , ostriker & stark ( 1978 ) in the context of spherical accretion , and later investigated by esin ( 1997 ) , park & ostriker ( 2001 , 2007 ) , and yuan , xie & ostriker ( 2009 ; hereafter yxo09 ) for rotating accretion flows . here",
    "we briefly review the main results of yxo09 .",
    "most of the radiation comes from the innermost region of the accretion flow , @xmath42 .",
    "the radiation will propagate outward and heat the electrons at large radii via compton scattering . if the luminosity is high enough ,",
    "the electrons will be heated above their virial temperature thus we ca nt obtain the steady solution . in this case , yxo09 argue that the black hole activity will oscillate between an active and inactive phases .",
    "the quantitative results are as follows . given the existence of outflow in hot accretion flows , the mass accretion rate is a function of radius , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 being the accretion rate at the outer boundary @xmath45 . in yxo09 we adopt @xmath46 , following the modeling result of the supermassive black hole in sgr a * ( yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "we set @xmath47 , since this is the bondi radius for typical parameters of black hole mass @xmath48 and interstellar medium temperature @xmath49k , as in the present work .",
    "we find that when @xmath50 , or equivalently @xmath51 , the electron temperature at @xmath52 will be heated to be higher than the virial value thus no steady accretion solution exists .",
    "this radius is called virial radius .",
    "its value is found to be roughly anti - correlated with @xmath44 , @xmath53 , mainly in the sense that a larger @xmath44 corresponds to a smaller @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath44 ca nt be too small , since in that case the virial radius will be out of the bondi radius ( i.e. , the boundary of the accretion flow ) thus the calculations in yxo09 may fail .    in the present work we are satisfied with simple analytical calculations and estimations , but leave the detailed numerical simulation to the next step .",
    "first we note that the typical luminosity of the sources compiled in czerny et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is @xmath55 , consistent with the predicted threshold of luminosity in yxo09 above which the black hole activity oscillates due to the global compton heating . in the following",
    "we analyze this oscillation behavior in more detail , calculating the timescales of the active and inactive phases and comparing with observations .",
    "the readers are referred to fig . 1 for the schematic configuration of the two phases .",
    "we assume the mass of the black hole @xmath56 .",
    "the density and temperature of the ism at bondi radius are denoted as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this high temperature of @xmath59 is supported by the direct observations of some galactic centers , such as sgr a * ( baganoff et al . 2003 ) , some nearby galaxies ( pellegrini 2005 ) , and the radio galaxy m  87 ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2003 ) .",
    "theoretically , this could be because of the shock heating due to the collision between stellar winds ( quataert 2004 ) .",
    "the outer boundary of the accretion flow is set at the bondi radius , @xmath60 .    as we state above , when @xmath61 ( or equivalently @xmath62 ) , the gas at @xmath63 will be heated to be above the virial temperature thus will diffuse .",
    "the gas within @xmath64 can still be accreted , which powers the high - luminosity active phase .",
    "the duration of this phase is determined by the accretion timescale at @xmath64 , t_act~t_acc(r_vir)~ ~310 ^ 4m_8()^-1 ( ) ^-1 yr(narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) . for typical values of @xmath65 , as indicated by the observed @xmath66 , this timescale is in good agreement with the required duration of active phase in reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) . moreover , the sample compiled in czerny et al .",
    "( 2009 ) indicates that sources with higher luminosity have younger age .",
    "this is easy to understand from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , because for an adaf we roughly have @xmath67 thus @xmath68 .",
    "the temperature profile within @xmath69 has been calculated in yxo09 .",
    "now we estimate the temperature of the gas beyond @xmath52 , which is required to calculate the duration of the inactive phase .",
    "the temperature is mainly determined by the compton heating , viscous dissipation , and bremsstrahlung cooling ( we do nt consider other possible heating mechanisms for simplicity ) .",
    "cooling is usually negligible in an adaf . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "the compton heating reads ( yxo09 ) , q_comp = n_e ( _ x-_e)f_tn_e_xf_tr^-3.2 . here @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the radiation temperature characterizing the spectrum of radiation from the adaf , @xmath72 is the radiation flux , @xmath73 is thomson cross section .",
    "the value of @xmath71 can be well approximated to be ( yxo09 ) , t_x~10 ^ 9  k.note that this value is much larger than the typical value for the spectrum of luminous quasar , where @xmath74 ( sazonov et al .",
    "this is of course because of the significant difference between the seds of luminous agns and llagns ( ho 1999 ; ho 2008 ; yuan , xie & ostriker 2009 ) .",
    "the viscous heating rate is given by q_visn_e _",
    "i^1/2hr^2(d / dr)^2r^-3.7.in both eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , the scaling of an adaf ( with outflow ) @xmath75 and @xmath76 are adopted . at @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 , since this is why the electrons are heated to be above the virial temperature . eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) then imply that the heating is dominated by compton scattering at @xmath79 .",
    "the evolution of electron temperature is then described by n_ek = n_e(_x-_e)f_t .",
    "the solution is t_e = t_e0e^-at+t_x(1-e^-at).here @xmath80 is the electron temperature at the beginning of the active phase and @xmath81 .",
    "the heating timescale is the duration of the active phase @xmath82 , so the spatial range that electrons can be heated to @xmath71 is determined by at_act1.this gives r~()^1/2~10 ^ 6 r_sin the last calculation the typical values of @xmath61 and @xmath83 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) are adopted .",
    "so we obtain that the gas up to @xmath84 can be heated to compton temperature @xmath71 after the active phase .",
    "note that we neglect the bremsstrahlung cooling in our calculation , so this value should be regarded as an upper limit .    in correspondence with the increase of the temperature ,",
    "the density of the gas should become much lower than the unheated ism .",
    "the accretion of these low - density gas results in the significant decrease of mass accretion rate and the luminosity .",
    "the source then enters into the inactive phase .",
    "we denote the density as @xmath85 and estimate its value by the pressure balance of these gas with the surrounding ism , whose density and temperature are denoted as @xmath86 and @xmath87 : n_inact = n_ism=10 ^ -2n_ism .",
    "we estimate the mass accretion rate with the bondi accretion theory , so r_bondi~,and _",
    "inact~_bondi4r_bondi^2n_inact m_p c_s(r_bondi)t^-3/2n_inact.here @xmath88 is the viscous parameter , @xmath89 is the sound speed at @xmath90 .",
    "so the accretion rate is up to @xmath91 times lower in the inactive phase compared to the active phase , which is why the source becomes inactive .",
    "the compton heated gas from @xmath90 to @xmath92 will cool with time .",
    "the duration of the inactive phase should be determined by the depletion of the heated gas due to accretion , or the cooling of these heated gas , whichever is shorter .",
    "the former is hard to estimate since @xmath92 is well out of the influence sphere of the black hole .",
    "but it must be much longer than the accretion timescale determined by the adaf theory , i.e. , t_acc ~10 ^ 5 m_8()^-1  yr.the cooling timescale reads @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the bremsstrahlung emissivity .",
    "we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 , but what is the value of @xmath57 ? from our statement above , we know that the condition for the oscillation of the black hole activity is that the luminosity of the active phase is @xmath0 , or equivalently @xmath97 . given that @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 .",
    "so we have t_cool=10 ^ 5 m_8 ( ) ( ) ^1/2  yr.this determines the duration of the inactive phase because it is much shorter than the accretion timescale at @xmath100 ( eq .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the duration of the inactive phase required in reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we propose an agn feedback mechanism occurring at @xmath69 from the central black hole , i.e. , around parsec scale .",
    "the conditions for this effect to be present are that the accretion flow is described by hot accretion flow ( such as an adaf ) , and the accretion luminosity @xmath0 . _",
    "the influence of this effect is that the black hole will oscillate between an active and inactive phases , which last for @xmath101 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "_ such kind of short - timescale oscillation should be common in radio sources with @xmath0 .",
    "this result implies that even though the fueling rate of agns is constant at large scales , the radiation ( and also matter ) output from the agns oscillates .",
    "this behavior should be taken into account when we consider the effects of agns feedback at larger scales , especially those treating the small - scale accretion as the `` sub - grid '' input of their simulations .",
    "now let s compare our study with other works .",
    "one is the series of works by ciotti & ostriker ( 2001 ; 2007 ) . in their works , they focus on the radiative heating by the central agn to the ism , but on scales much larger than ours , from several pc to kpc .",
    "more physics , such as supernova heating , are included there .",
    "similar to our results , they also find that when the luminosity of the central agns is high , in their case close to @xmath102 , oscillation occurs .",
    "however , the timescale of oscillation is much longer , @xmath103 .",
    "one important reason is that the radiation temperature adopted in their model is much smaller , @xmath104 .",
    "physically , such a low @xmath71 corresponds to the typical spectrum of a quasar ( sazanov et al .",
    "2005 ) . while when the accretion rate is lower than a certain value , the accretion flow should make a transition from the standard thin disk to an adaf , as argued in narayan & yi ( 1995 ) and evidenced by the transition from a soft to a hard states in bhxbs .",
    "the spectrum emitted by adafs is significantly different from that of quasars , most significantly characterized by the lack of big - blue - bump , as we point out in  1 ( ho 1999 ; ho 2008 ) .",
    "the corresponding radiation temperature of such spectra is typically @xmath105 ( yxo09 ) .",
    "another possibly important point is the inner boundary of the simulation domain . from yxo09 ,",
    "the global compton scattering effect is already important at @xmath106 , i.e , at sub - pc or pc scales .",
    "but in ciotti & ostriker s works , they typically set the inner boundary at several pc .",
    "thus some important feedback effect may be missed .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting to repeat the simulations of ciotti & ostriker ( 2001 ; 2007 ) , but by taking into account the change of @xmath71 at low @xmath107 and the location of the inner boundary .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "another series of works are by proga and his collaborators ( e.g. , proga , stone & kallman 2000 ; proga 2007 ; kurosawa & proga 2009 ) . similar to our work , they focus on the sub - pc and pc scales .",
    "different from our work , but similar to ciotti & ostriker ( 2001 ; 2007 ) , they assume that the central radiation spectrum is quasar - like . another difference from our work is that they focus on cold accretion flows and higher mass accretion rates .",
    "however , since oscillation behavior was also found in their works , if the accretion rate decreases to such a low value that the accretion flow makes a transition from a thin disk to a hot accretion flow , @xmath108 should again be adopted .",
