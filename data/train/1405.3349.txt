    "since the pioneer work by kane and mele in 2005 , @xcite the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state has gathered great interest in the condensed matter field .",
    "qsh state is characterized by an insulating bulk and gapless helical edge states .",
    "@xcite the original candidate with qsh effect proposed by kane and mele @xcite was graphene in which spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) opens a gap at the dirac points and turns the semimetal into a topological insulator .",
    "however , soc in graphene was reported very weak such that qsh effect can be observed only at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite for stronger soc , heavier elements are possible candidates . honeycomb lattice formed by other elements of group iv , such as si and ge which are termed as silicene and germanene , respectively , are predicted to be stable as planar lattices by first - principles calculations .",
    "@xcite a prominent feature of these materials is the buckled geometry , which allows a tunable band gap via the vertical electric field .",
    "@xcite although silicene or germanene has not been successfully isolated yet , recent synthesis of silicene through epitaxial growth on silver substrate indicates the feasibility of realizing silicene and germanene .",
    "lalmi2010,vogt2012,lin2012 it is thus possible that silicene and germanene could follow the graphene and open new perspectives for applications , especially due to their compatibility with si - based electronics .",
    "in addition to the qsh state , another interesting state in graphene - related materials that has been proposed theoretically is the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) state .",
    "@xcite similar to the quantum hall state , the qah state is also an insulating state without time - reversal symmetry and is characterized by quantized hall conductance @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , the chern number ) and the presence of chiral edge states . however , unlike the quantum hall state which originates from quantized landau levels induced by magnetic fields , qah state arises by nontrivial topology of electronic states associated with soc and internal magnetization .",
    "@xcite some proposals of the qah effect on graphene have been suggested like via adatoms @xcite and proximity .",
    "@xcite due to the difficulty in controlling magnetization and soc , the qah effect has not been observed experimentally until very recently it is realized in a magnetically doped topological insulator of cr - doped ( bi , sb)@xmath3te@xmath4 , @xcite where the @xmath5 hall conductance has been observed in low temperatures around hundreds of mk .",
    "the realization of the qah states has revived hopes for using dissipationless edge states to develop low - power - consumption electronics . however , from fundamental and practical points of view , qah states with larger band gaps and larger chern numbers hjiang2012,qiao2013,jwang2013,cfang2014 have the advantage of a lower contact resistance and possible applications at higher temperatures .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to search for qah insulators with larger chern numbers and larger band gaps .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we explore qah effects driven by spontaneous ferromagnetic ( fm ) order induced by the hubbard @xmath0 interaction in a buckled honeycomb . while our theory and results apply to silicene as well , we shall take germanene as a prototype of buckled honeycomb lattices due to its larger spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we show that instead of doping the system using magnetic atoms , @xcite magnetism can be spontaneously induced by breaking sublattice symmetry through saturating chemical bonds on one - side of the buckled honeycomb lattice .",
    "one of the ways to saturate the chemical bonds is to hydrogenate silicene or germanene .",
    "@xcite ferromagnetism in semi - hydrogenated honeycomb structures has been reported by means of first - principles calculations for graphene jzhou2009 and silicene .",
    "@xcite in our work , we find that saturation of chemical bonds generally tends to localize electrons and results in flat bands .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of the hubbard @xmath0 interaction , spontaneous ferromagnetism is generally induced in the flat bands .",
    "the flat band ferromagnetism for the qah effect is studied on the dice lattice @xcite and a decorated lattice .",
    "@xcite here we investigate the qah effect in flat bands of one - side - saturated buckled honeycomb lattice for different saturation fractions characterized by @xmath6 with @xmath7 being an integer .",
    "for @xmath8 we find that the critical @xmath0 for ferromagnetism increases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the induced magnetization is directly related to the saturation fraction and is thus controllable in magnitude through the saturation fraction .",
    "furthermore , we find that qah states with @xmath9 or @xmath10 can be realized among these saturation fractions . specifically , the band gap of the system is given by the difference of the intrinsic soc ( @xmath11 ) and the fm gap ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for smaller magnetization , @xmath13 and the chern number is nonzero . as a result ,",
    "the chern number @xmath2 starts from @xmath14 for a smaller magnetization and becomes 0 when the magnetization is large enough ( a @xmath15 phase precedes the @xmath9 phase in the 1/4-vacancy system ) .",
    "the non - vanishing chern number for smaller magnetization implies that the associated qah effect tends to survive at high temperatures .",
    "our findings thus provide a potential method to engineer buckled honeycomb structures into high - temperature qah insulators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the theoretical model of partially saturated germanene ( or silicene ) with electron - electron interactions . here",
    "the saturation of chemical bonds is modeled as on - site impurity potentials on _ a _ sites with strength @xmath16 .",
    "we will focus on the infinite potential limit so that sites with saturated chemical bonds can be treated as vacancies .",
    "section iii is devoted to the case of semi - saturation in which all _ a _ sites are vacancies . in section iv , we investigate saturation fraction of _ a _ sites being 1/2 , 1/3 and 1/4 .",
    "we summary our results including those of the 1/5- and 1/6-vacancy systems and give discussions in sec . v.",
    "we start by modeling silicene and germanene using the kane - mele model on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the honeycomb lattice for germanene and silicene is different from that of graphene due to the buckled structure .",
    "two sublattices , labeled by _ a _ and _ b _ , are in different planes shifted by some distance . in the absence of interactions and impurities , the tight - binding model for both germanene and silicene is given by liu2011b , ezawa2012b @xmath17here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are indices for spin .",
    "the first term is the nearest - neighbor hopping ( between _ a _ and _ b _ sites ) .",
    "the second term is the intrinsic soc with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two unit vectors connecting _",
    "j _ and _ i_. the third term is the next - nearest - neighbor rashba soc where @xmath23 alternates sign between sublattices due to the buckled structure .",

    ", a finite coulomb interaction may reach the stoner criterion and generally results in ferromagnetism in the flat band .",
    "however , for the _ p_-orbital electronic system , the bandwidth is often too large so that the coulomb interaction is not strong enough to lift up the high degeneracy of ground states . in the following , we shall show that for a bipartite system , the asymmetry in two sublattice introduced by removing points in one sublattice can generally induce magnetism . for bipartite lattices without soc ,",
    "the induced magnetism results from the difference in number of lattice points in two sublattices and agrees with the expectation from the lieb s theorem .",
    "@xcite in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , removing points in one sublattice generally results in a flat band due to suppression of the nearest - neighbor hopping around vacancies .",

    "the physical reason of why strong ferromagnetism breaks the qah phase is that in a fully polarized band , the berry phase due to spins is suppressed .",
