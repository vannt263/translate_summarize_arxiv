    "( [ eqn : scale ] ) .",
    "since the radiation is strongly relativistic and strongly beamed in the forward direction , it will transform under the boost as e e = ef = s ^ 1/2 e . since the relevant parameters in the rescaled string are the same as in the boosted string the rescaled string will also release energy @xmath103 .",

    "we will use the canonical reference frame discussed earlier , in which @xmath105 is parallel to @xmath84 . is perpendicular to @xmath27 this tranformation gives @xmath106 . thus to third order in @xmath9 the two parts of the string lie on top of each other . only at fifth order are they separate , so the radiation emitted will be much larger than we calculate here .",
    "if one analyzes this cusp in the original frame , one finds that at times either before or after the time of the cusp the string nearly crosses itself .",
    "these near crossings also give rise to the large energy emission .",

    "the cross section of the string in this frame is not a circle of radius @xmath2 , but an ellipse with semimajor axis @xmath2 and semiminor axis @xmath109 in the direction of @xmath110 .",
    "now the overlap calculation reduces to the computation of the value of @xmath9 at which these two ellipses touch one another . as before we will only take into account effects of order @xmath9 .",

    "<S> the cusp whose motion is perpendicular to this plane , considered by some authors , is a special case and not the generic situation .    </S>",
    "<S> we redo the calculation of the energy in the region where the string overlaps itself near a cusp , which is the maximum energy that can be released in radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the motion of a generic cusp and the resulting lorentz contraction of the string core . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that the energy scales as @xmath0 instead of the usual value of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the string radius and @xmath3 and is the typical length scale of the string . since @xmath4 for cosmological strings , the radiation is strongly suppressed and could not be observed . </S>"
