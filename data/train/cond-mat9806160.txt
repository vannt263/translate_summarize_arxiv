    "quantum one - dimensional spin systems are characterized by a variety of behavior much richer than their higher - dimensional counterpart .",
    "for example , antiferromagnetic spin chains have different physical properties according to whether the spins are integer or half - integer@xcite .",
    "let us consider the prototypical heisenberg spin chain  : @xmath0 where i are the sites along the chain and @xmath1 quantum spin operators with @xmath2 .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath3 is positive , i.e. antiferromagnetic .",
    "then the s=1/2 chain is gapless and has algebraic decay of the spin correlations @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "the s=1 chain has a quite different physics  : the isotropic antiferromagnetic chain is in the haldane phase .",
    "there is a gap for spin excitations and the correlations decay exponentially .",
    "when adding anisotropy , this haldane phase survives in a region of parameters around the isotropic point@xcite .",
    "when anisotropies become too large , then the system is eventually driven towards more conventional ferro or antiferro phases@xcite .",
    "this spin-1 chain is closely related to the two - leg spin-1/2 ladder . in the ladder system ,",
    "one is dealing with two s=1/2 spin chains coupled by rungs perpendicular to the chains .",
    "the ladder has a gap for all values of the perpendicular coupling .",
    "in fact , it is known that the s=1 chain and the two - leg spin ladder share the same low - energy effective field theory@xcite .",
    "understanding the influence of disorder on such spin systems is an important issue . in all real materials",
    "there is of course some amount of disorder .",
    "one of the probe of the physics of the system is to introduce artificially defects or impurities .",
    "the study of disorder in one - dimensional quantum systems is also of considerable theoretical interest@xcite .",
    "recently it has been realized that it is possible to obtain exact results in such disordered systems , while this is generally impossible in the classical realm .    in the case of the spin-1/2 chain ,",
    "one simple kind of disorder is a distribution of quenched bond disorder .",
    "the real - space renormalization group@xcite study shows that the ground state is a collection of singlet bonds over arbitrarily large distances in a random pattern according to the initial distribution of randomness .",
    "this is the so - called random singlet phase@xcite .",
    "the influence of weak disorder on the spin-1/2 chain has been also studied by means of a renormalization group ( rg ) study on the effective field theory@xcite .",
    "this method is a perturbative rg calculation but it is easy to study widely different kinds of disorder . the real - space rg method has also been applied to systems with a distribution of ferro- and antiferromagnetic bonds@xcite as well as dimerized systems@xcite .",
    "there are also direct numerical studies@xcite .    in the case of the spin-1 chain we are dealing with a gapped system that has also some hidden long - range order",
    "as exhibited by the approximate valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) ground state wavefunctions@xcite .",
    "certainly one expects the influence of disorder to be quite different@xcite .",
    "a real - space rg has been performed on the isotropic s=1 chain@xcite .",
    "it shows that there is destruction of the haldane gap beyond a nonzero disorder strength , then there is a gapless phase which sustains the hidden long - range order and then for even stronger disorder one finds the featureless random - singlet phase .",
    "this is analogous to the doping of conventional superconductors with magnetic impurities@xcite  : here the hidden long - range order plays the role of the superconducting condensate .    in this paper",
    "we study the s=1 spin chain with exchange and single - ion anisotropies .",
    "this model has a rich phase diagram and the influence of disorder is extremely sensitive to the nature of the ground state of the unperturbed system .",
    "we use a perturbative rg treatment of the disorder on the effective field theory .",
    "the average over the disorder is performed by use of the replica trick as pioneered by giamarchi and schulz@xcite in the context of the one - dimensional electron gas .",
    "here we perform the calculation up to second order in the disorder strength .",
    "this is important as shown by fujimoto and kawakami@xcite because , at this order of perturbation , one captures the interplay between interactions and disorder when they are both relevant . in the spin-1/2 case",
    "they have shown that it is possible to explicitly obtain from the rg treatment the destruction of the antiferromagnetic phase under a random z - axis magnetic field for an arbitrarily small amount of randomness as predicted by the argument of imry and ma@xcite .",
    "the case of the spin ladder@xcite is closely related to our work but the relevant operators are not always the same . in the spin-1 chain",
    "there are operators generated by disorder that involve products of the two spin-1/2 operators used to describe the spin-1 degrees of freedom .",
    "they do not exist in the ladder case .    in section",
    "ii , we give the construction of the effective bosonic theory for anisotropic s=1 chain without randomness . in section iii , we translate in the bosonic language , the operators induced by the disorder .",
    "section iv shows why gapped phases are in general stable under weak disorder .",
    "section v contains the derivation of the renormalization group equations .",
    "section vi gives the results of our study on each phase of the s=1 chain .",
    "finally section vii contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we give the construction of the effective bosonic low - energy theory for the s=1 spin chain .",
    "we will use this continuum theory as a starting point for the treatment of randomness in sect .",
    "we concentrate on the anisotropic heisenberg s=1 antiferromagnetic spin chain with the following hamiltonian  : @xmath6 the @xmath7 are s=1 quantum spin operators , @xmath8 is the exchange anisotropy and @xmath9 is the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "all energies are measured in units of @xmath3 .",
    "the phase diagram of this model is well - known in the absence of disorder@xcite .",
    "there are two phases with conventional long - range magnetic order  : a ferromagnetic ( f ) phase for @xmath8 large and negative and an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase for @xmath8 large and positive . in the intermediate regime",
    ", there is the haldane phase ( h ) which is gapped and has no obvious long - range order . in particular it does not break translational or rotational symmetry",
    "there are two gapless xy - like phases that differ only in the behaviour of the spin correlations .",
    "finally , when @xmath9 is very large and positive there is a non - magnetic phase which is trivially obtained by perturbation theory from the strong - coupling limit where the ground state has all spins set to @xmath10  : @xmath11 , called the large - d phase ( d ) in what follows .",
    "the starting point is to write each spin-1 operator as the sum of two spin-1/2 operators @xmath12 , an approximation suggested by luther and peschel@xcite .",
    "it has been shown by schulz that abelian bosonization@xcite is able to reproduce most of the phase diagram .",
    "one first performs a jordan - wigner transformation on each spin-1/2 @xmath13 and @xmath14 by introducing two species of spinless fermions .",
    "explicitly we write  :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a fermion operator and similarly one introduces a @xmath17 fermion for the other set of spins-1/2 @xmath18 . since one is interested in the long - wavelength , low - energy behaviour , it is then convenient to take the continuum limit by introducing two continuous fermi fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ s1 ] ) leads then to a theory of two interacting fermi fields in one space dimension .",
    "the physical content of this fermi system is obtained by translation into the language of interacting bosons@xcite .",
    "in fact , in one space dimension a theory involving a fermi field @xmath21 can be translated in a bose field theory by the following relations  :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the chiral components of a bose field  : @xmath25 .",
    "thus there are two bose fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 corresponding to the two fermions @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the effective theory for the spin-1 chain",
    "can be simplified by use of the natural `` acoustic '' and `` optic '' linear combinations  : @xmath30 the bose theory can then be written as  : @xmath31 where the a - sector is a sine - gordon theory  : @xmath32 + \\frac{g_1}{(\\pi \\alpha)^2 } \\cos ( \\sqrt{8 \\pi}\\phi_a ) , \\label{sg}\\ ] ] and the o - sector is a _",
    "generalized _ sine - gordon theory  : @xmath33 + \\frac{g_2}{(\\pi \\alpha)^2 } \\cos ( \\sqrt{8 \\pi}\\phi_o ) + \\frac{g_3}{(\\pi \\alpha)^2 } \\cos ( \\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\tilde{\\phi}_o ) .",
    "\\label{gsg}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is the dual field of @xmath35 , and the couplings are given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 at first order in @xmath38 .",
    "the velocities @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the two parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 are also functions of the initial parameters of the problem and can be computed to the first order in @xmath9 and @xmath8  : @xmath43 contrary to the case of the s=1/2 chain , there are no exact results on the values of the couplings @xmath41 , @xmath42 as functions of the bare parameters @xmath9 and @xmath8 . strictly speaking , there are operators coupling the two fields @xmath44 and @xmath35 in eq.([btheo ] ) but they are less relevant than the interactions in eq.([sg ] ) and eq.([gsg ] ) .",
    "the physics of the a - sector is well - known  : there is a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition separating a massless phase with algebraic quasi - long range order from a massive phase in which the field @xmath44 has a definite vacuum expectation value .",
    "the transition takes place when the operator @xmath45 becomes relevant according to the value of the parameter @xmath41  : this happens for @xmath46 . in the massive regime",
    "@xmath47 the field @xmath44 acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath48 fixed by the minimum of the cosine operator appearing in the energy . in the massless regime ,",
    "correlations functions decay algebraically with powers dictated by the value of the coupling @xmath49 .",
    "the physics of the o - sector is less transparent  : it involves now the dual field @xmath50 which is a non - local operator as a function of @xmath51 . in the coulomb gas language ,",
    "this theory has both electric and magnetic charges .",
    "in fact , den nijs@xcite has shown that this effective theory appears also in the coulomb gas representation of the xy model with ising anisotropy .",
    "since this model undergoes an _ ising _ phase transition between two massive phases , we expect the same to be true for the generalized sine - gordon theory ( [ gsg ] ) .",
    "the different phases of the s=1 spin chain can be characterized from the behavior of the effective theories ( [ sg ] ) and ( [ gsg ] ) . in the af phase , both fields @xmath44 and @xmath35 have a vacuum expectation value . in the haldane and large - d phase it is now @xmath44 and @xmath52 that have expectation values .",
    "it is the ising transition of the theory ( [ gsg ] ) that takes place between af and haldane and also between af and large - d .",
    "the difference between the haldane and large - d phases is only the sign in front of the operator @xmath45 .",
    "thus it is the value of the condensate @xmath53 that differs between the haldane and large - d phases .",
    "when the coefficient of the operator @xmath45 is zero , there is a massless line in the phase diagram separating h and d. when @xmath49 is large enough , the field @xmath44 is massless  : when @xmath35 condenses it the xy2 phase while @xmath52 condenses in xy1 phase .",
    "these characteristics are summarized in table  1 ( where `` dis '' means that the corresponding field has no mean value and is disordered ) .",
    "finally , there is a ferromagnetic phase ( f ) where bosonization breaks down  : at the f boundary the velocity @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "the f phase is beyond the scope of our study and will not be discussed .",
    "the phase boundaries are in good agreement with the more detailed picture of den nijs and rommelse@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the first - order expressions for @xmath49 and @xmath54 in eqs.([first ] ) lead to straight lines for the phase boundaries while in reality there are tricritical points , i.e. between haldane , large - d and af phases .",
    "they are also out of reach of the bosonization method at the order which is considered here .",
    "in this section we describe an approximate treatment of quenched randomness in the bosonized theory obtained in sect .",
    "we give the operators that should be added to the bosonic field theory ( [ btheo ] ) to describe randomness .",
    "we first list the various kinds of randomness that we have been able to treat .",
    "we will consider the effects of a random field along the z - axis .",
    "we add to the hamiltonian a term  : @xmath55 where the local fields @xmath56 are gaussian random variables with zero mean , uncorrelated from site to site  : @xmath57 the bar means average over the random distribution and the variance of the distribution is @xmath58 , characterizing the strength of the disorder .",
    "this kind of disorder preserves the rotational symmetry around the z - axis which a symmetry of the spin hamiltonian .",
    "it is known from the imry - ma argument@xcite that it has a dramatic effect on the phases with long - range magnetic order  : an arbitrarily small amount of random z - field destroy the ordering .",
    "we consider also the case of a random planar field , i.e. lying in the xy plane  : @xmath59 with @xmath60 the rotational symmetry is destroyed in this case .",
    "we treat random planar exchange  : @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "finally randomness may break xy - symmetry by random planar anisotropy  : @xmath63 with @xmath64 .    when bosonizing the spin operators in eqs .",
    "( [ zf],[pf],[pe],[pa ] ) , there is one part with small momenta @xmath65 and one part with @xmath66 .",
    "for example , in the zf case we have  : @xmath67 in the continuum limit .",
    "inserted in eq.([zf ] ) this formula will pick the @xmath68 part of the fluctuating field @xmath56 as well as the @xmath66 part  : @xmath69 with  : @xmath70 in fact this formula is generic for all kinds of disorder .",
    "we have listed in table ii the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 corresponding to all cases cited above .",
    "we have kept only the most relevant operators in the renormalization group sense .",
    "the continuous random fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 are also gaussian . to treat the quenched disorder",
    "we follow the replica trick  : we introduce @xmath75 copies of the system and compute the free energy as @xmath76 . integrating over",
    "the gaussian disorder @xmath77 leads in the euclidean effective action to the following operator  : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the variance of @xmath77 , @xmath80 are replica indices .",
    "it is important to note that this operator is not local  : since the random field @xmath77 is quenched i.e. does not depend on time , the gaussian integration leads to the two - time integral in eq.([diso1 ] ) .",
    "we obtain exactly similar formulas for all operators given in table ii . in each case",
    "there is a variance @xmath81 corresponding to the gaussian random field coupled to the operator considered .",
    "we will use the obvious notation @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and so on .",
    "the disorder strengths are noted also @xmath85 , @xmath86 ,  .",
    "the @xmath82 operator corresponds to a forward scattering process in the language of the jordan - wigner fermions . when written as a bosonic operator it may be absorbed by a change of variable in the path integral over the field @xmath44 which leads to simple leading - order rg calculations@xcite , when interactions in the a - sector are irrelevant . here",
    "we will retain this @xmath82 operator explicitly in our rg treatment because , when its strength diverges , it leads to a very important phenomenon  : the vanishing of the critical disorder strength for massive phases .",
    "it is important to note that the most relevant @xmath87 operators are , in all cases over study , always given by @xmath83 .",
    "this is due to the fact that even when @xmath83 does not appear at the bare level , it is generated by renormalization  : this has been pointed out first by doty and fisher in the study of the s=1/2 chain@xcite . in our case a similar reasoning leads immediately to the appearance of @xmath83 in the pf case as well as in the pa case ( in the zf and pe case , @xmath83 appear at the bare level )    the operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 are specific to the s=1 spin chain as opposed to the spin ladder  : they come from the cross coupling @xmath90 that occurs when expressing s=1 spin operators into s=1/2 entities . in the spin ladder",
    "it would be replaced by @xmath91 across the rung .",
    "the operators of the type ( [ diso1 ] ) break the lorentz invariance which is present in the effective field theory of the pure system .",
    "this means that in a renormalization group calculation many new operators will be generated in addition to those introduced at the bare level . in principle",
    "it is thus extremely difficult to keep the rg flow under control . in the rg calculation at second order that we performed ,",
    "we have to add for internal rg consistency only three new operators  :    @xmath92    where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "they are called @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 in what follows .",
    "in this section we perform a second - order rg treatment of the bosonic theory given by the field theory eq .",
    "( [ btheo ] ) perturbed by the operators of the type ( [ diso1 ] ) .",
    "there are five distinct bare operators ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath89 , @xmath88 ) and three generated by renormalization ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) .",
    "the perturbation theory can start only from the massless theory with no cosine operators @xmath100 in eq.([btheo ] ) .",
    "we write the effective theory including randomness as  : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the massless theory characterized by @xmath49 and @xmath54 , @xmath103 is the cut - off and @xmath104 is the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath105 .",
    "the beta functions of the couplings @xmath106 are then given by the following formula  : @xmath107 where the wilson coefficients @xmath108 are obtained from the operator product expansion  : @xmath109 this procedure gives the beta function for an arbitrary number of replicas and is very useful in order to find which operators are generated by renormalization .",
    "while this technique can be applied straightforwardly to local operators like those appearing in the sine - gordon or generalized sine - gordon theories , this is not so when dealing with the non - local operators ( [ diso1 ] ) generated by randomness .",
    "we will take into account only the strongest singularities ( which are in @xmath110 ) in the ope containing nonlocal operators , and assume that the ope is still valid .",
    "we now sum up the renormalization group equations of the system . in the replica @xmath111 limit",
    ", we obtain the flow for the cosine couplings  :    [ ys ]",
    "@xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114    where @xmath115 , @xmath116 . in the first equation ( [ y1 ] ) , in the absence of disorder the renormalization eigenvalue @xmath117 leads to a massive phase when @xmath118  : the cosine is relevant since @xmath119 scales to infinity in this case .",
    "this picture may be altered since the randomness leads to an additional _ second - order _ coupling @xmath120 between the strength of the interaction and the forward scattering term @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath121 scales fast enough to infinity then it can revert the flow of @xmath119 and leads to the destruction of the massive phase .",
    "this behaviour has been obtained in the case of the hubbard model by fujimoto and kawakami@xcite .",
    "we will show later that this happens also in the case of the spin chain under study . of course to capture such phenomena ,",
    "it is important to deal explicitly with @xmath82 instead of eliminating it by a change of variables in the functional integral .",
    "there are also two flow equations for the stiffness constants  :    [ ks ] @xmath122",
    "@xmath123    where @xmath124 .",
    "the operators that do not involve gradients have simple renormalization properties .",
    "in fact they scale according to the dimension that can be found immediately from the massless theory  :    [ dees ] @xmath125 @xmath126",
    "@xmath127 @xmath128    these equations allow immediate statements about the stability of the massless phases according to the relevance or irrelevance of the random operators .",
    "this simplicity however does not extend to the operators @xmath82 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 because they appear in the ope of various combinations of the other operators .",
    "the rg equations thus couple the various random perturbations  :    [ moredees ] @xmath129 @xmath130    equations similar to ( [ moredees ] ) hold also for the couplings @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the second - order terms in the flow equations above involve the following functions  :    @xmath133 ^ 2 ,   \\quad g(u ) = \\left [ \\int^{+\\infty}_{-\\infty } \\frac{dy}{(1+y^2)^{1/8k_a } ( 1+u^2 y^2)^{1/8k_o } } \\right]^2 ,   \\label{functions1}\\ ] ]    @xmath134 ^ 2 ,   \\quad k(u ) = \\left [ \\int^{+\\infty}_{-\\infty } \\frac{dy}{(1+u^2 y^2)^{1/2k_o } } \\right]^2 .\\ ] ]    it is important to note that these functions are not well - defined for all values of the stiffness constants @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we will show in the following section that these divergences lead to the disappearance of the ising - ordered phase for an arbitrarily weak random z - field , as predicted by the imry - ma argument .",
    "armed with the flow equations ( [ ys],[ks],[dees],[moredees ] ) , we can study the phase diagram of the s=1 chain in the presence of the various kinds of randomness listed in table ii . before embarking in the general case",
    ", we briefly discuss a simplified model that display most of the behaviour of the complete theory  : @xmath135 @xmath136 defining @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , where u is the velocity , we derive the following renormalization group equations for y , d and k  :    [ reno ] @xmath139    the corresponding rg flow is given in figure  2 when @xmath140 . here , the crucial parameter is the stiffness constant k , because it governs the relative relevance of interaction and disorder operators .",
    "for instance , if k flows to zero for small initial disorder , the disorder operator will become irrelevant , whereas the interaction operator is relevant .",
    "if the pure case corresponds to a regime where interactions are relevant , the presence of infinitesimally small ( but finite ) disorder will not affect this behavior .",
    "the value of @xmath141 in the pure case is enough to predict the qualitative behavior of the system under weak disorder at this order of perturbation theory .",
    "it is clear that the massive phase will persist up to some critical disorder which , strictly speaking , is outside of reach of perturbation theory . a formal proof of stability is given in appendix a. the flow equations ( [ reno ] ) are only first - order .",
    "the interest of our second - order study will appear in the study of the ising - ordered phase .    finally , we comment on the correctness of the bosonization approach .",
    "since the scheme we use is perturbation improved by use of the renormalization group then we ca nt say much about the flow to strong coupling .",
    "the phases that are unstable can not be characterized by our tools .",
    "we can only find whether or not the randomness will have an immediate effect on the system . even in the stable case ,",
    "we of course expect that for strong enough disorder the physics of the system will change through a phase transition of some kind .",
    "this strategy has been applied with some success in the s=1/2 chain in a random z - field ans in the related problem of 1d fermions with attractive interactions submitted to a random site potential .",
    "bosonization@xcite predicts stability of the xy phase of the s=1/2 chain in the region @xmath142 and there is ample evidence for the correctness of this result@xcite from direct numerical studies .",
    "our general study should be followed by attacks by similar methods for an independent consistency check .",
    "in this section , we exploit the rg flow equations obtained previously to discuss the influence of randomness on the phase diagram of the s=1 spin chain phase diagram pictured in fig .",
    "we begin our discussion by the massive phases , with and without long - range spin order .",
    "all our findings are summarized in table iii .",
    "the key element of the stability is the operator @xmath83 since it is present in all kinds of randomness .",
    "this phase is characterized by the following ir stiffness constants in the pure case : @xmath143 .",
    "for such a fixed point , the functions appearing at second - order in eqs .",
    "( [ moredees ] ) take the values @xmath144 while the function @xmath145 ( [ functions1 ] ) is singular .",
    "the @xmath83 operator is _ relevant _ in this phase .",
    "since the cosine interaction is relevant in the a - sector , it seems that we are in a case with interaction and disorder that are relevant .",
    "however , the second - order beta functions allow a more precise conclusion  : when @xmath146 and @xmath147 flow to a small enough value then @xmath145 diverges .",
    "when approaching this singular point , @xmath85 becomes arbitrarily large even for infinitesimally small values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in eq .",
    "( [ y1 ] ) , the coupling @xmath120 becomes so large that the interaction @xmath119 is driven to zero .",
    "we infer thus that the mott - like gap of the ising phase is immediately destroyed by disorder , i.e. by infinitesimal disorder .    in the case of a random z - field , this is really what we predict from the imry - ma reasoning . in the case of the random planar field and random planar anisotropy ,",
    "the random z - field is generated by the rg process so this is why there is also destruction of the ising phase .",
    "the only trouble with the bosonization treatment is that it also leads to instability under random planar exchange , a fact which is not expected from the imry - ma argument . since stability in this case",
    "is expected we see this as a problem of our approach ( if we apply the same treatment to the s=1/2 case then one finds also instability under random planar exchange of the corresponding ising phase ) .",
    "however this approach correctly reproduces the immediate destruction of the gap in the ising phase .      in the renormalization group equations , nothing distinguishes the h and d phases .",
    "so we expect that they behave in the same way under disorder .",
    "these phases are characterized by @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath44 has a vacuum expectation value .",
    "the function @xmath145 is now well defined when we reach the unperturbed fixed point , and near this fixed point , @xmath152 .",
    "the operators @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath88 are _",
    "irrelevant_. this implies immediately stability under random xy symmetry - breaking exchange . concerning the random fields",
    ", we note that the random forward scattering @xmath85 scales as @xmath153 while @xmath119 and @xmath154 scale faster as @xmath155 according to eqs .",
    "( [ cc],[y1],[y3 ] ) .",
    "thus there is no possibility of destruction of the role of interactions contrary to the case of the af phase .",
    "thus there is stability under random z - field as well as under random xy - field .",
    "the only special case is the random xy - symmetric coupling .",
    "the @xmath89 operator is relevant and the function k(u ) is singular .",
    "this drives the @xmath99-operator to large negative values of @xmath156 .",
    "this goes outside the reach of perturbation theory .",
    "but for such large negative values , @xmath154 scales much faster than the disorder like @xmath157 .",
    "we take this as an indication of the robustness of the gap against disorder .",
    "so we expect stability also in this case .",
    "the two gapped phases without long - range spin order are thus stable , up to some critical strength of the disorder presumably , which is beyond the reach of the methods we employ here .      in this phase ,",
    "the a - sector is gapless , and the @xmath83 operator is irrelevant near the unperturbed fixed point in the whole phase so instabilities can appear only through the other operators induced by randomness .",
    "@xmath158 random z - field  : the forward scattering @xmath82 operator can be absorbed by a field redefinition .",
    "thus the excitation spectrum is unchanged and the correlation functions are affected in a simple way@xcite .",
    "@xmath158 random xy field  : the @xmath84 operator is relevant ; so the phase is unstable . in this case",
    ", we note that the function @xmath159 is singular , so the @xmath82 operator is singular too and scale to @xmath160 .",
    "@xmath158 random xy symmetric coupling  : the @xmath89 operator is relevant , as in the haldane / large - d phase .",
    "the same discussion apply  : the stability of the o - sector lead us to conclude that the xy1 phase remains stable under this kind of disorder .",
    "@xmath158 random xy symmetry - breaking coupling  : the @xmath88 operator is relevant and the @xmath103-sector is not gapped ; so the phase is unstable .",
    "the operator leading to the instability is different from the ladder case because it involves @xmath161 couplings that are typical of the s=1 case .",
    "this line is characterized by @xmath162 , so that the field @xmath44 is a free massless field .",
    "there is no gap along this line in the @xmath103-sector .",
    "it can be seen as an extension of the xy1 phase .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath41 is renormalized by disorder and @xmath42 flows to infinity .",
    "thus , the function @xmath159 is equal to zero , whereas @xmath163 is either finite or singular according to the value of @xmath41 .",
    "the stability discussion is exactly the same as that of the xy1 phase apart from the random xy field .",
    "the novelty is that @xmath41 may be less than 1 but the a - sector is still massless so there is a transition line in the @xmath164 plane , corresponding to a critical value of @xmath165=1/12 . for @xmath166 , the line we consider is unstable under weak pf disorder .",
    "the line starts from the xy1 boundary for which @xmath167 and crosses the frontier line between af and h phases .",
    "the stiffness @xmath41 decreases along the line but we do not know if it reaches the value 1/12 before arriving at the tricritical point .",
    "we conclude that the line is unstable under a random xy field at least in the neighborhood of the xy phase .",
    "this phase is characterized by the following ir values in the pure case  : @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we are in a most interesting case in which the operator @xmath83 may be either relevant or irrelevant within the bulk of this phase according to the scaling equation ( [ de1 ] ) .",
    "we first consider the influence of the random z - field  : we just need to consider the a - sector and the operator @xmath83 , which simplifies the calculation and does not change the result ( the random forward scattering @xmath82 does not change the global picture ) . the _ effective _ renormalization group equations are then at lowest order ( since the function @xmath159 is not singular near the ir pure fixed point , nothing new happens at the next order )  :    @xmath170    in each plane @xmath171 and @xmath172 , the flow has a simple form .",
    "we can draw the corresponding renormalization flow in the three dimensional space  : it is given in figure  3 .",
    "we observe that the @xmath83 operator breaks the xy2 phase into two phases .",
    "the first one ( for large k ) is a massless phase stable under small disorder , and the interaction term also flows to zero ; the other phase is unstable under weak disorder .",
    "thus the xy2 phase is only _ partially _ stable under small disorder , and this is consistent with physical intuition . indeed ,",
    "when the single - ion @xmath173 term becomes large and negative , we expect that the s=1 spin chain will behave as the s=1/2 spin chain . as shown by doty and fisher for the s=1/2 spin chain ,",
    "there is a region of exchange parameter @xmath8 stable under weak disorder ( it is also a superfluid phase arising for the disordered boson gas ; see giamarchi and schulz ) . in the s=1/2 spin chain , this stability region is located in the interval @xmath174 . in the s=1 case",
    ", we find that such a stable phase also exists for k large enough , and this is consistent with the fact that we should recover the s=1/2 behavior .    in the case of a random xy field",
    ", since there is a random z - field generated we are in the same situation as above . for the random xy symmetric coupling , the @xmath89 operator is irrelevant and the above discussion is again valid .    in the random xy symmetry - breaking case , the @xmath88 operator is always relevant whereas the @xmath103-sector is ungapped .",
    "thus , the chain is unstable .",
    "this is again consistent in the limit of large negative @xmath9 with the doty and fisher results for the s=1/2 chain .",
    "finally , we briefly comment the case of random z - exchange that we have not considered yet in this paper . in terms of the s=1 spins",
    ", it is given by  : @xmath175 . when written with",
    "the two kinds of spins s=1/2 , terms of the form @xmath176 appear .",
    "they lead to @xmath177 when expressed in the boson language , a coupling that has not been studied in the context of spin ladders .",
    "the @xmath178 leads to an operator which is relevant in haldane phase , and make the forward scattering @xmath82 singular and infinite with the consequence of vanishing interactions in the a - sector .",
    "the af phase is also unstable  : the @xmath83 operator is also contained in the boson expression of this kind of disorder , as if a random z - field was generated .",
    "these instabilities clearly deserve more studies .",
    "this problem appears also in the s=1/2 case@xcite .",
    "the xy1 phase is stable while xy2 is unstable .",
    "we have performed a renormalization group study of the influence of disorder on the effective theory which describes the s=1 chain .",
    "the rg equations allow a discussion of the stability of the various phases of the system .",
    "our discussion includes the effects of the second order of the renormalization group calculation .",
    "this allows us to capture the imry - ma destruction of the af phase .",
    "the gapped haldane and large - d phases are stable under all kinds of disorder we have studied : random z - field , random xy field and random xy symmetric and antisymmetric exchange . on the contrary ,",
    "the af phase which is also gapped is less stable .",
    "in fact , our rg calculation that goes up to the second order in the disorder strength shows that the phase is unstable to an arbitrarily weak random z - field , in agreement with the imry - ma argument .",
    "it is also unstable under random xy - field and random planar anisotropy since these perturbations do generate a random z - field .    concerning the gapless xy phases",
    ", then again the situation is quite rich .",
    "the xy1 phase is stable under random z - field and random planar exchange while it is immediately unstable under perturbations breaking the planar symmetry  : random xy - field and planar anisotropy .",
    "the xy2 phase is only partially stable under random fields and random planar exchange . in this case",
    "the phase breaks up into two parts : there is a stable massless domain with irrelevant disorder and another domain with relevant disorder .",
    "finally xy2 is totally unstable under random planar anisotropy .    with respect to the closely related problem of 2-leg spin ladder ,",
    "the effective theory is the same but the the pe and pa type of disorder leads to different operators in the bosonization approach . as a consequence , there are some instabilities that are induced by a different mechanism  : this happens in the massless phases xy1 and xy2 and also along the line separating the haldane and large - d phases .",
    "of course it remains to characterize more completely the phases in which the disorder is relevant . in our calculation",
    ", we can simply observe that the system flows to strong coupling but the methods we use are not informative on its fate .",
    "an outstanding problem is to describe in a unified manner the weak - coupling regime we observe here with the regime probed by the real - space rg calculations .",
    "the gapless phase with hidden long - range order of the random spin-1 chain@xcite appears presumably only beyond some critical strength and it seems to be out of reach of the methods we have used in this paper .",
    "_ note added : _ a recent work by y. nishiyama on the effect of a random z - field on the haldane gap and the xy1 phase is in agreement with our findings ( see e - print cond - mat/9805110 )    we thank m. bauer , d. bernard , o. golinelli , c. monthus for useful discussions .",
    "we thank also s. fujimoto for discussions about the s=1/2 case .",
    "the pure sg system is gapped when @xmath179 .",
    "we call @xmath180 and @xmath181 a solution of the pure differential system .",
    "we set @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to  : @xmath184 from the flow equations , we have @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "furthermore , the initial values of the functions @xmath188 and @xmath189 are 0 . from this statement",
    ", we can solve exactly the differential system for @xmath188 and @xmath189 if we replace @xmath190 by @xmath191 .",
    "we get  : @xmath192 where the functions f and g obey the following differential system  : @xmath193 if we choose a small @xmath194 , it is possible to find @xmath195 so that @xmath196 .",
    "moreover , we know that the real function @xmath188 is inferior to @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a known function ; so we can choose the initial value of d(l ) so that @xmath199 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath200 . because of the positivity of the functions @xmath188 and @xmath189 , we know that @xmath201 for all l , and so @xmath202 .",
    "this inequality proves that for sufficiently small @xmath203 , we can also have @xmath204 .",
    "this argument shows that , for all @xmath194 , there is a positive @xmath205 and a small enough @xmath203 so that @xmath206 and @xmath204 . for @xmath195 , @xmath207 . as a result , the disorder contribution in @xmath208 will decrease to 0 as fast as @xmath209 , whereas the other term will decrease slower than @xmath210 .",
    "thus this last term dominates the value of @xmath208 which remains negative for all @xmath211 .",
