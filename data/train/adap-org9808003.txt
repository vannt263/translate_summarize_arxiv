    "the present paper is devoted to one of the fundamental problems of how complex `` living '' systems widely met in nature can adapt to changes in the environment . by the term `` living '' system we mean one that comes into being , provides for itself , and develops pursuing its own goals .",
    "this class comprises a great variety of biological and ecological systems . besides",
    ", economic systems can be also placed into such a class because their occurrence , growth , and development is due to self - organization processes . to make the subject of our analysis more clear",
    "let us , first , specify the main properties of the systems we deal with .",
    "the elements of such a system , first , should be permanently supplied with external `` nutritious '' products for their life activities .",
    "second , in order for its elements to subsist special conditions are required .",
    "the latter are implemented through these elements making up a certain medium ( which will be referred below as to a `` living '' medium ) whose state is controlled by keeping its basic parameters inside certain vital intervals .    as a rule",
    "both of these requirements are fulfilled by a supplying network which provides the elements with nutrients as well as controls the living medium state . since the external products usually penetrate into the system through a common entryway and , then",
    ", should be delivered to a great number of elements the flow of these products has to branch many times until it reaches these elements .",
    "so the supplying network is to be organized hierarchically and to involve many levels .",
    "let us , now , present typical examples of such systems .",
    "first , this is living tissue , where blood flowing through a vascular network supplies cells with oxygen , nutritious products , etc . at the same time blood",
    "withdraws carbon dioxide and other products resulting from the cell life activities , keeping their concentrations inside the vital intervals ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . in this",
    "way blood flow controls also the tissue temperature @xcite .",
    "we note that the temperature and the concentration of carbon dioxide ( or a similar substance ) are major parameters characterizing the living tissue state @xcite , because their values are directly determined by the life activities of cells . in order to supply with blood each small group of cells the vascular network or ,",
    "more precisely , its arterial and venous beds are approximately of the tree form and involve many vessels of various lengths and diameters .",
    "the regional self - regulation processes keep the carbon dioxide concentration and the temperature inside certain vital intervals only in which living tissue can function normally ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar example is a respiratory system where oxygen going through a hierarchical network of bronchial tubes reaches small capillaries .",
    "second , large firms are a clear example of economic hierarchical systems .",
    "managers of all functions and of all levels make up a management network @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the management network controls both the money flow toward the organization low level comprising workers and also the flow of products in the opposite direction . in performing technological processes",
    "the wages paid to workers actually transform into the firm products .",
    "the existence of tremendous amount of goods in the market , in contrast to a relatively small number of raw materials shows that there also must be large hierarchical systems supplying the consumers with goods . the goods flow after reaching the consumers transforms into money flow in the opposite direction @xcite",
    ". in particular , self - organization phenomena can give rise to trade networks of the tree form @xcite .",
    "concerning ecological systems we would like to note that they are also complex in structure and can involve a larger number of `` predator - prey '' levels @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of ecosystems is governed by biomass and energy flow on trophic networks and under certain conditions leads to formation of the tree like trophic networks @xcite .",
    "keeping in mind the aforementioned examples let us represent a living system as one consisting of a living medium and a supplying network which involves supplying and draining beds of the tree form ( fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "( in principle , the two beds can coincide with each other in space . ) a transport agent ( e.g. , blood in living tissue ) `` flowing '' through this network delivers `` nutrients '' to the living medium and withdraws `` life activity '' products .",
    "the interaction between the transport agent and the living medium ( leading to the product exchange ) takes place when the transport agent `` flows '' through the last level branches of the supplying network ( in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] through the branches of level @xmath0 ) .",
    "the concentration of the life activity products will be regarded as the parameter characterizing the living medium state .",
    "this is due to the fact that the higher are life activities in intensity , the greater is the concentration of the resulting products .",
    "so an increase in this concentration informs the system that the living medium needs a greater amount of `` nutrients '' . in addition , the products resulting from the life activities and remaining in the living medium themselves can depress its functions . therefore the system has to prevent the concentration of these products exceeding a certain critical value .",
    "the motion of transport agent is accompanied by energy dissipation .",
    "so a certain external force should be applied to the system that affects the overall flow of transport agent ( for example , in living tissue this is the blood pressure @xcite ) .",
    "further distribution of the transport agent flow over the supplying network is governed by the individual properties of its branches .",
    "more precisely , the transport agent flow distribution is controlled by both a certain potential ( in living tissue it is the blood pressure ) and by the `` resistances '' of the branches to the transport agent flow . in order to specify the physical regularities of the transport agent flow distribution we may choose various approaches .",
    "one of them is prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production stated in nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another is related to swenson s principle of maximal dissipation . in our analysis",
    "the two approaches lead to the same result : the transport agent flows meet an extremum of a certain functional .",
    "so , to be defined we will adopt the minimum entropy production principle .",
    "for different elements of the living medium to fulfill their individual functions independently of one another the supplying network should , at least in the ideal case , have a capacity for controlling the state of the living medium at each its point .",
    "this requirement is reduced to the local control of the `` perfusion '' rate of the transport agent through the living medium .",
    "so the independence of the perfusion rate at one point from life activities of elements located at other points is a desirable property which will be referred below as to the perfect self - regulation .",
    "in fact , if we ignore diffusion in the living medium solely the perfusion rate of transport agent at a given point will govern functioning of elements at this point : supply them with `` nutrients '' and withdraw the life activity products .",
    "so the perfusion rate should take such a value that provides the optimal conditions for functioning of the elements , depending on their life activities .",
    "therefore if the perfusion rate at one point reacted substantially to the life activities at other points then the living medium elements would interfere with one another and the living system could lose its capacity for adapting .",
    "the existence of a great variety of living systems in nature enables us to think that such a nonlocal interaction is suppressed or , at least , depressed to a certain degree .",
    "however , in trying to describe how this self - regulation can be implemented , i.e. its particular mechanism we meet the following fundamental problem .",
    "the perfusion rate of the transport agent at a given point @xmath1 is certain to be determined by its flow through the corresponding last level branch @xmath2 of the supplying network ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . however , this flow in turn depends on the transport agent flow through the branch @xmath3 of the previous level connected with the branch @xmath4 and so on up to the stem @xmath5 ( the branch of zeroth level ) . in this way we find a path @xmath6 on the supplying network through which the transport agent flow reaches a small neighborhood of the point @xmath7",
    "let us consider the transport agent flow through one of these branches , for example , a branch @xmath8 of level @xmath9 ( in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] it is the branch @xmath10 ) .",
    "this branch supplies with `` nutrients '' not only elements in the vicinity of the point @xmath7 but also all of the elements located inside a certain domain @xmath11 ( inside the domain @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) and controls the living medium state in this domain as a whole .",
    "so the required flow of the transport agent through the branch @xmath13 is specified by the life activities of all the elements belonging to the domain @xmath14 and a change in the life activities of one of them inevitably will cause this flow to vary .",
    "since the external force applied to the system controls only the overall flow the specific distribution of the transport agent flow over the supplying network is governed by the `` resistances '' of all the branches . under such conditions , in general , a change in the transport agent flow through the branch @xmath15 ( for example , because of variations in its `` resistance '' ) causes the transport agent flow to alter in all the branches of higher levels that are connected with @xmath15 , in particular , in a last level branch @xmath16 leading to a point @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "so , in principle , a change in the life activities of elements near the point @xmath19 will lead via the branch @xmath15 to variations in the perfusion rate of transport agent at all the points belonging to the domain @xmath20 .",
    "since the domains @xmath21 increase in size and tend to the total space of the living medium as we pass on the supplying bed from the last level to its stem this effect is nonlocal substantially",
    ".    therefore special conditions are required for the self - regulation to be perfect because in the general case the perfusion rate of the transport agent is determined by the life activities of all the elements .    in other words for the perfect self - regulation to occur",
    "the `` resistances '' of all the branches should vary in a self - consistent way . in this place",
    "we actually meet the fundament problem mentioned above : what governs such variations of the branch `` resistances '' ? for a large living system it is unlikely that any one of its elements can possess the whole information required of governing the perfect response to changes in the environment and , so , in the life activities of living medium .",
    "this is due to the fact that such a control requires processing of a great amount of information characterizing the living medium state on all spatial scales ( i.e. at all the levels of supplying network ) . in particular , in living organisms local alterations in homeostasis seem to be controlled by regional mechanisms of self - regulation rather than the central nervous system @xcite .",
    "besides , none of these elements can individually control transport agent flow through the supplying network because of the mass conservation at its branching points .",
    "the aforementioned allows us to assume that the perfect self - regulation can be implemented through cooperative mechanisms . by this scenario each branch of the supplying network receives the corresponding small piece of the information on the living medium state and their reaction to this information gives rise to the desired redistribution of the transport agent flow over the supplying network . in other words , the branch `` resistances '' vary in such a self - consistent way that enables the supplying network to provide , for example , an additional amount of `` nutrients '' for the living medium elements which have a need for this and not to disturb transport agent flow at other points of the living medium .",
    "however , for the cooperative mechanism of perfect self - regulation to come into being , first , a certain self - processing of the information is required which enables the branches to react adequately , depending on their place in the supplying network .",
    "second , the physical properties of the supplying network should give rise to the cooperative effect of variations in the branch `` resistances '' on the transport agent flow redistribution leading to the desired results .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that these requirements can be fulfilled and so a cooperative mechanism of perfect self - regulation in living systems can exist .",
    "we will demonstrate that there is a required self - processing of information and the physics of transport agent motion ensures its proper redistribution over the supplying network .",
    "beforehand we can say that it is the mass conservation at the nodes of supplying network and its hierarchical organization those bring into being the information self - processing .",
    "this information self - processing is implemented through measuring the concentration of the life activity products inside each branch of the draining bed . due to the interaction with the living medium the transport agent saturates with the life activity products when it flows through the last level branches .",
    "then the transport agent moves through the draining bed from higher hierarchy levels to lower ones and , so , at the nodes its smaller streams unite into larger streams .",
    "therefore , due to the mass conservation the concentration @xmath22 of life activity products inside , for example , a branch @xmath23 is actually equal to the concentration of life activity products inside the living medium averaged over the domain @xmath24 which is drained as a whole by this branch .",
    "so the value of @xmath22 aggregates the information on the living medium state in the domain @xmath25 as a whole and , thus , can play the role of the information piece needed for this branch and the corresponding branch of the supplying bed to react properly to variations in the life activities of the living medium .",
    "the correspondence between the branches of the supplying and draining beds is illustratied in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] by the pair @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noted that developing this model we actually have kept in mind one of the possible mechanisms of self - regulation in living tissues .",
    "life activities of cellular tissue gives rise to variations in the carbon dioxide concentration in it and , so , in venous blood .",
    "receptors embedded into the vein walls through a regional nervous system govern the expansion or contraction of the corresponding arteries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    below , at first",
    ", we will analyze in detail the model for a living system with a regular supplying network .",
    "this network is organized in such a manner that the perfusion rate of transport agent be the same at every point of the living medium , all other factors being equal . in particular",
    ", we will develop a technique that not only enables us to study the perfect response of living system to changes in the living medium state but also can be used in investigations of its more complex behavior .",
    "then we will show that the perfect self - regulation can also occur in living systems with nonregular supplying networks of the general form .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of a living medium @xmath28 and a hierarchical supplying network @xmath29 similar to that shown in fig .",
    "the network @xmath29 involves supplying @xmath30 and draining @xmath31 beds of the tree form ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] by the left and right  hand side parts ) and an external element @xmath32 joining the tree stems .",
    "transport agent flowing through the former bed supplies the living medium @xmath28 with `` nutrients '' . at the same time transport agent",
    "withdraws life activity products from the living medium through the draining bed . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the living medium domain @xmath28 is a @xmath33-dimensional cube of edge @xmath34 and the geometry of both the beds is the same .",
    "the supplying and draining beds can be represented as the collections of groups of branches @xmath35 belonging to one level : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . below we will use the symbol @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 or @xmath41 where it does not lead to misunderstanding or gives the same results due to the mirror symmetry of the supplying and draining beds . in these terms",
    "the embedding of the supplying network @xmath42 ( as the collection of branches @xmath35 ) into the living medium matches the partition of the domain @xmath28 into the following collection of cubes @xmath43 .    for each level",
    "@xmath44 the group @xmath45 involves @xmath46 equal disjoint cubes of edge @xmath47 that together compose the whole living medium domain :    @xmath48    for any two levels @xmath44 and @xmath49 each domain @xmath50 belongs to one of the domains of the group @xmath51 and , thus , each domain @xmath52 can be represented as a certain union of the domains of group @xmath53    @xmath54    for zeroth level @xmath55 . below the cubes of the group @xmath56",
    "will be also called fundamental domains of level @xmath44 and those of the last level @xmath0 will be also referred to as elementary domains .    the supplying and draining beds are embedded into the living medium in such a way that every branch @xmath23 of a given level @xmath44 supplies ( or drains ) a certain domain @xmath57 as a whole .",
    "each elementary domain is bound up with one of the last level branches .",
    "the last level number @xmath0 is assumed to be much larger than unity : @xmath58 , and the length @xmath59 may be regarded as an infinitely small spatial scale .",
    "transport agent flow is directed from lower to higher levels on the supplying bed and in the opposite direction on the draining bed .",
    "since the geometry of both the beds is assumed to be the same , we specify it for the supplying bed only .",
    "the stem of this bed ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) goes into the cube @xmath28 through one of its corners and reaches the cube center @xmath60 , where it splits into @xmath61 branches of the first level .",
    "each branch of the first level reaches a center @xmath62 of one of the @xmath63 fundamental domains of the first level . at the centers",
    "@xmath64 each of the first level branches in turn splits into @xmath63 second level branches .",
    "then this process is continued in a similar way up to level @xmath0 .",
    "the branches of the last level @xmath65 are directly connected with living medium @xmath28 .",
    "it should be noted that in this model the length @xmath66 of branches belonging to level @xmath44 is estimated by the expression @xmath67 and smaller is a branch , to a higher level belongs it .",
    "transport agent does not interact with the living medium @xmath28 during its motion through the branches except for the last level ones .",
    "when the transport agent reaches one of the last level branches of the supplying bed , for example , branch @xmath68 the `` nutritious '' products carried with it uniformly spread over the elementary domain @xmath69 containing the branch @xmath68 . at the same time transport agent",
    "is saturated with the life activity products , withdrawing them from the domain @xmath69 . in this way",
    "the life activity products going with the transport agent through the draining bed leave the system .",
    "the state of the medium @xmath28 is described by a certain field @xmath70 being the dimensionless concentration of life activity products .",
    "dynamics of the field @xmath71 is governed by the volumetric generation @xmath72 resulting from the life activities , the dissipation because of draining the living medium , and the diffusion .",
    "in other words the field @xmath73 is considered to evolve according to the equation    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the diffusivity and @xmath76 is the perfusion rate of transport agent .",
    "since a branch @xmath68 of the last level supplies the elementary domain @xmath69 of the living medium as a whole the transport agent flow @xmath77 through the branch @xmath68 and the perfusion rate @xmath76 are related by the expression    @xmath78    the distribution of the transport agent flow @xmath79 over the network @xmath42 obeys the mass conservation at its nodes @xmath80    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the transport agent flow through a branch @xmath23 going in or out of the node @xmath83 and the sums run over all the branches @xmath84 leading from or to this node for the supplying and draining beds , respectively . provided the field @xmath76 is given expressions  ( [ * 2.2 ] ) and ( [ * 2.4 ] ) completely specify the quantities @xmath79 .",
    "the last term in equation ( [ * 2.1 ] ) implies that the transport agent when going through the branch @xmath68 is saturated with the life activity products up to their concentration in the elementary domain @xmath69 .",
    "then these products moves with the transport agent through the draining bed without exchange with the living medium .",
    "therefore , we also ascribe to the transport agent going through the draining bed the collection of variables @xmath85 measuring the concentration of the life activity products inside the branches @xmath86 and regard the value @xmath87 as the flow of these products in the branch @xmath23 . for a branch @xmath68 of the last level we write    @xmath88    and assuming the conservation of the life activity products at the nodes of the draining bed we get    @xmath89    equation ( [ * 2.1 ] ) among with expressions ( [ * 2.2 ] ) and ( [ * 2.3 ] ) describe the dynamics of the state of the the living medium and its interaction with transport agent . equations ( [ * 2.4 ] ) and ( [ * 2.5 ] ) reflect the general laws of transport phenomena in the supplying and draining beds .",
    "let us , now , specify the regularities governing the transport agent flow through the network @xmath29 .",
    "first , provided the characteristic parameters of branches are fixed the transport agent flow patter @xmath79 is assumed to meet the minimum condition of the total energy dissipation due to transport agent motion :    @xmath90    subject to relationships ( [ * 2.4 ] ) , where the total rate of energy dissipation is given by the expression    @xmath91    here @xmath92 is the kinetic coefficient characterizing the energy dissipation during the motion of transport agent through the branch @xmath23 , @xmath93 is the external force causing the transport agent motion through the network @xmath29 as a whole , @xmath94 is the transport agent flow through the tree stems , and the sum runs over all the branches of the network @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that previously by the term `` branch resistances '' we have exactly meant the given kinetic coefficients because they do play the role of the true branch resistances to transport agent flow as it will be shown below in the next section .",
    "second , in this model it is the coefficients @xmath95 those characterize the individual effect of the branches on the transport agent flow .",
    "so the system response to changes in the living medium state , namely , to variations in the field @xmath71 ( see introduction ) is represented as time variations of the coefficients @xmath95 .",
    "since the supplying and draining beds have been assumed to be equivalent in architectonics the flow pattern on these beds @xmath79 as well as the coefficient collection @xmath95 are set to be the mirror images of each other within reversing the flow direction .",
    "the latter allows us to confine our description of the system response to the draining bed .",
    "as mentioned in introduction the pattern @xmath96 can be treated as the aggregated information on the living medium state on all the spatial scales . in particular",
    ", the variable @xmath22 corresponding to the branch @xmath97 characterizes the state of the living medium in the fundamental domain @xmath98 as a whole .",
    "therefore we assume that for each branch , for example , a branch @xmath23 of level @xmath44 time variations in the coefficient @xmath92 are directly controlled by the variable @xmath22 assigned to this branch . under the steady - state conditions",
    "this means that the coefficient @xmath92 is an explicit function of the variable @xmath22 identical for all the branches of one level @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath99 .",
    "the general properties of the @xmath100 dependence are actually determined by the fact that the transport agent flow through the network @xmath29 should grow as the variables @xmath96 increase .",
    "indeed , let changes in the environment cause the life activities of the living medium to grow in intensity .",
    "the latter leads immediately to an increase in the concentration @xmath101 of life activity products inside the living medium , causing an increase in the variables @xmath96 .",
    "the higher is the life activity intensity , the greater is the amount of `` nutrients '' needed for the living medium .",
    "therefore , under such conditions the transport agent flow through the network @xmath29 must increase too .",
    "in other words , an increase in the variables @xmath96 should give rise to an increase of transport agent flow . the less is the coefficient @xmath92 , the greater is the transport agent flow that can go through the branch @xmath23 , all other factors being equal .",
    "thus , the function @xmath100 must be decreasing with respect to the variable @xmath102 .",
    "in addition , there should be a certain critical concentration @xmath103 of the life activity products showing the upper boundary of the vital interval for the field @xmath101 , i.e. the maximum of the allowable concentration of the life activity products in the living medium .",
    "the system has to prevent the field @xmath71 exceeding the value @xmath103 as much as it can .",
    "otherwise , the system can lose the capability for adapting .",
    "in particular , if the field @xmath104 reaches the boundary of the vital interval at all the points of the living medium and , consequently , all the variables @xmath96 come close to the critical value @xmath103 ( as it follows from ( [ * 2.4])([*2.5 ] ) ) all the branches should exhaust their capability for decreasing the coefficients @xmath95 .    taking the aforesaid into account we represent",
    "the @xmath100 dependence in terms of    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is a constant equal to @xmath100 at @xmath107 and @xmath108 is a certain universal function of @xmath109 .",
    "the characteristic form of the @xmath110  dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3]a .",
    "for the transport network @xmath29 to be able to react properly to local variations in the life activities the transport agent flow should be governed by branches of all the levels . as will be seen below this condition",
    "allows us to represent the dependence of the value @xmath106 on the level number @xmath44 in the form    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is a certain constant and @xmath113 is a smooth function of @xmath44 such that @xmath114 and formally @xmath115 as @xmath116 .    concluding the description of the system response we also take into account a possible time delay of the branch response to variations in the variables @xmath85 and represent the evolution equation for the kinetic coefficient @xmath92 of branch @xmath23 belonging to level @xmath44 as    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the time delay depending solely on the level number @xmath44 .",
    "this form of equation  ( [ * 2.9 ] ) enables us to regard the term @xmath119 as a dimensionless signal generated by receptors imbedded into the branch @xmath23 . as follows from ( [ *",
    "2.7 ] ) and ( [ * 2.9 ] ) the functions @xmath120 and @xmath110 are related by the expression    @xmath121f[\\phi ( x)]=x.\\ ] ]    the behavior of the function @xmath122 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f3]b .    in the context of the stated model the problem of self - regulation",
    "is reduced to finding an expression relating the perfusion rate @xmath123 of the transport agent to the field @xmath101 :    @xmath124    in general , this expression is of the functional form , i.e. is nonlocal in space and only under specific conditions can relate the fields @xmath125 , @xmath71 taken at the same point @xmath7 .",
    "in what follows we will find this conditions and obtain the corresponding particular form of expression  ( [ phi ] )",
    "by virtue of the adopted assumptions the size @xmath59 of the elementary domains plays the role of an infinitesimal length",
    ". therefore expression  ( [ * 2.2 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath126    where the symbol @xmath127 stands for the characteristic function of the fundamental domain @xmath128 , i.e.    @xmath129    and the sum runs over all the branches of the last level . if we find expressions relating the pattern @xmath79 to the fields @xmath130 , @xmath76 then formula  ( [ e3.1 ] ) will immediately give us the specific form of  ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "so in the present section we solve the equations stated above with respect to the variables @xmath79 regarding the field @xmath131 ( and may be the field @xmath76 ) as fixed .",
    "let us , first , find the extremal equations for functional ( [ * 2.6 ] ) .",
    "following the lagrange multiplier method we reduce the extremum problem for functional ( [ * 2.6 ] ) subject to conditions ( [ * 2.4 ] ) to finding the extremal equations of the following functional    @xmath132 + \\sum_{{\\mathfrak b}}p_{{\\mathfrak b}}\\left [ \\sum_{i\\in { \\mathfrak b}}^ { \\mathrm{in}}j_i-\\sum_{i\\in { \\mathfrak b}}^{\\mathrm{out}}j_i\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath133 are the lagrange multipliers ascribed to the nodes @xmath134 of the network @xmath29 , the sum @xmath135 runs over all the nodes @xmath136 , and the symbols @xmath137 , @xmath138 stand for the sum over all the branches going in or out of the given node @xmath83 .",
    "( the direction of the motion on the network @xmath29 is chosen so to coincide with the direction of transport agent flow . ) from the conditions @xmath139 we obtain the desired extremals    @xmath140    and @xmath141 here the multipliers @xmath142 , @xmath143 correspond to the entrance and the exit of the given branch @xmath23 and @xmath144 , @xmath145 are the multipliers ascribed to the entrance and the exit of the transport network .",
    "it should be noted that equations  ( [ * 3.2 ] ) and ( [ * 3.3 ] ) together with equations  ( [ * 2.4 ] ) actually make up the system of kirchhoff s equations for the network @xmath29 . in these equations the variables",
    "@xmath133 play the role of potentials at the nodes @xmath80 causing the transport agent flow through the corresponding branches and the kinetic coefficients @xmath95 may be regarded as the branch resistances .      at the next step",
    "we should solve the system of kirchhoff s equations  ( [ * 2.4 ] ) , ( [ * 3.2 ] ) , ( [ * 3.3 ] ) .",
    "however , when the field @xmath71 is nonuniform , the resistances @xmath95 of all the branches can differ in magnitude because of the network response . in this case solving kirchhoff s equations directly is troublesome . in order to avoid this problem",
    "we make use of the following trick .",

    "under these conditions we can rewrite equation  ( [ * 10.10 ] ) as    @xmath201    where we have also taken into account relation  ( [ * 50.2 ] ) . then acting by the operator @xmath202 @xmath203 on equation  ( [ * 50.9 ] ) and using ( [ * 11.1 ] ) we reduce it to the following    @xmath204    here @xmath205 is the perfusion rate of transport agent through the living medium containing no life activity products , @xmath206 .",

    "then acting by the operator @xmath217 on equation  ( [ * 11.3 ] ) and taking into account identity  ( [ a2.av3 ] ) we convert it to the same form within the replacement    @xmath218 the latter , however , enables us to make use of identity  ( [ i d ] ) and to reduce ( [ * 11.3 ] ) to    @xmath219    whence it immediately follows that    @xmath220    because the fields @xmath71 , @xmath76 are practically constant on scales of order @xmath214 .",

    "the local form of equation  ( [ psr ] ) demonstrates that under the given conditions the perfusion rate @xmath76 is determined by variations in the field @xmath71 at the same point only .",
    "thus , the cooperative response of all the branches is so self - consistent that the supplying network delivers `` nutrients '' only to the living medium points that  ask  for this . in this case",
    "no unexpected changes in the `` nutrient '' delivery interfering with the living medium activities occur , i.e. the supplying network functions perfectly .",
    "another characteristics of perfect self - regulation is the fact that the field @xmath71 can not go beyond the vital interval @xmath223 $ ] for a long time .",
    "this is due to an unbounded increase in the perfusion rate @xmath76 that occurs when the field @xmath71 locally exceeds the value @xmath103 ( see equation  ( [ psr ] ) ) .",
    "typical dynamics of the fields @xmath71 , @xmath76 demonstrating such behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] for the one - dimensional living medium .    concluding this subsection we remind that when deriving equation  ( [ psr ] ) we have used the inequality @xmath224 without justification .",
    "its validity can be shown in the following way .",
    "let us consider the potential drop @xmath225 across a branch @xmath23 which according to ( [ * 10.9 ] ) is equal to @xmath226 . then taking into account ( [ * 50.1 ] ) , ( [ * 11.1 ] ) , and ( [ psr ] ) we get    @xmath227    the right - hand side of this equation is a constant independent of variations in the living medium state .",
    "at the initial time the field @xmath228 and so @xmath229 , thus @xmath230 should be positive at any time moment later .    besides , equation  ( [ jus ] ) demonstrates one more characteristic property of the perfect self - regulation .",
    "under the given conditions the potential distribution over the supplying network does not depend on variations in the living medium state .",
    "exactly this independence ensures that the transport agent flow @xmath82 through a last level branch @xmath155 will remain unchanged if the state of the living medium inside the corresponding elementary domain @xmath231 does not alter .",
    "in fact , for this branch the value @xmath22 @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) , so , the `` resistivity '' @xmath234 of branch @xmath23 will be also constant under such conditions .",
    "consequently , the transport agent flow @xmath235 as well as the perfusion rate @xmath236 in this domain will be independent of the living medium state at other points .",
    "in other words , it is the constancy of the potential distribution that ensures the perfusion rate @xmath76 being controlled by the living medium state at the same point .",
    "in the previous sections we have considered the supplying network whose architectonics and embedding into the living medium are specified by @xmath63-fold spliting of branches with @xmath61 , where @xmath33 is the living medium dimension . however , looking attentively through the previous analysis we see that it has been used , in fact , only the following properties of the supplying network architectonics . each branch @xmath23 supplies ( or drains ) as a whole a certain domain @xmath237 and all the branches of smaller length and connected with the branch @xmath23 supply ( or drain ) subdomains of the domain @xmath237 .",
    "the whole collection @xmath238 of the domains corresponding to branches @xmath239 of the same level @xmath240 compose together the living medim @xmath241 and are mutually disjoint ( see ( [ em1 ] ) ) .",
    "besides , if @xmath242 is the whole collection of branches of level @xmath44 that are formed by splitting of the branch @xmath160 ( of level @xmath243 ) then all the fundamental domains @xmath244 together make up the domain @xmath245 ( see ( [ em2 ] ) )",
    ". none of the other properties has been used .    in particular , the factor @xmath63 is not resticted by the value of @xmath246 .",
    "therefore the obtained results hold for any other implementation of the architectonics of the supplying network and its embedding into the living medium that meets conditioins  ( [ em1 ] ) , ( [ em2 ] ) .",
    "for example , dichotomic supplying networks demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] obey these conditions .      in the previous sections",
    "we have analyzed the self - regulation problem assuming the supplying network regular in architectonics and involving a large number of levelvs .",
    "so it could give the impression that these assumptions are the necessary conditions for self - regulation to be perfect .",
    "therefore in the present section we demonstrate that the perfect self - regulation can occur in systems with supplying networks of arbitrary architectonics , at least , when the transient processes are ignorable .    as before we consider a supplying network consisting of supplying and draining beds which are mirror image of each other and connected through terminal branches ( fig .",
    "the transport agent does not interact with the living medium until it reaches the terminal branches where the transport agent and the living medium exchange `` nutrients '' and life activity products . then during motion through the draining bed the transport agent does not interact with the living medium again .",
    "transport agent flow is assumed to be governed by the same regularities as stated in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "so for each node @xmath247 of the draining bed ( fig .",
    "[ f7]a ) we can write the following conservation laws    @xmath248    where the sums @xmath249 and @xmath250 run over all the branches @xmath251 leading to or from this node , @xmath82 and @xmath22 are the transport agent flow and the concentration of life activity products in the branche @xmath23 going in or out of the node @xmath247 . besides , for all the branches going out of one node @xmath252 the concentration @xmath253 of life activity products is assumed to be the same .",
    "the branch orientation is chosen according to the direction of the transport agent motion .",
    "the potential distribution @xmath254 over the draining bed nodes and the patten @xmath79 of transport agent flow are related by the expressions    @xmath255    where @xmath256 and @xmath257 are the potentials ascribed to the terminal nodes @xmath258 and @xmath259 of the branch @xmath23 as shown in fig .",
    "the dependence of the `` resistance '' @xmath234 of the branch @xmath23 on the value @xmath22 describes the living system response to variations in the living medium state . in the present section",
    "we analyze only the case corresponding to the perfect self - regulation which is characterized by the relationship ( cf .",
    "( [ * 2.9 ] ) )    @xmath260    where @xmath261 is the `` resistance '' of the branch @xmath23 at @xmath262 . for the terminal branches @xmath263 of the draining bed the quantities @xmath264",
    "are directly specified by the living medim state and , so , may be treated as predetermined when analyzing the distribution of transport agent flow over the draining bed . besides , due to the mirror symmetry of the supplying and draining beds , we can regard the potential @xmath265 at the exit node of the draining bed ( the latter node of the draining bed stem ) and the potential @xmath266 at all the entrance nodes ( the former nodes of the terminal branches ) as fixed values .    in order to show that under such condition the supplying network response is perfect it is sufficient to demonstrate that the potential distribution over the draining bed nodes is constant , i.e. does not depends on variations in the field @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , in this case the perfusion rate @xmath221 of transport agent inside a domain @xmath267 drained as a whole by the terminal branch @xmath268 is    @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the volume of the domain @xmath271 .",
    "whence it follows that the perfusion rate @xmath76 is practically controlled by the field @xmath130 taken at the same point @xmath272 because the value of @xmath273 is determined directly by the value of the field @xmath130 in the domain @xmath274 .",
    "let us fix a potential distribution @xmath275 that occurs at initial time .",
    "in general the system of kirchhoff s equations  ( [ irr1 ] ) , ( [ irr2 ] ) should have a single solution .",
    "so to prove the independece of the potential distribution @xmath254 from variations in the field @xmath276 we may to show that this system possesses a solution provided we have fixed @xmath277 .",
    "let us consider the system of equations  ( [ irr1 ] ) , ( [ irr2 ] ) for an arbitrary node @xmath247 ( fig .",
    "[ f7]a ) which is formed by @xmath278 branches going into it and @xmath279 branches leaving this node . at first",
    ", we will treat the values @xmath280 ascribed to the branches going into the node @xmath247 as given quantities .",
    "then the variables to be found by solving this system are as follows : @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 ( the subsripts @xmath284 and @xmath285 mean that the corresponding quatities relate to the branches going into or out of the node @xmath247 ) .",
    "the total number of these quantities is equal to @xmath286 , whereas the total number of the given equations is @xmath287 . therefore this system seems to be overdetermined .",
    "in fact , however , equations  ( [ irr1 ] ) , ( [ irr2 ] ) are linearly dependent .",
    "to justify this statement , we , first , note that under the steady - state conditions none of the quantities @xmath96 can exceed the value @xmath288 .",
    "indeed , according to ( [ irr1 ] ) , for any node @xmath247 the value of @xmath289 .",
    "so for a branch @xmath23 the value of @xmath22 might exceed @xmath103 only if there were a path @xmath290 on the draining bed leading from the branch @xmath23 to one of the terminal branches such that for all braches @xmath291 belonging to it the values @xmath292 . in this case , as follows from ( [ irr2 ] ) and ( [ irr3 ] ) , the total `` resistance '' of the path @xmath290 were equal to zero .",
    "so the potential @xmath257 at the node @xmath293 into which the branch@xmath23 goes would coinside with the potential at the draining bed entrance , @xmath257 @xmath294 @xmath295 .",
    "in addition , the total transport agent flow @xmath296 going through the node @xmath293 would be equal to the transport agent flow along the path @xmath290 except for cases when there are another similar paths @xmath297 .",
    "this in turn would cause the value of @xmath298 to become greater than ( or equal to ) @xmath103 and so on . in this way",
    "we would reach the stem of the draining bed and obtain that the potential @xmath265 at the exit of the draining bed has to be equal to the portential @xmath299 at its entrance .",
    "thus all the values @xmath22 do not exceed @xmath103 .    then let us sum equations ( [ irr2 ] ) with the wight @xmath300 over all branches relating to the node @xmath247 . in this way taking into account ( [ irr1 ] ) and ( [ irr3 ] ) we get    @xmath301    since the initial portential distribution @xmath302 has been established by the existing transport agent flow this equality is fulfilled .",
    "so equations  ( [ irr1 ] ) , ( [ irr2 ] ) are linearly dependent and can be reduced to a system of @xmath303 equations which is not overdetermined and possesses a solution .    above we have regarded the quantities @xmath96 as given beforehand .",
    "if a node @xmath247 is one of the latter nodes of the terminal branches this is justified because the values @xmath304 at such branches are directly determined by the living medium state .",
    "then , sovling the system of equations  ( [ irr1])([irr2 ] ) for these nodes we find the values @xmath305 which form the collection of quatities @xmath306 for nodes of lower levels . repeating this proceedures we get the draining bed stem .",
    "in this way we get the conclusion that there is a solution of the full set of equation  ( [ irr1])([irr2 ] ) for a fixed potential distribution @xmath307 when the state of the living medium varies in time .",
    "the latter demonstrates that under the adopted assumptions the response of the supplying network is perfect .",
    "the fact that equation  ( [ psr ] ) governing the dynamics of transport agent perfusion can be of such a simple form is a surprise because it does not directly contain any information on the complex architectonics of the supplying network .",
    "this fact is actually one of the main results obtained in the present paper .",
    "so we , now , discuss the qualitative physical essence of haw the perfect regulation can occur .",
    "let us assume that in a small domain @xmath308 ( fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) the field @xmath70 increases and comes close to the boundary @xmath103 of the vital interval . in order to smother this dangerous growth",
    "the system should increase the perfusion rate @xmath172 in the domain @xmath308 .",
    "for this purpose all the `` resistances '' @xmath309 along the path @xmath310 connecting the stems of the supplying and draining beds and going through the domain @xmath308 have to decrease substantially . as a result",
    ", the transport agent flow along the path @xmath311 and , consequently , the perfusion rate in the domain @xmath308 will grow .",
    "higher values of the variables @xmath312 along the path @xmath311 ( on the draining bed ) bear the information required of such a response .",
    "variations in the field @xmath71 located in the domain @xmath308 can , in principle , give rise to alterations of the perfusion rate at points external to the domain @xmath308 because of variations in the transport agent flow through large branches .",
    "however there is a difference between the external and internal points of the domain @xmath308 from the standpoint of this transport agent flow redistribution . for an external point @xmath313 on the path @xmath311",
    "there are two nodes @xmath314 and @xmath315 belonging to the supplying and draining beds , respectively , at which a similar path @xmath316 leading to the given point @xmath7 , at first , diverges from the path @xmath311 and , then , they converge ( fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) . due to the mirror symmetry of the two beds we can confine our consideration to the supplying bed only .",
    "the node @xmath317 divides the path @xmath318 on this bed into two parts .",
    "one of them leads from the stem to the node @xmath319 and coincides with the path @xmath320 .",
    "the other goes from the node @xmath314 to the domain @xmath308 and does not belong to the path @xmath316 .",
    "therefore , on one hand , decrease in the `` resistances '' of the branches forming the former part tends to increase the transport agent flow along the path @xmath311 and , thus , through small branches of the path @xmath316 that directly control the perfusion rate in the vicinity of the point @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , the less are the `` resistances '' of the branches making up the latter part of the path @xmath311 , the larger is the fraction of transport agent flow that is directed along the path @xmath311 at the node @xmath321 .",
    "these effects are opposite in sign with respect to increase in the perfusion rate at the point @xmath7 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] and can compensate each other . in the present paper",
    "we have actually found the conditions of such compensation .",
    "in the present paper we have shown that there is a specific cooperative mechanism of self - regulation by which a living system can respond perfectly to changes in the environment , i.e. react without interference with itself .",
    "this mechanism is based on the corresponding self - processing of information and the cooperative effect caused by individual response of the supplying network elements . the existence of large hierarchical systems in nature and their capability for adapting to changes in the environment points to the fact that they should function perfectly , at least , at first approximation .",
    "for example , in living tissue in order to reduce effects of nonideality arterial and venous beds contain a system of anastomoses , i.e. vessels joining arteries or veins of the same level @xcite .",
    "in other words , the vascular network is organized in such a manner that its function be as perfect as possible .",
