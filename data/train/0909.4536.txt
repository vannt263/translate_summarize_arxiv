    "lbgs at @xmath1 are faint ( @xmath5 corresponds to m@xmath6 at @xmath1 ) and require long integrations using 8 m class telescopes to obtain spectral information having a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a few .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath7 @xmath1 spectra have been obtained and studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "ly@xmath0 is the most prominent feature in lbg spectra and has been shown to be indicative of other spectral properties , such as interstellar medium absorption line strength and continuum profile ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter aes03 )",
    ".    inspection of the spectroscopic samples gathered to date show that @xmath8% of lbgs exhibit dominant ( or net ) ly@xmath0 in absorption , with the remaining exhibiting dominant ly@xmath0 in emission ( e.g. , aes03 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a recent investigation of close and interacting pairs @xcite finds evidence of an overabundance of @xmath1 lbgs exhibiting ly@xmath0 emission in close pairs ; all lbgs with projected physical separations @xmath9 @xmath10kpc display ly@xmath0 in emission . to properly explore this relationship , along with other spectroscopic trends with spatial distribution , large samples that reflect the spectral properties of lbgs are necessary .",
    "however , the conventional means of multi - object spectroscopy is inefficient in acquiring the spectra of galaxies closely spaced on the sky because of inherent mechanical constraints ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , comprehensive lbg spectroscopic surveys are difficult and time intensive .    high - redshift star - forming systems with continua typically too faint for spectroscopic follow - up , but with prominent ly@xmath0 emission @xcite , have been detected via targeted spectroscopic and narrowband surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the faint continua of these ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) , and the difficulties involved in their acquisition , lae surveys have been limited to narrow redshift ranges and typically clustered fields . as a result , fewer total spectra have been compiled relative to lbgs , with the details of the process , or processes , that contribute to the generation and escape of ly@xmath0 emission , less certain . in addition",
    ", the data - gathering techniques have provided only a few cases to date where the mass of laes from clustering can be reasonably inferred @xcite .",
    "lbgs at @xmath1 that are dominated by ly@xmath0 in absorption separate sufficiently in color  magnitude space from those dominated by ly@xmath0 in emission to enable a simple means using broadband imaging to isolate subsets with desired ly@xmath0 features and associated spectral properties .",

    "we describe the observations used in this work in section  [ data ] . in section",

    "as a key component to this work , we use the ly@xmath0 ew measurements of aes03 for @xmath14 lbg spectra of the ccs03 sample ( a. e. shapley , 2009 , private communication ) .    in section  [ test ] , we test the criteria presented below using the spectra of @xmath2 @xmath15-selected @xmath1 lbgs in the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) deep field `` d4 .

    "motivated by the results of @xcite , we overlay the spectroscopically confirmed lbgs and code them by their aes03 defined ly@xmath0 ew quartiles .",
    "aes03 find that lbgs with strong ly@xmath0 have blue @xmath38  continua with a continuous reddening trend seen with decreasing ly@xmath0 emission ew , through to strong absorption .",
    "this is the main cause of the color separation on the cmd in figure  [ color ] .",
    "the presence of the ly@xmath0 feature in the @xmath39 band also contributes to the color separation , but to a lesser extent , and is on order of the @xmath40 mag uncertainties .",
    "we use the term `` albgs '' for lbgs with dominant ly@xmath0 in absorption ( net ly@xmath0 ew @xmath41 ) and `` elbgs '' for dominant ly@xmath0 in emission ( net ly@xmath0 ew @xmath42 ) .",
    "we find that the albg and elbg distributions show significant overlap but are distinct populations",

    "s test of the albg and elbg ( @xmath43 ) distributions produces a probability of @xmath44 that the two distributions are pulled from the same population .",
    "similarly , a k  s test produces @xmath45 for the @xmath20 mag distributions .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panels of figure  [ color ] .",
    "next , we study two lbg spectral subsets that exhibit the opposite extremes in ly@xmath0 ew behavior .",
    "subset 1 contains the @xmath46 strongest albgs ( net ly@xmath0 ew @xmath47 ) and subset 2 consists of the @xmath46 strongest elbgs ( net ew @xmath48 ) of the full spectroscopic sample .",
    "the ( @xmath43 ) versus @xmath20 cmd of the two subsets is plotted in figure  [ 1and4 ] and shows two cohesive distributions with a more distinct separation when compared to the albg / elbg distribution values shown in figure  [ color ] . using the statistical mean values of the two subsets , we sever the populations in both color and magnitude as shown by the solid line in figure  [ 1and4 ] .",
    "this line falls @xmath49 from both the color and magnitude mean values of both distributions and defines our primary cut .",
    "we show that more restrictive selections based on the slope of this cut ( defined below ) , are very effective in isolating lbg spectral types with differing ly@xmath0 and continuum profiles .",
    "we use the parameters of the subset 1 and 2 distributions to refine the primary cut in an effort to generate pure samples of each spectral type .",
    "choosing cmd cuts that are separated from the primary cut by @xmath50 of the ( @xmath43 ) distributions of each subset and along the same slope as the primary cut , selects lbg spectral types @xmath51 from the mean values of the opposite distribution .",
    "we find that the following criteria select nearly pure samples of albgs : @xmath52    and elbgs @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 and are the @xmath56 standard deviations of the ( @xmath43 ) distributions for subset 1 and subset 2 , respectively .",
    "these selection cuts are indicated in figure  [ 1and4 ] .    applying equations  [ albg ] and  [ elbg ] to the full spectroscopic data set of ccs03 produces spectral - type samples consisting of @xmath57 albgs and @xmath58 elbgs with contamination fractions of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ( figure  [ cuthist ] ; top panel ) .",
    "in addition , figure  [ cuthist ] presents the net ly@xmath0 ew and redshift distributions for the two isolated samples ( center and bottom panels , respectively ) . the samples exhibit @xmath61   ew for the elbgs and @xmath62   ew for the albgs and their redshift distributions are found to be representative of the full data set ( @xmath63 = @xmath64 , @xmath65 = @xmath66 , and @xmath67 = @xmath68 ) . the above criteria , of course , can be made more strict by using a larger coefficient of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , thereby producing samples that are more pure , at the cost of sample size . in this manner",
    ", large photometric data sets can obtain very clean spectral - type samples while still maintaining a large number of objects for good statistics .",
    "laes at @xmath1 have colors similar to elbgs with the bulk expected to have ( @xmath36 ) @xmath71 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) .",
    "the colors and mass of laes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appear to provide a natural extension of the lbg population and would help to complete the @xmath20@xmath72 elbg magnitude truncation .    from the albg / elbg color and magnitude distributions and those of their spectral subsets , and the results of the spectral - type selection criteria above , we find that a pure sample of laes ( defined here as having @xmath20 @xmath73 ) can be obtained using @xmath74    which modifies the elbg cut to a larger separation from the primary cut .",
    "this effectively avoids systems displaying ly@xmath0 in absorption by selecting objects @xmath75 from the mean of the albg distribution .",
    "the region of the cmd defined by equation  [ lae ] is indicated in figure  [ 1and4 ] and shows that the few spectroscopically identified objects in the ccs03 sample that meet these criteria exhibit ly@xmath0 in emission .",
    "similar to above , the purity of the lae sample can be determined by the @xmath70 coefficient .",
    "we use @xmath76 @xmath15-selected @xmath1 lbgs in the cfhtls deep field `` d4 '' to test the predictions of the spectral - type criteria and our lae assumptions .",
    "figure  [ cfht ] plots the ( @xmath77 ) versus @xmath78 mag cmd for the `` d4 '' field and shows our tentative spectral - type cuts based on the @xmath79 @xmath1 lbg densities and the results of the above analysis .",
    "the primary cut shown here produces albg / elbg samples with a very similar @xmath80 ratio ( @xmath81 ) as compared to the @xmath20 ratio of ccs03 when maintaining conventional color - selection criteria , and specifically the constraint ( @xmath82 ) @xmath83 . for more complete color - space detection ,",
    "we relax the criterion to ( @xmath84 ) @xmath85 to include the small number of bluer objects to probe the full elbg and expected lae ( @xmath82 ) distribution .",
    "the relaxation of the color in this manner does not increase the fraction of interlopers ( e.g. , ccs03 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the `` d4 '' field is reflective of the remaining three cfhtls deep fields in depth and generates spectral - type samples of @xmath86 albgs and @xmath87 elbgs , @xmath88 of which fall in the lae selection region ( lae magnitude definition shown in figure  [ cfht ] is @xmath89 ) .    [",
    "0.35 ]    the analysis of our @xmath2 spectra ( section  [ data ] ) indicates that our tentative spectral - type cuts are very effective . of the @xmath90 lbgs targeted in the albg spectral - type cut , eight have confirmed ly@xmath0 in absorption , two show complex absorption and emission profiles with net ly@xmath0 emission , and one is unidentified as a result of its low s / n .",
    "nine of the 17 lbgs targeted in the elbg region were unidentified ( although six show weak evidence of emission ) , with eight exhibiting ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "seven of the eight galaxies that fall in the lae region show ly@xmath0 emission , with the remaining galaxy being unidentified .",
    "this demonstrates a high efficiency in identifying @xmath91 laes from their broadband colors and helps to confirm the lae extension to the lbg population .",

    "the relationships between ly@xmath0 ew and ( @xmath43 ) and ly@xmath0 ew and @xmath20 mag enable a spectral separation of the lbg population using broadband data .",
    "we define statistical photometric cuts to reliably generate @xmath92% pure spectral - type samples of lbgs displaying dominant ly@xmath0 in absorption and dominant ly@xmath0 in emission .",
    "in addition , the spectral - type broadband criteria are extended to isolate clean samples of laes .",
    "our spectroscopic sample of @xmath2 @xmath1 lbgs from the cfhtls demonstrates the efficiency of the broadband criteria presented here in identifying galaxies based on their ly@xmath0 feature , including laes .",
    "use of this method will allow the statistical study of @xmath1 galaxies populations from the large numbers easily acquired in deep broadband surveys .",
    "this circumvents the expense and constraints of investigations using mos spectroscopy and the limitations of narrowband searches .",
