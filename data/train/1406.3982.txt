    "the physics behind these phenomena is governed by the strong spin - spin interaction along the 1d direction , together with a much weaker coupling along the other directions .",
    "further , it is well known that an ideal 1d af spin system does not show long - range ordering ( lro ) above @xmath4  k due to strong quantum spin fluctuation , causing a series of unconventional phenomena .",
    "also q1d metals have been in the center of attention for scientists worldwide since decades @xcite , due to their tendency toward fermi surface instabilities , @xmath5 density waves , and for their ability to form non - fermi - liquid ground states . at present day",

    "this compound is very interesting since it is something as unusual as a q1d metallic antiferromagnet .",

    "the sodium ions are located `` in the centre '' of such channels and are thought to be highly mobile in the direction along the * b*-axis .",
    "our group has already studied nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and related compounds extensively using both neutron scattering @xcite and muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath14sr ) @xcite .",
    "such studies , however , focused on clarifying their unconventional magnetic ground states that arise from the anisotropic q1d spin interactions .",
    "however , in this brief report we instead wish to focus on the high - temperature ion - dynamics connected to the q1d diffusion channels .",
    "a polycrystalline sample of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 was prepared by a solid - state reaction technique under a pressure of 6 gpa using na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath15 and v@xmath0o@xmath16 powders as starting materials .",
    "a mixture of the two powders was packed in an au capsule , then heated at 1300@xmath17c for 1 h , and finally quenched to ambient @xmath18 .",
    "a powder xrd analysis showed that the samples were single phase with an orthorhombic system of space group _ pnma _ at ambient @xmath18 .",
    "dc-@xmath19 data from the present sample reproduce the prior measurements showing the entrance into a af state at @xmath11  145.2  k [ see fig .",
    "the preparation and characterization of our samples were described in greater detail elsewhere @xcite .    for the @xmath14sr experiment ,",
    "approximately 2 grams of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 sample was pressed into a disc with a 24  mm diameter and 1.5  mm thickness . inside a helium glove - box",
    "the disc was packed into a au - sealed ( gold o - ring ) powder cell made of pure titanium using a thin ( @xmath20 m ) kapton film as entrance window for the muons [ see fig  1(c ) ] .",
    "in addition , a silver mask with a hole matching the samples diameter was mounted onto the cell to ensure that the any minor background signal is non - relaxing in a wide temperature range .",
    "the cell was mounted onto the cu end - plate of a liquid - he flow - type cryostat in the temperature range between 10 and 500  k. subsequently , zf- , weak transverse - field ( wtf ) and lf-@xmath14sr spectra were collected using the riken - ral / argus spectrometer at the pulsed muon source isis / ral in uk .",
    "the experimental techniques are described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the diffusive properties of na - ions in the nav@xmath0o@xmath1 compound we have used our previously presented @xmath21sr technique for studying solid state ion diffusion in battery related materials @xcite . in similarity to our previous extensive measurements of both li - ion @xcite and na - ion @xcite diffusion , a series of zf , wtf  =  30  g as well as lf  =  5  g and 10  g @xmath14sr spectra were acquired in the temperature range between 140 and 500  k [ see fig .",
    "2(a - b ) ] . at each temperature , the zf and two lf spectra were fitted by an exponentially relaxing dynamic kubo - toyabe ( kt ) function plus a small background signal from the fraction of muons stopped mainly in the silver mask : @xmath22 furthermore , a global fitting procedure was employed over the entire temperature range using a common alpha ( @xmath23 ) and background asymmetry ( @xmath24 ) , but with temperature dependent field fluctuation rate ( @xmath25 ) and relaxation rate ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the static width of the local field distribution ( @xmath27 ) was from individual fitting found to be more or less independent of temperature [ @xmath28  s@xmath29 and was finally also treated as a common parameter for the global fit over the entire temperature range .",

    "width=155 ]    below ambient temperature , the spectra display a clear static behavior as shown for instance by the @xmath30  k spectra in fig .",
    "2(a ) and with moderately increasing temperature the spectra remains more or less the same .",
    "however , just below ambient temperature a clear dynamic contribution sets in , as shown in the @xmath31  k spectra [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] . the temperature dependence of the na - ion hopping rate [ @xmath32 ] obtained from fitting the data to eq .  1",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen @xmath32 displays a clear diffusive behavior above @xmath2  k. by fitting @xmath32 to an arrhenius type equation [ dashed line in fig .",
    "2(c ) ] , it is possible to extract the activation energy @xmath33  mev .",
    "our results clearly show that the na - ions starts to be mobile above @xmath3 in the nav@xmath0o@xmath1 compound .",
    "in fact it is intriguing that na - ions only become static just above the magnetic transition temperature @xmath11  145.2  k. such situation is rather similar to the layered frustrated magnet na@xmath35coo@xmath0 ( nco ) .",
    "nco is a rather famous compound with an intriguing phase - diagram displaying superconducting @xcite , magnetic @xcite , as well as thermoelectric @xcite phases that strongly depend on the na - content ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it is well known that in nco na - vacancies can be ordered in many different 2d and 3d configurations @xcite and also undergo order - disorder transitions @xcite at several different temperatures depending on the na content ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it was lately demonstrated that the electronic properties of the coo@xmath8 layers are not only governed by the number of conduction electrons on the triangular co layers ( i.e. @xmath36 ) but also the ( periodic ) coulomb potential caused by ( ordered ) na vacancies @xcite . in fact , na ordering and its effect on the fermi surface was found as the key factor that separates the curie - weiss metal ( x  @xmath37  0.5 ) and pauli metal ( x  @xmath38  0.5 ) @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the fermi surface with small fermi - surface pockets caused by na superstructures has later been demonstrated by the shubnikov  de haas ( sdh ) oscillation effect @xcite .",
    "further , schultze @xmath39 proved by muon spin relaxation ( @xmath14sr ) and susceptibility measurements that not only the na order but also the na dynamics is of great importance @xcite .",
    "they observed a new magnetic phase transition at @xmath40=  8  k for @xmath41 samples , that could be connected to thermal history , i.e. na rearrangement / diffusion , in a narrow temperature range around 200  k. this was the first clear proof that the sodium movement at high temperature could strongly influence the low - temperature magnetic properties .",
    "later , other members of the same laboratory followed up this study with an @xmath42na nmr investigation of the same samples @xcite .",
    "their results show a rapidly increasing mobility and diffusion of na ions above 200  k , and finally at @xmath43=  291  k , the na layers melts and enters into a 2d liquid state . above @xmath44 ,",
    "the nmr response is similar to what has been observed only in superionic conductors containing na layers @xcite .",
    "finally , we have within our collaboration very recently revealed new detailed information regarding subtle structural transitions that unlocks the diffusion pathways @xcite as well as presented novel data on the na - diffusion in nco @xcite .",
    "this has opened up intriguing possibilities for tuning fundamental physical properties in correlated electron systems by controlling the dynamic properties and through that the self - assembling structure on a sub - nanoscale @xcite .    from our current @xmath21sr data",
    "it seems very promising that a similar situation could be present also in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "first of all , the low - temperature magnetic structure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 is q1d , rather complex and there has been some questions concerning details of the incommensurate ( ic ) magnetic nature @xcite .",
    "further , the ion - dynamic region is in very close vicinity to the magnetic phase , in fact , much closer than for the above mentioned nco system .",
    "this makes it very plausible that a tuning of the low - temperature q1d incommensurate magnetic order as well as electronic properties can be achieved through a careful control of the na - vacancy landscape .",
    "currently there are no investigations available concerning na - deficient na@xmath35v@xmath0o@xmath1 samples .",
    "however , it would be of high interest for us to investigate how the na - content ( @xmath36 ) affects both the low - temperature magnetic properties as well as how this can be connected to the ion - dynamic phase at temperatures just above the magnetic transition .",
    "finally , the fact that na - ions are mobile around room - temperature also opens the door to possible use of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and related compounds in next generation energy devices / applications . such materials could not only function @xmath5 as an ionic conductor but the direction of conduction would be strongly anisotropic as determined by the q1d crystal structure .",
    "this is very similar to the lifepo@xmath1 battery compound that presently is one of the most promising and investigated cathode materials @xcite .",
    "however , further investigations of na - deficient samples [ na@xmath35v@xmath0o@xmath1 ] are needed using both electrochemical methods as well as miscroscopic studies of ion - diffusion and changes in the atomic structure with @xmath36 .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of isis and riken - ral for their assistance with our @xmath21sr experiments .",
