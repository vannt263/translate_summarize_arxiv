    "upt@xmath7 is generally believed to be a reduced symmetry superconductor , i.e. , one that breaks rotational and/or time reversal symmetries of the normal state , in addition to the u(1 ) gauge symmetry@xcite . the strongest basis for this belief is the phase diagram which displays multiple superconducting phases@xcite , just as liquid @xmath8he has multiple superfluid phases .",
    "in this paper we shall study surface superconductivity in upt@xmath7 , and see if competing models make differing predictions which might be experimentally tested .",
    "we briefly review the existing models for the order parameter in upt@xmath7 .",
    "there are two main classes . the first class , which we shall refer to as ` @xmath2 ' models@xcite , entails a single two - component order parameter , which may belong to any of the two - dimensional representations ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) of @xmath13 , the point group of normal upt@xmath7@xcite .",
    "the second class of models posits two independent order parameters belonging to different representations@xcite .",
    "in one subclass @xcite , which can be analyzed in great detail , comprising what we shall call ` @xmath1 ' models , both order parameters have the same parity ; one transforms as an @xmath14 representation and the other as a @xmath15 representation of @xmath13 .",
    "thus , if the common parity is even@xcite , the pair of order parameters transforms in one of four possible ways : ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath16 , @xmath18 ) , ( @xmath19 , @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath19 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "this division into two classes is useful because in the simplest form of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory in which only terms that are formally of order @xmath20 are kept , all @xmath2 models have the same formal gl free energy , and all @xmath1 models have the same gl free energy .",
    "this leads one to sometimes refer to them in the singular as the @xmath2 model or the @xmath1 model .",
    "the @xmath2 model invokes a symmetry breaking field ( sbf ) , usually taken to be a weak antiferromagnetism that sets in at 5  k@xcite , in order to split the superconducting transition in zero field into two transitions as observed .",
    "the @xmath1 model posits two nearby transition temperatures by fiat . the original version of the @xmath2 model was shown to be incompatible @xcite with experiments in that it fails to yield a tetracritical point in the @xmath21-@xmath6 plane for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "( whether there is or is not a _ true _ tetracritical point in the experimentally observed phase diagram is irrelevant . at",
    "the very least one has two phase boundaries @xmath22 and @xmath23 that approach within 10 - 15  mk of one another , and the outermost line @xmath22 has a sharp change in the sign of the curvature near this apparent tetracritical point .",
    "the theory can not explain this ` near collision ' either . )",
    "this led us to propose the @xmath1 model which does not have this flaw .",
    "our proposal in turn led sauls to propose a refinement of the @xmath2 model@xcite , which has three ingredients : ( i ) a specific @xmath12 order parameter ( see below ) , ( ii ) a nearly cylindrically symmetric fermi surface , and ( iii ) coupling of the gradient terms in the gl free energy to the sbf .",
    "a cylindrical fermi surface causes the dangerous gradient coupling terms in the free energy @xcite to vanish within weak coupling bcs theory for an @xmath24 order parameter , and in conjunction with ingredient ( iii ) restores the tetracritical point for @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we shall use gl theory to calculate @xmath3 for upt@xmath7 within the original @xmath2 model and the @xmath1 model .",
    "the gl free energy for the refined @xmath2 model is mathematically isomorphic to , and can be regarded as a special case of , the @xmath1 model free energy@xcite . since the key issue that determines @xmath3 is the boundary condition on the order parameter , however , the refined @xmath12 model of sauls will have the same @xmath25 curves as the unrefined @xmath12 model for @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , @xmath3 curves may be similar for these two models even when @xmath27 , except that one must beware of kinks in the refined model .",
    "we will limit ourselves to cases where the field @xmath28 and the surface normal @xmath29 lie in high crystal symmetry directions or planes .",
    "further , we only consider ideal , or specularly reflecting surfaces .",
    "the motivation for this study is that we expect qualitative differences in the behavior of @xmath3 between the various models for various geometries .",
    "firstly , the boundary conditions are different amongst the @xmath2 models , leading to differences in @xmath3 . secondly , in the @xmath1 model",
    "the eigenvalue equations for @xmath3 decouple into separate equations for two components , and whenever the surface supports both components , the @xmath3 curve is expected to mirror @xmath30 and show a kink . in the @xmath2 model , on the other hand , even for @xmath31 , the gradient terms can couple the two components .",
    "it is thus possible for the kink in @xmath3 to be smoothed out .",
    "we shall see that whether this happens or not is a question of dynamics , not symmetry .",
    "in fact , there turns out to be no smoothing with the gradient coupling values we use .",
    "a short quantitative estimate of this effect seems to be hard to get , however , so we present the full analysis which follows .",
    "since an experimental measurement of @xmath3 has now been reported @xcite for some of the geometries that we study , we can use our results to restrict the acceptable order parameters for upt@xmath7 .",
    "we also hope that our work will spur a more detailed experimental study of @xmath3 in other geometries as well , as this will sharpen our understanding of the order parameter even further .",
    "we note here that as this paper was being written , we learned of a recent paper by samokhin@xcite , also discussing @xmath3 in upt@xmath7 within @xmath2 models .",
    "samokhin gives a microscopic foundation to the boundary conditions on the order parameter@xcite , while we take a purely phenomenological approach .",
    "further , he focuses on the case where @xmath27 , and the surface normal is arbitrarily oriented in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane .",
    "we have largely avoided detailed study of the @xmath34 geometry because of the problems it presents in comparing to the observed bulk upper critical field .",
    "thus samokhin s work is nicely complementary to ours .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we recapitulate the bare essentials of the theory of surface superconductivity for fully symmetric superconductors with a complex scalar order parameter , paying special attention to the boundary conditions .",
    "we then extend these ideas to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models .",
    "the case of the @xmath2 model is rather rich .",
    "depending on the exact order parameter and field and surface orientation , the surface may or may not suppress superconductivity .",
    "we tabulate these cases and proceed to study them in secs .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "certain technical aspects of the calculations are given in the appendix . in sec .",
    "v , we compare our results with the experiments of keller _ et .",
    "@xcite , and see which order parameters are compatible .",
    "our results are summarized in table iii , and the reader who is not interested in the details of the analysis should skip to that directly .",
    "we conclude with suggestions for future work .",
    "we first recapitulate the theory for a superconductor with a complex scalar order parameter @xmath35 , occupying the half space @xmath36@xcite .",

    "the problem is more interesting when @xmath41 . for an interface with a vacuum or insulator ,",
    "the boundary condition @xmath42 becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gauge covariant derivative .",

    "( [ eqab ] ) that the current is given by @xmath74 at first sight the condition @xmath75 can not be written as a linear equation in @xmath76 .",
    "just as in the case of ordinary superconductors , however , a linear equation can be obtained@xcite , as was first done for @xmath8he - a@xcite .",
    "in contrast to ordinary superconductors , the roughness of the interface is now very important .",
    "a rough surface is in general pair breaking .",
    "since we wish to study the maximum possible enhancement of @xmath3 , we will only consider ideal or specularly reflecting surfaces .",
    "further , as mentioned before , we shall only consider cases where the surface normal @xmath29 and the field @xmath28 lie in high symmetry directions or planes . under these conditions ,",
    "the microscopic analyses @xcite , which we shall not repeat , show that the boundary condition on each component of @xmath76 reduces to @xcite @xmath77 note that both components need not obey the same condition ; one could have @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the general rule can be written as follows .",
    "let us write the momentum - space gap function in the balian - werthamer notation , @xmath80 where @xmath81 or @xmath82 are basis functions of the appropriate representation .",
    "note that in the odd parity case , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are vectors in pseudo - spin space .",
    "the precise boundary conditions in eq .",
    "( [ eqe ] ) are then as follows .",
    "let us denote by @xmath85 the wave vector obtained from @xmath86 by reflection in the plane normal to @xmath29 .",

    "as noted in ref.@xcite , it is unlikely that in reality @xmath88 will be exactly odd or even under reflection normal to any @xmath29 , even those of high symmetry , as the surface will in general flip pseudospin . keeping our goal of studying surface superconductivity under idealized or optimal conditions in mind",

    "in table i we give a few illustrative cases of boundary conditions obtained by applying the above rule to candidate order parameters for upt@xmath7 .",

    "several points about this table should be noted : ( i ) the directions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath92 are fixed along the crystal symmetry directions with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",

    "secondly , one might try and construct variational solutions analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eqba ] ) , with different widths @xmath207 and @xmath208 for @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the energy is then a function of five variational parameters , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath61 , @xmath172 , and a mixing angle , and the minimization is complicated enough that one might as well attempt a nonvariational numerical solution .",
    "this approach does reveal one fact , however .",
    "if @xmath178 is small , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are likely to be similar , and eq .",
    "( [ eqint ] ) shows that the matrix element of @xmath209 is likely to be small .",
    "thus the effect of the off - diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqj ] ) is probably of @xmath210 .",
    "we have therefore solved the eigenvalue problem for @xmath3 numerically .",
    "we do this by working in a basis of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions with unequal length scales @xmath211 for @xmath173 and @xmath174 . only even parity ( about @xmath117 ) functions are used in accord with the boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqj ] ) is almost diagonal in this basis .",
    "the evaluation of the off - diagonal terms is described in the appendix .",
    "we find the lowest eigenvalue @xmath212 and associated eigenfunction @xmath213 of @xmath214 numerically for given @xmath172 and @xmath61 , and minimize with respect to @xmath172 and @xmath61 via the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the required gradients are efficiently found using the identity @xmath215 and a similar one for the @xmath61 derivative .",
    "these calculations are done for @xmath177 ranging from 0.1 to 10 .",
    "this range is large enough to encompass the kink region comfortably , as all terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqj ] ) are of order unity .",
    "we find that for @xmath216 , @xmath172 is numerically equal to zero for all @xmath217 values considered .",
    "in fact , @xmath172-mixing occurs only for @xmath218 , but the resulting anticrossing is very narrow , and substantial curvature in @xmath25 is only visibly evident for @xmath219 .",
    "thus , for experimentally relevant values of @xmath178 , the picture for @xmath3 is the same as in fig .",
    "3 , i.e. , the @xmath5 ratio is always ideal and there is a kink in @xmath3@xcite . once again , we expect to see inner @xmath3 lines which we have not explicitly calculated .",

    "as can be seen from table i , except for the @xmath201 order parameter , the boundary conditions call for only one of the @xmath224 to vanish at the surface .",

    "an @xmath139 order parameter behaves as a vector in the @xmath46-@xmath47 plane , and so if we rotate the surface normal @xmath29 , keeping @xmath236 , the boundary conditions on @xmath76 rotate in the same way , and we get an isotropic @xmath3 .    for the @xmath10 and @xmath220 order parameters",
    ", we can see from table i that the same component , @xmath173 , is supported by the surface for both @xmath237 and @xmath125 . for any @xmath180 , this component must have the lower @xmath238 for one orientation , and the higher @xmath238 for the other , leading to different answers for @xmath3 . in terms of symmetry , this can be understood by saying that as @xmath29 is rotated in the basal plane , an @xmath140 order parameter rotates at twice the rate of a vector . denoting the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath169 by @xmath239 , the boundary conditions change with @xmath239 , reversing every @xmath240 .",
    "thus the sbf and the surface will act in concert for one geometry in fig . 4 , and opposition for the other .",
    "we study the cases of surface and sbf in concert and in opposition separately below .",
    "it is convenient to fix @xmath241 , so that @xmath174 always has the higher @xmath238 , and to rotate @xmath29 and @xmath168 as needed .",

    "now , by the argument of the previous subsection , we expect the same @xmath3 behavior in the two geometries for the @xmath10 and @xmath220 order parameters , and opposite behavior for the the @xmath139 order parameters .",
    "the two types of behavior , i.e. , surface and sbf in concert and opposition , can be seen by studying the @xmath9 case with @xmath269 . for fig .",

    "the assumption of fixed @xmath165 parallel to @xmath268 may not be physically relevant , however .",

    "we tentatively conclude that the @xmath3 curve is of the type shown in fig . 1 ,",
    "i.e. , there is surface superconductivity in only one component , and it onsets at @xmath299 .",
    "this picture is obtained within the @xmath126 and @xmath300 models if @xmath119 . within the @xmath301 model",
    "the predicted picture is that of fig .",
    "3 , whether @xmath302 or @xmath121 . this does not seem to fit the observations , which would appear to exclude the specific @xmath303 order parameter listed in table i. within the @xmath2 models , the picture requires that @xmath173 have the higher @xmath238 when @xmath304 , i.e. @xmath305 .",
    "this in turn requires @xmath235 for the @xmath139 models , and @xmath229 for the @xmath140 models .",

    "since data are not given at any other @xmath6 , the picture of @xmath25 could resemble any of our figs . 1 , 3 , or 6 .",
    "for the @xmath1 models we expect the same qualitative behavior as when @xmath307 , since the direction of * h * in the plane normal to @xmath29 does not alter the boundary conditions .",
    "for any of the four @xmath2 models ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath220 ) , on the other hand , a little work shows that if we assume that @xmath308 stays fixed along @xmath309 , then the sign of @xmath176 in table ii is such that for the present geometry the surface and sbf are in opposition .",
    "this would imply no surface superconductivity . as argued in sec .",
    "iv c , however , a reorientation of @xmath165 is quite possible , in which case all four @xmath2 models would lead to an @xmath3 curve as in fig .",
    "we thus see that the present @xmath3 data can only be used to exclude ( and not very confidently at that ) the @xmath303 order parameter in table i. we can however predict the expected behavior for the other geometries based on the results in secs .",
    "iii and iv , given the restrictions in table ii .",
    "these predictions are summarized in table iii , which is the main result of our paper .",
    "it can be seen that widely different results are obtained for the geometries @xmath310 and @xmath311 . the case @xmath312 distinguishes between @xmath139 and @xmath140 models and between @xmath2 and @xmath1 models , if one can confidently detect the presence or absence of a kink in @xmath3 .",
    "the case with @xmath313 and @xmath314 distinguishes between the odd and even parity @xmath2 models , and the @xmath1 models .",
