    "for @xmath8 the map has a closed invariant set on which it is topologically conjugate to the tent map , so @xmath9 .",
    "thus , as @xmath10 passes a half , the sudden appearance of a full tent map produces a discontinuity of the topological entropy . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that for certain one - parameter families of smooth maps the topological entropy is even hlder continuous ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a somewhat milder way of changing the map is to fix the map itself but to change the interval of definition , that is to introduce ` holes ' in the map . in dynamical terms , if a point in the domain of definition hits the hole under iteration of the map , it is not allowed to evolve any further .",
    "the motivational idea is a physical system for which mass leaks through an opening in phase space .",
    "this set - up has received considerable attention over the past decades ( see @xcite for a snapshot of recent developments ) .",
    "most of the efforts have been directed to studying the escape rate of mass through the hole as well as showing the existence of conditionally invariant measures with good statistical properties for various classes of maps , as well as conditions on the hole , typically that the hole is either part of a markov partition for the map ( see , for example , @xcite ) or that the hole is ` small ' ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in a similar vein",
    ", the behaviour of the escape rate as the size of the hole shrinks to zero has also been studied in some detail ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this article , we shall focus on the regularity of the topological entropy @xmath11 of a fixed piecewise monotonic expanding interval map @xmath12 as a function of the hole @xmath13 , without any assumptions on the size or position of @xmath13 . roughly speaking",
    "we shall show that if @xmath14 is a neighbourhood of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a family of holes varying sufficiently regularly in the space of holes , then , under a mild expansivity condition on @xmath0 , the function @xmath17 is continuous at @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath19 , then @xmath17 is even hlder continuous at @xmath18 with hlder exponent at @xmath18 depending on @xmath20 .    in order to provide a more precise formulation of these results , we require some more notation .    [ def : map ]",

    ", it follows that @xmath39 is uniformly bounded from below , so the number @xmath37 measures the growth rate of the maximal expansion of @xmath31 .",
    "let us now make the notion of a hole more precise .",
    "for @xmath40 we write @xmath41 for the collection of sets @xmath42 which may be written as a union of at most @xmath43 closed subintervals of @xmath1 .",
    "we then define @xmath44 to be our ` space of holes ' and equip it with the following distance function @xmath45 note that this distance is a pseudometric , that is , it is a _ bona fide _ metric , except that the distance between two holes may vanish without the holes coinciding .",
    "note also that it does not distinguish the number of intervals constituting a hole .    given a map @xmath22 and a hole @xmath13 as above",
    ", we will be interested in the dynamics of the map restricted to the complement of @xmath13 .",

    "here , we choose to set @xmath49 in this case , as this assures continuity of the topological entropy , as we shall see in the following . ]",
    "topological entropy of the restricted map is then given by the exponential growth rate of the number of elements in @xmath48 @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",

    "shortly , the order of this pole plays a role for the degree of regularity of the topological entropy of @xmath0 at @xmath13 .    our main result on the regularity of the topological entropy as a function of the hole , to be proved in section  [ sec : htop ] ,",

    "furthermore , if   @xmath61   then @xmath60 is hlder continuous at @xmath18 with local hlder exponent ( see definition [ def : holder ] ) satisfying @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the order of the pole of the resolvent of @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "it is rather curious that the local hlder exponent of the topological entropy at a particular hole depends itself on the value of the topological entropy at that hole .",
    "a similar behaviour of the topological entropy , albeit not for maps with holes , but for one - parameter deformations of the tent map , has already been conjectured by isola and politi in the early nineties ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "our numerical simulations also indicate that the factor @xmath63 can not be omitted in the above formula .",
    "the theorem above is in fact a special case of a more general theorem with similar hypotheses and similar conclusions , but with the behaviour of the topological entropy as a function of the hole replaced by the behaviour of the topological pressure as a function of the potential ( see corollary  [ coro : main ] ) .",
    "the proof of the theorem above and its generalisation relies on a spectral perturbation theorem of keller and liverani  @xcite , which has opened up a rich seam of applications in various areas .",
    "in fact , our proof relies on a refinement of the keller - liverani theorem ( see corollary  [ coro : ourcoro ] ) which is of interest in its own right and elucidates the role of the pole of the resolvent of the perturbed operator .    as an illustration of the theorem above we consider the topological entropy of the doubling map @xmath66 on the unit interval with a uniformly left - expanding hole , that is , we are interested in the regularity of the function @xmath67)\\,.\\ ] ] it is not difficult to see that @xmath68 , so the first part of the theorem above immediately implies that @xmath69 is continuous , thus giving a new proof of a result originally due to urbaski ( *",
