    "a suitable linear combination of the two paths on @xmath1 then defines a cycle @xmath81 for @xmath95 . since @xmath21 is unbranched on @xmath23 , i.e. a homeomorphism , and since @xmath117=b_\\pi\\subset [ s_1]\\cup\\dots\\cup [ s_n]$ ] , @xmath118\\cup\\dots \\cup [ s_n])]$ ] consists of two disjoint connected manifolds whose boundaries both are equal to @xmath119\\cup\\dots \\cup \\pi^{-1}[s_n]$ ] and @xmath9 interchanges those manifolds .",

    "we will see later on that , due to the intersection numbers , the cycles @xmath125 are not homologous to each other . by construction ,",
    "each cycle @xmath81 contains the two ramification points @xmath115 and @xmath116 of @xmath21 and no other ramification points .",

    "this yields the desired @xmath124 paths @xmath129 in @xmath19 .",
    "lifting these paths via @xmath21 yields each @xmath124 paths on @xmath120 and @xmath124 paths on @xmath121 $ ] .",

    "two cycles can not be homologeous to each other if the intersection number of each one of those cycles with a third cycle is not equal , hence @xmath151 implies that the above construction yields @xmath152 cycles @xmath81 and @xmath82 which are not homologous to each other . to construct the missing @xmath153 cycles , we choose a symplectic cycle basis @xmath154 of @xmath63 such that they intersect none of the paths @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "this is possible since all of these paths in @xmath19 are connected and hence can be contracted to a point . on the preimage of @xmath157\\cup [ t_j])\\cup [ s_n]\\}$ ] , the map @xmath21 is a homeomorphism .",
    "so each of the cycles in @xmath63 is lifted to one cycle in @xmath120 and one cycle in @xmath121 $ ] via @xmath21 and those two cycles are interchanged by @xmath9 . thus lifting the whole basis yields @xmath153 cycles on @xmath1 where we denote the @xmath158 cycles lifted to @xmath120 as @xmath77 and @xmath79 and the corresponding cycles lifted to @xmath121 $ ] as @xmath78 and @xmath80 .",
    "then these cycles obey the desired transformation behaviour under @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath120 and @xmath121 $ ] are disjoint , the intersection number of the lifted cycles on @xmath1 stays the same as the intersection number of the corresponding cycles on @xmath19 if two cycles are lifted to the same sheet @xmath120 respectively @xmath121 $ ] or equals zero if they are lifted to different sheets .",
    "furthermore , the construction of these cycles ensured that the lifted @xmath87- and @xmath88-cycles do not intersect any of the @xmath90- and @xmath7-cycles on @xmath1 .",
    "hence @xmath159 and @xmath82 are in total @xmath72 cycles which obey condition .",
    "so by hurwitz formula , they represent a symplectic basis of @xmath62 and the @xmath87- and @xmath90-cycles are disjoint .",
    "that the @xmath90- and @xmath7-cycles constructed like this have the desired transformation behavior under @xmath76 is shown in the next lemma .",

    "so @xmath163=[c_j]$ ] and the two points @xmath115 and @xmath116 stay fixed . therefore @xmath164 .",
    "since @xmath9 commutes the two lifts of the path @xmath94 in @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the only fixed points of @xmath9 on @xmath81 , one has @xmath83 . by the same means ,",
