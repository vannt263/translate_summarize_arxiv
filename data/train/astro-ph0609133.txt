    "the approximate total exposure times are 270s for each irac band , 48 , 38 , and 25s for the mips bands , 280s for each irs sl , and 360s for each ll module .",
    "the pipeline processed mips and irac image mosaics were of good quality , and we used them without further processing .",
    "the analysis of the irs spectra is complicated by the fact that n132d is a non - uniform , extended source superposed with a complex background adjacent to a molecular cloud ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n132d ] ) .",
    "moreover , the _ spitzer _",
    "science pipeline is optimized for point sources , and the extraction of extended sources from the default pipeline products results in biased spectra .",
    "our principal data reduction strategy for the irs spectra consists therefore of the following steps :    \\(1 ) starting from the s13.2.0 pipeline products , we interpolated bad pixels flagged by the pipeline , and removed rogue pixels by subtracting nearby sky positions taken from the _ spitzer _ archive for each sl / ll module ( see sect .",

    "[ sec;background ] ) ;    \\(4 ) basic aperture and slit loss correction assuming a uniform , extended source , to account for the bias introduced by the point source optimized _ spitzer _ science pipeline .",
    "we derived a correction function by modelling the _ spitzer _ point - spread - function ( psf ) for a range of wavelengths with the software stinytim@xmath8 developed by john krist , and then dividing the fraction of the psf admitted by the slit as defined by the slit - width and wavelength dependent extraction aperture by the sum over the whole psf .",
    "the resulting flux correction functions have wavelength dependent values of 0.80.6 for sl and 0.850.65 for ll .",
    "further division of the corrected flux density by the extracted area given by the slit - width and the extraction aperture yields spectra in surface brightness units , i.e.  flux density per steradian , which can be directly compared to the irac and mips fluxes .",
    "note that irac fluxes are calibrated for point sources , but established point - to - extended source flux correction factors are available @xcite ;    \\(5 ) we removed fringes that appear in ll1 at 19.524.0@xmath0  with the smart defringing tool , averaged multiple spectra of the same region , and finally merged sl and ll spectra .",
    "note that we extracted the sl and ll spectra of the southeastern rim from two slightly offset positions , because the small overlap region covered by both slits is positioned just outside the brightest regions in the southeastern rim ( cf .",
    "[ fig : n132d ] ) .",
    "the two extracted regions are separated by about 10 , and the mips24@xmath0  fluxes in both regions differ by only 10 percent , whereas the irac channel 3 and 4 fluxes are comparable .",
    "a meaningful background subtraction of the spectra is one of the most critical and difficult tasks , and of major importance for this work .",
    "commonly , either a spatially close spectral nod or a dedicated off - source position are subtracted to remove the background .",
    "both of these methods are problematic in our case , since we are facing a complex , non - uniform background ( cf .",

    "we measured emission line fluxes , central wavelengths , and full - widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) from line fitting with the iraf ` spectool ' package .",
    "due to the low resolution of the irs spectrograph in our setting , @xmath7 at 18@xmath0 , the lines are usually unresolved or marginally resolved , and represent a convolution of the true line profile with the instrumental profile .",
    "we used gaussians to fit the line profiles of atomic lines/@xmath10  and lorentzians for discrete pah features .",
    "our quoted fwhm are not deconvolved from the instrumental irs profile .",

    "[ fig : n132dspec_spatialvariation ] ) . for this particular task",
    ", we employed a slightly different data extraction strategy . in order to improve the spatial resolution , we narrowed the default spice extraction aperture by a factor of two , giving extraction widths of about 12  for ll2 and 20  for ll1 near the central wavelengths of each module .",
    "this procedure systematically reduces measured fluxes by about a factor of two compared to the calibrated default extractions , which is of no concern as long as we compare only relative fluxes of extended emission extracted in that same fashion .",
    "we subtracted the continuum by fitting a low - order legendre polynomial using spectral regions that are free of emission lines , usually below 15 and above 19@xmath0 .",
    "for the southeastern rim of n132d , this method gives a similar continuum fit for the ll2 1421@xmath0  region than the modified - blackbody fit shown in fig .",

    "the surface brightness distribution follows the x - ray contours very well ( cf .  fig .",

    "interpretation of the 16.4@xmath0  feature above ) .",
    "finally , the specific local physical conditions affect the charge state , the amount of dehydrogenation , and the heating process of the pah molecules .",
    "nevertheless , it is illustrative to note some general trends when comparing the observed pah emission ratios in table  [ tab : pahlineratios ] with calculated pah band radiation efficiencies as function of size for a diffuse ism mix of neutral / ionized pahs ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "we approximate the predicted , total emitted power in the 1520@xmath0  region by scaling the calculated 17.4@xmath0  band power with the total integrated absorption cross section per c atom in the 1520@xmath0  range divided by the cross section for the 17.4@xmath0  band .",
    "this gives approximately a scale factor of 4 , using the cross sections per c atom adopted by @xcite .",
    "the lowest observed 1520/11.3 , 1520/6.2 , 16.4/11.3 , and 16.4/6.2@xmath0  ratios in table  [ tab : pahlineratios ] correspond then to the smallest pahs considered in the calculations by @xcite , which contain about 20 carbon atoms .",
    "pahs smaller than about 2050 c atoms are photolytically unstable ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the pah size distribution of the sources near the top of table  [ tab : pahlineratios ] is probably dominated by pahs of that size .",
    "this is generally consistent with earlier estimates of pah sizes derived from the 3.3 and 3.4@xmath0",
    "c - h stretching modes ( * ? ? ? * table  3 ) , and from profile fitting of the pah 3.3 - 11.3@xmath0  bands with calculated spectra from a distribution of small pahs @xcite .    for the supernova remnant",
    "n132d , we expect that small grains / pahs are rapidly destroyed by thermal sputtering ( cf .",
    "[ sec;irsgrainprocessing_discussion ] ) , i.e.  relatively larger grains / pahs tend to dominate the size distribution , which is consistent with the high pah 1520@xmath0  to 11.3@xmath0  ratio and the absence of discrete 1520@xmath0  features .",
    "a pah 1520@xmath0  to 11.3@xmath0  ratio of @xmath27 as observed in n132d corresponds to pah sizes of about 20  or 4000 c atoms , if we adopt the calculations by @xcite as a tentative guideline .",
    "this number is a rough estimate , since electron collisions rather than starlight dominate grain heating in n132d , changing the amount and frequency of energy deposition into grains compared to the model calculations .",
    "in addition , even large pahs may be dehydrogenated in the hot plasma of n132d , which provides another rationale for the weak 11.3@xmath0  feature and the resulting high 1520/11.3@xmath0  ratio . as a consequence ,",
    "the size estimate from that ratio is probably an upper limit , since pahs in n132d have most likely a higher degree of dehydrogenation than in the diffuse ism .",
    "a lower limit estimate of the pah sizes in n132d from the 1520/6.2@xmath0ratio is about 500 c atoms , which is similar to the sizes of the very small grains / large pahs proposed as carriers of the broad plateaus underlying the 614@xmath0  pah features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec : discussion_pahlines ] ) .",
    "the lifetime of 5004000 c atom grains , about 0.0010.002@xmath0  in size , is 80160yr according to eq .",
    "[ eqn;thermsput ] , which describes thermal sputtering of silicate / graphite grains in the forward shock of n132d .",
    "we presume that large pahs / amorphous carbon particles behave similarly to graphite in terms of stability against thermal sputtering , which is a reasonable assumption since both consist mainly of aromatic carbon ring systems .",
    "thus , it is plausible for large pahs to survive thermal sputtering in n132d long enough to maintain a detectable population , particularly since both pahs and grains will be replenished as the shock wave keeps expanding into new ism material .",
    "we detected strong mips24@xmath0  emission from swept - up , shock - heated dust grains in the young lmc supernova remnant n132d ( sect .",
    "[ sec;mipsdiscussion ] ) .",
    "in addition , we reported the first detection of pah bands from a snr , with tentative pah features between 6 and 9@xmath0 , a weak 11.3@xmath0  feature , and a prominent 1520@xmath0emission hump .",
    "this adds to the growing body of sources showing 1520@xmath0  emission , which is interpreted as bending modes of large pahs ( sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion_pahlines ] ) .",
    "overall , our observations show that dust grains survive a strong supernova shock , which is consistent with our estimates of the dust destruction rate by thermal sputtering ( sect .",
    "[ sec;irsgrainprocessing_discussion ] ) .",
    "our results also support the proposed correlation of pah size and the 1520 to 11.3@xmath0  emission ratio @xcite .",
    "the ratio of 1520@xmath0  to 11.3@xmath0  emission in n132d is notably higher compared to other types of sources , which we interpret as rapid destruction of small pahs / grains in the supernova blast wave via thermal sputtering , and possible dehydrogenation of the remaining pah population in the high temperature plasma .",
    "we conclude that large pahs / amorphous carbon particles with approximately 5004000 c atoms survive the harsh conditions in the forward shock of n132d long enough to be detected in our spectra ( sect .",

    "future observations of supernova remnants of various ages located in different environments will probe whether , and what fraction of dust grains and pahs are ultimately able to survive the aftermath of strong supernova shock waves .    this work is based on observations made with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
