    "on september 14 , 2015 at 09:50:45 utc the advanced ligo detectors observed the first gravitational - wave transient gw150914 @xcite .",
    "the gw was inferred to have arisen from the merger of black holes in a binary system at a luminosity distance @xmath4 mpc .",
    "the estimated amount of energy released in the form of gravitational waves was @xmath5 solar masses @xcite .",
    "a second gw event gw151226 @xcite was detected at 03:38:53 utc on december 26 , 2015 , also inferred to be produced by the merger of two black holes at a distance @xmath6 mpc . in this case",
    "the amount of energy released in the form of gw was @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "mergers of stellar - mass black holes are not expected to have any electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "however , observations with the fermi gbm detector have revealed the presence of a transient source above 50 kev , only 0.4 s after gw150914 and with localization consistent with its direction @xcite and with a possible association with a short gamma - ray burst @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", other gamma - ray and x - ray observatories did not find any potential counterpart either for gw150914 @xcite or for gw151226 @xcite .",
    "mergers of black holes provide a potential environment where cosmic rays can be accelerated to ultrahigh - energies ( uhes ) provided there are magnetic fields and disk debris remaining from the formation of the black holes @xcite",
    ". the estimated rate of this type of mergers can account for the total energy observed in ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) and their distribution in the sky .",
    "such a system may also emit ultrahigh - energy gamma rays and neutrinos @xcite .",
    "other models speculate on the possibility that protons could be accelerated up to @xmath8 eev energies in a one - shot boost @xcite .",
    "collisions of uhe protons with photon backgrounds and gas surrounding the black hole would produce uhe neutrinos .",
    "the remarkable power of gw150914 could produce a proton spectrum peaked at eev energies with a lesser emission of neutrinos in the pev energy range @xcite .",
    "neutrino experiments with peak sensitivities in the tev - pev energy range such as icecube and antares have reported no neutrino candidates in spatial and temporal coincidence with gw150914 @xcite .    with the surface detector ( sd ) of the pierre auger observatory",
    "@xcite we can identify neutrino - induced air showers in the energy range above 100 pev @xcite .",
    "showers induced by neutrinos at large zenith angles can start their development deep in the atmosphere so that they have a considerable amount of electromagnetic component at the ground ( `` young '' shower front ) . on the other hand ,",
    "at large zenith angles the atmosphere is thick enough that the electromagnetic component of the more numerous nucleonic cosmic rays , which interact shortly after entering the atmosphere , gets absorbed and the shower front at ground level is dominated by muons ( `` old '' shower front ) .",
    "the sd consists of @xmath9 water - cherenkov stations spread over an area of @xmath10 , separated by @xmath11 and arranged in a triangular grid .",
    "although the sd is not separately sensitive to the muonic and electromagnetic components of the shower , nor to the depth at which the shower is initiated , the signals produced by the passage of shower particles , digitized with 25 ns time resolution @xcite , allow us to distinguish narrow traces in time induced by inclined showers initiated high in the atmosphere , from the broad signals expected in inclined showers initiated close to the ground . applying this simple idea , with the sd of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite we can efficiently detect inclined showers and search for two types of neutrino - induced showers at energies above 100 pev :    1 .",
    "earth - skimming ( es ) showers induced by tau neutrinos ( @xmath12 ) that travel in a slightly upward direction . a can skim the earth s crust and interact near the surface , inducing a tau lepton which escapes the earth and decays in flight in the atmosphere , close to the sd .",
    "typically , only -induced showers with zenith angles @xmath13 may be identified .",
    "showers initiated by neutrinos of any flavor moving down at large zenith angles @xmath14 with respect to the vertical and that interact in the atmosphere close to the surface - detector array through charged - current or neutral - current interactions .",
    "these will be referred to as downward - going high zenith angle ( dgh ) neutrinos .    in previous publications",
    "@xcite methods were established to identify inclined and deeply - initiated showers with the sd of the pierre auger observatory .",
    "these were applied blindly to search for es and dgh neutrinos in the data collected with the sd up to 20 june 2013 .",
    "no neutrino candidate was found . as a result",
    "an upper limit to the diffuse flux of uhe neutrinos ( i.e. , from an ensemble of unresolved sources ) was obtained in @xcite .",
    "also the same analysis was applied to place upper limits on continuous ( in time ) point - like sources of uhe neutrinos @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the same identification criteria as in @xcite to search for neutrinos in temporal and spatial coincidence with gw150914 and gw151226 , as well as with the gw candidate event lvt151012 @xcite .",
    "the search was performed within @xmath3 s around the time of either gw event as well as in the period of 1 day after their occurrence .",
    "the choice of these two rather broad time windows is motivated by the association of mergers of compact systems and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 s window corresponds to an upper limit on the duration of the prompt phase of grbs , when typically pev neutrinos are thought to be produced in interactions of accelerated cosmic rays and the gamma rays within the grb itself . the choice of the 1-day window after the gw event is a conservative upper limit on the duration of grb afterglows , where ultrahigh - energy neutrinos are thought to be produced in interactions of uhecrs with the lower - energy photons of the grb afterglow ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the results of the search allow us to set constraints on the emission of uhe neutrinos from the merger of two black holes .",
    "these constraints apply in the energy range [ @xmath15 100 pev , @xmath15 25 eev ] and are complementary to those of icecube / antares @xcite which apply in the energy range [ @xmath15 100 gev , @xmath15 100 pev ] .",
    "the neutrino identification criteria applied to data collected with the pierre auger observatory are summarized in reference @xcite .",
    "firstly , inclined showers are selected in the different angular ranges of the es and dgh channels .",
    "secondly , deeply - penetrating showers are identified in the inclined - event sample through the broad time structure of the signals expected to be induced in the water - cherenkov sd stations indicative of the presence of an electromagnetic component @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to uhe neutrinos in auger is limited to large zenith angles . as a consequence at each instant in time",
    ", neutrinos can be detected efficiently only from a specific portion of the sky .",
    "a source at declination @xmath16 and right ascension ( ra ) @xmath17 ( in equatorial coordinates ) is seen at the latitude of auger ( @xmath18 ) and at a given sidereal time @xmath19 with a zenith angle @xmath20 given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the duration of one sidereal day . from eq .",

    "that cosmic rays are indeed accelerated as suggested in @xcite , our constraints on the diffuse flux of uhe neutrinos would imply that either ( 1 ) the optical depth to neutrino production is significantly smaller than 1 as expected in grb models ; or ( 2 ) only a fraction of the luminosity that can be extracted from the bh can be invested in uhecrs acceleration , or ( 3 ) only a fraction of the energy of the protons goes into charged pions ( that are the parents of the neutrinos ) ; or ( 4 ) a combination of the three possibilities .",

    "similar analyses to those presented in this work will be important to provide constraints on the progenitors of the gw emission .",
    "given the inferred rate of events @xmath90 @xcite new gw events can be expected in the near future , closer to earth and/or more energetic , and/or produced by another type of source that is more likely to accelerate uhecrs and produce uhe neutrinos than the merger of two black holes , such as for instance binary neutron - star mergers , and core - collapse supernovae with rapidly - rotating cores @xcite .    finally , the detection of uhe neutrino candidates in coincidence with gw events could help in pinpointing the position of the source of gw with an accuracy of a few @xmath91 given the angular resolution of the pierre auger observatory for inclined showers ( better than @xmath92 ) , to be compared with the currently known position of the two gw events @xmath93 .",
