    "in one dimension , the largest cluster in percolation bears some resemblance to the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation , which is known to exhibit similar limiting statistics ( see ref .",

    "of course , the interesting cases of percolation , however , are in higher dimensions , which we address here .",

    "therefore , as a natural first approximation we assume @xmath0 independent selections from a continuous parent distribution with exponential decay @xmath77 where @xmath5 is an effective crossover size ( see below ) .",

    "there appears to be a problem with ( [ eq : xizero ] ) for percolation on a lattice : a discrete c.d.f . ( which is a piecewise constant function ) can not converge to a continuous function when scaled by a bounded standard deviation .",

    "because the limiting sequence ( [ eq : step ] ) fluctuates periodically about a certain fixed distribution , it can be viewed as a `` limit cycle '' in some appropriate banach space ( see below ) .",
    "intuitively , the distribution conforms asymptotically to the fisher - tippett distribution as closely as possible within the constraints imposed by discreteness .",
    "the simple derivation of ( [ eq : step ] ) should be valid whenever @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 or @xmath105 ) because then even a single site qualifies as a large cluster . if @xmath106 , however , non - negligible correlations among the r.v .",

    "such trajectories never feel much influence from the critical fixed point because correlation effects are dominated by discrete - lattice effects , due to proximity of the @xmath224 fixed point . for larger values of @xmath28 such that @xmath243 , however , subcritical trajectories at first approach the critical fixed point ( @xmath244 ) before crossing over to the subcritical limit cycles ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "this crossover behavior was demonstrated for the mean and variance above in figs .",
    "[ fig : mu][fig : sigma ] , but it also holds for the shape of the distribution .    in the vicinity of the critical fixed point ( @xmath245 ) , trajectories obey a different rg reflecting the dominance of long - range correlations .",
    "the critical fixed point is unstable in the sense that subcritical and supercritical trajectories eventually crossover to a different limiting behavior along the direction of an unstable manifold .",
    "one such `` crossover manifold '' shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg ] , which connects the critical and subcritical fixed points , corresponds to the limits @xmath246 and @xmath97 with @xmath247 for some constant @xmath248 .",
    "likewise , the stable manifold converging to the critical fixed point corresponds to the limit @xmath246 with @xmath39 .",
    "more than seventy years ago , frchet  @xcite and fisher and tippett  @xcite deduced the possible limiting distributions for extremes for i.i.d .",
    "r.v . with the following ingenious argument : if one partitions @xmath237 i.i.d . r.v . into @xmath238 disjoint subsets containing @xmath239 r.v .",
    "each , then the largest of the @xmath249 outcomes is equal to the largest of the @xmath238 largest outcomes in each subset of size @xmath239 @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the largest outcome in the @xmath68th subset .",
    "since the @xmath252 are themselves i.i.d .",
    "r.v . , the c.d.f .",
    "@xmath58 of @xmath40 obeys the exact recursion @xmath253 for all @xmath239 and @xmath238 ( @xmath254 ) . in terms of the normalized distribution ( [ eq : gdef ] ) , the recursion takes the form @xmath255 which is essentially the subcritical rg for the normalized largest - cluster size distribution in percolation , but we must also address correlations and discreteness . in going from ( [ eq :",
    "frg ] ) to ( [ eq : grg ] ) we have defined a `` renormalized '' order - parameter distribution for percolation valid near the subcritical fixed point , in much the same way that the kadanoff - wilson block - spin construction defines a renormalized coupling constant for the ising model valid near the critical fixed point  @xcite .",
    "the power of the cell - renormalization approach is that it provides a natural way to bound correlations and show that the subcritical limit cycles in percolation are described by the same rg as in the case of independent random variables ( except for the subtle , persistent fluctuations due to discreteness described earlier ) .",
    "this is demonstrated rigorously in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we simply explain the basic ideas of these authors . the strategy of the proof ( inspired by fisher and tippett ) is to fix the number of cells @xmath256 and let the size of each cell @xmath239 diverge .",
    "since correlations decay exponentially with distance in the subcritical regime , it seems plausible that the `` renormalized '' cell random variables @xmath252 would become uncorrelated ( as the surface - to - volume ratio vanishes ) in the limit @xmath241 , at least if the dimension were not too high ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "precise bounds on the intercell correlations can be obtained as follows  @xcite . if the cells were independent ( with free boundary conditions )",
    "we would have @xmath257 as above , but due to correlations we have instead the upper bound @xmath258 because joining the @xmath238 cells together ( and thus allowing clusters to connect and grow ) can only increase the size of the largest cluster ( and thus decrease the probability that the largest cluster has size @xmath259 ) . a lower bound",
    "can be obtained by considering a set of `` supercells '' ( again with free boundary conditions ) formed by appending a `` skin '' of _ linear _ width @xmath260 to each of the original cells , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgpicture ] .",
    "if the mass of the largest cluster intersected with each of these overlapping supercells were independently @xmath259 , then the largest cluster overall would also have mass @xmath259 ( because even a linear chain of length @xmath16 would necessarily be completely contained in one supercell ) , which yields@xcite @xmath261 these inequalities , which are valid for any dimension @xmath262 , are the analogs of the frchet - fisher - tippett `` rg '' ( [ eq : frg ] ) for subcritical percolation , and from them the fisher - tippett behavior of the subcritical limit cycles can be established  @xcite .",
    "heuristically , it is quite plausible that if the `` typical '' largest cluster size , say within @xmath17 standard deviations of the mean @xmath263 does not grow too fast , i.e. @xmath264 as @xmath241 with @xmath238 and @xmath17 fixed , then ( [ eq : fineq ] ) should reduce asymptotically to ( [ eq : frg ] ) . given the results of borgs et al .",
    "( [ eq : borgs3.1])([eq : borgs3.5 ] ) , we actually expect the much stronger bound @xmath265 .",
    "as explained below , this logarithmic scaling selects the fisher - tippett distribution @xmath3 from among the possible fixed points of ( [ eq : frg ] ) .",
    "the subcritical fixed point is described by the classical theory for extremes of i.i.d .",
    "following fisher and tippett  @xcite , let us assume for now that a continuous fixed point of ( [ eq : grg ] ) exists pointwise for all @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath266 as @xmath246 and @xmath97 such that @xmath267 .",
    "in this case , there must exist finite constants @xmath268 and @xmath22 defined by    _",
    "m = a_n + _ m = b_n [ eq : ab ]    such that the limiting distribution @xmath269 obeys the equation  @xcite @xmath270 which was first discovered by fisher and tippett  @xcite .",
    "this functional equation has exactly three solutions , given in table  [ table : ft ] , up to trivial translations and rescalings of @xmath17 by constants . in the case of i.i.d .",
    "the basins of attraction of these three fixed points , which depend only on the tail of the parent distribution , were first characterized by gnedenko  @xcite . in the case of percolation ,",
    "we have argued above that the appropriate parent distribution has an exponential tail , which suggests that the fisher - tippett distribution is indeed the subcritical fixed point ( again , ignoring discreteness ) .    still assuming that a continuous limiting distribution @xmath269 exists , let us make the following additional assumptions    _ n & ~ & s_^ * n + _ n - _ n-1 & = & o(1/n ) [ eq : scalings ]    which are clearly supported by our numerical simulations and are consistent with the rigorous results ( [ eq : borgs3.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : borgs3.5 ] ) .",
    "these scaling axioms are expected to hold for all @xmath51 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbound ] ) implies @xmath271 ; with the fact that @xmath64 must be an increasing sequence , it also implies @xmath272 for all @xmath273 ( see @xcite ) . from ( [ eq : mscale ] ) and ( [ eq : bn ] ) , we have @xmath274 there are two possibilities : @xmath275 and @xmath276 for some constant @xmath277 .",
    "in the former case , we have @xmath278 and hence @xmath279 ( see table  [ table : ft ] ) , which is a contradiction . in the latter case , @xmath280 . without loss of generality we can set @xmath281 ( since this simply amounts to rescaling @xmath17 ) and",
    "obtain the equation @xmath282 whose only nontrivial solution is @xmath3 .",
    "this also implies that the standard deviation converges to a constant proportional to the crossover size , @xmath283 .      of course , the assumption of pointwise convergence to a continuous limiting distribution is wrong ( e.g. see fig .  [",
    "fig : xvd ] ) . nevertheless , the conclusions of our simple derivation are not very different from those of a rigorous analysis including correlations and discreteness  @xcite .",
    "note that although a limiting distribution @xmath284 does not exist , the envelope functions @xmath285 and @xmath286 do exist .",
    "assuming that @xmath287 and @xmath288 are continuous ( although @xmath89 is not ) , it can be shown from ( [ eq : scalings ] ) that the envelope functions have the fisher - tippett form @xmath289 for some constants @xmath290 and that the variance is bounded on the scale of the crossover size @xmath291 .",
    "the latter result supports our assumption above in fitting the simulation data to ( [ eq : sigma_fit ] ) .",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed proof of ( [ eq : envelope ] ) , which follows the rg strategy outlined here .",
    "the heuristic arguments and simulation results in sections [ sec : simple ] and [ sec : numerical ] also lead us to conjecture that the `` envelope width '' @xmath292 is simply set by the `` strength '' of the discreteness , i.e. the ratio of the lattice cell volume ( @xmath293 ) to the crossover size @xmath294 which vanishes in the limit @xmath97 .",
    "in this article , a heuristic theory of the finite - size scaling of the largest - cluster size in subcritical percolation is presented and supported by numerical simulations .",
    "as expected away from a critical point , correlations are weak enough that a classical limiting distribution from the theory of extremes of independent random variables is recovered once the system size greatly exceeds the correlation length .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood via a cell - renormalization scheme , which also provides a suitable framework for rigorous analysis .",
