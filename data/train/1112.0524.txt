    "( [ ereq ] ) , @xmath177 \\frac{\\delta v_{\\rm c}}{v_{\\rm c } } \\,.\\ ] ]    since the differential event rate is given by an integral over the velocity distribution the differential event rate depends only weakly on the detailed form of the velocity distribution  @xcite .",
    "consequently the resulting uncertainty in exclusion limits  @xcite and determinations of the wimp mass  @xcite is usually fairly small .",
    "there are , however , some exceptions to this statement .",
    "firstly if the wimp is light and/or the experimental energy threshold is high compared with the characteristic energy , then only the high speed tail of the speed distribution is probed . in this case the uncertainties in its shape can have a significant effect on the expected energy spectrum and hence exclusions limits or allowed regions  @xcite .",
    "secondly if there is a dark disc there will be an additional population of low speed wimps .",
    "if the dark disc density is sufficiently high and its velocity dispersion sufficiently small this will significantly change the energy spectrum and hence exclusion limits and mass determinations  @xcite .",
    "the size of these changes depends on the properties of the dark disc , which are currently uncertain  @xcite . a wimp stream , with sufficiently high density ,",
    "would add a sloping step to the differential event rate  @xcite .",
    "the annual modulation arises from the , relatively small , shift in the speed distribution in the lab frame over the course of the year .",
    "it is therefore far more sensitive to the speed distribution than the time averaged energy spectrum .",
    "both the amplitude and phase of the modulation , and hence the regions of parameter space compatible with an observed signal , can vary significantly ( e.g. refs .  ) .    the uncertainty in the value of @xmath178 can change the amplitude by a factor of order unity , while the uncertainty in the shape of the halo velocity distribution changes the amplitude by @xmath179  @xcite .",
    "a high density dark disc could change the annual modulation signal significantly , producing a 2nd , low energy , maximum in the amplitude of the modulation and changing the phase significantly  @xcite . for",
    "a wimp stream the position and height of the step in the energy spectrum produced would vary annually ( e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the detailed direction dependence of the event rate is sensitive to the velocity distribution , however the anisotropy is robust  @xcite .",
    "the number of events required to detect anisotropy or to demonstrate that the median inverse recoil direction coincides with the direction of solar motion only vary by of order @xmath180  @xcite .    the features in the high speed tail can cause the median inverse direction of high energy recoils to deviate from the direction of solar motion  @xcite .",
    "a stream of wimps would produce recoils which are strongly peaked in the opposite direction  @xcite",
    ". in the long term , studying the median direction of high energy recoils could allow high speed features to be detected and the formation history of the milky way probed .",
    "it is possible to carry out an ` astrophysics independent ' comparison of data from multiple experiments .",
    "this effectively involves making comparisons of the energy spectra , so that the integral over the velocity distribution , @xmath181 defined in eq .",
    "( [ gvmin ] ) , cancels .",
    "for instance , with data from two different experiments using two different targets , the wimp mass can in principle be determined , without any assumptions about @xmath0 , by taking moments of the energy spectra  @xcite .",
    "however this method leads to a systematic underestimate of the wimp mass if it is comparable to or larger than the mass of the target nuclei .",
    "ref .  , see also ref .",
    ", showed how the differential event rates in two experiments , ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' with target nuclei with mass numbers @xmath182 and @xmath183 are related . if the first experiment is sensitive to recoil energies in the range @xmath184 $ ] it probes @xmath181 for @xmath185 , where @xmath125 is related to the recoil energy , wimp mass and target nuclei mass by eq .",
    "( [ vmin ] ) . in experiment 2",
    "these values of @xmath125 correspond to recoils in the range @xmath186 = \\frac{\\mu_{a2 \\chi}^2          m_{a1}}{\\mu_{a1 \\chi}^2 m_{a2 } } [ e_{1}^{\\rm low } , e_{1}^{\\rm          high } ] \\,.\\ ] ] for recoil energies in this range the differential event rates in the two experiments are then related by @xmath187 this relation depends on the ( unknown ) wimp mass , therefore the comparison has to be made separately for a range of @xmath188 values .",
    "this method has recently been extended to include annual modulation data  @xcite .",
    "this approach has proved particularly useful  @xcite in comparing the event rate excesses and annual modulations found in the cogent  @xcite , cresst  @xcite and dama  @xcite experiments with exclusions limits from cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite . ref",
    ".   found that the dama , cogent and cresst - ii data are compatible which each other , but not cdms and xenon , if the velocity distribution is very anisotropic ( which leads to a large modulation fraction ) .",
    "the astrophysics independent methods are invaluable for assessing the compatibility of data from different experiments .",
    "however the wimp mass is not a priori known , and the goal of wimp direct detection experiments is not just to detect wimps , but to also measure their mass and cross - section . while there are uncertainties in the velocity distribution it is not completely unknown , and therefore does not need to be completely removed from the analysis .",
    "strigari and trotta  @xcite have shown how the wimp properties can be constrained by a single future direct detection experiment when astronomical data ( such as the kinematics of halo stars ) are used to jointly constrain the wimp properties and the parameters of a model for the milky way halo .",
    "they assumed an isotropic maxwellian speed distribution characterised by the peak speed , @xmath12 , and the escape speed , @xmath189 .",
    "peter  @xcite has examined how data sets from multiple direct detection experiments could be used to jointly constrain a maxwellian parametrisation of the wimp speed distribution and the wimp parameters ( mass and cross - section ) .",
    "pato et al .",
    "@xcite have taken a similar approach using the parameterization in eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) .",
    "peter has recently extended this work by allowing the peak speed and circular speed to differ ( as expected if the density profile is not @xmath5 ) and also considering an empirical speed distribution consisting of a five or ten bin step function  @xcite .",
    "combining data from multiple experiments with different targets significantly increases the accuracy with which the wimp parameters can be measured  @xcite .",
    "however fixing the form of the speed distribution leads to biases in the wimp properties , if the true speed distribution differs significantly from the parameterization assumed  @xcite . with a suitable parameterization o the wimp parameters and speed distribution",
    "can be jointly probed  @xcite .",
    "the form of the optimal parameterization of the speed distribution is an open question .",
    "direct detection event rate calculations often assume the standard halo model , with an isotropic maxwellian velocity distribution with dispersion @xmath190 and a local wimp density @xmath191 .",
    "however it has long been realised  @xcite that uncertainties in the speed distribution will affect the signals expected in experiments .",
    "we have discussed the standard halo model and other approaches to halo modelling , and the assumptions behind them .",
    "we then reviewed observational determinations of quantities that are relevant to direct detection experiments , namely the local dark matter density , the local circular speed ( which is related to the velocity dispersion by the jeans equations ) and the local escape speed . while the statistical errors on these quantities are often small the systematic errors , from uncertainties in the modelling of the milky way , can be significantly larger .",
    "next we turned our attention to high resolution , dark matter only simulations of the formation of milky way - like halos in a cosmological context .",
    "they find velocity distributions that deviate significantly from the standard maxwellian , and have features at high speeds .",
    "the effect of baryonic physics on the dark matter distribution is not yet well understood .",
    "some recent simulations have found that a dark disc may be formed , however its properties ( and even existence ) are highly uncertain .",
    "simulations resolve the dark matter distribution on scales many orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments .",
    "the latest results suggest that the ultra - local dark matter distribution is largely smooth , but some features may exist .",
    "we then reviewed the resulting uncertainties in the energy , time and direction dependence of the energy spectrum , and hence constraints on , or measurements of , the wimp parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in the local circular speed has a significant effect on the event rate and hence exclusion limits and determinations of the wimp mass .",
    "the uncertainty in the local density leads directly to an uncertainty in measurements of , or constraints on , the cross - section .",
    "only the high energy tail of the energy spectrum is particularly sensitive to the exact shape of the speed distribution .",
    "the annual modulation is far more sensitive to the shape of the velocity distribution ; its amplitude and phase can change significantly .",
    "the anisotropy of the recoil rate is robust to changes in the velocity distribution , however high speed features can change the peak direction of high energy recoils , and hence provide a way of probing the formation of the milky way .",
    "finally we discussed techniques for handling the astrophysical uncertainties when analysing direct detection data .",
    "astrophysics independent comparisons between different experiments can be made using the integral of the velocity distribution , @xmath181 .",
    "this approach is extremely useful for assessing the compatibility of various experiments , but requires the wimp mass as input .",
    "parameterising the wimp speed distribution , and using data from multiple experiments to jointly constrain the wimp mass and cross - section and speed distribution is a promising approach , but the optimal form for the parameterisation is not yet known .",
