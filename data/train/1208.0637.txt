    "apparently , the fm half - metallic solution of sr@xmath3coo@xmath2 is due to the significant @xmath29 hybridization between the is co@xmath5 ions and the planar oxygens .",

    "this picture is indeed supported by our calculations , see fig .",
    "3 : the up - spin @xmath19@xmath20 bands both of the co@xmath5 and co@xmath14 ions are almost fully occupied but cross fermi level due to the @xmath19@xmath20 electron hopping and the strong planar @xmath29 hybridization .",

    "[ this spin - state transition is likely upon la doping into sr@xmath3coo@xmath2 , as the introduced hs co@xmath14 ions get bigger in size ( compared with the is co@xmath5 ions ) , and then a chemical pressure forces the is co@xmath5 ions transit into the lower - volume ls state . ] at a glance , an electron hopping from co@xmath14 to co@xmath5 is possible , as there could be no change of the electronic configurations ( from the initial @xmath48+@xmath49 state to the final @xmath49+@xmath48 state ) .",
    "however , as seen in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) , the @xmath19@xmath20 electron hopping from hs co@xmath14 to ls co@xmath5 is actually suppressed , particularly due to the spin - state issue .",

    ", the ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 state will be stabilized at it is , and it has no real electron hopping ( due to a spin blockade@xcite ) and is thus insulating .",
    "however , a virtual hopping of the @xmath19@xmath20 electron forth and back and the local hund exchange would mediate a superexchange fm in the @xmath50-@xmath51 configuration of the ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 state .",
    "la@xmath9coo@xmath2 in the ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 ground state calculated by gga+@xmath21 .",
    "it is fm semiconducting .",
    ", width=302 ]    the insulating but fm solution of the ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 state is indeed confirmed by our calculations , see fig .",
    "4 : it has a small insulating gap of about 0.3 ev . the co@xmath5 @xmath25 orbitals carry a spin=1/2 ( on the @xmath26 orbital ) , and the strong @xmath29 hybridization brings about a large amount of @xmath30 occupation and thus increases the local spin moment of the co@xmath5 to 1.7 @xmath33 , see table i. the ls co@xmath5 ion has a negligible orbital moment of 0.01 @xmath33 . for the co@xmath14 ion , co - o valency reduces its local spin moment to 2.88 @xmath33 .",
    "the total spin moment is 5 @xmath33/2fu as expected for this ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 ( @xmath34=1/2 plus @xmath34=2 ) state . in this semiconducting state , besides the localized @xmath25 and @xmath31@xmath32 orbitals , the @xmath19@xmath32 orbital also gets localized due to the spin blockade .",
    "then the formal hs co@xmath14 ion has the configuration state @xmath38@xmath52(@xmath27+@xmath40)@xmath41 , i.e. , the up - spin orbitals are fully occupied and form a closed subshell , but the rest single electron occupies the lowest crystal - field doublet @xmath27/@xmath28 . as a result , the spin - orbit coupling lifts the orbital degeneracy , produces the @xmath42 ( @xmath27+@xmath40 ) complex orbital , and gives a large orbital moment of 0.84 @xmath33 along the easy - magnetization @xmath17-axis .",
    "the importance of spin - orbit coupling was also demonstrated previously when studing the spin - orbital ground state of the perovskite lacoo@xmath53.@xcite thus , in sr@xmath8la@xmath9coo@xmath2 the total spin and orbital moments sum up to about 5.8 @xmath33/2fu .",
    "it is important to note that this ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 fm state is more stable than the above is - hs fm state by 139 mev / fu .",
    "in addition , this ls - hs state brings about a local distortion against the homogeneous co - o lattice measured so far in polycrystals .",
    "our calculations doing atomic relaxations show that the ls co@xmath5 ion has the optimized co - o bondlengths of 1.879   @xmath10 4 ( in plane ) and 2.011 ",
    "@xmath10 2 ( out of plane ) .",
    "the corresponding values are 1.911   @xmath10 4 and 2.061   @xmath10 2 for the hs co@xmath14 .",
    "such atomic relaxations help the ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 state gain further an elastic energy of 54 mev / fu as shown by our calculations .",
    "the semiconducting electronic structure turns out to have insignificant changes due to the atomic relaxations . for example , the local spin and orbital moments of the ls co@xmath5 ( the hs co@xmath14 ) are now 1.64 and 0.01 ( 2.92 and 0.83 ) @xmath33 , respectively ( see table i for a comparison ) .",

    "the ls - hs ferrimagnetic solution has a total spin moment of 3 @xmath33/2fu as expected .",
    "the constituent ls co@xmath5 ( @xmath34 = 1/2 ) has a local spin ( orbital ) moment of 0.42 ( 0.01 ) @xmath33 , and the hs co@xmath14 ( @xmath34 = 2 ) has 2.97 ( 0.84 ) @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , our calculations show that another possible spin state of sr@xmath8la@xmath9coo@xmath2the is co@xmath5-is co@xmath14 state is unstable and converges to the present ls - hs fm state .",
    "therefore , the present fm semiconducting ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 solution is the ground state of sr@xmath8la@xmath9coo@xmath2 .",
    "this fm semiconducting ground - state solution agrees with the experiments.@xcite moreover , using the ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 state ( @xmath34=@xmath54 and @xmath34=2 plus @xmath55=1 ) , we estimate the effective magnetic moment @xmath56=@xmath57 @xmath58 3.8 @xmath33/co . taking a covalency reduction ,",
    "this value is in good agreement with the measured one of 3.5 @xmath33.@xcite although the predicted magnetic moment of 2.9 @xmath33/fu ( i.e. , the above 5.8 @xmath33/2fu ) along the easy - magnetization @xmath17-axis ( of a single crystal , ideally ) is much bigger than the measured 1.5 @xmath33,@xcite using of the polycrystals so far in the experiments would most probably account for the large reduction .",
    "the predicted ls - hs state , a big orbital moment along the @xmath17-axis , and the local co - o distortions in sr@xmath8la@xmath9coo@xmath2 call for further studies on a single crystal .",
    "in summary , using gga+@xmath21 calculations , we find that while sr@xmath3coo@xmath2 in the co@xmath5 is ground state is a fm half - metal , sr@xmath8la@xmath9coo@xmath2 has the ls co@xmath5-hs co@xmath14 ground state .",
    "it is the co@xmath5 is - ls transition that suppresses an electron hopping via a spin blockade and thus drives a metal - insulator transition in sr@xmath8la@xmath9coo@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the present spin - state picture consistently accounts for the fm behavior of metallic sr@xmath3coo@xmath2 via a @xmath29 hybridization and that of semiconducting sr@xmath8la@xmath9coo@xmath2 via a superexchange .",
