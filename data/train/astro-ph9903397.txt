    "recent indications for neutrino masses @xcite have strengthened the interest in physical effects linked to massive neutrinos . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with one of these effects , namely , with the fact that massive neutrinos can have non  zero electromagnetic form factors and can be unstable due to radiative decay processes .",
    "specifically , we shall be interested in the contribution of decays @xmath0 , when coming from a cosmological @xmath1 density , to the cosmic photon background .",
    "a previous study of such phenomena was performed by ressell and turner @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these authors considered the photon background at different photon energies and constrained the radiative decay of a cosmic density of massive neutrinos .",

    "positron pairs , where one @xmath3 is a background infrared photon , and the other is a tev @xmath3 coming from an active galaxy .",
    "we may expect further improvements in the future , along the lines used in @xcite or perhaps with some new ideas and/or observations .",
    "constraints on the neutrino lifetime lead to limits on the magnetic and electric transition moments , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , of neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino lifetime @xmath6 is related to these parameters , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the branching ratio @xmath10 .",
    "all the studies performed until now make the simplifying assumptions that the decays are produced 1 ) in a critical matter dominated universe and 2 ) by neutrinos at rest .",
    "although this might be enough for the results obtained until now , in the future it may be interesting to study the contribution to the photon background with more generality . in a more general framework we can be able to see how the limits on the neutrino lifetime depend on different assumptions , and we can extract more precise and reliable bounds . also , in the eventual case of a positive signal that may come from decays of relic neutrinos , the general study of the consequences of the decay that we perform in the present paper would become quite necessary . apart from the above mentioned references , other papers treating unstable neutrinos in a cosmological context are listed in @xcite .",
    "non  vanishing values of @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 lead to other potential effects besides the ones considered in this paper . for example , plasmon decay into neutrinos in stellar media is constrained by arguments of stellar energy loss .",
    "this leads , in general , to limits that are quite stringent  @xcite .",

    "( [ b ] ) may be relevant since in this case @xmath11 . in any case , the spirit of the present paper is not phenomenological .",

    "this reflects the fact that when the lifetime @xmath6 is smaller than the age of the universe @xmath34 , most neutrinos have already decayed , and the energy of the photons produced in the decay has been redshifted to low values of @xmath20 .",
