    "polarization gating , since being proposed in the mid 1990s @xcite , has turned into a powerful tool for attosecond metrology , and dynamic imaging of matter @xcite , mainly due to its simplicity and reliability . the key idea behind it is to combine laser fields of different polarizations and sometimes frequencies in such a way as to obtain controllable , near - linearly polarized , extremely short driving laser pulses .",
    "an important application of this technique is , for instance , the generation of isolated attosecond pulses @xcite , some of them as short as 130 attoseconds @xcite .",
    "the latter pulses have been accomplished by employing , as a driving field , a left circularly polarized and a time - delayed right circularly polarized sub-10fs laser pulse .",
    "the resulting driving pulse changes from circularly polarized to almost linearly polarized , and then back to circularly polarized , within the pulse envelope .",
    "the importance of these drastic ellipticity changes is a consequence of the physical mechanism behind high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) .",
    "this phenomenon , which is employed in the generation of attosecond pulses , is the result of a three - step physical process @xcite . thereby , the valence electron of an atom , subjected to an intense laser field , is released in the continuum by tunnel ionization . this electron",
    "is then accelerated by the field and , depending on its energy , ionization time and on the laser - field polarization , it may be driven back towards its parent ion and recombine at a later instant . upon recombination",
    ", the energy acquired by the electron from the field is released as a high - frequency photon .",
    "gating is important , as it may be employed to restrict the electron ionization and recombination times to very narrow intervals .",
    "if the field is circularly polarized , the returning electron will miss the atomic core , whereas , if the field is linearly polarized , the electron will interact with it .",
    "laser - induced nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) is also caused by a similar mechanism .",
    "the main difference lies on the fact that the returning electron , instead of recombining with a bound state of its parent ion , will rescatter inelastically with it , giving part of its kinetic energy to release a second electron .",
    "this nonsequential physical mechanism has been revealed by very peculiar features in the electron momentum distributions , namely symmetric peaks at the nonvanishing momenta @xmath1 @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the ponderomotive energy and @xmath4 the electron momentum components parallel to the laser field polarization @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that nsdi may also be strongly influenced by the time dependence of the external laser field , for example , by the dramatic change of its amplitude and polarization .",
    "this is supported by our previous work on nsdi with few - cycle , linearly polarized driving pulses @xcite .",
    "therein , we have shown , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that the nsdi dynamics are strongly dependent on the carrier - envelope ( ce ) phase . indeed , we observed strongly asymmetric distributions , which would shift from the positive to the negative region , or vice versa , of the plane @xmath5 spanned by the electron momentum components @xmath6 parallel to the laser - field polarization , as the ce phase was changed .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown , for nsdi with a single elliptically polarized driving field , that the electron - momentum distributions are highly dependent on the driving - field polarization @xcite .",
    "hence , one can raise the question of whether polarization gating may be used to control nsdi dynamics .",
    "this issue is of interest for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , since one may build an extremely short , almost linearly polarized driving field , it may be possible to steer the electron motion with a much higher precision than with , for instance , linearly polarized few - cycle pulses .",
    "secondly , sometimes the changes observed in the nsdi electron momentum distributions , with regard to the driving - field shape , are far more dramatic than in high - order harmonic or above - threshold ionization spectra .",
    "this is due to the fact that different sets of electron orbits may be mapped into different momentum regions .",
    "apart from that , if the second electron is dislodged by electron - impact ionization , there will be a minimum and a maximum parallel momentum for which this process is classically allowed .",
    "depending on the field parameters , we can employ this particular feature to make whole momentum regions appear or collapse .",
    "the above - stated effects have been observed for nsdi with linearly polarized few cycle pulses , and led to dramatic changes in the electron momentum distributions @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate differential electron momentum distributions in nsdi with polarization gating . for that purpose , we extend the classical model employed in our previous publications @xcite to the elliptical - polarization case . in this model , the quantum - mechanical transition probability corresponding to the scenario in which the second electron is released by electron - impact ionization , within the strong - field approximation , is mimicked by a classical ensemble of electrons released in the continuum with a quasi - static tunneling rate @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that , for elliptically polarized fields , one must take into account that the lateral residual laser electric field influences the electron orbits in the continuum , and also at the instant of ionization . as the external driving field , we consider the same pulse configuration as in @xcite , i.e. , two counter - rotating , time - delayed circularly polarized few - cycle pulses .",
    "we investigate the influence of both the ce phase and of the delay between the two pulses on the electron momentum distributions . in a more general context",
    ", it is worth mentioning that classical models have proven to be very powerful in the context of nonsequential double @xcite or multiple @xcite ionization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we provide a brief discussion of our model , placing a particular emphasis on how it differs from its counterpart for linearly polarized fields .",
    "subsequently ( sec . [ results ] ) , we present the differential electron momentum distributions , and analyze their main features in terms of electron trajectories . finally , our conclusions and a summary of this work are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider an electron ensemble subject to a pulse with a time - dependent ellipticity , which is generated by the superposition of a left - circularly polarized pulse , and right - circularly polarized pulse .",
    "the two pulses are taken to be identical except by their polarization , and there is a time delay @xmath0 between them .",
    "below , we provide more details about the pulse shape , and our classical ensemble model , which is employed to imitate the behavior of a quantum - mechanical wave packet .",

    ", this approximation does not hold .",
    "the temporal region for which the field polarization is approximately linear is known as the  polarization gate \" @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the polarization gate for the specific laser - field configuration discussed above has been estimated to be around @xmath24 .",
    "therein , it has also been shown that it is inversely proportional to the time delay @xmath0 between the two pulses .",
    "hence , to reduce the polarization gate , we can either use shorter circularly polarized pulses or increase @xmath0 . from the experimental perspective , either of them",
    "can be controlled at will .",
    "in fact , the length of the laser pulse will be conditioned by state - of - the - art ultrafast laser technique @xcite .",
    "however , the delay time between the two circularly polarized laser pulses can not be too long .",
    "if we use a too long delay between the two circularly polarized laser pulses , to obtain a sufficiently intense combined pulse it may be necessary to strengthen our laser pulses so much that the ground - state sample may be depleted and result in a poor signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we will now discuss how we mimic the quantum - mechanical electron momentum distributions in a classical framework .",
    "similar models have been employed in @xcite for linearly polarized fields .",
    "we consider a set of classical trajectories , starting at different tunneling times @xmath25 throughout the pulse .",
    "we limit such times to the time interval for which the field is almost linearly polarized .",
    "this is justified , as , only in this time range , a significant contribution to nsdi will occur .",
    "furthermore , in the specific model discussed in this paper , we make three main assumptions .",
    "first , each trajectory is weighted with the tunneling probability per unit time given by the well - known quasi - static formula @xcite",

    "second , to simulate the initial wave - packet spreading , an initial lateral velocity @xmath30 is further introduced . each trajectory is then weighted with the tunneling probability times the quantum - mechanical transverse velocity distribution weight @xcite , @xmath31 , which can be calculated by @xmath32 , \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] where the lateral velocity width is given by @xmath33 the range for the transverse velocity distribution chosen here is @xmath34 .",
    "finally , a quantum - mechanical wave packet also spreads in time , so that the contributions of the longer orbits are weakened .",
    "we incorporate this final ingredient in a similar way as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by introducing an extra weight @xmath35 to each electron trajectory .",
    "thereby , @xmath36 denotes the time the electron returned to the core .",
    "therefore , the overall weight of each trajectory in the ensemble reads @xmath37 after tunneling , the equations of motion for the electron in both directions are @xmath38@xmath39 in order to obtain the electron orbits , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) are integrated , and the coulomb potential is ignored .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for a strong driving field .",
    "electrons are assumed to be ` born ' at time @xmath25 at the origin @xmath40 with initial lateral velocity",
    ". only those electrons coming back to the core with energy larger than @xmath41 , the second ionization threshold of the atom , will contribute to the nsdi yield .",
    "this corresponds to the physical situation in which the first electron dislodges the second by electron - impact ionization .",
    "after a trajectory is launched , by checking the position of the electron , we determine whether it has returned to the core , and , if so , its return time .",
    "the electron velocities in both directions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are then evaluated .",

    "one should note that the energy - conservation condition ( eq . ( [ eq13 ] ) ) gives the equation of a hypersphere in the six - dimensional space spanned by the momentum components of the two electrons .",

    "the electron momentum distributions are mainly determined by the momentum - space integration .",
    "this means that they are isotropic in momentum space , have the radius of the above - mentioned hypersphere , and are centered at the most probable momentum upon return .",

    "this sharp contrast persists for the other values of ce phases .",

    "in this latter case , the distributions are nearly symmetric and the information about the ce phase is almost lost .",
    "this result is rather counterintuitive , as it resembles more the distributions obtained for a linearly monochromatic driving field than what is expected for a combination of two few - cycle pulses . in the former case ,",
    "the distributions are totally symmetric upon @xmath89 . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we observe that this symmetry holds in practice if the pulse is longer than 10 cycles .",
    "however , the longest quasi - linearly polarized pulse considered here has no more than 4 cycles , as the gate width must be less than the laser - pulse duration .",

    "the contributions of this latter pair are weaker , and localized in the third quadrant of the plane @xmath79 .",
    "finally , as an overall feature , there is an increase in the adk rate and also in the recollision rate for the first electron .",
    "this is due to an increase in the overlap between the two pulses @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and leads to brighter distributions .",
    "all the above - stated features can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .    a further reduction in the delay phase to @xmath87 leads to an additional set @xmath104 of orbits for which the first electron may return and release the second electron .",
    "this set starts near @xmath120 , and leads to contributions in the first quadrant of the plane @xmath79 .",
    "this will add up to the contributions from the orbits @xmath103 .",
    "hence , overall , there will be two sets of orbits yielding momenta in such a region .",
    "the ionization and recollision rates , however , are larger for the orbits @xmath102 starting at @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the distributions are slightly brighter in the negative momentum region .",
    "finally , for @xmath122 , there are four sets of orbits contributing to the electron - momentum distributions , and the distributions are approximately symmetric .    .",
    "the tabs , ( a),(b),(c),(d ) , follow those in fig .",
    "the numbers @xmath123 in the upper panel denote the orbits composing a pair.,width=480 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we display the initial lateral velocity for the rescattering orbits ( upper panel ) and the lateral laser electric field ( lower panel ) , as functions of the initial electric field phase @xmath95 .",
    "classically , for a linearly polarized driving electric field , an electron with a large lateral initial velocity will miss the core .",
    "for an elliptically polarized field , however , the lateral electric field will also slightly change the electron s orbit in the transverse direction .",
    "if both effects are combined , a gate can be formed to choose the orbit with a certain initial lateral velocity to come back with highest probability @xcite .",
    "a larger lateral velocity corresponds to a stronger lateral laser electric field and , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , to a lower ionization rate . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the orbits starting near @xmath114 meet the smallest lateral laser electric field because their tunneling phases are those nearest to the center of the gate .",
    "hence , these orbits exhibit the largest recollision probability .",
    "this explains why we observe a favored nsdi rate in this region in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "it is also noteworthy that this specific set of orbits exhibits lateral velocities close to zero , whereas the lateral velocities of the remaining sets vary considerably with the time delay . in general , as the delay phase @xmath124 decreases , the lateral velocities diminish as well .",
    "this causes an overall increase in the tunneling and recollision rates , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    apart from that , specifically for the time delay @xmath88 , there is an overall decrease in the lateral velocities for the orbits starting near @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "both sets of orbits lead to positive final momenta @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we will expect an increase in brightness in the first quadrant of the @xmath5 plane . as a direct consequence , the distributions are nearly symmetric .",
    "the set of orbits @xmath104 , starting near @xmath127 , exhibit very large transverse velocities and therefore does not contribute significantly to the yield .     and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "the ce phase is fixed to be @xmath86 and the delay phases , from left to right , are @xmath85 [ panels ( a ) and ( f ) ] , @xmath129 [ panels ( b ) and ( g ) ] , @xmath130 [ panels ( c ) and ( h ) ] , @xmath131 [ panels ( d ) and ( i ) ] and @xmath91 [ panels ( e ) and ( j ) ] .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1].,width=576 ]     ( panel ( iii ) ) , as functions of the phase @xmath95 , for a pulse described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , with ce phase of @xmath86 and three different phase delays of @xmath84 , @xmath130 and @xmath91[tags ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ] .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1].,width=480 ]    still , one remaining question is how to understand the dramatic change in the electron momentum distributions between the delay phase of @xmath85 and @xmath91 , as shown in fig .",
    "for that purpose , we further conduct the calculations for the ce phase @xmath77 and several delay phases between @xmath85 and @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath132 and @xmath131 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ pd_odddelay ] .",
    "in addition to the momentum components @xmath133 in the x direction , we also consider the momentum components @xmath128 .",
    "the distributions as functions of the former or latter momentum components are displayed in the upper and lower panels of the figure , respectively .",
    "therefore , for the sake of clarity , we are no longer employing the notation @xmath134 .",
    "it is found that , actually , the electron momentum distributions evolve gradually from the third quadrant to the first quadrant , with the decrease of the delay phase between @xmath85 and @xmath91 . and interestingly , at a delay phase of @xmath130 , the electron distribution is almost centered at the origin ( fig .",
    "[ pd_odddelay](c ) ) .",
    "this is quite different from the case with a linearly polarized few - cycle pulse , for which the center of the electron momentum distribution is always at nonvanishing momenta and the distributions just  jump \" from one quadrant to another .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the linearly - polarized , few - cycle case , the  jump \" is caused by a shift in the dominant set of orbits , while , in the present situation , the dominant set of trajectories remains the same .",
    "the changes occur in the momentum components in the x direction .",
    "this modification in the most probable momenta is due to the fact that the polarization gate changes direction within this phase - delay interval .",
    "in fact , as the x momentum components @xmath135 decrease , there is a corresponding increase in the momentum components @xmath136 .",
    "this is explicitly shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ pd_odddelay ] , which exhibit exactly the opposite behavior as in the upper panel , i.e. , an increase in the peak momenta of the distributions as @xmath105 is shifted from @xmath85 to @xmath130 , followed by a decrease when this delay is further shifted to @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , while for figs .  [ pd_odddelay](f ) and [ pd_odddelay](j ) the distributions exhibit a peak near @xmath137 , in the central panel [ fig .  [ pd_odddelay](h ) ]",
    "the absolute value of the peak momentum is near @xmath138 .    in order to understand this more clearly , we plot in fig .",
    "[ frandps_odddelay ] the laser electric field in the x direction , the recollision rate and the final electron momentum along @xmath139 as functions of the phase @xmath95 , for three different delay phases of @xmath84 , @xmath130 and @xmath91 . from the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ frandps_odddelay ] , one finds that , for @xmath140 , the field amplitude in the x direction is very small around the center of the gate , because the two combining field components in x direction are totally out of phase .",
    "while for @xmath84 and @xmath91 , the fields have maximal amplitudes but opposite directions due to their relative phase shift of @xmath141 .    as discussed in section [ model ] , the center of the hypersphere which delimits the momentum distributions in momentum space is determined by the vector potential - component @xmath48 at the instant when the electron recollides . for @xmath140 ,",
    "the amount of momentum the electron acquired from the combined field is thus very small in the x direction .",
    "hence , the classically allowed region is approximately centered at momentum @xmath142 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ frandps_odddelay](iii ) . for @xmath84 and @xmath91 , the relative shift of @xmath74 in the delay phase results in the inversion of the x - component of the combined field at the very center of the polarization gate .",
    "this gives rise to electron emission in the opposite direction , i.e. , the electron momentum distribution shifts from the third to the first quadrant .",
    "in this work , we have studied laser - induced nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) with a polarization - gated driving pulse . the specific pulse employed here consisted of two few - cycle pulses with opposite circular polarizations and a time delay @xmath0 ( for details we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "the ellipticity of the combined field is time - dependent and vanishes for @xmath143 . the larger the time delay between both pulses , the steeper the time - dependence in the polarization .",
    "we performed such studies within a classical framework , extending the model in ref .",
    "@xcite to elliptically polarized fields .",
    "we found that the electron - momentum distributions , as functions of the electron components parallel to the laser - field polarization at the center of the gate , are very much dependent on the delay between the two few - cycle pulses @xmath118 and @xmath119 composing the polarization - gated pulse . for long delays that are chosen as multiple times of the pulse duration ,",
    "the distributions are asymmetric and dependent on the ce phase of such pulses .",
    "this is similar to the behavior observed for a single linearly polarized , few - cycle driving pulse @xcite .",
    "as the time delay @xmath144 decreases , this asymmetry fades .",
    "we could explain this behavior in terms of trajectories .",
    "below we will summarize the main aspects of this explanation , and also draw a parallel between the present situation and the previously studied case of linearly polarized , few - cycle pulses @xcite .    for linearly polarized few cycle pulses",
    ", the momentum region in which the electron momentum distributions will be concentrated depends on the quasi - static tunneling rate for the first electron and on the momentum region for which nsdi is classically allowed .",
    "a large rate and a large momentum region imply that the contributions from a specific set of trajectories to the distributions will be prominent .",
    "for very short pulses , there is in general a single set of trajectories that best fulfills such conditions .",
    "this set will change with the ce phase . as the pulse length increases , more and more sets of trajectories will lead to prominent contributions , and",
    "the asymmetry will fade .    for polarization gated pulses , the most relevant set of orbits will be that closest to the polarization gate , i.e. , to the quasi linearly polarized region of the pulse .",
    "indeed , the first electron will tunnel more efficiently than for the remaining set of orbits .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electron velocity components perpendicular to the main polarization axis of the laser field is smallest for the dominant set of orbits .",
    "apart from that , the first electron will return more easily to the parent ion if it was released near the polarization gate .",
    "this will happen for two main reasons .",
    "first , the small lateral velocity components will not lead to a significant initial motion in the transverse direction .",
    "second , the electron will propagate in the continuum in a time interval close to the gate .",
    "hence , it will be accelerated in the transverse direction to a lesser extent than for the remaining sets of orbits .",
    "this will guarantee an efficient return to the ion .",
    "for an efficient polarization gate , the changes in the driving - field ellipticity within the pulse length are very steep , so that only the orbits close to the gate will contribute significantly to the distributions . in general",
    ", this will lead to highly asymmetric electron momentum distributions , concentrated in the momentum region determined by the dominant orbits .",
    "this is a similar behavior to that encountered for linearly polarized driving fields , in the sense that , in general , only one set of trajectories dominates the yield .",
    "if the gate , however , is less efficient , the contributions from the other sets of orbits will be increasingly important . ultimately , this will lead to nearly symmetric electron - momentum distributions .",
    "for the specific driving pulse in this work , this effect has been observed by decreasing the delay @xmath0 between the pulses .    in general , the efficient use of polarization gates could tremendously increase the degree of attainable control of strong field ionization dynamics , compared to the commonly used single linearly polarized few - cycle pulse . for the latter ,",
    "only the scalar properties of laser pulses is used , while a polarization gate can , in principle , as demonstrated in this work , make full use of the flexibility of the vectorial laser field , e.g. , the polarization state , as an additional knob , to steer the nsdi dynamics within sub - cycle time resolution .",
