    "separatrix chaotic layers ( scls ) play a fundamental role for hamiltonian chaos and may be important in a broad variety of subjects in physics and astronomy @xcite .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of the layer is its width in energy or in related quantities",
    ". it can be easily found _ numerically _ by means of integration of the hamiltonian equations with a set of initial conditions in the vicinity of the separatrix .",
    "but it is important also to be able to find it _",
    "theoretically_. there is a long and rich history of the corresponding studies . the results may be classified as follows .    *",
    "1 . heuristic analytic results . *    consider a 1d hamiltonian system perturbed by a weak time - periodic perturbation :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 possesses a separatrix and , for the sake of notation compactness , all relevant parameters of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , except possibly @xmath4 , are assumed to be @xmath5 .",
    "there were a few heuristic criteria set by physicists ( see e.g. @xcite ) which gave qualitatively similar results for the scl width @xmath6 in terms of energy @xmath7 :    @xmath8    the quantity @xmath9 is called the _ separatrix split _ @xcite ( see also eq .",
    "( 4 ) below ) : it determines the maximum distance between the perturbed incoming and outgoing separatrices @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( 2 ) that the maximum of @xmath6 lies in the frequency range @xmath10 while the maximum itself is @xmath11 :    @xmath12    * 2",
    ". mathematical and accurate physical results .",
    "*    many papers studied the scl by mathematical and accurate physical methods . for the range @xmath13 ,",
    "there were many works studying the separatrix splitting ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) and the scl width in terms of the normal coordinates ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "though quantities studied in these works typically differ from those studied by physicists @xcite , they implicitly confirm the main qualitative conclusion from the heuristic formula ( 2 ) in the high frequency range : if @xmath13 the scl width is exponentially small .",
    "there were also several works studying the scl in the opposite ( i.e. adiabatic ) limit @xmath14 : see e.g. and references therein . in the context of the scl width , it is most important that @xmath15 for most of the systems . for a particular class of systems , namely for ac - driven spatially periodic systems ( e.g. the ac - driven pendulum ) , the width of the scl part above the separatrix diverges in the adiabatic limit @xcite : the divergence develops for @xmath16 .    finally , there is a qualitative estimation of the scl width for the range @xmath10 within the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory @xcite while the quantitative estimation within the kam theory appears to be very difficult for this frequency range @xcite .",
    "it follows from the results in @xcite that the width in this range is of the order of the separatratrix split while the latter is of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , from the above results , it could seem to follow that , for all systems except the ac - driven spatially periodic systems , the maximum of the scl width is @xmath18 and occurs in the range @xmath10 , quite in agreement with the heuristic result ( 3 ) . even for",
    "the ac - driven spatially periodic systems , this conclusion could seem to apply to the width of the scl part below the separatrix , for the whole frequency range , and to the width of the scl part above the separatrix , for @xmath19 .    *",
    "3 . numerical evidences of high peaks in @xmath20 and their rough estimates .",
    "*    the above conclusion does not agree with several numerical studies carried out during the last decade ( see e.g. @xcite ) which have revealed the existence of sharp peaks in @xmath20 in the frequency range @xmath21 the heights of which greatly exceed @xmath17 ( see also figs . 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 below ) .",
    "thus , the peaks represent the general _ dominant feature _ of the function @xmath20 .",
    "the peaks were related by the authors of @xcite to the absorption of nonlinear resonances by the scl . for some partial case ,",
    "rough analytic estimates for the position and magnitude of the peaks were made in @xcite .",
    "approach to an accurate description of the peaks .",
    "*    accurate analytic estimates for the peaks were lacking .",
    "it is explicitly stated in the review @xcite that the search for the mechanism of the involvement of resonances into the separatrix chaos and an accurate analytic description of the peaks are being among the most important and challenging tasks in the study of separatrix chaos .",
    "the first step towards this accomplishment was done in the recent papers @xcite , where a new approach to the theoretical treatment of the separatrix chaos for the relevant frequency range was developed and applied to the problem of the onset of global chaos between two close separatrices .",
    "an application of the approach to the , more common , single - separatrix cases was only discussed in @xcite .",
    "the _ present _ paper formulates the basic ideas of the approach in terms more general than @xcite and , on the basis of this approach , develops the _ first ever _ accurate theoretical description of the peaks i.e. of the scl width as a function of frequency in the range of the _ maximum _ of the width , which is the most important range from the physical point of view .",
    "in particular , we show that the maximal width of the separatrix chaotic layer may be much larger than it was assumed before . in the latter context",
    ", all systems are classified by us into two different types : for systems of type i , the ratio between the maximal width and the perturbation amplitude @xmath17 _ logarithmically diverges _ in the asymptotic limit @xmath22 while , for systems of type ii , it asymptotically approaches a _ constant _ ( still large , typically ) .    though the form of our treatment differs from typical forms of mathematical theorems in this subject ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the results yield the _ exact _ leading - order term in the asymptotic expansion of the width in the parameter of smallness @xmath23 .",
    "our theory is in excellent agreement with the results of numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "ii describes the basic ideas of the approach .",
    "iii presents the classification into two types of systems , using rough estimates .",
    "iv develops the leading - order asymptotic theory for an archetypal example of type i and compares it with the numerical integration of hamiltonian equations of motion .",
    "v develops the leading - order asymptotic theory for two archetypal examples of type ii and compares it with the numerical integration .",
    "next - order corrections are estimated in sec .",
    "discussion of a few other issues , including in particular an application to the global chaos onset , is presented in sec .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the new approach , which is developed in @xcite and here , may be briefly formulated as the matching between the discrete chaotic dynamics of the separatrix map in the immediate vicinity of the separatrix and the continuous regular - like dynamics of the resonance hamiltonian beyond the close vicinity of the separatrix .",
    "the present section describes the general features of the approach in more details .",
    "the motion near the separatrix may be approximated by the _ separatrix map _ ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "it was introduced for the first time in @xcite and its various modifications were used in many studies afterwards , sometimes being called as the _ whisker map_. it was re - derived in @xcite rigorously , as the leading - order approximation of the motion near the separatrix in the asymptotic limit @xmath22 , and an estimate of the errors was carried out too ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we remind the main ideas which allow one to introduce the sm @xcite . for",
    "the sake of simplicity , let us consider a perturbation @xmath3 that does not depend on the momentum : @xmath24 . a system with an energy close to the separatrix value spends most of the time in the vicinity of the saddle(s ) , where the velocity is exponentially small .",
    "differentiating @xmath7 with respect to time and allowing for the equations of motion of the system ( 1 ) , we can show that @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the perturbation can significantly change the energy only when the velocity is not small i.e. during the relatively short intervals while the system is away from the saddle(s ) : these intervals correspond to _ pulses _ of velocity as a function of time .",
    "consequently , it is possible to approximate the continuous hamiltonian dynamics by a discrete dynamics which maps the energy @xmath26 , the perturbation angle @xmath27 and the velocity sign @xmath28 from pulse to pulse .",
    "the actual form of the sm may vary , depending on the system under study , but its features , relevant in the present context , are similar for all systems . for",
    "the sake of clarity , let us consider the explicit case when the separatrix of @xmath1 possesses a single saddle and two symmetric loops while @xmath29 .",
    "then the sm reads @xcite : @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the separatrix energy , @xmath32 is the frequency of oscillation with energy @xmath26 in the unperturbed case ( i.e. for @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 is the instant corresponding to the @xmath35-th turning point in the trajectory @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is an arbitrary value from the range of time intervals which greatly exceed the characteristic duration of the velocity pulse while being much smaller than the interval between the subsequent pulses @xcite .",
    "consider the two most general ideas of our approach .",
    "if a trajectory of the sm includes a state with @xmath38 and an arbitrary @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then this trajectory is chaotic .",
    "* indeed , the angle @xmath39 of such a state is not correlated with the angle of the state at the previous step of the map , due to the divergence of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the angle at the previous step may deviate from a multiple of @xmath42 by an arbitrary value and , hence , the energy of the state at the previous step may deviate from @xmath31 by an arbitrary value within the interval @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the velocity sign @xmath40 is not correlated with that at the previous step either @xcite .",
    "given that a regular trajectory of the sm can not include a step where all three variables of the sm change random - like , we conclude that such a trajectory is chaotic .",
    "though the above arguments appear to be obvious , they may not be considered as a mathematically rigorous proof , so that the statement about the chaotic nature of the sm trajectory which includes any state with @xmath38 should be considered as a conjecture supported by the above arguments and by the results of the numerical iteration of the sm .",
    "possibly , the mathematically rigorous proof should involve an analysis of the lyapunov exponents for the sm ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) but this appears to be a technically difficult problem .",
    "we emphasize however that the rigorous proof of the conjecture is not crucial for the validity of the main results of the present paper , namely of the _ leading _ terms in the asymptotic expressions describing the peaks of the scl width as a function of the perturbation frequency .",
    "it will be obvious from the next item that in order to derive the leading term it is sufficient to know that the chaotic trajectory does visit areas of the phase space where the energy deviates from the separatrix by values of the order of the separatrix split @xmath44 , which is a widely accepted fact @xcite .",
    "as well known @xcite , at the leading - order approximation the frequency of eigenoscillation as function of the energy near the separatrix is proportional to the reciprocal of the logarithmic factor    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the energy of the stable states .    given that the argument of the logarithm is large in the relevant range of @xmath26 , the function @xmath47 is nearly constant for a substantial variation of the argument .",
    "therefore , * as the sm maps the state @xmath48 onto the state with @xmath49 , the value of @xmath32 for the given @xmath50 is nearly the same for most of the angles @xmath51 ( except in the close vicinity of multiples of @xmath52 ) * , namely    @xmath53    moreover , if the deviation of the sm trajectory from the separatrix increases further , @xmath32 remains close to @xmath54 provided the deviation is not too large , namely if @xmath55 . if @xmath56 , then the evolution of the sm ( 4 ) may be regular - like for a long time until the energy returns to the close vicinity of the separatrix , where the trajectory is chaotized .",
    "such a behavior is especially pronounced if the perturbation frequency is close to @xmath57 or @xmath58 or to one of their multiples of relatively low order : the resonance between the perturbation and the eigenoscillation gives rise to an accumulation of energy changes for many steps of the sm , which results in a deviation of @xmath26 from @xmath31 that greatly exceeds the separatrix split @xmath59 .",
    "consider a state at the boundary of the scl .",
    "the deviation of energy of such a state from @xmath31 depends on its position at the boundary . in turn , the maximum deviation is a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the latter function possesses the absolute maximum at @xmath4 close to @xmath57 or @xmath58 typically @xcite , for the upper or lower boundary of the scl respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the absorption of the , respectively upper and lower , 1st - order nonlinear resonance by the scl .",
    "the above intuitive idea has been explicitly confirmed in @xcite : it has been shown in the appendix of @xcite that , in the relevant range of energies , the separatrix map can be reduced to the system of two differential equations which are indentical to the equations of motion of the auxiliary resonance hamiltonian which describes the resonance dynamics in terms of the conventional canonically conjugate slow variables , action @xmath60 and slow angle @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the angle variable @xcite ( see eq . ( 16 ) below ) while @xmath63 is the relevant resonance number i.e. the integer number closest to the ratio @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the result of the matching between the discrete chaotic dynamics of the sm and the continuous regular - like dynamics of the resonance hamiltonian is the following @xcite .",
    "after the chaotic trajectory of the sm visits any state on the separatrix , the system transits in one step of the sm to a given upper or lower curve in the @xmath65 plane which has been labelled @xcite respectively upper or lower _ generalized separatrix split _ ( gss ) curve @xcite :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the conventional separatrix split @xcite while @xmath68 is the amplitude of the melnikov - like integral defined in eq . ( 4 ) above ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the angle @xmath69 may take any value from one of the two ranges : either @xmath70 $ ] or @xmath71 $ ] @xcite .",
    "after that , because of the closeness of @xmath4 to the @xmath63-th harmonic of @xmath32 in the relevant range of @xmath26 @xcite , for a relatively long time the system follows the _ nonlinear resonance _ ( nr ) dynamics ( see eq .",
    "( 16 ) below ) , during which the deviation of the energy from the separatrix value grows , greatly exceeding @xmath67 for most of the trajectory . as time goes on , @xmath69 is moving and , at some point , the deviation in energy from the separatrix value begins to decrease .",
    "this decrease lasts until the system hits the gss curve , after which it returns to the separatrix just for one step of the separatrix map . at the separatrix ,",
    "the slow angle @xmath69 is chaotized , so that a new stage of evolution similar to the one just described occurs , i.e. the nonlinear resonance dynamics starting from the gss curve with a new ( random ) value of @xmath69 .    of course",
    ", the sm can not describe the variation of the energy during the velocity pulses ( i.e. in between instants relevant to the sm ) : in some cases this variation can be comparable with the change within the sm dynamics .",
    "this additional variation will be taken into account below , where relevant ( see sec .",
    "v below ) .",
    "one might argue that , even for the instants relevant to the sm , the sm describes the original hamiltonian dynamics only approximately @xcite and may therefore miss some fine details of the motion : for example , the above picture does not include small windows of stability on the very separatrix .",
    "however these fine details are irrelevant in the present context , in particular the relative portion of the windows of stability on the separatrix apparently vanishes in the asymptotic limit @xmath22 .",
    "the boundary of the sm chaotic layer is formed by those parts of the sm chaotic trajectory which deviate from the separatrix more than others . as follows from the structure of the chaotic trajectory described above",
    ", the upper / lower boundary of the sm chaotic layer is formed in one of the two following ways @xcite : 1 ) if there exists a _",
    "self - intersecting _ resonance trajectory ( in other words , the resonance separatrix ) the lower / upper part of which ( i.e. the part situated below / above the self - intersection ) touches or intersects the upper / lower gss curve while the upper / lower part does not , then the upper / lower boundary of the layer is formed by the upper / lower part of this self - intersecting trajectory ( figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) ) ; 2 ) otherwise the boundary is formed by the resonance trajectory _",
    "tangent _ to the gss curve ( fig .",
    "it is shown below that , in both cases , the variation of the energy along the resonance trajectory is larger than the separatrix split @xmath67 by a logarithmically large factor @xmath72 . therefore , over the boundary of the sm chaotic layer the largest deviation of the energy from the separatrix value , @xmath73 , may be taken , in the leading - order approximation , to be equal to the largest variation of the energy along the resonance trajectory forming the boundary , while the latter trajectory can be entirely described within the resonance hamiltonian formalism .",
    "finally , we mention in this section that , as obvious from the above description of the boundary , @xmath74 possesses a local maximum @xmath75 at @xmath4 for which the resonance separatrix just _ touches _ the corresponding gss curve ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) .    0.2 cm 0.2 cm 0.2 cm",
    "as obvious from sec .",
    "ii above , @xmath76 is equal , in the leading order , to the width @xmath77 of the nonlinear resonance which touches the separatrix",
    ". let us make a rough estimate of @xmath77 : it will turn out that it is possible to classify all systems into two different types . with this aim , we expand the perturbation @xmath3 into a fourier series in @xmath78 and a fourier series in @xmath62 :    @xmath79    as in the standard theory of a nonlinear resonance @xcite , let us single out the relevant @xmath80 for a given peak , and denote its absolute value by @xmath81 :    @xmath82    let us now roughly estimate the width of the resonance",
    ", using the pendulum approximation of the resonance dynamics @xcite :    @xmath83    of course , this approximation assumes the constancy of @xmath84 in the resonance range of energies , while it is not so in our case : @xmath85 in the vicinity of the separatrix @xcite , so that the relevant derivative @xmath86 strongly varies within the resonance range .",
    "however , for our rough estimate we may use the maximal value of @xmath87 , which is equal to @xmath77 approximately . if @xmath4 is of the order of @xmath88 , then eq .",
    "( 10 ) reduces to the following rough asymptotic equation for @xmath77 :    @xmath89    the asymptotic solution of eq . ( 11 ) essentially depends on @xmath90 as a function of @xmath77 . in this context",
    ", all systems can be divided in the following two types .",
    "* type i*. the separatrix of the unperturbed system has _ two or more _ saddles while the relevant fourier coefficient @xmath91 possesses _ different _ values on adjacent saddles .",
    "given that , for @xmath92 , the system stays most of time near one of the saddles , the coefficient @xmath93 as a function of @xmath62 is nearly a square wave : it oscillates between the values at the different saddles .",
    "the relevant @xmath94 is typically odd and , therefore , @xmath95 approaches a well defined non - zero value . substituting it in eq .",
    "( 11 ) , we conclude that    @xmath96    * type ii*. either ( i ) the separatrix of the unperturbed system has a _ single saddle _ , or ( ii ) it has more than one saddle but",
    "the perturbation coefficient @xmath97 is _ identical _ for all saddles",
    ". then @xmath93 , as a periodic function of @xmath62 , significantly differs from its value at the saddle(s ) only during a small part of the period in @xmath62 : this part is @xmath98 .",
    "hence , @xmath99 . substituting this value in eq . ( 11 ) , we conclude that    @xmath100    thus , for systems of type i , the maximal width of the sm chaotic layer is proportional to @xmath17 times a logarithmically large factor @xmath101 while , for systems of type ii , it is proportional to @xmath17 times a numerical factor .",
    "as shown below , the variation of energy in between the instants relevant to the sm is @xmath18 , which thus it is much less than @xmath77 ( 12 ) for the systems of type i and it is of the same order of @xmath102 ( 13 ) for the systems of type ii .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the maximal width of the layer for the original hamiltonian system ( 1 ) , @xmath103 , is at least roughly approximated by that for the sm , @xmath104 , so that the above classification of systems is relevant to @xmath103 too .",
    "this is confirmed both by the numerical integration of equations of motion of the original hamiltonian system and by the more accurate theory presented in the next two sections .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we consider a concrete example of type i , while the generalization is straightforward .",
    "let us consider an archetypal example : the ac - driven pendulum ( sometimes called as a pendulum subject to a dipole time - periodic perturbation ) @xcite :    @xmath105    fig .",
    "2 presents the results of computer simulations ( i.e. of a numerical integration of the equations of motion ) for a few values of @xmath17 and several values of @xmath4 .",
    "it shows that : 1 ) the function @xmath106 indeed possesses sharp peaks ; their height greatly exceed the estimates by the heuristic @xcite , adiabatic and mathematical moderate - frequency @xcite theories ( see the inset ) ; 2 ) as predicted by the rough estimates in sec .",
    "iii , the 1st peak of @xmath107 shifts to smaller values of @xmath4 while its magnitude grows , as @xmath17 decreases .",
    "below , we develop the leading - order asymptotic theory and compare it with results of the simulations .    0.2 cm    0.9 cm 0.9 cm 0.2 cm    before moving on , we note that the sm ( approximated in the relevant case by the nonlinear resonance dynamics ) considers states of the system only at discrete instants .",
    "apart from the variation of energy within the sm dynamics , the variation of energy in the hamiltonian system occurs also in between the instants relevant to the sm . given that @xmath108 , this latter variation may be considered in adiabatic approximation and it is of the order of @xmath17 . as follows from the rough estimates above and from the accurate consideration below , the variation of energy within the sm dynamics for systems of type i is logarithmically larger i.e. larger by the factor @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the variation of energy in between the instants relevant to the sm may be neglected at the leading - order approximation for systems of type i ( the parameter of smallness of the asymptotic theory is @xmath110 ) : @xmath111 . for the sake of notational compactness",

    "factor @xmath72 ( for systems of type i ) or a _ numerical _ factor ( for systems of type ii ) .",
    "type i includes systems for which the separatrix of their unperturbed hamiltonian has more than one saddle while the perturbation is not identical on adjacent saddles ( an example is an ac - driven pendulum ) .",
    "all other systems belong to type ii .",
    "the latter type includes , in particular , a pendulum with an oscillating suspension point , for which our result differs from the result @xcite since the latter ( i ) is based on the conventional approximation of the nonlinear resonance ( not valid near the separatrix ) , and ( ii ) does not take into account the variation of energy during the velocity pulse ( i.e. in between the instants relevant to the separatrix map ) .",
    "our theory is verified by computer simulations .",
    "the shape of the peaks is strongly asymmetric . in the asymptotic limit of small amplitudes , the shape of the peaks for type",
    "universal_. for type ii , the shape is quite similar , differing only by a typically small contribution stemming from the variation of energy during the velocity pulse .",
    "finally , our work suggests a new method for the _ facilitation of global chaos onset _ due to the enhanced overlap of nonlinear resonances .",
    "the theoretical approach developed by us may be used to derive the optimal choice of parameters of the perturbation leading to the facilitation .",

    "formally , @xmath313 is not defined for @xmath38 but , if to shift @xmath26 from @xmath31 for an infinitesemal value , @xmath313 acquires the value equal to either @xmath314 or @xmath315 , dependently on the sign of the shift .",
    "given that @xmath316 is proportional to @xmath317 while the latter is random - like ( as it has been shown above ) , @xmath316 is not correlated with @xmath318 if @xmath319 .    for the sm relating to the ac - driven spatially periodic systems ,",
    "the time during which the sm undergoes a regular - like evolution above the separatrix diverges in the adiabatic limit @xmath14 @xcite , and the width of the part of the sm layer above the separatrix diverges too .",

    "the adiabatic estimate for @xmath106 is equal approximately to @xmath42 .",
    "the estimate following from the results of the mathematical work @xcite for @xmath10 is of the same order , so that it is conditionally represented in the inset in fig . 2 by the same line as for the adiabatic estimate ( dashed line ) .",
    "the disagrement between the theory and simulations for the magnitude of the 2nd peak is about three times larger than that for the 1st peak , so that the height of the 2nd peak is about 30@xmath323 smaller than that by the asymptotic theory .",
    "this occurs because , for energies relevant to the 2nd peak , the deviation from the separatrix is much higher than that for the 1st peak . due to the latter ,",
    "the fourier coefficient @xmath324 for the relevant @xmath26 is significantly smaller than that by the asymptotic formula ( 42 ) .",
    "besides , the velocity pulse contribution @xmath6 also significantly decreases while the separatrix split increases as @xmath4 becomes @xmath5 .",
    "the generalization of the theory for @xmath10 will be presented elsewhere .",
