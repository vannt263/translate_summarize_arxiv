    "it is well known that the standard theory does not predict several properties of the elementary particles ( such as mass and magnetic moment ) .",
    "furthermore , the different non - standard theories leave open the possibility that unknown ( exotic ) particles could still exist . in the recent past",
    ", several attempts have been made to understand how these particles could modify stellar evolution and , in turn , to use these modifications to constrain particle theory ( see raffelt 1996 for a recent review ) .",
    "the general procedure consists in the comparison of the observed properties of selected stars ( or of a cluster of stars ) with the prediction of theoretical stellar models obtained under different assumptions about the microphysics input .",
    "axions and wimps ( weak interactive massive particles ) are the most promising candidates for non baryonic dark matter .",
    "non accelerator tests for axions in the acceptable mass range are up to date available . in this situation ,",
    "stars in general and especially the best - known one , the sun , are being widely used to test particle physics .",
    "several experiments to detect solar and galactic axions have been performed ( sikivie 1983 ; lazarus et al .",
    "experiments with better sensitivity are currently underway ( van bibber et al . 1994 ; hagmann et al . 1996 and 1998 ( u.s . axion search ) ; matsuki et al .",
    "1996 ( kyoto experiment carrack ) ; moriyama 1998 , moriyama et al .",
    "1998 ; avignone iii et al . 1998 and",
    "gattone et al .",
    "( solax collaboration ) ) and there is a proposal to use the large hadron collider at cern ( zioutas et al .",
    "1998 ) to detect solar axions . for the moment",
    ", results have proved to be negative and therefore the existence of axions is an attractive but speculative hypothesis .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to show that asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars can also be used successfully as astroparticle physics laboratories .",
    "since they are very bright , their photometric and spectroscopic properties are well known ; for example , the agb luminosity function can be used to test the efficiency of any phenomenon which is related with the production , removal or transport of energy .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of observing directly the ongoing nucleosynthesis provides a rare opportunity to obtain information about the internal physical conditions .",
    "we recall that agb stars are formed by a dense and degenerate core made up of carbon and oxygen ( the co core ) surrounded by two interacting burning shells .",
    "the typical densities and temperatures of the co core and of the he and h - rich layers make these stars a suitable environment to check the reliability of the theory of nuclear and particle physics .    in order to illustrate the possible use of agb stars in the framework of astroparticle research , we will address the question of the existence of axions ( peccei and quinn 1977a and 1977b ) .",
    "there are two types of axion models , the hadronic model or ksvz ( kim 1979 , shifman et al .",
    "1980 ) and the dfsz ( zhitniskii 1980 , dine et al . 1981 ) model . in the first model ,",
    "the axion couples to hadrons and photons and in the second one also to charged leptons .",
    "the axion mass is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the peccei ",
    "quinn scale and the axion coupling to matter is proportional to @xmath3 . in principle",
    ", the model does not put any constraint on the value of @xmath2 , so the limits to the @xmath4 must be obtained from experimental arguments .    within the accepted mass range of dfsz axions , 10@xmath5 ev @xmath6 0.01 ev ( see raffelt , 1998 ) , axions produced in stellar interiors can freely escape from the star and remove energy , as do neutrinos .",
    "the possibility of using stellar interiors to constraint the axion mass was early recognised ( fukugita et al .",
    "the axion energy loss rates depend on the axion coupling strenght to electrons , photons and nucleons and the corresponding coupling constants depend on the axion mass and other model dependent constants . in this way",
    "axion mass limits are obtained .",
    "axions may couple to electrons ( kim 1987 ; cheng 1988 ; raffelt 1990 ; turner 1990 and kolb and turner 1990 ) ; the axionic fine structure constant is taken as @xmath7 , g is a dimensionless coupling constant that in the dfsz models is @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the axion mass in mev ( 10@xmath10 ev ) and @xmath11 is a model - dependent parameter that is usually set equal to 1 .    in models",
    "in which axions couple to electrons , the two most interesting types of axion interaction that can occur in stellar interiors are photoaxions ( @xmath12 ) , which is a particular branch of the compton scattering , and bremsstrahlung axions ( @xmath13 \\rightarrow [ z , a ] + e + a$])(see raffelt , 1990 ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the axion energy loss rates for these two kinds of interactions , for two chemical compositions .",
    "compton emission strongly increases with temperature ( approximately as t@xmath14 ) and is almost independent of the density .",
    "it is , however , inhibited by electron degeneracy .",
    "thus , compton emission is important in non - degenerate he - burning regions , when the temperature and , in turn , the photon density are high enough .",
    "bremsstrahlung requires greater densities and is not damped at large electron degeneracies .",
    "thus , it is dominant in degenerate he and co cores .",
    "as yet , few works have included axion interactions in stellar model computations ( see raffelt 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "isern , hernanz & garca  berro ( 1992 ) use the rate of change of the pulsational period of the white dwarfs during the cooling sequence to constrain the axion mass .",
    "such a rate depends on the cooling rate , namely : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the period of pulsation and t is the temperature of the white dwarf .",
    "if the white dwarf has not entered the crystallizing region of the cooling sequence , the discrepancy between the rate of change of the period due to photons alone , which can be obtained from models , and the observed one , which can be assumed to be caused by photons and axions , is @xmath17 in such a way , isern , hernanz & garca  berro ( 1992 and 1993 ) found , assuming @xmath11 = 1 , that @xmath18 8.7 , 15 and 12 mev by using the seismological data of the white dwarfs g117b15a , l192 and",
    "r548 , respectively .    other constraints can be obtained from the possible influence of axions on the evolution of low mass red giants .",
    "these stars develop a degenerate he core in which axions , if they exist , could produce a significant energy loss .",
    "dearborn , schramm and steigman ( 1986 ) found that the helium ignition would be suppressed for values of @xmath4 over a certain limit .",
    "unfortunatelly they overestimated the energy loss rate and later on , raffelt and dearborn ( 1987 ) found that , with the current limits , he ignition would never be supressed .",
    "these authors derived the most stringent limit at that time , for the axion - photon coupling , from the duration of the helium burning lifetime , @xmath19 0.7 ev ( ksvz model ) .",
    "raffelt and weiss ( 1995 ) subsequently reexamined the problem , analyzing the effects of the axion - electron coupling in observable quantities , such as the luminosity of the rgb ( red giant branch ) tip .",
    "they concluded that @xmath4 is lower than 9 mev , assuming @xmath11=1 ( dfsz model ) .",
    "another limit was obtained for the coupling strenght to photons by raffelt ( 1996 ) by comparing the number of hb ( horizontal branch ) with the number of rgb stars of galactic globular clusters , giving @xmath19 0.4 ev ( dfsz model ) .",
    "the most stringent limit come from the sn 1987a , constraints on the axion - nucleon coupling ( janka et al .",
    "1996 ; keil et al .",
    "1997 ) give , taken into account the overall uncertainties , @xmath19 0.01 ev for both , ksvz and dfsz models ( raffelt , 1998 ) .",
    "if axions exist , this would be of major consequence on the evolution of agb stars .",
    "in fact , in both the he shell and in the co core the physical conditions for an important emission of axions are met . inside the core",
    "there are no nuclear reactions and the gain of gravitational energy would be balanced by neutrino and axion energy losses .",
    "the he - burning shell reaches temperatures above @xmath20 k , much higher than those experienced during the central he - burning , and this could induce a huge production of photoaxions . therefore axions could alter the stellar lifetime and change the final mass of the co core .    in the following sections we will present various models of low and intermediate mass stars in the range of masses @xmath21 , with and without axion interactions . in particular we assume three different values of the leading parameter @xmath4 ( the axion mass ) , namely : 0 , 8.5 and 20 mev ( in the following case 0 , 1 and 2 respectively ) and set always @xmath11=1 .",
    "note that the larger value is roughly double the maximum value proposed by raffelt ( 1998 ) yet still marginally compatible with the properties of white dwarfs .",
    "we show that the inclusion of axions would imply a significant modification of the agb characteristics .",
    "we do not address the question of setting an astrophysical upper limit of the axion mass here , since this requires a profound comparison between observations of galactic and magellanic clouds agb stars and will be done in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have followed the evolution of a set of low and intermediate mass stars ( m= 0.8 , 1.5 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 and 9 m@xmath22 ) with solar metallicities , z=0.02 and y=0.28 .",
    "this mass interval includes stars that ignite he in degenerate conditions ( 0.8 and 1.5 m@xmath22 ) , stars that ignite he in non  degenerate conditions but form a degenerate co core ( 37 m@xmath22 ) and go through the entire agb phase , and stars that ignite c in partially degenerate conditions ( 8 and 9 m@xmath22 ) .",
    "the evolutionary sequences are started at the zams phase .",
    "for the two smaller masses ( 0.8 and 1.5 @xmath23 ) we stopped the sequence at the onset of the he flash .",
    "all the other sequences were terminated at the beginning of the thermal pulse phase or at c ignition . due to the large amount of computer time required to compute thermally pulsing models , only the 5 @xmath23 sequences ( with and without axions ) were followed throughout this phase .",
    "all the evolutionary sequences of stars were computed with the franec code ( frascati raphson newton evolutionary code ) , as described by chieffi and straniero ( 1989 ) .",
    "the most recent updates of the input physics were described by straniero , chieffi and limongi ( 1997 ) . when included ,",
    "the axion energy loss rate have been computed according to raffelt and weiss ( 1995 ) in the case of bremsstrahlung in degenerate conditions and compton and according to raffelt ( 1990 ) in the case of bremsstrahlung in non degenerate conditions .",
    "finally , for the 5 m@xmath22 star , we considered the case in which only the co core experiences axion energy losses , in order to distinguish the relative effects on the core and on the he shell and between the agb and hb phases .",
    "table 1 summarizes the results of the computed evolutionary sequences . from column 1 to 10",
    "we report : the total mass ( in solar units ) , the axion mass ( in mev ) , the surface he mass fraction after the first dredge - up , the tip luminosity of the first rgb ( red giant branch ) , the mass of the he core at the beginning of the he - burning ( in solar units ) , the central he burning life time , the he core mass ( in solar units ) at the end of central he burning , the e - agb ( early asymptotic giant branch ) life time , the surface he mass fraction after the second dredge - up and the co core mass ( in solar units ) at the end of the e - agb .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , it is interesting to note that the inclusion of axions modifies the initial / final mass relation ( see e.g. weidemann 1987 ) . during the thermal pulses , the mass of the co core increases as a result of the accretion of c freshly synthesized by the he flashes .",
    "however , the observed luminosity of agb stars ( weidemann 1987 ; wood et al . 1992 ) and the observed mass - loss rate at this phase , indicate that the occurrence of too many pulses is prevented by the removal of the envelope ( bedijn 1987 , baud and habing 1983 , van der veen , habing and geballe 1989 ) .",
    "the mass of the co white dwarf is essentially determined by the value reached at the end of the e - agb phase ( see vassiliadis and wood 1993 ; blcker 1995 ) . in figure 8",
    "we compare the co core mass ( a guess for the wd mass ) with the initial mass ( progenitor mass ) , for case 0 and case 1 .",
    "two more masses have been included , 4 and 6 m@xmath22 .",
    "the relative abundance of white dwarfs with masses @xmath24 and @xmath25 is given by @xmath26^{\\alpha}\\,\\frac{(dm / dm)_{m_0}}{(dm / dm)_{m_1}}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the star formation rate per unit volume in the solar neighbourhood is constant and that the initial mass function follows salpeter s law with @xmath27 and m(m ) is the relationship between the mass of the parent star and that of the white dwarf .",
    "note that if it were possible to separate the influence of the mass loss and the influence of axions during the agb phase , it would be possible to obtain very strong constraints to the properties of these particles .",
    "we have studied the effects of including axions ( dfsz model ) in the evolution of intermediate and low mass stars ( @xmath28 ) . among the various evolutionary phases affected by axion emission",
    ", the agb seems to be the most promising in terms of obtaining stringent constraints to the theory of particle physics .",
    "these effects are :    1.- a severe reduction in the size of the final co core , as compared with the values obtained from standard evolutions , implies some interesting modifications of observable quantities , such as the luminosity of agb stars and their residual mass . concerning the agb luminosity function in particular",
    ", the axion emission would imply a deficit of bright agb stars .",
    "the initial / final mass relation is also substantially modified and a deficit of massive white dwarfs is expected .",
    "2.- as a consequence of the axion cooling , the convective instabilities that characterize the double nuclear shell burning are more extended and the chemical composition of the surface could be significantly modified .",
    "a stronger @xmath29 dredge - up implies that the c star stage could be more easily ( and perhaps rapidly ) obtained .",
    "in addition the surface abundance of s - elements , which are the products of the neutron capture nucleosynthesis occurring during the interpulse ( through the @xmath30 neutron source ) and during the thermal pulse ( through the @xmath31 ) , are other important `` observable '' quantities to be used to constrain the properties of the axions as well as those of any other weak interactive particle proposed in non - standard theories of particle physics .",
    "it is a great pleasure to thank alessandro chieffi and marco limongi for helpful discussion .",
