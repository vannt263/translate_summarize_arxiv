    "it is possible to approximate a complicated continuous functions defined over finite domains by a polynomial and make the error less than a given accuracy . on the other side , polynomials can be characterized in many different bases such as the power product , bernstein basis , and tschebyscheff basis form , where every type of polynomial basis has its strength , advantages , and sometimes disadvantages .",
    "it is useful to switch bases and work with more than one basis for a given polynomial ; it is of vital importance in the efficiency of mathematical calculations , since many difficulties can be solved and many problems can be removed .",
    "the @xmath3 polynomials @xmath4 of degree @xmath5 @xmath6 , k=0,1,\\dots , n,$ ] defined as @xmath7 are called bernstein polynomials .",
    "there are a fair amount of literature on bernstein polynomials , they are known for their geometric and analytical properties , see @xcite for more details .",
    "analytic and geometric properties of bernstein polynomials make them important for the development of bzier curves and surfaces .",
    "the bernstein polynomials are the standard basis for the bzier representations of curves and surfaces in computer aided geometric design .",
    "however , the bernstein polynomials are not orthogonal and could not be used effectively in the least - squares approximation @xcite . since",
    "then the method of least squares approximation accompanied by orthogonal polynomials has been introduced and developed .      in the following definition ,",

    "thus , choosing @xmath28 to be orthogonal simplifies the least - squares approximation problem .",
    "the coefficients matrix of the normal equations will be diagonal , which gives a compact form for @xmath29 see @xcite for more details on the least squares approximations .",
