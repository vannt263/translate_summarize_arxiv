    "during a multiwavelength study of the cluster rx  j0848@xmath14456  ( @xmath0 ) and its slightly lower redshift ( 0.543 ) companion , which we shall call cl  j0848.8@xmath14455 , from the rosat deep cluster survey , @xcite discovered a gravitational arc at @xmath10  08@xmath1148@xmath1248@xmath13.76 ; @xmath1444@xmath1555@xmath1649@xmath17.6 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this shows an unusual narrow emission line spectrum identified with ultraviolet h , he , c , n and o lines at a redshift of @xmath18 . using arguments based on photoionization modelling",
    ", these authors suggested that the emission arises from low metallicity gas ionized , at a high ionization parameter ( @xmath19 = photon / matter density ) , by a source with a blackbody temperature of between 80,000 and 100,000k .",
    "the color temperature of the ionizing source could be constrained with some confidence due to the dominant strength of the ]   intercombination doublet over the ]  and  lines in the observed wavelength range .",
    "the two components of the arc and the extended , faint morphology suggest that the source lies along a fold caustic and so could be highly magnified . in this paper",
    ", we exploit the opportunity offered by this amplification to observe , in unprecedented detail , what appears to be a young , low metallicity star - forming region at an early epoch .",
    "in addition to the restframe uv spectra previously reported @xcite  we present new low and intermediate ( @xmath20 ) resolution optical spectra and h- and k - band spectra taken with the keck telescopes .",
    "together , these spectra allow the measurement of almost all the emission lines expected to be reasonably strong from ly@xmath4  to [ ] @xmath214959 , 5007 .",
    "the line strengths and profiles are used to study the physical , chemical and kinematic properties of the gas and the ionizing stars and make comparisons with lower redshift  regions and starforming galaxies .",
    "hst and groundbased imaging data are used both for photometric calibration purposes and as a basis for the gravitational lensing model that allows us to estimate the magnification .",
    "this source , while at a somewhat lower redshift , may be similar in many respects to the very faint , high redshift ly@xmath4  sources being found in the vicinity of clusters @xcite and in the field @xcite .",
    "two sets of mosaics covering the cluster were obtained with the hst wfpc  2 ( pi rosati ; proposal i d 7374 ) in filter f702w .",
    "the region containing the arc is within both sets of images and comprises a total exposure of 20 @xmath22 1200s @xcite .",
    "an additional 4800s of exposure in filter f814w ( pi elston ; proposal i d 8269 ) were also examined .",
    "all the images were retrieved from the st - ecf archive and standard ` on - the - fly ' pipeline processing performed using the latest calibration pipeline and reference files .",
    "the resultant calibrated single images were still dithered relative to each other , geometrically distorted and contained numerous cosmic rays .",
    "these frames were subsequently combined using the ` metadrizzle ' script ( fruchter 2002 , priv .",
    "comm . ) which implements the scheme described in @xcite to both detect and flag the cosmic rays and other defects and perform an optimum combination of the shifted frames using the ` drizzle ' method .",
    "the other sets of images , taken at different times and hence having different pointings and orientations , were aligned using their image header world - coordinate information .",
    "small final offsets to bring them into precise registration were determined from a study of objects in the overlap regions .    given the short color baseline , the data from these two filters give little color information .",
    "the f702w data are shown in figure  [ hst - image ] .",
    "together , these filters are dominated by nebular continuum emission ( see below ) but also include several strong emission lines , notably ]  @xmath211483 , 1486 ;  @xmath211548 , 1550 ; ]  @xmath211661 , 1666 and ]  @xmath211907 , 1909 .",

    "although the spectra were all taken in photometric conditions , the use of different slit widths and orientations means that photometric scaling factors must be applied in order to derive a consistent calibration .",

    "the arc in the southern cluster cl  j0848.8@xmath14455  is found at about @xmath43 from the brightest galaxy .",
    "the dominant cluster to the north , rx  j0848@xmath14456 , has a much larger velocity dispersion  @xmath44  km  s@xmath24   versus @xmath45  km  s@xmath24 @xcite and shows several arclets but no clear multiple image",
    ". given the low velocity dispersion of the southern cluster , it is reasonable to assume that the northern one contributes significantly to the lensing of the @xmath46 object .",
    "the lensed system is composed of two clumps ( a and b in figure  [ hst - image ] ) joined by a very faint , thin arc which can be followed for more than @xmath47 on either side .",
    "this forms an angle of about @xmath48 to the tangent to the main cluster galaxy .",
    "moreover , two extremely faint sub - clumps ( c and d ) , possibly associated with the lensed galaxy , are observed on the arc , symmetrically disposed with respect to images a and b. the overall system shows a clear mirror symmetry , suggesting that the source lies close to a fold caustic .",
    "the two images a and b do not have an obvious counter - image , which argues that they are highly magnified .",
    "indeed , the third unobserved image , in our situation , should be of ` type  i ' @xcite , and thus have a magnification ( slightly ) larger than unity .    in the restframe ,",
    "our spectra extend from 1000  to 5400   with gaps from 21003500  and from 41004500 .",
    "there is a weak but clearly detected continuum in the ultraviolet , rising from @xmath49@xmath35jy  around ly@xmath4  to @xmath50@xmath35jy  near ] .",
    "this continuum is not , however , detected in the optical band from our nir spectra : 3@xmath51  continuum limits from nirspec are 5@xmath35jy  in h and 12@xmath35jy  in the k band .",
    "the emission spectrum is unusual in terms of the relative line intensities . in particular , the intercombination lines of ] , ]  and ]  are very strong while forbidden [ ]  is undetected and much weaker than [ ] .",
    "the absence of  and the weakness of ]  suggests that the source of ionization is blackbody - like rather than a power - law extending to high energies .",
    "@xmath521640 is detected but we do not see  @xmath524686 in our nir data .",
    "the possibility that such an emission spectrum could arise by photoionization from a ` filtered ' agn continuum in the outer parts of an obscured quasar host galaxy is discussed by @xcite .",
    "they consider mimicing a hot black - body by partially absorbing a power - law spectrum with high ionization parameter gas close to an agn .",
    "such an explanation is not pursued further in this paper .    a spectrum of this nature , and we have been able to find nothing that closely resembles it in the available uv spectral archives or the literature , suggests that we are dealing with a compact ( high ionization parameter @xmath19 ) low density gaseous nebula , ionized by a hot ( @xmath53k ) thermal source .",
    "the lines are narrow ( fwhm@xmath54100  km  s@xmath24 ) although ly@xmath4  is broader and self - absorbed .",
    "has a complex profile that also suggests absorption of the emission doublet .",
    "our optical spectra show that the ] ,  and  lines have broader , low intensity wings while the ]  exhibits a narrow base .",
    "the h@xmath40  and [ ]  are unresolved in our spectra but they show no signs of a broad base .",
    "the restframe uv continuum rises longward of ly@xmath4  and there is no evidence for an underlying blue stellar population unless it suffers significant reddening . since the emission line equivalent widths are so large , we have calculated the expected nebular continuum , predominantly the hydrogen 2-photon emission in this spectral range , from the observed strength of h@xmath40 .",
    "the coefficients are from @xcite , assuming @xmath55k , a temperature justified by the photoionization modelling presented in section  [ photoionization ] .",
    "the calculated continuum is plotted in figure  [ photometry ] and it is a reasonable fit to both the shape and level of the observed sed in the restframe uv , suggesting that the nebula is essentially reddening - free .    to gain some quantitative insight into the limits that can be placed on the nature of any underlying stellar population ,",
    "we have plotted two fiducial synthetic sed on figure  [ photometry ] .",
    "these are from ` starburst 99 ' @xcite and represent instantaneous burst models of @xmath56  with a salpeter imf with @xmath57 , an upper and lower mass cut - off of @xmath58  and @xmath59  respectively and a metallicity of @xmath60 .",
    "they include both the stellar and nebular continuua and their ages are one and five million years .",
    "the model luminosities have been scaled to observed fluxes from the redshift of the arc , using the cosmological model defined in section [ ionizing ] , and we have multiplied by a lens magnification factor of ten .",
    "emission lines have been measured from the different spectra and averaged , using the procedure described above , to represent the sum of fluxes from components a and b. the results are presented in table  [ line - fluxes ] together with the velocity dispersions of the narrowest components fitted to the esi data for the stronger lines .",
    "the ]  doublet @xmath21 1883 , 1892 seen in the esi spectrum merits some comment .",
    "it is underpredicted by all of our photoionization models using scaled solar abundances ( see below ) but the 1883  line is seen in two esi orders and , while close to the formal 3@xmath51  detection limit , the 1892  feature is at precisely the correct wavelength to be the second component of the doublet ( see figure  [ silicon3 ] ) .",
    "we , therefore ascribe a high confidence level to the detection .    both ly@xmath4  and  are affected by absorption which we have modelled using pure gaussian line emission and absorption coefficients . when fitting the esi data , the model components are broadened in quadrature using an instrumental width derived from sky and arc lines and taking the form @xmath61()@xmath62  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "the fit to ly@xmath4  is shown in figure  [ lya - fit ] and the parameters for the two emission and two absorption components are given in table  [ abs - fit ] .",
    "these four components are the minimum number required for a satisfactory fit and show the presence of an outflowing wind with a low velocity component at @xmath2615  km  s@xmath24  having an  column density of @xmath63  @xmath64 .",
    "the  doublet is similarly modelled with each component having two emission and two absorption components ( figure  [ civ - fit ] ) with the doublet separation and oscillator strength ratio constrained to their theoretical values .",
    "these fit parameters also appear in table  [ abs - fit ] together with the h@xmath65  and c@xmath66  column densities derived from @xmath67  and @xmath51 .",
    "the  fit is less well constrained due to the lower s / n of the data for this weaker line .",
    "the value of @xmath68 is , however , required to be @xmath69  in order to match the steepness of the red edges of the absorption troughs .",
    "note that for both ly@xmath4  and for , the two emission components have no relative velocity offset .",
    "the velocity offsets of the absorption components in the two species are not identical .",
    "such an effect could result from an ionization gradient in the flow .",

    "in section  [ lensing ] , the lens modelling is discussed with the principal aim of computing the magnification that will allow the estimation of the true observed brightness of the source . using a grid of photoionization models in conjunction with the observed emission line ratios , we discuss in section  [ photoionization ]  the nature of the source : physical conditions , nebular element abundances and the characteristics of the ionizing source .",
    "the absorption components seen in ly@xmath4  and in  allow us to deduce some properties of the wind for comparison with low - redshift  galaxies .",
    "finally , in section  [ ionizing ]  we compare the observed line luminosity , using a current ` standard ' cosmology , with the value prediced from the @xmath72  calibration of local  regions / galaxies from @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of the lensing analysis in this study is to constrain the magnification of the lens .",
    "the modeling has been carried out using two guiding principles .",
    "firstly , we note that the system is intrinsically complex because of the cluster environment .",
    "hence , an accurate description of the mass distribution should include several components , corresponding to the main galaxies that are contributing to the lensing signal .",
    "secondly , the number of constraints available from the observed images is rather small . in particular , using the observed positions , ellipticities and fluxes of the two main images ( a & b ) we have 5  free parameters for the lensing model .",
    "these two competing facts put strong constraints on the families of models we can use . with only two images , we can not use more than 5 parameters ; on the other hand , since the system is complex , we need to take into account the effects of the several masses that might contribute to the lensing .",
    "a standard method , which we adopt here , is to model the _ collective _ effect of nearby galaxies as an external shear ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more formally , it can be shown that , within a given region of sky , the gravitational lensing effect of external masses can be described using a multipole expansion ( see schneider & bartelmann 1997 ) . in this framework ,",
    "the external shear represents a quadrupole term , this being the first observable multipole .",
    "we also stress that in many strong lensing studies the external shear is required for a good fit seems to be larger than one would expect by considering the influence of the nearby masses ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a simple quantitative analysis can be used to better understand the lens . assuming that the system is symmetric and that no external field is acting upon it , we can obtain a first estimate of the mass inside the einstein radius of the system .",
    "the definition of the einstein radius is in our case rather arbitrary since , as mentioned above , the apparent centre of the arc is far away from the centre of the brightest galaxy in cl  j0848.8@xmath14455  ( the centre of figure  [ lens - model ] ) . in any case , assuming an einstein radius of about @xmath43 ( i.e. , the observed angular distance between the arc and the brightest cluster galaxy ) , we obtain a projected velocity dispersion for the lens of about 550  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "this is likely to be too high for a single galaxy and too small when compared with the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "hence , this suggests that the lens system can be explained only if we take into account both the strong gravitational field of the central galaxy and the external tidal field of the cluster .",
    "notice that the detailed lens modeling presented below is independent of the simple analysis discussed here .",
    "@xcite have discussed in detail the impact of substructures on the lens models .",
    "they note how , in several cases , simple lensing models are able to account for the observed configurations but fail to reproduce the observed fluxes ratios between the various images .",
    "the conclusion is that small - scale substructure could play a significant role .",
    "the effect of substructures is particularly important in highly - magnified images where even a small change in the local density ( for example , due to a compact object such as a globular cluster ) can have large effects on the observed fluxes ; more recent studies reach the same conclusion ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have modeled the lens as a single elliptical profile , centred on the dominant cluster galaxy ( figure  [ lens - model ] ) .",
    "contributions from other galaxies have been represented by an external shear .",
    "the mass profile of the lens was taken to be a pseudo - isothermal profile ( see , e.g. , @xcite with velocity dispersion @xmath73 , core radius @xmath74 , and truncation radius @xmath75 .",
    "more specifically , the surface mass density of the lens ( i.e. , the mass density projected along the line of sight ) is taken to be    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the elliptical coordinate for an ellipse of axis @xmath78 :    @xmath79    note that we used a model with an elliptical mass distribution rather than an unphysical elliptical potential ( see @xcite for a discussion on this point ) .",
    "this mass distribution is characterized by a total mass ( in the limit of small ellipticities , @xmath80 )    @xmath81    the lens parameters were obtained by fitting the predicted image positions , fluxes and ellipticities to the observed data .",
    "the fitting procedure was carried out first on the source plane @xcite . given a lens model , the observed positions of each image were projected onto the source plane and compared to each other . in our analysis , we extended this technique to include the observed fluxes and ellipticities .",
    "the final fit was then carried out by inverting the lens equation and fitting directly the observed quantities on the lens plane .",
    "the lens inversion was performed using a technique similar to the one described by keeton ( 2001 ) .",
    "the final minimization was done using a simulated annealing algorithm ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this method , which is based on an analogy with a thermodynamic process ( the formation of crystals as a liquid _ slowly _ freeze ) , has proved to be very effective in dealing with minimization of functions in high - dimension spaces , when the presence of local minima can create severe problems to standards algorithms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we briefly present the final results of the lensing analysis .",
    ".the relevant parameters for the four lens models described in the text . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for each lens model the fitting algorithm was run several times in order to check the reliability of the results obtained .",
    "indeed , the minimization procedure , based on a simulated annealing method , has an external parameter , the ` temperature ' of the system , that needs to be carefully tuned ( see @xcite for a brief discussion on the simulated annealing algorithm ) .",
    "for example , a low temperature can prevent the algorithm from finding the global minimum of the @xmath82 function .    in order to better understand the degeneracies of the system",
    ", we tried several models . in almost all cases",
    ", we were able to reproduce the observed positions , fluxes and ellipticities of the images with good accuracy ( see table  [ lens - table ] ) .",
    "clearly , we do not claim that all the models are an accurate description of the system .",
    "rather , we provide a number of models that give good fits to the data in order to show the possible range of magnifications for the system .",
    "all models require a very large external shear .",
    "interestingly , the external shear of many models ( see in particular models 1 , 2 , and 4 in table  [ lens - table ] ) is approximately aligned with the direction of the northern cluster . assuming a velocity dispersion of @xmath83  km  s@xmath24@xcite",
    ", we find that about one half of the external shear required by our models can be simply explained by this cluster ; the remaining external shear is probably due to other galaxies in cl  j0848.8@xmath14455 .",
    "the simplest model tried on the system is a singular isothermal elliptical lens ( sie ) centred on the main cluster galaxy in cl  j0848.8@xmath14455   with an additional external shear ( model 1 in table  [ lens - table ] ) this model is characterized by five free parameters : the lens velocity dispersion @xmath73 , ellipticity @xmath84 , position angle @xmath85  and the two components of the external shear , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "although the model is very simple , the final fit is very good ; the only significant residuals come from the fit to the flux ( which contributes to the total @xmath82  of @xmath88 ) .",
    "the best model has a round lens and a rather large external shear .",
    "this produces a faint third image ( about 10 times fainter than image a ) which would be difficult to detect in our data .",
    "figure  [ lens - model ] shows the best fit configuration .    in order to reduce the external shear",
    ", we tried to add a significant ` penalty ' on the @xmath82 for large external shears ( model  2 ) .",
    "this , however , did not reduce significantly the shear and produced larger errors on the fluxes . interestingly , because of the well known degeneracy between the external shear and the lens ellipticity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the final fit obtained was qualitatively different from model  1 .",
    "the inclusion of 4 more images ( see figure  [ hst - image ] ) in the fitting algorithm led to model  3 .",
    "these extra images include the mirror - symmetric components c and d as well as fainter substructure within a and b. the best solution has a low @xmath82 , a very faint third image but a large lens ellipticity and external shear .    in model  4 , we tried to use a candidate third image labelled t in figure  [ hst - image ] .",
    "this object , from groundbased observations @xcite , is found to have a color consistent with our source and is in a good position to be a candidate third image . in all models obtained in this configuration ,",
    "further images are either not present or extremely faint .",
    "the best fit model shows significant scatter on the fluxes and on the ellipticities and thus has a large @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we also tried to relax the position of the lensing galaxy around the observed position ; this , however , never significantly improved the fit .    in summary ,",
    "we find a relatively wide range of models that successfully describe the system .",
    "the total magnification for the images a@xmath1b in our models span the range @xmath89@xmath90 . hence , although the present study is not able to completely constrain the system , there are indications that the source could be strongly magnified by the lens .",
    "the class of acceptable models would be narrowed should a third image be found . for the following discussion",
    ", we should be aware that , by being so close to a caustic , some part of the source may be more highly magnified than the average .",
    "this could affect the interpretation of line ratios and widths in terms of spatially - averaged models .",
    "photoionization modelling is carried out using the c  code @xcite . for the exploration of the spectrum discussed in this paper",
    ", we have assumed that the gas is ionized by a pure black body . in effect , the stellar cluster is replaced by a single ionizing star with a temperature @xmath91 @xcite , based on the notion that the ionizing spectrum is not strongly dependent on the slope of the imf .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in stellar clusters since the number of ionizing photons increases so rapidly with the temperature of the hottest stars @xcite .",
    "the acceptability of the black body approximation as a representation of the real sed of a massive star is , of course , strongly dependent on the stellar metallicity although for metal - free stars @xcite they are very similar .",
    "deducing the true nature of the ionizing stellar cluster from the nebular emission alone is difficult .",
    "there are , however , several important clues that indicate the presence of massive , luminous and probably very low metallicity stars .",
    "these are :    * the color temperature of the ionizing source is much higher than seen in  regions in the local universe . the ionizing flux in typical galactic compact  regions are typically characterized by stellar model effective temperatures @xmath92 40,000k @xcite which correspond to somewhat lower color temperatures . * the ionization parameter , @xmath19 is also higher than seen in local  regions . *",
    "the nebula emits  @xmath521640 . *",
    "no stellar continuum is observed between ly@xmath4  and the visible spectrum . *",
    "the cluster has a very high ionizing photon luminosity yet the nebular lines are narrow , indicating a low gravitating mass ( see section  [ ionizing ] ) .",
    "while these observations do not uniquely diagnose the presence of population  iii stars , they are all qualitatively consistent with the predictions of the models of such stars and their surrounding nebul . in particular",
    ", the question of the actual time - averaged ionizing properties of system containing massive population iii stars , including the effects of evolution away from the zams and assumptions regarding the imf are addressed by @xcite .",
    "the ]   emission line ratio indicates that the ionized gas density is at or below the low density limit for this doublet ( @xmath93  @xmath94 , @xcite ) . in our models ,",
    "we assume @xmath95  @xmath94 , ensuring that there are no significant collisional de - excitation effects .",
    "an increase in density would result merely in a decrease in the ionization parameter @xmath19 .",
    "our models are isobaric which means that we set the density at the illuminated face of the cloud and it increases with depth to keep the pressure constant .",
    "we have assumed a plane - parallel geometry , modelling the emission from a single ` cloud ' ionized by a central cluster of stars .",
    "the output spectrum can be considered as the integrated emission from many clouds distributed spherically around the ionizing source . in dust - free models ,",
    "different geometries will be represented by different effective values of the ionization parameter @xmath19 . in the presence of dust , however , the geometry will determine the photon escape probabilities and so will have a much stronger effect on line ratios , especially those involving ly@xmath4  and .",
    "since models of low redshift  regions generally employ a spherical geometry , it should be noted that our values of @xmath19 are not directly comparable .",
    "our photoionization models explore a parameter space consisting of the ionizing source black body temperature @xmath96 , the ionization parameter @xmath19 and the gas metallicity @xmath97 .",
    "the metallicity has been scaled in proportion to the relative solar abundances @xcite and assumes no depletion onto dust .",
    "such a representation of the element abundance distribution is probably quite inappropriate for a source at this epoch but we do not explore this part of the parameter space in this paper . our objective is to find a ` fiducial ' model that represents the general nature of the emission line spectrum and to discuss how departures from it might be addressed .",
    "the color temperature of the photoionizing source is relatively well - determined by the nitrogen spectrum .",
    "the dominance of ]  over both  and ]  restricts @xmath96 to @xmath98  k. such an ionizing sed would dominate the continuum spectrum shortward of ly@xmath4  but , in our observed spectral range , would be much weaker than the nebular continuum .",
    "this is consistent with the result presented in figure  [ photometry ]  see also : @xcite .",
    "there are two line ratios that are sensitive to metallicity but essentially independent of stellar temperature and only weakly dependent on @xmath19 : /  and [ ] /h@xmath40 .",
    "the observed ratios both exclude very low metallicities ( @xmath99 ) which would result in very strong h and he lines relative to  and [ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath100 is excluded by the observed value of [ ] /h@xmath40   in this regime where oxygen is not the dominant coolant and the ratio depends directly on metallicity .",
    "consequently , we assume a gas - phase metallicity of @xmath101  with an uncertainty of about a factor of two . the line spectrum in general is best reproduced with a high ionization parameter , @xmath102 .",
    "such a high value of @xmath19 distinguishes the spectrum from that of a planetary nebula which can have a similar stellar color temperature .",
    "the line spectrum produced by this fiducial model ( @xmath103k , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) is presented in table  [ line - fluxes ] .",
    "photoionization models with these parameters always predict weak ]  lines : our fiducial model implies a si / c ratio approximately forty times larger than the solar ratio .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by decreasing the ionization parameter but at the cost of essentially eliminating the ] , ] and  lines .",
    "similarly , decreasing @xmath96  will strengthen ]  but weaken the high ionization lines .",
    "the minimum si / c ratio we can obtain by decreasing @xmath96  to 60,000k is around five in solar units .",
    "this quantitative conclusion should be treated with some caution due to the simplicity of our photoionization model , e.g. , the use of a black body sed in place of a real stellar continuum .",
    "the rate of ionizing photon production needed to power the arc can be estimated from the de - magnified h@xmath40  flux . using a cosmology with @xmath106  km s@xmath107 mpc@xmath107 ; @xmath108  and @xmath109  with the source redshift of @xmath110",
    ", we compute a luminosity distance of @xmath111 mpc .",
    "the ( hydrogen ) ionizing photon luminosity @xmath112  is then given by :    @xmath113    where @xmath35  is the lens magnification and the @xmath114  and @xmath115  are respectively the total and effective h@xmath40  case b hydrogen recombination coefficients for @xmath55k @xcite .",
    "using @xmath116  and @xmath117  from table  [ line - fluxes ] , we get @xmath118  ph s@xmath24 , assuming a nebular covering factor of unity .",
    "this number can be used to constrain the nature of the ionizing stellar population . the number of massive stars needed to provide this photon flux depends in detail on the cluster imf and on the stellar metallicity .",
    "the stellar color temperature we deduce from the emission line spectrum is very high and argues for a low stellar metallicity , possibly much lower than the nebular metallicity which may be affected by stellar winds and earlier supernova explosions .",
    "using the population  iii stellar models given by @xcite , the appropriate range for @xmath119 lies between about 49 and 50 , indicating that we are dealing with up to 10@xmath120  massive stars .",
    "the observed sed can also place constraints on the stellar population subject to uncertainties in the extinction to the stellar cluster .",
    "figure  [ photometry ]  includes starburst  99 models ( see section  [ continuum ] ) that illustrate the level and shape of the sed expected for a very young cluster of @xmath56  with a normal salpeter imf lensed by the cluster of galaxies .",
    "an unreddened cluster of this mass would be marginally detected in our optical data but would only produce a @xmath121 ph s@xmath24 , a factor of twenty below the estimated requirement .    the modest value of the velocity dispersion measured for the ]  and the ]  lines of @xmath122  km  s@xmath24  places an effective limit on the gravitating mass within the line emitting region .",
    "if we use the calibration of the @xmath123  relation for  galaxies by @xcite    @xmath124    we predict the intrinsic h@xmath40  luminosity to be @xmath125  for the nebular oxygen abundance of @xmath126  that is implied by our photoionization models .",
    "this is about 150 times smaller than the observed value of 43.63 and is inconsistent with our estimate of the lensing magnification of only @xmath116 .",
    "there are many uncertainties in this argument , not least the extreme extrapolation of the @xmath123  relation to low metallicity",
    ". a crucial issue may be the nature of the metallicty term in this relation whose value was determined empirically by @xcite for local  regions and galaxies .",
    "the physics of the metallicity dependence is to do with the luminosities of the ionizing stars ( @xmath112 ) rather than the chemical composition of the surrounding nebula .",
    "it is the metallicity of the stars that determines their imf and mass - to - light ratio and , at early epochs as we have noted above , this may be considerably lower than the wind and supernova - polluted surroundings .",
    "whatever the solution of this discrepancy turns out to be , there is a strong indication that the lynx arc has a very low mass - to - light ratio implying an imf dominated by massive stars .",
    "emission line velocity widths and characteristic sizes for faint sources with @xmath127 0.19 to 0.35 were measured by @xcite who found gaussian velocity dispersions of @xmath128 30 to 50 km  s@xmath24  and inferred masses of @xmath129 . for a higher redshift sample of luminous , compact , blue galaxies with @xmath127 0.4 to 1.2",
    ", @xcite used multi - broad - band photometry to deduce stellar masses with a median value of @xmath130 , a factor of about two lower than previous virial estimates .",
    "they concluded that @xmath131  compact blue galaxies at intermediate redshifts are about an order of magnitude less massive than typical @xmath131  galaxies today .",
    "another lensed galaxy seen at high redshift and studied in detail is ms  1512-cb58 with @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "this is an @xmath131  lyman - break galaxy with a clearly measured stellar sed characterized by a continuous star formation model with a salpeter imf , an age of about 20 myr and a virial mass of @xmath133 .",
    "this has a metallicity of about 1/4 @xmath134 , a few times higher than typical damped ly@xmath4  systems at the same redshift . in comparison ,",
    "the lynx arc is much younger , has a considerably lower metallicity and is less massive .",
    "the intrinsic , unlensed h@xmath40  luminosity of ms  1512-cb58 is some five times lower than that of the lynx arc and it does not exhibit the strong ultraviolet emission spectrum which results from the latter s very hot ionizing stars .",
    "the lynx arc was discovered during the spectroscopic follow - up of the rosat deep cluster survey .",
    "the fortuitous location of an  galaxy near a fold caustic in the source plane of a complex cluster environment at a redshift of a half has given us the opportunity to study the properties of an intrinsically luminous starforming region is some detail at a redshift of 3.357 .    from observations of the emission line spectrum from ly@xmath4  to [ ]",
    "we show that the  region is characterized by very hot ionizing stars with a temperature of @xmath135k and a high ionization parameter of @xmath7 .",
    "while the nebular metallicity is not dramatically low , with @xmath136 , there is indirect evidence that the ionizing stellar cluster is considerably more metal - poor .",
    "the low velocity dispersion of the nebula and the high luminosity imply a very low mass - to - light ratio for the part of the  galaxy that is strongly magnified .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the absence of any detectable stellar continuum in the spectrum longward of ly@xmath4 : the observed flux in the restframe uv being satisfactorily explained as pure nebular continuum with no dust reddening .",
    "an unreddened young stellar cluster of @xmath56  with a normal imf would be detected in our data .",
    "the outflowing wind seen as absorption components in both ly@xmath4  and   is highly ionized , having similar column densities of @xmath137  @xmath64  in both h@xmath65 and in c@xmath66 .",
    "this is in contrast to local  galaxies which typically have h@xmath65  column densities closer to @xmath138  @xmath64  @xcite .    from our photoionization modelling of the nebula , using scaled solar abundances , the most outstanding discrepancy amongst the observed and predicted emission line intensities is the ]  doublet at @xmath211883 , 1892 .",
    "the substantial overabundance of silicon suggested by this observation may be a nucleosynthetic signature of past pair instability supernov  in a population  iii cluster @xcite .",
    "these supernov  result in the total disruption of stars in the mass range @xmath139 and produce an excess of elements with odd nuclear charge relative to the even nuclei .",
    "it appears that we are witnessing a very early phase of star formation in a dwarf galaxy which initially had sufficiently low metallicity to allow the formation of many high mass stars producing an effective ionizing color temperature much higher than found in such objects in the local universe .",
    "the magnification - corrected ionizing luminosity of @xmath118  ph s@xmath24  implies the presence of some 10@xmath120  hot o stars , while the low gas velocity dispersion and the absence of any detected stellar continuum longward of ly@xmath4  demands a low mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the nebula has a high ionization parameter and there is an outflowing wind , ranging in velocity from @xmath3  to @xmath140  km  s@xmath24 , which is much more highly ionized than winds in local  galaxies .",
    "we are fortunate to have found such an object lensed by an intervening cluster of galaxies .",
    "its intrinsic luminosity is , however , sufficiently high that astrophysically meaningful observations could be obtained of similar objects that are unmagnified .",
    "the lynx arc represents a galaxy that is considerably less massive than a typical lyman break galaxy at a similar redshift @xcite  but one that is in a very short - lived luminous phase lasting as little as a few million years and powered by a top - heavy imf containing many stars with temperatures approaching @xmath141 k.    acknowledgments : this paper resulted from the serendipitous discovery of the lynx arc in the rosat deep cluster survey .",
