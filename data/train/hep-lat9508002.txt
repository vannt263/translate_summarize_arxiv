    "in many - particle systems it is often convenient , or even necessary , to replace the fundamental two - particle interaction by an effective interaction , which can be very different from the original .",
    "for example , in metals the repulsive coulomb interaction between the valence electrons  because of the presence of the underlying ionic lattice  is replaced by an effective interaction that is attractive . also in nuclei , the free two - nucleon potential gets strongly modified by the presence of the other nucleons . in both of these examples , after this removal of the explicit photon and meson degrees of freedom , the resultant effective interaction is still mainly in the form of a * two*-body interaction  with only a minor three - body term arising in the nuclear case .",
    "however , for a system of quarks interacting via gluon - exchange  even though this basic interaction is that of qcd  little is known in multiquark systems about the corresponding effective interquark interaction after the explicit gluon degrees of freedom have been removed .",
    "this is an important question , if realistic calculations are to be made for interacting quark clusters e.g.  as in meson - meson , meson - nucleon or , eventually , nucleus - nucleus scattering . at present , the only way to carry out these fundamental calculations is by using monte carlo lattice techniques .",
    "unfortunately , mainly due to the limitations of present day computers , these calculations are restricted to clusters of , at most , two or three quarks ",
    "see for example ref .",
    "therefore , a bridge is needed between lattice calculations involving few quarks and conventional many - body techniques that can accomodate larger numbers of quarks .    in an attempt to throw some light on the relationship between qcd and the effective interquark interaction , a series of model calculations",
    "have recently been made @xcite@xcite . in these",
    ", the energies of four quarks in various configurations ( e.g.on the corners of a rectangle or tetrahedron ) have been calculated in quenched static su(2 ) on a @xmath1 lattice .",
    "the reason for studying four quarks is because of the possibility for partitioning these into different colour - singlet groups each containing two quarks  a situation not possible with 2 and 3 quark systems .",
    "this can then be considered as a step towards the * scattering * of quark clusters  in this case meson - meson scattering .",
    "hopefully , many of the features of an effective interquark interaction in su(2 ) will be preserved in the more realistic case of su(3 )  in the same way as , for example , the ratios of glue - ball masses / string energy are numerically very similar in su(2 ) and su(3 ) @xcite@xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , the main feature in the results is that the strongest interaction between two separate two - quark clusters occurs when two of the three possible partitions of the clusters are * degenerate * , or almost degenerate , in energy .",
    "this was first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the four - quark binding energy @xmath2 dropped by an order of magnitude , when the four - quark geometry changed from that of a square [ @xmath3 to a neighbouring rectangle [ @xmath4  where @xmath5 is the length of a side of the square in lattice units @xmath6 .",
    "for example , @xmath7  mev compared with @xmath8 .",
    "subsequent works verified this observation with other geometries , where the two partitions were not exactly degenerate  but more so than for the above rectangles .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite this was achieved by tilting the rectangles out of the planes defining the underlying lattice , and also with other non - planar geometries .",
    "these latter cases showed that it was indeed the * energy * degeneracy dictating the size of the interaction and not a geometrical degeneracy .",
    "in other words , with clusters ( 13)(24 ) and interquark potentials @xmath9 , it is the degeneracy @xmath10 that matters and not @xmath11 . for large interquark distances @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the string energy and @xmath14 an additive constant . in that case , the energy- and geometrical- degeneracy are the same .",
    "however , this is only true for @xmath15  fm and in the interesting region dominated by explicit quark interactions it is the energy degeneracy criterion that must be used .",
    "this is contrary to the assumption made with the so - called flip - flop model of ref .",
    "@xcite that takes the geometrical degeneracy criterion for all interquark distances .",
    "the reason for studying many different 4-quark configurations ( i.e.rectangles , linear , non - planar , etc . ) is to give a representative selection of geometrical possibilities that arise in practice when , for example , two mesons scatter . any quark model for such a scattering , when reduced to the same conditions as the lattice calculation [ i.e.  static , quenched , su(2 ) ] should give for the above selection of configurations the * same * values for the 4-quark energies @xmath2 . as said earlier , the representative selection of 4-quark configurations concentrated on those cases where two of the three possible partitions were degenerate in energy .",
    "however , a potentially interesting case is that of the tetrahedron , where all three partitions are now degenerate .",
    "this is the main subject of this paper and is discussed in section 2 . for completeness , the series of configurations shown in figure 1 are treated with @xmath16 and @xmath17  the tetrahedron being @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 case is then closely related to the earlier work on squares with @xmath20 and serves as a check on those calculations , since they were done with a set of basis states restricted to two in number and not three as in the present work .",
    "since the completion of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , it has been suggested @xcite that perhaps more care is needed in extracting energies and their statistical errors from a series of monte carlo results .",
    "therefore , in section 3 , the data is analysed taking into account data correlations between different euclidean times .",
    "0.5 cm    since most of the details of the lattice monte carlo calculation have been given in the earlier papers @xcite@xcite , this section will only very briefly outline those details concentrating mainly on aspects specific to the geometry shown in fig.[f : paths ] .    throughout this study the four quarks are treated in the static quenched approximation on a @xmath1 lattice in su(2 ) with @xmath0  corresponding to a lattice spacing of @xmath21  fm .",
    "both the four - quark energies @xmath22 and the corresponding two - quark energies @xmath23 are extracted on this lattice . however , the main quantities of interest are the ground state binding energy @xmath24 and the excited state energies @xmath25 defined by the differences @xmath26    as described in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , the @xmath27 potentials are calculated from a 3 * 3 variational basis , where  after fixing the gauge so that all temporal links are set to unity  the three states are constructed from basic lattice links that have been `` fuzzed '' to different levels  12 , 16 and 20 in the spatial directions .",
    "this fuzzing essentially models a glue flux - tube between the two quarks in question .",
    "for the cases where these two quarks are not along a given spatial axis [ e.g.  @xmath28 , the appropriate path of links is then constructed as the average of the two most simple paths connecting @xmath29 and @xmath30  each consisting of one straight section along the @xmath29 and @xmath30 axes . for @xmath31 , using only the maximum fuzzing level of 20 , the basis states are constructed from the different partitions of four quarks into a product of two two - quark colour - singlet clusters . in some cases it seems natural to restrict the variational basis to just two partitions e.g.  with rectangles the two involving the sides of the rectangle and not the one constructed from the two diagonal paths . however , in other cases  especially for the tetrahedron of interest here  it is seems to be necessary to keep all three partitions .",
    "having constructed the above paths ( e.g.@xmath32 and @xmath33 ) from fuzzy links , wilson loops @xmath34  the quantities from which the final energies are extracted  are then simply given , with the present gauge , as the overlap of paths separated by euclidean time @xmath35 i.e.@xmath36 .",
    "the energies @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ ei ] ) are expected to be exact in the sense that they are not the result of a truncated weak or strong coupling expansion .",
    "however , they do contain uncertainties such as :    \\a ) statistical errors . to a large extent",
    "these can be estimated with reasonable accuracy ",
    "the subject of section 3 .",
    "\\b ) systematic errors . by their very nature",
    "they are much harder to estimate . throughout",
    ", the aim is to attempt at minimizing their effect . in general ,",
    "the most obvious source of such errors is the use of a lattice that is too small ( i.e.  too few points ) or has a grid that is too coarse ( i.e.  @xmath38 too small ) for the results to represent those expected in the continuum limit of the lattice .",
    "this was checked in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a @xmath39 lattice at @xmath40 , which corresponds to a lattice spacing @xmath41  fm . in the present type of calculation ,",
    "since  as seen from eq .",
    "( [ ei ] )  the signal @xmath37 is a delicate cancellation , it is necessary to ensure that the appropriate @xmath22 and @xmath42 are extracted * simultaneously * from the * same * lattice configuration . in this way",
    ", systematic errors possibly present in the separate energies @xmath22 and @xmath42 are expected to cancel to some extent .    in order to study different aspects of degenerate geometries , three separate sets of lattice calculations",
    "are performed in this paper .    1 .",
    "the first concentrates on geometries near to the tetrahedra ",
    "namely  those cases with @xmath43 ( except for @xmath44 , where only @xmath45 are treated ) .",
    "the data is collected into 69 blocks each containing 32 measurements i.e.  2208 measurements in all .",
    "the second set of geometries is for @xmath19 and @xmath46 to 5 i.e.situations close to that of the squares studied earlier in refs.@xcite@xcite . here",
    "the data is collected into 47 blocks each containing 64 measurements i.e.  3008 measurements in all .",
    "3 .   in order to see the connection between the present series of geometries  especially that in the previous item  and the square / rectangle geometry of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , a third set of runs is carried out .",
    "these are a repeat of the earlier square / rectangle geometry but with the complete 3 * 3 basis i.e.  with the inclusion of the basis state constructed from the diagonal paths .",
    "only a limited number of 64 measurements are made  4 blocks each containing 16 measurements .",
    "however , this is sufficient to see how the energies vary in going from the three 2 * 2 bases ( a+b , a+c and b+c ) to the complete a+b+c basis .",
    "as emphasized , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , care should be taken when analyzing data generated in monte carlo lattice calculations , in case the data between different euclidean times is too correlated .",
    "this can be taken into account in the following manner . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the actual quantities measured are the wilson loops @xmath47 between different states @xmath48 at different time intervals @xmath49 . here",
    "the @xmath48 refer to the different degrees of fuzzing for the two - quark potentials and , for the four - quark case , to the different quark partitions .",
    "however , the quantities of interest are the energies ( @xmath50 ) of these systems . in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite these were extracted by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "this matrix formulation takes into account mixing between the different degrees of fuzzing or four - quark partitions , but says nothing about possible correlations between the different times @xmath49 . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite it is convenient to treat the configuration and time correlations in the same manner . for clarity , this is illustrated by the specific example of @xmath54 partitions and @xmath55 time differences in the four - quark case .",
    "this involves the @xmath56 matrix elements @xmath57 , where the expected equality between , for example , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is not enforced by symmetrizing the data .",
    "let the index @xmath60 denote these @xmath61 matrices .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the data ( @xmath34 ) in the form of these @xmath56 matrix elements is collected into @xmath62 separate blocks , each of which is already the average of @xmath63 measurements i.e.  in all there are @xmath64 measurements of each wilson loop .",
    "the average of these measurements is denoted by @xmath65 the problem is now reduced to fitting these averages by a function of the general form @xmath66 in order to extract the energies @xmath67 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this can be achieved by minimizing the expression @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the covariance matrix @xmath71 in what follows , it is convenient to introduce the correlation matrix @xmath72 the above procedure is stable provided @xmath62 is large enough . however , in the present type of lattice calculation this is not guaranteed and can then lead to @xmath73 having very small eigenvalues that produce large fluctuations in @xmath74 . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , such eigenvalues correspond to eigenvectors that alternate in sign as a function of @xmath49 and so are not very relevant to smooth fit functions of the type proposed in eq .",
    "( [ fun ] ) .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to remove these disturbing eigenvalues and here the suggestion made in ref.@xcite is adopted .",
    "this simply replaces the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath73 by their average .",
    "the question then arises concerning how many @xmath75 of the original eigenvalues @xmath76 should be retained .",
    "initially a number @xmath77 of these @xmath78 eigenvalues are fixed  with @xmath77",
    "being chosen as @xmath79  a compromise choice found after some experimentation in ref .",
    "the average @xmath80 of the remaining @xmath81 eigenvalues is then made and those eigenvalues less than @xmath80 are replaced by @xmath80 itself . since only a fraction of the @xmath81 eigenvalues are replaced in this way , there still remains @xmath82 of the original eigenvalues . in practice",
    "the final value of @xmath83 is not strongly dependent on the original choice of @xmath77 . in the present problem @xmath84 , @xmath85 or 3 and",
    "@xmath86 can range from 1 to 5 , so that for the largest @xmath87 matrix only about 8 of the total number of 45 original eigenvalues should be retained .",
    "however , frequently the @xmath88 data are dropped from the analysis , since they have very small error bars and presumably contain the effect of several higher energy components that become negligible already at @xmath89 and so can not be seen for @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , keeping the @xmath88 data often makes it difficult to obtain an accurate fit with only a few ( 1    3 ) terms @xmath91 .",
    "having arrived at a suitable model for @xmath87 , it remains to fix the precise form of the function @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ fun ] ) , which is to fit the @xmath93 matrix elements @xmath94 by means of eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath92 are described by the @xmath95 potentials @xmath67 and the corresponding @xmath96 amplitudes @xmath97 i.e.  in all @xmath98 parameters . for the four - quark case the most reliable fits are found with three partitions @xmath99 and four time steps @xmath100 , which means 36 pieces of data are to be fitted with @xmath101 parameters .",
    "therefore , in principle only three potentials @xmath102 can at most be extracted .",
    "however , fitting 36 numbers ( some having significant error bars ) with 30 parameters ( @xmath103 ) would not succeed .",
    "in fact , even the extraction of two potentials using the 20 parameters ( @xmath104 ) would probably not give values of @xmath105 with a meaningful accuracy .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to impose some theoretical constraints to restrict the number ( @xmath96 ) of parameters @xmath97 .",
    "since the data @xmath106 involve the overlap of two lattice configurations @xmath107 and @xmath108 separated by time @xmath49 , it can be written as the vacuum expectation @xmath109    it is , therefore , reasonable to assume that the amplitudes are i.e.  @xmath110 .",
    "this has two good features :    \\1 ) the number of parameters is now reduced to @xmath111 . therefore , fitting the 36 pieces of data from three partitions @xmath99 and four time steps now only requires @xmath112 parameters .",
    "this makes the quite reliable extraction of two or possibly three potentials feasible .",
    "\\2 ) this parametrisation imposes the symmetry @xmath113 as is expected physically .",
    "as said earlier this symmetry was not forced on the original data by some procedure such as taking the average @xmath114 , since the differences between @xmath115 and @xmath116 can contribute to the error analysis of the extracted energies .",
    "it should be added that , in the event of two energy states being degenerate ( e.g.  @xmath117 ) , then @xmath118 should be replaced by a single amplitude @xmath119 .",
    "this is the situation encountered in the tetrahedron geometry .",
    "however , there additional symmetries suggest the following better model .    in some symmetrical cases , such as four quarks on the corners of a square or tetrahedron , the number of parameters can be further reduced by choosing forms of @xmath92 that guarantee various symmetries . for the square , when only the two partitions involving the sides are considered , the matrix of wilson loops has the form @xmath120 where not only is the general symmetry @xmath121 expected but also for a square @xmath122 . in this case",
    "( [ eig ] ) is easily solved to give for the lowest energy @xmath123 and for the energy of the first excited state @xmath124    therefore , in fitting the data it is reasonable to expect that only two potentials can be extracted i.e.  @xmath104 , and so the fitting functions must have the form @xmath125 @xmath126 this reduces the number of parameters to four [ @xmath127 in order to fit the 16 pieces of data covering four @xmath49 steps . here it should be remembered that the suffix @xmath128 on @xmath92 is fixed as @xmath129 .    similarly , for the tetrahedron the matrix of wilson loops has the form @xmath130 where the general symmetries @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 are expected and , in addition , there are the equalities @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the `` minus '' sign appearing in the last equation is a reminder that the quarks are in fact fermions even though quarks and antiquarks transform in the same way under su(2 ) .",
    "this point is discussed in more detail in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore ,",
    "in all , there are only two independent wilson loops @xmath137 and @xmath58 .",
    "again eq.([eig ] ) is easily solved to give for the lowest energy ( occurring twice ) @xmath138 and for the excited state @xmath139 in fitting the data it is reasonable to expect that only two terms can be extracted , i.e.  @xmath104 , and so the fitting functions must have the form @xmath140 @xmath141 this again reduces the number of parameters to four [ @xmath142 in order to fit the 12 pieces of data @xmath99 covering four @xmath49 steps . in this case ,",
    "due to the high symmetry there are no longer 36 pieces of independent data .    in the tetrahedral case it is also seen",
    "that , when one of the partitions is removed ( i.e.  @xmath54 drops from 3 to 2 ) , the wilson loop matrix reduces to the same form as that in eq .",
    "( [ nvs ] ) . as seen by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ 221 ] ) and ( [ 331 ] ) the lowest eigenvalue is now the * same * in the @xmath85 and 3 cases . however , the first excited state is quite different in the two cases  unlike the result for most other geometries .",
    "for example , as will be seen later in table [ t : square ] of section [ 4 ] , for squares and for those rectangles so far discussed , the @xmath85 and 3 cases give very similar results for @xmath143 as well as @xmath144 .",
    "however , there the third partition has a higher energy than the other two partitions , whereas for the tetrahedron all three partitions have the same energy .",
    "when the tetrahedron is distorted into a neighbouring lattice configuration , it will be seen in table [ tetresults1 ] of section [ 4 ] that both @xmath144 and @xmath143 can again be given quite accurately by @xmath54=2 .",
    "it should be added that for very elongated rectangles the two partitions with the highest energy become more and more degenerate . in that case",
    "@xmath144 is essentially zero and @xmath143 will depend more and more on the presence of the third partition .    in an idealised situation ,",
    "all of the available @xmath61 pieces of data from @xmath49=1 to 5 should  using the above procedure  be fitted with a @xmath92 containing @xmath145 potentials .",
    "this would then be the natural extension of eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) for incorporating into its @xmath54 eigenvalues the effects of correlations between different values of @xmath49 .",
    "as it now stands that equation only includes the mixing between the different fuzzing levels or partitions .",
    "however , in practice , fitting all the @xmath49 values is not possible and decisions have to be made concerning both the data ( @xmath115 ) to actually be fitted and , in the fitting procedure , the form of @xmath92 and also the model for the correlation matrix in eq .  ( [ corrm ] ) .",
    "\\a ) in the present problem , the data goes from @xmath49=1 to 5 and the number ( @xmath54 ) of fuzzings ( 2-quark ) or partitions ( 4-quark ) can range from 1 to 3 .",
    "for both the 2- and 4- quark systems usually @xmath49=2 to 5 turns out to be the most suitable range . when the @xmath49 range is reduced to 35 , better values of @xmath146",
