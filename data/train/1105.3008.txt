    "in recent years , a novel approach to quantum phase transitions ( pqts )  @xcite in quantum many - body lattice systems emerges , based on the fact that fidelity , a basic notion in quantum information science , is a measure of quantum state distinguishability  @xcite . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ground - state fidelity per lattice site captures drastic changes of the ground - state wave functions around a critical point for a quantum system in any spatial dimensions .",
    "that is , it is a universal marker to detect qpts , regardless of what type of the internal order is present .",
    "in fact , quantum many - body lattice systems with either spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) order or topological order , have been specifically studied : for the former , the examples include quantum transverse ising  @xcite and potts chains  @xcite , quantum ising  @xcite and xyx models  @xcite on a square lattice , while for the latter , the kitaev model  @xcite on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "remarkably , there is a smoking - gun signature for ssb order in the fidelity per site approach : ssb order implies a bifurcation , arising from degenerate ground - state wave functions due to broken symmetry , in the ground - state fidelity per lattice site .",
    "in fact , it was shown that , for a qpt arising from an ssb , a bifurcation appears in the ground - state fidelity per site , with a critical point identified as a bifurcation point .",
    "this in turn results in a novel concept of the universal order parameter , which appears as the ground - state fidelity per lattice site between a ground state and its symmetry - transformed counterpart .",
    "the advantage of the ground - state fidelity per lattice site and the universal order parameter  @xcite over local order parameters lies in the fact that both of them are universal , in the sense that it is not model - dependent , in contrast to model - dependant order parameters in characterizing qpts in quantum lattice many - body systems .",
    "similarly , a bifurcation occurs in the ground - state reduced fidelity  @xcite between the one - site reduced density matrices and the two - site reduced density matrices , with a critical point identified as a bifurcation point .",
    "however , all specific examples , up to now , have been restricted to quantum many - body lattice systems in one spatial dimension .    in this paper , we take one step further to see if these novel ideas are practical to quantum many - body lattice systems in two spatial dimensions .",
    "we establish , by exploiting the tensor network algorithm based on the infinite projected entangled - pair states ( ipeps ) algorithm  @xcite , an intriguing connection between a qpt and a bifurcation in the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , and construct the universal order parameter for quantum transverse ising model on a square lattice , a prototypical model with symmetry breaking order .",
    "our finding is applicable to any systems with symmetry breaking order , as a result of the fact that , in the conventional landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm , a quantum system undergoing a phase transition is characterized in terms of ssb captured by a local order parameter .",
    "in addition , a bifurcation in the reduced fidelity between two different reduced density matrices is also discussed .",
    "we consider quantum ising model in a transverse magnetic field on an infinite - size square lattice in two spatial dimensions .",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the spin @xmath2 pauli operators at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 runs over all the possible nearest - neighbor pairs on a square lattice , and @xmath5 is the transverse magnetic field , which we choose as a control parameter .",
    "the model is invariant under the symmetry operation : @xmath6 } \\rightarrow -\\sigma_{x}^{[i]}$ ] and @xmath7 } \\rightarrow \\sigma_{z}^{[i]}$ ] for all sites simultaneously , which yields the @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "as is well known , the system undergoes a second - order qpts at the critical field @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "for two ground - state wave functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponding to two different values @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the control parameter @xmath5 , the ground - state fidelity @xmath14 asymptotically scales as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the number of sites in the lattice . here , @xmath17 is the scaling parameter , introduced for one - dimensional quantum systems  @xcite and for two and higher - dimensional quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "note that it characterizes how fast fidelity goes to zero when the thermodynamic limit is approached .",
    "physically , the scaling parameter @xmath17 is the averaged fidelity per lattice site , which is well defined in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath18 as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , it satisfies the properties inherited from the fidelity @xmath19 : ( i ) normalization @xmath20 ; ( ii ) symmetry @xmath21 ; and ( iii ) range @xmath22 .    in the @xmath8 symmetric phase , the ground - state wave function is non - degenerate , while in the @xmath8 symmetry - broken phase , two degenerate ground - state wave functions arise . if we choose @xmath23 as a reference state , with @xmath24 in the @xmath8 symmetric phase , then the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath25 , is not able to distinguish two degenerate ground - state wave functions in the @xmath8 symmetry - broken phase",
    ". however , if we choose @xmath23 as a reference state , with @xmath24 in the @xmath8 symmetry - broken phase , then the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath26 , can be used to distinguish two degenerate ground - state wave functions .",
    "therefore , a bifurcation occurs in the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath26 , as a function of @xmath12 , for a fixed @xmath13 . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , for a given truncation dimension @xmath27 , a pseudo - phase - transition point @xmath28 manifests itself as a bifurcation point  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fidelity ] , we plot the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath29 , for quantum ising model in a transverse magnetic field on an infinite - size square lattice in two spatial dimensions , with the transverse magnetic field @xmath5 as the control parameter .",
    "note that a bifurcation does occur for the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath25 . here , we have chosen @xmath30 as a specific example .",
    "the pseudo - phase - transition point locates at @xmath31 for the truncation dimension @xmath32 , at @xmath33 for the truncation dimension @xmath34 , and at @xmath35 for the truncation dimension @xmath36 .",
    "we mention that the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath25 , is computed from the ipeps representation of the ground - state wave functions , following the transfer matrix approach described in ref.@xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the bifurcation points for the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , @xmath29 , as seen in fig .  [ fidelity ] , is that @xmath29 between different symmetry breaking ground - state wave functions in the same phase appears less than that between two ground - state wave functions from different phases .",
    "this is due to the fact that two degenerate symmetry breaking ground states in the same symmetry - broken phase are more distinguishable than two ground states from different phases .",
    "for quantum ising model in a transverse magnetic field on an infinite - size square lattice , the one - site reduced density matrix in the @xmath8 symmetric phase takes the form , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ground - state expectation value of @xmath39 in the @xmath8 symmetric phase , while the two - site reduced density matrix is , @xmath40 here , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the identity matrix .    in the @xmath8 symmetry - broken phase , the one - site reduced density matrix becomes , @xmath46 whereas the two - site reduced density matrix is @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .    the reduced fidelity measures the distance between two quantum mixed states . for",
    "two reduced density matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the reduced fidelity @xmath54 is defined to be  @xcite @xmath55 here , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the reduced density matrices corresponding to two different values , @xmath56 and @xmath24 , of the control parameter @xmath5 .",
    "notice that the reduced fidelity @xmath54 is a function of @xmath56 and @xmath24 , which satisfies the following properties : ( i ) normalization @xmath57 ; ( ii ) symmetry @xmath58 ; ( iii ) range 0@xmath591 .    in fig .",
    "[ one - site ] ( upper panel ) , we plot the ground - state reduced fidelity @xmath54 between the one - site reduced density matrices for quantum ising model in a transverse field on an infinite - size square lattice , with the transverse field strength @xmath5 as the control parameter . here , we choose @xmath53 , at @xmath30 , as a reference state , which breaks the @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "the one - site reduced fidelity is able to distinguish two mixed states ( described by two reduced density matrices ) from two degenerate ground - state wave functions , with a bifurcation point as a pseudo - phase - transition point @xmath28 . when the control parameter @xmath5 crosses a pseudo - transition point , the ground - state degeneracy changes suddenly , implying that the system undergoes a qpt .",
    "we observe that the pseudo - phase - transition point @xmath28 moves toward the critical point @xmath60 with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "more precisely , the pseudo - phase - transition point locates at @xmath31 for the truncation dimension @xmath32 , at @xmath33 for the truncation dimension @xmath34 , and at @xmath35 for the truncation dimension @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we also plot the ground - state reduced fidelity @xmath54 between the two - site reduced density matrices for quantum ising model in a transverse field on an infinite - size square lattice in fig .",
    "[ one - site](lower panel ) .",
    "the reference state is chosen at the same @xmath30 , as in the case of the one - site reduced fidelity .",
    "we observe that a bifurcation also occurs in the two - site reduced fidelity , with the same pseudo - phase - transition point @xmath28 .",
    "this is expected , simply because they are resulted from the same set of the ground - state wave functions .",
    "as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , for any quantum lattice system with a symmetry group @xmath61 undergoing a qpt with symmetry breaking order , there is a universal order parameter : it is defined as the ground state fidelity per lattice site between a ground - state wave function and its symmetry - transformed counterpart , which is discontinuous for first - order phase transitions and continuous for second - order phase transitions .",
    "this is based on the observation that , for any ground state @xmath62 in the symmetric phase , @xmath63 is equal to 1 , for any symmetry operation @xmath64 , whereas it is identical to zero for any state in the symmetry broken phase .    in order to measure the distance between two quantum states",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 , let us consider their counterparts @xmath67 and @xmath68 on a finite - size lattice , with @xmath69 being the number of the total lattice sites . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath70 asymptotically scales as @xmath71 with @xmath69 , as one may see from the tensor network representations of the system s ground state wave functions . here",
    ", @xmath72 is the averaged fidelity per lattice site , which is well - defined even in the thermodynamic limit . as such",
    ", one sees that , @xmath73 for any @xmath64 , if @xmath5 is in the symmetric phase @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for any nontrivial symmetry operation @xmath76 , if @xmath5 is in the symmetry - broken phase @xmath77 . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the universal order parameter to be @xmath78 note that @xmath79 is always zero if @xmath74 . however , it becomes nonzero , with its value ranging from 0 to 1 , if @xmath77 .",
    "these features are exactly what one requires for @xmath79 to be an order parameter .",
    "in fact , this is valid for any quantum many - body lattice system with a global symmetry group @xmath61 spontaneously broken .",
    "a remarkable feature of the universal order parameter is that it not only makes it possible to locate a critical point , but also enables us to identify a factorized state @xmath80 , with @xmath81 being the so - called factorizing field  @xcite .    in fig.[super ] , we plot the universal order parameter @xmath79 for quantum ising model in a transverse field on an infinite - size square lattice , with the field strength @xmath5 as the control parameter . here",
    ", the symmetry operation is the non - trivial element @xmath76 of the group @xmath82 . if @xmath83 , the universal order parameter @xmath79 is non - zero .",
    "this characterizes the @xmath8 symmetry - broken phase , in contrast to the fact that the universal order parameter @xmath79 is zero , in the symmetric phase @xmath84 .",
    "when the control parameter @xmath5 varies across the pseudo - critical point @xmath28 , the behavior of the universal order parameter @xmath79 changes qualitatively , implying that the system undergoes a qpt at the pseudo - phase - transition point @xmath28 .",
    "as the truncation dimension @xmath85 is increased , the pseudo - phase - transition point @xmath28 moves toward the critical point @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , the ( trivial ) factorizing field @xmath86 exists for quantum ising model in a transverse field on an infinite - size square lattice , at which @xmath79 reaches its maximum .",
    "we have investigated an intriguing connection between qpts and bifurcations in the ground - state fidelity per lattice site , in the context of the tensor network algorithm based on the ipeps representation . for quantum transverse ising model on an infinite - size square lattice , the ipeps algorithm produces two degenerate symmetry - breaking ground - state wave functions arising from the @xmath82 symmetry breaking , each of which results from a randomly chosen initial state .",
    "therefore , a quantum system undergoing a phase transition is characterized in terms of ssb that is captured by a bifurcation in the ground - state fidelity per lattice site .",
    "we have also constructed the universal order parameter , and discussed bifurcations in the ground - state reduced fidelity between two different reduced density matrices in the symmetry - broken phase , for quantum ising model in a transverse magnetic field on an infinite - size square lattice .",
    "we expect that our approach might provide further insights into critical phenomena in quantum many - body lattice systems in condensed matter .",
