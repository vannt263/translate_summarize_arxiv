    "recently a powerful instability which couples a high flux of cosmic rays to their host medium has been discovered ( bell 2004 , blasi & amato 2008 ) ; we refer to this as the `` bell instability . ''",
    "the instability amplifies low frequency , right circularly polarized electromagnetic fluctuations with wavenumber parallel to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "in contrast to the classical cyclotron resonant streaming instability ( wentzel 1968 , kulsrud & pearce 1969 ) , in which cosmic rays with lorentz factor @xmath0 amplify alfvn waves with wavelength of order the cosmic ray gyroradius @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the non - relativistic ion - cyclotron frequency ) , the characteristic wavelength of the bell instability is much less than @xmath3 .",
    "the bell instability is thought to be an important ingredient of diffusive shock acceleration in supernova remnants .",
    "it might be responsible for amplifying the magnetic field by up to @xmath4 orders of magnitude above its interstellar value and increasing the maximum energy to which cosmic rays can be accelerated , possibly up to the  knee \" at @xmath5ev ( drury 2005 , reville et al .",
    "this is an important result , because it has been known since the work of lagage & cesarsky ( 1983 ) that standard models of diffusive shock acceleration in the interstellar medium fail to reach the energy of the knee .",
    "although the bell instability has been applied primarily to supernova remnants , there are many other environments in which the cosmic ray flux may be large enough to excite it : galactic wind termination shocks , intergalactic shocks , and shocks in disks and jets .",
    "cosmic rays streaming away from local sources or from their host galaxies may also constitute a sufficient flux .",
    "if the bell instability exists in any of these environments it can amplify the magnetic field and transfer cosmic ray energy and momentum to the background plasma as well as increasing the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration . in view of our current uncertainty as to how galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields originated and are maintained",
    "( widrow 2002 , kulsrud & zweibel 2008 ) , any mechanism for amplifying them is of interest .",
    "because fluctuations generated by the bell instability have a definite helicity relative to the background magnetic field , they could be significant in amplifying the field at large scales ( pouquet et al .",
    "this paper assesses the conditions under which the bell instability , or more generally any rapidly growing , nonresonant electromagnetic streaming instability , can exist .    in order to excite the bell instability",
    ", the cosmic ray particle flux @xmath6 , thermal ion density @xmath7 , and alfven speed @xmath8 must satisfy the inequality ( as we show in  [ s : stdcase ] ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is of order the mean cosmic ray lorentz factor .",
    "this can be written in terms of the cosmic ray and magnetic energy densities @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 equations ( [ bellineq ] ) and ( [ ucrub ] ) express the requirement that the characteristic wavenumber of the bell instability be much greater than the reciprocal of the mean cosmic ray gyroradius @xmath14 .",
    "the bell instability was originally derived for a cold plasma , which is valid when the thermal ion and electron gyroradii @xmath15 , @xmath16 , are much less than the characteristic wavelength @xmath17 of the instability ; @xmath18 .",

    "we extend reville et al.s analysis to cases where @xmath19 is not small , include cyclotron damping , and investigate the properties of the instability by solving the plasma dispersion relation .",
    "the results are given schematically in figure  [ planesketch.eps ] and precisely for two representative environments , for @xmath25 , in ",
    "[ ss : regimes ] .",
    "equations ( [ bellineq ] ) and ( [ revilleineq ] ) define curves on the ( @xmath26 ) plane .",
    "we show that these two curves , together with the requirements @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , divide the @xmath30 plane into the domains delineated in the figure . first , we consider the case of @xmath31 :",
    "if the cosmic ray flux is too low , resonant streaming instabilities can be excited , but nonresonant instabilities of the bell or thermally modified bell type are precluded .",
    "the threshold flux depends only on @xmath32 and the ion density @xmath7 , and is independent of @xmath23 . above this threshold , but below a second threshold , defined by @xmath28 , the plane is divided into three regions . if @xmath23 is large enough that eqn .",

    "( [ revilleineq ] ) holds , there is nonresonant instability of the thermally modified type . the condition @xmath33 gives an upper limit to the flux at which nonresonant instability can be excited . above this flux ,",
    "the ions are unmagnetized and any instability which exists is driven solely by the electrons .",
    "this limit too , which is discussed further in  2 and in the appendix , is independent of @xmath23 and depends only on @xmath7 and @xmath32 . evaluating these limits numerically",
    ", we find that there is a broad range of cosmic ray flux and magnetic fieldstrength for which the instability operates efficiently , should mediate the transfer of cosmic ray momentum and energy to the background , and should be a powerful source of circularly polarized magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "in  [ s : setup ] we write down the general dispersion relation and solve it in various limits . in  [ s : applications ] we give quantitative versions of figure  [ planesketch.eps ] and apply the results to several different astrophysical environments .",
    "section [ s : summary ] is a summary and discussion .",
    "gaussian cgs units are used throughout .",
    "this paper is restricted to linear theory .",
    "the quasilinear and nonlinear evolution of the instability has been studied by a number of authors using both magnetohydrodynamic ( bell 2004 , 2005 , pelletier et al .",
    "2006 , zirakashvili et al . 2008 ) and kinetic models ( niemiec et al .",

    "a host of saturation mechanisms have been investigated , including increase of the fluctuation scale to @xmath34 , acceleration of the thermal plasma , coupling to stable or damped modes , and relaxation of the exciting beam .",
    "although understanding saturation is essential for predicting the outcomes of the instability , delineating the regimes in parameter space where the instability exists is the first step .",
    "we analyze the situation considered by bell ; a singly ionized plasma with ion number density @xmath7 and temperature @xmath35 .",
    "there is a uniform magnetic field @xmath36 and a population of proton cosmic rays with number density @xmath37 streaming along @xmath38 with speed @xmath24 relative to the thermal ions .",
    "we assume from now on that the mean lorentz factor @xmath10 of the cosmic rays is order unity .",
    "there are applications , such as a  layered \" shock precursor in which the most energetic particles have penetrated furthest upstream , where locally @xmath39 , and our results can be scaled readily to this situation ; that application is important for determining the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated .",
    "however , the instability will be excited by the bulk cosmic - ray population closer to the shock , which is important for field amplification .",
    "there are two populations of electrons , one with density @xmath7 which has no bulk velocity in the frame of the protons , and the other with density @xmath40 which drifts with the cosmic rays at speed @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the system is charge neutral and current free .",
    "this is the model used in zweibel ( 2003 ) and bell ( 2004 ) .",
    "amato & blasi ( 2009 ) have considered the bell instability when all the electrons drift at speed @xmath41 and found results similar to those obtained for the two electron populations assumed here .",
    "but although the bell instability in its original form is insensitive to the precise form of the thermal electron distribution function @xmath42 , it does turn out to depend on @xmath43 in a hot plasma .",
    "we briefly consider the constraints on @xmath43 in the appendix . based on an assessment of the electrostatic langmuir instability , we argue that for very large drifts and high cosmic ray densities , such as are expected in young supernova remnants expanding into diffuse interstellar gas , a separate electron beam with density @xmath40 and drift velocity @xmath24 is unstable , and would tend to relax . for more moderate shocks , or in outflows where the drift speed is less than the electron thermal velocity ,",
    "such a beam is stable . in general ,",
    "stability considerations alone do not determine @xmath43 .",
    "the fastest growing nonresonant cosmic rays streaming instabilities are sensitive to the precise form of @xmath43 only in a plasma so hot and/or weakly magnetized that the thermal ions do not respond .",
    "any instability present is then an instability of the electrons alone .",
    "its physical significance is unclear , since it depends on the form of @xmath43 .",
    "we are interested in right circularly polarized electromagnetic fluctuations which propagate parallel to @xmath38 and depend on @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath46 ; thus instability corresponds to @xmath47 .",

    "but even if @xmath197 , about an order of magnitude less than the disordered field estimated by rees ( 1987 ) to arise from a superposition of plerion supernova remnants in the early galaxy , the characteristic growth time of the instability is less than a year , much faster than the timescale on which the remnant evolves .    on the other hand , if the shock propagates in a hot , low density medium such as the superbubbles modelled by maclow & mccray ( 1988 ) , with @xmath198@xmath65 , @xmath199k , then according to eqn .",

    "the upper limit is only slightly less than the rms galactic field .",
    "the growth rate in the bell regime , @xmath204 , exceeds the advection rate through the cosmic ray scattering layer only for @xmath205 , suggesting that nonresonant instability is less important for shock acceleration in a low density medium than in a high density medium .",
    "the injection efficiency , rather than thermal effects , is the deciding factor : increasing @xmath134 above 10@xmath206 would enhance the growth rate in proportion .",

    "this is slightly less than the fields inferred in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , govoni & feretti 2004 ) , but the parameters are too uncertain to rule out resonant instability . according to eqn .",

    "due to the high temperature , the range in which the standard bell instability operates without thermal effects is quite small , but the growth rate of the thermally modified instability is still fast .",

    "although the instability growth rates are lower than for supernova remnants , they are still large enough to satisfy this condition in both the standard and thermally modified nonresonant regimes .",
    "thus , it appears that nonresonant instabilities could play a role in shock acceleration , and could amplify magnetic fields , in galaxy clusters .",
    "this could make intergalactic shocks a favorable environment for acceleration of ultra high energy cosmic rays .      as our final example , we consider leakage of cosmic rays from galaxies into the intergalactic medium , which we take to have density and temperature @xmath222@xmath65 , @xmath61k ( richter et al .",

    "the growth rates , however , are rather slow . for example , if @xmath232 , @xmath233 . in this case , @xmath234 g ; for @xmath235 g , the maximum growth rate is about @xmath236 s@xmath68 . still , although the growth time exceeds 10@xmath237 years , this is much shorter than any reasonable cosmic ray convection time .",
    "therefore , nonresonant instabilities could be excited by cosmic rays from ordinary galaxies in the intergalactic medium at large .",
    "they could amplify intergalactic magnetic fields , and could heat the plasma .",
    "nonresonant instability driven by cosmic ray streaming has emerged as a strong candidate for amplification of magnetic fields in environments such as strong shock waves , where the cosmic ray flux is large ( bell 2004 ) .",
    "when the flux is high enough and/or the magnetic field is low enough , that eqn .",
    "( [ bellineq ] ) is violated , the nonresonant instability replaces the classical resonant streaming instability as the dominant electromagnetic instability generated by cosmic rays .",
    "although the instability scale length predicted by linear theory is small even compared to the cosmic ray gyroradius @xmath3 , nonlinear simulations suggest that as the amplitude of the instability grows it generates fluctations at larger scales .",
    "this can increase the energy to which particles are accelerated in shocks .",
    "cosmic ray acceleration and magnetic field growth are both of interest in a variety of environments , including young galaxies which may be actively forming stars but have not yet built up magnetic fields , shocks in galaxy clusters , and the intergalactic medium at large . in this paper",
    "we have carried out a parameter study of nonresonant instabilities including ion thermal effects .",
    "we solved the full dispersion relation ( [ fulldr ] ) numerically and verified that a simple analytical approximation , eqn .",
    "( [ wicedr ] ) , is quite accurate in the wavenumber regime of interest .",
    "we corroborated the criterion of reville et al .",
    "( 2008b ) for when ion gyroviscosity reduces the instability growth rate and shifts it to longer wavelength .",
    "we showed that ion cyclotron damping cuts off the instability at short wavelengths and argued that at wavelengths short enough that the ions are unmagnetized the instability depends only on the electron distribution function , the prediction of which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the joint requirements that the instability wavelength be much less than the cosmic ray gyroradius but much more than the thermal ion gyroradius limits the range of fluxes which excite nonresonant instability to @xmath238 . in practical terms , this range is large and accommodates most cases of interest . within the unstable range , there is a  strong field \" regime in which all streaming instabilities are resonant , an  intermediate \" regime in which nonresonant instability in the form derived by bell dominates , and a  weak field \" regime in which the instability is thermally modified . in the bell regime the maximum growth rate is independent of @xmath23 but in the thermally modified regime it depends linearly on @xmath23",
    ". young galactic supernova remnants are generally in the intermediate regime unless the ambient medium is hot and rarefied ( like the interior of a superbubble ) , in which case the instability is weakened .",
    "generally , if @xmath23 is in the nanogauss range , the growthrates are fast enough for nonresonant instability to be a potential source of magnetic field amplification in weakly magnetized interstellar and intergalactic gas . at much lower fieldstrengths ,",
    "the instability is too slow to be of interest , but other instabilities , such as weibel modes , could be an important ingredient in magnetogenesis ( medvedev et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "although nonresonant instabilities amplify magnetic fields on rather small scales - much smaller than the eddy scales characteristic of interstellar and intergalactic turbulence - they should not be ignored in discussions of magnetogenesis .",
    "because only the right circularly polarized modes are unstable , nonresonant instabilities are a source of magnetic helicity on scales at which the background magnetic field is coherent .",
    "magnetic helicity is thought to be a key ingredient in the growth of large scale magnetic fields from small scale fluctuations ( pouquet et al .",
    "cosmic ray generated fluctuations could be important in driving an inverse cascade of magnetic power to longer wavelengths , and could prevent the pileup of power at short wavelengths that currently confounds interstellar and intergalactic dynamo theories .",
