    "that hera data was to change our understanding of pqcd was announced at the durham phenomenology workshop on hera physics in 1993 ( the first of three devoted to hera physics , all with a large input from jk ) .",
    "albert de roeck presented the first preliminary h1 data from hera on @xmath1 measurements at @xmath2 , below the fixed target region . within large errors that data showed a rising @xmath1",
    "as @xmath0 decreased  the quality of the data may be judged from fig  [ fig : f2-z93 ] showing comparable zeus data .",
    "the result was the major talking point of the 1993 hera workshop and discussion has continued almost unabated since then .",
    "one gets a sense of why the result was surprising by comparing fig  [ fig : f2-z93 ] with fig  [ fig : akms - f2 ] .",
    "the latter plot shows a range of predictions from a paper by askew , martin , kwiecinski & sutton ( akms ) @xcite with @xmath1 data from the nmc and bcdms experiments for @xmath3 .",
    "the least model - dependent extrapolation from the measured data would appear give a ` flat ' @xmath1 as @xmath4 as shown by the dash - dotted curve , but what do the rising curves represent ?",
    "a rising @xmath1 at small-@xmath0 is predicted by pqcd , but the predictions do not give a scale in either @xmath0 or @xmath5 at which one might expect to see such effects .    in the dglap formalism at leading order the gluon splitting functions @xmath6 are singular as @xmath7 .",
    "thus the gluon distribution will become large as @xmath8 , and its contribution to the evolution of the parton distribution becomes dominant .",
    "in particular the gluon will ` drive ' the quark singlet distribution , and hence the structure function @xmath1 , to become large as well , the rise increasing in steepness as @xmath5 increases .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath9 may be solved subject to the nature of the boundary function @xmath10 .",
    "inputting a non - singular gluon at @xmath11 , the solution is  @xcite @xmath12 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right ) \\label{eq : dllag}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 given a long enough evolution length from @xmath11 to @xmath5 , this will generate a steeply rising gluon distribution at small @xmath0 , starting from a flattish behaviour of @xmath14 at @xmath15 .    over the @xmath16 range of hera data",
    "this solution mimics a power behaviour , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "this steep behaviour of the gluon generates a similarly steep behaviour of @xmath1 at small @xmath0 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "so why was the observed rise of @xmath1 unexpected ?",
    "because , before the advent of hera data , the starting scale for perturbative evolution had always been taken to be @xmath23gev@xmath24 , to be sure that a perturbative calculation would be valid .",
    "the evolution length from @xmath5 of 4 to @xmath25gev@xmath24 is not large enough to generate a steep slope from a flat input .",
    "however jan kwiecinski together with martin , roberts and stirling @xcite had already been considering alternatives to ` conventional ' dglap with flat input distribution .",
    "the kmrsb@xmath26 and kmrsb@xmath27 parton distribution functions of 1990 @xcite were both compatible with the data : kmrsb@xmath26 had a conventional flat gluon distribution input at @xmath28gev@xmath24 ; whereas kmrsb@xmath27 had a singular gluon distribution @xmath29 , even at low @xmath30 ) .",
    "why should one consider a steep input gluon ? . because at small @xmath0 terms in @xmath31 are becoming large and the conventional _",
    "leading @xmath32 _ summation of the dglap equations does not account for this .",
    "it may also be necessary to sum _ leading @xmath31 _ terms .",
    "such a summation is performed by the bfkl factorization .",
    "] equation . to leading order in @xmath31 with fixed @xmath33 ,",
    "this predicts a steep power law behaviour @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 , as appropriate for @xmath37gev@xmath24 ) .",
    "these ideas were taken further in the paper by akms , see fig .",
    "[ fig : akms - f2 ] , in which bfkl evolution was incorporated directly into the calculation of the parton densities .",
    "the rising curves show different calculations of @xmath1 and @xmath38 from the bfkl equation , the dashed curves show the effect of including some damping by shadowing which will be discussed later .",
    "the dash - dotted curve is the prediction for the structure functions without bfkl effects .",
    "thus the observation of a steep behaviour in @xmath1 at a relatively low @xmath5 was seized upon by those who saw this as evidence for bfkl .",
    "on the other hand it was quickly realised that by lowering the starting scale in the dglap approach to @xmath39gev@xmath24 one could also fit the data without a singular gluon input distribution .",
    "this later approach owed much to the work of glck , reya and vogt ( grv ) @xcite .",
    "higher statistics data taken during 1993 showed that an effective power @xmath40 was actually too steep .",
    "kwiecinski was involved with many of the approaches to find a credible phenomenology of the bfkl equation .",
    "one of the most significant of these is the need for a ` kinematic constraint ' to control the diffusion of transverse momentum down the ` gluon ladder ' in the bfkl approach ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] ) .",
    "unlike the dglap summation in which the @xmath41 of the ladder are strictly ordered , those in the bfkl summation are not and can diffuse downwards into the non - perturbative region .",
    "consider a link in the gluon chain where the longitudinal momentum fraction decreases from @xmath42 to @xmath0 and the transverse momentum @xmath43 changes to @xmath41 , with emission of a gluon of transverse momentum @xmath44 .",
    "one requires @xmath45 in order that the virtuality of exchanged gluons is controlled by their transverse momenta .",
    "this implies that @xmath46 , for any given value of @xmath41 .",
    "if one considers the effect of this constraint on the solutions for the bfkl equation one finds that it modifies the asymptotic solution @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 is reduced from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "these ideas were built into an ambitious approach by kwiecinski , martin and stasto @xcite to combine the bfkl and dglap approaches in a single model to be applied to the hera and fixed target data .",
    "the key idea was to use the bfkl kernel , with the kinematic constraint , applied to the unintegrated gluon density ( i.e. differential in @xmath41 as well as @xmath0 ) to give an input gluon density to dglap evolution .",
    "this gives rise to a pair of coupled equations for the gluon and @xmath51 sea which can be solved numerically .",
    "the small valence quark contribution was taken from the leading order grv set @xcite to give a complete model for @xmath1 , @xmath52 and @xmath38 .",
    "only two parameters were needed to describe @xmath53 at the starting scale .",
    "a very good fit to the hera 1994 @xmath1 data together with data from e665 , bcdms and nmc was obtained , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kms - fg3 ] .    during the period @xmath54 the conventional dglap nlo qcd global fits",
    "were also refined and gave very good @xmath55 fits to the hera data , starting with a conventional flat gluon input , provided that a low starting scale @xmath56gev@xmath24 was used . in 1996",
    "the hera data from the 1994 run were published , showing that that the steep slope of @xmath1 extended as far down in @xmath5 as @xmath57gev@xmath24 .",
    "the precision of the data had now increased sufficiently that the low-@xmath0 behaviour of the sea and the gluon distributions could be fitted separately .",
    "these results led to a new kind of surprise since it became clear that the flat input which had been used for both the sea and the gluon ( @xmath58 ) was actually a compromise between a sea distribution which remains steep , @xmath59 down to @xmath60gev@xmath24 , and a gluon distribution which is becoming valence - like , @xmath61 at low @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : glusea ] shows a recent result from a zeus global fit using the complete hera - i data sample @xcite .",
    "this behaviour contradicts the original argument that the steep behaviour of the gluon distribution is driving the steep behaviour of the sea which is measured in @xmath1 .",
    "these conclusion were strengthened when the data from the 1996/7 runs were published in 2000/2001 .",
    "it became possible to make detailed analyses of the experimental uncertainties on the parton distributions and thus put limits on the kinematic range of applicability of the dglap formalism .",
    "for @xmath62gev@xmath24 the gluon distribution becomes negative at small @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : glusea ] and the fit can no longer describe the data , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowq2 ] . furthermore , even though the dglap formalism works for @xmath63gev@xmath24 , doubts remain about its applicability when @xmath64 . with only one observable measured with high precision and all models depending on parameters fit to data",
    ", one has sufficient flexibility to get good descriptions in both the pure dglap and ` bfkl enhanced ' approaches .",
    "the striking rise in @xmath1 does begin to abate for @xmath5 below @xmath65gev@xmath24 as fig .",
    "[ fig : lowq2 ] illustrates . at this point",
    "is useful to bring in data on the slopes or derivatives of @xmath1 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1 may be characterized in terms of two slopes , with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the latter has already been used in the discussion of the gluon density at low @xmath0 , here @xmath66 or @xmath67 . at low @xmath0",
    "the form of the dglap equations is such that at lo one has ( very roughly ) @xmath68    thus the behaviour of @xmath69 may come from either the gluon density or the splitting function or both . if it could be shown that any unconventional behaviour was attributable to @xmath70 then this would indicate the need for an alternative evolution equation . in any case",
    "it is well worthwhile the experimental groups calculating the two slopes with a proper treatment of systematic errors .",
    "@xmath71  the ` caldwell plot ' as a function of @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : df2dlnq2 ] .",
    "this is another result from hera that caused a lot of interest and discussion !",
    "the plot shows the slopes calculated from the @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kms - fg3 ] . an important detail to note",
    "is that because of the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 inherent in deep inelastic kinematics , the slopes are not evaluated at a fixed values of @xmath5 , but rather at the mean values shown along the top of the plot for each data point .",
    "the plot shows that the rate of rise of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath5 is starting to abate as @xmath72 and @xmath73gev@xmath24 . to understand what the plot might indicate and why one is also very interested in where and how @xmath1 stops rising at low @xmath0 it is helpful to look at the hera data from another point of view",
    "the strong rise of @xmath1 at low @xmath0 was unexpected for another reason . at small @xmath0 , @xmath1",
    "is related to the cross - section for @xmath75 scattering by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath75 centre of mass energy .",
    "this relation implies that a rise of @xmath1 at small-@xmath0 corresponds to a rising @xmath78 cross - section with @xmath79 .",
    "the relationship above suggests another approach to understanding the behaviour of @xmath1 at low @xmath0 and that is the framework of regge theory used to explain the high energy behaviour of hadronic total cross - sections .",
    "regge theory predicts that the high energy behaviour of hadronic scattering amplitudes is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the intercept of a regge trajectory which has the right quantum numbers for an exchange in the crossed channel @xmath82 . using the optical theorem",
    ", a total cross - section will vary as @xmath83 . for the corresponding forward elastic scattering amplitude",
    ", the leading regge trajectory has the quantum numbers of the vacuum and is known as the pomeron , for which the value @xmath84 has been determined from hadron - hadron data .",
    "this prediction also describes the high energy behaviour of photoproduction cross - section measurements successfully .",
    "the model was extended to describe virtual - photon proton scattering by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite who assumed that the @xmath5 dependence would reside in the residue functions @xmath85 only and that the intercepts , @xmath81 would be independent of @xmath5 . through eq .",
    "[ eq : sigf2 ] this approach then predicts a flattish input for the gluon and sea pdfs , since @xmath86 implies @xmath87 .",
    "while the dl approach successfully described the pre - hera low @xmath0 data for @xmath5 values up to about @xmath88gev@xmath24 , it can not describe the steeply rising @xmath1 data measured at hera .",
    "the problem is summarised graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdaeff ] which shows @xmath89 or @xmath90 , at low @xmath0 . for @xmath5 values",
    "less than @xmath91gev@xmath24 or so , the value of @xmath92 is consistent with that from hadronic regge theory , whereas for @xmath93gev@xmath24 the slope rises steadily to reach a value greater than @xmath94 by @xmath95gev@xmath24 .",
    "this larger value of @xmath92 is not so far from that expected using bfkl ideas .",
    "indeed the bfkl equation can be viewed as a method for calculating the hard or perturbative pomeron trajectory  in contrast to the soft or non - perturbative pomeron of hadronic physics with intercept around @xmath96 .",
    "donnachie and landshoff @xcite have extended their regge model by the addition of a hard pomeron with intercept @xmath97 , which allows them to describe the low @xmath0 hera data up to @xmath5 values of a few hundred gev@xmath24 .",
    "theirs is one of many attempts , using ideas from regge theory , to model the ` transition region ' from real photoproduction through to deep inelastic scattering with @xmath98gev@xmath24 .",
    "either considering the rise of @xmath1 as @xmath4 or the steep energy dependence of @xmath74 at large @xmath5 , such behaviour will eventually violate the froissart bound .",
    "if the origin of the rise arises from a high gluon density then this problem may be avoided because the gluons can shadow each other from the @xmath99 . at even higher densities the gluons will ` recombine ' via the process @xmath100  the inverse of gluon splitting  and the gluon density and hence @xmath1 will saturate .",
    "these ideas have been formalized by gribov , levin & ryskin by the addition of a non - linear term to the equation for gluon evolution @xmath101 ^ 2\\ ] ] when @xmath102 the non - linear term cancels the linear term and evolution stops , this is saturation . shadowing effects were included in the calculations by akms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : akms - f2 ] and in the kmrs parton densities .",
    "the various evolution equations applicable across the @xmath16 plane are summarised schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : admmap ] .",
    "qcd at the 1993 durham workshop @xcite . ]",
    "note the appearance of the ` critical line ' above which the gluon density is high enough for non - linear effects to be important . in this region and for large enough @xmath5 one has the possibility that @xmath33 will be small enough for weak - coupling but non - perturbative methods to be applicable , of which the glr equation could be a first approximation . again",
    "no scales are given and another of many hotly argued questions raised by the hera data  for example in the context of the caldwell plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : df2dlnq2 ] )  is does hera have the reach to see saturation effects and have they been seen ?",
    "dipole models have proved to be a very fruitful approach in exploring this question and modelling the behaviour of @xmath1 or @xmath74 through the transition region towards @xmath103 .",
    "the idea is that the virtual photon splits into a @xmath104 pair . ]",
    "( a colour dipole ) with a transverse size @xmath105 , the splitting occurring a ` long ' time @xmath106 before the dipole interacts with the proton .",
    "the dipole then scatters coherently from the proton in a time which is short in comparison to @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 process is described by qed and the strong interaction physics is then contained in the cross - section , @xmath108 , for the dipole - proton interaction .",
    "many authors have worked on these models in the context of dis processes both inclusive and for diffraction . here",
    "the discussion will focus on the model of golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) @xcite .",
    "the original gbw model provides a simple parameterization of @xmath108 with explicit saturation , in the sense that @xmath109 ( a constant ) as @xmath110 becomes large , but in a such a way that the approach to saturation is @xmath0 dependent , controlled by the ` saturation radius ' , @xmath111 .",
    "explicitly the dipole cross - section is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a constant , and @xmath114 @xmath115 is understood to be inversely proportional to the gluon density ( @xmath116 ) , so that @xmath111 is a measure of the transverse separation of the gluons in the target .",
    "thus when the dipole separation is large compared to the gluon separation ( small @xmath5 and small @xmath0 ) the dipole cross - section saturates , @xmath117 , and @xmath74 also tends to a constant , giving @xmath118 from eq .",
    "[ eq : sigf2 ] . when the dipole separation is small compared to the gluon separation ( high @xmath5 and large @xmath0 ) , @xmath119 and @xmath74 varies as @xmath120 , so that @xmath1 exhibits bjorken scaling .",
    "because of the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath111 , @xmath108 saturates for smaller dipoles sizes as @xmath0 decreases .    looking at fig .  [",
    "fig : gbw - f2 ] , which shows @xmath1 as a function of @xmath5 at fixed @xmath121 , one sees that the data do exhibit these features .",
    "there is a clear change in behaviour around @xmath122gev@xmath24 , which might then be taken as a rough estimate of the saturation scale for hera data .",
    "however , one needs to be somewhat careful before jumping to the conclusion that the gbw dipole model shows that saturation effects have been seen at hera . given eq .",
    "[ eq : sigf2 ] , @xmath123 at low @xmath5 is required in any model since the photoproduction cross - section is finite and slow , logarithmic scale breaking at high @xmath5 is required by pqcd .",
    "thus the real challenge is not in describing the general behaviour but in describing the exact shape of the data across the transition , now that high precision data are available .",
    "it should also be noted that there are other dipole models that fit the same data as successfully without an explicit @xmath0 dependent saturation scale .",
    "although it gave a good description of @xmath1 at low @xmath5 , the original gbw model did not include qcd evolution in @xmath5 and this limited its success at larger @xmath5 .",
    "this deficiency was corrected in a second version @xcite in which @xmath108 was related to the gluon density .",
    "results from both versions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gbw - f2 ] .",
    "another feature of saturation models which is illustrated in the gbw model is the dependence of the dipole cross - section on a scaled variable , here @xmath124 .",
    "stasto , golec - biernat and kwiecinski @xcite have made the interesting observation that this leads to a new scaling property of @xmath125 . at low @xmath0",
    ", @xmath125 should depend only on the dimensionless variable @xmath126 .",
    "what is more , such a scaling property seems to be satisfied by hera data .",
    "one expects @xmath127 fig .",
    "[ fig : gscal ] shows hera data with @xmath2 as a function of @xmath128 .",
    "not only do the data show this scaling very clearly , but also the expected change in behaviour indicated above seems to occur around values of @xmath129 . this new scaling  _ geometrical scaling _",
    " holds for @xmath5 values up to about @xmath130gev@xmath24 but only for @xmath2 .",
    "again , though it is not a proof , the remarkable demonstration of geometrical scaling by the low @xmath0 hera data does show that they have many of the attributes of a saturated system .",
    "the low @xmath0 data from hera have produced many surprising and interesting results that can be understood in the perturbative dynamics of a gluon rich system , although details such as exactly how to include bfkl effects are as yet undecided . whether saturation effects have been demonstrated at hera is controversial , but whatever the answer to this question one can not deny the importance of the measurements in stimulating activity in this area .",
    "particularly encouraging are the attempts to describe high density gluon dynamics in terms of semi - classical models ",
