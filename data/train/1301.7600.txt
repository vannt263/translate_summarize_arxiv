    "quantum correlations , such as entanglement and quantum discord , are assumed to be resources in quantum information processing and are different from classical correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "in general , entanglement and discord are different from each other .",
    "previous studies focus on entanglement which is a special quantum correlation enabling fascinating quantum information tasks such as super - dense coding@xcite , teleportation@xcite , quantum cryptography@xcite , remote - state preparation@xcite and so on .",
    "however , some quantum applications superior than their classical counterparts are found with vanishing or negligible entanglement @xcite . in this sense , entanglement seems not capture all the quantum features of quantum correlations .",
    "so other measures of quantum correlations are proposed . among those measures that in general go beyond entanglement , quantum discord is a widely accepted one in recent years @xcite .",
    "the analytic results of quantum discord and its physical meaning are studied extensively , for example , in refs . @xcite .",
    "the experiments about quantum discord are implemented @xcite .",
    "quantum discord can also be generalized to the multipartite situation @xcite , for more results , see a recent review paper @xcite .",
    "there are many fundamental differences between classical correlation and quantum correlations .",
    "one of them is the shareability of correlation among many parties . generally speaking",
    ", classical correlation can be freely shared among many parties , while quantum ones do not have this property .",
    "for example , for tripartite pure state , if two parties are highly entangled , they can not have a large amount of entanglement shared with a third one .",
    "the limits on the shareability of quantum correlations are described by monogamy inequalities .",
    "much progresses have already been made about the monogamy properties of various quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "as one application , the monogamy property of quantum correlations also play a fundamental role for the security of the quantum key distributions@xcite .",
    "some known monogamy properties of entanglement measure are , for example , concurrence and squashed entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the monogamy relation does not always be satisfied by the quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "so it is necessary to know when a specified quantum correlation can satisfy this property .",
    "concerning about quantum discord , in general , it does not satisfy this nature @xcite .",
    "however , it may have some interesting applications in case the monogamy condition is satisfied @xcite .",
    "we should note that there are two types of monogamy inequalities for quantum discord since it is asymmetric depending on the measurement side for a bipartite state @xcite . a necessary and sufficient condition for one type of monogamy relation satisfying",
    "is given where only one side of measurement is studied @xcite .",
    "a natural question is then that does there exist an analogous property for another class of monogamy with measurement taken on a different side ? in this paper ,",
    "we first demonstrate a relation between those two types of monogamy conditions for tripartite pure state and provide the difference between them . by using this relation",
    ", we provide an unified physical interpretation for these two monogamy deficit and generalize it to the @xmath0-partite pure state .",
    "then we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the holding of the second type of monogamy relation and further generalize the result to the @xmath0-partite system .",
    "in particular , those two types of monogamy relations are generally studied independently .",
    "our result that two monogamy inequalities can be combined together by introducing monogamy deficit provides a new , in general , more complete viewpoint .",
    "this can enlighten much research both on quantum correlation and monogamy property .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , after introducing the definition of monogamy deficit , we derive a relation between these two types of monogamy deficit for tripartite pure state .",
    "using thisn unified physical interpretation for these two monogamy deficit .",
    "in addition , we find an interesting fact that there is a general monogamy condition for several quantum correlations for tripartite pure states .",
    "then , we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the non - negative second monogamy deficit for tripartite mixed state .",
    "we also use a figure to illustrate the monogamy deficit under specific pure state . by considering the equivalent expression of the necessary and sufficient condition for tripartite pure state",
    ", we obtain a new physical interpretation of entanglement of formation .",
    "finally , as an further application of the above necessary and sufficient condition , we extend our result to the @xmath0 partite system .",
    "quantum discord is defined as the difference between mutual information , which is accepted to be the total correlation , and maximum classical mutual information @xcite @xmath1 where arrow `` @xmath2 '' means measurement on @xmath3 and `` @xmath4 '' means measurement on @xmath5 , @xmath6 represent povm measurement performed on @xmath7 for a bipartite state @xmath8 .",
    "so quantum discord is considered describing the quantumness of correlations . in this paper",
    ", we mainly use the same notations as those in ref.@xcite .",
    "we use the left arrow ( `` @xmath4 '' ) and the right arrow ( `` @xmath2 '' ) to distinguish the side of the measurement .",
    "also we have notations , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , here @xmath11 is the von neumann entropy of a density matrix @xmath12 . by those definitions presented above , we know that quantum discord in general should be asymmetric and depend on the measurement side , which can be either @xmath7 or @xmath13 .",
    "it is understandable that those two definitions possess different fundamental properties .",
    "recently , two kinds of monogamy inequalities have been studied in refs.@xcite and @xcite . for a tripartite state @xmath14 , by combining two monogamy inequalities together ,",
    "we define two kinds of monogamy deficit of quantum discord , @xmath15 @xmath16 it is worth noting that a similar quantity as defined in eq .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) has also been introduced by bera _",
    "_ @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ monogam1 ] ) , the first term @xmath17 involves a positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) performed on @xmath13 and @xmath18 , and the other involve measurements only on @xmath7 .    because of the asymmetry of quantum discord , the above two monogamy deficit are apparently quite different . in this paper , however , we find that there is a relation between them , which means that the monogamy relations on one of them provide some limits on another .",
    "we first have a following observation . for two kinds of monogamy deficit @xmath19 , @xmath20 of an arbitrary tripartite pure state @xmath14 , we find , @xmath21 the proof of those two relations can be the following",
    ". for simplicity , denote @xmath22 as the optimal conditional entropy of @xmath23 after the measurement which defined as @xmath24 , that is @xmath25 . using the koashi - winter formula @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath26 , where @xmath27 means the entanglement of formation for a bipartite state @xmath28 .",
    "generally , for any tripartite pure state @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 correspond to any permutations of @xmath32 . further more , we find ,",
    "@xmath33 inserting ( [ left ] ) into ( [ monogam1]),([monogamyde ] ) , we have that @xmath34 similarly , @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be obtained by permutating the indices of ( [ monogam1 ] ) and ( [ monogamyde ] ) . combining those results , we have ( [ 1deficit ] ) , ( [ relation ] ) , which completes the proof .",
    "the above relations are interesting .",
    "they tell us that the two kinds of monogamy inequalities which was studied previously @xcite actually are not independent .",
    "we find that @xmath19 , which is the defined monogamy deficit having a coherent measurement taken on two parties @xmath13 and @xmath18 , is precisely equal to the arithmetic mean of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in which the measurements are only performed individually on @xmath13 and @xmath18 . to be explicit , the measurement for left hand side ( l.h.s . ) of equality ( [ 1deficit ] ) is a coherent measurement on `` @xmath39 '' while on right hand side ( r.h.s . ) , local measurements on `` @xmath13 '' and `` @xmath18 '' are performed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a transition from satisfying the monogamy inequality to violation of monogamy inequality is given , where the positive or negative of @xmath19 are studied . by the definition of monogamy deficit @xmath40 ,",
    "it is apparent that a coherent measurement on `` @xmath39 '' is necessary . here",
    "our result ( [ 1deficit ] ) shows that instead of a coherent measurement , local measurements individually on `` @xmath13 '' and `` @xmath18 '' can be performed to find this conclusion .",
    "we remark that local operation is much easier to be implemented than coherent measurement .",
    "those results reveal the hidden relationship in monogamy deficit for quantum discord where the coherent measurement is replaced by local measurements .    in the previous paragraphs",
    ", we have already discussed the relationship between these two monogamy deficit .",
    "now let us consider the difference between them .",
    "the difference between the two monogamy deficit can be expressed as the following form @xmath41 where the @xmath42 is the average of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "here we give a simple proof of the above formula . by using the koashi - winter relation",
    ", we have @xmath45 @xmath46 by subtracting the above equalities , we have @xmath47 by exchanging the symbols of @xmath7 and @xmath13 , we have the similar equation @xmath48 combining the above formulas , the @xmath49 - @xmath42 can be expressed as follows @xmath50 substituting ( [ 1deficit ] ) and ( [ relation ] ) into the above equation , we have eq.([deiference ] ) , which completes the proof .",
    "this formula is meaningful , it shows that the difference between these two monogamy deficit depends on the balance of entanglement of formation ( eof ) and the average of discord . in other words ,",
    "if the eof between @xmath7 and @xmath13 is greater than or equal to the average of discord , the first monogamy deficit which contains measurements on @xmath7 and @xmath13 must be greater than or equal to the second monogamy deficit which only contains local measurement on @xmath18 . especially when @xmath49 is equal to the @xmath42 , these two monogamy deficit is equivalent . in other words , in this case , when we consider the monogamy property of quantum discord , we only need to know one of them .",
    "since the second monogamy deficit only contains local measurement on one party , it is easier to calculate and to be used in practical applications .",
    "furthermore , the above formula provides a new physical interpretation of the difference between eof and discord in the average sense .",
    "as an application of the relationship between the two monogamy deficit , for tripartite pure states , we provide an unified physical significance for these two monogamy deficit . to see this , we first consider the equivalent expression of the second monogamy deficit .",
    "according to the results in @xcite and @xcite , we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "combing the two equations , we have that @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents the classical correlation , @xmath43 represents quantum discord . by exchanging the subscript , we have @xmath55 .",
    "it tells us that this monogamy deficit is equivalent to the difference between classical correlation and quantum correlation . since the classical correlation can be regarded as locally accessible mutual information ( lami)@xcite , while the quantum correlation can be seen as locally inaccessible mutual information ( limi ) . in this sense , this monogamy deficit tells us that how much mutual information can be extracted from a tripartite pure state by using local measurement on one party . to be more explicit",
    ", the monogamy inequality holds if and only if more than half of the mutual information between @xmath56 or @xmath39 can be accessed through local measurement performed on @xmath18 .",
    "the above result provides a interesting relationship between the second monogamy deficit and the difference between lami and limi for arbitrary tripartite pure states . in the following ,",
    "we generalize the relationship to arbitrary @xmath0-partite pure states . for arbitrary @xmath0-partite pure states @xmath57",
    ", we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 represent the second monogamy deficit for arbitrary @xmath0-partite pure state and is given by @xmath60 similarly , the second monogamy deficit @xmath61 for its @xmath62-partite subsystem is @xmath63 so we have @xmath64 using the koashi - winter relationship and considering the property of pure states , it is easy to show @xmath65 since @xmath66 for pure state , the above results can be rewritten as follows @xmath67 which completes the proof .",
    "this equation tells us that the difference between the second monogamy deficit of @xmath0-partite system and its @xmath62-partite subsystem is equivalent to the difference between classical correlation and quantum discord . that is to say ,",
    "the difference between lami and limi can tell us that which system is more monogamous , the @xmath0-partite system or its @xmath62-partite subsystem .",
    "in other words , if we can extract more than half of the mutual information between @xmath68 and @xmath69 through local measurements on @xmath68 , the @xmath0-partite system must be more monogamous than its @xmath62-partite subsystem . as we all know , in studying entanglement of a tripartite system , the monogamy deficit of entanglement can be seen as a tripartite correlation which is called tangle , or genuine entanglement .",
    "similarly , for discord of an @xmath0-partite system , the monogamy deficit can also be seen as a type of multipartite correlation which beyond the usual bipartite correlations . in this sense",
    ", the @xmath0-partite system contains more multipartite correlation than its @xmath62-partite subsystem if and only if we can acquire at least half of the mutual information between @xmath68 and @xmath69 through local measurements on @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath70 , the above result goes back to formula ( [ monogam221 ] ) .",
    "now we can give a similar equivalent expression of @xmath71 . in order to achieve this purpose",
    ", we first define the average of classical correlation and discord .",
    "as we all know , the discord and classical correlation are asymmetry quantities . by using the asymmetry of @xmath54 and @xmath72",

    "according to the above definition , simply we have the relation , @xmath77 . which means that the monogamy inequality holds if and only if we can acquire at least half of the mutual information through local measurements in the average sense .    the eq .",
    "( [ monogam22121 ] ) presented above can also be used as a criterion to check whether a given tripartite pure state belongs to ghz class or w class state under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) . according to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have that a tripartite pure state belongs to ghz class state if and only if @xmath78 , otherwise it belongs to w class state .",
    "in other words , we can say that a tripartite pure state belongs to ghz class state if and only if the lami is always greater than or equal to the limi in the average sense when local measurements are performed on @xmath7 and @xmath13 . while a tripartite pure state belongs to w class state if and only if lami is less than limi in the average sense when local measurements are performed on @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , a tripartite pure state belongs to ghz class or w class depends on whether one can acquire no less than half of the mutual information through local measurements in the average sense .",
    "the above result tells us that there is a interesting relationship between the first monogamy deficit and the difference between the average of lami and limi for arbitrary tripartite pure states .",
    "in fact , we can generalize the relationship to arbitrary @xmath0-partite pure states .",

    "this equation provides that the difference between the monogamy deficit of @xmath0-partite system and its @xmath62-partite subsystem is equivalent to the difference between the average of classical correlations and quantum correlations .",
