    "a canonical example of such instability is the flapping of a flexible plate in an axial flow ( e.g. a flag ) , which has been extensively investigated for its rich and complex dynamics @xcite .",

    "this electric charge can be used in an output circuit connected to their electrodes , as in vibration control applications @xcite .",
    "piezoelectric materials also introduce a feedback coupling of the circuit onto the mechanical system : any voltage between the electrodes creates an additional structural stress that modifies its dynamics ( inverse piezoelectric effect ) .",
    "the concept of piezoelectric energy generator has received an increasing amount of interest in the last 20 years @xcite .",
    "its basic idea is to convert ambient vibration energy to useful electric energy through piezoelectric materials implemented on vibration sources .",
    "many researchers have contributed to this field in order to improve the efficiency of such energy - harvesting systems @xcite .",

    "flow energy harvesting can be achieved by exploiting the unsteady forcing of the vortex wake generated by an upstream bluff body to force the deformation of a piezoelectric membrane @xcite .",

    "these authors also stated that in the case of spontaneous flapping , it is necessary to account for the effect of lateral flow separation , which is empirically modeled by the following term @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the drag coefficient for a rectangular plate in transverse flow .",
    "it is important to mention that the flapping flag dynamics considered here implies a large reynolds number . a 10 cm long / wide flag in a wind flowing at around @xmath23 m / s leads to @xmath24 , while in water we would have @xmath25 for a flow velocity around @xmath26 m / s .",

    "the critical impact of the coupling coefficient @xmath57 on the system s performance is also underlined in the present work through its strong influence on the destabilization range and the lock - in range .",

    "<S> the spontaneous flapping of a flag in a steady flow can be used to power an output circuit using piezoelectric elements positioned at its surface . here , we study numerically the effect of inductive circuits on the dynamics of this fluid - solid - electric system and on its energy harvesting efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a destabilization of the system is identified leading to energy harvesting at lower flow velocities . </S>",
    "<S> also , a frequency lock - in between the flag and the circuit is shown to significantly enhance the system s harvesting efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest promising efficiency enhancements of such flow energy harvesters through the output circuit optimization . </S>"
