    "causality is the relation between causes and their effects , or between regularly correlated phenomena .",
    "causes are things that bring about results , actions or conditions . no doubt ,",
    "therefore , causality has been a major theme of concern for all branches of philosophy and science for centuries .",
    "perhaps the first philosophical statement about causality is due to the presocratic atomists leukippus and democritus : `` nothing happens without the influence of a cause ; everything occurs causally and by need '' .",
    "this intuitive view was a matter of continuous controversy , eventually cleverly criticized by hume , later followed by kant , on the grounds that probably our _ belief _ that an event follows from a cause may be simply a prejudice due to an association of ideas founded on a large number of experiences where similar things happened in the same _ order_. in summary , an incomplete induction .",
    "the task of science and particularly physics , however , is establishing or unveiling relations between phenomena , with a main goal : _ predictability _ of repetitions or new phenomena .",
    "nevertheless , when we state that , for instance , an increase on the pressure of a gas reduces its volume , we could equally state that a decrease of the volume increases the pressure .",
    "the ambiguity of the couple cause - effect is even greater when we reverse the sense of time . and",
    "this is one of the _ key _ points .",
    "the whole idea of causality must be founded upon the basic _ a priori _ that there is an orientation of time , a time - arrow .",
    "this defines the future ( and the past ) , at least on our neighbourhood and momentarily .",
    "consequently , all branches of physics , old and new , classical or modern , have a causality theory lying underneath .",
    "this is specially the case after the unification process initiated by maxwell with electromagnetism and partly culminated by einstein with the theories of relativity , where time and space are intimately inter - related .",
    "soon after , minkowski was able to unite these two concepts in one single entity : _ spacetime _ , a generalization of the classical three - dimensional euclidean space by adding an axis of time",
    ". a decisive difference with euclidean space arises , though : time has a different status , it mingles with space but keeping its identity .",
    "it has , so to speak , a `` different sign ''",
    ". this immediately leads to the most basic and fundamental causal object , the _ cone _ which embraces the time - axis , leaving all space axes outside . and",
    "upon this basic fact , by naming the two halves of the cone ( future and past ) , we may erect a whole theory of causality and causal structure for spacetimes .",
    "four - dimensional spacetimes ( see definition [ spacetime ] ) are the basic arena in general and special relativity and their avatars , and almost any other theory trying to incorporate the gravitational field or the finite speed of propagation of signals will have a ( possibly @xmath0-dimensional with @xmath1 ) spacetime at its base . the maximum speed of propagation is represented in this picture by the angle of the cone at each point . and",
    "this obviously determines the points that may affect , or be influenced by , other points . in physics , spacetimes represent the universe , or that part of it , we live in or want to model .",
    "thus , the notion of spacetime is pregnant with `` causal '' concepts , that is , with an inherent causality theory .",
    "causality theory has played a very important role in the development of general relativity .",
    "it is fundamental for all global formalisms , for the theory of radiation , asymptotics , initial value formulation , mathematical developments , singularity theorems , and many more .",
    "there are books dealing primarily with causality theory ( @xcite ) and many standard books about general relativity contain at least a chapter devoted to causality @xcite .",
    "recently , modern approaches to `` quantum gravity '' have borrowed concepts widely used in causality theory such as the causal boundary ( ads / cft correspondence @xcite ) or abstract causal spaces ( quantum causal sets @xcite ) .    roughly speaking the causal structure of a spacetime",
    "is determined at three stages : primarily , by the mentioned cones  called null cones , at each event .",
    "this is the _ algebraic _ level .",
    "secondly , by the the connectivity properties concerning nearby points , which is essentially determined by the null cone and the local differential structure through geodesic arcs .",
    "this is the _ local _ stage . and",
    "thirdly , by the connectivity at large , that is , between any possible pair of points , be they close or not .",
    "this connection must be achieved by sequences of locally causally related events , usually by causal curves representing the paths of physical small objects .",
    "this is the _ global _ level .",
    "these three stages taken together determine the causal structure of the spacetime . in short ,",
    "the causal structure involves the sort of relations , properties , and constructions arising between events , or defined on tensor objects , which depend essentially on the existence of the null cones , that is to say , on the existence of a _ sole _ time in front of all spatial dimensions .",
    "unfortunately , a precise definition of `` causal structure '' is in general lacking in the literature , as it is more or less taken for granted in the formalisms employed by each author .",
    "one of the aims of this review is to provide an appropriate , useful and rigorous definition of `` causal structure '' of sufficient generality .    from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "a spacetime is a",
    "_ lorentzian manifold _ : an @xmath0-dimensional semi - riemannian manifold @xmath2 where at each point @xmath3 the metric tensor @xmath4 , which gives a local notion of distances and time intervals , has lorentzian signature @xcite , the axis with the different sign ( @xmath5 ) indicating `` time '' ( cf . definition [ spacetime ] for more details ) .",
    "even though a great deal of research has been performed in four - dimensional lorentzian manifolds for obvious reasons , almost all the results do not depend on the manifold dimension and we will always work in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 . this",
    "is also adapted to more recent advances such as string theory , supergravity , et cetera .",
    "the field equations or physical conditions that the metric tensor @xmath6 must satisfy in order to lead to an acceptable representation of an actual spacetime are in principle outside the scope of this review .",
    "there is an entire branch of mathematics called lorentzian geometry whose subject is the study of lorentzian manifolds and it encompasses topics ( such as causality theory ) which traditionally have been studied by relativists . while the study of proper riemannian manifolds ( the metric tensor is positive definite at each point of the manifold",
    "so there is no time and no causality ) presents a status in which important questions such as the presence and study of singularities , geodesic connectivity , existence of minimizing geodesics , splittings , or the completion of the manifold are ruled by powerful theorems , the matter is radically different in lorentzian geometry where equivalent or analogous results require a case - by - case discussion with no general rule , and sometimes the answers to the `` same '' mathematical problems are entirely different .",
    "this makes of lorentzian geometry a more difficult topic where there are still open questions regarded as bearing the same degree of importance as those already solved in proper riemannian geometry .",
    "perhaps the main advantage of proper riemannian geometry in this regard is the existence of a well - defined notion of distance between points , a feature absent in lorentzian geometry where only a pseudo - distance can be defined @xcite . as a result",
    "many new possibilities arise in lorentzian geometry , see e.g. @xcite . among these new possibilities , as we will largely discuss in this review , those dealing with the _ causal structure _ and the _ causal completion _ of spacetimes are specially interesting mathematically and physically .    from both these perspectives , a _ generic causal structure _",
    "collects all information about lorentzian manifolds not related to the particular geometrical form , or causal characteristics , of any particular spacetime .",
    "that is to say , the properties which totally depend on the existence of any lorentzian metric @xmath6 on the manifold , and are absent if @xmath6 is removed .",
    "particular causal structure _ will then be a class of lorentzian manifolds carrying equivalent _ causal _ properties . since any good causal property must be _ conformally invariant _",
    "( because the null cones remain intact under conformal transformations ) many authors have assumed implicitly that the causal structure is fully determined by the conformal class of metrics : all metrics proportional to each other with a positive proportionality factor .",
    "however , recent studies ( see subsections [ causal - preservation ] , [ chains ] and @xcite ) indicate that this view may be too restrictive , and that non - conformally related metrics can belong to the same causality class in a well - defined way . of course , these more general causal classes , while not `` internally conformal '' , _ are _ conformally invariant !",
    "this opens a wide new world concerning causality which is still to be explored in detail .",
    "related to this is the question of the classification of `` exact solutions '' , i.e. particular spacetimes satisfying the field equations of a given theory and thus of physical interest , in terms of their causal structure .",
    "for instance , nowadays there is a large number of known exact solutions to einstein s field equations in four dimensions ( the standard reference is @xcite ) .",
    "some of them have been analyzed from a global point of view @xcite , but this study of global causal properties has not been performed in a majority of cases .",
    "though most of the theory of causal structures has been carried out in the framework of lorentzian manifolds , the definition of generic causal structures showed the possibility of a different line of thought by making an abstraction of the existence of the metric .",
    "this is possible because well - defined binary relations can be set between points of a lorentzian manifold according to their connectivity by causal curves .",
    "as these binary relations fulfill very precise properties , one can devise abstract sets , called _ causal spaces _",
    ", with no metric nor even differentiable structure but possessing binary relations whose properties resemble those present in spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these more abstract sets are also considered in this review and an account of the most popular _ causal spaces _ is given in section [ abstract ] .",
    "probably , most if not all of the results presented in this review for spacetimes extend in one way or another to abstract causal spaces .",
    "sometimes this has been made explicit in the review , but not always . as a matter of fact , for example , the new results of sections [ causal - preservation ] and [ chains ] can be extended to abstract causal spaces and in this sense the word `` causal structure '' also acquires a precise meaning for them .    the important issue of the _ correspondence _ between the mathematical model employed to describe the spacetime ( be it a lorentzian manifold or an abstract causal space ) and the real things that we see or the experimental measures we may perform has also been explored in the literature @xcite , and we give a brief account in subsection [ physics ] .    an important branch of causality theory with many ramifications is the theory concerning _ causal boundaries_. these are essentially sets of `` ideal points '' which , when added appropriately to a particular spacetime , make it _ complete _ in a definite sense .",
    "the idea is to attach a boundary to the spacetime under study keeping the causal properties and bringing infinity to finite values of judiciously chosen coordinate systems .",
    "also singularities are to be described as boundary points .",
    "causal completions stemmed from the lorentzian analog of the conformal compactification procedure which can be performed on proper riemannian manifolds . in the lorentzian case",
    "we can still carry out conformal compactifications , or other sensible completions , but the boundary points representing infinity can usually be classified into further subclasses @xcite , and there is no _ unequivocal _ procedure to achieve the causal completions .",
    "unfortunately , the conformal compactification is not always practical nor satisfactory , because either it is too difficult to achieve in _ simple _ cases , or one is interested in completing the spacetime without utilizing external elements , but employing only elements of the spacetime itself .",
    "this is precisely the idea behind the geroch , kronheimer and penrose construction , ( cf .",
    "subsection [ gekrpe ] ) , the most sophisticated and successful approach to causal boundaries historically .",
    "there is however no unique proposal to accomplish this and by now a wide range of techniques and procedures to construct a `` causal boundary '' for a spacetime are available , each with its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "this is an important line of research , with many relevant applications .",
    "just to mention a few : ( i ) the definition of asymptotically simple spacetimes and _ asymptotic flatness _ , see e.g. @xcite , has revealed a wealth of interesting properties of the conformal boundary permitting explicit computations of the gravitational power radiated to infinity and the construction of conserved quantities @xcite ; ( ii ) the study of the global characteristics , and global causal properties of spacetimes .",
    "for instance , it is very easy to distinguish globally hyperbolic spacetimes ( see definition [ ser ] ) from the rest by studying properties of the boundary ; and ( iii ) more recently , causal boundaries have received new interest due to the presence of the causal boundary concept in the maldacena conjecture @xcite .",
    "we review all new and classical matters concerning causal boundaries in section [ causal - boundary ] .",
    "having reached this point , it should be clear that studies related to the causal structure and the causal boundary in any of their varieties has been a high priority among relativists and differential geometers .",
    "one can also convince oneself by taking a glimpse at the long list of references  and the references therein ! why then a topical review on causal structures and causal boundaries ?",
    "the answer is , in our opinion , twofold : this seems to be a convenient time for an up - to - date revision and compilation of the ideas sketched in the previous paragraphs , pointing out those that are already old - fashioned or obsolete , and those with a promising future . and",
    "this should be complemented with a compilation of the new achievements , and the new possibilities opened in the field , which have been taking place in recent years .",
    "examples of these are the developments of ( realizations of ) semigroups and monoids @xcite , the potentialities of causal symmetries and causal preserving vector fields @xcite , new results about the splitting of lorentzian manifolds @xcite , new advances @xcite and renewed interest @xcite in the construction of causal boundaries , and others .",
    "it is also helpful to establish links between ideas presented in different places and under various motivations and a review like this could help achieve this goal . the review is intended to provide an introduction with enough basic information to make the article interesting and informative for non - specialist scientists .",
    "it can also serve as a reference source for those researchers interested in deepening their knowledge on any of the topics presented herein .",
    "moreover , we have really tried to bring to physicists attention some useful mathematical tools available in journals and books mainly addressed to mathematicians , and conversely , to inform mathematicians of many efforts and results which may be unknown to them .    in writing this review",
    "we were confronted with the decision as to what topics should be covered while keeping the length to a reasonable size .",
    "the guiding principle was to achieve a good compromise between historical relevance , impact on other research , applicability , and future perspectives of the reviewed results .",
    "perhaps one of the topics with a greater influence is penrose s idea of attaching a boundary to a given spacetime and this is why a major part of the review is devoted to the implications and generalizations of this fruitful idea .",
    "other relevant topics treated are the precise definition of causal structure , the axiomatic study of causality theory , and the classification of spacetimes according to their global causal properties as there are a number of recent investigations which have profited from these classic topics in causality .",
    "a full account of the matters covered together with the outline of the review is given in subsection [ plan ] .",
    "bearing in mind the above ideas , we set no time limits on the papers or books surveyed and only their compliance with the chosen topics was taken into account . in general",
    "we do not mean to be exhaustive in our exposition of each paper , rather , we give overviews in such a way that the reader may get a general idea and extract enough information to decide if the reference is worth looking at .",
    "thus , proofs of the results are in general omitted . nor are examples included in general ; although there are a few exceptions .",
    "the work of a large number of authors is described in the review . as is an unfortunate custom among us , scientists",
    ", each author often follows his / her own notation and conventions .",
    "hence it was a bit challenging to write a readable text while keeping faithful to the contents of the references .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we have maintained a consistent standard notation throughout , and we have adapted the original notation in the references to ours in order to provide a unified clear treatment of the subjects .",
    "in this review there are sections which may be instructive for young researchers , ph.d .",
    "students , and non - specialist scientists interested in the subject , as they contain introductions and enough basic information to make them informative for a general readership .",
    "other parts of the review give an account of recent results which due to their novelty might arouse the scientific curiosity of all interested readers .",
    "generally speaking , a non - specialist may be interested in reading sections [ sec : essentials ] , [ causal - characterization ] and , if willing to learn the basics about causal boundaries , also parts of section [ causal - boundary ] ( for instance subsections [ conformal - boundary ] , [ gekrpe ] and @xmath7[conformal - diagram ] . )",
    "a mathematically oriented researcher may be interested in the more abstract constructions of section [ abstract ] , in the theory of semigroups and monoids and the causal symmetries of section [ symmetry ] , or in the topological results of section [ sec : candt ] .",
    "a theoretical physicist would probably like to skip section [ abstract ] , but then he / she is advised to read subsection [ physics ] . on the other hand , sections [ sec : essentials ] ( except subsection [ causal - tensors ] ) , [ abstract ] and subsection [ hierarchy ] may be skipped by experts in the field , as we have tried to use a standard notation .",
    "if a reader wishes to pay attention only to the causal boundaries for spacetimes , then he / she can go directly to section [ causal - boundary ] and consult , if necessary , other parts of the review to which we refer there .",
    "finally , the review contains up - to - date information , recent advances and a handful of new applications which are not well known , not even to some experts .",
    "these new lines of research can be found in subsections [ causal - tensors ] , @xmath7[isocausal ] , [ chains ] , [ splitting ] , @xmath7[m - r ] , @xmath7[harris ] , @xmath7[causal - relationship ] , @xmath7[causal - diagram ] , @xmath7[ppwaves ] and the whole section [ symmetry ] .",
    "next , we give a brief outline of the contents of each section in order to help readers to choose according to their own interests .",
    "section [ sec : essentials ] is a basic summary of lorentzian causality in which all the standard concepts such as null cone , causal curve and basic sets used in the causal analysis are introduced , and we set the notation followed in the review . despite this being a basically standard section ,",
    "the relatively novel concept of future ( and past ) tensor , which is relevant for the entire theory of causality and permits to carry over the classical null cone structure to all tensor bundles is presented here in subsection [ causal - tensors ] .",
    "section [ abstract ] contains an account of four axiomatic approaches to sets possessing _ causal relations _ , trying to reproduce at least part of the basic causal building blocks present in a lorentzian manifold .",
    "these are the kronheimer - penrose causal spaces , carter s etiological spaces , the ehlers - pirani - schild axioms for a physical spacetime , later improved by woodhouse , and the _ causal set _ model for a quantum spacetime .",
    "the relationship between these approaches , their common features and differences are analyzed .",
    "apart from obvious historical reasons , we have decided to put section [ sec : essentials ] before section [ abstract ] because this is very instructive , and also because almost all the abstract concepts introduced in section [ abstract ] , which do not need any smooth underlying structure , were in fact inspired by the lorentzian geometry ideas .",
    "section [ causal - characterization ] accounts for different procedures to classify lorentzian manifolds and abstract causal / etiological spaces .",
    "the standard hierarchy of causality conditions is reviewed and briefly commented .",
    "an improved recent scheme to classify lorentzian manifolds based on setting causal mappings between them is reproduced here . in this framework ,",
    "the ultimate abstract definition of causal structure for a differentiable manifold is highlighted , and its implications investigated .",
    "a correct version of a much sought after but frequently misrepresented folk theorem , which was unproven until recently in its precise form , stating the local equivalence of all lorentzian manifolds from the causal point of view is given here .",
    "the definition and potentialities of causal chains of lorentzian structures on a given manifold are also recalled .",
    "the interplay between topology and causality is the subject of section [ sec : candt ] .",
    "classical topics such as possible topologies on spaces of causal curves or spaces of lorentzian metrics are explained here in a succinct manner .",
    "remarkable recent results on splittings of globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifolds are included in this section .",
    "section [ causal - boundary ] is the longest of the review and is devoted to an exhaustive account of the major attempts at finding `` the boundary '' of a lorentzian manifold .",
    "this section could very well deserve a full topical review on its own .",
    "the contents include all classical approaches explained in a concise form , but new important and promising advances have also been described , such as the intriguing new ideas by marolf and ross , the proof by harris of the universality of the classical future boundary using categories , or the new definition of causal boundary and causal completions using causal mappings . a basic introduction to the penrose diagrams with a comparison to their newly defined generalization called causal diagrams is also provided .    in section [ symmetry ]",
    "we discuss new concepts concerning the role of continuous transformations preserving the causal properties of spacetimes .",
    "this is a new line of research which incorporates some recent mathematical advances concerning realizations of semigroups and general cone structures .",
    "the transformations are studied from a finite viewpoint first ( causal symmetries ) and also from the infinitesimal perspective by defining their generators ( causally - preserving vector fields ) .",
    "the set of all such transformations is no longer a group , but a monoid which is in turn a subset of a more general algebraic structure known as semigroup .",
    "actions of semigroups on manifolds have been studied in mathematics and a brief account of this work is given in order to bring it to the knowledge of mathematical physicists .",
    "finally section [ future ] suggests new possible avenues of research , possible applications , and some interesting open problems which would be desirable to solve .",
    "an @xmath0-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath8 ( sometimes @xmath9 ) will be the basic arena in this review ( except in sections [ abstract ] and some other related places ) .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is endowed with a _ differentiable structure _ @xcite , that is to say , given any two local charts @xmath10 , @xmath11 of a given atlas @xmath12 with @xmath13 the induced diffeomorphism between the corresponding open sets of @xmath14 is of class @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 times differentiable with continuity ) .",
    "two atlases @xmath18 , @xmath19 are said to be @xmath15-compatible if @xmath20 provides another @xmath15 differentiable structure for @xmath8 .",
    "we will further assume that @xmath8 is hausdorff , oriented and connected .",
    "one can define at any point @xmath3 the tangent space @xmath21 , the cotangent space @xmath22 and by means of the tensor product `` @xmath23 '' of these vector spaces the space of @xmath24-contravariant @xmath25-covariant tensors @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "they give rise to the bundles @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "boldface letters will be used to denote elements of any of the mentioned spaces ( and also for the sections of the bundles ) , their distinction being usually obvious contextually .",
    "indices on @xmath8 are occasionally used and represented by lowercase latin letters .",
    "the push - forward and pull - back of a map @xmath30 are denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .    in this review",
    "we will be mostly concerned with a particular type of pseudo - riemannian ( also called semi - riemannian ) manifolds @xcite which are manifolds where a _",
    "metric tensor _",
    "@xmath6 is defined : @xmath6 is a non - degenerate symmetric ( at least ) @xmath33 section of the bundle @xmath34 , so that in local coordinates det(@xmath35)@xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the signature of @xmath6 is constant on @xmath8 . in any semi - riemannian manifold there is a canonical isomorphism between @xmath39 and @xmath40 which is induced by @xmath6 and thus indices on tensors can be `` raised and lowered '' adequately .",
    "when the signature of @xmath6 has a definite sign the manifold is called proper riemannian or simply riemannian .",
    "however , generic causal properties and the intuitive concepts of ` time flow ' , ` future and past ' , et cetera , can only be defined if the signature is lorentzian , so that one of the dimensions ( time ) has a different status with respect to the rest ( space ) .",
    "this allows for two possible ( equivalent ) choices , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , depending on whether a vector pointing on the time direction is chosen to have positive or negative length .",
    "such pseudo - riemannian manifolds are called _ lorentzian manifolds _ @xcite .",
    "our convention will be the first one , a choice determined by the particular goals we have in mind ( causal properties ) , so that any @xmath43 will be called timelike , null or spacelike if @xmath44 is respectively greater than , equal to or less than zero .",
    "non - spacelike vectors are commonly treated together and then also simply called _ causal _ vectors .",
    "an important point is that such a lorentzian metric @xmath6 can not be defined on manifolds with arbitrary topology ( this is a significative difference with the case of a proper riemannian metric which can be defined on every differentiable manifold ) .",
    "we will come back to this important point in section [ sec : candt ] .",
    "the set of all lorentzian metrics on a given differentiable manifold @xmath8 will be denoted by lor(@xmath8 ) .",
    "the interior , exterior , closure and boundary of a set @xmath45 are denoted by int@xmath45 , ext@xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , and the inclusion , union and intersection of sets are written as @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we will also need some basic terminology concerning binary relations in set theory .",
    "a binary relation @xmath51 on a set @xmath52 is a subset of the cartesian product @xmath53 . for any @xmath54 we will write @xmath55 .",
    "a relation @xmath56 is larger than @xmath51 if @xmath57 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath51 to a subset @xmath58 is the new relation @xmath59 denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "the inverse relation @xmath61 of @xmath51 is another binary relation defined as @xmath62 in particular , the relation is called symmetric if @xmath63 , while it is said antisymmetric if @xmath55 and @xmath64 imply necessarily that @xmath65 .",
    "other relevant cases are reflexive relations ( @xmath66 ) , anti - reflexive relations ( @xmath67 ) , and transitive relations ( @xmath55 , @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 ) .",
    "a relation which is reflexive and transitive is called a preorder , and antisymmetric preorders are called partial orders , while symmetric preorders are also called equivalence relations .",
    "a relation @xmath51 orders linearly the set @xmath71 if for any pair @xmath72 either @xmath64 or @xmath55",
    ". the reflexive relation @xmath51 will be called horismotic if for any finite sequence @xmath73 such that @xmath74 @xmath75 then    1 .",
    "@xmath76 @xmath69 @xmath77 , @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 @xmath69 @xmath81 , @xmath78 with @xmath82 .",
    "we start by reviewing the basic concepts and causal properties of lorentzian manifolds .",
    "as we will see in section [ abstract ] some of these key concepts can be generalized to sets which are not lorentzian manifolds ( in some cases they are not even differentiable manifolds ) , usually keeping the same notation and terminology .",
    "we will give brief definitions of most of the concepts involved in order to fix the nomenclature followed in this review .    a lorentzian manifold admitting a global nonvanishing timelike vector field @xmath83",
    "is said to be time orientable .",
    "such manifolds constitute the main underlying structure for most parts of physics through the following definition .",
    "any oriented , connected hausdorff @xmath84 lorentzian manifold with a time orientation and a @xmath33 metric @xmath6 is called a spacetime .",
    "the points of a spacetime are called events .",
    "[ spacetime ]    the conditions imposed in this definition may vary slightly in the literature ( compare for instance the definitions of @xcite ) .",
    "in particular time orientability is not always required , and the hausdorff requirement may be too restrictive in some situations ( see subsection [ classic ] for details ) .",
    "the question of when time orientability is feasible will be briefly discussed in subsection [ classic ] .",
    "the relation between orientability of the manifold , and space or / and time orientability is discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a consistent time orientation is crucial for the global causal structure and therefore we are forced to assume it here .",
    "moreover any non time - orientable lorentzian manifold has a double - cover which can be time oriented , hence we can always perform our study in this double covering .",
    "the condition of paracompactness is added in many references , but this is redundant because , as it was shown by spivak @xcite , a pseudo - riemannian manifold is necessarily paracompact .",
    "an important point concerning definition [ spacetime ] is that the @xmath33 condition for the metric tensor can not be improved to a larger @xmath15 with @xmath85 if one wishes to describe situations with different matter regions ( such as the interior and exterior of stars , or shock waves ) where these regions must be properly _",
    "matched_. the discontinuities of the matter content variables its energy density , for instance arise usually , via appropriate field equations ( e.g. einstein s field equations @xcite or any of their relatives ) , through discontinuities on the second derivatives of the metric tensor , which must thus be allowed .",
    "unfortunately , this poses enormous problems concerning causality structure , specially because the basic _ purely local _ causal properties of the spacetime , which are fundamental for the construction of the whole theory of causality , might not hold in general @xmath33 metrics .",
    "a longer description of this problem can be found in @xcite , and will be briefly considered later in subsections [ local ] , [ carter - study ] and [ classic ] . in order to avoid this annoying problem though despite it being completely fundamental! , we will implicitly assume for most of this review that @xmath6 is at least of class @xmath86 .",
    "in what remains of this section we follow the logical steps which allow us to build a sensible notion of causality : first we consider the direct _ algebraic _ implications that the existence of the lorentzian metric @xmath6 has at every single point @xmath3 ( subsection [ causal - tensors ] ) ; then we go a step further and construct the _ local _ causal structure of the spacetime , that is , at appropriate local neighbourhoods of any point ( subsection [ local ] ) ) ; finally , we explore the causal relations between non - locally related points ( subsection [ causal ] ) , which require the study of causal connectivity properties , that is , using causal curves , and leads to the definition of the fundamental sets used in causality theory .",
    "our first step towards the study of general properties of lorentzian manifolds concerns the classification that the lorentzian metric @xmath6 induces on the tangent bundle .",
    "as is obvious , the condition of time - orientability incorporated in definition [ spacetime ] implies that any _ causal _ vector @xmath43 can be classified as either future - directed or past - directed according to whether @xmath87 or @xmath88 ( recall that two causal vectors can be orthogonal with respect to @xmath6 only if they are null and proportional ; besides , without loss of generality we have implicitly assumed that the future is defined by the arrow of @xmath83 . ) this provides @xmath39 with a two - sheeted cone , the _ null cone _",
    ", which is the most basic causal object .",
    "future - directed timelike ( respectively null ) vectors lie inside the `` upper '' part of the null cone ( resp .  on the upper cone itself ) , and similarly the past - directed causal vectors on the lower part of the cone .",
    "surprisingly , the extension of this classification to higher rank tensors has only been formulated very recently in @xcite .",
    "probably , the main difficulty was that there is no simple relation between the length @xmath89 of a tensor @xmath90 and its `` causal character '' .",
    "nevertheless , one can use an equivalent definition of causal vector which can be translated to all tensors , namely , a vector @xmath91 is future directed if and only if @xmath92 for all future - directed vectors @xmath93 .",
    "hence , future tensors can be defined as follows @xcite .",
    "a tensor @xmath94 is said to be future ( respectively past ) if @xmath95 ( resp.@xmath96 ) for all future - directed vectors @xmath97 .",
    "a causal tensor is a tensor which is either future or past .",
    "[ caus - tensr ]    observe that @xmath98 is a future tensor if and only if @xmath99 is a past tensor .",
    "this definition extends straightforwardly to tensor fields and the bundles @xmath29 .",
    "it can be easily seen that the set of all causal tensors has an algebraic structure of a graded algebra of cones generalizing the null cone .",
    "several useful characterizations of causal tensors , as well as applications and their basic properties , were given in @xcite and subsequently improved and enlarged in @xcite .",
    "definition [ caus - tensr ] can be equivalently stated @xcite by ( i ) just demanding that @xmath100 for all future - directed _ null _ vectors @xmath101 or ( ii ) requiring that @xmath102 for all future - directed _ timelike _ vectors @xmath103 .",
    "simple criteria to ascertain when a given tensor is causal are given in @xcite .",
    "of course , the condition of future tensor was known long ago in general relativity for the case of symmetric rank-2 covariant tensors , but with another name and purpose : the future property is what was usually called the `` dominant energy condition '' for the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this was a condition to be demanded upon energy - momentum tensors likely to describe a physically acceptable matter content .",
    "thus , the property of a future tensor is sometimes referred to as the `` dominant property '' , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a more important property of causal tensors ( specially in the case of rank-2 tensors ) is their relation to maps that preserve the null cone .",
    "this was proved in @xcite and shows the deep connection of causal tensors with the elementary causal structure of the lorentzian manifold .",
    "this connection and the properties and applications derivable thereof were exploited in @xcite to generalize the notion of causal structure , and in @xcite to look for finite and infinitesimal transformations which preserve the causal structure , or part of it ; see also @xcite for a self - contained full exposition .",
    "we will come back to these novel matters later on in sections [ causal - characterization ] and [ symmetry ] , specially in subsections [ causal - preservation ] , [ chains ] , [ causal - symmetry ] and [ cpvf ] .",
    "the second step in the erection of the causal program is the extension to local neighbourhoods . to that end",
    "we need the classical ideas on local riemannian normal coordinates and normal neighbourhoods , and the definition of causal curves .",
    "recall that a piecewise @xmath15 curve with @xmath16 , @xmath104 , is a set of @xmath15 maps ( called arcs ) @xmath105 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a countable set of open intervals of the real line such that the set @xmath108 is a continuous curve in @xmath8 .",
    "a piecewise @xmath15 curve @xmath109 is said to be future - directed timelike ( resp .",
    "null , causal ) if its tangent vector at all points @xmath110 where it is well defined is a timelike ( resp .",
    "null , causal ) future - directed vector of @xmath21 , and furthermore the causal orientations of all the arcs @xmath111 are consistent .",
    "[ timelike - curve ]    note that the tangent vector to a piecewise @xmath15 curve is well defined at every point except possibly at the intersections @xmath112 , which are called corners . at these corners",
    "there may be two different tangent vectors , and the consistency condition included in definition [ timelike - curve ] requires simply that these two vectors point into the same causal orientation ( the future , say ) at every corner .",
    "obviously , causal curves can not change their time orientation within any of its arcs due to the differentiability of the @xmath113 , and thus a piecewise @xmath15 causal curve is future directed if all the `` pairs of tangent vectors '' at their corners are future pointing .",
    "for global causality one needs to consider limits of sequences of differentiable curves , which of course do not need to be piecewise differentiable curves themselves .",
    "this will be briefly considered in subsection [ causal ] .",
    "the _ exponential map _",
    "( see @xcite for details ) from an open neighbourhood @xmath114 of @xmath115 into a neighbourhood of @xmath3 maps a given @xmath116 into the point that reaches the geodesic starting at @xmath110 with tangent vector @xmath117 a unit of affine length away from @xmath110 provided this is defined .",
    "given that geodesics depend continuously on the initial conditions @xmath110 and @xmath118 , by choosing adequate neighbourhoods this exponential map is a homeomorphism , and actually a diffeomorphism if @xmath6 is @xmath86 .",
    "this exponential map allows to define the classical riemannian normal coordinates @xcite at a neighbourhood of @xmath110 .",
    "any such neighbourhood is called a _ normal neighbourhood _ of @xmath110 and they can be chosen to be convex @xcite . the change to normal coordinates must be at least of class @xmath33 to keep a differentiable atlas , and consequently the geodesics must depend differentially on the initial conditions . as mentioned before",
    ", this will _ not _ happen in physical situations requiring the matching of two different regions with different matter contents across a common boundary .",
    "it is well - known that under such circumstances there exists a local coordinate system , called admissible by lichnerowicz @xcite , in which the metric is @xmath33 piecewise @xmath86 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus , in these situations there is no guarantee that the normal coordinate neighbourhoods are differentiable at the matching hypersurface .",
    "this is _ crucial _ for causality and therefore to all theories and matters which rely on it ; see e.  g.  subsection 6.1 in @xcite for a detailed list of troubles arising in relation with singularity theorems due to this problem . in general , there are many statements concerning causality theory which have only been proven under the restrictive assumption of a @xmath86 metric , some notable exceptions can be consulted in @xcite .",
    "an example of these difficulties will be commented at the end of @xmath7[etio ] , and some results obtained in @xcite in subsection [ classic ] .",
    "having mentioned these fundamental difficulties  which are usually ignored or dismissed without mention , and in order to avoid complicated subtleties , we will consider , when needed , and for the rest of the review unless otherwise stated , that the metric is @xmath86 , keeping in mind that this problem should be eventually considered and solved .",
    "one of the most important results in causality theory concerns the local causal properties of spacetime and states that the causality within normal neighbourhoods of any @xmath3 is _ analogous _ to that of flat spacetime .",
    "the exact meaning here of the word `` analogous '' is very important : it has usually be interpreted as synonymous of `` equivalent '' . as we will largely discuss in subsection [ causal - preservation ]",
    ", this equivalence can actually be proven rigorously _ whenever an appropriate definition of causal equivalence _ is provided , and this proper definition _ can not _ be the usual and simple local conformal relation between spacetimes .",
    "this latter part was explicitly showed by kronheimer and penrose in @xcite , while the solution to the problem , selecting the right definition for causal equivalence , was only very recently given in @xcite .",
    "we postpone the discussion of these matters to section [ causal - characterization ] , and here we only want to give the basic facts supporting the `` analogy '' between the causality in local neighbourhoods and that of flat spacetime . to be precise ,",
    "let us define the future light cone ( resp .",
    "its interior ) of @xmath3 as the image of the future null cone ( resp .",
    "its interior ) in @xmath119 by the exponential map .",
    "observe that the light cone is only defined on a normal neighbourhood of @xmath110 .",
    "then , one can prove a fundamental proposition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the following is its strongest version we are aware of in terms of differentiability @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "any continuous piecewise @xmath33 future - directed causal curve starting at @xmath3 and entirely contained in a normal neighbourhood of @xmath110 lies completely on the future light cone of @xmath110 if and only if it is a null geodesic from @xmath110 , and is completely contained in the interior of the future light cone of @xmath110 after the point at which it fails to be a null geodesic .",
    "[ local - causal ]    observe that a non - differentiable curve composed by arcs of null geodesics is _ not _ a null geodesic .",
    "thus , any future - directed curve constituted by an arc of null geodesic from @xmath110 to @xmath120 followed by another null geodesic at the corner @xmath120 lies on the future light cone up to @xmath120 and enters into its interior from @xmath120 on .",
    "notice also that any future - directed causal curve which is not a null geodesic at @xmath110 immediately enters and remains in the interior of the light cone with vertex at @xmath110 , in particular all timelike curves from @xmath110 are completely contained in this interior .",
    "the third step towards the study of general causal properties of lorentzian manifolds is to show how this structure can be used to define certain global objects or properties on the manifold .",
    "we are specially interested in the possible relations arising between `` far apart '' points of the manifold because they can be generalized to more abstract sets other than differentiable lorentzian manifolds .",
    "the nice simple local causal structure shown in proposition [ local - causal ] does not hold globally in general , unless the spacetime is extremely well - behaved ( such as for instance in flat spacetime ) , as we will see .",
    "thus , all non - simple results concerning causality arise only as global aspects of the spacetimes , and one needs to investigate and try to control the properties of lorentzian manifolds globally .",
    "this is somehow frustrating , and paradoxical , if we have in mind physical theories such as general relativity , which are _ local _ in essence , as the differential equations determining the metric tensor field are obviously local . in such physical theories , in order to prove very important results , such as the singularity theorems , or the properties of horizons , black holes , and so on , the causality theory is absolutely necessary . but this is a _ global _ set of properties , while the theory , as already said , is only _",
    "local_. the traditional solution to solve this dichotomy has been the use of _ extensions _ , so that if a local solution was found one tries to extend it beyond its domain of validity as many times as needed until the resulting spacetime is inextensible @xcite .",
    "the problem with this strategy is that extensions are not unique , nor they can be determined by physical motivations or mathematical properties , see @xcite for a detailed discussion . in other words , extensions are arbitrary . and",
    "therefore , the global solutions needed to ascertain the causal properties of a spacetime rely on a very weak foundation .    nevertheless , if one assumes that the global lorentzian manifold is known , or given by any means , the causality analysis can be pursued without problems .",
    "this is an interesting task on its own , as we can learn the different possible causal structures compatible with spacetimes , and the possible difficulties , or surprises , that may arise .",
    "the basic objects permitting the global analysis are causal curves , as they connect points in @xmath8 which do not have to lie on the same normal neighbourhood .",
    "the simplest causal curves are the piecewise @xmath15 future- or past - directed timelike and causal curves introduced in definition [ timelike - curve ] .",
    "curves will usually be denoted in this review with the letter @xmath121 or @xmath122 if we want to make explicit the parametrization of the curve .",
    "the piecewise @xmath15 condition imposed in definition [ timelike - curve ] is needed in order to be able to define a tangent vector at the points of each arc @xmath111 of the curve .",
    "however , it is possible and indeed necessary to generalize the previous definition in order to include curves which are only continuous see @xcite .",
    "a continuous curve @xmath109 is said to be causal and future - directed if for every point @xmath123 there exists a convex normal neighbourhood @xmath124 of @xmath110 such that for every pair @xmath125 ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 with @xmath128 ) there is a @xmath33 future - directed causal arc contained in @xmath124 from @xmath120 to @xmath129 .",

    "this set is a topological space under the @xmath139 topology defined next .",
    "the collection of sets of curves @xmath140 where @xmath141 is an open set , constitute a basis for a topology in @xmath138 called the @xmath139 topology .",

    "other different notions of convergence on @xmath138 ( or more general sets of curves ) can be defined and studied although we will not pursue this matter further in this review ( see @xcite ) .      we are now prepared to define the fundamental binary relations between the points of a lorentzian manifold according to whether they can be joined by timelike , null or causal curves ( or none of them ) .",
    "let @xmath142 :    * @xmath143 is chronologically related with @xmath144 , written @xmath145 , if @xmath146 contains timelike curves ; * @xmath143 is causally related with @xmath144 , written @xmath147 , if @xmath146 is not empty ; * the relation @xmath148 means that @xmath147 but not @xmath149 .",

    "hence the boundary @xmath490 of @xmath52 is defined by @xmath491 .",
    "an important example of this is a proper riemannian manifold which as is well known can be transformed into a metric space with the standard notion of geodesic distance so the issue of attaching a boundary to a proper riemannian manifold can be addressed with no further complications .",
    "quite often , however , there are several inequivalent but sensible ways of attaching a boundary to a given set , be it because it has no metric - space structure , or because we want to make abstraction of this",
    ". this will certainly be the case for spacetimes , as they are not metric spaces , so that many boundaries are feasible ( with good properties ) and we will have to decide about which particular properties and objects we want to describe or study by means of the completion and the boundary . the driving idea in almost all of the boundaries conceived so far is to obtain completions which are causal sets or lorentzian manifolds but in such a way that the completion is _ consistent _ with the original causal structure .",
    "this means that causal relations between points of the completed manifold must agree with those of the original spacetime .",
    "the concept of such a  causal boundary \" for spacetimes was first introduced by penrose more than forty years ago and it turned out to be one of the most prolific ideas in general relativity as we hope to make plain in this section .",
    "in essence , penrose s idea is to embed the spacetime under study into another bigger lorentzian manifold _ conformally _ , so that the causal properties are trivially kept , and obtain properties of the initial spacetime by examining its boundary on the encompassing spacetime . after the initial success of this construction in simple but physically relevant examples ,",
    "the construction was generalized in several directions by a number of authors , sometimes keeping the idea of the embedding , sometimes not , but usually with the goal of trying to remove the use of conformal transformations , as they are almost impossible to find in generic situations .",
    "the most important generalizations are reviewed in this section . as a pre - conclusion",
    ", unfortunately we must say that in general either they are too theoretical , and cumbersome to be tested in explicit examples , or they present some undesirable features .",
    "however , there have been some recent advances and developments @xcite which might help in the final achievement of a definite and generally accepted definition of causal boundary .",
    "these are treated in subsections [ m - r ] , [ harris ] , [ aboundary ] and [ causal - relationship ] .",
    "penrose first introduced his idea of conformal boundary in @xcite and further developed it in @xcite .",
    "his aim when defining the conformal boundary was to study from another point of view questions related with the behaviour and radiative properties of spacetimes which are _ asymptotically flat_. in fact the very definition of asymptotic flatness can be formulated naturally in the framework of the conformal boundary .",
    "let @xmath492 be the metric tensor of a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime @xmath493 ( in purity , penrose had general relativity in mind and considered only the case @xmath494 , but we will leave the dimension of the spacetime free ) and suppose that we can set a conformal correspondence of this spacetime with a finite region @xmath9 of another @xmath0-dimensional lorentzian manifold with metric @xmath6 ( this is sometimes called the  unphysical spacetime \" ) .",
    "this means that at every point of such region we have the relation @xmath495 if @xmath9 was judiciously chosen ( say such that @xmath493 has compact closure in the unphysical spacetime ) then the whole of `` infinity '' in the physical spacetime can be brought to finite values of the coordinates of the unphysical spacetime .",
    "some other properties of the original spacetime which nevertheless are _ not _ part of it , such as its singularities , can also be read off from their guessed places on @xmath9 .",
    "thus ,  infinity \" and  singularities \" are typically parts of the boundary @xmath496 of @xmath497 in the unphysical spacetime , and thus we can extract properties of the physical spacetime , its global structure and its singularities , by just analyzing the properties of the boundary @xmath496 . the set @xmath496 is called the _ conformal boundary _ of @xmath497 . in some situations , such as asymptotically flat spacetimes , the part of the conformal boundary describing infinity of @xmath497 can be defined as the set of @xmath498 where @xmath499 ( and if one wishes to talk about  null infinity \" , see below , the condition @xmath500 is added ) .",
    "the part of the conformal boundary representing infinity is denoted by @xmath501 and called sometimes conformal infinity .",
    "therefore , in these cases a substantial part of the boundary are @xmath423-dimensional hypersurfaces of the unphysical spacetime @xmath502 .",
    "however , in general nothing can be said about @xmath501 in this sense , and it can be disconnected , or discrete , or @xmath503- , @xmath504-dimensional , et cetera , as well as a combination of hypersurfaces and all of these , and so on .",
    "the procedure just described is called the _ conformal compactification _ of @xmath497 relative to @xmath9 @xcite . it _ depends _ on @xmath9 and the chosen conformal factor ; even if the boundary is _ complete _ ( @xmath496 has compact closure on @xmath9 ) uniqueness is not ensured , though it is sometimes claimed that it is fixed exclusively by @xmath497 .",
    "the crucial point here , and for the whole construction , is that the physical spacetime is _ conformally related _ to its image on the enlarged manifold , and therefore the causal properties of @xmath497 have been kept .",
    "besides , the boundary acquires causal properties itself as a set of @xmath9 , so that it may be given attributes such as spacelike , timelike , or null , or it can have parts to the future / past of @xmath497 ( so that is to the future / past of the entire spacetime ! ) , et cetera .",
    "the conformal compactification can be carried out explicitly in the case of flat minkowski spacetime ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "a suitable choice for the unphysical spacetime is the einstein static universe .",
    "many other choices are possible , but this particular one has the virtue of making @xmath496 complete .",
    "to see this we write the flat minkowski metric in spherical coordinates @xmath505 where @xmath506 stands for the standard round metric on the sphere @xmath507 , and perform the coordinate transformation ( the angular part is simply omitted for shortness ) t=(()+ ( ) ) , + r=(()- ( ) ) , + with coordinate ranges @xmath508 , @xmath509 , @xmath510 .",
    "this transformation brings minkowski s line element into the form @xmath511 from which we see that it is conformal to a certain region of einstein static universe ( which has the line - element in brackets ) .",
    "this is depicted in the figure below taken from @xcite where the einstein static cylinder is shown ( @xmath512 spatial dimensions suppressed , so that each horizontal circle of the cylinder represents a @xmath513 sphere ) and in red the region conformal to minkowski spacetime .",
    "penrose suggested that a 4-dimensional spacetime @xmath514 is _ asymptotically flat _ if an unphysical spacetime @xmath502 exists such that the conformal infinity @xmath501 can be decomposed in two null three dimensional hypersurfaces @xmath515 and @xmath516 with the topological properties described in the figure above .",
    "as a matter of fact , it can be proven that , if the vacuum einstein equations hold on a neighbourhood of @xmath501 , then @xmath501 is a smooth null hypersurface with two connected components , among other results , see @xcite .",
    "later this definition was refined and the concepts of _ asymptotic simplicity _ and _ weakly asymptotic simplicity _ @xcite were introduced in the literature .",
    "it is worth remarking that these concepts only demand that conformal infinity be formed by null hypersurfaces but we know that in the minkowski case the set @xmath501 contains also discrete points .",
    "a complete correct definition of asymptotic flatness conveying the full structure of @xmath501 has been a difficult issue , specially in what refers to spacelike infinity @xmath517 .",
    "this was studied in full generality by ashtekar and hansen , and an alternative improved treatment has been recently performed by hayward , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the problems concerning @xmath517 will re - appear several times in what follows .",
    "it is also possible to study the gravitational radiation of asymptotically flat systems ( isolated bodies ) using these techniques .",
    "indeed , penrose was able to give explicit expressions for the gravitational power radiated `` at infinity '' by an isolated system as an integral over @xmath515 @xcite ( similarly there are expressions for the incoming radiation using @xmath516 ) , see for further details @xcite .",
    "these results were known previously from the work of bondi , trautman , pirani , sachs and others @xcite but the technique of the conformal boundary gave them a fuller , completely coordinate - independent , geometrical significance .",
    "the conformal compactification can be carried out for other spacetimes such as de sitter , anti - de sitter or some robertson - walker geometries @xcite .",
    "this showed that singularities ( such as the big bang ) may be part of the boundary , that the conformal boundary can have new unexpected properties ( an example of this is the non - differentiability of the metric at @xmath517 ) , and that one can give definite properties to @xmath496 as a region of the unphysical spacetime .",
    "in general , however , the full conformal compactification is very difficult to achieve , usually impossible .",
    "the good news is that , in certain particular but relevant cases , it is possible to perform the conformal compactification of a two - dimensional piece of the metric retaining the important information .",
    "this is what happens for instance in spherically symmetric spacetimes where the non - angular part of the metric ( 2 dimensions ) is conformally flat and thus liable to be conformally compactified . in this case",
    "we can draw two dimensional pictures , called _",
    "penrose diagrams _ @xcite , and define @xmath518 , @xmath519 for the conformal boundary so obtained if they exist .",
    "these extremely useful representations of spherically symmetric spacetimes will be further treated in section [ conformal - diagram ] .",
    "similarly , sometimes one can take a particularly relevant 2-dimensional surface ( ergo conformally flat ) of a given spacetime and draw its penrose diagram .",
    "this does not give a full insight into the properties of the spacetime , but it certainly enlightens our comprehension of some of its features .",
    "a paradigmatic example of this situation is given by the penrose diagram of kerr s spacetime , which is just the diagram of _ only _ its axis of symmetry , first found by carter @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the conformal compactification is almost a chimera in generic spacetimes , friedrich @xcite has been able to establish a procedure such that it is possible to write down a set of equations ( conformal equations ) in which @xmath520 and @xmath6 are part of the unknowns . in principle",
    "this could help to perform the conformal embedding of a spacetime , but even if not so , it allows to talk about ( and find some of ) the properties of the conformal boundary .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of spacelike infinity , which is one of the more intricate issues in conformal completions , can also be recast in a form were @xmath517 is given internal structure so that its properties become more transparent .",
    "for a review about all these matters , see @xcite . on this positive side",
    ", we should also mention some powerful recent interesting results @xcite , concerning the existence of conformal compactifications with a timelike @xmath501 ( such as in anti - de sitter spacetime , see @xmath7[conformal - diagram ] ) for a large class of globally hyperbolic static line elements .",
    "these spaces are shown to be geodesically complete einstein spaces ( with a negative scalar curvature ) , and no further symmetries apart from staticity .",
    "a very remarkable theorem found in @xcite ( for the case @xmath494 ) states that the manifold @xmath521 with _ any _ @xmath84 static lorentzian metric of non - negative scalar curvature _ is the conformal infinity _ of a 4-dimensional lorentzian einstein space based on @xmath522 with negative scalar curvature .",
    "penrose s idea of attaching a `` boundary '' to a spacetime was , and still is !",
    ", very attractive and it was pursued by several authors over the years with rather assorted techniques and aims .",
    "the question as to why one should be interested in enlarging or generalizing the conformal boundary construction to something else has many answers .",
    "first of all , one would like to avoid objects that are foreign to the spacetime under analysis , such as @xmath520 and the fictitious manifold @xmath9 .",
    "thus , a construction of the boundary using objects of the spacetime exclusively ( as is the case of the cauchy completions for metric spaces ) has been systematically sought . on the other hand",
    ", the conformal compactification is the simplest , and truly very appealing , way of attaching a boundary to a lorentzian manifold , so that sometimes the idea has been to look for ways to avoid the technical problems in finding the unphysical spacetime and the conformal factor  which may be very difficult to find in closed form .",
    "a third reason why the definition of a boundary can be useful is the analysis of singularities .",
    "singularities are not part of the spacetime since they are related with diverging quantities , or with incompleteness of curves , or with lack of tangent vectors .",
    "another way to look at this is by saying that a singularity is a set of points  where \" the spacetime itself ends , or blows up , so it is sensible to think that a singularity will lie `` at the boundary '' of the spacetime . and",
    "this is certainly the case in the simple examples constructed with penrose diagrams , and in general in all examples known so far .",
    "thus , a suitable definition of boundary should allow to tell apart which of its parts are singularities , and which are at infinity , among other possibilities , if they arise .",
    "if this were achieved , questions otherwise meaningless such as the shape of the singularity or its causal character would make perfect sense .    in the forthcoming subsections we review what we believe are the most relevant attempts in these directions presented so far in the literature giving accounts of the motivations lying behind each construction .",
    "one of the most famous attempts towards the construction of a causal boundary was performed by geroch , kronheimer and penrose in @xcite where they put forward a scheme to attach a `` boundary '' to any spacetime fulfilling certain causality restrictions .",
    "the method followed involved advanced topological constructions based only on global causal objects present in lorentzian manifolds .",
    "they tried to show that a causal boundary could be associated to certain spacetimes ( i ) without invoking  external \" concepts such as the unphysical spacetime or the conformal factor @xmath520 , and also ( ii ) by using only causal concepts with no attention to the existence of a lorentzian metric .",
    "only distinguishing spacetimes were covered by this method ( henceforth called gkp construction or _ c - boundary _ ) .",
    "instigating ideas for the gkp boundary were previously published by seifert in @xcite .",
    "he proposed a scheme to attach a causal boundary to space - times by basically assigning a future and past endpoint to any inextensible causal curve on a space - time @xmath8 .",
    "the set of such points would be the causal boundary @xmath523 .",
    "one can then introduce an ordering @xmath524 on the completed space - time @xmath525 which is an extension of the usual causal relation @xmath151 on the space - time @xmath8 .",
    "these ideas were much improved in @xcite .    before entering into the details of the gkp construction we need to define certain concepts dealing with future and past sets .",
    "recall that future and past sets ( definition [ futureset ] ) are those sets of the manifold @xmath9 whose chronological future ( past ) is contained in the set itself . here",
    "the authors restrict their attention to _ open _ future @xmath175 or past @xmath526 sets , which is equivalent to requiring @xmath527 and @xmath528 . such a future or past set is called indecomposable or irreducible ( if or ip resp . )",
    "if it is not empty and can not be written as the union of two proper subsets which are themselves future or past sets .",
    "roughly speaking indecomposable future and past sets can be divided into sets which are of the form @xmath155 for @xmath529 and those sets which can not be written as the chronological future or past of any point of the manifold .",
    "this distinction gives rise to proper indecomposable future and past sets ( abbreviated pif s and pip s ) and terminal indecomposable future and past sets ( tif s and tip s ) respectively .",
    "let us denote the collection of ip s by @xmath530 and the set of all if s by @xmath531 . for distinguishing spacetimes",
    "the manifold @xmath9 is the simplest example of tip and tif , but as we show next terminal indecomposable sets are easily characterised ( we only formulate the result for the past case ) @xcite .",
    "any ip is of the form @xmath532 where @xmath121 is a future - directed timelike curve .",
    "if @xmath121 has a future endpoint @xmath529 then the ip is the pip @xmath533 , while if @xmath121 is future endless then the ip is a tip .",
    "[ pip ]    therefore timelike future - endless curves give rise to tip s according to this theorem . as an example we can take minkowski spacetime . in this case it is known that tip s and tif s are respectively the chronological past and future of timelike curves with constant acceleration plus the whole manifold itself ( there are no other terminal indecomposable sets in minkowski spacetime ) , and these have endpoints at @xmath501 in the conformal boundary",
    "actually , one can set a clear correspondence between the tip s and tif s and the different regions of the conformal boundary described in section [ conformal - boundary ] : tip s and tif s represent @xmath515 and @xmath516 respectively and the tip or tif defined by the manifold itself represents @xmath519 .",
    "observe that @xmath517 is missing in this picture .",
    "as shown in @xcite , it is also possible to determine the set of ip s for asymptotically simple spacetimes getting a similar structure to that obtained by means of the conformal compactification .",
    "turning to the general case , theorem [ pip ] suggests that we may regard the tip @xmath532 as a sort of future _ ideal end point _ attached to the curve @xmath121 .",
    "the attribute ideal means that the point does not belong to the manifold @xmath9 but rather to a larger set containing @xmath9 as a proper subset .",
    "we should therefore try to construct a new manifold consisting of the points of @xmath9 plus the ideal points and call it the completion @xmath534 of @xmath9 .",
    "the set @xmath535 would then be the _ causal boundary _ and would contain ideal points only .",
    "how to construct this larger set , and to endow it with a topology , is the next task .",
    "clearly there is an obvious correspondence between pip s or pif s and the points of the manifold in a distinguishing spacetime .",
    "this correspondence is set by the injections @xmath536 , @xmath537 so the set of pif s is @xmath538 $ ] and the set of pip s is @xmath539 $ ] .",
    "neither @xmath251 nor @xmath407 are bijections , as the tip s and tif s are not included ( tip s and tif s are _ ideal points _ ) so the sets @xmath531 and @xmath530 are `` bigger '' than @xmath9 which means that they can provide us with the sought enlargement of @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , an obvious starting point to construct the enlarged manifold is the set @xmath540 .",
    "now we try to find a natural injection from @xmath9 into @xmath540 , but the problem is that each point @xmath529 naturally corresponds to two elements , @xmath184 and @xmath533 , of @xmath540 so it is not clear how we can map @xmath9 into @xmath540 in an injective way . to surmount this difficulty ,",
    "the proposal in @xcite was that a set of _ identifications _ must be carried out among the elements of @xmath540 .",
    "there are some identifications which are obvious ( for instance @xmath184 and @xmath533 must be identified ) but , unfortunately , sometimes identifications among the ideal points are also needed .",
    "a simple example of this happens when we try to construct the completion for spacetimes whose conformal boundary @xmath501 contains timelike regions . in this case",
    "any ideal point in one of such regions could stem from a tip as well and a tif , so they should be identified ( see figure ) .",
    "such that for each @xmath541 , @xmath542 the four sets @xmath543 , @xmath544 , @xmath545 , @xmath546 are open sets where a^=\\{p^*:p  pa } , + a^=\\{p^*:p  sm  p = i^-(s)i^+(s)a}. the sets @xmath545 and @xmath544 have similar definitions with the roles of past and future interchanged .",
    "the set @xmath547 becomes a topological space which in general is not hausdorff . to avoid this awkward feature ,",
    "an equivalence relation @xmath548 is defined on @xmath547 by the intersection of all the equivalence relations @xmath549 such that @xmath550 is hausdorff .",
    "this new hausdorff topological space is then taken as the desired enlarged manifold @xmath534 .",
    "if the spacetime @xmath9 is strongly causal , it was claimed in @xcite that the identifications performed when passing from @xmath547 to @xmath534 will never occur between elements of @xmath547 representing original points of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover there exists a natural , dense , topological embedding of @xmath9 into @xmath534 .",
    "stronger related statements will be presented later in proposition [ topology - consistency ] .",
    "the gkp @xmath551-boundary is very appealing for only simple causal properties are used in its definition and it recovers the structure found with conformal techniques in relevant cases , such as asymptotically simple spacetimes .",
    "a general procedure for constructing the @xmath551-boundary of static spacetimes can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , a number of issues are left open in this construction aside from the construction of the rule @xmath548 already commented .",
    "first of all the different regions of the causal boundary were not studied for general cases ( only spacetimes asymptotically simple are treated ) and second the construction of causal relations between points at the boundary was not investigated in @xcite .",
    "these features were the subject of subsequent papers published by other authors who took the gkp scheme as their starting point .",
    "some of these are reviewed next .      in this section",
    "we review the different attempts carried out to fill in the unfinished steps of the gkp construction .",
    "we must say right from the start that each intended improvement was sooner or later found to bear undesirable features rendering all of them , as well as the original gkp , unsuitable to be regarded as boundaries for spacetimes in _ general _ situations .",
    "only the main ideas of each construction are given as the details and examples usually result in rather technical statements .",
    "the paper by budic and sachs @xcite develops the gkp construction for causally continuous spacetimes . in this case",
    "the authors are able to extend the causal structure and the topology of the spacetime @xmath9 to the enlarged spacetime @xmath534 by means of the definition of a suitable relation @xmath548 . before explaining how this relation is constructed the following definition is needed @xcite .    for any set",

    "a very important result proved in @xcite is that @xmath562 is a hull pair for any @xmath529 if @xmath9 is causally continuous ( this is too strong a restriction ; it is known that @xmath562 is a hull pair if and only if @xmath9 is just reflecting @xcite ) .",
    "if we recall that the sets @xmath184 and @xmath533 must be identified in the gkp construction , and given that this identification takes place naturally in causally continuous spacetimes through the relations @xmath563 and @xmath564 , it seems appropriate to introduce a binary relation on @xmath565 defined by the elements @xmath559 which form a hull pair .",

    "it is also possible to define a topology @xmath572 on @xmath571 ( also called extended alexandrov topology ) as follows : a set @xmath573 is called an enlargement of @xmath9 if it contains either @xmath252 or @xmath253 for all @xmath498 .",

    "after this account of the attempts based on the geroch , kronheimer and penrose paper it may be a little bit disappointing to learn that the majority of the gkp - based schemes present unsatisfactory features  see , however , subsection [ harris ] . here",
    "we will limit ourselves to give brief comments about the unconvincing aspects referring the interested reader to the literature for the precise details .",
    "let us remark that the main driving force behind the successive gkp - modifications was in fact to give an answer to the successive drawbacks found in certain well - devised examples .    to start with , penrose @xcite classified the points of the @xmath551-boundary as _ infinity _ points and _ finite _ points . in the first case the @xmath659-tip or @xmath659-tif representing",
    "the point is a set of the form @xmath532 or @xmath660 , respectively , where @xmath121 is a complete future ( past ) inextensible causal curve .",
    "the case of finite ideal points has the same definitions but now the curve @xmath121 is incomplete .",
    "unfortunately , this classification does not provide a boundary with the `` right shape '' in some examples , as we show next .",
    "the paradigmatic counterexample is the gkp boundary of taub s plane - symmetric static vacuum spacetime , whose line - element is @xmath661 in @xcite the @xmath551-boundary of this spacetime is explicitly constructed and it is shown that its singular part in the sense of penrose consists of a single point .",
    "however , the penrose diagram of the appropriate 2-dimensional subregion spanned by the coordinates @xmath662 ( see subsection [ conformal - diagram ] ) shows that the singularity @xmath663 should be a one - dimensional set .",
    "other counterexamples with analogous behaviours are also presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , a first type of bad behaviour is that the `` shape '' of the boundary is not the expected one in certain examples .",
    "the modifications of the @xmath551-boundary explained in subsections [ rac ] , [ sza ] and [ m - r ] correct this problem for the taub spacetime , though .",
    "unfortunately , there are other type of problems in the gkp - based constructions dealing with the topology of the completed spacetime .",
    "these problems were illuminatingly pointed out in @xcite where they became apparent through carefully conceived examples in which the @xmath551-boundaries are explicitly constructed .",
    "the failure shown in all examples is similar in nature : the topology of the causal boundary @xmath664 using rcz or szabados versions for the @xmath551-boundary does not match the natural topology of the completed spacetime @xmath534 .",
    "for instance , many examples are just two- or three - dimensional minkowski spacetime with certain regions removed .",
    "the causal completion of the excised spacetime is then performed and it is proven that the topology obtained according to each of the @xmath551-boundary prescriptions under surveillance is different from the topology of the closure in minkowski spacetime of the excised region . this is shown typically using sequences whose limit differ on each topology .",
    "the authors conclude in @xcite that the attempt to describe the singularity structure via the completion of the spacetime and the definition of a causal boundary may be inappropriate . as a matter of fact",
    ", all attempts have encountered undesirable properties so far in certain simple cases , so that one wonders what could happen in more complicated cases where there is no obvious `` right '' answer to be obtained or compared to .    for further problems",
    "see @xcite . on the other hand , for a positive albeit moderate result regarding the _ future _ @xmath551-boundary ,",
    "see next subsection .",
    "harris adopted a different approach to the subject in the companion papers @xcite .",
    "apparently , his goal was to show that the gkp boundary may be regarded as natural in a categorical sense under some well - established restrictions .",
    "thus , instead of seeking yet another construction for the @xmath551-boundary , the universality of the gkp boundary construction was settled `` in a categorical manner '' .",
    "as part of the problem resides in that completions of a spacetime may fail to be a manifold , in @xcite only  chronological sets \" , which are similar to the causal spaces of definition [ causal - space ] but just having the chronology relation @xmath150 , are considered .",
    "given a chronological set @xmath52 , the gkp procedure of attaching a _ future _ causal boundary to a space - time is carried over to @xmath52 , provided certain conditions are met .",
    "a crucial point here is that only the _ future _ completion is defined .",
    "this is a clever choice , because many of the problems arising with the gkp construction have their roots in the intricate problems inherent to the identification of ideal points in the past boundary @xmath602 with ideal points in the future boundary @xmath601 . independently of this",
    ", one can further show that the topology generated for the minkowski spacetime does not coincide with that of its conformal completion of section [ conformal - boundary ] , see @xcite .",
    "the future - completed chronological set is denoted by @xmath665 and the future chronological boundary by @xmath666 .",
    "there are examples with @xmath667 , called future - complete chronological sets .",
    "a map @xmath668 between two chronological sets @xmath52 , @xmath71 is called _ future - continuous _ if @xmath296 is chronal preserving in the sense of definition [ theta ] and if the image @xmath669 of the limit of a future chain on @xmath52 is the future limit of the ( necessarily future ) image chain on @xmath71 .",
    "important properties are : ( i ) for any future continuous @xmath296 there exists an extension @xmath670 ; ( ii ) the natural inclusion @xmath671 fulfills the property @xmath672 . using this , the universality principle is proved : if @xmath71 is future - complete , for any future - continuous map @xmath668 @xmath673 is the unique future - continuous extension of @xmath296 to @xmath665 such that @xmath674 .",
    "this result is very important because it says that any future completion of @xmath52 can be compared with its gkp version preserving the chronology of @xmath52 , that is to say , the gkp construction is universal ( in the appropriate category , @xcite states all results in the language of categories and functors ) . as remarked before , harris also points out that the total @xmath551-boundary , both future and past with appropriate points identified , does not seem to have an analogous universality property .",
    "a very readable account of this line of research with examples and a summary of the relevant results can be consulted in @xcite , by the same author .",
    "recently , there has appeared a new paper where the relation between the gkp boundary of a quotient spacetime by a set of isometries and the induced quotient of the gkp boundary is analyzed @xcite from this point of view .      in this section",
    "we summarise other attempts to attach a `` ( causal ) boundary '' to any spacetime .",
    "as happens with the case of the @xmath551-boundary , some of these constructions were found to be unsatisfactory in certain examples .",
    "we start with the cases were no external objects but only the intrinsic structure of the spacetime are needed ( subsections [ gboundary][meyer ] ) , and then we consider new approaches where the idea of  enlargement \" or  embedding \" into larger manifolds has been reformulated and improved ( subsections [ aboundary ] and [ causal - relationship ] ) .",
    "the @xmath675-boundary was devised by geroch in @xcite and was probably one of the first attempts to attach a boundary to lorentzian manifolds .",
    "the main idea behind the construction was to try and deal with singularities ( understood as inextensible incomplete geodesics ) , and to provide them with causal and metric properties . at the time",
    "@xcite was published , there was no generally accepted definition of singularity in general relativity although , generally speaking , geodesic incompleteness was already agreed to indicate the presence of singularities ( be them removable or essential singularities , see @xmath7[aboundary ] ) . a ( essential )",
    "singularity should never be considered as part of the spacetime and so it should be placed `` at its boundary '' . thus , geroch tried to attach a boundary to each incomplete inextensible causal geodesic .",
    "the @xmath675-boundary is outdated nowadays , since the definition of singularities requires not only caring about geodesic incompleteness , but about that of other causal curves as well .",
    "this was actually remarked by geroch himself in a very interesting paper @xcite where an explicit future - incomplete inextensible timelike curve with bounded acceleration was explicitly exhibited in an otherwise geodesically complete spacetime .",
    "however , we have considered interesting to include a summary of the @xmath675-boundary here due to its historical interest and for the sake of completeness .    the @xmath675-boundary is formed by equivalence classes of incomplete inextensible geodesics under a certain equivalence relation .",
    "essentially the whole idea is to collect in classes geodesics which stay close to each other .",
    "let @xmath388 be an @xmath0-dimensional spacetime and denote by @xmath676 the tangent bundle @xmath677 .",
    "as is well known @xmath677 is a differentiable manifold of dimension @xmath678 .",
    "furthermore each point @xmath679 , @xmath529 , @xmath680 determines one and only one geodesic @xmath121 and conversely so we can speak of the points of @xmath676 as the geodesics on @xmath9 .",
    "next one defines the @xmath681-dimensional manifold @xmath682 and the subsets h_+=\\{(p,,a)h:(p,)>a } ,  h_0=\\{(p,,a)h:(p,)=a } , + g_i=\\{(p,)g:(p , ) < } , where @xmath683 is the affine length of the geodesic @xmath684 , which is infinity if the geodesic is complete .",
    "we need also the mapping @xmath685 defined by the rule @xmath686 the point @xmath687 resulting after travelling an affine distance @xmath137 along the geodesic @xmath684 .",
    "the next step is topologizing @xmath688 as follows : for any open set @xmath689 we define the set @xmath690 as the subset of @xmath688 such that @xmath691 in plain words @xmath690 consists of the incomplete geodesics entering @xmath692 and never leaving it .",
    "the collection of sets @xmath690 with @xmath692 ranging over all open sets of @xmath9 serves as a basis for a topology on @xmath688 called the open set topology .",
    "we are now ready to define the equivalence relation on @xmath688 leading to the @xmath675-boundary .",
    "any two elements @xmath693 , @xmath694 are related ( written @xmath695 ) if every open set in @xmath688 containing @xmath693 also contains @xmath436 and vice - versa are also considered in @xcite but `` @xmath696 '' is the weakest in the sense that points of @xmath688 are identified if they can not be distinguished topologically . ] . the relation `` @xmath696 '' is an equivalence relation on @xmath688 and the set of equivalence classes , denoted by @xmath697 , form the @xmath675-boundary of @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore the topology of @xmath688 induces a topology on the quotient set @xmath697 in the standard way .",
    "the completed space - time @xmath534 is then the union of @xmath9 plus the singular points @xmath697 , and can be endowed with a topology whose basis is formed by pairs of open sets @xmath698 with the added property that @xmath699 .",
    "the restriction of this topology to @xmath9 and @xmath697 is consistent with the topologies previously introduced .",
    "an interesting feature of the @xmath675-boundary is the possibility of regarding @xmath697 as if it were a hypersurface , so that concepts such as spacelike or timelike @xmath697 can be defined .",
    "thus , @xmath697 is spacelike at @xmath700 if there exists a neighbourhood @xmath701 such that for every @xmath702 there is another neighbourhood @xmath703 of @xmath704 with the property @xmath705\\cap(o',u')=\\varnothing$ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath697 is timelike at @xmath706 if for every neighbourhood @xmath707 of @xmath706 in @xmath534 we can find two points @xmath708 such that @xmath709 contains an open neighbourhood of @xmath706 in @xmath534 . here , @xmath585 are the natural extensions of @xmath396 to @xmath534 .",
    "some applications of this construction discussed in @xcite deal with the study of space - time extensions and the relationship between the @xmath675-boundary and the conformal boundary of penrose .",
    "an important limitation of the @xmath675-boundary is that by construction @xmath697 only includes singularities and not points `` at infinity '' .",
    "furthermore , as remarked above , only _ some _ singularities are included in @xmath697 . these and other unsatisfactory features of the @xmath675-boundary were considered in @xcite for certain examples .",
    "the @xmath137-boundary construction invented by schmidt @xcite was also motivated by the problem of singularity definition in general relativity . at the time schmidt s paper was published , relativists were already aware that not only inextensible incomplete geodesics were to be taken into account when constructing the boundary of singular points , rather all causal ( and even non - causal ) inextensible curves had to be considered , @xcite .",
    "to deal with this problem , schmidt worked with the bundle of frames @xmath710 constructed from the spacetime @xmath9 and it is actually in this manifold where the completion is carried out obtaining the set @xmath711 and its boundary @xmath712 . from this",
    "the @xmath137-boundary of the manifold is defined as @xmath713 where @xmath714 is one of the connected components in which @xmath710 splits for any orientable manifold and @xmath715 is a suitable extension of the projection of the frame bundle onto its base space . in order to achieve the completion of the frame bundle @xmath710 the author defines a proper riemannian metric on this manifold and perform its standard cauchy completion .",
    "let us summarize next how the riemannian metric is constructed on @xmath710 ( the reader is assumed familiar with fibre bundle theory ) .",
    "a frame bundle is a particular case of a _ principal bundle _",
    "so one can use in this case standard concepts which are specific for them .",
    "as is well known , a connection on a principal bundle defines a subspace in the tangent space of any point @xmath716 ( horizontal subspace ) which is complementary to the vertical space .",
    "the _ standard horizontal vector fields _",
    "@xmath717 are the only horizontal vector fields fulfilling the property @xmath718 where @xmath719 is a frame of @xmath710 .",
    "introduce also a set of 1-forms @xmath720 dual to the family @xmath721 @xmath722 the connection can be characterized by means of a 1-form @xmath723 with values in @xmath724 , the lie algebra of the structural group @xmath725 . in this sense",
    "horizontal vector fields are characterized by the condition @xmath726 the 1-form @xmath723 can be written in components with respect to a basis of the lie algebra @xmath724 , @xmath727 , as @xmath728 where the coefficients @xmath729 are 1-forms on @xmath710 called the connection forms .",
    "a proper riemannian metric @xmath730 on @xmath710 is given by @xmath731 for any pair of vector fields @xmath52 , @xmath71 on @xmath710 .",
    "this is called the _",
    "bundle metric_. notice that once we get the completion of the frame bundle the projection @xmath715 must be extended as well from @xmath710 to @xmath711 ( we still use the same symbol @xmath715 for this extended projection ) .",
    "this is done through the extension of the right action of the structural group @xmath725 on the frame bundle .    at first glance",
    "this construction may seem rather abstract with no definite relation with the points of a boundary for @xmath9 . to start digging the intimate relationship with incompleteness on @xmath9",
    ", we must realize that points of the @xmath137-boundary are equivalence classes of cauchy sequences in @xmath710 with respect to the distance defined by the metric @xmath730 , so it would be interesting to have an interpretation for the length of curves in @xmath710 with respect to the bundle metric . for curves @xmath732",
    "such that their tangent vector @xmath733 is horizontal ( horizontal curves ) this length takes the form l=_0",
    "^ 1(_i=1^n^i()^i())^1/2dt .",
    "[ b - length ] as @xmath732 is horizontal , the frame @xmath734 determined by @xmath732 is parallel propagated along the curve @xmath735 whose tangent vector is @xmath736 from this we conclude that @xmath737 is nothing but the `` euclidean length '' of the curve @xmath738 measured with respect to a parallel propagated frame . in particular , the previous reasoning applies to any geodesic because the lift of any geodesic is a horizontal curve . from this",
    "it is not difficult to conclude the following important result    if the bundle metric is complete , then the connection is geodesically complete .",
    "[ complete ]    therefore geodesically incomplete connections entail incomplete bundle metrics or in other words any incomplete geodesic on @xmath9 determines a point of the @xmath137-boundary .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath137-boundary is that the converse of theorem [ complete ] is not true , and in fact incomplete curves which are not geodesics also determine points of the @xmath137-boundary",
    ".    equation [ b - length ] can be seen as an appropriate notion of length valid for any @xmath33 curve of @xmath9 ( any @xmath33 curve admits an horizontal lift ) .",
    "this new length has some indeterminacies , but if it is finite for a given choice of frame , then it _ is _ finite for any other choice .",
    "so , one can speak of _ @xmath137-completeness _ of curves without ambiguity , and without resorting to frame bundle theory in fact . in this sense",

    "as happened in other cases , this is the tricky point and in fact there are examples in the literature where the @xmath137-boundary is constructed explicitly and shown to have strange topological properties @xcite .",
    "an interesting alternative to schmidt s construction was proposed by sachs in @xcite where he used the tangent bundle of the manifold instead of the principal bundle of orthonormal frames .      in the interesting paper @xcite",

    "finally the distance between two points is simply @xmath747 the pair @xmath748 is then a metric space but the distance @xmath749 need not be finite for all the pairs @xmath750 .",
    "to get rid of this and other awkward features , only spacetimes of finite timelike diameter @xcite are considered .",
    "this is the main disadvantage of meyer s construction , as it leaves out many simple obvious spacetimes . under the mentioned assumption",

    "furthermore the topology induced by this distance agrees with the manifold topology , and the continuity of @xmath751 implies causal continuity of @xmath388 .",
    "the metric space @xmath748 can now be completed to @xmath753 by means of the cauchy completion and one gets the boundary as @xmath535 .",
    "the causal structure can then be extended to the completion @xmath534 .",
    "the relation between this boundary and the @xmath551-boundary is analyzed , and the new boundary is explicitly constructed for some examples , in @xcite .",
    "the _ abstract boundary _ or @xmath136-boundary , first introduced by scott and szekeres in @xcite , was also devised with the study of singularities in mind .",
    "however , while the @xmath675- and @xmath137-boundaries did only use objects intrinsic to the lorentzian manifold to be completed , the @xmath136-boundary comes back to the original idea on which the conformal compactification and conformal boundary were founded : embeddings into larger sets .",

    "one of us @xcite put forward a definition of singularity based on the above by understanding the inextensibility of b.p.p curves as @xmath137-completeness . thus a concept of singular extension",

    "envelopments _ , it is too general to provide definite properties such as shape , causal structure , topology , metric , et cetera of the boundary . it can be used , however , as an appropriate starting point for any try , and as a background for other more definite constructions , see next subsection .",
    "after this journey through all the attempts to construct a valid causal boundary for generic spacetimes , one often reaches the state in which , on intuitive grounds , one prefers the original plain and elementary definition of the penrose conformal compactification .",
    "it is clear , simple , productive and provides all the required properties : shape , causal structure , metric , causal character , probably distinction between infinity and singularities , and so on and so forth .",
    "the only problem was , in fact , the actual impossibility of finding the conformal embedding explicitly in general recall , however , the powerful encouraging results found in @xcite .",
    "this is why we tried to improve the conformal compactification in @xcite , where a new definition of causal boundary was presented .",
    "the idea is very simple : now that we have come to know that an appropriate definition of isocausal lorentzian manifolds ( definition [ equivalence ] ) is more general than the conformal one , and that the causal structure can be defined as in definition [ causal - structure ] , we can simply repeat the whole conformal - boundary construction by replacing any  conformal \" mappings by the causal mappings of definition [ prec ] .",
    "this simple generalization provides us with the notions of _ causal extensions , causal boundaries _ and _ causal compactification _ in an obvious way .",
    "this program has many advantages : on the one hand , it keeps all the good properties of the conformal scheme , which is in fact contained as a particular case .",
    "thus , one can give attributes such as shape , causal character , dimensionality , connectivity , topology , et cetera , to the boundaries , and furthermore the traditional penrose diagrams can be generalized to get intuitive pictures of complicated spacetimes , see @xmath7[causal - diagram ] and @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it avoids to a certain extent the only problem with the compactification process , which was looking for the conformal factor and embedding .",
    "now we only have to look for two mutual causal mappings , which are certainly easier to find as the restriction to be a causal mapping is much milder ( see the discussion after definition [ prec ] ) than that of being a conformal one .    to be precise , let us start with the following definition",
    ". recall the equivalence relation `` @xmath384 '' of definition [ equivalence ] .",
    "a causal extension of a lorentzian manifold @xmath2 is any envelopment @xmath786 into another lorentzian manifold @xmath787 such that @xmath8 is isocausal to @xmath788 : @xmath789 .",
    "[ causal - extension ]    observe that a causal extension for @xmath2 is in fact a causal extension for the causal structure , that is to say , for the whole equivalence class coset@xmath790 @xmath313/@xmath384 based on @xmath8 of which @xmath2 is a representative , see definition [ causal - structure ] .",
    "notice that the causal extension is different from the traditional metric extensions ( definition [ cl - extension ] ) in which the _ metric _ properties of @xmath2 are kept , and also from the conformal embeddings of subsection [ conformal - boundary ] , where the conformal metric properties were maintained .",
    "here we only wish to keep the causal structure of @xmath8 , in the sense of definition [ causal - structure ] , which is a much more general point of view .",
    "we would like to remark , however , that obviously all metric extensions and all conformal embeddings are a particular type of causal extension , hence they are trivially included in definition [ causal - extension ] : any conformal embedding is a causal extension with the particular choice that the causal equivalence between @xmath8 and @xmath788 is of conformal type .",
    "we arrive at the main definition .",
    "let @xmath786 be a causal extension of @xmath2 and @xmath523 the topological boundary of @xmath788 in @xmath791 .",
    "then , @xmath523 is called the causal boundary of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath787 .",
    "a causal boundary is said to be complete if @xmath788 has compact closure in @xmath792 .",
    "[ causalbound ]    note again that all the members in coset@xmath793 have the same causal boundary _ with respect to a given causal extension_. in principle , however , the causal boundaries of coset@xmath793 may depend on its causal extensions . at this stage",
    ", this is a problem more serious here than for conformal completions , as in the latter case it seems reasonable to conjecture that the main properties of a causal boundary will be unique _ if _ the boundary is _ complete _ @xcite , and this is not the case for the former case , see the long discussion in examples 12 and 13 in @xcite .",
    "we have persuaded ourselves , though , that this problem can be easily overcome by adding the necessary restrictions to definition [ causalbound ] .",
    "this is one of the open questions about definition [ causalbound ] .    with regard to how to distinguish between points at infinity or singularities at a causal boundary one",
    "can use the ideas of th @xmath136-boundary in an effective way .",
    "thus , in @xcite we gave the following primary classification    let @xmath523 be the causal boundary of @xmath2 with respect to the causal extension @xmath786 .",
    "a point @xmath794 is said to belong to :    1 .   a _ singularity set _",

    "future infinity _",

    ". we can also collect all past and future infinities in a set called _ causal infinity_. hitherto , it has not been proved that all points in a causal boundary belong to one of the possibilities of the previous definition , nor that the different possibilities are disjoint in general .",
    "these are interesting open questions .",
    "to summarize , our scheme provides in principle a simple way to attach a causal boundary to any lorentzian manifold .",
    "its practical application in specific cases still suffers from the problem of finding the causal extensions @xmath786 for generic lorentzian manifolds @xmath2 , but this is certainly easier than finding the conformal completions . besides , it is our opinion that a systematic way to find out whether or not two lorentzian manifolds are isocausal does exist , and so this problem could be fully resolved .",
    "we thus believe that it is worth exploring this new line and try to answer the open questions mentioned in this subsection .    for some examples of causal diagrams constructed using causal extensions",
    "see @xmath7[causal - diagram ] and @xcite .",
    "we now briefly present some remarks and comments about the traditional penrose diagrams ( @xmath7[conformal - diagram ] ) , its comparison to the new causal diagrams ( @xmath7[causal - diagram ] ) , and some recent interesting applications and results which have been found in lorentzian manifolds of pp - wave type ( @xmath7[ppwaves ] ) , a subject of renewed interest for both mathematicians and physicists , specially with regard to string theory .",
    "perhaps one of the most severe difficulties faced by the conformal boundary consists in the high efforts needed to construct the unphysical spacetime from a given physical metric .",
    "friedrich s conformal equations are a first step towards this direction but they seem to be too complex to allow for an analytical solution in interesting physical cases such as isolated bodies .    despite this difficulty we can still extract useful information out of the conformal methods in many particular cases .",
    "a paradigmatic example is the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes : the group @xmath799 acts _ multiply _ transitively on the spacetime and the transitivity surfaces are spheres @xmath507 .",
    "the most general form of the line element is ds^2=a(r , t)dt^2 - 2b(r , t)drdt - c(r , t)dr^2-l^2(r , t)d^2 .",
    "[ sph ] the @xmath800 part of the metric can always be brought into an explicitly conformally flat form by means of a suitable coordinate change @xmath801 , @xmath802 yielding ds^2=f(t , r)(dt^2-dr^2)-^2(t , r)d^2 .",
    "[ flat-2d ] due to the spherical symmetry the @xmath803 part of the metric contains a great deal of the relevant information about the global causal properties of the spacetime and so we can dismiss the angular part in a first approximation .",
    "this is very useful , since this @xmath803 part can always be conformally embedded in two - dimensional minkowski spacetime in the obvious way .",
    "thus , if we had a finite conformal diagram for the two - dimensional minkowski spacetime , we could represent on them the conformal boundary for ( the @xmath803 part of ) the spacetime under study .",
    "the places where the factor @xmath804 vanishes or diverges , which are typically either infinity or ( removable or essential ) singularities can also be represented .",
    "the required compactification for two - dimensional minkowski spacetime is easily achieved .",
    "let us start with its canonical line - element @xmath805 , @xmath806 , @xmath807 , and let us perform the following coordinate change , bringing infinity to finite values of the new coordinates , t=((|t+|x)+ ( |t-|x ) ) , x=((|t+|x)- ( |t-|x ) ) , under which the line - element becomes @xmath808 the ranges of the new coordinates are @xmath809 , @xmath810 so the conformal embedding of two - dimensional minkowski spacetime in the plane @xmath811 is depicted as shown below .",
    "once we have the penrose diagram for flat spacetime in 2 dimensions , the  relevant \" @xmath803 part of the line - element given by ( [ flat-2d ] ) for _ any spherically symmetric _ spacetime can also be represented in two - dimensional pictures like the above figure .",
    "however , of course , each point of the new picture ( with the exception of the region with @xmath812 if it is not an essential singularity ) represents a @xmath813-sphere . the diagram and",
    "the boundary can adopt many different shapes , and in some occasions the whole @xmath803 region can not be depicted in one single portion of the type of the figure , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the pictures just described , called penrose diagrams , are very useful , ubiquitous in the relativity literature , and they were made popular by carter @xcite and the textbook @xcite . perhaps the simplest example is the diagram of @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime which , given that @xmath814 for such spacetime , can be obtained from the above figure by cutting it through the @xmath815-axis and discarding any of the two symmetric halves . most of the relevant causal information about @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime is kept by its penrose diagram .",
    "penrose diagrams of many relevant spherically symmetric solutions of einstein equations can be found in @xcite .",
    "many others can be found by reading any journal concerning gravity and relativity .",
    "perhaps a very instructive example is the case of anti de sitter spacetime , which is also of present relevance concerning the already mentioned maldacena s conjecture ( or anti - de - sitter / conformal - field - theory correspondence ) .",
    "the inextensible anti de sitter line - element has the form ( [ sph ] ) as follows @xmath816 where @xmath817 and @xmath806 .",
    "it is very simple to check that one can not _ conformally _ embed this spacetime in a _ compact region _ of minkowski spacetime or einstein static universe .",
    "this is why the traditional diagram for anti de sitter spacetime is a non - compact part of einstein static universe with two parallel lines as infinity , and one adds artificially two points @xmath519 to the picture , see e. g. @xcite .",
    "however , one can draw a true penrose diagram following the comments of the previous paragraph .",
    "one forgets about the angular part of the metric and the following change of coordinate @xmath818 brings the line - element to its form ( [ flat-2d ] ) @xmath819 where now @xmath820 .",
    "therefore , a finite penrose diagram can be drawn now by just taking the part of 2-dimensional flat spacetime defined by @xmath821 , compare to @xcite .",
    "this proves that infinity is timelike everywhere . a 3-dimensional representation of anti de sitter spacetime",
    "can then be given as its penrose diagram ; this is shown in the following figure taken from @xcite .",
    "the above discussion is essentially based on the study of the causal properties of the @xmath803 part of the metric ( [ flat-2d ] ) but it is possible to consider other forms for such 2-dimensional metric .",
    "for instance any 2-dimensional metric with a killing vector field can be written in local coordinates as @xmath822 in @xcite constructions of penrose diagrams for 2-dimensional spacetimes with the above line element are pursued and practical recipes to build the diagrams are provided .      in @xmath7[causal - relationship ] we introduced the generalization of conformal embeddings called causal extensions , and defined the causal boundary .",
    "given that the penrose diagrams are based on the conformal compactification , we can generalize these diagrams by using causal mappings . in this way , as with penrose diagrams",
    ", we can try to analyze and understand the properties of complicated spacetimes by studying the simpler ones to which they are isocausal , and by drawing pictures which will generally include the causal boundary  showing some of its properties .    to draw a causal diagram for @xmath2",
    ", we must look for a causal extension @xmath823 ( definition [ causal - extension ] ) . there is no general rule to find an appropriate @xmath30 , but the fact that we are dealing with causal mappings instead of conformal relations may be many times an advantage .",
    "this is so because less restrictive conditions are needed for the isocausality condition @xmath824 , than for a conformal relation @xmath825 .    in @xcite",
    "we presented different explicit examples for which the causal extension was performed explicitly and the causal diagrams drawn .",
    "these diagrams provide a shape and a _ causal character _ for the boundary . a remarkable example which shows how this scheme works and",
    "its applicability is given for instance by the kasner - type spacetime @xmath826 where @xmath827 are constants .",

    "the case with one of the kasner exponents @xmath832 and the rest as before was also treated , and an interesting diagram found in @xcite .",
    "other examples of causal diagrams can be found in @xcite .",
    "plane fronted waves with parallel rays ( pp - waves ) have attracted a lot of interest in recent years specially within the string theory community .",

    "the relevance of these spacetimes is clear as they describe under certain circumstances the simplest ( though highly idealized ) models of exact gravitational waves . a general study of the global causal properties and the causal completions of these and",

    "we believe there is not much to do related to the definition and characterization of abstract causal / etiological spaces , with an important exception : quantum causality and the theory of  causal sets \" outlined in subsection [ quantum ] .",
    "this is a very important line of research , with a strong vitality , and it is worth devoting some efforts in that direction .",
    "the main sought but so far unreached result is how to connect the discrete causal set or spin network with the smooth spacetime we believe to see .",
    "one of the main results presented in this review is the possibility of sorting lorentzian manifolds in abstract causality classes or _ causal structures _ in the sense of definition [ causal - structure ] . in our opinion",
    ", this settles the issue of what the concept of `` causal structure '' of a lorentzian manifold really means .",
    "more importantly , it has allowed a long - standing question to be resolved by means of the theorem [ local - isocausal ] , giving a precise meaning to the _ local _ causal equivalence of lorentzian manifolds .",
    "this also permits us to talk about the causal asymptotic equivalence of asymptotically flat spacetimes , which was only possible if a full conformal completion was previously achieved .",
    "similar local or asymptotic equivalences can be further investigated , and one can easily produce a definition of  asymptotical causal equivalence to @xmath388 \" , where @xmath388 is any particular or preferred spacetime , say , de sitter , or anti de sitter , or a particular robertson - walker geometry , or a plane wave , and so on .",
    "this route is yet to be examined . at the same time , causal mappings ( definition [ prec ] ) enable us to refine the standard hierarchy of causality conditions , and to construct causal chains of causal structures where , on a fixed manifold , we can compare lorentzian metrics from the causal point of view , and classify them according to their  goodness \" in relation to causality .",
    "there are important open problems concerning this line of research which we want to bring to the attention of the mathematical relativity community .",
    "for instance , an even more practical procedure to decide if two lorentzian manifolds are causally related , and then if they are isocausal , would be very convenient .",
    "another question is how many different causal structures can be defined on a given background differential manifold , and whether there exists upper and lower bounds for them in terms of the partial order introduced in subsection [ chains ] . as an additional remark to the previous comments ,",
    "let us stress that the definition of causal structure carries over to abstract etiological spaces ( ergo also to causal spaces ) using the concepts put forward in definition [ theta ] .",
    "thus the results and questions of the above paragraph can be formulated as well for these more abstract spaces being possible to define and classify causal structures for them , and causal completions and boundaries too .",
    "another big issue in this review is the definition of the causal boundary of lorentzian manifolds .",
    "this problem has deserved renewed interest recently in the wake of maldacena s conjecture , and may become a fundamental issue of the subject termed  holography \" ( see @xcite ) : the probable correspondence between string theory on spacetime backgrounds and a conformal field theory _ on the boundary at infinity _ of that background .",
    "prior to this , researchers tried all sort of recipes and methods in order to find a kind of boundary of _ universal _ application to all possible spacetimes .",
    "apart from the inspiring , clear and very fruitful ideas of penrose s concerning the conformal boundary , subsection [ conformal - boundary ] , the main breakthrough here was geroch , kronheimer and penrose s paper described in subsection [ gekrpe ] , but further research proved that strong though this procedure undoubtedly is , it has its own limitations that one should bear in mind .",
    "all the subsequent amendments suggested over the years and described in subsection [ others ] were found either too theoretical , requiring daunting efforts to be applied in practical cases , or not mending the drawbacks they were supposed to mend .",
    "several other alternative constructions were devised with this aim but it is fair to say that they have remained as a set of rather too complicated definitions with no possible translation into explicit relevant examples .",
    "these difficulties to actually construct the causal boundary by whatever procedure have hampered its study in physically relevant cases .",
    "there are fresh good news , however : recently new interesting and encouraging results have been obtained , insufflating renewed air to this subject and arousing again the interest of the mathematical and physics communities .",
    "we are referring specially to    * the startling result that the gkp boundary of certain classes of pp - wave spacetimes consists of a one dimensional null line , see @xmath7[ppwaves ] .",
    "it is quite surprising that this result has been obtained only recently and not , say , twenty years ago . in this sense",
    "it would be interesting trying to find the full gkp boundary in other pertinent cases instead of paying a deeper attention to the wrong topological properties of the boundary in certain spacetimes with strange or unphysical causal behaviours . *",

    "[ causal - relationship ] ) could come in aid . to this end ,",
    "the technical difficulties concerning causal mappings pointed out above should be addressed and , if these problems were resolved satisfactorily , then the causal boundary in the sense of @xmath7[causal - relationship ] , as well as the causal diagrams and causal completions ( @xmath7[causal - diagram ] ) , could be constructed and analyzed explicitly in a large variety of cases very easily .",
    "this would allow us to recover the simple and very powerful applications of the conformal boundaries of spacetimes by keeping their enormous virtues and intelligibility but avoiding on the one hand the traditional problem of the impossibility of finding _ conformal _ completions explicitly , and on the other hand the extreme difficulties to build the other types of causal boundaries , which are also not exempt from inconsistencies , as we have just explained .",
    "causality conditions impose restrictions on the topology and the metric tensor of a spacetime as we explained in section [ sec : candt ] . here",
    "we wish to stress theorem [ bernal - splitting ] which may have interesting applications .",

    "therefore this new result could help improving well - posedness results involving globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "moreover we could adapt formulations of the field equations such as the classical adm to the hypotheses of theorem [ bernal - splitting ] and thereby obtain relevant simplifications .",
    "finally numerical simulations always assume globally hyperbolic spacetimes so one could set the equations modelling the system with a metric tensor as given by theorem [ bernal - splitting ] with no loss of generality .",
    "last but not least , yet another issue we feel worth researching by relativists and mathematicians alike is the subject of section [ symmetry ] , namely , causal transformations / symmetries and their infinitesimal generators , causally - preserving vector fields .",
