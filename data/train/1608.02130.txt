    "ic 2163 suffers a prograde , nearly in - plane encounter as it passes , mainly southward , behind ngc 2207 ( relative to us ) , and its ocular structure forms from outer disk material that loses angular momentum in the tidal perturbation , flows inward until it hits an angular momentum barrier , piles up in the eyelids , and produces a shock zone there .",
    "although in the sph model by @xcite , the outer disk of ic 2163 initially side - swipes the outer disk of ngc 2207 , the ocular shock zone is not the result of direct contact between the two galaxies but develops later from the prolonged prograde encounter .",

    "there are indications of streaming motions around the oval .",
    "however the @xmath13 resolution of the  data is too low compared to the @xmath6 width of the eyelid to get detailed information . in contrast , the spatial resolution afforded by the alma co observations allows us to distinguish between the outer and the inner edges of each eyelid and thus measure the radial and tangential streaming of the gas at the outer edge of an eyelid relative to that at its inner edge .    from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned )",

    "the missing short - spacing data in our alma maps could lead to underestimates of the total co flux of each galaxy .",
    "however , because diffuse co emission will be more spread out than our 2.6 kpc maximum recoverable scale , it should make only a minimal contribution to the molecular column densities of the clumped emission we are studying and is unlikely to affect the velocities at the eyelids which are the main focus of this paper .",

    "for the data analysis we used the aips software package . to select areas of genuine co emission , we convolved the above cube to @xmath25 resolution , clipped it at 2.5 times its rms noise , and retained regions of emission only if they appear in at least two adjacent channels .",

    "our measurements find a relative velocity difference between the outer and inner edges of each eyelid in the direction that produces a compression zone at the eyelids .",
    "although the sense of this velocity difference is consistent with having gas from the outer part of the galaxy flow inwards until it reaches the eyelids , an alternative interpretation would have the inner edge of the eyelids moving outwards with respect to the outer edge . to see if the inner edge of the eyelids is moving radially relative to the center of the disk",
    ", we compare the co value of @xmath180 ( the velocity at the inner edge of the eyelid ) on the kinematic minor axis with @xmath181 .",
    "the values of @xmath181 ( heliocentric , optical definition ) listed by @xcite are @xmath182 km s@xmath16  from the kinematic minor axis of their  velocity field and @xmath183 km s@xmath16  from optical observations at the nucleus .",
    "the co emission at the ic 2163 nucleus is faint and thus not useful for measuring @xmath181 .",
    "after our co velocities are converted to heliocentric , optical definition , the northern eyelid has @xmath180 = @xmath184 km s@xmath16  at @xmath185 , consistent with the  and optical values of @xmath181 .",
    "however the southern eyelid has @xmath180 = @xmath186 km s@xmath16at @xmath187 , which is appreciably higher than @xmath181 .",
    "the difference between the values of @xmath180 on the northern and southern eyelids at the kinematic minor axis can be seen in the color displays of the co velocity field in figure[fig2 ] and figure[fig5 ] where the northern eyelid is dark green and the southern eyelid is light green at these positions .",
    "relative to the center of the disk , the inner edge of the northern eyelid does not seem to be moving radially but the inner edge of the southern eyelid is moving radially outwards .",
    "after the gas streamed radially inward to form the eyelids , the inner edge of the southern eyelid may have started to move outward in a second ocular wave .",
    "under certain conditions in the models by @xcite , a second ocular wave can form and propagate outward .    as noted in section 3.2 above",
    ", the  velocity field reveals a small apparent shift of the dynamic center of ic 2163 to the northeast of the center of the galaxy",
    ".    these various asymmetries may be evidence of a dynamic situation in which the evolution of the ocular is not symmetric about the center of the galaxy because of differences in the near - field tidal forces on the two eyelids as discussed in section 3.4 below .",
    "section 3.3 points out certain velocity asymmetries in the ocular .",
    "relative to us , the near side of ic 2163 is at pa = @xmath188 .",
    "according to the model by @xcite , this is also the side of ic 2163 that was closest to ngc 2207 as ic 2163 traveled behind ngc 2207 from the north and west to its present position partially behind the outer eastern side of ngc 2207 .",
    "this means that most of the northern eyelid , in particular the part with values of @xmath189 km s@xmath16 , is now on the side closest to ngc 2207 .",
    "thus the velocity asymmetries may result from differences in the near - field tidal forces on the two eyelids .",
    "the western end of the northern eyelid connects smoothly in shape and velocity to the tidal bridge arm between the galaxies .",
    "the eastern end of the southern eyelid connects smoothly in shape and velocity to the shocked gas returning to the main disk from the southern side ( leading edge ) of the broad   tidal tail ( see figure[fig1 ] and the co and  velocity fields in figure[fig5 ] ) , which is on the side of ic 2163 farthest from ngc 2207 .",
    "we consider what effect the large differences in velocity across the @xmath3 kpc width of each eyelid have had on the molecular column densities there . in figure[fig7 ] , we plot the los molecular column density @xmath4 from column ( 3 ) of table[table2 ] versus the magnitude of the directional derivative @xmath5 of the velocity with respect to r from column ( 5 ) of that table .",
    "the measurements for the 15 values of azimuth @xmath47 on the northern eyelid are plotted as red points ; those for the 10 values of @xmath47 on the southern eyelid are plotted as blue points .",
    "a linear regression of @xmath4 on @xmath5 for all 25 points in this figure gives @xmath190 for @xmath4 in @xmath70 pc@xmath71  and @xmath19 in km s@xmath16",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.84 with 23 degrees of freedom , and thus there is a strong correlation .",
    "because the northern eyelid has a substantially larger range of @xmath5 than the southern eyelid , the regression tends to be dominated by the data on the northern eyelid .",
    "a linear regression for the 15 values of @xmath47 on the northern eyelid ( the red points in figure[fig7 ] ) gives @xmath191 and a correlation coefficient of 0.87 with 13 degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath5 values in this figure involve a combination of radial and tangential streaming .",
    "we assume that at the eyelids the tangential streaming @xmath192 .",
    "for the northern eyelid , the point for @xmath193 ( where the measured @xmath5 represents pure radial streaming ) and the point for @xmath194 ( where the measured @xmath5 represents pure tangential streaming ) lie on or very close to the fitted line in figure[fig7 ] .",
    "we do not measure the density contrast ( eyelid / pre - eyelid ) directly since our interferometric observations do not detect the pre - eyelid molecular column density .",
    "our choice of value for @xmath195 is listed in section 2 .",
    "if we were to choose a different value of @xmath195 for the eyelids , without varying its value with azimuth along the eyelid , this would change the slope of the fitted line in figure[fig7 ] , but there would still be a strong correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the following factors may lead to some of the scatter seen in figure[fig7 ] and/or decrease the slope of the line .",
    "( a ) after losing some azimuthal velocity in the shock / shear zone in the eyelids , the gas will start to fall inward slowly .",
    "this would tend to decrease its density at the inner edge of the eyelid and should have a stronger effect for stronger shocks . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "the co emission from the southern eyelid appears more ratty at the inner edge than at the outer edge , which may be a consequence of shocks generating turbulence .",
    "( b ) according to the encounter simulations , the gas reaching the eyelid comes in from a range of radii @xmath53 .",
    "the radial compression at the eyelids causes an increase in the gas column density by direct radial impact and also leads to a high rate of shear there .",
    "one expects shocks and compression from the radial streaming and also from the shear associated with tangential streaming ; both types of streaming can lead to intersecting gas streams .",
    "the following argument based on angular momentum conservation computes the rate of shear arising from radial streaming into the eyelids .",
    "consider particles in an annulus bounded by radii @xmath196 and @xmath197 with @xmath198 and initial azimuthal velocities @xmath199 = @xmath200 = @xmath201 ( for a flat rotation curve ) .",
    "if a perturbation kicks particles inward from @xmath196 to radius @xmath202 ( partway between @xmath197 and @xmath196 ) and kicks particles outward from @xmath197 to radius @xmath203 to form a thinner annulus bounded by @xmath204 and @xmath202 , with @xmath205 , then by angular momentum conservation , the azimuthal velocity of particles initially at @xmath196 speeds up to @xmath206 and the azimuthal velocity of particles initially at @xmath197 slows down to @xmath207 the rate of shear between @xmath202 and @xmath204 @xmath208 substituting for @xmath209 and @xmath210 gives @xmath211 then setting @xmath212 , this reduces to @xmath213 the density contrast is @xmath214 comparison of equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) shows the proportionality between the rate of shear and the density contrast : @xmath215 where @xmath216 = @xmath217 is the rate of shear .",
    "the rate of shear and the column density contrast correlate with each other because both result from the radial compression of the eyelid .    from our data",
    ", we are unable to disentangle how much of the observed correlation in figure[fig7 ] is due to direct radial impact and how much is a subsequent consequence of the shocks in the intersecting gas streams that arise from shear .",
    "since intersecting gas streams and shocks in the eyelid compression zone should increase the turbulence there , we consider whether the co observations show evidence of high velocity dispersion in the eyelids .",
    "figure[fig8 ] displays the co velocity dispersion images before and after correcting for the mean velocity gradient across the fwhm of the psf . for the various portions of the galaxy pair indicated by the boxes in the top panel of this figure , table[dispersion ]",
    "lists the mean values of the uncorrected co velocity dispersion @xmath218 , the corrected velocity dispersion @xmath219 , and their rms scatter .    for the spiral arms of ngc 2207 on its western ( anti - companion ) side ,",
    "the mean @xmath219 @xmath220 rms scatter is @xmath221 km s@xmath16 .",
    "this is consistent with the value of the co velocity dispersion that @xcite find for bright co emission in normal , nearby galaxies ; their average for the co mean velocity dispersions in 11 galaxies is @xmath222 km s@xmath16 , with a range of 7 to 15 km s@xmath16 .",

    "the co velocity dispersion in a subtantial part of the eyelids is significantly higher than on the spiral arms of ngc 2207 .",
    "as discussed below , we exclude from the eyelids the three dynamically complex regions labelled a , b , and c in figure[fig8 ] ; they lie outside the range of @xmath47 studied in table[table2 ] . over much of the eyelids ,",
    "the values of @xmath219 are high",
    ". however both eyelids have some regions , e.g. , the irac clumps ir 8 plus ir 9 on the northern eyelid and ir 3 on the southern eyelid ( see figure[fig9 ] for the locations of these clumps ) , where @xmath219 is nearly the same as @xcite find in normal galaxies .",
    "our method of correcting @xmath232 for the mean velocity gradient across the synthesized beam introduced considerable blanking at these locations . the velocity dispersion before correcting for the velocity gradient ( see the top panel of figure[fig8 ] and table[dispersion ] ) is also not particularly high in these regions .",
    "we rule out stellar feedback as the source of the high values of @xmath219 on the eyelids by comparing the locations of the bright clumps of 24  and h@xmath8  emission in ic 2163 ( see figure[fig9 ] ) with where the high values of velocity dispersion occur .",
    "the northern eyelid clumps ir 11 , ir 10 , ir 9 , and ir 8 and the southern eyelid clumps ir 5 , ir 4 , and ir 3 are the most luminous clumps of 24  emission in ic 2163 and are also bright in h@xmath8 . of these , ir 11 , ir 10 , ir 5 ( which partially overlaps region b ) , and ir 4 have @xmath233 km s@xmath16 , whereas ir 8 , ir 9 , and ir 3 have @xmath234 11 km s@xmath16 .",
    "ir 9 is the second most luminous star - forming region in ngc 2207/ic 2163 in 8 , 24 , and @xmath9 cm radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "in contrast , on the northern eyelid , the locations labelled c1 and c2 in figure[fig9 ] have @xmath219 = 27 km s@xmath16  and 35 km s@xmath16 , resp . , but do not contain bright clumps of 24  or h@xmath8  emission .",
    "turbulence generated by the ocular shock front remains as a viable explanation for the high values of @xmath219 on much of the eyelids .",
    "the observed velocity dispersions may be an immediate result of the impact and shear in the eyelids or a subsequent development of microturbulence ( random motions on small scales ) as the components of the gas mix .",
    "gravitational energy powers the microturbulence via gravito - hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the regions of low @xmath219 on both eyelids may be where the microturbulence dissipated , the energy was radiated away , and the gas was not stirred up again .",
    "these regions are farthest along the northern eyelid from the tidal bridge arm and somewhat far along the southern eyelid from the tidal tail .",
    "the presence of high velocity dispersion on substantial portions of the eyelids seems consistent with the prolonged effect of the prograde tidal force exerted by ngc 2207 on ic 2163 and thus in accord with the numerical models for the encounter by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gas streaming radially inward from the outer part of the galaxy may dissipate a lot of translational kinetic energy via shock heating or microturbulence in the eyelid compression zone .",
    "the amount of heating would depend on the details of how the gas flows into the eyelids , which is beyond what we can derive from the present data .",
    "@xcite find that the flux density ratio of 8  to @xmath9 cm  radio continuum emission is a factor of two greater in the irac clumps on the eyelids than elsewhere in this galaxy pair , possibly an indication of shock - heated h@xmath12 in the eyelids .",
    "figure[fig10 ] displays samples of line profiles from the unmasked cube for the various boxes marked with w s in figure[fig8 ] and from region a. at a number of positions in these w - box samples , we compare the value of @xmath218 from fitting the line profile in the unmasked cube with a single gaussian to the value of @xmath218 from the second moment image in the top panel of figure[fig8 ] ( i.e. , from the masked cube ) .",
    "the ratio of the gaussian @xmath232 to the second moment @xmath218 has a mean value of 0.98 , with an rms scatter of @xmath235 . in box w3 and much of box w5 on the eyelids ,",
    "the line profiles are broad ; the high values of @xmath219 result here from elevated turbulence .",
    "the line profiles in boxes w1 and w2 in ngc 2207 are narrow .",
    "region a at @xmath236 is where the northern eyelid joins the tidal bridge arm , and region c at @xmath237 is where the southern eyelid joins the tidal tail .",
    "these are regions of complicated dynamics where the orbits change [ see , for example , fig . 2 in @xcite ] .",

    "region b ( @xmath238 ) where the inner spiral arm seems to join the southern eyelid is another region of complex dynamics . in region",
    "a , many of the line profiles consist of two narrow peaks separated by @xmath239 km s@xmath16 , and thus region a is not a region of high turbulence . in regions",
    "b and c , the situation from the line profiles is less clear .",
    "in the encounter simulations by @xcite and @xcite for this galaxy pair , the prograde tidal force exerted on ic 2163 pulls outward on two opposite quadrants , producing the tidal tail and the tidal bridge , and pinches inward on the other two quadrants , producing the ocular structure . although close , prograde , approximately in - plane collisions between disk galaxies of similar mass are not uncommon , only a few galaxies exhibiting ocular structure are known @xcite because the ocular stage lasts for only an short time , e.g. , the duration of the present ocular disturbance in ic 2163 is of the order of several @xmath163 yr .",
    "our alma @xmath0co @xmath1  observations of the galaxy pair ngc 2207/ic 2163 with @xmath2 resolution provide the first observational confirmation from velocity data with sufficiently high spatial resolution of how ocular structure develops in such an encounter .",
    "this supports numerical models for the effects of close , prograde encounters in general .",
    "we find large los velocity differences @xmath151 across the @xmath6 (= 1 kpc ) width of each eyelid of the ocular , some in excess of 100 km s@xmath16  over a wide range of azimuths .",
    "these are a mixture of radial and azimuthal streaming of gas at the outer edge of the eyelid relative to its inner edge .",
    "the sense of the radial streaming at the eyelids is consistent with the idea that material from the outer part of ic 2163 flows inward until it hits an angular momentum barrier , where the radial streaming slows down abruptly and produces the observed galactic - scale pileup / shock zone at the eyelids . across the 1 kpc width of each eyelid ,",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath5 in the disk - plane are large , with some on the northern eyelid in excess of 150 km s@xmath16  kpc@xmath16 .",
    "radial streaming into the eyelids causes an increase in the gas column density by direct radial impact and also , with angular momentum conservation , leads to a high rate of shear .",
    "we find a strong correlation at fixed values of azimuth between the molecular column density and @xmath5 .",
    "such a correlation may arise from a combination of the shocks produced by direct radial impact and the shocks in the intersecting gas streams resulting from shear .",
    "substantial portions of the eyelids have high co velocity dispersion , which is not a product of stellar feedback .",
    "since turbulence generated by the ocular shock front is an expected consequence of the prolonged prograde tidal force of ngc 2207 on ic 2163 , the presence of high velocity dispersion on the eyelids is in accord with the above numerical models for the encounter .",
    "the sph model for ngc 2207/ic 2163 by @xcite has a full treatment of both galaxies simultaneously and handles gas plus stars but does not have sufficient number of particles or spatial resolution at the level of the eyelid width for predicting the values of @xmath18 as a function of azimuth in the eyelids .",
