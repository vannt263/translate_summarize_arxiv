    "the relations between the black hole mass @xmath1 and its host galaxy bulge properties such as luminosity @xmath2 , stellar velocity dispertion @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 , ( gebhardt et al . 2000 , graham 2007 , kotilainen et al .",
    "2007 ) , suggest a coeval black hole - host galaxy evolution .",
    "it is widely believed that the relativistic jet launched by the black hole might play an important role in this co - evolution , by heating and forcing the cold gas out of the bulge , thus affecting star formation .",
    "so the question arises : is there any relation between the mass of a black hole and the jet it produces ? to effectively address this issue , we need reliable @xmath5 estimations .",
    "black hole masses can be estimated by assuming virialization of the clouds in the blr .",
    "however , studies by arshakian et al . 2010 and len - tavares ( 2010 , 2013 ) have shown that the gas in the blr can be accelerated and ionized by non - thermal emission from the jet .",
    "moreover , absorption features are swamped by non - thermal emission from the jet , thus making impossible to measure @xmath3 .",
    "finally , the empirical relation between the @xmath5 and the bulge luminosity ( @xmath6 ) can be used to obtain homogeneous and bias - free estimations of @xmath5 in the overall population of agn with prominent relativistic jets .",
    "by using the @xmath8 relations ( graham 2007 ) , we estimate the @xmath5 of 29 radio loud agn .",
    "bulge luminosities were estimated by modeling the surface brightness of the host galaxy ( figure [ profiles ] ) with galfit ( peng et al .",
    "2011 ) . thus , allowing us to investigate the connection between @xmath5 and jet properties such as luminosity ( torrealba et al . 2012 ) and lorentz factor ( hovatta et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we find statistically significant correlations between @xmath5 , jet luminosity and lorentz factor .",
    "statistically significant correlations found between @xmath5 and its jet in this work , strongly suggest that the more massive the black hole is , the faster and brighter the jet it produces . these result could be interpreted as an evolutionary connection between the black hole and its relativistic jet",
    ". moreover , these relations could be useful to constraint high energy production models in radio - loud agn .",
    "the manuscript reporting these findings in detail is under preparation ."
