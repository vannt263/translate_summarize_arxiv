    "star formation regions ( hii regions ) are associated with spiral arms of disc galaxies . within spiral arms of grand design galaxies ,",
    "star formation regions are often grouped into structures with sizes of about 0.5  kpc , the star complexes @xcite .",
    "these complexes are the greatest coherent groupings of young stars .",
    "such complexes are formed from hi / h@xmath4 superclouds @xcite .",
    "the size / mass of the largest star formation regions that can appear in a galaxy is determined by the parameters of the interstellar medium , such as the gas density and pressure @xcite .    occasionally , these star formation complexes are located along an arm at rather regular distances .",
    "@xcite found the spacing of complexes ( hii regions ) in studied galaxies to be within 1 - 4 kpc , and each string to consist , on average , of five hii regions . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the gravitational or magneto - gravitational instability developing along the arm can explain this regularity .",
    "@xcite found that in two thirds of cases the regular strings of complexes are seen in one arm only .",
    "the well - known galaxy ngc  628 ( m74 ) is the nearest object from the list of @xcite where the regular spacing of complexes are observed in one arm only .",
    "we believe that the study of the properties of such galaxies can help to better understand the nature of the regular chains of bright star formation complexes .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) we have studied photometric properties of spiral arms in ngc  628 and location of star formation regions inside these arms .",
    "our results confirmed the conclusion of @xcite , that only one of the spiral arms in ngc  628 has the regular chain of bright star complexes .",
    "we also found that the characteristic separation between adjacent fainter star formation regions in both spiral arms of the galaxy is nearly 400  pc .",
    "the main goal of this new research is to study differences between samples of bright star formation regions in two opposite spiral arms of ngc  628 , and to understand why these samples differ from each other . here",
    ", we consider photometric properties , chemical abundances and sizes of the brightest star formation regions in the two principal spiral arms of the grand - design galaxy ngc  628 , based on our own observations in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 passbands , and h@xmath1 line , as well as the _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _ far- and near - ultraviolet ( fuv and nuv ) data .",
    "ngc  628 is a nearby spiral galaxy viewed almost face - on ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5b ] , table  [ table : param ] ) .",
    "it is an excellent example of a galaxy with regular strings of complexes which are seen in only one arm .",
    "@xcite found seven complexes ( hii regions ) with a characteristic separation of 1.6 - 1.7  kpc in one arm of the galaxy ( fig .",

    "the size distribution function of the star formation region population in the inner part of arm  a have approximately the same slope in the entire range studied here ( table  [ table : sfrs_size ] ) .",
    "the size function curves for the populations of arm  b and the inner part of arm  a are very close in the range from 200 to 300  pc , but they vary considerably in the range from 300 to 500  pc",
    ". the size distribution function of the star formation regions sample in the outer part of arm  a is characterized by the shallow slope , @xmath12 , in the intermediate range from 200 to 400  pc ( table  [ table : sfrs_size ] ) .      as we pointed out above",
    ", the distributions of star formation regions by mass and luminosity and the upper limits of mass and size of regions correlate with the overall star formation rate and depend on properties of interstellar medium .",
    "we measured the star formation rates , sfr , and the surface densities of star formation rate , @xmath13 , within the star formation regions using obtained fuv magnitudes , h@xmath1 luminosities and sizes . to accomplish this",
    ", we adopt the conversion factor of fuv luminosity to star formation rate of @xcite , namely @xmath14 in the form @xmath15 and the conversion factor of h@xmath1 luminosity to star formation rate of @xcite : @xmath16    the surface densities of star formation rate within the star formation regions are measured as @xmath17 where sfr and @xmath18 are obtained from eqs .",

    "note that the total star formation rate within studied regions , @xmath19 , is one third of the full sfr in ngc  628 by data of @xcite , who estimated @xmath20 in the galaxy as a whole .",
    "densities of sfr within complexes are typical for star formation regions and comparable to results of @xcite , who found @xmath21 for ordinary complexes in m  51 . bright complexes and fainter star formation regions have similar surface densities of star formation rate ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig23 ] ) .    in spite of the difference in the estimation of sfr(fuv ) and sfr(h@xmath1 ) for some regions , the results are in agreement with each other , in general , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "a dependence of sfr density on galactocentic distance is found for objects of arm  a : @xmath24 for all regions in arm  a , and only @xmath25 for regions with @xmath26 .",
    "the regions in arm  b have a smaller surface density of sfr , on average , than the objects in arm  a , @xmath27 .",
    "differences in the density of star formation rate within star formation regions in arms  a and b may indicate differences in interstellar medium parameters between the arms .",
    "spiral density waves can play an important role in asymmetric star formation in spiral arms .",
    "@xcite showed on the example of the asymmetry in the spiral arms of m51 , that the variable star formation can be caused by more than one spiral density wave .",
    "moreover , an asymmetry in the spiral arms of ngc  628 has been detected in the observed two - dimensional field of radial velocities of the gas in the disc of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "fourier analysis of the azimuthal distribution of the observed radial velocities in annular ( ring ) zones at different distances from the centre of the disc shows the existence of two spiral density waves ( see fig .",
    "1a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the one - armed wave in addition to the dominant two - armed one .",
    "this additional spiral density wave corresponds to the star formation asymmetry in the two main symmetrical arms revealed through the computer - enhanced images of the galaxies by @xcite . in the case of ngc  628 ,",
    "the relatively lower sfr in arm  b can be caused by the asymmetry of the spiral density waves in the galaxy .",
    "in we assumed that the drastic differences observed between the inner structures located in the spiral arms of ngc  628 , one of which hosts the regular chain of large star complexes whereas the other does not , were the result of the existence of a regular magnetic field and the absence of the signature of a shock wave along arm  a. unfortunately , there are no appropriate magnetic field data for the studied part of ngc  628 . the only data concerning the magnetic field were obtained by @xcite who detected polarized emission at 18 and 22  cm wavelengths from the outer part of the galaxy",
    "; their linear beam size was @xmath28  kpc .",
    "the hypothesis proposed in is not the only possible one .",
    "alternatively , asymmetries in spiral galaxies can be the result of gravitational interactions with another galaxy or galaxies at some point in their history .",
    "ngc  628 is a member of a small group of galaxies and its present state may well be the result of close encounters within the group .",
    "close encounters may also trigger episodes of star formation .",
    "the same tidal forces that can deform the galaxy may also disrupt giant molecular clouds within the galaxy and induce their gravitational collapse .",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite show that unbarred grand design galaxies , such as ngc  628 , can only be generated by tidal forces resulting from an encounter with other galaxy .",
    "however , we believe that tidal interactions could not play a role in the origin of the observed asymmetrical pattern of star formation . it is well established that ngc  628 can not have undergone any encounter with satellites or other galaxies in the past 1  gyr @xcite .",
    "the spiral filaments are possibly disturbed by interaction with the two large high velocity gas clouds on either side of the disc @xcite . however , these high velocity gas clouds are located symmetrically with respect to the centre @xcite",
    ". residual velocity fields of both neutral and ionized gas show the absence of significant velocity deviations from the radial velocity @xcite .    in this paper we have found differences in photometric parameters and chemical abundance between the star formation regions in arms  a and b.",
    "we suggest that these differences are the result of significant differences in the physical properties of interstellar medium in the opposite arms of ngc  628 .",
    "as is known , such physical processes as gravitational collapse and turbulence compression play a key role in creation and evolution of star formation regions over the wide range of scales , from smallest ob associations to largest star complexes @xcite .",
    "the age range of stars within ordinary star formation regions is usually quite small ( @xmath29  myr ) suggesting a coherent star formation mechanism , it separates them from large star complexes which have a much larger intrinsic age spread @xcite .",
    "this is well illustrated for the young stellar objects in arm  a , where the large complexes are older than the star formation regions ( @xmath30  myr versus @xmath31  myr ) .",
    "we suggest that the difference between photometric ages of star formation regions in arms  a and b is a result of different star formation histories in them .",
    "the generation of shock - waves is the source of high pressure in arm  b and probably within the inner part of arm  a ( a1 ) .",
    "high pressure stimulates formation of dense star formation regions with an active star formation , including formation of massive ( @xmath32 ) stars @xcite .",
    "high pressure from formed hii regions destroy molecular cloud cores @xcite . as a result",
    ", sfr along arm  b falls for several myr , star formation regions here do not reach large mass / size , and they have approximately the same photometric ages , @xmath3  myr .",
    "the opposite case is observed in arm  a. pressure along arm  a is lower than along arm  b. as a result , doughy large complexes are formed here .",
    "initial sfr is low along arm  a ; massive stars are not formed immediately .",
    "the pressure increase driven by powerful stellar winds from the most massive stars is not high enough to destroy the largest cloud cores . as a result ,",
    "the young stellar objects here have younger ages with a larger dispersion than the star formation regions in arm  b ( @xmath33  myr versus @xmath3  myr ) .",
    "thus , larger star complexes with a lower sfr in the past and a higher sfr now are observed in arm  a , and smaller , more evolved star formation regions are observed in arm  b. this hypothesis is supported by both abundance and photometric data .",
    "it is also fully consistent with the findings by @xcite , who found nine snr candidates in ngc  628 .",
    "five of them are located in arm  a. two out of three latest supernovae , sn  2003gd and 2013ej , are also located in arm  a ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5b ] ) .",
    "neither snrs nor supernovae were found in arm  b.    note that all five sn remnants and two supernovae are located in arm  a between complex a10 found in this work and star formation region a13 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5b ] ) .",
    "it is where the star formation complexes and regions with the highest sfrs are observed ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig23 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that snr  9 and sn  2003gd are located within 1015  arcsec from our star formation region a13 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5b ] ) .",
    "supernova 2003gd has the normal type ii - p , its progenitor was a red supergiant with initial mass @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the life time of such stars is @xmath35  myr .",
    "this is consistent with sustained star formation activity during last several tens myr in this part of the arm .    the same slopes of the luminosity and size distribution functions for the sets of star formation regions in arms  a and b , and the same characteristic separations , @xmath36  pc of star formation regions in both spiral arms , which depend on fundamental parameters of the medium ,",
    "show that large scale fundamental properties of interstellar medium and kinematics of the galaxy have no principal differences in arms  a and b.    in spite of the difference between parameters of star formation regions in the central part of arm  a and other parts of the arms , the large scale ( 2  kpc and more ) density of young stellar population along arms  a and b is the same .",
    "masses of star complexes in the central part of arm  a are 34 times as much as masses of star formation regions in other parts of arms  a and b ( fig .  [ figure : nfig9 ] ) . however , the characteristic separations of star complexes are also 24 times as much as separations of star formation regions .",
    "we assume that the regular chain of star complexes in arm  a can be explained by presence of the regular magnetic field and absence of the shock wave along the arm only for objects a8a12 ( the first five hii complexes from the elmegreens chain ) . in the outer part of arm  a , star formation regions are located more chaotically , the largest star formation complex , a16 ,",
    "is observed here .",
    "this complex is the largest and the brightest one in fuv@xmath37 in ngc  628 ( table  [ table : sfrs_photcor ] ) .",
    "parameters of the complex can be related to its location near the corotation radius @xmath38 ( @xcite obtained @xmath39  kpc or @xmath40 based on a fourier analysis of the spatial distribution of radial velocities of the gas in the disc of ngc  628 ) .",
    "photometric properties , chemical abundances and sizes of the 30 brightest star formation regions in the two principal arms of ngc  628 were studied , based on the _ galex _ ultraviolet , optical @xmath0 , and h@xmath1 surface photometry data .",
    "we found , that the star formation regions in one ( longer ) arm ( arm  a ) of ngc  628 of are systematically brighter and larger than the regions the other ( shorter ) arm .",
    "however , both luminosity and size distribution functions have approximately the same slopes for the samples of star formation regions in both arms .",
    "the star formation regions of arm  a have a higher density of star formation rate than the regions in arm  b. the regions from arm  b show higher n / o ratio at a higher oxygen abundance , but they have lower ultraviolet and h@xmath1 luminosities .",
    "results of stellar evolutionary synthesis show that the brightest regions in arm  a are younger than the ones in arm  b ( @xmath33  myr versus @xmath3  myr ) .",
    "the star complexes in arm  a are slightly older than the star formation regions ( @xmath30  myr versus @xmath31  myr ) .",
    "the results can be explained if we suggest that star formation regions in arm  b had higher star formation rate in the past , but now it is lower , than for opposite arm  a.    our results demonstrate that there is a difference in the inner structures and parameters of the interstellar medium between the two principal spiral arms of ngc  628 . in spite of close sizes and spacing of star formation regions in arm  b and in the inner part of arm  a , modern star formation histories in arms",
