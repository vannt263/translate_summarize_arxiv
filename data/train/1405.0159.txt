    "there are indications of dipole asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) map as reported by planck  @xcite , see also  @xcite",
    ". there are debates on how significant these asymmetries are as were critically reviewed in wmap reports  @xcite .",
    "for example , there were earlier suggestions of the detection of quadrupole asymmetry in wmap data but later analysis demonstrated that the systematic errors can address the apparent source of quadrupole asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , while looking for theoretical explanations of the source of dipole asymmetry , one has to allow for the possibility that there may exist systematic errors which can cause the dipole asymmetry on the cmb map .",
    "it is expected that the second year planck data with new results on polarizations and more data analysis can provide further clues about the reality of the current observed dipole asymmetry .    having the above discussion in mind , we consider the dipole asymmetry as an observed and real phenomenon . a phenomenologically useful way to parameterize the observed hemispherical asymmetry in the comoving curvature perturbation power spectrum @xmath0 on",
    "the cmb is @xmath1 { { \\cal p}}^{1/2}_\\text{iso}(k ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the isotropic power spectrum and @xmath3 denotes the amplitude of the dipole asymmetry .",
    "in addition , the direction of anisotropy is shown by @xmath4 and @xmath5 represents the comoving distance to the surface of last scattering . in the simplest with a scale free asymmetry",
    ", i.e. @xmath6 , the above asymmetric power spectrum translates to the following cmb temperature anisotropy @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the direction of observation .",
    "the recent data from planck observations indicates a detection of dipole asymmetry with the amplitude @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the best fit for the anisotropy direction is @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "note that this hemispherical asymmetry does not survive at smaller scales and it practically vanishes at @xmath12 .",
    "there are also tight constraints on such asymmetry at sub - cmb scales from e.g. quasar observations  @xcite , etc .",
    "this suggests a scale dependent asymmetry @xmath3 .",
    "our main goal in this article is to propose a mechanism fo such scale - dependent asymmetry .",
    "one particular theoretical suggestion for the source of dipole asymmetry is the idea of super - horizon long mode modulation  @xcite .",
    "historically , the effects of super - horizon modes on cosmological parameters were also investigated by grishchuk and zeldovich  @xcite . in this view",
    ", our observed universe may be part of a very large `` super universe '' .",
    "for some unknown reasons , it is possible that one long mode is excited in this super universe with an amplitude much larger than the observed cobe normalization @xmath13 on the cmb scales .",
    "an observer in our observable patch does not have access to the wave - like nature of this perturbation .",
    "instead , for an observer localized in our hubble patch this very long mode causes small changes in the background quantities such as the value of the background inflaton field or the total number of inflationary @xmath14-folds .",
    "this in turn yields a dipole asymmetry which may be viewed as the source of observed dipole asymmetry .",
    "this idea has attracted considerable interests  @xcite , see also @xcite    in order for the super - horizon long mode modulation to generate observable dipole asymmetry one requires a large coupling between the large mode , with wavenumber denoted by @xmath15 , and the smaller cmb scale modes : non - gaussianity in squeezed limit , i.e. in the limit in which one mode has a wavelength much larger than the other two .",
    "this rings the bells in many ways .",
    "first , from the recent planck observations there is no detection of the primordial non - gaussianity  @xcite , so a priori it is non - trivial how one may get large dipole amplitude . secondly , for single field models of inflation ,",
    "the amplitude of non - gaussianity in the squeezed limit , here denoted by @xmath16 , is subject to the non - gaussianity consistency condition  @xcite @xmath17 in which @xmath18 is the tilt of @xmath19 . with @xmath20 from the cmb observations , @xmath16 in standard single field inflation",
    "is too small to generate the observed dipole asymmetry .",
    "this have been demonstrated in a model independent way in  @xcite .    to bypass this difficulty",
    ", one has to break the non - gaussianity consistency relation .",
    "the simplest approach is to employ multiple field models of inflation where non - negligible @xmath16 can be generated  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to consider non - attractor models , where the curvature perturbation is not frozen on large scales so that @xmath16 becomes large  @xcite .",
    "once the system reaches the attractor limit @xmath16 becomes negligible .",
    "this built - in scale - dependence of @xmath16 helps to quickly diminish the dipole asymmetry on sub - cmb scales such as on quasar scales  @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if one starts with the non - vacuum initial states during inflation , large @xmath16 can be generated in the squeezed limit  @xcite .",
    "usually it is assumed that inflation starts with a minkowski or bunch - davies ( bd ) initial condition .",
    "this is the case if inflation lasts for a long period in the past .",
    "however , it is possible that universe may experience a transient period before inflation starts , or there were phase transitions or particle creations at the start of inflation . then , it is natural to consider a generalized , non - bd initial condition . in this article",
    "we consider how starting with a non - bd initial condition can help to produce large scale - dependent dipole asymmetry .",
    "in addition , we will show that non - bd initial condition can induce an enhancement on the amplitude of super - horizon long mode which is responsible for the asymmetry .",
    "this helps to obtain observable asymmetry at the cmb scales .",
    "note , however , that arbitrary non - bd states may not be compatible with the current observations and , even if so , may not lead to observational non - gaussian signatures  @xcite .",
    "we do not aim at constructing explicit non - bd states that survive observational and theoretical constraints , but present generic results that can be applied to viable non - bd cases .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : dipole - fnl ] we review the results obtained in  @xcite relating @xmath21 to @xmath16 for a generic single field model . in section  [ sec : ng ] we study a generic single field model of inflation with a non - bd initial condition which can yield large @xmath16 with non - trivial shape . in section  [ cmb - constraints ] we present the cmb constraints and predictions for the amplitude and the shape of dipole asymmetry with a non - bd initial condition . in section  [ sec : conc ] we conclude .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the relation between the amplitude of the dipole asymmetry and non - linear parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we mostly follow  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to parametrize the effects of the long mode @xmath15 on the cmb modes @xmath22 as given in ( [ p - asym ] ) .",
    "the fractional change due to the long wavelength modulation on the power spectrum is then @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "meanwhile , considering the three - point correlation function in the squeezed limit , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 denoting cmb scale modes , gives @xmath27 \\big\\rangle \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the key equation for our analysis below .",
    "intuitively this equation means that , as long as the small scales perturbations are concerned , the effect of a large scale perturbation is just a rescaling of the background scale factor .",
    "this is motivated from the fact that the small scale perturbations can not probe the spatial variations associated with the long wavelength mode .",
    "this is the case if the long wavelength mode is larger than the hubble patch of the cmb scale modes .",
    "one important assumption for the validity of the above relation is that the whole three - point correlation is generated when the long mode has left the horizon , i.e. after it becomes classical .",
    "that is , there is no correlation between modes when the long mode and hence the small modes are all deep inside the horizon .",
    "this latter condition may be violated in models of non - bd initial conditions in which there is a finite ultraviolet ( uv ) initial time cutoff in the model . as a result , in order for the above relation to be valid , we consider non - bd models in which the initial time cutoff is set to infinity , corresponding to the case in which all modes oscillate rapidly deep inside the horizon , canceling all sub - horizon correlations .",
    "another key assumption for the validity of ( [ rescale ] ) is that there is only one degree of freedom encoded in @xmath28 , so there is no other source of perturbation .",
    "this line of thought was used in @xcite to calculate the amplitude of the non - gaussianity in squeezed limit and to check the non - gaussianity consistency condition for single field inflation models .",
    "equipped with ( [ rescale ] ) we can relate the amplitude of dipole asymmetry @xmath21 to the non - linear parameter @xmath16 as follows .",
    "let us define the bispectrum @xmath29 as @xmath30 comparing with([rescale ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the non - linear parameter @xmath16 in the squeezed limit @xmath33 is defined via @xmath34 combining ( [ b - eq ] ) and ( [ fnl - def ] ) we obtain @xmath35 in which it is understood that @xmath36 represents to the ( small ) cmb - scale perturbations .",
    "since the effects of the long mode modulation is considered as a directional modification of the power spectrum , it is convenient to write the above equation as @xmath37 comparing this equation with ( [ grad ] ) , we finally obtain the following formula for @xmath21 : @xmath38    we can proceed further under the assumption that there exists a _ single _ large super - horizon model @xmath39 with the amplitude @xmath40 and the comoving wavenumber @xmath15 , @xmath41 then , we have @xmath42 now using this into ( [ a - eq ] ) , we obtain @xmath43 this is the consistency condition obtained in  @xcite . note that this formula applies for all models of inflation in which the curvature perturbation has a single source such as in single field models .",
    "this relation was first obtained in  @xcite for the special case of curvaton model .",
    "one comment is in order before we discuss the consistency ( [ afnl ] ) . in writing ( [ rl ] )",
    ", we assume that our observed universe is part of a much larger universe , i.e. a large box universe in the view of  @xcite with the large super - horizon mode @xmath39 being superimposed in our observable universe .",
    "in this view , the quantum fluctuations of @xmath28 associated with the small - scale perturbations inside this large box , @xmath44 , are treated as random statistical variables . in this picture",
    "the size of our observed universe is given by @xmath45 in which @xmath46 is the current hubble constant but the long mode which causes the modulation has the wavelength @xmath47 .",
    "suppose , for our small cmb - scale modes @xmath22 , we work in the fourier space with the volume @xmath48 . for this picture to be consistent , the volume of the fourier space should be bigger than @xmath45 but smaller than @xmath49 so the following hierarchy is at work : @xmath50    in order to use ( [ afnl ] ) for the practical purpose , one has to eliminate the combination @xmath51 using observational constraints .",
    "the simplest constraint is @xmath52 .",
    "this is necessary in order for perturbations to be under control .",
    "secondly , one has to check the constraints from the quadrupole @xmath53 and octupole @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the quadrupole imposes a tighter constraint  @xcite and after eliminating the combination @xmath55 using these constraints one obtain  @xcite @xmath56 in order to obtain an asymmetry consistent with the planck observation we need @xmath57 . for single field",
    "slow roll models of inflation we have @xmath58 and in turn @xmath59 from ( [ a - upper - lyth ] ) , which is too small to explain the observed hemispherical asymmetry . as a result , ( [ a - upper - lyth ] )",
    "indicates that in order to have large observable hemispherical asymmetry one has to violate the non - gaussianity consistency condition .",
    "there are two known mechanism for this .",
    "one is to consider non - attractor models in which the curvature perturbation is evolving on super - horizon scale .",
    "this results in large @xmath16 which in turn yields observable value for @xmath21 as studied in @xcite .",
    "the other is to consider a non - vacuum initial state , i.e. a non - bd initial condition .",
    "it is known that for non - bd initial condition one can obtain large @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the non - gaussianity has a non - trivial shape . in the following sections we study the effects of non - bd initial condition in generating hemispherical asymmetry .",
    "in this section we study single field models of inflation with a non - bd initial condition which can violate the non - gaussianity consistency condition and generate large dipole asymmetry .",
    "we consider a broad class of models of inflation with a non - standard kinetic energy . when building an inflation model , usually the kinetic term is canonically normalized and the potential is set free .",
    "this is however not necessarily the only possibility . in many models originated from e.g. string theory",
    ", we expect corrections to the canonical kinetic term .",
    "these corrections include not only first derivatives @xmath60 but also higher order ones , such as @xmath61 which should however be suppressed by powers of the uv cutoff scale like the planck mass @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we consider the matter lagrangian of the general form @xmath63 with @xmath64 . for canonical case ,",
    "this action includes a large class of models and situations , such as @xmath22-inflation @xcite , dirac - born - infeld inflation @xcite , effective single field model with heavy fields being integrated out  @xcite and so on .",
    "the quadratic action of the curvature perturbation @xmath28 is then specified by defining the `` speed of sound '' @xmath66 additionally , @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and is written as @xmath69 \\ , , \\ ] ] in which @xmath70 is the background scale factor and @xmath71 is the slow - roll parameter .",
    "let us look at the curvature perturbation @xmath28 in fourier space as a quantum operator , @xmath72 in which @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the usual annihilation and the creation operators , @xmath75 is the mode function of the curvature perturbation and @xmath76 is the conformal time . for the bd initial condition ,",
    "the mode function solution at leading order in the slow - roll approximation is given by @xmath77 a good method to obtain a generalized non - vacuum initial state is to perform a bogoliubov transformation on the bd vacuum so the mode function is given by @xmath78 \\",

    "furthermore , a non - zero @xmath80 can be viewed as the presence of additional particle state with the number density @xmath83 per momentum interval given by @xmath84    the important question is what are the physical constraints on the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "there are some simple constraints which should be implemented when considering non - bd initial condition @xcite .",
    "one important requirement is that the total energy density associate with the non - bd fluctuations to be finite . to see this ,",
    "suppose we interpret the non - bd initial state as the state in which there are particle excitations with the number density @xmath83 given by ( [ nk ] ) . as a result",
    "the number density of the quanta in the proper unit volume is @xmath85 .",

    "this can be satisfied if @xmath87 with @xmath88 in the uv region .",
    "one can interpret this as the renormalizability condition .",
    "the second , stronger requirement is that the back - reaction from the non - bd excited states do not stop inflation , which implies that @xmath89 finally , one should make sure that the non - bd fluctuations do not change the near scale - invariant shape of @xmath19 . the change in the tilt of power spectrum , @xmath90 , induced from the non - bd fluctuations is @xcite @xmath91 from the planck data we have @xmath20 so the change in @xmath90 can be at most at the order of few percent .",

    "one convenient modeling is @xcite @xmath121 in which @xmath122 is a number and @xmath123 may be related to the uv cutoff of the theory @xmath124 at the initial time of inflation @xmath125 via @xmath126 . as for the phase @xmath127 , there are two approaches .",

    "our main goal is to check whether or not the amplitude of asymmetry decays on small scales in real space . as mentioned before , there are strong observational constraints from the sub - cmb scales on the amplitude of dipole asymmetry .",

    "the second feature is that due to the scale - dependence of @xmath120 the amplitude of dipole asymmetry oscillates with scales .",
    "both of these predictions can be tested in a careful cmb map investigation . in figure  [ case2 ]",
    "we have presented the second case in which @xmath179 is fixed for all modes .",
    "as expected , there is no oscillation in dipole amplitude .",
    "however , as in the previous case , the amplitude of dipole asymmetry falls off exponentially .",
    "as in previous case , these predictions for the dipole asymmetry can be tested in cmb maps .",
    "but for @xmath180 , independent of scale .",
    "as expected , there is no oscillations in the amplitude of dipole asymmetry while it rapidly falls off on large @xmath160 .",
    "here we have set @xmath172 , @xmath181 and for the momenta in mpc@xmath146 units : @xmath174 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the effective amplitude of asymmetry is @xmath184.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   but for @xmath180 , independent of scale .",
    "as expected , there is no oscillations in the amplitude of dipole asymmetry while it rapidly falls off on large @xmath160 .",
    "here we have set @xmath172 , @xmath181 and for the momenta in mpc@xmath146 units : @xmath174 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the effective amplitude of asymmetry is @xmath184.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    until now we have assumed that a single super - horizon mode was invoked as the source of dipole asymmetry .",
    "alternatively , one may assume a continuum of modes in the range @xmath185 all contribute in which @xmath186 represents the infrared cutoff of the inflationary model .",
    "in the light of  @xcite , @xmath186 may be related to the size of the large box universes @xmath187 via @xmath188 . since @xmath39 is a random variable , @xmath189",
    "is understood as an averaged value , @xmath190 where the average is performed over the fictitious large box where @xmath39 is taken .",
    "then , this reads the first spectral moment and the rest of the analysis will go parallel to single mode modulation case .",
    "notice , however , that to generate a sizable asymmetry we need a coherent variation of all the super - horizon modes in the large box : in general each mode will interfere each other , reducing the amplitude of the resulting asymmetry .",
    "in this work we have considered non - vacuum initial conditions which produce large non - gaussinity in the squeezed regime violating the non - gaussianity consistency condition . as a result large observable hemispherical asymmetry is generated from the long mode modulation with a non - bd initial condition .",
    "we have shown that the amplitude of the dipole asymmetry exponentially falls off on large @xmath160 which can easily address the lack of hemispherical asymmetry on @xmath191 as well as sub - cmb scales .",
    "in addition , depending on the nature of the non - bd vacuum , oscillatory features show up in the amplitude of dipole asymmetry which can be tested in a careful cmb map study .",
    "interestingly , the non - bd initial condition provides a natural mechanism to enhance the amplitude of the super - horizon mode compared to the cmb - scale modes .",
    "this is usually put by hand in simple models with no dynamical explanation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are additional constraints from the cmb dipole , quadrupole and octupole moments which have to be imposed in model parameters as in  @xcite .",
    "these constraints usually put upper bound on the variation of the long mode within our hubble patch , i.e. the combination @xmath192 which appears in ( [ afnl ] ) .",
    "this means that to be able to obtain the observed hemispherical asymmetry , we need to increase @xmath168 to a large enough value .",
    "this can be easily done by reducing the sound speed since there is no tight constraint on @xmath66 in this model , as we discussed before .",
    "having this said , an accurate calculation of low @xmath160 multipoles is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "note that in our approach we have started from power spectrum , not the curvature perturbation itself , so it is not straightforward to calculate multipoles .",
    "final remarks are in order on the primordial tensor perturbation .",
    "there are evidences for the detection of the primordial gravitational waves by the bicep2 observations  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was proposed in  @xcite that the hemispherical asymmetry in gravitational waves may be behind the apparent tension between the bicep2 and planck observations .",
    "this is in the light of proposal in  @xcite in which it is predicted that a hemispherical asymmetry from the long mode modulation in curvature perturbation power spectrum also _ induces _ a hemispherical asymmetry in tensor perturbations .",
    "it will be very interesting to investigate the proposals from  @xcite to see whether or not the dipole asymmetry in primordial power spectra is behind the apparent tension between the bicep2 and planck observations ( see also  @xcite which employed the non - bd initial condition to address the tension between the bicep2 and planck observations ) .",
    "in addition , if the upcoming planck data - release observes the hemispherical asymmetry in tensor mode it will provide a strong support for the idea of long mode modulation and the concept that the observed universe itself is a part of a much larger inflationary universe which can be detected only indirectly such as from the effects of long mode modulation .",
