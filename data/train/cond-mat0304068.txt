    "<S> this hypothesis states a homogeneous transformation of the singular part of the free energy per spin under a change of length unit from 1 to @xmath3 in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath4 and can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the integer space dimension of a translationally invariant system ; the reduced temperature @xmath7 and the external field @xmath8 are supposed to be small ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two exponents associated with the two relevant directions of the renormalization flows . </S>",
    "<S> one notices that a translationally invariant system of dimension @xmath6 is auto - similar and can be considered as a particular case of fractal . in the case of </S>",
    "<S> a _ general _ fractal system , the translational symmetry is broken ; however , a generalization of the space dimension can be done by introducing the hausdorff dimension @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of spins on such system can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the network size . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the widom s hypothesis can be generalized by replacing the factor @xmath14 in eq.([widom_hypothesis ] ) by @xmath15 to describe the decrease of the effective number of spins during the change of the length scale . </S>",
    "<S> since fractals are constructed by iteration of a generating cell , @xmath3 can not take any value ; it must be chosen so that the fractal structure remains invariant under the change of length unit . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behaviors of spin models on fractals whose hausdorff dimension lies between @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been studied intensively by monceau and hsiao and co - workers @xcite and carmona _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , by performing monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the results show the validity of the above generalization . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , a direct verification of the kadanoff s real space renormalization group picture of the ising model in the case of a sierpinski fractal has been achieved by hsiao and monceau @xcite ; they used a monte carlo renormalization group method .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulation works mentioned above have been mainly performed with the help of the monte carlo wolff algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm is able to reduce efficiently the critical slowing down . instead of involving a single - spin flip at each update of the spin state configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the wolff algorithm grows firstly a cluster ( so - called wolff cluster ) and then updates the state configuration by assigning a new state to the spins of this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> much information on the critical behavior of a discrete spin system can be brought out from the geometrical properties of the wolff clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the mean size of wolff clusters for the ising model scales as @xmath18 at @xmath4 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the critical exponents associated to the susceptibility and the correlation length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it provides an alternative way to calculate @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> monceau and hsiao checked that the values of @xmath21 calculated from the wolff mean cluster sizes are consistent with the ones calculated from the behavior of the maxima of the susceptibility with respect to @xmath13 in the case of the sierpinski fractals with hausdorff dimensions betweeen @xmath16 and @xmath17.@xcite moreover , the most striking result they carried out is the scaling invariance of the wolff cluster size probability densities @xmath22 under a suitable rescaling . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling law holds at the critical point and reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the size of wolff cluster associated with a monte carlo step and @xmath3 is some appropriate change of length scale which keeps invariant the fractal structure . </S>",
    "<S> they proved that the exponent @xmath25 is equal to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the critical exponent associated to the magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling law can be understood as a decrease of wolff cluster size by a factor @xmath28 under the change of the length scale @xmath29 . during the simulations of the ising model , the total magnetization @xmath30 and the total energy @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> are calculated at each update of the spin state configuration . </S>",
    "<S> as a matter of fact , the absolute difference @xmath32 between two successive values of @xmath30 is equal to two times the size of the wolff cluster grown during a monte carlo step . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the scaling law described in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scaling_prob_s ] ) is satisfied by the probability density distribution of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that the mean absolute difference @xmath33 between two successive values of the total energy represents two times the surface energy of the wolff cluster . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is much to learn in studying the scaling properties of @xmath33 and the associated probability density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of the surface energy of wolff clusters grown on fractal lattices at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate seven different sierpinski - type fractals of hausdorff dimension lying between 1 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattices are generated iteratively from some generating cells and denoted @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 is the size of the generating cell , @xmath6 is the integer space dimension in which the lattice is embedded , @xmath36 is the number of occupied sites in the generating cell , and @xmath37 is the number of iteration steps . </S>",
    "<S> ising spins are placed at each center of the occupied sites . </S>",
    "<S> the size of @xmath34 is @xmath38 and the number of spins is @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the hausdorff dimension is defined by @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ true _ mathematical fractal is obtained only when @xmath37 tends to infinity ; in this case , we denote it by @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the fractal is not indicated in these symbols . </S>",
    "<S> the seven generating cells @xmath42 we have chosen are    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 : a 2 by 2 square , 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 : a 3 by 3 square where the center sub - square is removed , 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 : a 5 by 5 square where the center sub - square is removed , 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 : a cube of size 2 , 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 : a cube of size 3 where the center sub - cube is removed , 6 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 : a cube of size 4 where the center sub - cubes of size 2 are removed , 7 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 : one removes in addition the 8 sub - cubes at the corners of @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 and @xmath51 are exactly a square and a cubic lattice of infinite size . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the ising model exhibits a second order ferromagnetic phase transition on a fractal , provided that the lattice has a particular geometrical property : the ramification order must be infinite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is the case for the fractals studied here . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the critical temperatures @xmath4 on these fractals are available @xcite and their values are recalled in the table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean absolute value of the wolff cluster surface energy can be calculated from the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total number of monte carlo steps and @xmath54 is the total energy of the _ n - th _ updated configuration . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we found that @xmath55 follows power laws at @xmath4 with respect to the lattice size @xmath13 in the case of the seven different fractals we investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it enables to define a surface exponent : @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the behavior of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath13 in logarithmic coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the points line up along straight lines except for the small sizes , where the scaling corrections due to the finite - size effects are expected . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that these corrections have a topological character and are linked to the slow convergence towards the thermodynamical limit in the case of the fractals with broken translational symmetry @xcite . as a matter of fact , @xmath55 follows perfectly a power law in the case of the translationally invariant lattices @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath13 increasing as a geometrical series covers many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we report the measured surface exponent @xmath59 in the table 1 , where least - square fits are performed from @xmath60 to @xmath61 for @xmath62 , from @xmath63 to @xmath64 for @xmath65 , from @xmath66 to @xmath64 for @xmath67 , from @xmath68 to @xmath69 for @xmath70 , from @xmath71 to @xmath72 for @xmath73 , for @xmath74 , and for @xmath75 , respectively . on the other hand , since monte carlo simulations can be performed only on lattices of finite size and we have omitted the small - size data when extrapolating the thermodynamical limit , a slow crossover behavior may be interpreted as an asymptotic one . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed study shows that the points in fig.1 exhibit a very slight concavity . </S>",
    "<S> the reported value @xmath59 , hence , should be taken as an upper bound in a strict sense ; however , the _ real _ thermodynamical - limit value is expected to be very close to the reported one .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now able to go further and study the scaling properties of the probability density distributions @xmath76 of wolff cluster surface energy . </S>",
    "<S> the curves showing @xmath76 are similar to each other in logarithmic coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest to write down a homogeneous transformation under the form : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are some introduced exponents . </S>",
    "<S> an intuitive guess is to set @xmath78 equal to @xmath80 since it describes the usual surface dimension of a system of bulk dimension @xmath11 . according to eq.([scaling_prob_de ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath55 should scale as : @xmath81 where we have performed the change of variable @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> since the correlation length is divergent at @xmath4 , we can set @xmath3 equal to the lattice size @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 is , therefore , proportional to @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we are , hence , able to obtain a relation linking the exponents @xmath59 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 : @xmath84 the values of @xmath79 calculated from eq.([s_w_y_s ] ) for the seven fractals investigated are given in the table 1 .    the similarity property of the curves showing the probability density distributions @xmath76 and the validity of the homogeneous transformation eq.([scaling_prob_de ] ) can be brought out in the following way : for a given structure at different values of the iteration step @xmath37 , the curves showing @xmath76 collapse onto the one corresponding to the lattice of the largest size @xmath85 under the mapping : @xmath86 fig.2 shows such collapses for the three largest values of @xmath37 on the fractals @xmath87 , @xmath50 , and @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> these data - collapses work out in a reliable way with the values of @xmath79 given in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it confirms that @xmath78 is equal to @xmath80 ( it has also been checked for the four other fractals ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath76 does not exhibit a peak as @xmath22 does . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of segregation between large and small clusters mentioned in ref.@xcite is smoothed in the behavior of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that an important part of the simulation is carried out in updating large clusters ; however , the update of the large clusters does not necessarily imply a large change of the total energy . for a given cluster size </S>",
    "<S> , the probability distribution of the border surface is broad .    </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental question is to know if the introduced exponent @xmath79 is a new one , that is , if it is independent of the two renormalization group eigen - exponents @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the hausdorff dimension @xmath11 . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , it s the first time that the surface energy scaling property of wolff cluster is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> no analytical or theoretical treatment is available . according to our monte carlo simulation results ( table 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath79 seems to be independent of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> whether @xmath79 links to some of the surface exponents of a bulk system @xcite remains an open question . in the table 1 , regardless of the fractal structures , one can find that the values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath79 increase as the hausdorff dimension @xmath11 increases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we do not expect that @xmath89-expansion results can be interpolated to non - integer dimensions and provide the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the fractals , even the value of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> accurate monte carlo studies have shown that the universality of phase transitions on the hierarchical lattices without translational symmetry should depend on the lattice structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath79 associated to the fractals with broken translational symmetry depends on the lattice structure too .    as the wolff clusters are dynamical objects , we exploit here the connection between the surface exponent @xmath79 and the dynamical scaling exponent . </S>",
    "<S> we firstly study the mean square surface energy of wolff cluster @xmath90 we find that @xmath91 lines up along straight lines with respect to @xmath13 except for the small lattice sizes in logarithmic coordinates for the seven fractals investigated ( see fig.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the associated exponent @xmath92 , defined by @xmath93 , could be measured in the same way as described in the previous text for the exponent @xmath59 ; the values of @xmath92 are reported in the table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we , then , express @xmath91 as @xmath94 \\left(1-\\theta_{ee}(1)\\right)$ ] where @xmath95 is the normalized autocorrelation function . </S>",
    "<S> since the autocorrelation time is much longer than 1 ( in some appropriate time unit ) , @xmath96 represents approximatively the negative derivative of the autocorrelation function at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> it enables to define a statistic - fluctuation autocorrelation time @xmath97 and an associated dynamical exponent @xmath98 : @xmath99.@xcite notice that , according to eq.([widom_hypothesis ] ) , the term @xmath100 should asymptotically scale as @xmath101 at @xmath4 , where @xmath102 is the critical exponent associated to the specific heat per spin @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> one should keep in mind that the non - singular part of the free energy per spin gives , in addition , an important contribution in determination of the critical behavior of @xmath103 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we , therefore , have @xmath104 in the thermodynamical limit . with the help of the inequality @xmath105 , </S>",
    "<S> we can link the surface exponent @xmath59 with the dynamical one @xmath98 in the following way : @xmath59 is upper bounded by @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since @xmath91 follows a power law , a homogeneous transformation for the probability density of @xmath107 can be stated ; it takes the following form @xmath108 and has been verified on the seven fractals investigated here . in this case , @xmath109 decreases by a factor @xmath110 under a suitable change of length unit @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar process could be applied in the study of wolff cluster size or the successive change of total magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that @xmath111 and , therefore , @xmath21 is upper bounded by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the statistic - fluctuation dynamical exponent associated to the total magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> it implies @xmath114 .    </S>",
    "<S> the method developed in this paper can be generalized to the study of some physical quantity whose mean value follows a power law with respect to @xmath13 . for instance , since @xmath115 at @xmath4 , one can verify , by constructing a homogeneous transformation for the probability density of @xmath116 similar to eq.([scaling_prob_s ] ) , that @xmath116 decreases by a factor @xmath117 under a suitable rescaling @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> all these results suggest that the scaling properties of some physical quantity at @xmath4 , where the correlation length is divergent , comes originally from the underlying hierarchal structure of a fractal .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the scaling properties of the wolff cluster surface energy in the framework of the ising model in the case of seven different fractals dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> a new scaling relation for the absolute value of the surface energy @xmath33 of the wolff s cluster has been established . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that @xmath33 scales as @xmath118 under an increment of the length unit by the factor @xmath3 , which remains invariant the underlying structure of the fractal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the surface exponent @xmath59 is proved to be upper bounded by @xmath119 .    * acknowledgements * </S>",
