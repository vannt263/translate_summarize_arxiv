    "seismology of solar - type stars is expected in the not - too - distant future to provide information of relevance for understanding stellar structure .",
    "we need to develop tools that will allow us to use the full potential of the information provided by the seismic observations of other stars .",
    "early attempts at inverting artificial sets of low - degree modes have given mixed results .",
    "gough & kosovichev ( 1993 ) and roxburgh et al . ( 1998 ) inverted the frequencies calculated for a 1.1 m@xmath0 and a 0.8 m@xmath0 star , respectively to obtained very encouraging results .",
    "more recently , berthomieu et al . ( 2001 ) carried out a careful analysis of the results to be expected in inversions of solar - like oscillations , taking into account the expected errors in the corot observations and mode amplitudes in a 1.45  m@xmath0 star ; they concluded that reasonably well - localised inversion is possible in the core of such a star . on the other hand , basu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) failed in their attempts at inverting a set of low - degree modes of a solar - type star .",
    "one of the main differences between these efforts was the mode set used for the inversions .",
    "the roxburgh et al .",
    "work used a very optimistic set : it is unlikely that all those modes can be observed .",
    "the gough & kosovichev mode set was somewhat more conservative .",
    "basu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used two conservative mode sets .",
    "the modes sets and errors used in the different works are summarized in table .  1 .",
    "in addition , unlike gough & kosovichev and roxburgh et al . , basu et al .",
    "tried to invert for the sound speed @xmath1 using density @xmath2 as the second variable , instead of inverting for @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the pressure , with the helium abundance @xmath5 as the second variable .",
    "it is known that because density kernels ( at fixed @xmath6 ) have much larger amplitudes than @xmath5 kernels ( at fixed @xmath7 ) , a @xmath1 inversion is more difficult than a @xmath7 inversion .",
    "the basu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) inversions were done under the assumption that the mass , or radius , or both of these properties of the test star was not known very well and hence this introduced additionaluncertainty .",
    "also we believe that there were numerical errors in the kernels used .    in this work",
    "we attempt to understand the differences in the results , in particular we study the effect of the mode set and errors on the results obtained .",
    "the mode sets used are the same as those used by basu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; the mode set of gough & kosovichev ( henceforth the gk set ) is used for comparison . in order to be able to compare with older results we try to invert for @xmath7 rather than @xmath6 which is the variable of choice in solar inversions . to avoid additional uncertainties due to uncertainty in the radius or the mass of the star under consideration , in this work",
    "we confine our attention to solar models .",
    "finally , we note that the assumed errors are much larger than is typical in solar frequencies .",

    "inversions for stellar structure are based on linearizing the equations of stellar oscillations around a known reference model .",
    "the relative differences in @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath19 ) and the difference in @xmath5 ( @xmath20 ) between a star and a reference stellar model can be related to the differences in the frequencies of the star and the model ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normalized distance to the centre .",
    "the index @xmath24 numbers the multiplets @xmath25 .",
    "the kernels @xmath26 and @xmath27 are known functions of the reference model .",
    "the term in @xmath28 is the contribution from the uncertainties in the near - surface region ( e.g. christensen - dalsgaard & berthomieu 1991 ) ; here @xmath29 is the mode inertia , normalized by the inertia of a radial mode of the same frequency . in general , the right - hand side of equation ( 1 ) may also contain a term @xmath30 to absorb scaling of the frequencies with stellar mass @xmath31 and radius @xmath32 according to @xmath33 .    for linear inversion methods , the solution at a given point @xmath34 is determined by a set of inversion coefficients @xmath35 , such that the inferred value of , say , @xmath19 is @xmath36 from the corresponding linear combination of equations ( [ eq : freqdif ] ) it follows that the solution is characterized by _ the averaging kernel _ , obtained as @xmath37 and also by the cross - term kernel : @xmath38 which measures the influence of the contribution from @xmath20 on the inferred @xmath19 .    the surface term in equation  ( [ eq : freqdif ] ) may be suppressed by assuming that @xmath39 can be expanded in terms of polynomials @xmath40 , and constraining the inversion coefficients to satisfy @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "( dppen et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the goal of the inversions is to obtain a localized averaging kernel , while suppressing the contributions from the cross term and the surface term in the linear combination in equation  ( [ eq : invcof ] ) , and limiting the error in the solution .",
    "also , @xmath43 must have unit integral with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "if this can be achieved , then @xmath44 defines a proper average of @xmath19 .",
    "here we use the subtractive optimally localized averages ( sola ) method ( pijpers & thompson 1992 , 1994 ) to determine the inversion coefficients such that the averaging kernel is an approximation to a given target @xmath45 .",
    "details on the application of the sola technique to structure inversion were given by , e.g. , rabello - soares , basu & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1999 ) .",
    "the reference model used in this work is the solar model s of christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "this is a standard solar model .",
    "the test model ( the proxy star ) we use is model mix of basu , pinsonneault & bahcall ( 2000 ) .",
    "this is a non - standard model , with an artificially mixed core .",
    "this model was selected because the differences in @xmath7 with respect to the reference model are large , somewhat along the lines of what we expect for stars other than the sun due to uncertainties in their ages .",
    "[ fig : figavk ] shows a comparison of averaging kernels obtained for @xmath6 and @xmath7 inversions .",
    "the data set used was set  2 , with uniform errors of @xmath10hz .",
    "note that the @xmath6 averaging kernels have a lot of surface structure , which has a detrimental effect on the inversion results .",
    "the mode set needs to be expanded in order to get a cleaner averaging kernel .",
    "[ fig : figcr ] shows a comparison of the cross - term kernels obtained for @xmath6 and @xmath7 inversions .",
    "one can see that with the mode set used ( set  2 ) , we can not successfully suppress the cross term in a @xmath6 inversion .",
    "in contrast , the cross term for the @xmath7 inversions is very small .",
    "[ fig : avkcomp ] shows a comparison of the averaging kernels obtained for @xmath7 inversions using mode sets set  1 , set  2 and gk .",
    "a uniform error of 0.3@xmath46hz was assumed for all sets .",
    "note that the set  1 averaging kernels have structure at the surface .",
    "set  2 and gk kernels are much cleaner .",
    "set  1 also results in very large cross - term kernels .",
    "it should be noted that mola inversions can give somewhat better averaging kernels .",
    "[ fig : all ] shows the inversion results for the three sets .",
    "the horizontal error bars are an indication of the resolution of the inversion .",
    "one can see that the set  1 results have very large errors , as well as poor resolution",
    ". set  2 and gk give very good results for a substantial portion of the core .",
    "a reduction in mode errors helps the inversions .",
    "the effects can be felt in two ways : one could improve the resolution , while keeping the error on the solution the same , or , one could keep the averaging kernel the same and decrease the error on the solution . fig .  [",
    "fig : inv ] shows the inversion results for set  2 for three different error - distributions : ( 1 ) uniform errors of 0.3@xmath47hz , ( 2 ) uniform errors of @xmath48hz , and ( 3 ) an error - distribution which mimics the distribution of errors in solar oscillations frequencies .",
    "the distribution was scaled to be around @xmath14hz at low frequency ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : error ] for the error distribution ) .",
    "the reduction of errors gives a more dramatic improvement for set  1 results .",
    "if the errors are reduced by a factor of 5 , the surface structure of the averaging kernels can be removed and the cross - term kernels can be made much smaller .",
    "in common with other investigations of the resolving power of the low - degree modes expected from observations of solar - like oscillations in distant stars , we find that with realistic assumptions about the expected mode set and observational errors it is possible to achieve some limited resolution in the core of the model . with our present proxy star this ,",
    "for example , shows clear evidence for the core mixing as reflected in the steep rise in @xmath19 towards the centre .",
    "the results depend strongly on the choice of variables in the inversion . for helioseismic inversion ,",
    "a common choice is to express the inverse problem in terms of adiabatic sound speed and density . with the limited set of modes available in the stellar case , the quality of the inversion for the sound speed suffers from the need to suppress the contribution from the density .",
    "a preferable choice of variables is the pair @xmath49 ; here the contribution from @xmath5 is small and essentially confined to the outer layers , where helium is partly ionized .",
    "not surprisingly , the results show substantial dependence on the choice of mode set , although the precise manner in which this happens is not obvious and needs further study .",
    "it is important here also to include more realistic estimates of the expected properties of the modes and observations , as has been attempted by berthomieu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    in analyses of evolved stars it is possible that modes with partial g - mode character may be observed ;",
    "some evidence for this may already have been found in the subgiant @xmath50 bootis ( e.g. christensen - dalsgaard , bedding & kjeldsen 1995 ) .",
    "such modes would have a highly beneficial impact on inversions for the stellar core , because the averaging kernels could exploit the localized trapping of the eigenfunctions .",
