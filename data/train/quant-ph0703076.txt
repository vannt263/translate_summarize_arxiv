    "in quantum field theory the vacuum is not as empty as in the classical physics .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of positive operators , for instance of the square of the smeared electric field , are non - vanishing and there are plenty of states with the expectation values lower then the vacuum ones .",
    "these states are locally `` darker than vacuum '' . while the understanding of this phenomenon progressed constantly over the last decades , with a number of surprising results",
    "having been discovered , attempts were also made to see this non - classical behavior in experiments .",
    "naturally , in order to see sub - vacuum fluctuations it is at least necessary to have detectors capable of seeing and quantifying the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "such detectors , known as balanced homodyne detectors ( bhd ) with local oscillators , were first proposed in the context of quantum optics by chen and yuan @xcite . with their help",
    "the so - called squeezed states of light are seen to exhibit regions with sub - vacuum electric field fluctuations ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we reconstruct the quantum - field - theoretical observables corresponding to photodiodes and balanced homodyne detectors with local oscillators and discuss their quantum - field - theoretical properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the part a of the second section we investigate the interaction of a simple quantum system with the quantum electromagnetic field and derive a formula for the response of a photodiode . the part b deals with an arrangement of two photodiodes known in quantum optics as the balanced homodyne detector .",
    "this part contains four subsections dealing with generalizations of the standard derivation of the observable corresponding to measurements on bhds .",
    "in particular we show in which asymptotic sense the expectation values of the output of bhds , and its variance , are related to the one- and two - point functions of the quantum electromagnetic field ( subsections 1 and 4 ) .",
    "we generalize these results to the case of non - monochromatic local oscillators ( subsection 2 ) and to the case of bhds placed in inhomogeneous environments ( waveguides , casimir cavities , inhomogeneous media ; section 4 ) .",
    "the utility of these generalizations is shown in the appendix a , where we analyze the expected response of bhds placed in casimir cavities ( consisting of two parallel , perfectly conducting plates ) , and argue that substantial , time - independent , reductions of fluctuations ( aka sub - vacuum expectation values of the square of the electric field operator ) are expected .",
    "the third section contains a number of comments on the nature of bhd - measurements and provides a relation to more abstract qft results ( vacuum response , causality and the reeh - schlieder theorem ) .",
    "let us start the discussion with a photodiode , on which a photodetection process takes place in a semiconductor region ( usually the i region of a pin diode ) .",
    "if light is shed upon this region , electron - hole pairs are created . upon creation",
    ", these charges propagate towards and eventually reach the opposite sides of the diode , where they are collected . in this paper",
    "we shall model the detection as an excitation of an electron , initially in a relatively well - localized bound state @xmath2 ( eg .",
    "of an isolated donor atom ) , to the continuum of excited states , @xmath3 .",
    "we will adapt here the of standard treatment of the detection process , presented eg . in the complement @xmath4 of @xcite , or in the section 4.2 of @xcite .",
    "let the dynamics of the electron be generated by the hamiltonian @xmath5 with @xmath6 @xmath2 and @xmath3 being eigenstates of @xmath7 , and the dipole - approximation interaction - hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dipole - moment operator and @xmath10 is the ( quantum ) electric - field operator .",
    "we shall assume , that this field - operator can be replaced by the electric - field operator taken _ at the point _",
    ", @xmath11 , where the donor - atom resides , @xmath12 this simplifying assumption will be argued unnecessary for the bhd in section [ rem2 ] .",
    "the evolution will be determined from the first order time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "we shall use the formulation , @xcite , in which the interaction hamiltonian is multiplied with a smooth function of time , @xmath13 , equal to one in the time interval during which the measurement takes place , and vanishes rapidly just outside of this interval .",
    "the probability of exciting the electron by a given initial state @xmath14 of the quantum field is just the expectation value of the ( time - evolved ) projection operator on the excited states of the electron , say @xmath15 , taken with respect to the state @xmath16 of the full system .",
    "the well - known first order perturbative expression for this probability is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the evolution operator with the interaction controlled by @xmath13 , and the measure @xmath19 , specifies the final , scattering states of the electron .",
    "the above expression can be written in a compact form : @xmath20 where symbolically @xmath21 , while @xmath22 stands for the unperturbed ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath7 ) energy difference between the excited and the ground state of the electron and @xmath23 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a symbolic star notation , such that @xmath24      the primary purpose of a bhd with a local oscillator ( lo ) is to investigate the states of the radiation field , which alone hardly trigger photodiode s response , eg .",
    "vacuum / ground states .",
    "consider the setup presented on the figure 1 .",
    "the observable corresponding to the charge collected at @xmath25 is the difference of the outputs of the photodiodes : @xmath26    , ( if present ) is `` blended '' with a coherent state ( lo ) , which is polarized orthogonally to @xmath14 , on the polarizing beam splitter ( pbs1 ) . the half wave plate ( hwp ) , reflects the planes of polarization with respect to its optical axis , thereby inducing @xmath27 shift of the plane of polarization of the signal field @xmath14 .",
    "the subsequent pbs2 separates the two orthogonally polarized signals , which are detected at the photodiodes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the charge collected at @xmath25 provides a measure of the expectation value of the observable @xmath30 ( and of its higher moments ) .",
    "note , that the setup is arranged in such a way , that if @xmath14 happened to be a monochromatic coherent state , it would be phase - matched to the lo at the point @xmath31 , but shifted in phase by @xmath32 at the point @xmath33 . ]    in experiments with bhd the state under investigation is `` blended '' with a strong , precisely controlled coherent state ( lo ) .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the state of the radiation field under investigation ( that is : the state of the quantum field _ without _ the local oscillator present ) .",
    "in a typical experimental setup ( fig .",
    "1 ) the polarising beam splitter , pbs1 , superposes physically the state @xmath14 and the lo .",
    "the blending has a `` coherent character '' and therefore we adapt one of the definitions of the coherent state to describe it : @xmath34 \\rangle_{(s , f)}=\\langle p[f_i(t,\\v x)+e_i(t,\\v    x)]\\rangle_s,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 denotes the electric field of the lo .",
    "the symbol @xmath36 above stands for an arbitrary observable ( polynomial ) constructed out of the ( smeared ) electric field operators , while @xmath37 denotes the state resulting from the blending of the local oscillator coherent field into the state @xmath14 under consideration .",
    "we choose the lo field to be monochromatic and linearly polarized , so that at every point @xmath11 we may write @xmath38,\\ ] ] with a real vector @xmath39 and the frequency @xmath40 .",
    "the phase @xmath41 , which depends on the point @xmath11 , can be varied at will in experiments . per definition",
    "the detector is arranged ( balanced ) is such a way that @xmath42 the expectation value of @xmath30 for the detector balanced in this way is @xmath43 -\\right.\\\\    -\\left.[f(\\tau , \\ay)\\star \\langle e(s,\\ay)\\rangle_s+\\langle e(\\tau,\\ay)\\rangle_s",

    "the integration leads to terms involving @xmath53 of these , clearly the term @xmath54 dominates the other three , because @xmath55 are all greater than zero , and the fourier transform of @xmath13 is concentrated around the zero frequency with a rapid decay away from it .",
    "this , as explained in the appendix a , essentially enforces the restrictions @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the integrations over @xmath19 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "at this point let us make a simplifying assumption that we are dealing with an electron in a spherically symmetric initial state , @xmath59 , with the energy @xmath60 which after excitation becomes a plane wave @xmath61 , and thus @xmath62 and a fixed value of translates into a fixed value of @xmath63 .",
    "in a real semiconductor both of the functions @xmath2 , @xmath3 are different but , of course , for a given crystal they are very well known . with these assumptions",
    "we find @xmath64 with a certain function @xmath65 .",

    "analogously we find @xmath75 the expectation value of the output of the bhd detector , @xmath76 , eq .",
    ", is therefore given to the leading order by @xmath77      it must be stressed , that the limit @xmath78 taken here with the assumption of monochromaticity of the local oscillator field , which leads to , is not physical and mathematically troublesome ( intergating the response for infinitely long times / smearing with singular test functions leading to products of delta functions for products of operators of the type ) . to avoid these troubles one should replace @xmath79 by a frequency - dependent function @xmath80 and integrate over @xmath73 .",
    "the function @xmath80 can be for instance such as to correspond to `` pulsed '' almost - monochromatic local oscillators ; the equation is then replaced by @xmath81 with a smooth @xmath82 sharply peaked around the frequency @xmath73 of the local oscillator .      for quantum fields in non - trivial static environments ( waveguides , cavities or materials with position - dependent @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) ,",
    "the electric - field operators possess a generalization of the decomposition @xmath85,\\ ] ] where the multi - index @xmath86 corresponds to the parameters of electromagnetic waves supported by the environment ( such as types of waves and their wave vectors ) , @xmath87 denotes the ( electric field of the ) solution of the maxwell equations with these parameters and @xmath88 denotes the appropriate measure .",
    "the frequency , @xmath89 , is given by an appropriate dispersion relation .",
    "the functions @xmath87 are normalized so that @xmath90=\\de(p^a - k^a)$ ] .",
    "the generalization of eq .",

    "this seemingly straightforward generalization has the profound effect of making the commutator of positive and negative frequency part of the field operators position ( @xmath93 dependent .",
    "as a consequence there may be reduced fluctuations of _ both _ so - called quadratures of the quantum field .",
    "an example of this is presented in the appendix [ casimir ] .      for many interesting states @xmath14 , the expectation value of the electric field operator ( and thus the leading term of @xmath94 ) vanishes , for instance if @xmath14 is the ground / vacuum state , or an eigenstate of the photon - number operator , or a superposition of pairs of photons - eg . the squeezed state .",
    "let us present the expectation value of the square of @xmath30 in the ideal case of monochromatic lo and homogeneous media .",
    "the calculation is trivial as we manipulate the operators , under the expectation value , which are a product of two independent expressions .",
    "the leading term of @xmath95 is given by @xmath96\\bigl[e_j(\\th,\\ax)|_\\w+ e_j(\\th,\\ay)|_\\w\\bigr]\\big\\rangle_s.\\ ] ]",
    "we note the following :    * @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath98 , that is to the power of the local oscillator field ; by taking measurements with growing values of @xmath98 the value of the fluctuations of the electric field in the state @xmath14 can be quantitatively estimated .",
    "this is the standard signature checked for in experiments , see eg . @xcite .",
    "* should one wish to compare @xmath97 of two different states on the decibel scale , the dependence on the yet unspecified parameter , @xmath99 , and lo power drops out , and the result depends only on the ( frequency - restricted ) two - point functions of the states under consideration .",
    "* if the state @xmath14 can be assumed to have certain symmetries , a further simplification of the form of @xmath97 is possible .",
    "for instance if @xmath100 is the poincare invariant ( usual ) vacuum , then @xmath101 ( the spatial orientation of the photodiodes plays a role here . ) * all the operators are restricted to the frequency , @xmath73 , of the lo ; therefore time is here @xmath102 periodic , and thus @xmath103 is the measure of time with @xmath102 corresponding to the period of the lo wave .      with regard to the interaction hamiltonian which has been employed ,",
    ", we note that we could have taken it without the restriction on the electric - field operator , eq . ;",
    "its frequencies would nonetheless get restricted to the frequency of lo ( at the bhd ) and the large wavelength of light waves of this frequency ( against the essential support of @xmath2 ) would lead to the same formulas for the output of the bhd . moreover , because of the standard relation @xmath104 which is generally valid if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath7 , the same expressions for the expectation values of @xmath30 and @xmath105 would have been obtained had we started with the interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath106 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath107 is supported in a compact region and that @xmath13 is also of a compact support ( in time ) .",
    "then the quantum - field - theoretical observable corresponding to @xmath108 is just an integral ( over @xmath19 ) of a product of two electric field operators smeared with test functions supported in the spacetime region @xmath109 .",
    "such an observable is qft - localized in the smallest double - cone . ] containing this region . as a consequence ,",
    "two such observables localized in causally separated double - cones will commute ( and thus have their probabilistic distributions unconstrained by heisenberg - like uncertainty relations ) .",
    "moreover , since the operator corresponding to @xmath108 is clearly positive , it can not annihilate the vacuum because otherwise by the theorem of reeh and schlieder@xcite it would necessarily be a null operator ( vacuum is separating for the local observables ) .",
    "thus , strictly , photodiodes are not `` photon counters '' , as they exhibit non - null vacuum response .",
    "these `` vacuum - effects '' were also encountered in @xcite , and are related to causality problems of hagerfeldt @xcite ( see also the subsequent clarification by buchholz and yngvason @xcite ) .",
    "we have corroborated the result , that the output of a balanced homodyne detector provides a quantitative measure of the n - point functions of the states of the quantum electric field .",
    "moreover we have shown how this result can be generalized to the case of detectors placed in inhomogeneous environments .",
    "non - trivial effect are expected in such a case , as is shown in the appendix a dealing with quantum fields and bhds outputs in casimir cavities ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our investigation supports the view , that bhd - like detectors are suitable for measurements of intriguing qft effect such as negative energy densities present for instance for squeezed states , and thus provide a tool for testing recent theoretical predictions associated with quantum energy inequalities @xcite .",
