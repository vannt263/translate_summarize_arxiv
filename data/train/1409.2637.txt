    "the action principle for general relativity in four dimensions can be formulated by requiring that it should be constructed out of curvature invariants and that its variation should lead to second order field equations for the metric .",
    "indeed in four dimensional space - time it can be easily shown that the only action that satisfies these two requirements is the einstein - hilbert action plus a cosmological term . rigorously speaking one",
    "can add to the gravitational action also a gauss - bonnet term @xmath2 as its variation does not affect the equations of motion being just a boundary term .",
    "this is only true in four dimensions as in five or higher dimensions the variation of the gauss - bonnet term gives a non - trivial contribution to the equations of motion which however remains of second order in the derivatives of the metric . in seven dimensions one can add another term to the gravitational action which is constructed from cubic curvature invariants and whose variation is again of second order in the metric . more generally in an @xmath3-dimensional space - time",
    "it is possible to construct an action which is the sum of @xmath4 $ ] independent terms which are of up to the @xmath5$]th power in the curvature and whose variation gives second order field equations for the metric .",
    "this gravity theory is known as lovelock gravity  @xcite , and it is the most straightforward extension of general relativity to higher dimensions as it is constructed according to the same principles as used for four dimensional general relativity .",
    "einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity is the most simple non - trivial example of lovelock gravity and its action is the sum of a volume term @xmath6 an einstein - hilbert term @xmath7and the gauss - bonnet term @xmath2 , each term having its own coupling constant .",
    "the reason why this action has attracted a lot of interest in theoretical physics is also because the low energy limit of some string theories ( see , for instance , the discussion in  @xcite ) is described by einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity rather then general relativity .",
    "actually the idea that space - time may have more than four dimensions is much older than string theory as it was already proposed by kaluza  @xcite and in an attempt to unify gravity with the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "originally one extra dimension was considered . in order to encompass also non - abelian gauge fields , more extra dimensions must be added .    assuming the existence of extra dimensions arises of course the question of why these are not visible to us .",
    "the most standard explanation of this is to assume that the extra dimensions are compactified to a very small scale , which however opens the question of why the extra dimensions are of almost constant size in time while the three macroscopic space dimensions are expanding at approximately constant rate . in @xcite , it was shown for the first time how to construct a realistic static compactification in seven ( or higher ) dimensions in lovelock gravities .",
    "a suitable class of cubic lovelock theories allows to recover general relativity with an arbitrarily small positive cosmological constant in four dimensions and with the extra dimensions of constant curvature .",
    "the drawback of this construction is that it involves a fine tuning between the coupling constants and moreover it does not provide a dynamical description of the compactification .",
    "this is actually of great interest as it may be that in the far past the extra dimensions were of approximately the same size as the three macroscopic space dimensions .",
    "historically compactification of lovelock gravity has begun to attract the interest of researchers already in the 80s  @xcite .",
    "the first question that arises in this context is the existence exact or static compactified solutions where the metric is a cross product of a 3 + 1 dimensional manifold times a constant curvature `` inner space '' .",
    "such an exact static solution can be interpreted as a ground state of the kaluza - klein theory .",
    "these exact solutions are also known as `` spontaneous compactification '' in literature .",
    "the existence of such solutions were first discussed in  @xcite where the four dimensional lorentzian factor was actually minkowski ( the generalization for a constant curvature lorentzian mainifold was done in  @xcite ) .    in the context of a cosmological model it is necessary to study a metric with time dependent scale factors .",
    "the most simple ansatz is given by assuming a constant size of the extra dimensions and the four dimensional factor being a frw manifold .",
    "this has been studied in  @xcite where the attention was put on exact solutions with exponential scale factor . in the last paper",
    "it was explicitly stated that a more realistic model needs to consider the dynamical evolution of the extra dimensional scale factor . in the context of exact solutions",
    "such an attempt was done in  @xcite where both the 3-space and the extra dimensional scale factors where exponential functions .",
    "solutions with exponentially increasing 3-d scale factor and exponentially shrinking extra dimensional scale factor were found .",
    "the drawback of these solutions was that an exponentially shrinking to zero radius of the extra dimensions is phenomenologically problematic as the radius of the extra dimensions is related to the strength of the gauge field couplings",
    ".    in  @xcite the structure of the equations of motion for lovelock theories for various types of solutions has been studied .",
    "it was stressed that the lambda term in the action is actually not a cosmological constant as it does not give the curvature scale of a maximally symmetric manifold . in the same paper the equations of motion for compactification with both time",
    "dependent scale factors were written for arbitrary lovelock order in the special case that both factors are flat .",
    "the results of  @xcite were reanalized for the special case of 10 space - time dimensions in  @xcite . in  @xcite the existence of dynamical compactification solutions",
    "was studied with the use of hamiltonian formalism .",
    "more recent analysis focuses on properties of black holes in gauss - bonnet  @xcite and lovelock  @xcite gravities , features of gravitational collapse in these theories  @xcite , general features of spherical - symmetric solutions  @xcite and many others .",
    "cosmological `` counterpart '' of this field was also intensively studied both numerically for a wide variety of cosmological models  @xcite and analitically mostly in attempts to find exact solutions  @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance are @xcite where the dynamical compactification of ( 5 + 1 ) egb model was considered , @xcite , with the metric _ ansatz _ different from what we are about to consider , and @xcite of which the present paper is direct continuation in the sense that now we consider all possible regimes . to be more precise ,    in all the cited papers the search for solutions never went beyond the ansatz of exponential scale factor or beyond the search of criteria for the existence of solutions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the equations of motion are too difficult to find an exact generic solution even in the case of constant size of the extra dimensions . on the other hand it is of great interest to analyze more generic solutions in order to understand all the possible regimes of dynamic compactification . in order to do this a numerical analysis",
    "must be performed .",
    "this has been done in  @xcite where the scale factor of the extra dimensions again was kept constant .",
    "it is however of great interst to analyze the problem also with a dynamical scale factor for the extra dimensions as a constant extra dimensional scale factor would imply a strong conspiracy of the initial conditions whose space may in this case have zero measure .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to make a numerical analysis for dynamical compactification where both scale factors are time dependent and where no a priori assumptions are made on the functional form of the scale factor or on the sign of the curvature of both factors of space - time .",
    "another aim of this paper is to get a systematic classification all possible dynamical compactification regimes of the most generic einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity in arbitrary dimensions and with arbitrary coupling constants . in order to perform this analysis",
    "we will make an _ ansatz _ of a warped product space - time of the form , where @xmath8 is a friedmann - robertson - walker manifold with scale factor @xmath9 whereas @xmath10 is a @xmath0-dimensional euclidean compact and constant curvature manifold with scale factor @xmath11 .",
    "we will then study the dynamical evolution of the two scale factors . to be as generic as possible curvature",
    "will considered in both in the extra dimensions and in the spatial section of the four dimensional part of the metric .",
    "this is of special interest as in most cases , when considering gauss - bonnet , or even higher - order lovelock gravity , in literature only spatially flat sections are considered . considering the case with non - zero spatial constant curvature",
    "allows to see the influence of the curvature on the cosmological dynamics .",
    "despite the fact that , according to current observational cosmological data , our universe is flat with a high precision , at the early stages of the universe evolution the curvature could comes into play .",
    "in there , negative curvature only `` helps '' inflation ( since the effective equation of state for curvature is @xmath12 ) , while the positive curvature affects the inflationary asymptotics , but its influence is not strong for a wide variety of the scalar field potentials ( see  @xcite for details ) , so that we can safely consider both signs for curvature without worrying for inflationary asymptotics .",
    "the equations of motion are highly nonlinear and therefore it is technically impossible to integrate them in a closed form .",
    "however it is possible to understand in detail all the relevant features of the theory , depending on the values of the couplings and of the curvature of space and extra dimension , by performing a numerical analysis .    in order to make a complete classification of all possible regimes of the dynamical compactification",
    "it is important to notice that the volume term in in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , is not directly related to the cosmological constant . to demonstrate it",
    "let us consider egb action in the vielbein formalism    @xmath13    and vary it with respect to the vielbein to obtain equations of motion    @xmath14    the `` cosmological constant '' indeed measures the curvature scale of a maximally - symmetric space - time solution .",
    "a maximally symmetric space - time has curvature two form given by    @xmath15    which inserted in the equations of motion gives a quadratic equation for @xmath16 :    @xmath17    which admits as solutions    @xmath18    due to the fact that the einstein - gauss - bonnet action is quadratic in the curvature , the equations of motion for a maximally symmetric space - time _ ansatz _ will give a quadratic equation for the curvature scale ( [ polynomial ] ) .",
    "this means that , in general , einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity admits up to two maximally symmetric space - time solutions ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "it is however also possible that the discriminant of the quadratic equation ( [ polynomial ] ) is negative so that a maximally symmetric solution does not exist at all .",
    "this special situation in combination with a negative curvature of the extra dimensions has been studied in @xcite and it was the first time where a phenomenologically reasonable dynamical compactification scenario , where the size of the extra dimensions and the four dimensional hubble parameter tend to a constant , without fine tunings or ad hoc matter fields was found .",
    "another important feature of this theory , in opposition to gr , is that by compactifying the space - time to @xmath19 where @xmath8 is a four dimensional space - time and @xmath10 is some compact manifold with constant curvature @xmath20 is that the newton constant of the effective four dimensional theory is not just proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "this can be seen by projecting the @xmath22 dimensional equations down to four dimensions    @xmath23    where the lowercase indices run from zero to three .",
    "the term @xmath24 which multiplies the four dimensional curvature two form @xmath25 is the `` effective newton constant '' whereas the term @xmath26 is an `` effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant '' .",
    "this means that if the gauss - bonnet term does not vanish and moreover the @xmath0-dimensional curvature does not vanish the effective newton constant is not just proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , the effective newton constant can even have a negative sign .    in this paper",
    "we want to obtain a more complete picture by studying all the possible dynamical compactification regimes for the most generic einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity",
    ". a numerical analysis making a scan over a reasonably broad region of the initial conditions space will be performed .",
    "special attention will be given to the late time evolution of the scale factors and if they describe a phenomenologically sensible scenario .",
    "the structure of the paper will be the following : in the next section the detailed numerical analysis and some basic discussion are performed and in the last section we discuss the results in detail and summarize them .",
    "the _ ansatz _ for the metric is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 stand for the metric of two constant curvature manifolds @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth to point out that even a negative constant curvature space can be compactified by making the quotient of the space by a freely acting discrete subgroup of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the complete derivation of the equations of motion could be found in our previous paper , dedicated to the description of the particular regime which appears in this model  @xcite . in the first part of the analysis we will for simplicity",
    "consider the case with @xmath33 ( zero spatial curvature for `` our '' ( 3 + 1)-dimensional world ; we will then later , in order to be as generic as possible also analyze effect of a non - zero @xmath34 on the compactification regimes . for the moment the non - zero curvature for extra dimensions can be normalized as @xmath35 .",
    "since there is no curvature term for @xmath9 , it is useful to rewrite the equations of motion in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath36 ; the equations will take a form    @xmath37 + \\\\ \\\\",

    "one of the important results of this paper is that the different dynamical regimes must be classified according to the value of the effective cosmological constant ( [ leff ] ) rather then to the value of the `` lambda term '' .",
    "it was found that most of the regimes do not lead to physically reasonable scenarios as they develop either finite future time singularities ( standard or nonstandard ) or isotropization of the entire space - time , where the size of the extra dimensions becomes of the same size than the one of the macroscopic three dimensional ones .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the singularities found in our analysis are quite different from the more common ones such as big rip and similar to them ( see e.g. @xcite )  indeed , in our case the singularities are anisotropic so that the volume of the entire space do not need to diverge  it could become singular or even remain constant  the latter is true for nonstandard singularities . with regard to the nonstandard singularities it is also worth mentioning that the same kind of singularity but called `` determinant singularity '' was found for bianchi - i with dilaton in  @xcite .",
    "this proves that the nature of this `` nonstandard singularity '' lies entirely in nonlinearity of the equations of motion .",
    "the only phenomenologically sensible scenario turned out to be the the case when the curvature of the extra dimensions is negative and when one chooses the region of the couplings space @xmath89 so that the theory does not admit a maximally symmetric vacuum solution ( or in other words when the effective cosmological constant is complex ) .",
    "this scenario , which is independent from the sign of @xmath83 , can be interpreted as a symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "remarkably it does not require neither fine - tunings , as the region of the parameter space is an open set , nor violations of `` naturalness hypothesis '' .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the similar result  the dynamical compactification without violation of `` naturalness ''  was proposed in  @xcite for the ( 5 + 1)-dimensional egb theory .",
    "as one can see , our setup is different from the one used in @xcite  we considered both @xmath10 and @xmath8 as manifolds with constant and possibly nonzero curvature , which gives a rise to additional curvature terms and , as a consequence , to a new regime .",
    "additionally , we considered all possible geometrical terms , including the volume term ( @xmath90 ) , which crucially affects the dynamics . overall , despite the fact that in both cases  in @xcite and in our paper  we can see dynamical compactification , it is brought by different phenomena . in our case",
    "it is `` geometric frustration '' ( see  @xcite ) , which is brought by a combination of nonzero curvature and nonzero volume term  both of them are usually omitted from consideration since they complicate the equations a lot .",
    "the presence of non - zero curvature in the four dimensional part of the metric does not change qualitatively the the analysis .    in the analysis we have supposed the torsion to be zero .",
    "however in first order formalism the equations of motion of egb gravity do not imply the vanishing of torsion which is therefore a propagating degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "indeed exact solutions with non - trivial torsion have been found @xcite . to study its effects in the context of dynamical compactification",
    "will be object of future investigation .",
    "egb gravity is the simplest generalization of general relativity within the class of lovelock gravity .",
    "as we considered an arbitrary number of extra dimensions it would also be interesting to study the effect of higher order lovelock terms in the compactification mechanism .",
    "the results obtained in this paper suggest that the effects of higher terms depend sensibly on the fact if the highest curvature power is even as only in this case there exist a region in the parameter space which admits no maximally symmetric solution .    in the context of egb theory existence of this region",
    "is solely due to the @xmath90 , as one can see from ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "taking into consideration this ( @xmath90 ) case obviously makes the system far more difficult to solve  especially if one look for exact solutions  but it bears its fruits , as one can see .",
    "indeed , when looking for exact solutions often only the simplest case is considered , and additional solutions are lost ; this might be the case why this behavior has not been found earlier .    _",
