    "for central collisions of sn on sn ( @xmath1sn+@xmath1sn , @xmath2sn+ @xmath1sn and @xmath2sn+@xmath2sn ) a well - known result is that the ratio of isotope yields from two different reactions , 1 and 2 , @xmath3 exhibits an exponential relationship as a function of the isotope neutron number @xmath4 and proton number @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6 this is called isoscaling . note that for sn on sn central collisions the fragmenting system is rather large .",

    "much effort has gone into trying to relate @xmath0 to the symmetry energy term that occurs in liquid drop binding energy formula . in its simplest version",
    "the symmetry energy term is given by @xmath7 .",
    "it is reasonable to guess that the ratio @xmath8 should predominantly depend on @xmath9 or equivalently on @xmath10 of the fragmenting systems and also on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "an approximate functional relationship that can be deduced from models is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 refers to the disassociating system in reaction 1 , @xmath14 refers to that in reaction 2 and @xmath15 is the characteristic temperature in the two reactions .",
    "it is this approximate equality that we examine in this work , first in a mean - field model ( section iii ) and then , in detail , in thermodynamic model using both canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "in particular we point out a different functional relationship is more natural in certain physical situations .",
    "next we turn to cases where isoscaling is only approximate and how such cases can be handled in the theoretical framework .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in section x.",
    "equation ( 1 ) can be easily understood using a grand canonical model for multifragmentation .",
    "this allows us to relate @xmath0 to chemical potentials .",

    "can be taken care of in an approximate way using the wigner - seitz apporoximation @xcite . in this expanded volume",

    "one can do refinements to this model .",
    "for example as the temperature increases , the nucleus will expand @xcite which will cause some quantitative changes .",
    "but we will not pursue these finer details .",
    "we now go back to the multifragmentation model that we briefly alluded to in section ii .",
    "assume that the system with @xmath84 nucleons and @xmath85 protons has temperature @xmath15 , has expanded to a higher than normal volume and the partitioning into different composites can be calculated according to equilibrium statistical mechanics .",

    "details of the implementation of the canonical model can be found elsewhere @xcite ; here we give the essentials necessary to follow the present work .",
    "the canonical partition function is given by @xmath88 here the sum is over all possible channels of break - up ( the number of such channels is enormous ) which satisfy @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; @xmath91 is the partition function of one composite with neutron number @xmath92 and proton number @xmath93 respectively and @xmath94 is the number of this composite in the given channel .",
    "the one - body partition function @xmath91 is a product of two parts : one arising from the translational motion of the composite and another from the intrinsic partition function of the composite : @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the mass number of the composite and @xmath97 is the volume available for translational motion ; @xmath97 will be less than @xmath98 , the volume to which the system has expanded at break up .",
    "we use @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the normal volume of nucleus with @xmath85 protons and @xmath101 neutrons . in this calculation",

    "the expression includes the volume energy , the temperature dependent surface energy , the coulomb energy and the symmetry energy .",
    "the term @xmath116 represents contribution from excited states since the composites are at a non - zero temperature .    for most of the calculations here",
    "the dissociating system is @xmath117 for reaction 1 . for reaction 2",
    ", the dissociating system is @xmath118",
    ". these will represent @xmath1sn+@xmath1sn central collisions and @xmath2sn+@xmath2sn central collisions after pre - equilibrium particles are emitted .",
    "these two systems have received much attention in the past .",
    "we also have to state which nuclei are included in computing @xmath107 ( eq.(17 ) ) . for @xmath119 ,",
    "( the neutron and the proton number ) we include a ridge along the line of stability .",
    "the liquid - drop formula above also gives neutron and proton drip lines and the results shown here include all nuclei within the boundaries .",
    "the long range coulomb interaction between different composites can be included in an approximation called the wigner - seitz approximation .",
    "we incorporate this following the scheme set up in @xcite .",
    "computations of observables with the canonical model can be done without an explicit use of a chemical potential .",
    "we can , however , compute the chemical potential using the thermodynamic identity @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "we know the values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "we now briefly review the grand canonical model . for finite systems such as considered here",
    "it is inferior to the canonical model but is easier to implement .",
    "if the numbers of neutrons and protons in the dissociating system are @xmath101 and @xmath85 respectively , the ensemble contains not only these but many others but the average value can be constrained to be @xmath101 and @xmath85 .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath68 and @xmath128 serve to fix the average numbers .",
    "if the neutron chemical potential is @xmath68 and the proton chemical potential is @xmath128 , then statistical equilibrium implies that the chemical potential of a composite with @xmath4 neutrons and @xmath5 protons is @xmath129 .",
    "the following are the relevant equations for us .",
    "the average number of composites with @xmath4 neutrons and @xmath5 is @xmath130 there are two equations which determine @xmath68 and @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath131 @xmath132 the sum here is over all nuclei within drip lines whose @xmath133 do not exceed @xmath134 since there can not be a composite whose @xmath27 exceed those of the system from which it emerges .",
    "we want to point out the following feature of the grand canonical model . in all @xmath26 s in the sum in the above two equations",
    ", there is one common value for @xmath97 ( see eq.(18 ) ) .",
    "we really solve for @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the values of @xmath68 or @xmath128 will not change if we , say , double @xmath87 and @xmath97 simultaneously provided the number of terms in the sum is unaltered .",
    "we then might as well say that when we are solving the grand canonical equation we are really solving for an infinite system ( because we know that fluctuations will become unimportant ) but this infinite system can break up into only certain kinds of species as are included in the above two equations . which composites are included in the sum is an important physical ingredient in the model but intensive quantities like @xmath137 depend not on @xmath87 but on @xmath135 and @xmath136 . to apply the grand canonical model to finite systems after solving for @xmath138 s we plug in the value of @xmath97 that would be appropriate for the system @xmath9 . if the system which we are investigating is small , experimental data may show substantial deviations from the grand canonical model as we will verify later .    for later application",
    ", we will also use a slightly different version of the above equations @xcite .",
    "we label two other chemical potentials : @xmath138 ( fixes baryon number ) and @xmath139 ( fixes total charge ) : @xmath140 @xmath141 here @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 with @xmath145 .    for @xmath146 and @xmath147 the @xmath68 s of the grand canonical model",
    "are compared with those derived from the canonical model in fig.2 .",
    "the values are very close .",
    "we also compare the @xmath36 in the two models .",
    "the computation of @xmath138 whether in canonical or grand canonical requires solving complicated equations .",
    "however it may simplify as @xmath148 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we try this in the canonical model first .    as @xmath148 the translational degree of freedom",
    "can be considered frozen .",
    "let @xmath149 be stable against spontaneous dissociation ( if @xmath149 is one of the nuclei within neutron and proton drip lines then it can not spontaneusly decay into a neutron(proton ) plus a daughter ; usually the only other channel one needs to check is an alpha plus daughter ) . as @xmath148 , the system will drop to the ground state of @xmath149 and we will have ( eq.(17 ) ) @xmath150 with @xmath151 now given by @xmath152 .",
    "consequently we get @xmath153 .",
    "this result is of course physically meaningful : @xmath154 is simply the separation energy required to free a neutron from bound nucleus @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath155+\\kappa z_0 ^ 2[a_0^{-1/3}- ( a_0 - 1)^{-1/3 } ]   \\\\ term2 & = & c_s[\\frac{(n_0-z_0)^2}{a_0}-\\frac{(n_0 - 1-z_0)^2}{a_0 - 1}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for us @xmath156 is of greater significance .",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath157 for @xmath36 we need to take the difference between two chemical potentials .",
    "@xmath158 of eq.(28 ) contributes little in the difference and thus we end up with familiar eq.(4 ) , i.e. , @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "eq.(16 ) can also be obtained but as an approximation to eq.(30 ) .",
    "we can rewrite eq.(30 ) as @xmath160 for the examples we are using , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the third term in the right hand side of the above equation is much less important than the second term .",
    "if we neglect the third term and as before also term1 we end up with eq.(16 ) , i.e. , @xmath163 .",
    "let us see if we can get a sensible answer in the grand canonical model .",
    "we will use the the alternative forms eqs ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) : @xmath138 controls the baryon number and @xmath139 the total charge .",
    "so long as we maintain the general form of eqs.(26 ) and ( 27 ) , that is , include in the sum all particle stable nuclei with @xmath164 the limits of @xmath138 and @xmath139 are very difficult to obtain even at the zero temperature limit . in particular we can not have mutiplicity 1 in the ground state of the dissociating system @xmath149 and zero occupation in all other composites in the sum in eqs .",
    "( 26 ) and ( 27 ) ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "exclusive occupation in the ground state of @xmath149 can be achieved in the canonical model but not in the grand canonical ensemble as this violates a fluctuation equation .",
    "we will deal with that equation but let us look at this first in a more pedestrian fashion . at zero temperature",
    "the translational degree can be considered frozen . from eqs .",
    "( 26 ) and ( 27 ) , to get mutiplicity 1 we need @xmath165 as @xmath166 .",
    "this alone is not enough to determine @xmath138 or @xmath139 but we also require @xmath167 to maximise at @xmath168 so that at other values of @xmath5 the difference is negative and occupation in @xmath169s other than @xmath85 will go to 0 as @xmath166 .",
    "the maximisation condition gives @xcite @xmath170 having determined @xmath139 , the value of @xmath138 can be found from @xmath171 .",
    "this precudure ensures that @xmath167 is negative for @xmath172 and hence as @xmath166 the occupation in composites labelled by @xmath173 with @xmath172 will go to zero .",
    "but this does not guarantee that @xmath174 will be less than zero for all @xmath175 s less than @xmath84 with @xmath5 s less than @xmath85 that are in the sum of eqs .",
    "( 26 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "in fact they are not all negative and whenever they are postive , multiplicities for those @xmath176 s blow up .",
    "another way of understanding this is to realise that for sole occupation in @xmath177 there are three conditions to be met : @xmath178 must ( 1 ) go to 0 at @xmath86 , ( 2 ) must maximise as a function of @xmath5 at @xmath149 and ( 3 ) must maximise as a function of @xmath175 at @xmath149 . with only two parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 this can not be achieved .",
    "we can also deduce the impossibility of exclusive occupation in the ground state of @xmath149 from very general arguments about fluctuations .",
    "it is easy to prove this when there is only one kind of particle ( eqs.(19 ) to ( 21 ) in @xcite ) . with 2 kinds of particles , neutrons and protons and hence 2 chemical potentials @xmath138 and",
    "@xmath139 the notation gets complicated .",
    "quite generally , the equation for the grand canonical partition function , when there are many species @xmath179 which are non - interacting , is given by @xmath180 in our case @xmath179 stands for both @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the composite mass and charge ; @xmath183 is the canonical partition function of @xmath184 particles of type @xmath179 ; @xmath184 goes from 0 to @xmath185 as we are constructing a grand partition function .",
    "we have @xmath186 .",
    "we need not specify the functional form of @xmath183 .",
    "eq.(34 ) can be rewritten as @xmath187 where we have absorbed the factors @xmath188 in @xmath189 which is quite complicated but it only contains partition functions with total particle number @xmath190 .",
    "we clearly have ( fluctuation equation ) : @xmath191 in our case @xmath192 is particularly simple : @xmath193 and @xmath194 if @xmath195 for @xmath196 and 0 for all others then @xmath197 but this contradicts the assumption that the only occupation is for @xmath198 in which case the fluctuations would have been 0 .    in spite of this conceptual difficulty ,",
    "the expression for @xmath68 derived from the grand canonical ensemble in @xcite and that derived here from canonical ensemble are not that different .",
    "in particular @xmath36 will be practically the same . for completeness",
    "we write the two , one after the other .",
    "that in @xcite is @xmath199\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas we get @xmath200+\\kappa z_0 ^ 2[a_0^{-1/3}- ( a_0 - 1)^{-1/3}]+c_s[1-(\\frac{2z_0}{a_0})^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the contribution of the symmetry energy to @xmath36 in the more general case will be function of temperature and not a constant as implied in eq.(4 ) .",
    "this can most readily be seen by analytically deriving @xmath36 at high temperature .",
    "let us derive this in the canonical ensemble first .",
    "at very high temperature we will get only neutrons and protons and so eq.(17 ) becomes particularly simple : @xmath201 the formula @xmath202 $ ] leads to @xmath203 and hence @xmath204 and thus not a function of the symmetry energy at all .",
    "it is easy to verify that in this high temperature limit the grand canonical ensemble gives identical answers . from @xmath205 towards a large value of @xmath15 this must happen gradually and so @xmath36 must be an evolving function of @xmath15 .",
    "we are unable to derive a simple formula for @xmath36 for a general @xmath15 .",
    "the reasons for this failure are obvious enough .",
    "eqs.(24 ) and ( 25 ) are highly non - linear and thus the grand canonical ensemble provides no simple leads .",
    "the relevant equations for the canonical model are easy to compute on a computer but otherwise are quite non - transparent . in fig.3",
    "we show as a function of temperature ( relates to beam energy of collision ) numerical results for @xmath36 for the two systems studied here .",
    "two results are shown ; one with @xmath206 mev and another with @xmath207 mev .",
    "extracting the value of @xmath11 from @xmath36 using eq.(4 ) is difficult because of temperature and hence beam energy dependence .",
    "notice that at high temperature , the curves obtained with different values of @xmath11 approach one another .",
    "they will converge to one line which will rise linearly with @xmath15 .",
    "a very interesting aspect of the experimental data is the behavior of @xmath36 when @xmath208 varies for fixed @xmath209 or vice versa . in the thermodynamic model this depends on the beam energy .",
    "there is no such dependence in eq.(4 ) .",
    "the simple prediction of eq.(4 ) is compared with thermodynamic model predictions in fig.4 . in the model , for fixed @xmath209",
    ", @xmath36 is still approximately linear with @xmath210 although deviation can be seen by eye - estimation .",
    "it is also noticed that use of eq.(4 ) to estimate @xmath11 from @xmath36 will underestimate the value of @xmath11 at low temperature ( 4 or 5 mev ) but will overestimate the value at high temperature , for example , at 7 mev .",
    "experiments directly measure @xmath211 rather than @xmath68 and we plot @xmath0 from the thermodynamic model as a function of temperature in fig.5 .",
    "we also obtain @xmath0 from eq.(4 ) and compare .",
    "eq.(4 ) gives a @xmath212 dependence but the fall with @xmath15 is much slower in the thermodynamic model at higher temperature . in the thermodynamic model",
    "@xmath0 would reach asymptotically a constant value @xmath213 .",
    "this difference in behavior between the two predictions can be ascertained in experiments .",
    "there has been much activity in recent times relating @xmath0 to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "an approximate derivation of eq.(4 ) from the expanding excited source ( ees ) model can be found in @xcite .",
    "attempts to obtain this from antisymmetrised molecular dynamics can be found in @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of symmetry energy was discussed by li and chen @xcite .",
    "we now discuss isoscaling and possible deviations from it . it will become clear in this and the following section that , from the point of view of theory , isoscaling can work very well when @xmath214 and @xmath215 are small ( @xmath216 .",
    "many experimental data fall in this range @xcite and isoscaling is one robust feature to emerge in recent experimental intermediaite energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "if we now extend these observations to larger composites deviations are to be expected .",
    "will the grand canonical and canonical results for @xmath217 always agree ?",
    "the answer is no ; it depends upon the size of the dissociating system ( @xmath9 ) , more precisely , upon the fractions @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the grand canonical model always predicts isoscaling . in this model @xmath218 where we have used eq.(2 ) and the advantage that with similar beam conditions the factors @xmath26 in the denominator and the numerator cancel each other out .",
    "therefore , in the grand canonical approximation , the slopes of @xmath219 as a function of @xmath4 for fixed z ( a ) will never deviate from a straight line and ( b ) for different fixed @xmath5 s the slopes will not change .",
    "in many experiments where the sizes of the composites @xcite encompass from small to large this is not true . in fig.6",

    "all composites between drip lines are included as detailed in section iv with the highest values of @xmath27 terminating at @xmath9 .",
    "the limitations of the grand canonical model are very obvious in the figure .",
    "the slopes of @xmath219 differ from straight lines for large @xmath5 and as well the same slope for all @xmath5 does not fit . in these calculations",
    "the same temperature was assumed for all composites .",
    "the actual situation may be more complicated requiring a different temperature for higher composites .",
    "however the deviation from linearity will require even further complications if one insists on using the grand canonical model to fit the data .",
    "from the point of view of theory , however , for the emitting systems in these cases , the use of the grand canonical approximation for the emissions of heavier composites is not valid .",
    "the canonical model does not impose these restrictions .",
    "now ( see eq.(20 ) ) @xmath225 this formula is not transparent at all but produces deviations from isoscaling for small systems .",
    "let us show the results of the canonical model calculation for the same case as above : ni on be .",
    "the parameters for the calculations are the same as used for the grand canonocal model : the same temperature , the same freeze - out volume and the same composites included in building the respective partition functions .",
    "but the canonical calculations ( fig.7 ) are significantly different from the grand canonical results ( fig.6 ) and much closer to experimental data .",
    "instead dealing directly with @xmath226 let us investigate a simpler task : that of relating @xmath18 in canonical with that in grand canonical . the formula for @xmath18 , eq.(20 ) , respects constancy of total neutron and proton numbers in the partition function and in this regard is superior to eq.(23 ) .",
    "if @xmath214 or / and @xmath215 are not small ( for some cases in figs.6 and 7 they are @xmath227 ) , eq.(20 ) can give quite different results from those given by eq.(23 ) .",
    "this is so even when the chemical potentials given by the two models are very close . if the chemical potentials in the two ensembles are nearly the same ( as found in all our examples so far ) that merely guarantees that @xmath228 here the left hand side is given by the canonical model ( and leads to the definition of fugacity and chemical potential in the canonical model ) and the right hand side is computed from the grand canonical model ( eqs.(24 ) and ( 25 ) ) .",
    "however , for @xmath18 to be nearly the same in the two ensembles we require @xmath229 we show below how the left hand side of the above equation can lead to the right hand side when @xmath214 and @xmath215 are small but are expected to deviate when they are not small . to proceed",

    "the first term in the right hand side of the above equation is the neutron fugacity of the system @xmath235 , the second term is the neutron fugacity of the system @xmath236 and so on ; finally ending with neutron fugacity of the system @xmath237 .",
    "if @xmath4 is negligibly small compared to @xmath101 and also @xmath5 is negligibly small compared to @xmath85 then each of these terms can be approximated by neutron fugacity of the system @xmath9 ( for @xmath238 20 and @xmath239 20 in fig.7 , this leads to gross errors ) leading to @xmath240 . equating @xmath241 to @xmath242 we get the factor @xmath243 of eq .",

    "it then follows that although at low @xmath27 canonical and grand canonical calculations can agree they will diverge when @xmath27 grow .",

    "how well does eq.(4 ) , a much used formula , fit results from calculations obtained from well - known models of nuclear dissociation ?",
    "we find the fit approximately correct though not exact ( the mean field model gives a different formula but the mean field model is not a model for multifragmentation ) .",
