    "we consider the uplink and downlink of a cellular multihop / mesh system ( e.g. , ieee 802.16j systems ) , with one base station , one fixed relay station and @xmath0 users .",
    "the role of the relay station is to enhance end - to - end link quality in terms of capacity , coverage and reliability using multihop routing techniques @xcite , and its presence allows the base station to choose between ( i ) sending / receiving data directly to / from a given user , ( ii ) communicating over a two - hop route where the base station sends data to the relay station and the relay station forwards the data to the users in downlink , and vice versa for the uplink .",
    "we refer to this communication model as the _ multiuser relay channel _ ; which includes both the multiaccess relay channel ( uplink ) @xcite and broadcast relay channel ( downlink ) @xcite .    for fixed portable applications , where radio channels are slowly varying , multiple access methods based on opportunistic scheduling mechanisms take advantage of variations in users channel quality and allocate resources such that the user with the best channel quality is served at any given time or frequency ( could be subject to certain fairness and delay constraints ) .",
    "it has been shown by the pioneering works @xcite-@xcite that the sum capacity under such opportunistic scheduling algorithms increases with the number of users ; yielding _ multiuser diversity _ gains by exploiting the time and frequency selectivity of wireless channels as well as the independent channel variations across users .",
    "_ relation to previous work : _ while multiuser diversity concepts over traditional cellular systems is well understood , there are open issues on the design and analysis of resource allocation and opportunistic scheduling algorithms in relay - based cellular multihop networks .",
    "recently , low - complexity resource management methods for ofdma - based cellular multihop networks were proposed in @xcite-@xcite , and were shown to simultaneously realize gains from both multiuser diversity and multihop relaying to enhance capacity and coverage . moreover , in @xcite , tools from extreme - value theory were used to characterize the spectral efficiency of opportunistic scheduling algorithms over fading multiuser relay channels in the asymptotic regime of large ( but finite ) number of users , and to provide insights on the role of multiuser diversity , multihop routing and spectrum reuse techniques in leveraging the system - level performance .",
    "finally , applications of opportunistic communication principles to relay - assisted wireless networks were investigated in various other contexts in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "_ contributions : _ the prior art on the analysis of opportunistic scheduling algorithms over the multiuser relay channel has focused on spectral efficiency , which is clearly",
    "an important performance metric given the scarcity of bandwidth resources in a cellular network and system operation in the bandwidth - limited regime .",
    "often however , each user s mobile terminal in a cellular network could additionally be severely constrained by its computational and transmission / receiving power and/or could be subject to poor signal quality due to path loss and shadow fading effects of the wireless channel ( e.g. , mobile terminal in a coverage hole at the cell edge ) , leading to system operation in the power - limited regime , where the optimization of energy efficiency becomes crucial in system design .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand the key merits of multihop relaying techniques jointly in terms of their energy efficiency and spectral efficiency advantages in the presence of multiuser diversity gains from opportunistic ( i.e. , channel - aware ) scheduling and identify the regimes and conditions in which relay - assisted multiuser communication provides a clear advantage over direct multiuser communication . for this purpose ,",
    "we use shannon - theoretic tools to analyze the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency ( known as the power - bandwidth tradeoff ) over a fading multiuser relay channel with @xmath0 users in the asymptotic regime of large ( but finite ) number of users ( i.e. , dense network ) . benefiting from the extreme - value theoretic results of @xcite",
    ", we characterize the power - bandwidth tradeoff and the associated performance measures of the high and low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regimes , and utilize them in investigating the large system behavior of the multiuser relay channel as a function of the number of users and physical channel snrs .",
    "our analysis results in very accurate formulas in the large ( but finite ) @xmath0 regime , and provides insights on the impact of multihop relaying and multiuser diversity techniques on the power - bandwidth tradeoff .",
    "consider the network depicted in fig .",
    "[ micro_net ] with @xmath1 nodes , in which @xmath0 users , indexed by @xmath2 , send / receive information to / from a base station .",
    "the relay station is designated to help users transmit / receive information utilizing its high capacity backhaul link to the base station .",
    "in other words , multiple users share a single relay for uplink and downlink ( i.e. multiaccess and broadcast ) .",
    "we assume that all the links over the multiuser relay channel are corrupted by additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "furthermore , the links between the base station and users are assumed to be under frequency - flat multiplicative fading i.i.d . across users , with complex channel gains @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a real - valued random variable representing the channel power gain for the link between the base station and user @xmath5 , drawn from an arbitrary continuous distribution @xmath6 with @xmath7=1,\\,\\forall k$ ] .",
    "the average received snr between the base station and each user equals @xmath8 .",
    "analogously , the links between the relay station and users have average snrs given by @xmath9 , stands for `` base '' station and @xmath10 stands for `` relay '' station . ] and are under frequency - flat fading i.i.d . across users , with complex channel gains @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents the channel power gain for the link between the relay station and user @xmath5 , drawn from an arbitrary continuous distribution @xmath13 with @xmath14=1,\\,\\forall k$ ] .",
    "the set of channels @xmath3 and @xmath11 are independent .",
    "it is assumed that the cellular backhaul link between the base station and relay station is an awgn line - of - sight ( los ) connection with received snr equal to @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , our channel model concentrates on the quasi - static regime , in which , once drawn , the channel gains @xmath3 and @xmath11 over the multiuser links remain fixed for the entire duration of a time slot allocated for codeword transmission i.e. , each codeword spans a single fading state , and that the channel coherence time is much larger than the coding block length , i.e. , slow fading assumption . due to",
    "slow fading , each terminal in the multiuser relay channel is able to obtain full channel state information regarding its transmission / reception links . because the transmission rate of each codeword over each hop is adaptively chosen so that reliable decoding is always possible ( the data rate is changed on a codeword by codeword basis to adapt to the instantaneous channel fading conditions ) , system is never in outage provided that the coding blocklength is arbitrarily large .    for the following analysis",
    ", we assume a time - division based ( half duplex ) relaying constraint for multi - hop routing protocols , which is due to the practical limitation that terminals can often not transmit and receive at the same time .",
    "in particular , we consider a two - phased decode - and - forward protocol ; where , for a given routing path between the base station and a given user , the relay station hears and fully decodes the transmitted data signal in the first phase and forwards its re - encoded version in the second phase .",
    "moreover , we consider the use of point - to - point capacity achieving codes only ( without any kind of cooperation across terminals ) over all transmissions over the multiuser relay channel and do not impose any delay constraints on the multihop system ; in contrast , we allow each coded transmission to have an arbitrarily large blocklength , although we will be concerned with the relative sizes of blocklengths over multiple hops .",
    "this section describes our methodology for evaluating power - bandwidth tradeoff in multiuser relay channels and accordingly introduces the key measures of energy and spectral efficiency to be used in our performance characterization . as part of the prior art in this respect ,",
    "the analytical tools to study the power - bandwidth tradeoff in the power - limited regime have been previously developed in the context of point - to - point single - user communications @xcite-@xcite , and were extended to multi - user ( point - to - multipoint and multipoint - to - point ) settings @xcite-@xcite , as well as to adhoc wireless networking examples of single - relay channels @xcite-@xcite , awgn multihop networks @xcite-@xcite and dense multi - antenna relay networks @xcite . in the bandwidth - limited regime ,",
