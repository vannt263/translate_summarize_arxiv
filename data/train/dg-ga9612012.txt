    "we follow the ideas in @xcite and @xcite . because @xmath11 is time independent",
    ", the set @xmath12 of critical points of @xmath13 can not be discrete : assume a critical point @xmath14 is a nonconstant loop , then @xmath15 produces a @xmath16-family of critical points .",
    "therefore standard nondegenerate floer theory does not apply .",
    "we have to take into account the singular @xcite or de rham @xcite ( co)homology of @xmath12 leading to a double complex .    in the general case",
    "the @xmath17-gradient flow lines of @xmath13 between different connected components @xmath12 will enter the construction , but here they can not exist as different components lie in different connected components of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the bott - type floer complex reduces to the singular chain complex of the critical manifolds , whose components are diffeomorphic to @xmath3 , and so @xmath19 where @xmath20 indicates that we consider only loops in @xmath5 whose symplectic action is less or equal to @xmath21 .",
    "this set is denoted by @xmath22 . the direct sum in ( [ eq : floer - bott ] ) parametrizes the connected components of @xmath22 .",
    "the grading @xmath23 is provided by a generalized conley - zehnder index associated to any element of @xmath12 plus half the local dimension of @xmath12 .    on the other hand one can perturb @xmath11 by a time dependent function ( potential ) @xmath24 on @xmath3 , such that @xmath25 consists of isolated critical points and in this case standard floer theory applies ( this is the approach in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the grading then is given by the standard conley - zehnder index @xcite and the trajectories of the negative gradient flow of @xmath26 connect critical points of _ increasing _ nonpositive indices .",
    "that is why the cohomology notation is used .",
    "it is known that the hamiltonian flow on @xmath5 generated by @xmath11 gives rise to geodesics of @xmath27 when projected to the base @xmath3 . in this way",
    "@xmath12 corresponds precisely to the set of closed geodesics of @xmath27 , which are the critical points of the classical action functional on the free loop space of @xmath3 ( called energy functional in riemannian geometry ) @xmath28 as the critical points of the symplectic and the classical action are naturally identified we denote them simply by @xmath29 .",

    "the resulting homology groups @xmath32 turn out to be isomorphic to @xmath33 as well as to the @xmath34 singular integral homology groups of @xmath35 which we compute using classical morse theory @xcite .",
    "recently viterbo @xcite as well as salamon and the present author @xcite , @xcite proved that singular homology of the loop space of a compact oriented riemannian manifold is isomorphic to floer cohomology of its cotangent bundle , hence the homology groups calculated in appendix [ se : perturbations ] do in fact not depend on the metric or the potential .",
    "the former proof uses generating function homology , whereas in the second proof one defines integral morse homology of the classical action functional , which is isomorphic to singular homology of the free loop space , and then constructs a natural isomorphism to integral floer homology of the cotangent bundle by showing a 1 - 1 correspondence of flow trajectories .",
    "one consequence of the perturbation of @xmath11 by the time dependent potential @xmath24 is that the critical points of @xmath36 can not be interpreted as closed geodesics any more .",
