    "in practical implementations of the kohn - sham density functional theory @xcite the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy is usually described by a suitable explicit functional of the electron density and the parameters characterizing the density inhomogeneity . a very promising step to improve the accuracy of density functional calculations relies on the use of orbital - dependent density functionals , in which the xc energy is expressed as an explicit functional of kohn - sham ( ks )",
    "orbitals @xcite . a rigorous approach to implement the orbital - dependent functionals within",
    "the ks formalism is the optimized effective potential ( oep ) method @xcite , where the xc potential is described by a local multiplicative term and the total energy functional is orbital - dependent . by virtue of the hohenberg - kohn theorems @xcite ,",
    "the oep solution is equivalent to the minimization of the total electronic energy with respect to the density @xcite . in the case of the exchange - only",
    " i.  e. , the hartree - fock ( hf )  energy functional , the corresponding oep method ( xoep ) was first formulated by sharp and horton @xcite and numerically solved in real space for atoms by talman and shadwick @xcite .",
    "applications of real space xoep formalism to atoms , molecules and solids , thanks to the use of pseudopotentials , have been reported in the literature . a number of approximations to the xoep method , such as the method of krieger - li - iafrate @xcite , the local hf @xcite and the effective local potential @xcite methods have been developed .",
    "the real space resolution of the xoep method has only been efficiently applied to highly - symmetric systems , such as spherically symmetric atoms and diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "application of the xoep formalism to polyatomic molecules requires its formulation in terms of basis sets suitable for molecular calculations .",
    "currently , there exist several formulations of the xoep method in terms of basis sets of local gaussian - type ( gto ) functions @xcite",
    ". the most popular implementation of the xoep formalism employs two different basis sets , one for the expansion of the ks orbitals and another one for representing the local multiplicative potential @xcite . within this approach",
    ", a special care must be taken when selecting the auxiliary basis set for the potential , thus leading to the concept of a balanced basis set firmly connected to the orbital basis set @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a set of the products of the occupied and virtual ks orbitals can be employed for the solution of the xoep equations for the local potential @xcite .",
    "the computational complexity of the xoep method in a basis set representation depends critically on the size of the orbital expansion basis set . for obtaining faithful solutions of the xoep equations , the orbital basis set should support the linear dependence in the space of the occupied - virtual orbital products @xcite . with the use of gto basis functions",
    ", this requirement leads to very large orbital basis sets with hundreds of basis functions even for small molecules .",
    "on the other hand , the use of slater - type ( sto ) basis functions give considerably more compact orbital basis sets which can be beneficial for the application of the xoep formalism , and a very efficient implementation of quantum chemical formalisms with slater - type basis functions has been achieved in the smiles suite of programs @xcite .",
    "it is the primary purpose of the present work to implement the xoep method within the smiles package and to analyze the advantages which can be obtained from the use of the sto basis sets , testing it for a small number of atoms and diatomic molecules , for which both numerical solutions @xcite and stos are available @xcite . in this work",
    "we employ the xoep algorithm outlined in refs .  [ ] and [ ] and the xoep equations , formulated in terms of the stos .",
    "the solution of the xoep equation will be carried out through the truncated singular value decomposition ( tsvd ) technique .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the use of the slater - type basis sets leads to considerable computational savings in every step of the selfconsistent procedure , without deteriorating the accuracy of the calculated xoep total and orbital energies .",

    "our expansion basis set will be a scaled form of the occupied - virtual products , specifically @xcite @xmath37 thus , the elements of the vector @xmath35 are @xmath38 and the matrix elements @xmath39 reduce to @xmath40    note that with the basis set of occupied - virtual products it is not possible to get any term having a @xmath41 asymptotic decay .",
    "this is corrected by the addition to our basis set @xmath42 of the fermi - amaldi function @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of electrons of the system .",
    "that procedure reproduces the fermi - amaldi potential for long distances and will make the xoep homo eigenenergies to be very close , but not equal , to those found using the hf method .",
    "this prescription @xcite is very different to the one adopted when the exchange potential is expanded in an auxiliary basis set @xcite .",

    "but as the stos represent the unoccupied orbitals in a much more efficient way than the gtos , when slater - type orbital basis sets are used the size of the matrix @xmath45 , and consequently the expansion space for the local potential in eq .",
    "( [ vxspan ] ) , is much smaller than when using gtos .",
    "this is the main point of this paper : when sto basis sets are used , the computational effort ( in memory size and in speed of the calculations ) for each self - consistent cycle is much lower , whereas the quality of the results is preserved .",
    "the algorithm outlined in the previous section was implemented in the smiles suite of programs @xcite , which employs the sto basis sets in quantum chemical calculations .",
    "we will compare the results of the xoep calculations obtained with the slater - type basis functions ( xoep - sto ) to both numerical exact solutions and xoep results obtained with the use of the gaussian - type basis functions ( xoep - gto ) .",

    "the correlation - consistent basis sets of dunning ( cc - pvtz , cc - pvqz , and cc - pv5z ) were used in the xoep - gto calculations , and the sto of similar quality ( vb1 for cc - pvtz , vb2 for cc - pvqz and vb3 for cc - pv5z ) @xcite were selected for the xoep - sto calculations .",
    "these sto and gto basis sets yield the total hf energies in close agreement ( see tables  [ totalbe ]  [ totalco ] below ) .",
    "all the basis sets we have used ( xoep - sto and xoep - gto calculations ) were employed in their uncontracted form .    due to the few exact numerical xoep solutions found in the literature , and to the small number of available stos for atomic and molecular computations , the calculations we present here were performed for the be and ne atoms and for the lih , bh , li@xmath48 and co molecules .",

    "@xcite in the xoep - gto solution , and we will also compare our results with theirs in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the dependence of the xoep - sto and the xoep - gto total energies on the size of the basis set and on the tsvd cutoff criterion @xmath53 for neglecting ( near ) zero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath45 has been investigated .",
    "the results are collected in tables [ totalbe ] , [ totallih ] and [ totalco ] . in the calculations , the tsvd cutoff criterion @xmath53 was varied in the range @xmath54 .",
    "note that when @xmath55 is employed , the expansion space for the potential is very small because only a few eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath45 are greater than @xmath53 , yielding energies noticeably above the numeric xoep values .",
    "for that reason , we have not reported that energies in the tables .",
    "reducing the tsvd cutoff @xmath53 makes the expansion space bigger and , as a consequence , the total xoep - sto and xoep - gto energies decrease , approaching to the accurate numeric xoep values . for @xmath53 in the range @xmath56 ,",
    "the total xoep energies remain constant to within a fraction of mha .",
    "when the xoep - gto method is used with a very tight cutoff criteria ( @xmath57 ) , the iterative solution of the xoep equation ( [ nablaoep ] ) becomes unstable and the xoep total energy collapses towards the hf energy . as a matter of fact , the procedure breaks - down as the matrix @xmath45 becomes noninvertible .",
    "on the other hand , the xoep - sto implementation shows somewhat greater stability and begins to break down at smaller values of @xmath53 , i.  e. when @xmath58 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that , with the use of sto functions , the expansion set of the potential is much smaller than with the more traditional gaussian - basis sets ( see below ) .",
    "the number of the eigenfunctions of the matrix @xmath45 used for the expansion of the potential is also given in tables [ totalbe ] , [ totallih ] and [ totalco ] , as well as the total dimension of the matrix .",
    "it is seen that the dimension of @xmath45 is considerably smaller in the xoep - sto method , and the dimension of the potential expansion space does not grow as fast as in the case of the xoep - gto method .",
    "so , the xoep - sto implementation gives a noticeably memory savings and a greater stability with respect to the cutoff criterion of the tsvd procedure .",
    "for all the systems in tables [ totalbe ] , [ totallih ] and [ totalco ] , the differences between the xoep - sto and the xoep - gto total energies are typically smaller than 1 mha .",
    "when large basis sets are used the total xoep - sto and xoep - gto energies approach the exact numeric values with an accuracy better than 100 @xmath17 ha .",
    "it is important to stress here that the xoep and hf total energies converge in a somewhat different way to respect to the basis set size ( remember that the basis sets we use in this paper were nor developed neither optimized for the xoep calculations ) so the differences @xmath59 oscillate .",
    "table [ totalxoep ] summarizes the results of calculations for be and ne atoms and a number of diatomic molecules studied by makmal et al .",
    "@xcite using the real space xoep method . for the sake of comparison , the xoep energies obtained by heelmann et al .",
    "@xcite with the use of balanced auxiliary basis sets for the potential are also shown when available .",
    "note that the xoep - sto energies are typically in a somewhat better agreement with the numerical values than the xoep - gto energies obtained with similar basis set ( the sto basis sets give results about @xmath60 mha below the energies obtained by heelmann et al . ) .",
    "table [ orbitalxoep ] collects the energies of the occupied orbitals obtained with the use of the xoep - sto and xoep - gto methods for the be atoms and the lih and li@xmath48 molecules .",
    "there is a good agreement between the numerical values of these orbital energies and the energies obtained with the two xoep methods .",
    "furthermore , the orbital energies from the xoep - sto and from the xoep - gto calculations agree with each other to within a few mha .    besides the total and orbital xoep energies , we have also studied the energy decomposition into the kinetic , nuclear - electron attraction , electron - electron repulsion and the exchange energies .",

    "note that our xoep potentials do not present any unphysical wiggle as those found by staronerov et al .",
    "@xcite and have a good agreement with both the numerical calculation and the xoep - gto solution by hessellmann et al .",
    "@xcite with the use of auxiliary basis set .    in summary ,",
    "the previous results show that both xoep - sto and xoep - gto methods yield close results to the numerical exact ones for the total energies , the one - electron energies of the occupied orbitals and the xoep potentials .",
    "the implementation of the xoep formalism with slater - type basis functions has been developed .",
    "this procedure has been tested in a small group of closed shell atoms and diatomic molecules , for which both numerical xoep solutions and sto basis sets are available . when compared to the exact numerical solution of the xoep equations we have obtained very good results ; they are even a bit better than those given by the gaussian - type basis sets procedure . on the other hand , both xoep - sto and xoep - gto results obtained with the prescription proposed in refs .  [ ] and [ ] give energies about @xmath60 mha below those obtained for xoep - gto by heelmann et al .",
    ", and thus they are closer to the exact results @xcite .",
    "the new method leads to a considerably more compact expansion space for the xoep local multiplicative potential , yielding noticeable savings in the computational effort to be done in each one of the cycles of the self - consistent procedure .",
    "yet another advantage of using the slate - type basis sets is that , within the tsvd algorithm , fewer eigenvalues of the ( near ) singular matrix @xmath45 need to be employed , which leads to an increased numeric stability of the xoep - sto method as compared to the xoep - gto algorithm .    as a final remark",
    ", it is known that a more efficient xoep algorithm can be developed based on the use of the incomplete cholesky decomposition technique .",
    "the use of this technique would facilitate the application of the xoep - sto method to larger molecules .",
    "this implementation is currently in progress and will be reported elsewhere .    on the other hand , this work is a first step to develop a local potential formalism for both exchange and correlation . due to the smaller memory requirements of the sto scheme we have presented here , it can be used to study bigger molecules than those that can be solved with the standard gto approach .",
