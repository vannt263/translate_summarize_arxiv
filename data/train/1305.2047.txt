    "the discovery of the higgs boson at 125  gev and the measurements of its production and decay rates strongly support the picture of the weakly coupled higgs mechanism for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is then important to ( re)consider the origin of the higgs field and its potential .",
    "the fact that the higgs boson mass is much smaller than @xmath4 , where @xmath5  gev , tells us that , the dynamics behind electroweak symmetry breaking has a very good description in terms of the linear sigma model .    not only from its mass , constraints from flavor changing neutral current and @xmath6 violating processes suggests that the picture of the elementary higgs field continues to be valid up to much higher than @xmath7  tev energy scale .",
    "this may be indicating that the physics to reveal the origin of the higgs field ( which is possibly string theory ) is out of the reach of the lhc experiments .",
    "although the picture of the weakly coupled elementary higgs field may be valid up to a very high energy scale , it can be a different question what generates the higgs potential to drive the electroweak symmetry breaking , and what sets the scale of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath5  gev .",
    "for example , one can consider new particles or dynamics at a tev energy scale and the higgs field couples to it so that the higgs potential is generated .",
    "if the elementary higgs field is weakly coupled to the tev scale dynamics , the higgs field naturally obtains potential to explain @xmath5  gev , while the picture of the elementary higgs fields remains valid much above the tev energy scale .",
    "the coupling to the dynamical sector generically causes mixing between the elementary higgs and some ( composite ) operators in the dynamics , making the observed higgs boson a partially composite particle .",
    "the picture that the higgs field is weakly coupled to a tev dynamics is particularly motivated in supersymmetric models where the simplest model , the mssm , predicts the higgs boson to be lighter than the @xmath3 boson at tree level .",
    "the partial compositeness explains why the higgs boson is heavy while the new dynamics can possibly provide a mechanism to address the naturalness problem in supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for earlier proposals of tev scale supersymmetric dynamics with elementary higgs fields . for more ambitious proposals to break supersymmetry by the same dynamics , see refs .  @xcite . in these works",
    ", it has been assumed that the dynamics rather than the higgs vev is the main source for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "although such a situation is now severely constrained by the electroweak precision tests , the framework is still an attractive possibility by focusing on a different region of the parameter space where the higgs vev is the main contribution to the @xmath2 boson mass . for proposals and studies of non - supersymmetric models ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in the tev dynamics",
    "we consider , there should be higgs - like operators which can couple to the elementary higgs field .",
    "this indicates that the dynamical sector has su(2)@xmath8u(1)@xmath9 as a part of the global symmetry just as in qcd .",
    "we , therefore , expect that there are resonances , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which couple to the su(2)@xmath8u(1)@xmath9 current , such as the @xmath10 meson in qcd . without specifying the actual dynamics",
    ", one can construct an effective theory of vector resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the gauge bosons of spontaneous broken gauge theory analogous to the hidden local symmetry  @xcite in qcd . in the partially composite higgs framework",
    ", we expect that the vector resonances appear at a tev energy scale , which is within the reach of the lhc experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we construct an effective theory of the @xmath11 sector which couples to the standard model higgs boson .",
    "the higgs operators which give masses to @xmath11 can mix with the standard model higgs boson , and triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we first examine the constraints from the electroweak precision tests , and see which region of the parameter space is allowed .",
    "we then reinterpret the results of the searches for @xmath11 in the sequential standard model at the lhc to the constraints on @xmath11 in the model .",
    "we see that the lhc experiments give stronger constraints than the precision tests in some parameter regions .",
    "the properties of the higgs boson are modified by the partial compositeness .",
    "we examine whether such modification is allowed by the present data .",
    "for example , we find that there are parameter regions where the strong sector components of the higgs boson is as large as @xmath12 .",
    "our work is closely related to ref .",
    "@xcite where phenomenology of the models with @xmath11 is studied motivated by the framework of the higgs boson as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite . there",
    ", a scalar particle is added to the non - linear sigma models of @xmath11 and discuss the constraints from the electroweak precision measurements and from the lhc data .",
    "we , on the other hand , construct a linear sigma model to describe @xmath11 resonances and couple the higgs field to it .",
    "compared to the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not need to assume relations among parameters motivated by the restoration of the perturbative unitarity , and all the physical quantities are , in principle , calculable . in the linear sigma model",
    ", we find that there is an important parameter , @xmath13 , which describes the parity violation in the dynamical sector .",
    "we see that the constraints from the precision measurements prefer a large parity violation , and in such parameter regions , the searches for @xmath11 at the lhc experiments become more important .",
    "we construct a model to describe the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons as the gauge bosons of new su(2 ) gauge interactions .",
    "the full gauge symmetry is , therefore , su(3)@xmath14su(2)@xmath15su(2)@xmath16u(1)@xmath17 , where su(3 ) is qcd , and remaining parts are the electroweak sector .",
    "the su(2)@xmath18 gauge factor is the one which is analogous to the hls in qcd , and thus we assume its gauge coupling is much larger than those of su(2)@xmath19 and u(1)@xmath17 .",
    "we also assume that all the quarks and leptons are elementary .",
    "they do not carry su(2)@xmath20 charges although they eventually couples to @xmath0/@xmath1 through mixing .",
    "the left - handed fermions are fundamental representation of su(2)@xmath19 , and the right - handed fermions are singlet .",
    "all the fermions have appropriate u(1)@xmath17 charges to reproduce the electric charges .",
    "three higgs fields , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , are introduced for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 break su(2)@xmath23su(2)@xmath20 , su(2)@xmath24u(1)@xmath17 , and su(2)@xmath25u(1)@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields represent the condensations in the dynamical sector .",
    "their vevs give masses to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath22 is the elementary higgs boson in the standard model . through the higgs potential , the standard model higgs field @xmath22 mixes with `` hadrons , '' ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) in the dynamical sector , and",

    "this is the minimal model for the partially composite higgs boson .",

    "the existence of the charged and cp - odd scalar bosons are distinctive feature of our model compared to other su(2 ) models .    the models without @xmath22 are strongly constrained from the @xmath30/@xmath31 parameters .",
    "it has been observed that such constraints get significantly weaker when the sm fermions are charged under su(2)@xmath20 , _ i.e. _ , where sm fermions are composite  @xcite .",
    "such models , if they exist , are subject to the constraints from searches for fcnc / cp non - conservations . in this paper , we take a more conservative approach that the sm fermions are all elementary and there is a fundamental higgs field which give masses to fermions through the yukawa intereactions , so that the well - tested ckm theory is not modified",
