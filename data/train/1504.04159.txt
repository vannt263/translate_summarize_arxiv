    "the energy spectrum of cosmic rays extends by more than 10 orders of magnitude from below 1 gev to more than 10@xmath5 ev .",
    "the energy spectrum follows a power law as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is around 3.0 in the whole energy range .",
    "it is so steep that direct measurements are not feasible above 100 tev . at higher energies ,",
    "the properties of the primary cosmic ray are determined indirectly from the measurement of the extensive air shower ( eas ) it produces after colliding with molecules of the atmosphere .",
    "the highest energy eass have been traditionally studied using two different techniques .",
    "the first one is based on telescopes that collect the fluorescence light emitted by atmospheric nitrogen molecules excited by secondary particles of the eas ( e.g. , fly s eye , hires ) .",
    "this allows to determine the longitudinal profile of the shower and it is considered to be close to a calorimetric measurement of the uhecr primary energy . however , fluorescence light can only be observed during moonless nights and , consequently , this technique can only be applied to @xmath8 of the incoming events @xcite .",
    "the second technique involves an array of detectors located at ground level , mainly scintillators ( e.g. , volcano ranch , agasa , kascade ) or water cherenkov tanks ( e.g. , haverah park ) , whose duty cycle is close to @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the lateral distribution of secondary particles at ground level can be inferred from the discrete sampling of the shower front .",
    "the lateral distribution is fitted assuming an appropriate parametrization ( called the lateral distribution function , ldf ) .",
    "the interpolated signal at a certain optimum distance , @xmath0 , is used as the energy estimator , which can be related to the primary energy thorough , for instance , monte carlo ( mc ) parametrizations .",
    "the optimum distance , @xmath10 , is traditionally fixed for each detector since it is assumed to be only dependent on the array spacing and geometry @xcite , although some studies suggest the convenience of calculating the optimum distance for each individual shower taking into account its primary energy and direction @xcite .    the current experiments , on the other hand , use hybrid techniques for @xmath0 calibration .",
    "the pierre auger observatory @xcite , taking data since 2004 , pioneers the simultaneous use of water cherenkov detectors and fluorescence telescopes , while the telescope array observatory @xcite , operating since 2008 , combines scintillators and telescopes .",
    "events detected simultaneously by both the surface and fluorescence detectors are called _",
    "hybrid_. hybrid events allow the calibration of @xmath0 with primary cosmic ray energy @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy of each event detected by the surface detector alone can be determined almost independently of mc simulations .",
    "systematic errors in energy estimate are greatly reduced in this way @xcite .",
    "these calibrations assume that the primaries are nuclei and , therefore , they can not be directly applied to photon - initiated showers .",
    "in addition , no photon event has been unambiguously identified up to now by any experiment so a proper calibration for photons is not possible with this technique .",
    "therefore , each experiment relies on mc simulations to infer the primary energy of photon events @xcite .    the method used for photon searches by auger in ref .",
    "@xcite was first proposed in ref .",
    "this method takes into account the well - known universality of the electromagnetic component of eas @xcite and the small muon fraction of the photon - initiated showers .",
    "the calibration curve , that is obtained from mc simulations , relates @xmath0 , the zenith angle of the incoming shower , @xmath11 , and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the primary energy of photon primaries can be determined with resolution of @xmath1220 - 25@xmath2 @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show how to modify that method to be applicable to hadron - initiated showers where the muon component is significant , especially , in case of water cherenkov arrays which enhanced their contribution to the total measured signal .",
    "the additional advantage is that the same method could be used to infer the primary energy for both , photon and hadron showers .",
    "moreover , in case of hadron - initiated showers the method can be calibrated with hybrid events reducing the systematic uncertainties coming from the high energy hadronic models used for shower simulations .",
    "the simulation of the atmospheric showers is performed with the aires monte carlo program ( version 2.8.4a ) @xcite using qgsjet - ii-03 @xcite as the hadronic interaction model .",
    "the input primary energy goes from @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 to @xmath16 in @xmath17 steps .",
    "approximately @xmath18 events have been simulated per energy bin for both , proton and iron primaries .",
    "the zenith angle has been selected following a sine - cosine distribution from @xmath19 to @xmath20 degrees , while the azimuth angle is uniformly distributed from @xmath19 to @xmath21 degrees .",

    "the values of @xmath44/_ndf _ are good if at least 3 stations are included in the fit , a minimum condition for shower reconstruction that is fulfilled for almost every event above the energy threshold of the detector .",
    "finally , the reconstructed @xmath26 is determined as the interpolated value from the fit at @xmath45 meters from the shower axis . in this method ,",
    "event by event fluctuations and reconstruction uncertainties are properly taken into account .",
    "the problem of saturation is common to all surface arrays , specially when dealing with high energy vertical showers .",
    "the consequent lack of detectors close to the core produces large uncertainties in the ldf fit and affects the reconstructed @xmath0 .",
    "the auger collaboration , for example , has developed sophisticated algorithms to estimate the signal of a saturated detector @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of such uncertainties and how to minimize them is beyond the scope of the present work so saturated events are discarded here .",
    "the simulation set has been divided into two samples . in each sample ,",
    "an equal number of proton and iron primaries have been mixed for each energy bin .",
    "the first sample represents the hybrid events and it is used to determine the calibration curves as it will be explained in the next sections .",
    "typical values for their reconstruction uncertainties are considered , so their real energy , zenith angle and @xmath1 are fluctuated with gaussian distributions whose standard deviations are 15@xmath2 @xcite , 1@xmath46 @xcite and 20 g/@xmath47 @xcite respectively .",
    "the second sample , which represents data from the surface detector alone , is used for reconstruction and only their reconstructed s(1000 ) and zenith angle are needed .",
    "thus , to simulate the reconstructed @xmath11 we have proceeded as previously for the calibration sample .",
    "note that the method proposed here is obviously also applicable to pure surface arrays but the calibration should be performed with mc simulations in this case as , in fact , always occurs in these type of experiments .",
    "the basic idea is that the dependence of @xmath0 with energy and zenith angle can be factorized as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is slightly less than 1 ( for example 0.95 in refs .",
    "@xmath50 takes into account the longitudinal evolution of the shower so it should be a decreasing function of @xmath11 and it depends on the slant depth of the shower @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the atmospheric depth at ground level .",
    "@xmath50 , as a function of @xmath53 , behaves similarly to the global profile of the shower .",
    "thus , as first approximation , @xmath50 is a function of @xmath54 with a similar shape to the gaisser - hillas function commonly used to describe the longitudinal profile .",
    "an empirical parametrization is given in ref .",
    "@xcite by , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are in g/@xmath47 , @xmath26 is in vem , the energy is in eev and @xmath59 is in vem / eev . in the case of photon showers ,",
    "whose muon contribution to the signal could be neglected and considering the universality of the electromagnetic component of eas , this function results nearly independent of the primary energy .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite a universal parametrization is found with @xmath60 vem / eev , @xmath61 g/@xmath47 and @xmath62 g/@xmath47 .    however , the profile does depend on the primary energy for hadron - initiated showers mainly due to the existence of a non - negligible muonic component in the showers , which is itself a function of the primary energy .",
    "moreover , in case of water cherenkov detectors the sensitivity to muons is enhanced . therefore , despite the fact that the shape of the calibration curve is dominated by the photon component of the signal , the muon component breaks the universality .",
    "in fact , if a unique function were applied to determine the primary energy of hadron - induced showers , it would result in an energy dependent bias , as it will be shown later in sec .",
    "[ sec : results : energyreconstruction ] .",
    "therefore , the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 should be allowed to change with the primary energy to correctly reproduce the profile of hadron showers .",
    "then , @xmath57 tends to be larger than 1000 g/@xmath47 , usually fluctuating around 3000 g/@xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the function is very slightly modified if @xmath57 is larger than 1000 g/@xmath47 ( the numerator is very close to unity ) , so we have decided to fix @xmath57 = 3000 g/@xmath47 .",
    "then , @xmath59 is the maximum of the function and decreases as energy increases .",

    "a reconstructed energy is obtained , but as explained before , the non - universality of ( a ) for hadron primaries introduce a significant bias that must be corrected .    1 .",

    "[ sec : results : energyreconstruction ] .    in a real experiment ,",
    "the events with a large error in the reconstructed zenith angle should be analyzed carefully or even rejected since the process could not converge .",
    "in fact , they are mostly saturated events with energy very close to the threshold of the detector , or events with cores very close to the border of the array or to a detector that is not working , so they are in general already rejected by the quality cuts usually imposed for data analysis .",
    "independent sets of calibration curves can be , and indeed were , obtained for each primary .",

    "gaussian errors , for example , are easier to handle and understand when applying deconvolution techniques for determination of the spectrum while assuring that there are no asymmetries or long tails , which further reduces the danger of the limited energy range of the detector and biases associated with a rapidly changing spectral index .",

    "<S> the current methods to determine the primary energy of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are different when dealing with hadron or photon primaries . </S>",
    "<S> the current experiments combine two different techniques , an array of surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> the latter allow an almost calorimetric measurement of the primary energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , hadron - initiated showers detected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator from the surface array ( usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance from the shower core @xmath0 ) with the primary energy . on the other hand , this calibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high energy photon has been unambiguously detected so far . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , pure monte carlo parametrizations are used instead .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new method to determine the primary energy of hadron - induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously developed for photon primaries . </S>",
    "<S> it consists on a set of calibration curves that relate the surface energy estimator , @xmath0 , and the depth of maximum development of the shower , @xmath1 , obtained from the fluorescence telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> then , the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since @xmath0 and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed . considering a mixed sample of ultra - high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into account the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic uncertainty below 1@xmath2 and resolution around 16@xmath2 in the energy range from 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 ev . </S>",
    "<S> several array geometries , the shape of the energy error distributions and the uncertainties due to the unknown composition of the primary flux have been analyzed as well .    </S>",
    "<S> ultra - high energy cosmic rays , hybrid experiments , energy reconstruction </S>"
