    "interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity is the focus of recent studies in different branches of modern applied mathematics and nonlinear physics .",
    "applications range from nonlinear optics , in the dynamics of guided waves in inhomogeneous optical structures and photonic crystal lattices , to atomic physics , in the dynamics of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) droplets in periodic potentials , and from condensed matter , in josephson - junction ladders , to biophysics , in various models of the dna double strand . analysis and modeling of these physical situations",
    "are based on nonlinear evolution equations derived from underlying physics equations , such as nonlinear maxwell equations with periodic coefficients  @xcite . in particular , the systems of 2nd - order nls equations , both continuous and discrete , were applied in nonlinear physics to study a number of experimental and theoretical problems .",
    "spatial non - locality of the nonlinear response is also naturally present in the description of becs where it represents the finite range of the bosonic interaction .",
    "demands on the mathematics for techniques to analyze these models may best be served by developing methods tailored to determining the local behavior of solutions near these structures .",
    "the discreteness of space i.e. , the existence of an underlying spatial lattice is crucial to the structural stability of these spatially localized nonlinear excitations .    during the early years",
    ", studies of intrinsic localized modes were mostly of a mathematical nature , but the ideas of localized modes soon spread to theoretical models of many different physical systems , and the discrete breather concept has been recently applied to experiments in several different physics subdisciplines .",
    "most nonlinear lattice systems are not integrable even if the partial differential equation ( pde ) model in the continuum limit is .",
    "while for many years spatially continuous nonlinear pde s and their localized solutions have received a great deal of attention , there has been increasing interest in spatially discrete nonlinear systems .",
    "namely , the dynamical properties of nonlinear systems based on the interplay between discreteness , nonlinearity and dispersion ( or diffraction ) can find wide applications in various physical , biological and technological problems .",
    "examples are coupled optical fibres ( self - trapping of light )  @xcite , arrays of coupled josephson junctions  @xcite , nonlinear charge and excitation transport in biological macromolecules , charge transport in organic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "prototype models for such nonlinear lattices take the form of various nonlinear lattices @xcite , a particularly important class of solutions of which are so called discrete breathers which are homoclinic in space and oscillatory in time .",
    "other questions involve the existence and propagation of topological defects or kinks which mathematically are heteroclinic connections between a ground and an excited steady state .",
    "prototype models here are discrete version of sine - gordon equations , also known as frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) models , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there are many outstanding issues for such systems relating to the global existence and dynamics of localized modes for general nonlinearities , away from either continuum or anti - continuum limits .    in the main part of the previous studies of the discrete nls models the dispersive interaction was assumed to be short - ranged and a nearest - neighbor approximation was used .",
    "however , there exist physical situations that definitely can not be described in the framework of this approximation .",
    "the dna molecule contains charged groups , with long - range coulomb interaction @xmath0 between them .",
    "the excitation transfer in molecular crystals @xcite and the vibron energy transport in biopolymers @xcite are due to transition dipole - dipole interaction with @xmath1 dependence on the distance , @xmath2 . the nonlocal ( long - range )",
    "dispersive interaction in these systems provides the existence of additional length - scale : the radius of the dispersive interaction .",
    "we will show that it leads to the bifurcating properties of the system due to both the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion , and the interplay of long - range interactions and lattice discreteness .    in some approximation the equation of motion",
    "is the nonlocal discrete nls @xmath3 where the long - range dispersive coupling is taken to be either exponentially @xmath4 with @xmath5 , or algebraically @xmath6 with @xmath7 , decreasing with the distance @xmath8 between lattice sites . in both cases",
    "the constant @xmath9 is normalized such that @xmath10 , for all @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are introduced to cover different physical situations from the nearest - neighbor approximation @xmath13 to the quadrupole - quadrupole @xmath14 and dipole - dipole @xmath15 interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 and the number of excitations @xmath17 @xmath18 are conserved quantities corresponding to the set of ( [ e0a ] ) .    it should be also noted that the derivation of a discrete equation from the gross - pitaevskii equation produces at the intermediate step a fully nonlocal discrete nls equation for the coefficients of the wave function expansion over the complete set of the wannier functions .",
    "further reduction to the case of the only band with the strong localization of the wannier functions ( the tight - binding approximation ) leads to the standard local dnls equation .",
