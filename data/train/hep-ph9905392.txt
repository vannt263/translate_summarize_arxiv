    "the production process of one neutral pion by two virtual photons , @xmath8 , plays a crucial role in the studies of exclusive processes in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "being one of the simplest exclusive processes , it involves only one hadron and relates directly to the pion distribution amplitude @xcite . at large photon virtualities",
    ", we can calculate the form factor using perturbative qcd and obtain important information on the shape of the pion distribution amplitude from the experimental data .",
    "in general , the pion distribution amplitudes serve as input in the qcd sum rule method and allow the calculation of many form factors ( for example heavy - to - light form factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and hadronic coupling constants ( for example @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to reviews @xcite and recent studies @xcite .",
    "recently , the cleo collaboration has measured the @xmath5 form factor . in this experiment ,",
    "one of the photons is nearly on - shell and the other one is highly off - shell , with a virtuality in the range @xmath13 gev@xmath14 - @xmath15 gev@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we study the possibility of extracting the twist-2 pion distribution amplitude from the cleo data .",
    "the pion - photon transition has been the subject of many studies in framework perturbative qcd @xcite , lattice calculations @xcite and qcd sum rule method @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we use the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) method for calculating the form factor of the process @xmath5 .",
    "the method of lcsr has been suggested in @xcite and consists of the operator product expansion ( ope ) on the light - cone @xcite combined with the qcd sum rule technique @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to calculate this form factor by using the lcsr method has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the twist-2 and twist-4 contributions were calculated to leading order without accounting for perturbative qcd effects .",
    "the radiative qcd effects are usually large ( @xmath16 ) and allow to fix the normalization scale dependence of involved parameters .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the lcsr for the form factor @xmath5 at next - to - leading order in @xmath17 ( nlo ) .",
    "we derive @xmath18 radiative corrections to the spectral density of the twist-2 operator .",
    "we combine the twist-2 contribution at nlo with higher twist contributions ( twist-4 ) in order to analyze the lcsr for the form factor of the process @xmath5 numerically .    using cleo experimental data",
    ", we extract the parameters of the twist-2 distribution amplitude .",
    "the distribution amplitude appears to be very close to the asymptotic distribution amplitude .",
    "the deviation of the distribution amplitude from the asymptotic one is small and is estimated to be @xmath19 using pion distribution amplitude with one non - asymptotic term .",
    "this result on @xmath3 agrees well with recent analysis on electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite .",
    "the pion distribution amplitude with two non - asymptotic terms is also extracted , giving some region in the @xmath20-plane .",
    "theoretical systematical uncertainties are dominant over experimental statistical ones and systematical uncertainties are strongly correlated , defining the allowed parameter space of @xmath21 .",
    "the extracted region for the distribution amplitude is in qualitative agreement with results derived in @xcite , where it has been claimed that the pion distribution amplitude is very close to the asymptotic form .",
    "however , our region does not overlap with the pion distribution amplitudes suggested in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the general framework of calculating the @xmath22 form factor with lcsr . in section 3",
    "we calculate a spectral density at lo and nlo and present the final sum rule at nlo . in section 4",
    "we perform a numerical analysis and discuss a procedure to extract the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 including the estimation of the systematic and statistical uncertainties .",
    "we start with the correlator of two vector currents @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the momenta of the photons .",
    "if both virtualities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are large and euclidean , @xmath30 , the correlator can be expanded near the light - cone ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the leading twist-2 contribution to the correlator ( [ correlator ] ) is @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the pion distribution amplitude of twist-2 defined through @xmath34 in principle , the higher twist contributions can be calculated using the ope on the light cone .",
    "however , in the cleo experimental data , one of the virtualities is small , i.e. @xmath35 . a straightforward ope calculation is not possible and we have to use analyticity and duality arguments .    since the form factor @xmath36 is an analytical function in both variables , we can write the form factor as a dispersion relation in @xmath37 : @xmath38 the physical ground states are @xmath39 and @xmath40 vector mesons .",
    "we use the zero - width approximation and define the matrix elements of electromagnetic currents , assuming isospin symmetry : @xmath41 ; @xmath42 ; @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the polarization vector of the @xmath39 meson ; @xmath45 is its decay constant .",
    "the spectral density of higher energy states @xmath46 is derived from the qcd - calculated expression for @xmath47 by using usual semi - local quark - hadron duality for @xmath48 @xmath49    we equate the dispersion relation ( [ e : hr ] ) with the qcd expression at large @xmath37 . using the dispersion relation for the qcd function @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath51 the next step is to perform a borel transformation in @xmath37 .",
    "we finally get the lcsr for the form factor @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a borel parameter .    substituting ( [ e : rho ] ) and the duality approximation ( [ e : duality ] ) into ( [ e : hr ] ) and taking the @xmath35 limit we obtain the sum rule for the form factor @xmath55 @xcite : @xmath56 we will use this expression as our basic sum rule for the numerical analysis .",
    "the next step is to calculate the spectral density at lo and nlo .",
    "calculating twist-2 contributions to @xmath36 , only one distribution amplitude enters , the pion distribution amplitude , @xmath57 , defined by ( [ pionme ] ) . as a result",
    ", the @xmath36 can be written as the convolution of the hard amplitude @xmath58 and the distribution amplitude @xmath57 : @xmath59 the hard amplitude ",
    "it plays the role of the wilson coefficient in ope  is calculable within perturbative theory , the pion distribution amplitude @xmath57 contains the long - distance effects .    the theoretical spectral density at @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be calculated from @xmath62    the contribution of twist-2 at lo approximation ( [ tw2as ] ) @xcite is @xmath63 where @xmath64    the @xmath65 correlation function for @xmath66 was considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "we use this result and present it in a form which is useful for our further calculations ( @xmath67 ) : @xmath68 @xmath69 the coefficients @xmath70 are expanded in terms of @xmath71 : @xmath72 the coefficients are : @xmath73 with @xmath74    now we take the imaginary part of this expression in the energy region @xmath61 and @xmath75 . the nontrivial imaginary part comes from the functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "it is worth to note that this energy region gives the same values for @xmath3 , @xmath4 as the overall sample of data . ] , since the form factor @xmath137 does not appear in the final sum rule .",
    "the duality assumption introduces another source of uncertainties which is difficult to estimate .",
    "we assume that the variation of @xmath141 and @xmath115 gives us a rough idea about the size .    to fix statistical uncertainties we apply the fit procedure on a statistical set of data tables , where the experimental points are randomly displaced within the given errors @xcite .",
    "our results are presented in fig .",
    "[ f : syserr ] , where we show a parameter space of the twist-2 distribution amplitude , which is obtained by comparing cleo results with our sum rule . besides of statistical uncertainties",
    ", we account for the possible theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we combine theoretical uncertainties together and write the theoretical form factor as ( with 95% cl ) : @xmath142 the @xmath143 denote the asymptotic contribution of twist-2/twist-4 distribution amplitudes , @xmath144 are the normalized contributions of the higher gegenbauer polynomials .    the width of the allowed region ( fig .",
    "[ f : syserr ] ) is due to experimental - statistical uncertainties , whereas the length is due to theoretical - systematical ones .    as we see form fig .",
    "[ f : syserr ] , theoretical - systematical uncertainties are dominant over experimental statistical ones , giving a correlation between the parameters @xmath145 .",
    "[ f : syserr2 ] shows a more conservative scenario where we assume an uncertainty of @xmath146 in the twist-2 term and again @xmath147 for the twist-4 contribution .",
    "it is worth to mentioned that the allowed space of @xmath3 and @xmath4 does not overlap with braun - filyanov and chernyak - zhitnitsky distribution amplitudes @xcite .",
    "these distribution amplitudes are beyond the @xmath148 cl level region of the allowed parameter space for @xmath3 , @xmath4 . at the same time our region for @xmath20 is consistent with results presented in @xcite , where it has been claimed that the pion distribution amplitude is very close to the asymptotic form .",
    "the region presented in fig .",
    "[ f : syserr2 ] does not favor any central value .",
    "but in order to quantify the region , we may roughly identify following values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath149    we also observe that @xmath0 form factor is more sensitive to the sum of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , than to the @xmath150 .",
    "really , we found that only one linear combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is determined well , it is @xmath151 .",
    "it would be very useful to study some observable , which is sensitive to @xmath152 , for example , the coupling constant @xmath153 .",
    "lcsr for this coupling is related to @xmath154 , which is sensitive to the combination @xmath152 .",
    "in general , the result for the model with one non - asymptotic term ( [ result ] ) is very reliable . at the same time , we have very useful constraint on the model with two non - asymptotic terms .",
    "although , an additional constraint on @xmath152 would be extremely useful .",
    "we have studied the pion form factor @xmath0 in the light - cone sum rule approach , including radiative corrections and higher twist effects . comparing the results to the cleo experimental data on @xmath0",
