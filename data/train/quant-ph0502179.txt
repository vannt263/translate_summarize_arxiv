    "data sealing is a cryptographic problem between two parties . a sender ( alice )",
    "stores some secret data in a certain form , so that any other reader ( bob ) can read it without alice s helping .",
    "meanwhile , if the data has been read , it should be detectable by alice@xcite .",
    "a common example of classical data sealing is closing a letter in an envelop with a wafer of molten wax , into which was pressed the distinctive seal of the sender .    like all other classical cryptographic protocols , it is interesting to find the quantum version of data sealing for better security .",
    "bechmann - pasquinucci @xcite first proposed a protocol which seals a classical bit with a three - qubit state .",
    "singh and srikanth@xcite extended the idea into a many - qubit majority voting scheme , and associated it with secret sharing to improve the security .",
    "chau@xcite presented a protocol which seals quantum data with quantum error correcting code .",
    "the protocol for sealing a classical string was also proposed@xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out by the author himself , the protocol in ref.@xcite is insecure against collective measurements .",
    "more general , it was further proven@xcite that perfect quantum sealing of a classical bit is impossible in principle .",
    "if a protocol allows the bit to be perfectly retrievable by the reader , then collective measurements exist which can read the bit without disturbing the corresponding quantum state .",
    "it means that bob can always read the bit without being detected by alice .",
    "in fact , the protocol for sealing quantum data can not be used for sealing a classical bit either .",
    "this is because the quantum states used for encoding the bits @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively are orthogonal to each other .",
    "they can be distinguished by collective measurements without any disturbance too .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether imperfect quantum sealing of a classical bit is possible . here",
    "`` imperfect '' means that the sealed bit @xmath6 is not perfectly retrievable in the protocol .",
    "bob can only read @xmath6 correctly with the probability @xmath7 , while reading @xmath6 can be detected with the probability @xmath1 .",
    "obviously a protocol with @xmath8 is a perfect one .",
    "but if there exists a protocol in which both @xmath0and @xmath1  are less than but very close to @xmath5 , it is still very valuable for practical usage .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper it will be shown that upper bounds exist for @xmath9  and @xmath1 .",
    "if bob uses collective measurements instead of the honest operations to read @xmath6 , then the upper bounds are @xmath10  and @xmath3 .",
    "this result actually bounds the power of practical quantum sealing of a classical bit . in the next section",
    "we will establish a general model of imperfect quantum sealing protocols .",
    "basing on the model , the upper bounds will be obtained in section iii . in section",
    "iv some examples of imperfect protocols are studied .",
    "the impacts of the result will be discussed in the last section .",
    "first let us establish the model of imperfect quantum sealing protocols , on which the discussion in this paper is based .",
    "note that here and in the following content , when speaking of quantum sealing protocols , we means the protocols for sealing _ a classical bit _ only , except where noted .",
    "the details of the data sealing process is not important to our discussion , but the ending of the protocol generally has the following features :    \\(1 ) bob knows an operation @xmath11 ;    \\(2 ) bob owns a quantum system @xmath12 ( @xmath12  may not be in the eigenstate of @xmath11 .",
    "otherwise the protocol becomes a perfect one ) ;    \\(3 ) alice lets bob know two sets @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , such that if he applies @xmath11 on @xmath12  and the outcome is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , he should take the value of the sealed bit as @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ; while if @xmath20 , the sealed bit can not be identified , i.e. bob needs to guess @xmath21 randomly by himself .",
    "note that since @xmath12  may not be in the eigenstate of @xmath11 , the value of @xmath21 thus obtained will match alice s input @xmath6 with a probability @xmath0 only ;    \\(4 ) alice owns a quantum system @xmath22 entangled with @xmath12 . and",
    "she knows that the initial state of the system @xmath23 is @xmath24 ;    \\(5 ) at any time alice can access to the entire system @xmath23 and compare its state @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "thus she can detect whether @xmath6 has been read with the probability @xmath27 .",
    "note that in the protocols previously proposed ( e.g. refs.@xcite ) , alice does not own the system @xmath22 described above , and the case @xmath20 generally will not occur . but to make our result as general as possible so that it may cover other protocols potentially existed , we include these features in the model .",
    "obviously previous protocols are only the special cases  of the model where the entanglement between @xmath22 and @xmath12 has already collapsed before the end of the protocol , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 cover all possible outcomes of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29  be the global hilbert space constructed by all possible states of @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 denotes a basis of @xmath29 , which is the eigenvector set of the operation @xmath11 .",
    "it can be divided into three orthogonal subsets @xmath32 , @xmath33  and @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , applying @xmath11 on @xmath37  will lead to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ; and @xmath38  will lead to @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the equal probability @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath29 is consequently divided into three subspaces @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , whose eigenvector sets are @xmath43 , @xmath44and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "though the subspaces @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are orthogonal to each other , the quantum states used for encoding the bits @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively need not to be orthogonal in an imperfect quantum sealing protocol",
    ". instead , any state in @xmath29 could be the state of the system @xmath12 .",
    "that is , the state of @xmath12 may contain the vectors from different subspaces , so that the states used for encoding @xmath4 and @xmath5 may overlap . in this case , the cheating strategy in the impossibility proof of perfect quantum sealing can not be successful with the probability @xmath5 .",
    "however , note that @xmath32 , @xmath33  and @xmath34 form a complete basis of @xmath29",
    ". let @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) denotes the initial state of @xmath23 when alice want to seal @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "it can always be expanded as @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52  ( sum over all possible @xmath53 within each corresponding subspace ) , @xmath54 .",
    "all @xmath55  are the vectors describing the state of @xmath22 , which are not required to be orthogonal to each other .    with such initial states",
    ", it can be seen that the maximal probability for bob to read @xmath6 correctly ( i.e. his outcome @xmath21 matches alice s input @xmath6 ) is @xmath56/2 .",
    "\\label{alfa}\\ ] ]    consider a dishonest bob who does not use @xmath11 but the following strategy to read @xmath6 .",
    "define two operators @xmath57  ( sum over all possible @xmath58 within @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 ) , which are the collective measurements projecting the quantum state into the subspaces @xmath40 and @xmath61 respectively . bob randomly chooses to apply either @xmath62 or @xmath63 on @xmath12 with the equal probability @xmath39 .",
    "if his choice is @xmath64 and @xmath30 can be projected to the subspace @xmath59 successfully , he takes @xmath65 ; else if the projection fails , he always takes @xmath66 without further measurements on the quantum state .",
    "that is , he never makes further attempts to distinguish the state between the two subspaces @xmath67  and @xmath42 .",
    "it can be shown that with this strategy , bob can also reach the maximized @xmath0 in eq.([alfa ] ) .",
    "now let us calculate the probability @xmath1 for the reading to be detected by alice .",
    "there can be four different cases :    \\(1 ) _ bob s choice is _",
    "@xmath62 _ , and the initial state of _",
    "@xmath68 _ is _ @xmath69_. _ from eq.([psai ] ) it can be seen that @xmath12 can be projected into @xmath40  successfully with the probability @xmath70 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath23 collapses to @xmath71 .",
    "it can be viewed as the initial state with the probability @xmath72 .",
    "therefore alice can detect the disturbance of the state with the probability @xmath73    on the other hand , the projection can also fail with the probability @xmath74 , with @xmath23 collapsing to @xmath75 .",
    "it can be viewed as the initial state with the probability @xmath76 .",
    "therefore alice can detect the disturbance with the probability @xmath77    altogether , in this case reading @xmath6 can be detected by alice with the probability @xmath78 here the condition @xmath79 is used .",
    "\\(2 ) _ bob s choice is _",
    "@xmath62 _ , and the initial state of _",
    "@xmath68 _ is _",
    "@xmath80_. _ similar to the analysis above , in this case reading @xmath6 can be detected by alice with the probability @xmath81    \\(3 ) _ bob s choice is _",
    "@xmath63 _ , and the initial state is _",
    "@xmath82_. _ similar to eq.([case1 ] ) , the detecting probability is @xmath83    \\(4 ) _ bob s choice is _",
    "@xmath63 _ , and the initial state is _",
    "@xmath84_. _ similar to eq.([case2 ] ) , the detecting probability is @xmath85    in all , the average probability for alice to detect the reading is @xmath86/2 .",
    "\\label{beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right - hand side of this equation reaches its maximum when @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "thus the upper bound for @xmath1 is @xmath89    combining eqs.([alfa ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) , we have @xmath90/2 .",
    "\\label{sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right - hand side of this equation reaches its maximum when @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "thus we obtain another upper bound @xmath94",
    "here we give an example on how the above cheating strategy is applied to an embodied protocol .    in ref.@xcite",
    "a compound scheme was proposed , which embeds a majority voting quantum sealing scheme in a classical secret sharing scheme . as pointed out by the authors ,",
    "the entire scheme is secure since the secret sharing scheme prevents any single reader from possessing all the qubits to perform collective measurements . without the secret sharing scheme , as it will be shown below , the majority voting scheme alone",
    "is insecure .",
    "the majority voting scheme is defined as follows . to seal a classical bit @xmath6",
    ", alice prepares @xmath95 qubits .",
    "@xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) qubits called the code qubits are prepared in the state @xmath98 .",
    "the other @xmath99qubits called the seal qubits are put randomly in any eigenstate of the diagonal basis @xmath100 . to read the bit @xmath6 , an honest bob",
    "is supposed to measure each qubit in the computational basis @xmath101 .",
    "he takes @xmath102 ( or @xmath5 ) if more than @xmath103 qubits are found as @xmath104  ( or @xmath105 ) . since @xmath97",
    ", we can see that the states encoding @xmath4 and @xmath5 are nonorthogonal to each other .",
    "bob stands a nonzero probability of misreading the bit .",
    "therefore it is an imperfect sealing scheme .",
    "the cheating strategy to this scheme is exactly the one described in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath106 denote the weight ( the number of the bit @xmath5 ) of a classical binary @xmath95-bit string @xmath107 .",
    "the eigenvector set @xmath108  in the present case is the computational basis @xmath109 of the global hilbert space @xmath29 , where @xmath107runs through all possible classical @xmath95-bit strings .",
    "its three orthogonal subsets are defined as @xmath110 , @xmath111  and @xmath112 .",
    "the three subspaces @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are consequently defined by these subsets .    for simplicity",
    "let us consider the case where @xmath95 is odd so that @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114  be the state of the @xmath95-qubit system encoding @xmath6 .",
    "for any @xmath115 with @xmath96 code qubits , we can expand all the @xmath99 seal qubits in the computational basis .",
    "thus @xmath114 is expanded into @xmath116 items , of which @xmath117 items belong to @xmath118 , while the other @xmath119 items belong to @xmath120 .",
    "that is @xmath121 where any @xmath122  can only be @xmath123  or @xmath4 , with @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "for example , an @xmath126 , @xmath127 state @xmath128  sealing @xmath49 ( the first one in eq.(1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) can be expanded as @xmath129 where the first item on the right of the equation belongs to @xmath130 , while the other @xmath131 items belong to @xmath132 .",
    "obviously when @xmath114 is measured honestly , @xmath6 can be read correctly with the probability @xmath133    on the other hand , a dishonest bob can always use the operator @xmath134  ( sum over all @xmath107 satisfying @xmath135 ) to perform a collective measurement on @xmath114 .",
    "he takes @xmath102 whenever the projection is successful , else he takes @xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen that he can also read @xmath6 correctly with the above probability @xmath0 .",
    "the probability @xmath1  for the reading to be detected by alice can be calculated by repeating the analysis in the previous section . by comparing eq.([ex1 ] ) with eq.([psai ] ) , we find @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . substituting them into eq.([beta ] ) gives    @xmath139    eqs.([exalfa ] ) and ( [ exbeta ] ) clearly show that in the majority voting scheme , if alice wants to rise the readability @xmath0 , the probability @xmath1 for her to detect the reading will inevitably drop no matter how she chooses @xmath95 and @xmath140 . especially , @xmath141 when @xmath142 .",
    "this result as well as the value of @xmath143 as a function of @xmath0 are plotted in fig.1 .",
    "thus we see that without being associated with secret sharing , the majority voting scheme alone is insecure against the collective measurement .    the security of the majority voting scheme .",
    "@xmath0 is the probability for bob to read the bit successfully .",
    "@xmath1 is the probability for alice to detect the reading .",
    "the solid line represents @xmath144 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the dashed line represents @xmath143 as a function of @xmath0 . ]",
    "eq.([beta ] ) indicates that to reach the maximum @xmath146 , alice should seal the bit @xmath6 in the form @xmath147 but clearly such a protocol is useless , since the bit can only be read correctly with the probability @xmath148 .",
    "even random guess based on nothing at all can reach such a probability .",
    "eq.([sum ] ) indicates that to reach the maximum @xmath150 , alice should seal the bit @xmath6 in the form @xmath151 in this case @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "note that keeping the system @xmath154 ( whose state is described by @xmath155 ) at alice s side is important . otherwise , consider the simplified version @xmath156 it can not reach @xmath150 if bob knows that alice has prepared the states this way .",
    "this is because the cheating strategy in the previous section does not require bob to know the value of @xmath0 .",
    "if he does , he may have other optimal strategies to further reduce @xmath1 . in the present case , bob can fake the quantum state with a certain probability after reading it .",
    "for example , if he has applied @xmath62 on @xmath12  and the projection fails , he knows that the state has collapsed to @xmath157 .",
    "since he knows @xmath0 , he can use a unitary transformation to shift the state into @xmath158 ( @xmath159 is the dimensionality of @xmath40 ) .",
    "this generally increases his chance to survive through alice s detection .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath143 in this protocol will be further reduced .",
    "this is also true for the majority voting scheme discussed in the section iv.a .",
    "if bob knows @xmath140 he knows @xmath0 from eq.([exalfa ] ) , so that he can further reduce @xmath1 .",
    "but if there is a system @xmath22  at alice s side , it can not be faked by bob .",
    "then changing the state at his own side alone will be useless and the upperbound could be reached .",
    "the upper bounds @xmath160  and @xmath3 found in this paper can be seen as an extension of the impossibility proof of perfect quantum sealing of a classical bit@xcite .",
    "the latter can be seen as the special case where @xmath8 .",
    "eq.([alfa ] ) shows that @xmath8  means @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "substituting these values into eq.([beta ] ) immediately gives @xmath163 .    due to the existence of these upper bounds , quantum sealing seems to be far from practical usage , unless we can find a protocol that can not be covered by the model proposed in section ii .",
    "however , so far there still has no sign on the existence of such a protocol .",
    "luckily , as mentioned above , our model is limited to the protocols which seal a single classical bit .",
    "the protocol which seals a classical string@xcite is not covered and can be secure .",
    "very recently , the insecurity of quantum sealing was also studied by chau@xcite , in which a more detailed model of quantum sealing ( @xmath164 and bob knows @xmath0 ) was analyzed with a different approach .",
    "the result @xmath160  was also obtained , which consists with the finding in the present paper .",
    "99 in fact , in the original proposal of ref.@xcite , the detection was suggested to be performed by another verifier authorized by alice . for simplicity without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that the verifier can get as much information as he needs from alice , so that he can maximize the successful probability of the detection .",
    "therefore the verifier can be taken as alice herself ."
