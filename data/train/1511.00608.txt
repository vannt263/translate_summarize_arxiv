    "in general , the own definition of transport implies movement , variations in time . however , because solving time - dependent transport models entails a large computational burden @xcite , there are many examples of time - independent models that provide accurate predictions about transport phenomena .",
    "specifically , in quantum transport , a normal and extended approximation is to substitute the intrinsic time - dependence of the states involved in the computations by time - independent ones @xcite-@xcite . the success of such time - independent models to solve in a comfortable way many quantum transport phenomena is unquestionable .",
    "however , can we always remove the explicit time - dependence of transport models ? @xcite-@xcite the answer is not simple at all .",
    "+ in this paper , we analyze if such time - dependence of the states is relevant or not in a type of hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) experiment @xcite with tunneling and exchange .",
    "two identical electrons are injected simultaneously from two different inputs and after scattering on an electron beam splitter they are measured at two different outputs .",
    "the correlation between the detection of the two outputs is measured depending on the injection delay . from these correlation values",
    "one can directly obtain quantum noise , i.e. the fluctuations in the number of detected electrons .",
    "in particular , we focus on a situation quite close to the experiment mentioned above , but where the scattering region is a double barrier potential with an oscillatory quantum well in a 1d system , see .",
    "in particular , we focus on the case where there is no delay in the injection among both electrons .",
    "then , in principle it is expected that quantum noise is suppressed due to pauli principle , which states that two electrons can not be at the same place with the same state @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", it is expected that each electron will be located at a different output with no ( zero frequency ) fluctuations .",
    "however , our numerical results and the experiment in this type of hom system show that , even if quantum noise is reduced it is not completely suppressed , indicating the non - zero probability of detecting simultaneously two electrons at the same side .",
    "+ we have shown in a previous paper @xcite that , because of the localization of the initial states and the energy dependence of the scattering region , the probability of having two electrons at the same place is different from zero , even when the ( fermi or bose ) nature of particles is explicitly considered . in this paper",
    "we develop a novel expression of the quantum noise in this two - particle scattering process , which takes into account these unexpected probabilities .",
    "this expression gives a fundamental unavoidable reason for the quantum noise unexpected enhancement @xcite .",
    "finally , with the situation described in , similar to the hom one @xcite , we propose an experiment with oscillatory potentials that is able to test the signature of our contribution over other possible explanations of the unexpected experimental results in this type of hom systems ( decoherence @xcite , spurious effects @xcite , time delay @xcite or interaction between different modes @xcite ) .",
    "+    , we see its evolution in the inset figure . with this experiment , we can prove the reliability of our predictions .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we discuss the two - particle scattering and how it is possible to measure at the same position two initially identical electrons after the interaction with the time - dependent potential barrier . in we explain how quantum noise is computed taking into account these new two - particles scattering possibilities .",
    "we named these probabilities as `` new '' because a zero probability for such process is predicted by the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite . in",
    "we explain a procedure which will be able to test the soundness of our proposal , through a time - dependent oscillatory double barrier potential .",
    "finally , in we conclude .",
    "we consider a oscillatory potential barrier system with two identical electrons , initially located at each side of the barrier at the same side , but with opposite momentum ( ) .",
    "we solve the two - particle time - dependent schrdinger equation ,    @xmath4 \\phi , \\label{scho}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the effective electron mass and @xmath6 takes into account the one - particle interaction between one electron and the time - dependent tunneling barrier depicted in .",
    "the exchange interaction is introduced in equation in the shape of the initial wave function @xmath7 .",
    "the anti - symmetrical many - particle wave function for two electrons is :    @xmath8    after the interaction with the barrier , in addition to the usual scattering probabilities where both electrons are found at each side of the barrier ( a ) and b ) ) , it is also possible to find both of them at the same side of the barrier , i.e. both at the left or both at the right side ( c ) and d ) ) .     and from the right @xmath9 of a scattering barrier .",
    "solid regions represent the barrier region and shaded regions represent the particle detectors .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) each particle is detected on a different side of the barrier at final time @xmath10 when the interaction with the barrier has almost finished .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) both particles are detected on the same side of the barrier . ]",
    "the only requirement to get the novel probabilities is that the initial states ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are described by localized ( normalizable ) wave functions ( and not the scattering states @xcite , which are infinitely extended in the space ) and an energy dependence in the scattering region .",
    "these new final scenarios are not in contradiction with the pauli principle as mentioned in the introduction . in our case",
    ", they can occur because , after the interaction with the barrier , the transmitted and reflected wave functions of the electrons suffer a different evolution and therefore they do not overlap , or at least not completely , allowing the possibility of being at the same place ( c ) and d ) ) with the same energy , but different spatial shape .",
    "for further discussion , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these new probabilities are reflected in equations and ( proved and derived in ref .",
    "the former describes the probability of two electrons being , both , at the left side of the barrier :    @xmath13    the latter provides the probability of both electrons being located at the right side :    @xmath14    finally , the probability of one particle at each side is :    @xmath15    in these expressions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the single - particle reflection and transmission coefficient of the i - wave packet .",

    "the time @xmath10 can be any time large enough so that the probability presence in the barrier region remains negligible .",
    "depending on the contribution of the overlapping term in equation , the probabilities , and can achieve two different particular limits :    * the landauer - bttiker results @xcite are recovered when @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 and therefore @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "thus there is no possibility of finding both particles at the same place .",
    "this limit is achieved when the wave packets are spatially large and similar ( not identical ) to an infinitely extended scattering states . *",

    "then , @xmath27 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this case is achieved when the wave packets , after the interaction with the barrier , are very different . for example , this occurs in the case of a double barrier , when both electrons have the resonant energy , but one is transmitted and the other is reflected .",
    "in this section , after having developed the new two - particle scattering probabilities @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we compute the quantum noise formula with the new possibilities ( c ) and d ) ) described above . the new formula will be compared to the landauer - bttiker expression and the  semiclassical \" equation for noise without exchange .",
    "+ for simplicity , we consider a symmetric system , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and thus @xmath34 . only one- and two - particle scattering processes",
    "are treated .",
    "the extension to many - particle processes will be detailed in a future work @xcite . at low frequencies ,",
    "when the displacement current is neglected , the noise can be computed from the knowledge of the number @xmath35 of transmitted particles through the barrier during the time @xmath36 :    @xmath37    we define @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the probability of @xmath35 particles being transmitted from the left to the right reservoir .",

    "however , we have showed that generally , @xmath47 and quantum noise is increased . in the limit of the distinguishable particles",
    "behaviour , the classical noise results are recovered @xmath48 and electrons behave as classical particles , without exchange interaction . in general ,",
    "the results predicted by equation lie among the landauer - bttiker formalism and the classical results .",
    "as mentioned in , there is a hom experiment @xcite where two identical electrons are injected simultaneously from two inputs and measured in two outputs . in the experiment ,",
    "it is found out that the possibility of measuring both electrons at the same side is not zero , as usually expected .",
    "apart from fve _ et al _ @xcite that explain this result because of the interaction among different landau levels in the inner channels when injecting the electrons , other explanations appeal for decoherence @xcite , spurious results @xcite and time delay in the injection @xcite .",
    "+ with the approach explained previously in , alternatively , a fundamental reason is given for the experiment results . due to the time- and energy - dependence evolution of the electron wave packet , after the interaction with the barrier , the reflected and transmitted components of the wave packets",
    "do not overlap completely .",
    "thus , there is no reason to expect that they can not be detected at the same place ( according to equations and ) because their states are different and then the exclusion pauli principle does not apply .",
    "the reader can find more details in ref .",
    "@xcite . + as it has been already exposed , one purpose of this work is to propose an experiment which would be able to test the reliability of our time - dependent explanation for the unexpected noise results .",
    "we analyze the case where two electrons are injected simultaneously with the same energy from both sides of a double barrier at the same distance from the barrier .",
    "this double barrier system has a time - dependent well ( see ) , which oscillates periodically according to expression @xmath49 . in order to increase the visualization of these new probabilities",
    ", we will consider the injection of electrons whose energies are close to the ( first ) resonant energy of the double barrier .",
    "for these energies , the transmission coefficient has a sharp energy - dependence so that the reflected and transmitted wave packets become almost orthogonal , @xmath50 .",
    "see further details in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , the new probabilities and become more relevant . + we expect that , by changing the potential level of the well inside the barrier , the resonant energy of the double barrier will change accordingly .",
    "this will cause that for some electrons that in the time - independent case were not resonant , and therefore their probability of finding both at same place was low , will be resonant , increasing enormously the probabilities of finding both of them at the same side of the barrier . + in our proposed experiment , there is always two electrons , one injected from each side of the barrier simultaneously , and therefore the only term which survives in equation is the last one ( because @xmath51 ) , which contains the new probability @xmath30 of finding both particles at the same side .",
    "therefore , the computation of @xmath30 provides directly , apart from a constant factor , the quantum noise in equation .",
    "+     is plotted as a function of the frequency of the oscillation well and also as a function of the central energy of the injected electrons .",
    "we see that for certain values , the overlapping is almost zero , corresponding to the resonant energies . ]",
    "we performed simulations for the experiment , as a function of the energy of the injected electrons and also of the frequency of the oscillation of the bottom potential of the quantum well .",
    "we chose as initial state for the electron wave functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 a gaussian function @xmath54^{1/4 } e^{ik_0(x - x_0)}e^{-(x - x_0)^2/\\sigma^2}$ ] , whose initial position is @xmath55 far from the center of the barrier , dispersion @xmath56 and initial central momentum is @xmath57 .",
    "the barrier is @xmath58 high , its thickness is @xmath59 and the quantum well length is @xmath60 .",
    "we emphasize that any other localized wave function can be chosen without modifying qualitatively the results discussed in this work .",
    "+ this result is seen in figures [ it d ] and [ plltd ] , where we plot the overlapping term @xmath18 ( equation and noise @xmath44 ( equation ) respectively , as a function of the energy of the electrons and also of the oscillatory frequency of the well .",
    "the results corresponding to the static case ( no oscillatory well ) are seen at frequency equal to zero . in this static situation ,",
    "the resonant energy is @xmath61 , and we appreciate in that at this energy value , the overlapping is minimum , and in that noise achieves its maximum value .",
    "+ in figure [ it d ] ( figure [ plltd ] ) , we observe that when we switch on the oscillation , the minimum ( maximum ) value for the overlapping @xmath18 ( noise @xmath44 ) moves .",
    "therefore , as we expected , resonant energies could be found for other energies even if in the static case they were not .",
    "moreover , the behaviour of the movement of the maximum values can be easily understood .",
    "as time passes by , the well potential increases . as frequencies are not very high ( compared to the inverse of the transit time @xmath62 ) , a first valid approximation to compute the resonant energy is :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the resonant energy when there is no oscillation in the well and @xmath65 the time that the electron takes to arrive to the barrier .",
    "this time @xmath65 is the space from the place where the injection is carried out until the barrier ( @xmath66 ) , divided by the velocity of the electron ( @xmath67 ) :    @xmath68    from equations and one realizes that the frequency for the maximum probabilities as a function of the resonant energy is :    @xmath69    which is in perfect agreement with the results observed in .",
    "there , we see that the peak values for noise at each energy , move accordingly to equation , which is plotted in the @xmath70-@xmath71 plane with a blue solid line .",
    "+ therefore , the simulations performed with sinusoidal potentials provide a clear behaviour : when we move to higher frequencies , quantum noise will be increased as we move to higher energies and will achieve a maximum at the new resonant energy .",
    "the experiment can be modified and include other behaviours when changing the potential according to another expression .",
    "for instance , @xmath72 , in this case the resonant energy will decrease as frequency increases ( mathematically , the negative sign in front of the sinusoidal signal can also be introduced as a negative frequency in the plot ) . in this work",
    ", we propose that this very particular behaviour of the maximum of the quantum noise @xmath73 in the @xmath70-@xmath71 plane can be use as a test of our novel physical explanation of non - zero correlations in this type of hom experiments with exchange and tunneling",
    ". the experimental confirmation of such predictions will , in fact , give support for the need of using time - dependent states when modelling quantum noise in such experiments even for static ( dc ) conditions .",
    "motivated by the hong - ou - mandel kind experiment on quantum noise performed with electrons @xcite , we analyze a similar two - particle scattering scenario with exchange and tunneling .",
    "we inject two identical electrons with opposite momenta in a double barrier potential with an oscillatory well .",
    "then , because of the different evolution suffered by the transmitted and reflected wave packet , we prove that two electrons can be found at the same place after the interaction with the barrier with probabilities given by equations and .",
    "these new probabilities lead to a novel quantum noise expression ( equation ) .",
    "we remark that this formula contains two particular and interesting limits : the quantum landauer - bttiker noise expression and the distinguishable classical noise result .",
    "+ finally , we perform numerical simulations for oscillatory potentials which can certify the soundness of the new probabilities explained above . we compute the new quantum noise as a function of the energy of the initial electrons and of the frequency of the oscillatory well .",
    "we show in that , the maximum value of noise changes in energy as frequency changes according to equation . we propose to reproduce these type of hom experiment with an oscillatory well .",
    "then , the satisfactory test on the experimental agreement of the maximum of the quantum noise with equation ( or similar ones depending on the condition of the experiment ) will , in fact , conclude that in order to extract all the phenomenology in scattering phenomena , the time - dependent evolution and localized nature of the electron can not be neglected .",
