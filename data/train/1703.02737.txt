    "quantum coherence originating from the quantum superposition principle is the most fundamental quantum feature of quantum mechanics .",
    "it plays an important role in various fields such as the thermodynamics @xcite , the transport theory @xcite , the living complexes @xcite and so on . with the resource - theoretic understanding of quantum feature in quantum information ,",
    "the quantification of coherence has attracted increasing interest in recent years @xcite and has also led to the operational resource theory of the coherence @xcite .",
    "the quantitative theory also makes it possible to understand one type of quantumness ( for example , the coherence ) by the other type of quantumness such as the entanglement and the quantum correlation , _ vice versa",
    "for example , for a bipartite pure state , the maximal extra average coherence that one party could gain was shown to be exactly characterized by the concurrence assisted by the local operations and classical communication ( locc ) with the other party @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the maximal average coherence was bounded by some type of quantum correlation in some particular reference framework . in the asymptotic regime ,",
    "@xcite showed that the rate of assisted coherence distillation for pure states was equal to the coherence of assistance under the local quantum - incoherent operations and classical communication .",
    "quite recently , a unified view of quantum correlation and quantum coherence has been given in ref .",
    "in addition , if only the incoherent operations are allowed , the state with certain amount of coherence assisted by an incoherent state can be converted to an entangled state with the same amount of entanglement @xcite or a quantum - correlated state with the same amount of quantum correlation @xcite .    in this paper , _ instead of the quantum correlation _ , we find , it is _ the classical correlation _ of a bipartite quantum state that limits the extra average coherence at one side induced by the unilateral measurement at the other side .",
    "we also find the necessary and sufficient condition for the zero maximal average coherence that could be gained with all the possible measurements taken into account . besides , we show , through some examples , that quantum correlation is neither sufficient nor necessary for the extra average coherence subject to a given measurement .",
    "we have selected both the basis - dependent and the basis - free coherence measure to study this question and obtain the similar conclusions . in particular",
    ", one should note that all our results are valid for the positive - operator - valued measurement ( povm ) , even though we only consider the local projective measurement in the main text .",
    "* coherence measure- * to begin with , let s first give a brief review of the measure of the quantum coherence @xcite . if a quantum state @xmath0 can be written as @xmath1 @xmath2 is incoherent with respect to the basis @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 denotes the set of incoherent states , then the operator @xmath5 is the incoherent operation if it satisfies @xmath6 .",
    "thus a good coherence measure @xmath7 of a @xmath8-dimensional state @xmath9 should be :    ( p1 ) nonnegative - i.e . , @xmath10 and @xmath11 if and only if the quantum state @xmath9 is incoherent .",
    "( p2 ) monotonic - i.e . , @xmath12 for any incoherent operation @xmath13 ; and strongly monotonic if @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "( p3 ) convex - i.e .",
    ", @xmath16 .",
    "even though there are many good coherence measures such as the coherence measures based on @xmath17-norm , trace norm , fidelity , the relative entropy and so on @xcite , in this paper we will only employ the relative entropy to quantify the quantum coherence , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relative entropy , @xmath20 is the von neumann entropy and @xmath21 is the diagonal matrix by deleting all the off - diagonal entries of any @xmath9 ( we will use this notation throughout the paper ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict ourselves in the computational basis throughout the paper .",
    "in contrast , the basis - free coherence ( or the total coherence ) @xcite is quantified by @xmath22 note that @xmath23 quantifies the maximal coherence of a state with all the bases taken into account .        * the classical correlation as the upper bound- * now let s turn to our game sketched in fig .",
    "suppose two players , alice and bob , share a two - particle quantum state @xmath24 and alice performs some projective measurement @xmath25 on her particle and sends her outcomes to bob .",
    "bob is nt allowed to do any operation .",
    "based on alice s outcomes , bob will obtain the state @xmath26 with the probability @xmath27 .",
    "thus in the computational basis , the measurement - induced average coherence ( miac : bob s average coherence induced by alice s measurement @xmath28 ) is given by @xmath29similarly , the measurement - induced average total coherence ( miatc : bob s average total coherence induced by alice s measurement @xmath28 ) is @xmath30 with @xmath8 denoting the dimension of bob s space .",
    "with alice s measurement @xmath28 , the bob s average coherence is usually different from the coherence of @xmath31.the extra miac @xmath32 and the extra miatc @xmath33 can be defined as @xmath34 it is obvious that @xmath35 which is impied by the convexity of the coherence @xmath36 , that is , @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",

    "_ consider the computational basis @xmath81 , the state @xmath82 where @xmath83 is hermitian and positive and @xmath84 .",
    "it is obvious that if @xmath85 for all @xmath86 , the states bob obtains are always diagonal subject to @xmath81 .",
    "that is , no extra miac can be obtained .",
    "if @xmath24 is a product state which implies @xmath87 , it means that the upper bound of the extra miac is zero based on theorem 2 .",
    "so no extra miac could be obtained .    on the contrary ,",
    "no extra miac includes two cases : one is that the final average coherence is zero , and the other is that the final nonzero average coherence is not increased compared with the coherence of @xmath88 .",

    "this can be seen as follows .",

    "the above theorems mainly show that , even though the coherence is the quantum feature of a quantum system , in the particular game as sketched in fig .",
    "1 , the extra average coherence obtained by bob with the assistance of alice s measurement is well bounded by the classical correlation of their shared state , instead of the quantum correlation .",
    "however , one can find that the necessity for all the attainable bounds is to share the pure states which happen to own the equal quantum and classical correlations .",
    "therefore , one could think that the classical correlation is trivial in contrast to the quantum correlation ( e.g. , quantum correlation serves as a tight upper bound , but is less than classical correlation ) .",

    "so there is no extra miac and miatc .",
    "this example shows that the extra average coherence is well bounded by the classical correlation .",

    "_ example 2 .",
    "no extra average coherence could be induced in the classical - quantum state .",
    "_ set the classical - quantum state as @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the reduced quantum states are given by @xmath125 since there is no quantum correlation subject to subsystem a , the corresponding classical correlation is directly determined by the total correlation as @xmath126    suppose that the projective measurement @xmath127 is performed on subsystem a while the subsystem b will collapse on the state @xmath128 with the equal probability @xmath129 .",
    "it is obvious that there is no extra average coherence ( @xmath130 ) gained by this measurement .",
    "however , if the projective measurement is selected as @xmath131 , subsystem b will be at the state @xmath132 and @xmath133 with the equal probability .",

    "( [ jvj ] ) .",

    "thus a simple calculation can show @xmath145 however , if we select another projective measurement @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 with @xmath149 , subsystem b will collapse to @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 with the probability @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that @xmath155 for @xmath149 which further leads to @xmath156 .",

    "theorem 3 implies that for pure states the extra miatc is the exact quantum entanglement of their shared state ( von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ) .",

    "<S> coherence is the most fundamental quantum feature in quantum mechanics . for a bipartite quantum state , </S>",
    "<S> if a measurement is performed on one party , the other party , based on the measurement outcomes , will collapse to a corresponding state with some probability and hence gain the average coherence . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the average coherence is not less than the coherence of its reduced density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is very surprising that the extra average coherence ( and the maximal extra average coherence with all the possible measurements taken into account ) is upper bounded by the classical correlation of the bipartite state instead of the quantum correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the sufficient and necessary condition for the null maximal extra average coherence . </S>",
    "<S> some examples demonstrate the relation and , moreover , show that quantum correlation is neither sufficient nor necessary for the nonzero extra average coherence within a given measurement . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the similar conclusions are drawn for both the basis - dependent and the basis - free coherence measure . </S>"
