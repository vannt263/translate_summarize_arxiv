    "until a decade ago and despite many searches , scientists had no definite evidence of astrophysical objects with masses between those of stars and planets .",
    "yet the missing link between these two , dubbed brown dwarfs , are now a field of study unto themselves .",
    "there remains much to learn about these failed stars , especially their astrophysical niches , origins and destinies .",
    "searching for brown dwarfs as companions to stars offers the opportunity to search systems very near to the sun and requires less time than field and cluster searches covering a relatively large portion of the sky .",
    "the very first serious brown dwarf candidate was discovered as a companion to the white dwarf gd 165 @xcite .",
    "gd 165b ( @xmath5 @xmath1 , @xmath6 k ) remained unique for a number of years but eventually became the prototype for a new spectral class of cool stars and brown dwarfs , the l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the first unambiguous brown dwarf was also discovered as a companion to a star , gl 229 @xcite .",
    "gl 229b ( @xmath7 @xmath1 , @xmath8 k ) became the prototype t dwarf @xcite , the coolest known spectral class , all of whose members are brown dwarfs .",
    "precision radial velocity techniques are sensitive to brown dwarfs orbiting within @xmath9 au but have revealed very few .",
    "@xcite estimate the brown dwarf companion frequency to be less than 0.5% .",
    "this figure includes the search of several hundred stars and is thus a very good measure for the innermost orbital separations .",
    "direct imaging searches have also produced a dearth of brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars ( relative to stellar companions ) at wider separations @xcite .",
    "the separation range corresponding to the peak in the stellar companion distribution for both g and m dwarf primaries is roughly @xmath10 au @xcite .",
    "this range and beyond has been searched quite extensively by the aforementioned surveys and very few brown dwarfs have been found .",
    "the most optimistic estimate for the brown dwarf companion frequency to main sequence stars is a few percent @xcite , although most studies conclude that it is less than 1% .",
    "the only exception being the case when the primary star is a very low mass star or brown dwarf ( @xmath11 @xmath1 ) .",
    "for these low mass primaries , the binary fraction is estimated to be @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus it appears that the brown dwarf companion frequency is a strong function of primary mass @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the details on 371 white dwarfs which were searched for low luminosity companions using near - infrared imaging arrays at several telescopes over the past 18 years .",
    "the particular techniques and analyses used for each camera data are described along with follow up observations .",
    "the white dwarf sample is analyzed from a kinematical perspective in order to make an overall age assessment ",
    "critical for any calculation of completeness as a function of secondary mass .",
    "the measured distribution of low mass companions is presented as a function of spectral type , which is then transformed into mass using existing empirical and theoretical relations .",
    "the implications for binary star formation and evolution are discussed .    within this supplement",
    "is a summary of all available data on known companions to the 371 white dwarfs in the sample . specifically included in this paper",
    "are new data and analysis of companions to white dwarfs previously reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "tables include proper motions , @xmath13 space velocities , spectral types , and distances for the white dwarf primaries .",
    "data on previously known or newly discovered companions ( including candidates ) includes optical and near - infrared photometry , low resolution optical spectra , and proper motion measurements .",
    "the core of this work was analysis of images obtained at steward observatory . beginning in 1991 and continuing through 2003 ,",
    "a program to image nearby white dwarfs in the near - infrared was conducted on the bok 2.3 meter telescope at kitt peak , arizona .",
    "images of 273 targets were acquired using the bok facility near - infrared camera @xcite . the imaging procedure was to acquire @xmath14 band ( 1.2 @xmath15 m ) images in a 5-point dither pattern with 90 seconds integration per dither position for a total exposure time of 7.5 minutes .",
    "each raw science image was dark subtracted , flat fielded , scaled to the central image , registered , shifted and then averaged .    in order to determine the completeness of the steward survey , it was necessary to measure the flux of the faintest reliably detectable sources in images taken over the entire length of the study .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the number of objects detected with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath16 as a function of @xmath14 magnitude in images representative of each observing run conducted at steward observatory .",
    "the survey was complete to @xmath17 mag .",
    "it is estimated that 37% of @xmath18 mag and 57% of @xmath19 mag objects were missed .    in the last two years of this survey ,",
    "supplementary data were gathered at lick observatory on the shane 3 meter telescope with the gemini camera @xcite .",
    "gemini sits behind a telescope that is 70% larger than the bok telescope and employs nearly identical detector technology . @xmath14 band data acquired with gemini generally went about 1 magnitude deeper , providing greater sensitivity to @xmath20 mag objects .",
    "however , the completeness limit of this survey remains at @xmath17 mag and all calculations will be restricted to this edge .",
    "the steward survey was a common proper motion companion search . by imaging the field around a target white dwarf at two epochs separated by a sufficient interval of time , the proper motion of the white dwarf can be measured and compared to any motions exhibited by stars in that field .",
    "geomap , a program within the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) was used for this task .",
    "this program creates a general transformation between two sets of coordinates corresponding to sources in the same field at two different epochs .",
    "proper motion stars can be identified by their residuals from this map and their motions measured against the near zero motion of background stars and galaxies , which provide a measure of the standard error .",
    "a typical white dwarf with 5 or more field stars produced a map with a standard deviation in the residuals of approximately @xmath21 pixels or @xmath22 on the steward camera . with a typical time baseline of 5 years , proper motions as small as @xmath23 @xmath24 can be measured at the @xmath25 level .",
    "these are characteristic values ",
    "the actual measurement values and errors depend on the proper motion of a particular white dwarf , the number of field sources with good s / n , the quality of the images at each epoch , and the time baseline between epochs ( which varied between 2 and 10 years ) . additionally , many proper motions for white dwarf targets and candidate companions were measured using the digitized versions of large sky survey photographic plates , such as the palomar observatory sky survey i and ii . although the spatial resolution of these scans is lower ( @xmath26 @xmath27 ) than the near - infrared data , the epochs are separated by @xmath28 years and hence provide better measurements and smaller errors .      from 1995 to 2001 , a program to image nearby white dwarfs at near - infrared wavelengths was conducted on the keck i 10 meter telescope at mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "images of 91 targets were acquired using nirc @xcite .",
    "these data were not taken in an analogous way to the data collected at steward .",
    "in general , each target was observed at @xmath14 and usually one or more of the following bands in order of decreasing usage : @xmath29 ( 1.0 @xmath15 m ) , @xmath30 ( 2.2 @xmath15 m ) , @xmath31 ( 1.6 @xmath15 m ) .",
    "a typical total integration time at @xmath14 was @xmath32 seconds times 5 dithers .",
    "data at all wavelengths were reduced in a manner identical to the steward data .",
    "it is not possible to establish a completeness limit in the same way as for the steward data ( figure [ fig1 ] ) because the relatively small nirc field of view did not contain sufficient background sources .",
    "an analysis was performed on many images representative of each observing run conducted at keck .",
    "@xmath14 magnitudes and s / ns were measured for faint but reliably detected objects in the images . the result being that @xmath33 mag or brighter objects were consistently detected with @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the nirc survey is likely complete down to @xmath35 mag .",
    "the @xmath36 and/or @xmath37 color of point sources in the field of the white dwarf , together with their flux relative to the primary at these wavelengths , were used to filter out uninteresting background stars and discriminate candidate companions .",
    "data were taken at @xmath29 & @xmath14 for about 75% of the white dwarfs in this survey .",
    "for the remainder of the sample , images were obtained at @xmath30 for all fields which contained point sources at @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath36 color is the most indicative of low mass stars and brown dwarfs because it is monotonically increasing with decreasing effective temperature , unlike @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "if a candidate could not be ruled out based on these criteria , then a follow up image was taken at a later epoch in order to perform astrometry and search for common proper motion .",
    "for each confirmed or candidate common proper motion companion , optical photometry and spectroscopy , in addition to near - infrared photometry , was performed in order to identify or constrain its temperature and class . near - infrared @xmath38 data were acquired with the same instruments used for the wide field survey , namely the steward and gemini cameras .",
    "images were taken and reduced in a similar manner to the survey observations .",
    "optical @xmath39 data were obtained at lick observatory using the nickel 1 meter telescope ccd camera . in general , exposures were @xmath40 minutes depending on conditions and individual target brightness .",
    "images were cleaned of bad pixels in the area of interest , bias subtracted , flat fielded and averaged if there were multiple frames .",
    "optical spectroscopic data were acquired at lick observatory using the kast dual spectrograph on the shane 3 meter telescope .",
    "the exact setup varied between observing runs but all observations were done at low resolution ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "additional spectroscopy was performed at steward observatory using the boller & chivens spectrograph on the bok 2.3 meter telescope .",
    "all optical spectra were reduced using standard iraf software .",
    "the spectral images were bias subtracted , cleaned of bad pixels and cosmic rays , then flat fielded . for each target , two spectra of the sky were extracted , averaged and subtracted from the extracted target spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectra were wavelength and flux calibrated by comparison with observed lamp spectra and standard stars .",
    "no attempt was made to remove telluric features .",
    "optical and near - infrared magnitudes and colors were used as the main source of constraints for stellar classification and spectral typing of the discovered companions . using a circular aperture centered on the target star and an annulus on the surrounding sky ,",
    "both the flux and s / n were calculated for a range of apertures from one to four full widths at half maximum .",
    "the flux measurement was taken at or near the aperture size which produced the largest s / n . in this way the flux of all targets was measured , including photometric standard stars .",
    "a fairly large aperture was used for all calibrators , and flux measurements for science targets were corrected to this standard aperture .",
    "optical and near - infrared standard stars were taken from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .      as mentioned in  1",
    ", there was a previous phase to the search for substellar companions to white dwarfs that began in late 1986 @xcite .",
    "although carried out on several different telescopes and instruments , the majority of those data were obtained at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "because some results of the irtf survey were previously published , the details will not be discussed here .",
    "however , those results will be updated below and the white dwarfs surveyed at the irtf will be included in the overall sample and statistics . of the over 150 white dwarfs observed during this early phase , 66",
    "were later reobserved at either keck or steward observatory .",
    "there were 84 white dwarf targets observed at the irtf and not elsewhere .",
    "although data at both @xmath14 and @xmath30 were taken for about one fourth to one third of the stars surveyed , all 371 white dwarfs in the sample were searched for near - infrared excess emission .",
    "a digital finding chart of each white dwarf was overlaid with the 2mass point source catalog data .",
    "the measured @xmath42 values for the the white dwarf were then compared to the model predicted values extrapolated from optical data based on the effective temperature of the star .",
    "stars with excess emission and good s / n at one or more of these near - infrared wavelengths were noted as possible or probable binaries .",
    "nearly every target observed for this project can be found in either current or earlier versions of the white dwarf catalog of @xcite .",
    "the catalog is mostly composed of stars selected by one of two criteria : ( 1 ) faint proper motion stars or ( 2 ) stars with ultraviolet excess .",
    "most of these stars were spectroscopically confirmed to be white dwarfs , but there remains some contamination by nondegenerate stars .",
    "hot subdwarfs , blue horizontal branch stars , bl lacertae objects , and population ii stars all display one of the characteristics above and can have spectra difficult to differentiate from that of a white dwarf with older photographic techniques .",
    "a sample of nearby hot and massive white dwarfs is ideal to search for substellar companions .",
    "proximity to the sun is desirable for the ability to partially or totally resolve close companions from the primary star and because flux falls off inversely as the square of the distance .",
    "hot white dwarfs are `` recently deceased '' and are therefore younger than their cooler counterparts . a typical white dwarf with @xmath43 @xmath1 and @xmath44 k has been cooling for only 70 myr @xcite .",
    "most massive white dwarfs ( @xmath45 @xmath1 ) are thought to descend from main sequence progenitors with masses , 6 @xmath46 8 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "hence massive white dwarfs have a total age on par with their cooling age because the main sequence lifetime of the progenitor would have been relatively short .",
    "although a large ( @xmath47 ) sample with all three characteristics does not exist , these attributes were guiding principles in selecting stars for the survey .",
    "proper motion can be an indicator of age relative to the three basic kinematic populations of the galaxy : young disk ( @xmath48 gyr ) , old disk ( @xmath49 gyr ) , and halo stars ( @xmath50 gyr ) .",
    "ages between @xmath51 gyr are considered intermediate disk ages . in general , the @xmath13 space velocities ( and perhaps more important , velocity dispersions ) of stellar populations increase with increasing age .",
    "this is primarily due to gravitational upscattering for disk objects , while the halo is a distinctly separate kinematical group in every sense .",
    "therefore in general , smaller values of @xmath52 and ( @xmath53 , for a given kinematical sample , are correlated with younger objects @xcite .",
    "although it is three dimensional space motion that determines kinematic populations and indicates likely membership for an individual star , proper motion is often used as a proxy because the radial velocity ( @xmath54 ) is not known . in addition , it is particularly challenging to measure the radial velocity of white dwarfs due to their wide , pressure broadened line profiles and intrinsic faintness . however , two studies have compared the @xmath13 space motions of over 100 white dwarfs in wide binaries calculated with and without the assumption @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "accurate radial velocities obtained from a widely separated main sequence component in each binary yielded two major conclusions : ( 1 ) the overall sample kinematics were consistent with the old , metal - poor disk population and ( 2 ) the assumption of @xmath55 did _ not _ significantly affect the results @xcite .",
    "this is an important result because , in the end , the sample of white dwarfs in the present work can only be tied together with kinematics .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] lists all 395 target stars observed at all facilities beginning in 1990 .",
    "the first column lists the white dwarf number from @xcite , except where noted , followed by a name of the star in the second column .",
    "the third column lists the spectral type of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the integer value in column three represents the effective temperature index , defined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the fourth column lists the distance , @xmath58 , in parsecs as determined photometrically , using the best available data in the literature and models , or by trigonometric parallax .",
    "the fifth and sixth columns are the proper motion , @xmath15 , in arcseconds per year , followed by the position angle , @xmath59 , in degrees .",
    "these quantities were taken from the most accurate and reliable source available . in decreasing order",
    "these are : the tycho 2 catalog @xcite , the ucac catalogs @xcite , the usno b1.0 catalog @xcite , and the white dwarf catalog of @xcite and references therein .",
    "a few proper motions were measured for this work .",
    "the seventh column lists the galactic @xmath13 space velocity , corrected for the solar motion @xmath60 @xcite relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) in km @xmath61 .",
    "these quantities were calculated from the vector ( @xmath62 ) where @xmath63 is the right ascension , @xmath64 the declination , and @xmath65 was assumed to provide a uniform treatment of the sample .",
    "@xmath66 is taken to be positive toward the galactic anticenter , @xmath67 positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath68 positive toward the north galactic pole .",
    "the eigth column lists the facility or facilities at which the white dwarf was observed : s = steward , k = keck , i = irtf .",
    "the galactic @xmath13 space motions and statistics for the white dwarf sample was calculated in order to evaluate the most probable range of stellar ages .",
    "as stated above , smaller values of @xmath13 and their dispersions , implying more circular galactic orbits , correlate with younger stellar populations that have experienced fewer gravitational events since their birth in and around the spiral arms @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl-2 ] contains the kinematical properties calculated for the white dwarf sample .",
    "the quantity @xmath69 is the total space velocity with respect to the lsr @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the total dispersion in space velocity @xmath72 .",
    "the sample does not appear to consist primarily of old , metal - poor disk stars .",
    "it seems likely that the sample contains a relatively high fraction of stars with intermediate and young disk kinematics ",
    "stars with ages @xmath73 gyr .    in figure [ fig2 ] , the white dwarf sample is plotted in the @xmath74 and @xmath75 planes .",
    "also shown in the figure are the 1 and 2 @xmath76 velocity ellipsoids for old , metal - poor disks stars from @xcite  a kinematical study of the halo and thick disk utilizing a large sample of nonkinematically selected metal - poor stars .",
    "the ellipsoid parameters in figure [ fig2 ] were taken from the first row of table 1 in @xcite , 141 stars with @xmath77 [ fe / h ] @xmath78 and @xmath79 kpc .",
    "@xmath80 is the scale height above the galactic plane , and hence this old disk sample is unlikely to be contaminated significantly by halo stars .",
    "the ellipsoids are centered at @xmath81 km @xmath61 with axes @xmath82 km @xmath83 . from figure [ fig2 ] and table [ tbl-2 ]",
    "it is clear that the white dwarf sample is centered much closer to @xmath84 , values that represent the undisturbed circular galactic disk orbits of younger stars @xcite .",
    "older disk stars lag behind the galactic rotation of the lsr and hence have increasingly negative @xmath67 velocities with increasing age @xcite .",
    "comparison of the values in table [ tbl-2 ] with the values for kinematical populations of known ages from @xmath85 measurements of nearby stars , yields additional evidence that the white dwarf sample contains young disk stars .",
    "the average @xmath13 , their dispersions , and the total velocity dispersion @xmath86 values of the entire sample are consistent with those of disk stars of intermediate age ( @xmath87 gyr ) , but inconsistent with stars of age @xmath88 gyr due to the relatively small negative value of @xmath89 .",
    "this comes from a direct comparison of table [ tbl-2 ] with table 5 & figures @xmath90 of @xcite , and with table 4 of @xcite .",
    "in fact , the subsample in table [ tbl-2 ] , white dwarfs with @xmath91 , is quite consistent with stars of age @xmath92 gyr @xcite .",
    "the white dwarfs surveyed in this work are not similar to the white dwarf samples of @xcite and @xcite , which clearly belong to the old disk kinematical population ( @xmath49 gyr ) .",
    "neither is the sample similar to any of the white dwarf kinematic subgroups in @xcite with the exception of the dh and dp stars ( magnetic white dwarfs ) .",
    "the sample of magnetic white dwarfs in @xcite was expanded from only 13 stars to 26 stars in @xcite with the same results ( both studies assumed @xmath55 as in this work )  these stars appear to have young disk kinematics .",
    "in fact , the subsample of moderate proper motion white dwarfs in table [ fig2 ] have nearly identical kinematical properties as magnetic white dwarfs , implying relatively young ages ( @xmath92 gyr ) @xcite .",
    "it must be kept in mind that the present sample consists of a mixture of hot and cool degenerate stars .",
    "the cooling age of a typical hot white dwarf ( @xmath93 k ) is less than 500 myr but the main sequence progenitor age is not known .",
    "hence the total ages of hot white dwarfs in the sample are potentially consistent with relatively young disk objects . but for cool white dwarfs in the sample , it is more likely that they are intermediate age disk stars .",
    "for example , a white dwarf with @xmath94 k is at least 1.5 gyr old according to cooling theory @xcite .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "is plotted the number of white dwarfs in the sample versus effective temperature index .",
    "exactly 90% of the sample stars have temperatures above 8000 k ",
    "implying cooling ages less than 1.1 gyr for typical hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "moreover , 67% of the sample have temperatures above 11,500 k and typical cooling ages less than 0.4 gyr . hence the cooling ages of the sample stars are consistent with the total age estimate inferred from kinematics  that of a relatively young disk population .",
    "since one does not know the main sequence progenitor ages for the white dwarf sample , caution must be taken not to over interpret the kinematical results . in principle",
    ", any individual star of any age can have any velocity .",
    "it is possible to estimate total ages for white dwarfs if their mass is known by using the initial to final mass relation @xcite .",
    "however , this is only feasible for da white dwarfs ( whose masses can be determined spectroscopically ) , white dwarfs with dynamical mass measurements , or those with trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .",
    "the sample in table [ tbl-1 ] contains many degenerates with no mass estimate and therefore no way to confirm or rule out the relatively young total ages indicated by their kinematics .",
    "while their cooling ages are consistent with young disk objects , a conservative approach would be to explore a range of ages when interpreting the implications of the survey results .",
    "realistically , a typical white dwarf in the sample is likely to be between @xmath87 gyr old .",
    "table [ tbl-3 ] lists all companions to white dwarf sample stars detected in this work or published in the literature .",
    "many targets were thought to be single white dwarfs when this project began in the late 1980 s but subsequently have been established to be binaries in various studies .",
    "although only low mass stellar and substellar companions were directly sought in this study , the overall multiplicity of white dwarfs is of astrophysical interest for many reasons",
    ". the first column lists the name of the companion .",
    "this is generally the name of the white dwarf primary plus the letter `` b '' for a secondary , or `` c '' for a tertiary . the second column lists the known or suspected spectral type of the companion , while the third column lists the primary white dwarf number . for companions discovered in this work",
    ", spectral types were estimated from optical and near - infrared colors with the longest baselines ( such as @xmath95 ) .",
    "the fourth column lists the primary spectral type .",
    "the fifth and sixth columns list the separation on the sky and position angle of resolved companions .",
    "if unresolved , an upper limit to the separation is given , whereas a designation of `` close '' implies the system is a known radial velocity variable .",
    "the seventh and eighth columns list the best distance estimate for the white dwarf and the projected separation of the binary .",
    "the ninth column lists the absolute @xmath67 magnitude for white dwarf companions or the absolute @xmath30 magnitude for low mass stellar and substellar companions .",
    "the final column lists references to the initial discovery , critical data and analysis of each companion .    in all , there are 83 companion objects in 75 stellar systems containing at least one white dwarf : 76 doubles , 6 triples , and 1 quadruple system .",
    "of all the companions , excepting gd 1400b , there are 18 white dwarfs and 64 main sequence stars , and 1 brown dwarf .",
    "there were 24 multiple systems independently discovered in this work , 20 of which are reported here for the first time and the remaining 4 previously published @xcite .",
    "in addition , new data and analysis of 32 binaries reported in @xcite and @xcite have resulted in more accurate descriptions of those systems .",
    "white dwarfs with @xmath96 k have blue or zero optical and near - infrared colors .",
    "cooler white dwarfs will have colors that are just slightly red @xcite .",
    "for example , a typical white dwarf with @xmath97 k will have @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "very low mass stars and brown dwarfs have radii that are approximately 10 times larger than a typical white dwarf radius , @xmath100 @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "therefore , despite very low effective temperatures and luminosities , an unresolved cool companion to a white dwarf can dominate the spectral energy distribution of the system at longer wavelengths , especially in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "therefore , a white dwarf with red colors in the near - infrared or red portion of the optical spectrum can indicate the presence of an unresolved cool companion @xcite .",
    "there are basically two methods for obtaining parameters for unresolved low mass stellar or substellar companions to white dwarfs  optical and/or near - infrared photometry or optical spectroscopy .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy is not typically performed because spectral types for low mass stars and cool dwarfs in general ( m & l dwarfs ) were established optically @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy can reveal unresolved companions to white dwarfs for a range of white dwarf to red dwarf luminosity ratios .",
    "if the white dwarf is cool enough and/or the red dwarf is bright enough , a composite spectrum can be seen even in the blue and visual portion of the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "red dwarf companions which are too dim , relative to their white dwarf hosts , in the blue or visual can still be seen at red optical wavelengths ( @xmath102  ; @xcite ) . to extract information on the companion",
    ", one can visually examine the spectrum and compare it to known spectral types .",
    "for better accuracy , one can fit the bluest portion of the spectrum with models and effectively subtract the contribution of the white dwarf , leaving only the companion spectrum for analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the lowest luminosity companions to white dwarfs do not contribute a relatively sufficient amount of light in the optical for accurate spectral typing or study if they are unresolved @xcite .",
    "near - infrared methods must be used for these companions . near - infrared spectroscopy",
    "can verify the presence of a companion , but has only a limited ability to provide a spectral type for the reason mentioned above .",
    "the most successful method for doing so uses near - infrared photometry . with models",
    ", one can extrapolate the flux of the white dwarf into the near - infrared and subtract its expected contribution , thereby obtaining photometry for any unresolved , very low luminosity companion @xcite . the resulting near - infrared colors ( or near - infrared plus red optical colors or upper limits ) can be compared with the colors of known isolated low luminosity objects such as late m dwarfs and l dwarfs for determination of spectral type @xcite .    in this work",
    ", both near - infrared and optical colors resulting from photometry were used to estimate spectral types for all unresolved companions , while optical spectroscopy was used to verify the presence of the companion , where possible .",
    "most of the white dwarf primaries with unresolved cool companions are quite well studied and hence model extrapolation to longer wavelengths is likely to be reliable .",
    "the model grids of p. bergeron ( 2002 , private communication ) for pure hydrogen and pure helium atmosphere white dwarfs were used to predict @xmath103 fluxes for white dwarfs in such systems .",
    "these fluxes , together with the measured composite fluxes , were then used to calculate @xmath103 magnitudes for the unresolved red dwarf component of the binary .",
    "the resulting optical and near - infrared colors were then compared to those of @xcite to determine spectral type . unlike both @xcite and @xcite , absolute @xmath30 magnitudes of the companions were generally not used to estimate spectral type .",
    "figures [ fig4][fig23 ] are finding charts for companions reported here for the first time , including candidate companions .",
    "in the case of pg 1619 + 123 , its newly identified common proper motion companion , hd 147528 , is already known and hence no chart is provided here .",
    "the objects gd 392b , lds 826c , & pg 0922 + 162b were discovered independently in the course of this survey but are previously published with finding charts @xcite .",

    "is that the uncertainty in the measured proper motions is not a total measurement error .",
    "this is because there was no independent astrometric calibration apart from the point sources in each individual mapped field .",
    "in essence only _ relative proper motions _ were measured , not the absolute positions of the stars .",
    "the uncertainties reported by geomap are the root mean square of the map residuals and do not take into account the following factors : ( 1 ) any overall nonzero motion of objects in the map , ( 2 ) the number of objects used in the map , ( 3 ) the s / n for individual point sources and their measured coordinate centroids in the map .",
    "the fields used to measure proper motions were between @xmath108 and @xmath109 in size , hence the number of field stars was limited , especially at higher galactic latitudes .",
    "saturated stars are also unreliable because they can skew the centroiding process , as are faint field stars due to low s / n .",
    "therefore , the table [ tbl-4 ] measurements should be considered of only limited accuracy .",
    "this is also the main reason that a few candidate companions have been retained for further investigation despite apparently discrepant measured proper motions (  6 ) .",
    "ironically , there was only a single common proper motion companion detected solely in the near - infrared and not also in the optical .",
    "all other pairs were essentially detectable by `` blinking '' the first and second epoch digitized sky survey scans ( e.g. in the northern hemisphere , the first and second epoch palomar observatory sky survey plates ) .",
    "these digitized scans were also used to measure proper motions when possible because the longer time baselines provide higher accuracy and the ability to measure smaller proper motions .",
    "there are 3 new and 11 previously known visual binaries @xmath110 studied here for which no proper motion measurement was made . in a few cases",
    ", there exists insufficient time baseline between available images in which the pair is resolved to measure proper motions , or the data available in proper motion catalogs are for the composite pair ( whether unresolved or extended ) or absent . but for most , the companionship of the visual pair is highly probable due to one or more of the following : ( 1 ) an unchanging visual separation and position angle or elongation axis between the pair over @xmath111 years ( this is essentially equivalent to a common proper motion determination because most if not all of these pairs have @xmath112 and can be clearly seen moving with respect to background stars by `` blinking '' two dss epochs ) , ( 2 ) the common photometric distance implied by the spectral energy distributions of both components together with the statistical likelihood of companionship based on proximity in the sky , ( 3 ) spectroscopic evidence presented here or elsewhere , ( 4 ) astrometric evidence presented elsewhere .",
    "the majority of the objects in @xcite and @xcite are unresolved white dwarf plus red dwarf binaries .",
    "as discussed in  4.2 , the parameters of the two components must be deconvolved from one another .",
    "most of these binaries were investigated with a thorough and updated literature search , optical photometry and spectroscopy to both confirm the identity and further constrain the properties of the low mass companion .",
    "this resulted in a higher confidence in their spectral classifications .",
    "for those partially or completely resolved pairs previously reported , all with @xmath113 , ",
    "4.3 applies .",
    "generally speaking , the updated analysis of known low mass stellar companions has shown they have spectral types which are earlier than previous estimates .",
    "this is because early m dwarfs can contribute a significant amount of flux at optical wavelengths and cause a white dwarf to appear redder ( in @xmath114 for example ) and more luminous ( at @xmath67 for example ) than it would as a solitary star .",
    "the effective temperature inferred for the white dwarf will be too low , and the inferred distance modulus will be too close ( because @xmath115 will be too dim and @xmath67 will be too bright ; @xcite ) .",
    "circular aperture photometry was used to determine instrumental fluxes and magnitudes for all unresolved and resolved binary stars in this work (  2.3 ) .",
    "comparison with one or more standard stars yielded the true magnitudes listed in tables [ tbl-5 ] & [ tbl-6 ] .",

    "well resolved from each other @xmath116 and from neighboring stars , the flux measurement error was generally 5% or less for @xmath117 , where @xmath118 mag for @xmath119 , and @xmath120% or greater otherwise . for separations smaller than @xmath121 between target star and neighbor or companion , overlapping point spread functions ( psfs ) effectively contaminate flux measurements even in small apertures of @xmath122 pixels in radii . in these cases ,",
    "the iraf program daophot was used to simultaneously fit two or more psfs within a given area , deconvolve and extract their individual fluxes .",
    "this method works quite well for pairs with @xmath123 mag or less and generates errors equivalent to those quoted above .",
    "table [ tbl-5 ] lists all photometry for resolved binary components , including those stars requiring psf deconvolution from neighbors or companions .",
    "close binaries consisting of a white dwarf plus red dwarf which were indistinguishable from a single point source were treated as a single star and aperture photometry performed accordingly .",

    "the second line gives the predicted magnitudes for the white dwarf ( wd ) component based on the most current hydrogen and helium atmosphere model grids of p. bergeron ( 2002 , private communication ) , which are considered more accurate than previous generations @xcite .",
    "the predicted white dwarf magnitudes are calculated by adding model colors ( appropriate for its @xmath126 , and log @xmath127 if known ) to a photometric bandpass that is essentially uncontaminated by its cool red dwarf companion  either @xmath66 or @xmath128 ( or @xmath67 in a few rare cases ) .",
    "if the calculation was done from @xmath66 , a reference is given for the photometry .",
    "the temperature and surface gravity used as input for the models are taken from the most reliable sources available with the reference provided .",

    "based on comparisons with @xcite , spectral types were estimated from @xmath130 . unlike @xmath37 , which is highly degenerate across most of the m type dwarf spectral class , @xmath130 is essentially monotonically increasing from m2 until well into the l spectral class @xcite .",
    "some binary systems lack data at one or multiple wavelengths due to unavoidable circumstances including , but not limited to : time constraints , poor weather , instrument problems , telescope pointing limits , and telescope size .",
    "the purpose of the spectroscopy was to identify the spectral class of companions .",
    "standard stars and spectral flats were taken to ensure the target spectra were free of both detector and instrument response .",
    "none of the spectra were corrected for telluric features or extinction . in the case of white dwarfs ,",
    "the purpose was to look for the presence or absence of highly pressure broadened hydrogen or helium lines ( implying spectral classes da , db , or dc for no lines ) . in the case of m dwarfs , the search was for the characteristic tio and cah bands .",

    "sodium at 5880   can be seen very brightly in kast spectra and can be difficult or impossible to remove completely in low s / n observations . hence positive and negative residuals often remain . during one observing run with the kast ,",
    "the red side of the spectrograph was used without any dichroic or blocking filter on the blue side .",
    "hence second order blue light was present in the red spectra of all objects excepting very red objects such as single m dwarfs .",
    "this effect was mostly , but not completely , removed by calibrating with a standard star observed in the same arrangement .",
    "the one spectroscopic observing run with the boller & chivens spectrograph at steward observatory was over 3 nights with a very bright moon .",
    "the solar spectrum reflected from the moon can be seen quite brightly over the entire chip and was generally stable and removable .",
    "however , the regions around the balmer lines were problematic in a few instances and some lower s / n spectra still contain residuals in the region around h@xmath63 , h@xmath131 , and h@xmath132 .",
    "a few miscellaneous stars were observed with lris @xcite at the keck telescope because they were considered important yet too faint to obtain reliable spectra with a 3 meter class telescope .",
    "the observations were kindly performed by colleagues at other institutions . in a few cases , calibration stars were not observed and hence the flux calibration is not perfect and had to be adjusted as best possible .    in several of the binary systems reported here ,",
    "the primary white dwarf is poorly documented in the literature , or missing all together .",
    "spectra are displayed in figures [ fig24][fig31 ] in order of decreasing temperature for those stars which do not have published spectra or are misclassified or missing from the literature , for new white dwarf identifications , and for those systems where binarity or other issues have precluded proper analysis .",

    "in figure [ fig54 ] is plotted the number of unevolved low mass companions versus spectral type for objects studied in this work . despite excellent sensitivity to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs in all survey phases ,",
    "very few were detected",
    ".    for comparison , figure [ fig55 ] shows similar statistics for cool field dwarfs within 20 pc of earth taken from @xcite .",
    "the data plotted in figure [ fig55 ] have been corrected for volume , sky coverage , and estimated completeness .",
    "can one reconcile figure [ fig55 ] with the common notion that there are at least as many brown dwarfs as low mass stars @xcite ? to resolve this possible discrepancy , most field brown dwarfs would have to be of spectral type t or later , since it is clear from the figure that , in the field , l dwarfs are much less common than stars .",
    "however , there are several things to keep in mind regarding the relative number of field brown dwarfs versus stars",
    ". there should be be a relative dearth of l dwarfs compared to t type and cooler brown dwarfs in the field because cooling brown dwarfs pass through the l dwarf stage relatively rapidly .",
    "the lower end of the substellar mass function is poorly constrained at present @xcite and the relative number of substellar objects versus low mass stars in the field depends on the shape of the mass function in addition to the unknown minimum mass for the formation of self - gravitating substellar objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even for only moderately rising mass functions , such as those measured for substellar objects in open clusters @xcite , there will be more brown dwarfs than stars if the minimum formed , self - gravitating substellar mass is @xmath133 @xmath1 .",
    "ongoing and future measurements of the local t dwarf space density will constrain the substellar field mass function .",
    "figures [ fig54 ] & [ fig55 ] are quite similar . clearly , the peak frequency in spectral type occurs around m3.5 for both field dwarfs and companions to white dwarfs .",
    "in fact , the peak is identical ; 25.6% for both populations . by itself",
    ", this could imply a common formation mechanism , a companion mass function similar to the field mass function in this mass range .",
    "but , relative to the peak , there are @xmath134 times more l dwarfs and @xmath135 times more m6@xmath136m9 dwarfs in the field than companions . for the t dwarf regime",
    ", uncertainty remains because only the keck portion of the white dwarf survey was sensitive to such cool brown dwarfs ( and only for certain separations ) plus the current incomplete determination of the field population density .",
    "hence , binary systems with small mass ratios @xmath137 are rare for white dwarf progenitors ( which typically have main sequence masses @xmath138 @xmath1 ) .",
    "although there exists some speculation regarding the possibility that brown dwarfs are ejected in the early stages of multiple system or cluster formation , there is currently no evidence of this occurring .",
    "it is conceivable that low mass companions in very wide orbits may be lost to gravitational encounters in the galactic disk over a few billion years , but given the fact that there are a dozen or so known l and t dwarfs in wide binaries , this seems like a rare mechanism , if it occurs at all .",
    "it is possible that very low mass companions to intermediate mass stars undergo major or catastrophic alteration during the red giant or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "it has been calculated that there is a critical mass , @xmath139 @xmath140 , below which low mass companions are completely evaporated or cannibalized within the agb envelope @xcite . above @xmath141 companions may accrete a significant amount of material during inspiral , perhaps enough to transform into low mass stars @xcite .",
    "it is not yet empirically known whether any of these scenarios actually occur in nature .",
    "if they do , then the possibility of secondary evaporation should be less likely for the companion mass range in question here @xmath142 @xmath140 , but it is not certain . in ",
    "5.4 , the secondary spectral types in binaries which may have experienced a common envelope phase will be compared to those which did not .    in a way",
    ", the relative dearth of late m dwarfs alleviates a potential interpretation problem .",
    "had it been the case that many late m dwarfs were detected but only one or two l dwarfs , it might have been argued that the l dwarfs were cooling beyond the sensitivity of the search . since all m dwarfs ( and the first few l dwarf subclasses ) at @xmath143 gyr",
    "are stellar according to theory , this concern does not exist .",
    "the measured dearth is real and is not caused by brown dwarf cooling and the resulting lower sensitivity .",
    "dynamical masses measurements do not exist for any of the companions described in this work .",
    "there are a few systems  close white dwarf plus red dwarf spectroscopic binaries  whose secondary masses have been estimated @xcite .",
    "this is not a mass measurement as it ultimately relies on models , and what is really measured in these systems is the mass ratio ( hence the need for a white dwarf mass from models ) . but this method has been used successfully to estimate red dwarf masses that are consistent with both theory and existing dynamical mass measurements for low mass stars in the same range of spectral types , temperatures , and ages .    for m spectral types , the works of @xcite contain : ( 1 ) absolute magnitudes as a function of spectral type , ( 2 ) mass versus luminosity relations , ( 3 ) spectral type as a function of mass based on all available dynamical measurements of very low mass stars .",
    "these empirical and semiempirical relationships are for disk stars of intermediate age , which is appropriate for the sample of white dwarfs in this work .",
    "these relations have been used to provide masses for spectral types m1 through m9 .",
    "it is unnecessary to extrapolate these empirical relations into the l dwarf regime , because only two white dwarf plus l dwarf systems are known and both companions have published mass estimates from models , based on likely age ranges @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig56 ] shows the first step in the construction process ",
    "mass versus @xmath30 band luminosity relations from model , empirical and semiempirical relations .",
    "the models used are from @xcite and show tracks for ages of 1 and 5 gyr , appropriate for young to intermediate disk ages .",
    "the minimum mass for hydrogen burning ( hbmm ) in these models is @xmath144 @xmath1 .",
    "the track for 5 gyr turns downward ( relative to the track for 1 gyr ) before the stellar / substellar boundary because the lowest mass stars are still contracting onto the main sequence @xcite . below the hbmm ,",
    "the downturn is the result of brown dwarf cooling .    for the ages appropriate here , dynamical masses",
    "have been measured down to spectral type m6 @xmath145 @xmath1 ; @xcite ) , but none later .",
    "hence the empirical relation below this spectral type and corresponding mass is really semiempirical .",
    "adjustments had to be made according to the progress in this field over the past decade .",
    "for example , an extrapolation of the strictly empirical relation predicts a clearly substellar mass of 0.066 @xmath1 at spectral type m9 .",
    "this is not currently accepted as correct for intermediate disk ages @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig57 ] plots the absolute @xmath30 magnitude versus spectral type for all the low mass stellar and substellar companions discovered in this work .",
    "also plotted in the same figure is the combined empirical relation of @xcite and @xcite , both based on trigonometric parallax measurements .",
    "this figure demonstrates the possibility of inaccurate distance estimates for many of the white dwarf primaries and is the major reason why absolute magnitude was not used as a proximate for mass in this work .",
    "unlike previous work @xcite and similar studies @xcite  both of which employed @xmath146 as an indicator of spectral class  the present study uses spectral class itself .",
    "the reasons for this are twofold .",
    "first , in many cases photometric distances for white dwarfs are inaccurate for a variety of reasons .",
    "for example , because white dwarfs have varying radii at a given effective temperature , their distances can not be estimated with as much confidence as main sequence stars .",
    "binarity can also cause a white dwarf to have an erroneous distance estimate . @xcite",
    "found that , for a sample of six single white dwarfs , in general , the published photometric distance is an overestimate of the distance found by trigonometric parallax .",
    "second , @xmath146 is a proximate for luminosity , not for temperature .",
    "color and spectral type are temperature indicators and do not require a precise distance determination . for main sequence stars , the temperature can be used with an hr diagram ( i.e. an empirical radius versus temperature relation ) to calculate a mass .",
    "this is , in essence , what has been done in the present work .",
    "with perhaps one or two exceptions discussed in the appendix , all of the table [ tbl-3 ] these stars have published spectra ( in this work or elsewhere ) which are consistent with solar metallicity .",
    "therefore the combined correlation between absolute magnitude and spectral type of @xcite and @xcite , for low mass field stars of intermediate disk age and solar metallicity , will suffice to confidently predict secondary masses .",
    "the final step is to combine the empirical and semiempirical relations of figures [ fig56 ] & [ fig57 ] into figure [ fig58 ] , which shows the resulting correlation between spectral type and mass .",
    "figure [ fig59 ] is a histogram of the number of detections versus companion mass , using the correlation data in figure [ fig58 ] .",
    "when considering the overall survey mass sensitivity , for low mass stellar companions , age is not an issue .",
    "but for substellar objects , determination of mass sensitivity must include an age estimate . in ",
    "3.3 a likely age range for the sample was estimated to be @xmath51 gyr based on the overall kinematics and cooling ages , but owing to model grid availability and to avoid additional interpolation errors , calculations were performed for ages of 1 and 5 gyr .",
    "the average distance for the sample , calculated to be 57 pc in table [ tbl-2 ] , along with the models of @xcite , was used for determining overall mass completeness .",
    "obviously , the sensitivity differs for objects which are closer or farther and the standard deviation of the entire sample is significant at @xmath147 pc .",
    "yet the masses , temperatures and spectral classes implied by the completeness limits for each phase of the survey ( at the average distance of the sample stars ) epitomize what was detectable .",
    "table [ tbl-7 ] summarizes these completeness limits .",
    "@xcite report a completeness down to @xmath148 mag .",
    "however , this completeness was limited by single detectors prior to the availability of near - infrared cameras @xcite .",
    "all of the objects in table [ tbl-1 ] that were observed in the irtf survey were imaged with arrays . for spatially resolved objects ,",
    "a conservative completeness limit for these observations is @xmath149 mag . applying this limit at @xmath150 pc for the 84 white dwarfs observed in this early part of the survey ( but not reobserved at steward or keck ) ,",
    "these observations were complete to @xmath151 mag .",
    "this corresponds to a spectral type near l6 , @xmath152 k , and @xmath153 @xmath1 for @xmath154 gyr @xcite .",
    "gd 165b was discovered amongst the first observations in the program at @xmath155 mag and has a mass estimated at @xmath156 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the steward survey of 261 white dwarfs was complete to @xmath157 mag , implying a completeness down to @xmath158 mag at @xmath150 pc .",

    "the keck survey of 86 white dwarfs was complete to @xmath35 mag , implying completeness to @xmath161 mag at @xmath150 pc .",
    "this corresponds to spectral types later than t8 , @xmath162 k , and @xmath163 @xmath1 for @xmath154 gyr @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in  2.5 , all 371 sample stars were searched for near - infrared excess emission between @xmath122 @xmath15 m using the 2mass all sky catalog database @xcite .",
    "2mass provides a highly accurate , uniform and consistent method for this type of search .",
    "higher sensitivity to unresolved companions was not gained at keck or steward for two reasons : ( 1 ) the white dwarf was sometimes saturated in the attempt to image faint companions , especially at keck , and ( 2 ) near - infrared excess detection requires photometric accuracy , not deep imaging .",
    "the average temperature of a white dwarf in the sample is @xmath164 k. this yields @xmath165 mag , @xmath166 mag for a white dwarf of typical mass ( log @xmath167 , @xcite ) .",
    "the 2mass all sky catalog provides reliable photometry ( @xmath34 ) down to @xmath168 mag and @xmath169 mag for 100% of the sky and to @xmath170 mag and @xmath171 mag for 50% of the sky @xcite .    taking the average of these @xmath31 & @xmath172 limiting magnitudes at 57 pc",
    ", an excess of 170% above the white flux would be detectable at @xmath173 mag ( @xmath174 mag ) .",
    "this yields @xmath175 mag for a cool companion , which is around spectral type l4 .",
    "however , the sensitivity to excess emission is much greater at @xmath31 . at 57 pc ,",
    "an excess of 21% is detectable at @xmath176 mag ( @xmath177 mag ) , which yields @xmath178 mag for a low mass companion .",
    "this corresponds to spectral type l8 , @xmath179 k , and @xmath180 @xmath1 for @xmath154 gyr @xcite .",
    "the case of gd 1400b proves this point .",
    "estimated at spectral type l6 , it was detected using the 2mass database in a manner identical to that performed for all 371 stars in the entire sample .",
    "not included in the sample , gd 1400b was first identified by @xcite in the initial phase of a search utilizing the 2mass point source catalog to survey the entire sky near the positions of all white dwarfs in @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to distinguish gd 1400 from the bulk of white dwarfs with near - infrared excess emission and identify its companion .",
    "none of the searches were sensitive to companions beyond the field of view of the corresponding cameras . for the irtf ,",
    "only objects within @xmath181 of the white dwarf were detectable .",
    "the nirc and steward near - infrared camera fields of view are @xmath182 and @xmath183 from center to edge , respectively .",
    "this implies for targets at @xmath184 , separations out to @xmath185 au were probed by the steward survey , but only out to @xmath186 au for the keck survey .",
    "although wider binaries may have been missed in the keck and irtf searches , they would have been picked up by the dss blinks (  2.6 ) , unless they were spectral type l or later , roughly speaking .    generally speaking",
    ", m and l dwarfs were detectable at arbitrarily close physical separations (  4.2 ) .",
    "however , t dwarfs are generally not detectable by near - infrared excess unless the white dwarf is quite cool or quite massive ( @xmath187 k for log @xmath167 , or @xmath188 k for log @xmath189 ) .",
    "there were few stars in the sample meeting this criteria and therefore t dwarfs were only detectable if resolved ; at keck this required a separation on the sky of @xmath190 ( with typical mauna kea seeing ) and at steward @xmath191 ( typical kitt peak seeing ) .",
    "however , no t dwarfs were detected .",
    "on the brighter side , unresolved dwarf stellar companions earlier than around m1 ( @xmath192 mag ) were almost certainly selected against . depending on the luminosity of the white dwarf",
    ", it is possible for a g@xmath136k dwarf or even an m0 dwarf to mask the presence of a nearby degenerate at optical wavelengths .",
    "these types of binaries are likely selected against in surveys which identify and catalog nearby white dwarfs .",
    "this explains in part the drop off at the higher mass end of figures [ fig54 ] & [ fig59 ] .",
    "however , the study was not biased against wide yellow dwarf companions and two of the white dwarfs in the sample were found to have such secondaries .      in order to measure the initial mass function for companions to intermediate mass stars ,",
    "a critical question remains : are the red dwarf masses observed today the same as the initial masses when the binary was formed ?",
    "when intermediate mass main sequence stars , the progenitors of white dwarfs , ascend the asymptotic giant branch , their outer regions expand by a factor of a few hundred .",
    "if such a star has a relatively close main sequence companion within this region ( @xmath193 au ) , the pair is said to share a common envelope .",
    "generally speaking , such a close binary pair will transfer much of its orbital energy ( via angular momentum ) into the common envelope through friction , resulting in ejection of the envelope from the system and an inspiral to a more negative binary binding energy and smaller separation @xcite .",
    "it has been theorized that a low mass companion may accrete up to 70% of its final mass during a common envelope phase or may evaporate completely during the inspiral , depending on the initial masses and separations of both components @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a possibility that the masses of red dwarf secondaries in close binaries are not their initial masses .",
    "unforunately , there is no consensus on the topic .",
    "there appears to be evidence in support of the idea that secondaries do accrete a significant amount of mass during the common envelope phase @xcite .",
    "yet there also appears to be evidence that low mass companions emerge unaffected @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl-8 ] presents the median spectral types in this survey for several different low mass companion subgroups .",
    "the `` resolved '' subgroup refers to all resolved binary companions .",
    "the `` close '' subgroup is all known radial velocity binary companions  these are the post common envelope binaries .",
    "the `` unresolved / not close '' subgroup is all unresolved binary companions that are not known to be radial velocity variables .",
    "hence this subgroup contains an unknown number of post common envelope binaries .",
    "the fourth subgroup supposes that subgroup three binaries are all wide ( @xmath194 au ) , whereas the fifth subgroup supposes that subgroup three binaries are all close ( @xmath195 au ) .",
    "do the table [ tbl-8 ] values provide any evidence that post common envelope binary secondaries have accreted a significant amount of mass ( correlated here with spectral type ) ?",
    "if so , it is not obvious ( the interested reader is referred to farihi 2004b for further discussion ) .",
    "together , the various phases of this survey discovered over 40 previously unrecognized white dwarf binary and multiple systems . the wide field , common proper motion survey alone discovered at least 20 new white dwarf multiple systems . based on the analysis of  5.4 , there is no reason why all unevolved companion stars should not be included in the initial mass function .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that none of the 371 survey stars were found to have near - infrared excess similar to g29 - 38 and gd 362  the only two single white dwarfs known to be orbited by circumstellar dust @xcite .    before making an estimate of the substellar companion fraction , gd",
    "1400b must be discussed .",
    "although not included in the sample , it is an important datum in the overall statistics of low mass companions to white dwarfs  a long , hard , and much sought after datum ( 16 years passed between the discoveries of the first and second l dwarf companions to white dwarfs ) .",
    "gd 1400 is a white dwarf not unlike the sample white dwarfs , with @xmath196 k and a moderate proper motion of @xmath197 @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "hence its inclusion here is perfectly consistent with the sample stars , the search methods and resultant sensitivities (  5.3 ) . due to these consistencies and the fact that gd 1400b is a vital statistic ,",
    "it has been included in the analyses and conclusions .",
    "the calculated fraction of white dwarfs with substellar companions , within the range of masses and separations to which this work was sensitive , is @xmath199% .",
    "this represents the first measurement of the low mass tail of the companion mass function for intermediate mass stars , main sequence a and f stars ( plus relatively few b stars ) with masses in the range 1.2 @xmath1 @xmath200 @xmath1 .",
    "this value is consistent with similar searches around solar type main sequence stars for comparable sensitivities in mass and separation @xcite .",

    "it has spectral type m2 and @xmath202 mag @xcite .",
    "a main sequence m2 star has @xmath203 mag and hence g187 - 9 is subluminous , and by definition a subdwarf .",

    "it has @xmath205 , which is too red for a single hot helium burning star .",

    "the spectrum of pg 0009 + 191 appears to be that of a hot subdwarf , type sdb @xcite      pg 1126 + 185 is classified as type dc8 @xcite .",
    "it was reclassified as dc+g / k by @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to detect a dc star ( cool helium atmosphere or very cool hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf ) around a main sequence g or k star , since the difference in brightness at @xmath67 would be at least 6 magnitudes .",
    "were it not for the blue continuum , the spectrum in figure 2 of @xcite makes a great case for a metal - poor nondegenerate star ; weak lines of mg , fe , na can be seen in addition to balmer lines and ca h & k. photometry done here gives @xmath206 , which is consistent with a g / k type star .",

    "have measured a zero parallax for pg 1126 + 185  clearly inconsistent with a white dwarf , given its relative brightness at @xmath208 mag .",
    "to explain both the blue continuum and the observed absorption features of pg 1126 + 185 , a composite system consisting of one hot star and one cool star is needed .",
    "the luminosities should be comparable given the spectrum .",
    "a typical g star has @xmath209 mag , but is there a hot star that has a comparable absolute @xmath67 magnitude ?",
    "subdwarf b stars have @xmath210 mag @xcite . therefore , the most likely explanation for the spectrum of pg 1126 + 185 is a composite binary consisting of an sdb+g / k .",
    "this is also consistent with the zero parallax measurement .",
    "pg 0210 + 168 shares a story similar to pg 1126 + 185 .",
    "it was typed dc originally @xcite and then reclassified as dc+f / g by @xcite .",
    "again , it is simply not possible to detect a dc white dwarf in the optical against the flux of an f or g star . in this case",
    "the brightness difference would be at least 8 magnitudes .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite clearly shows weak metal lines , a balmer series , plus ca h & k. its spectrum is very similar to that of pg 1126 + 185 and shows a strong blue continuum as well .",
    "pg 0210 + 168 was not observed for optical photometry in the course of this work , so its @xmath211 colors are not known , but with @xmath212 , it is quite certain that pg 0210 + 168 contains a cool star together with a hot star .",
    "following the same reasoning as for pg 1126 + 185 , the conclusion is that it is very likely an sdb+f / g composite binary .",
    "measuring proper motion accurately is a nontrivial task requiring good s / n on dozens if not hundreds of background , near zero motion sources . and",
    "still , what is almost always measured is relative proper motion  that is , the motion of an object relative to nearby stationary sources @xcite . in identification of common proper motion companions ,",
    "this issue is not really important .",
    "a wide binary pair should have the same absolute and relative proper motion , assuming zero orbital motion .",
    "however , the issues raised in  4.3 are valid and do contribute to measurement uncertainties . given the limited accuracy of the proper motions measured for this work , many candidates were flagged which turned out to be background stars .",
    "this is desireable  the error was on the side of caution and real candidates were not thrown out .    in the end , only reliable trigonometric parallaxes and/or orbital motion can determine binarity in widely separated pairs with absolute certainty .",
    "this is illustrated by three white dwarf target primaries in the sample : g47 - 18 , g66 - 36 , & g116 - 16 .",
    "all three of these stars are reported to be members of a wide binary containing a white dwarf in @xcite .",
    "however , further investigation proves these cases to be false positives .",

    "g66 - 36 was reported as a common proper motion binary with the g5 dwarf g66 - 35 @xcite .",
    "however , g66 - 36 is not a white dwarf but a metal - poor m2 star at @xmath225 pc @xcite .",
    "its proper motion is @xmath226 @xmath198 at @xmath227 @xcite , while g66 - 35 has @xmath228 @xmath198 at @xmath229 and @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that this is a case of a subdwarf being mistaken for a white dwarf and two stars with different proper motion being identified as companions .",
    "motions in the galactic disk are primarily responsible for the proper motion of nearby stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , in principle , two unrelated stars can have nearly identical proper motions , both in magnitude and direction .",
    "in addition , some proper motion confusion is due to limited measurement accuracy , as exemplified in  a.2 .",
    "unlike the objects in the previous section , the following potential candidate wide binaries have never appeared in the literature .      in early 2002 ,",
    "a candidate common proper motion companion to the dc5 white dwarf gd 248 was identified .",
    "a measurement utilizing digitized poss plates separated by nearly 40 years seemed to indicate common proper motion .",
    "another measurement using near - infrared images separated by almost 5 years gave similar results but with uncertainty three times as large .",
    "a keck lris spectrum @xcite covering @xmath231   revealed na at 5880  , a strong mgh band at 5100  , and a variety of other fairly weak features  all indicative of a metal - poor late k or very early m star @xcite .",
    "thus , the candidate companion to gd 248 is an ultrahigh velocity background star . at an estimated distance of @xmath232 pc ( assuming @xmath233 mag , 2 magnitudes below the main sequence for spectral type k7 ) , its tangential velocity of @xmath234 km @xmath235 is just under the escape velocity of the galaxy @xcite . a precise proper motion measurement has been performed on the nonphysical pair and their error ellipses differ by exactly @xmath236 @xmath198 ( s. lpine 2002 , private communication ) .        ultimately , spectra revealed @xcite that the candidate companions to pg 1026 + 002 , & pg 1038 + 633 were high velocity background stars of similar temperature to the candidate companion to gd 248 .",
    "the candidate companion to gd 304 has a much redder @xmath95 color than the other three objects in table [ tbl-9 ] .    assuming @xmath237 mag ( 1 magnitude below the main sequence for spectral type m0 ) for the candidate companion to pg 1026 + 002 , its tangential velocity is @xmath238 km @xmath235 . using @xmath239 mag for the candidate companion to pg 1038 + 633 ( 1 magnitude below the main sequence for a k7 star ) , its tangential velocity is @xmath240 km @xmath235 .",

    "a spectrum was a critical discriminant .",
    "these objects show common proper motion of varying degree of agreement along with colors and/or spectra consistent with companionship .",
    "data for candidate companions are listed in tables [ tbl-3 ] , [ tbl-4 ] , [ tbl-5 ] , & [ tbl-10 ] .",
    "gd 84b is an especially tentative companion due to the relative lack of agreement in the measured proper motions .",
    "a more precise measurement could not be made for the candidate companion because it is passing in front of another star in the digitized poss i scans .",
    "this candidate is retained because it and gd 84 have similar photometric distances .",
    "@xcite give spectral type dq5.6 for gd 84 ( @xmath243 k ) , which yields @xmath244 mag and a photometric distance of @xmath245 pc for log @xmath167 .",
    "the m dwarf , verified by its optical spectrum in figures [ fig38 ] & [ fig39 ] , appears to be a normal solar metallicity star .",

    "because of this discrepancy , a ( less accurate ) measurement was made for this work ( table [ tbl-10 ] )",
    ".    furthermore , with @xmath249 mag from table [ tbl-4 ] and @xmath250 mag for spectral type m2 ( solar metallicity ) , the photometric distance to gd 683b is @xmath251 pc .",
    "there exist two temperature and surface gravity determinations for the da white dwarf gd 683 ; their average gives @xmath252 k and log @xmath253 , which imply @xmath254 mag and a photometric distance of @xmath255 pc , consistent with companionship between the pair .",
    "pg 0933 + 729b is retained as a candidate because there currently exists no optical photometric nor spectroscopic data .",
    "the photographic magnitudes , @xmath256 mag , @xmath257 mag in the usno catalog , together with the near - infrared magnitudes in table [ tbl-5 ] , imply a @xmath95 color of an early m dwarf ( type m2 or earlier ) and a photometric distance @xmath258 pc .",
    "the white dwarf is type da3 , @xmath259 k at @xmath260 pc @xcite .",
    "new information gleaned in this work  specifically , data on previously unknown companions  provides more accurate descriptions and parameterizations of many single and a few double degenerates . in several cases of confirmed white dwarf plus red dwarf binaries ,",
    "the photometric distance to the white dwarf does not agree with the photometric distance to the red dwarf . in cases where the red dwarf appears overluminous ,",
    "this may be explained by binarity .",
    "however , there are several cases where the red dwarf appears significantly underluminous .",
    "although a metal - poor m companion would be subluminous with respect to the main sequence , it is more likely that the distance to the white dwarf is inaccurate as none of the m dwarf companions appear to have metal - poor spectra .",
    "g21 - 15 is a triple degenerate , only the second known .",
    "its hierarchy is similar to the only other known triple degenerate ( wd 1704 + 481 ; @xcite ) , with one close double degenerate @xcite plus the widely separated cool white dwarf reported here .",

    "hence it is possible that the close binary consists of two low mass , he core white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the spectroscopy , photometry , and parallax . but this fails to correctly predict the single lined da nature of the system , unless one of the stars is a yet undetected db , which is unlikely @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is two white dwarfs with different luminosities  some combination of different masses and temperatures .",
    "is there a scenario which is consistent with all the observations ?",
    "the answer is yes . in order to display a single lined da spectrum with a 6.27 d period ,",
    "whose balmer line profiles yield log @xmath271 , @xmath270 @xmath1 , one needs a relatively low mass hot component and a relatively high mass cool component .",

    "therefore the most likely nature of the double degenerate is a he core and a co core white dwarf .",
    "the optical and near - infrared colors of g21 - 15c ( table [ tbl-5 ] ) are consistent with a helium atmosphere ( it is too red for a hydrogen atmosphere ) degenerate with @xmath279 k. the trigonometric parallax gives @xmath280 mag and indicates a radius corresponding to log @xmath281 , or @xmath282 @xmath1 .",
    "the cooling age of a helium atmosphere white dwarf with such parameters is 6.6 gyr .",
    "its kinematics are consistent with a disk star of age @xmath283 gyr ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that such an old disk white dwarf is not more massive than @xmath282 @xmath1 .",
    "if correct , this implies the total age of g21 - 15c , and hence the entire system , is likely to be closer to 8 gyr .",
    "the initial to final mass relation for white dwarfs indicates that degenerate stars less massive than 0.6 @xmath1 have descended from main sequence progenitors less massive than 2 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such a progenitor should have had a main sequence lifetime of more than 1.5 gyr @xcite , yielding a total age for g21 - 15c of @xmath284 gyr .    designating the brighter ,",
    "he core white dwarf g21 - 15a and the fainter , putative co core white dwarf g21 - 15b , the cooling age of g21 - 15c can be used as a constraint on the overall age of the system and place upper limits to the masses of both main sequence progenitor components of the double degenerate . using @xmath277 k for g21 - 15a and @xmath285 k for g21 - 15b",
    ", they have been cooling for 0.1 and 0.6 gyr respectively .",
    "if the above analysis is correct , the entire system is at least 8.1 gyr old and hence the progenitors of g21 - 15a & b were very nearly solar mass stars @xcite .",
    "a he core white dwarf is born as it ascends the red giant branch for the first time , its outer layers stripped before helium burning can begin @xcite .",
    "g21 - 15a began this ascent after at least 8 gyr on the main sequence , corresponding to a star with @xmath286 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "g21 - 15b completed its main sequence evolution 0.5 gyr before component a became a red giant , and hence came from a slightly more massive progenitor with @xmath287 @xmath1 @xcite .    now a complete picture , albeit speculative , of the entire evolution of the double degenerate can emerge .",
    "the progenitors of g21 - 15a & b were probably two nearly solar mass stars with separation @xmath288 au . the more massive component b left the main sequence first , without any mass transfer in the relatively wide binary during its first red giant phase .",
    "upon ascending the asymptotic giant branch , component b forms a common envelope around the binary and the orbit shrinks significantly due to loss of angular momentum .",
    "the resulting close separation is enough to cause component a to overfill its roche lobe as a first ascent giant and become a he core white dwarf @xcite .",

    "<S> additionally , all white dwarf targets were examined for near - infrared excess emission , a technique capable of detecting companions at arbitrarily close separations down to masses of 0.05 @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> no brown dwarf candidates were detected , which implies a brown dwarf companion fraction of @xmath3% for white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the stellar companion fraction of white dwarfs as measured by this survey is 22% , uncorrected for bias . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , most of the known and suspected stellar companions to white dwarfs are low mass stars whose masses are only slightly greater than the masses of brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> twenty previously unknown stellar companions were detected , five of which are confirmed or likely white dwarfs themselves , while fifteen are confirmed or likely low mass stars .    </S>",
    "<S> similar to the distribution of cool field dwarfs as a function of spectral type , the number of cool unevolved dwarf companions peaks at mid - m type . </S>",
    "<S> based on the present work , relative to this peak , field l dwarfs appear to be roughly @xmath4 times more abundant than companion l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , there is no evidence that the initial companion masses have been altered by post main sequence binary interactions </S>"
