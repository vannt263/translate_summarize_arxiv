    "the likelihood is guaranteed to increase at each iteration of this process ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . moreover , for a compact set of parameters the algorithm converges to a critical point of the likelihood function .",

    "the number @xmath59 of free parameters for transition matrices in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath8 models is 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 12 respectively .",

    "the output of this software is the alignment , the substitution matrices , root distribution",
    "( whenever non - stationary ) and the variances of the continuous free parameters .",
    "we note that for the @xmath9 model , there is a @xmath107 correspondence between the branch length and the free parameters of the substitution matrix .",
    "this does not hold for other models , were different substiution matrices may give the same branch length .",

    "it is known that in certain cases the substitution parameters are not identifiable ( e.g. parameters at the edges adjacent to the root of valency 2 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the @xmath8 model and its submodels , are identifiable up to a permutation of rows .",
    "@xcite showed that incorrect order of rows in the matrices can lead to a negative determinant of the substitution matrix from which the branch lengths can not be calculated .",
    "we expected this problem to arise in short data sets and large branch length , as those correspond to the substitution matrices with smaller diagonal value .",
    "for all the data sets used for tests , we calculated the percentage of cases among the 1,000 simulations for which the parameters estimated by the em algorithm were permuted .",
    "this phenomenon was only observed in the data sets of @xmath113 and @xmath111 . in the first case ,",
    "the estimated matrices were permuted when the initial branch length was 0.55 or longer and corresponded to 0.005 - 0.023@xmath114 of the cases ; in the latter , for the branches of 0.6 or longer with at most 0.001@xmath114 permuted matrices .",
    "shorter branch lengths and longer alignments did not suffer from the above problem and recovered the underlying order in all of the cases .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the entries of the diagonal largest in column ( dlc ) substitution matrices are identifiable .",
    "namely , there exists a unique set of substitution matrices satisfying the dlc condition and a unique root distribution that leads to a given joint distribution at the leaves . in order to ensure the reliability of the results we designed a procedure that scans the tree in the search of the permutations that maximize the number of substitution matrices with larger diagonal entries .",
    "it is not possible to maximize it for all edges , thus the goal is to find the permutations giving more weights to the lower parts of the tree , starting with the nodes corresponding to the outer branches . given a tree @xmath1 , we choose an interior node to be the root , directing all edges outwards . for each interior node @xmath23",
    ", we apply a permutation @xmath115 of @xmath21 that maximizes the sum of diagonal entries of the matrices assigned to the outgoing edges of @xmath23 .",
    "permutations @xmath115 are applied recursively to the subtrees of @xmath1 , moving @xmath23 from the outer nodes towards the root .",
    "we present the results on the simulated data sets and discuss their dependence on the length of the alignments , the length of the branches and the depth of the branches in the tree1 for the external branches and 2 for the internal branches @xcite . in cases with multiple branches of equal depth",

    "each sample gave rise to a @xmath78 based on the @xmath116 test given by .",

    "the error is about 0.2 . in the case of branches of depth 2 , it is almost doubled for both alignment lengths . in both cases , branch lengths up to 0.5 give satisfactory results .",
    "the error of the estimates for longer branches seems to be approaching a plateau .",
    "combined variance of the estimated parameters is much decreased for the @xmath132nt data sets in comparison with the @xmath112nt , and is smaller for the depth 1 branch ( see fig .",
    "again , the exponential shape of the plot can be attributed to the logarithm appearing in the formula .",
    "in order to evaluate the performance of the method proposed here under various circumstances , we conducted many tests on simulated data sets .",
    "we observed that the performance of @xmath0 is most optimal for long alignments and short branch lengths .",

    "moreover , the branch lengths calculated based on the parameters estimated by @xmath0 were found very accurate already for short alignments . though the measure of divergence @xmath44 for the parameters of transition matrices proposed here accumulates all errors in the entries of the transition matrix , alignment length of 10,000nt showed divergence values smaller than 0.1 .    in this paper",
