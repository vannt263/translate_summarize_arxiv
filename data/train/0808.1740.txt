    "one of the main scientific goals of the recently - launched @xmath2ray astronomy satellite mission glast and its large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite is to shed light on the nature of powerful relativistic extragalactic jets , which are ejected from the nuclei of some active galaxies ( agn ) . originally , this class of agn was defined based on the bright and prominent radio emission from these jets : the radio - loud population of active galaxies . based on data from egret , the high - energy @xmath2ray telescope on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ , it was realized @xcite that the largest population of extragalactic @xmath2ray sources in the gev regime is represented by those radio - loud agn whose",
    "jets are pointed at a small angle to the line of sight .",
    "an intimate link is tied between radio vlbi and high - energy @xmath2ray astronomy by the fact that the bright compact radio emission of these so - called blazars provides excellent targets for parsec - scale resolution vlbi observations of their jet structure .    of special interest",
    "are the questions of where in the agn jets the bright @xmath2ray emission is produced , and how the emission is interacting with its immediate environment and with other parts of the jet .",
    "this knowledge would enable us to put crucial constraints on the processes of jet formation , collimation , and acceleration .",
    "glast is expected to yield densely sampled @xmath2ray light curves of hundreds of extragalactic jets that are bright enough to be detected on time scales of days to weeks , and thousands on time scales of months to years .",
    "most of these objects will be blazars ; in fact , all but two of the firmly identified extragalactic egret sources ( lmc , sreekumar et al . 1992",
    "; centaurusa , sreekumar et al .",
    "1999 ) are blazars .",
    "in contrast to the blazars , most radio galaxies have larger inclination angles . that allows better ( deprojected ) linear resolution with vlbi observations , and in the case of stratified jet structures , it allows observations of the slower jet layers , e.g. a sheath , whose emission may be swamped by the much brighter beamed emission from faster jet regions , e.g. a fast spine , in blazars . @xcite",
    "have presented such a spine - sheath stratified - jet model , predicting detectable @xmath2ray emission from the nuclei of some radio galaxies . in their model , each of the two emission regions sees photons coming from the other part relativistically enhanced because of the relative speed difference , giving rise to an additional inverse - compton emission component .    in this letter",
    "we provide additional support for the identification of the broad - line radio galaxy 3c111 as a @xmath2ray source , responsible for a portion of the source 3egj0416 + 3650 .",
    "such an association was suggested as possible in the third egret catalog @xcite , but was considered unlikely because of the large positional offset of 3c111 from 3egj0416 + 3650 .",
    "the present work was stimulated by the recent report of @xcite , who used multiwavelength data to strengthen the case for the association between 3c111 and 3egj0416 + 3650 .",
    "we show here that 3egj0416 + 3650 is most likely composed of at least two , and more likely three , separate sources , one of which is in good positional agreement with 3c111 . as demonstrated recently , based on vlba monitoring data at @xmath5 cm from the mojave program @xcite , the parsec - scale jet of 3c111 shows a variety of physically different regions in a relativistic extragalactic jet , such as a compact core , superluminal jet components , recollimation shocks , and regions of interaction between the jet and its surrounding medium , which are all possible sites of @xmath2ray production .",
    "its relatively large inclination angle of @xmath619@xmath1 makes 3c111 a particularly well - suited target for tests of structured - jet models , such as the model of @xcite .",
    "we describe our re - analysis of the available egret data on 3c111 , as well as follow - up _ swift _ ovot and xrt observation , in sect .",
    "[ sect : analysis ] , and discuss our results and their implications in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "using detailed analysis of reprocessed egret data1000mev which had previously been rejected , adding a considerable number of events to the database ; 2 ) adjustment of the egret sensitivity tables @xcite ; 3 ) complete re - analysis of one viewing period ( not used here ) because of numerous errors in the original event selection . ]",
    ", we have investigated the possibility that 3egj0416 + 3650 is a superposition of at least two sources , one being at or near the position of 3c111 .",
    "the analysis for the 3eg catalog was based on photons with energies @xmath4100mev , for which the 68% containment angle of the spectrum - dependent point spread function ( psf ) is always several degrees . for energies",
    "@xmath41000mev , the half - angle of the cone containing 68% of the photons from a source is considerably smaller , slightly less than one degree . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of photons with energies above 1000mev is much smaller than that above 100mev .",
    "both of those integral energy ranges were investigated for this study .    for each viewing period ( vp )",
    "in which 3c111 and 3egj0416 + 3650 were in the egret field of view ( fov ) , the following procedure was initially used :    1 .   using the standard egret likelihood software ( like ) ,",
    "two sources were modeled , one at the 3eg position for 3egj0416 + 3650 and one at the nominal position of 3c111 , and like then provided the best estimates of the significance and flux of the two assumed sources .",
    "2 .   if either of the two assumed sources had a test statistic ( ts ) of at least 4.0 ( roughly 2@xmath3 ) , like was then allowed to optimize the significance of the two sources by moving their positions .",
    "the results from this procedure are shown in table  [ tab : decomposition ] , for the two energy ranges and the two assumed sources .",
    "the first five columns show the vps , the starting dates of the observations , the lengths of the vps , and the off - axis angles of 3c111 .",
    "the line showing vp = p1234 is the analysis of the summed data for the vps included in 3eg , vp0002 through vp4270 . for each object and energy range ,",
    "the table shows the maximum ts near the starting position , the change in position ( from the starting point ) to obtain the maximum ts , and the resulting photon flux in units of @xmath7 photons@xmath8s@xmath9 .",
    "blank entries for ts indicate values of 0 . for ts values less than 4.0 , there are no entries in the next two columns .",
    "in addition to the vps listed , vps 0005 , 0010 , 0365 , 2130 , 2210 , 4120 , and 4260 were tested , and showed no indication ( ts=0 ) of emission from either 3c111 or 3egj0416 + 3650 ; vp0390 also showed ts=0 , but is shown in the table because it was the best exposure to the relevant sky region .",
    "for the cases where the offsets are small compared with the psf , there is little difference in the ts and flux at the maximum ts positions compared with those at the original positions .    considering that seven vps are not shown because they yielded ts=0 for all four source / energy cases , the density of detections in this table is very low , even with the low requirement of ts@xmath104.0 .",
    "one of the 3c111 detections ( vp0150 for e@xmath41000mev ) has an offset position value larger than would be expected , and out of line with the other detections .",
    "it is discussed below .",
    "two vps ( 0002 and 3211 ) provide reasonably strong detection of 3egj0416 + 3650 , which agrees with the information provided in 3eg .",
    "the summed exposure p1234 provides nearly the same significance of detection ( but a much lower average flux than in vps 0002 and 3211 ) , indicating that the object was emitting @xmath2 rays at a low level even when it was not significantly detectable in individual vps .",
    "there are five results that support the proposed 3c111 @xmath2ray source , two in e@xmath4100mev and three in e@xmath41000mev . with the exception of vp0150 at @xmath41000mev , the values of the position offsets are compatible with the position of 3c111 .",
    "only one vp ( 0310 ) shows detections in both energy ranges . like 3egj0416 + 3650",
    ", 3c111 appears to radiate @xmath2 rays with a low duty cycle , occasionally becoming fairly bright .",
    "the number of photons @xmath4100mev from 3c111 was 64 , 44 of them in vp0310 and 14 in vp3215 .",
    "only about 20 photons @xmath41000mev were detected from 3c111 , six in vp0150 , four in vp0310 , and four in vp3250 .    for 3egj0416 + 3650",
    ", there was a total of 152 photons @xmath4100mev , 37 of them in vp3211 ( the most significant single detection ) and 33 in vp0002 .",
    "p1234 yielded seven photons above 1000mev from 3egj0416 + 3650 , but as indicated in table 1 , they produced a ts of only 3.1 , about 1.8@xmath3 .",
    "we have further investigated a small region around 3egj0416 + 3650 by generating @xmath11 likelihood maps , for the energy ranges @xmath4100mev and @xmath41000mev , for each vp in which 3c111 and 3egj0416 + 3650 were in the fov .",
    "a sample of the more informative likelihood maps is shown in figure 1 .",
    "maps for the summed data , p1234 , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the contours in the upper ( @xmath4100mev ) half of figure 2 are similar to those in the corresponding figure from 3eg , but in the current version , the extension toward the 3c111 position is more pronounced .",
    "we draw the following conclusions from these maps :    1 .   there appear to be at least three sources ( possibly more ) contributing , two in the @xmath41000mev energy range and at least one in the @xmath4100mev range .",
    "one of the two @xmath41000mev sources is very near the position of 3c111 ; for the other , which is of comparable strength , we find no obvious identification ( see below ) . in the following ,",
    "we designate this source groj0426 + 3747 ; as seen from figure 2 , the 68% confidence error on its position is about 0.8@xmath1 .",
    "2 .   little or no significant emission is detected from the two @xmath41000mev sources in the lower energy band .",
    "the @xmath4100mev emission is dominated by a source near the 3eg catalog position .",
    "there is no significant detection in the @xmath41000mev energy range . in the following ,",
    "the name 3egj0416 + 3650 refers implicitly to this source .",
    "the @xmath41000mev map for vp0150 shows why the position offset for 3c111 is so large ( 0.43@xmath1 ) in table 1 in that vp .",
    "there are only six photons that can be clearly attributed to 3c111 in that map .",
    "one additional photon is nearly a degree away from 3c111 .",
    "this shifts the maximum likelihood position toward that single photon , which could be either from the tail of the psf , or from the diffuse galactic foreground .",
    "3 ( anywhere in the map , either energy range ) .",
    "the left column panels are for e@xmath4100mev , while the right column panels show e@xmath41000mev , with fewer photons but a considerably smaller point spread function .",
    "crosses show the positions of 3c111 and 3egj0416 + 3650 ; ref .",
    "figure 2 . ]",
    "100mev ( top ) and @xmath41000mev ( bottom ) . on the scale used here ,",
    "the position of swiftj041554.3 + 364926 is almost indistinguishable from that of 3egj0416 + 3650 , and is therefore not shown . ]    as an additional check on the reality of the two @xmath41000mev sources , we have compared the number of occurrences of @xmath102@xmath3 excesses in 17 maps ( 5@xmath1 by 5@xmath1 ) with the statistically expected value .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "for the regions of the maps away from the two `` source '' positions , the number of @xmath42@xmath3 excesses is about as expected from statistical fluctuations , taking into account the number of psfs contained within each map . near the locations of the two @xmath41000mev sources ,",
    "however , there are far more excesses than expected , which provides added confidence in the detections of 3c111 and groj0426 + 3747 . for each of vps 0005 and 3215 ( which had very low exposures ) , there was exactly one photon detected in the 5@xmath1 x 5@xmath1 region for which the ts maps were generated .",
    "both of those photons were very close to the groj0426 + 3747 position obtained from the summed emission in p1234 , well within the 68% psf extent .",
    "an examination of a somewhat larger region indicated that the probability of a photon from the diffuse emission that close to a particular point was less than 0.01 .",
    "those two events are indicated with `` s '' in table 2 .      there are no known high - energy sources close to the nominal best - fit positions of 3egj0416 + 3650 and groj0426 + 3747 .",
    "therefore , we have conducted follow - up optical / uv and x  ray observations with the uvot and xrt instruments on the nasa satellite _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "the 3egj0416 + 3650 field was observed for 10.4ksec on december 14 , 2007 , and the groj0426 + 3747 field for 9.0ksec on 20 december , 2007 .",
    "no significant x  ray source was detected above the background level in the 23.6@xmath1223.6arcsec xrt fov around groj0416426 + 3747 .",
    "the xrt observation of the 3egj0416 + 3650 field detected one @xmath13 source at the position 04h 15 m 54.3s , + 36d 49 m 26s , with an uncertainty of 5.8 arcsec .",
    "we extracted spectra from the source ( which we designate swiftj041554.3 + 364926 ) and background regions using xselect , and response and ancillary files provided by the _",
    "calibration data base ( caldb ) .",
    "the low count rate of @xmath14cts+s@xmath9 limits the ability to derive spectral information .",
    "however , it is striking that only 4 photons ( out of 26 ) were detected between 0.2kev and 1kev . to characterize the spectrum , we used cash statistics ( cash 1979 ) in xspec and determined the maximum allowable power - law photon index in a power - law fit under the assumption of zero absorption , as may be expected from a very local source .",
    "the result is slightly dependent on the data binning chosen , but suggests a very hard spectrum , with the maximum allowed photon index in the range 1.1 - 1.3 .",
    "if the absorption parameter is allowed to vary freely during the fit , the photon index is poorly constrained , and steeper values up to 2.7 are statistically allowed .",
    "the historical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 3c111 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the millimeter flux range was determined with permission from the sma submillimeter calibrator list archived data @xcite .",
    "the r - band flux range has been determined from data obtained in a long - term monitoring program with the liverpool telescope ( pi : i. mchardy ) between november 2004 and july 2007 ( s. jorstad , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "the 3c111 sed is similar to those of egret - detected flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , except that the rollover in the nir , optical , and uv is steeper here .",
    "this makes the `` valley '' between the synchrotron and compton `` bumps '' appear deeper .",
    "this could be due to absorption intrinsic to 3c111 , since the data points have been corrected for galactic absorption .",
    "figure 4 shows ( a ) a uvot image of the swiftj041554.3 + 364926 region , with a circle superimposed indicating the 1@xmath3 position uncertainty for the x  ray source ( as determined with the ftools task xrtcentroid ) ; and ( b ) an sed containing the very limited multiwavelength data available for this source .",
    "the egret points shown are for comparison only ; despite its proximity to the 3eg position for the @xmath2ray source , it is not certain that swiftj041554.3 + 364926 is actually the same object as 3egj0416 + 3650 , because the egret position uncertainty is quite large ( about 0.63@xmath1 in radius ) .        in the swiftj041554.3 +",
    "364926 sed , the uvot data are plotted twice , with and without dereddening , because it is not certain whether the object is nearby or extragalactic .",
    "the open circles denote the observed fluxes ; the dereddened fluxes are shown as filled circles .",
    "note that the fall - off in the optical - uv is extremely steep , especially in the observed fluxes .",
    "if swiftj041554.3 + 364926 is an extragalactic source , this can be attributed to absorption at the edge of a foreground molecular cloud , part of the taurus complex , with absorbing column density @xmath15@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "ned shows @xmath16 of 1.893mag for the catalog position of the egret source , about 0.1@xmath1 away . in the extragalactic scenario , swiftj041554.3 + 364926",
    "must be a radio quiet source because of the very low upper limit on its radio flux density , 0.7 mjy at 1.4ghz , from the nvss survey @xcite .",
    "the shape of the dereddened uv / optical / ir range suggests an agn `` blue bump '' , usually attributed to thermal emission from an accretion disk .",
    "however , without far ir and/or submillimeter data points , it is not possible to be certain of this interpretation .",
    "based on previous experience , a radio - quiet agn is an unlikely identification for an egret source .    alternatively ,",
    "if swiftj041554.3 + 364926 is within our galaxy , it would need to be an m star or a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) in order to produce the observed x  rays ( r. osten and s. drake , priv . comm . ) . in order to be visible optically",
    ", an m star would necessarily be in front of the molecular cloud , which is 140pc distant @xcite , so the observed uvot data points should be considered , rather than the dereddened ones .",
    "the observed x ",
    "ray emission is stronger than expected from an m star except during an exceptional flare ( r. osten and s. drake , priv .",
    "if the object is a cv , its luminosity is much greater , so it must be behind the taurus absorber , making the dereddened uvot points appropriate ; in that case the x  ray emission is reasonable .",
    "based on previous experience , neither an m star or a cv would be a likely identification for an egret source .    table  [ tab:3c111_sed ] and table  [ tab : j0416_sed ] provide the values plotted in figures 3 and 4 , with references .",
    "the @xmath2ray source 3egj0416 + 3650 seems to be composed of at least three variable sources .",
    "one of the sources , detected only above 1000mev , is close to the radio galaxy 3c111 , and plausibly associated with it ; a new source , groj0426 + 3747 , is also seen only above 1000mev , and has no obvious identification at other wavelengths .",
    "most of the flux @xmath4100mev is from the third source , for which there is no evidence in the @xmath41000mev data .",
    "the position obtained here for the third source is very near the catalog position of 3egj0416 + 3650 .",
    "it might be associated with the xrt source swiftj041554.3 + 364926 , but the egret position uncertainty makes a firm association impossible .",
    "the region under study is @xmath17 from the galactic plane , so either 3egj0416 + 3650 or groj0426 + 3747 ( or both ) could be local .",
    "a recent stacking search found no evidence for @xmath2ray emmision from radio galaxies as a class @xcite . that paper specifically excluded 3c111 from consideration because of its blazar - like superluminal motion , so there is no direct conflict with the results presented here .",
    "that study made no systematic cut on the angle to the line - of - sight of the radio jet , so for most of the galaxies included , that angle was considerably larger than the @xmath619@xmath1 which has been estimated for 3c111 @xcite .",
    "since a larger line - of - sight angle implies substantially smaller doppler boosting and therefore lower @xmath2ray output , there is no obvious conflict between the present results and those of @xcite .",
    "a more significant challenge is posed by the lack of egret detection of @xmath2ray emission from the ( much closer ) agn m87 .",
    "superluminal motion has been detected in the jet knot hst-1 , about 0.86arcsec downstream from the radio core , both in the optical and radio bands @xcite .",
    "most estimates of our line - of - sight angle to its jet are in the range @xmath18 .",
    "if we assume that m87 is similar to 3c111 , it is not clear whether its doppler boosting is sufficiently low to compensate for its much smaller distance , and thereby account for its non - detection by egret .",
    "our re - analysis of the available egret data supports the previous association of the source 3egj0416 + 3650 with the broad line radio galaxy 3c111 , but with 3c111 responsible for only a portion of the @xmath2ray emission .",
    "furthermore , it explains the relatively large positional offset noted in @xcite .",
    "we have compiled an historical sed of 3c111 which shows that the x  ray data may well extrapolate into the egret range , particularly during flares , which is in agreement with the intermittent nature of detections in the individual egret viewing periods .",
    "it is interesting to note that we detect 3c111 at almost exactly the @xmath2ray flux that is predicted by equation ( 12 ) in @xcite : @xmath19ergs@xmath9@xmath8 , scaling from the 5ghz values in table  [ tab:3c111_sed ] .",
    "note that 3c111 ( z=0.0485 ) would be the most distant radio galaxy detected in @xmath2 rays , about twice as far as ngc6251 ( mukherjee et al .",
    "2002 ; z=0.0247 ) .",
    "the detection of @xmath2ray emission from 3c111 further supports the hypothesis that radio galaxies may represent an important class of lat sources .",
    "glast was launched on 11 june , 2008 ; its lat detector will continuously scan the entire sky over a 3-hr interval . with a factor of 30 greater sensitivity",
    "than egret , and with a factor of @xmath63 better psf above 1gev , it will be more efficient than egret for detecting transients over the whole sky . in the case of 3c111 , groj0426 + 3747 , and 3egj0416 + 3650 , the smaller psf and greater effective area of the lat will clearly separate these three sources .",
