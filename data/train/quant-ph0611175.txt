    "all these findings lead us to conclude that in all likelihood at long times the matter - field system is only weakly classically correlated .",
    "we summarize this section by stating that at short times ( @xmath109 ) , when the partial entropies are oscillatory ( see bottom of fig .",
    "[ edjcmentropy ] ) , the matter - field system is entangled , as verified by the negative conditional entropies and the negative partially transposed full density matrix . however , as dissipation sets in , the matter - field system becomes less and less entangled . at @xmath94 ,",
    "when the partial entropies are not oscillating any more , the matter - field system in all likelihood is not entangled ( as verified by the positive conditional entropies and the positive partially transposed full density matrix ) , and the overall rise in entropy is attributed to the dissipative lindblad super operator .",

    "we show that at steady state , when the main entropy production is due to heat fluxes from / to the heat reservoirs , carnot s efficiency formula is obtained in differential form .",
    "a strong motivation for this work comes from an early paper by scovil and schulz - dubois @xcite in which they analyze a three - level maser as a heat engine . in their work , they intuitively defined the engine s efficiency as the ratio between the maser frequency and the pumping frequency .",

    "<S> we show that after an initial transient time the field s entropy rises linearly during the operation of the engine , which we attribute to the dissipative nature of the evolution and not to matter - field entanglement . </S>",
