    "baryon resonances represent an important part of the hadronic spectrum which in turn reflects the pattern of excitations above the qcd ground state . their experimental investigation proceeds with various probes ,",
    "e.g. , in photo- or electro - production processes at nucleons or nuclei .",
    "also in hadronic reactions the baryon resonances play an important role .",
    "the theoretical investigation is based on coupled channel analyses , effective field theories , chiral perturbation theory , qcd sum rules etc .",
    "the resonances once excited decay under emission of hadrons , real or virtual photons .",
    "the decay channels we here focus on are such ones where light vector mesons are emitted .",
    "an understanding of the elementary hadronic production processes of vector mesons is of utmost importance for analyzing di - electron spectra from intermediate heavy - ion reactions and hadron - nucleus reactions as well .",
    "corresponding experiments with the hades detector @xcite started recently .",
    "this is the main motivation for the present note .    to illustrate some aspects of light vector meson production in hadronic reactions let us mention three issues related to this topic .",
    "\\(i ) while for the processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( here @xmath0 ; @xmath14 stands either for the proton ( @xmath15 ) or for the neutron ( @xmath16 ) ) some experimental data is at our disposal , one needs often a model to deduce the corresponding reactions at the neutron .",
    "there are various examples for the ratio of the cross sections @xmath17 which highlight a strong energy dependence and clearly show that there is no simple isospin factor relating these two channels .",
    "\\(ii ) there is a long list of various effects influenced by the hidden strangeness content in the nucleon . among them",
    "is the dropping mass of the @xmath18 meson in nuclear matter , as predicted by the qcd sum rule approach @xcite . as shown in @xcite , such an in - medium mass shift of the @xmath18 meson",
    "can considerably modify the di - electron spectrum in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this modification depends on the poorly known fraction of hidden strangeness in the nucleon .",
    "present lattice qcd calculations do not deliver a stringent constrain of this fraction @xcite .",
    "otherwise , as the nucleon is the core of visible matter in the universe , it is challenging to understand its composition , and therefore any possible source of information is well come .",
    "our approach to this problem is to consider the sensitivity of @xmath18 meson production on a possible @xmath19 component in the nucleon wave function .",
    "\\(iii ) below we are going to include , within an effective lagrangian model on tree level , resonances in the above mentioned hadronic reactions and elaborate their specific importance for several observables . otherwise , we also demonstrate that certain reactions can be effectively parameterized without inclusion of resonances .",
    "the present note is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recapitulate the isoscalar - isovector ( @xmath20 ) interference near the @xmath21 threshold and emphasize that this effect can allow a unique access to resonance properties .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a brief description of the combined @xmath21 and @xmath18 production in @xmath22 reactions with respect to the ozi rule and its implications for the hidden strangeness content of the nucleon . in section 4",
    "we consider @xmath21 and @xmath18 production in @xmath23 reactions .",
    "our conclusions can be found in section 5 .",
    "[ fig_1 ] -3 mm -3 mm    fig .  1 : tree level diagrams for the reaction @xmath1 .    the tree level diagrams depicted in fig .  1",
    "serve as basis for an exploratory study of the reaction @xmath25 with interfering intermediate @xmath26 and @xmath21 mesons .",
    "this reaction , proposed in @xcite as a suitable probe of baryon resonance dynamics , is evaluated in @xcite with resonances @xmath27 and @xmath28 up to 1720 mev without the t - channel process displayed in the right part of fig .  1 ;",
    "effective couplings are taken from @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) . some illustrative results of this model exhibited in fig .",
    "2 agree in trends with the more sophisticated approach of @xcite : a destructive ( constructive ) @xmath20 interference in the reaction @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) below the @xmath21 threshold .",
    "angular distributions and the energy ( @xmath31 ) dependence of the invariant mass spectra can reveal the role of individual resonances .",
    "a comparison of both isospin channels can be used to disentangle the @xmath32 subthreshold resonances .",
    "both reactions can be explored experimentally at gsi with the pion beams and hades in exclusive measurements .",
    "[ fig_2 ] +   +",
    "a combined analysis of the @xmath21 and @xmath18 production in the reaction @xmath1 shows that the experimental data can be well described by including s- , u- and t - channels . the contribution of the meson current dominates @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no need to introduce an anomalously large coupling @xmath33 which could be interpreted , in the spirit of @xcite , as a hint to a substantial hidden strangeness fraction in the nucleon .",
    "the standard ozi rule violation comes in this description from the @xmath34 vertex , see @xcite for a discussion of this issue .",
    "further investigations of photo - production of @xmath21 and @xmath18 mesons at the nucleon @xcite do also not allow to deduce hints to a sizeable admixture of hidden strangeness in the nucleon wave function .",
    "the tree level diagrams exhibited in fig .  1 serve as building blocks of diagrams for the corresponding processes @xmath2 in fig .",
    "therefore , one could expect that with adjusting the parameters of effective lagrangians to the reactions @xmath1 a substantial part of the ambiguities of in the parameter space is removed . however , additionally exchanged mesons and form factors ruin this expectation .",
    "rather , a combined analysis of both reactions can reduce ambiguities , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig_3 ] +    fig .  3 : tree level diagrams for the reaction @xmath2 .      fig .",
    "4 exhibits a calculation @xcite of the reaction @xmath37 within the described framework . to show the ambiguities inherent in the tree level effective lagrangian approach",
    "two different parameter sets are used .",
    "one parameter set delivers a dominating meson current for the sub - reaction @xmath38 ( fig .  4 bottom left ) , while the other employs a dominating nucleon current ( fig .  4 bottom right )",
    "correspondingly the interferences in the reaction @xmath37 are quite different ( see fig .",
    "4 top ) .",
    "[ fig_4 ] +   +    the model for the reaction @xmath37 is used to deduce a parameterization of the cross section cross section @xmath39 which serves as input of a calculation @xcite of the reaction @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a tagged spectator proton .",
    "a corresponding measurement is feasible at cosy - anke @xcite .",
    "the previous framework can be extended to study the production of @xmath21 mesons . a preliminary parameter adjustment to the angular distribution at an excess energy of 170 mev ( fig .",
    "5 bottom right ) describes the energy dependence of the total cross section in fairly large range ( fig .",
    "5 top left ) .",
    "( a similar approach is used in @xcite .",
    "note that present model does not yet include nucleon resonances . )",
    "the isospin rotated reaction @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "5 top right ) which results in a strongly energy dependent ratio of cross sections ( fig .",
    "5 bottom left ) is presently used to study the reaction @xmath43 for which already first results from cosy - anke are at our disposal @xcite .",
    "[ fig_5 ] +",
    "in summary we present a few selected examples of calculations of near - threshold vector meson production in @xmath22 and @xmath23 reactions . in doing",
    "so we employ tree level effective lagrangians to accomplish simple parameterizations of the elementary cross sections . the role of baryon resonances in the reaction @xmath44",
    "is highlighted within a s - u - channel model with coupling strengths deduced from a chiral quark model",
    ". a combined study of of @xmath21 and @xmath18 meson production is mentioned not to reveal the need of a noticeable @xmath19 shake - off the nucleon .",
    "the role of baryon resonances for the reaction @xmath45 is presently under consideration .",
