    "quantum entanglement is a very important physical resource in quantum computing@xcite .",
    "a separated pair of entangled quantum system can be used to transfer quantum information .",
    "the measurement on one system of an entangled pair determines the outcome of the measurement on the other system instantaneously .",
    "entanglement has a non - local nature in its essence . the special theory of relativity",
    ", however , tells us that there is no agreement on simultaneity for distant events among observers in inertial reference frames moving relative to each other .",
    "there are no causal relations between two spatially separate events . in this aspect relativity",
    "is local in its nature .",
    "hence it is an intriguing question how the entanglement of a pair changes among observers in relative motions .",
    "the spin state of elementary spin @xmath0 particles , such as electrons , are good candidates for qubits .",
    "massive spin @xmath0 particles , however , have momentum degrees of freedom other than the spin degrees of freedom . moreover it has been shown the relativistic transformation entangles the spin and momentum degrees of freedom and the spin entropy determined by the reduced density matrix for the spin is not covariant under lorentz transformation @xcite .",
    "then the spin entanglements would also depend on the motion of observers and it is interesting how the spin entanglements between massive spin @xmath0 particles would be changed under relativistic transformations .",
    "several authors have investigated the effect of the entanglement under relativistic transformations @xcite .",
    "gingrich and adamai @xcite concluded that the spin entanglement of a pair of particles is not invariant under relativistic motion , although the whole entanglement of spin and momentum degrees of freedom is lorentz invariant .",
    "they have founded that the special pairs of spin which are initially separable can be maximally entangled in the special reference frame .",
    "they also noted that this property could lead to simplified state preparation and purification protocols .",
    "later czachor _ et .",
    "_ have pointed out the definition of reduced density matrix with traced - out momenta in ref .",
    "@xcite is not justified .",
    "the results of later works have not reached the same conclusion depending on whether only the change of states are considered @xcite or what kinds of relativistic spin observables are used @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the discrepancy is the lack of clear understanding for the proper spin operator for massive dirac particles .    in this letter",
    ", we will clarify the problems associated with the relativistic effects on quantum spin entanglement .",
    "the discrepancy in the previous works will be cured by considering a dirac equation and spin observables consistently .",
    "dirac equation is a successful theory to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity .",
    "therefore we will use the dirac theory for a massive spin 1/2 particle , so - called a massive dirac particle , to obtain a consistent covariant approach for the relativistic effect on the spin entanglement of a pair of dirac particles .",
    "we use ` mean spin angular momentum ' operators , defined by foldy and woutheysen@xcite , to describe a good quantum spin observables we will call these operators as mean spin operators .",
    "the mean spin operators commute with dirac hamiltonian unlike the spin operator in the conventional representation and since the time evolution of the state of dirac particle is generated by dirac hamiltonian , the mean spin operators are constants of motion and become good quantum observables .",
    "the spin operator in the proper non - relativistic pauli theory is this mean spin operator which describes the measured spin of the particle .",
    "a free massive spin @xmath0 particle , _ i.e. _ a massive dirac particle , is described by the time - dependent dirac equation @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath4 dirac matrices in standard dirac representation , @xmath5 is a momentum operator and a natural unit defined by @xmath6 is used .",
    "here we are interested in the change of entanglement by relativistic motion of observers so that it is enough to consider the free dirac particles without additional interactions .",
    "the eigenvalue equation of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath7 is as follows @xmath8 where @xmath9 and the superscript @xmath10 represents positive - energy and negative - energy solutions .",
    "the state @xmath11 can also be understood as the lorentz transformed state from the state @xmath12 in the rest frame of the particle such as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is a standard lorentz transformation depending on @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a 4-spinor representation for @xmath18 .",
    "we use the following normalization @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a scalar product in hilbert space and the scalar products between other states are zero .",
    "note that @xmath21 is a lorentz invariant delta function .    here",
    "the label @xmath22 represents other degrees of freedom than momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "it must be related to the spin of the particle , however at this stage , the meaning of this label is not clear since the conventional @xmath23 spin operators @xmath24 does not commute with the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "the proper spin operator must commute with the hamiltonian which governs the dynamics of the particle and also satisfy the su(2 ) algebra .",
    "the operator @xmath25 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath26 of the rest frame of the particle and satisfies su(2 ) algebra , hence the proper spin operator must be reduced to @xmath25 in the rest frame of the particle .",
    "foldy and woutheysen(fw ) has defined the mean spin operator by the use of the `` canonical '' transformation such as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unitary operator as @xmath29 the mean spin operators satisfy su(2 ) algebra and commute with the dirac hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath30 = 0 .",
    "$ ] therefore it is possible to find simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath7 and @xmath31 , such as @xmath32 it is now clear that the variable @xmath22 in @xmath33 represents the @xmath34 component of the mean spin operator @xmath35 .",
    "the expectation value of the mean spin operator describes the average spin of the particle which is really measured .",
    "this mean spin operator is the same as the spin operator in the non - relativistic pauli hamiltonian when it is represented in the representation ( so - called foldy - woutheysen representation ) where the dirac hamiltonian has the diagonal form .",
    "note that for positive - energy states the conventional dirac spinor @xmath36 is the same as the foldy - woutheysen spinor @xmath37 .",
    "this implies the mean spin for a particle with positive energy in its rest frame does not change under the lorentz transformation @xmath18 .",
    "the general situation appears when the observer to see a particle with momentum @xmath16 moves relativistically such that the momentum of the particle becomes @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an arbitrary orthochronous lorentz transformation .",
    "the spinor state @xmath40 described by the observer in old reference frame will be transformed as @xmath41 to the observer in the new reference frame , where @xmath42 is the spinor representation for @xmath39 .",
    "it is nontrivial to represent @xmath41 with eigenstates @xmath43 in the new reference frame since the two successive lorentz transformations @xmath42 and @xmath17 does not become one lorentz transformation in general . here",
    "@xmath44 is a spatial component for the transformed 4-momentum .",
    "a fw - representation will be used to represent the transformed state explicitly . in the fw - representation ,",
    "the transformed dirac hamiltonian and the mean spin operator take simple forms @xmath45 note that both operators are block diagonal .",
    "this fact makes that the eigenstates in fw - representation can be written as the product form @xmath46 now the eigenstate in the original representation can be obtained as @xmath47 .",
    "it is convenient to use the new notations for the spin state @xmath48 in fw - representation such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 which represents the transformation of a fw - spinor state under an arbitrary lorentz transformation @xmath39 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 this relation is described in the fw - representation as follows @xmath54 therefore the transformation matrix is obtained as @xmath55    to find an explicit form of @xmath56 , we consider simple lorentz boost @xmath57 in @xmath58 direction with rapidity @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear that a rotation of the space does not have any effect on the entanglement .",
    "therefore we consider only a lorentz boost without loss of generality .",
    "writing the space part of momentum vector in spherical coordinate @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a polar angle from the positive @xmath58-axis and @xmath62 is the azimuthal angle in the @xmath63 plane from the @xmath64-axis .",
    "we get @xmath65 where @xmath66 , \\\\ b&= & \\frac{p \\sin ( \\theta ) } { \\sqrt{(m+e ) \\left(m+e'\\right ) } } \\sinh \\left(\\frac{\\xi } { 2}\\right ) , \\\\",

    "the sign of energy is invariant under lorentz transformation so that we do not have to consider negative energy state for a particle with positive mass @xmath67 . here",
    "we will study the entanglement of particles with positive energies and all considerations can be given in the two - dimensional positive energy subspace .",
    "therefore the concurrence is a good measure of the spin entanglement for two massive positive energy dirac particles . in the positive energy subspace",
    "the transformation matrix becomes @xmath68 matrix @xmath69    a general positive energy state in consideration can be written as @xmath70 where the normalization condition is satisfied as @xmath71 the density matrix @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 .",
    "then the @xmath74-component of the reduced spin density matrix @xmath75 is obtained by @xmath76 note that this reduced density matrix is @xmath68 matrix as expected for the positive energy state .",
    "the spin entanglement of this reduced state is obtained from the concurrence of wootters formula @xmath77 @xcite , where @xmath78 s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath79 with @xmath80    it is interesting to study the effect of lorentz boost on the state whose reduced spin state is a bell state initially , @xmath81 where + @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 are in the @xmath85-plane with the same magnitude @xmath86 and spin variables represents the eigenvalues of mean spin operators .",
    "the angle between @xmath83 and @xmath84 is @xmath62 . by writing the state as a density matrix and tracing over the momentum variable",
    ", we get a maximally entangled spin state ( @xmath87 ) . for an observer moving to the positive @xmath58 axis with rapidity @xmath59 , the state changes according to the transformation matrix ( [ tm2 ] ) and , therefore",
    ", the concurrence would change also .    taking limit @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ", the concurrence yields the simple form @xmath90 in this limit the final reduced spin state has all possible concurrence depending on the angle @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath83 and @xmath84 are perpendicular , the spin entanglement vanishes entirely .    for completeness",
    "we consider the bell inequality @xcite as a parallel approach .",
    "the bell inequality violation is given only for states with non - zero concurrence , since the entanglement is needed to violate the bell inequality .",
    "moreover for two qubit systems the amount of violation of bell inequality can be an entanglement measure to some extent @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect the consistent violation of bell inequality is obtained with the concurrence .",
    "the previous results @xcite , however , shows the maximal violation of bell inequality is obtained in case the proper direction of spin measurement is chosen .",
    "we will show the consistent results are obtained independent on the direction of spin measurements different from the previous results .",
    "the main reason for this is that we consider both the transformation of the state and a spin operator correctly .",
    "the generalized bell inequality is determined by the following bell parameter , @xmath91 where the spin correlation function is given by @xmath92 where @xmath35 is the mean spin operator and @xmath93(@xmath94 ) is the direction for spin measurement . for a given state the maximum value of bell parameter , @xmath95 ,",
    "is obtained by adjusting the directions @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for spin measurement .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows @xmath100 versus the concurrence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : conc ] ) for the reduced spin state in the limit of @xmath101 .",
    "this shows one - to - one correspondence between two quantities , specifically , a monotonic behavior .",
    "the maximum value of bell parameter becomes less than 2 even though the entanglement remains ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this is because the more entanglement is required to give the same bell parameter for mixed states @xcite .",
    "the reduced spin state for @xmath103 in the limit of @xmath104 is the mixed state , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are bell states .",
    "the concurrence and the maximum value of bell parameter for this state are both zero .",
    "we have studied the relativistic effects on the spin entanglement of two massive dirac particles using the simultaneous eigenstate of the dirac hamiltonian and the mean spin operator . in this formalism",
    "the meaning of spin operators as quantum observables is clear .",
    "the mean spin operators commute with the dirac hamiltonian and become the conventional spin operators of the pauli hamiltonian in non - relativistic limit @xcite .",
    "this means the mean spin operator is the good quantum variable involved in spin measurement .",
    "we have found the transformation matrix which represents the transformation of a spinor state with given momentum to spinor states with the transformed momentum under an arbitrary lorentz transformation .",
    "we have shown the consistent monotonic relation between the concurrence and bell inequality of the final reduced spin states transformed from the special initial states .",
    "we expect this consistent behavior is achieved for other states considering our mean spin correlations .",
    "we have clarified the meaning of trace over momentum for a 4-spinor state , so our approach makes it possible to study the relation between the entanglement of momentum and spin of two dirac particles under the arbitrary lorentz transformation in clear manner .",
