    "4 ) . comparing these figures .",

    "6 ) , plotted for the same surface magnetic field value , it is seen that the layering transitions are found by the ( mc ) method , when increasing the temperature , before these same transitions can be seen by the ( mf ) method .",
    "but the global transitions are found by the two methods , and qualitatively the phase diagrams obtained exhibit similar topologies .",
    "it is worth to note that for very low temperature , ( mf ) and the ( mc ) are in good agreement with the ground state phase diagram .",

    "when increasing the external field @xmath83 the corners transits ( figs . 7a and 7b ) before the other intra - layering transitions . such behavior was not obtained in the perfect surface case model .",
    "however , the other layer - by - layer transitions occur when increasing the external field at specific temperature values .",
    "as one can expects , the external field values needed to make arising the intra - layering and inter - layering transitions increase with increasing the order of the layer counted from the surface @xmath18 .",

    "4 , it is seen that the increasing system size effect is to decrease the intra and inter layering temperature values .",
    "the bulk layering transitions are shifted to higher external magnetic field values , for a fixed surface magnetic field value .",
    "+ to complete this study , we have investigated in fig .",
    "9 the surface , @xmath2 , and bulk @xmath4 intra - layering temperature profiles as a function of the system size @xmath10 for two surface magnetic field values @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "9a ) ( as well as @xmath4 , fig .",
    "9b ) decreases when increasing the system size .",
    "for a fixed system size @xmath10 , these intra - layering temperatures decrease when increasing the surface magnetic field values .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 reaches the wetting temperature for sufficiently large values of the system size .",
    "+ to conclude this study , we note that the presence of an edge ( angle @xmath87 ) decreases the wetting temperature compared with the perfect case ( angle @xmath88 ) , see ref .",
    "this finding is in a good agreement the results obtained by rejmer _",
    "the intra and inter - layering transitions of a three - dimensional spins ising model with edge surfaces are studied within the mean field theory and monte carlo simulations . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the only layering transitions , occurring under the effect of an external and a surface magnetic fields , are : surface transition , bulk transition and surface to bulk transition . when increasing the temperature , a succession of intra - layering transitions , absent in the case of perfect surfaces [ 13,15 ] and the continuous model [ 7,16 ] , are found .",
    "the layering temperatures obtained by the mean field theory are higher than those predicted by mc method .",
    "the two methods lead to similar results for very low temperatures .",
