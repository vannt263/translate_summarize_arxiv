    "ic443 ( @xmath3g189.1@xmath43.0 ) is a relatively bright snr in the galactic anti - centre , where the galactic background emission is relatively faint .",
    "it is @xmath5  arcmin in diameter , with brighter emission to the northeast , and fainter emission ( with a somewhat larger out radius ) in the southwest .",
    "structure is seen at radio wavelengths down to scales of arcsec ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "various observations show that ic443 is interacting with a surrounding molecular cloud ( e.g.@xcite ) , and radio spectral index studies reveal a region of flatter spectrum emission in the east ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we have combined observations made of ic443 at 151  mhz from two telescopes ( see table  [ t : telescopes ] ) , in order to cover a wide range of angular scales . the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) ",
    "see @xcite  is a synthesis telescope that provides baselines up to @xmath6  km , but lacks good @xmath7-plane coverage on baselines less than a few hundred metres .",
    "the gmrt observations of ic443 miss about 20% of the total expect flux density of the snr ( @xmath8  jy at 151 mhz , @xcite ) , due to the missing short baselines .",
    "the cambridge low - frequency synthesis telescope ( clfst ) ",
    "see @xcite  was an ( approximately ) e  w synthesis telescope that provides good coverage of the @xmath7-plane for the small baselines missed by the gmrt .",
    "the smoothed 151-mhz image of ic443 , from observations made in 1983/84 , as used in @xcite , with a resolution of @xmath9  arcmin@xmath10 ( ns@xmath11ew ) covers baselines up to @xmath12  km at all position angles .",
    "figure  [ f : combined ] shows the combined gmrt plus clfst image of ic443 at 151  mhz .",
    "this includes emission on a wide range of scales from @xmath2  arcsec to 45  arcmin .",
    "this was made using the imerg task in aips which takes the larger / smaller scale structure from the clfst / gmrt images respectively , gradually merging the contributions on the intermediate scales in both images ."
