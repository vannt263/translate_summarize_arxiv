    "neutrinoless double - beta decay ( @xmath2 ) is nowadays a topical issue that has attracted a lot of interest from both theoretical and experimental sides @xcite .",
    "this decay mode is still unobserved and would violate lepton number conservation .",
    "its existence would demonstrate that the neutrino is a massive majorana particle and would provide a measurement of the absolute mass scale of the neutrino . obviously , the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) involved in such a process must be determined accurately to extract a reliable estimate of the neutrino mass . on the other hand , the two - neutrino double - beta decay mode ( @xmath3 ) is perfectly allowed by the standard model .",
    "it is a rare second - order weak - interaction process that has been observed experimentally in several nuclei ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus , to test the reliability of the nuclear structure calculations involved in the @xmath2 process , one checks first the ability of the nuclear models to reproduce the experimental information available .",
    "certainly , there are differences between the nmes involved in both processes , but there are also clear similarities . among the differences , one should notice that the @xmath3-decay nmes are dominated by gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions connecting the initial and final @xmath4 states with all @xmath5 states in the intermediate nucleus . on the other hand , in the @xmath2 process the intermediate states run over all @xmath6 values .",
    "another difference with consequences in the evaluation of the nmes is that in @xmath2 decay the average virtual neutrino momentum is much larger than the typical scale of nuclear excitations and then closure approximation can be safely used . in the case of @xmath3 decay",
    "the neutrino momenta are comparable with the nuclear excitation energies , preventing the use of closure . among the similarities ,",
    "the two processes connect the same initial and final nuclear ground states to be described within a given nuclear model and they share the calculation for the intermediate @xmath5 states .",
    "therefore , reproducing the @xmath3 nmes is a requirement for any nuclear structure model aiming to describe the neutrinoless mode .",
    "one can go even further and compare the calculations , not only with the @xmath3 nmes extracted from the measured half - lives , which is nothing but a number , but also with the gt@xmath7 ( gt@xmath8 ) strength distribution of the single branch connecting the initial ( final ) ground state with all the @xmath5 states in the intermediate nucleus .",
    "this comparison provides a more detailed information on which the calculation can be tested .",
    "gt strength distributions have been measured in recent years from high resolution charge - exchange reactions ( cer ) , within a large experimental program aimed to explore the gt properties at low excitation energies of double @xmath9-decay partners @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility to describe the rich information available at present on the gt nuclear response within a formalism based on a deformed proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) .",
    "this information includes global properties such as the location and strength of the gt resonance , more detailed description in the low - lying excitations , and last but not least , the @xmath3-decay nmes .",
    "this study was started for the double @xmath9-decay partners with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "here , we shall focus on the @xmath0cd  @xmath11sn and @xmath1nd  @xmath12sm decays , motivated by the recent experiments on cer performed for @xmath0cd@xmath13 in and @xmath0sn@xmath14 in @xcite , as well as for @xmath1nd@xmath15he,@xmath16pm and @xmath1sm@xmath17he)@xmath1pm @xcite . it is also worth mentioning the recent measurement of the electron capture in @xmath0 in @xcite that can be used as a benchmark for nuclear structure calculations . in addition , the double @xmath9 decay of @xmath1nd has received increasing attention in the last years and it is currently considered as one of the best candidates to search for the @xmath2 decay in the planned experiments sno+ , supernemo , and dcba .",
    "the reason for the interest in @xmath1nd is that it has a large phase - space factor and therefore a relatively short half - life .",
    "it also has a large @xmath18 energy that will reduce the background contamination .",
    "however , both @xmath1nd and @xmath1sm are deformed nuclei that require a deformed formalism to deal with them properly .",

    "the strength distribution is dominated by the gt component up to about 20 mev , although non - negligible contributions from ivsm components are found between 10 and 20 mev , overlapping with the gt strength of the gt giant resonance . above this energy",
    ", there is no significant amount of gt strength in the calculations .",
    "the interference effects are constructive below 20 mev and destructive above this energy , but they are not very important . in the @xmath20 direction",
    "the gt strength is expected to be strongly pauli blocked in nuclei with more neutrons than protons and therefore , the measured strength is mostly due to the ivsm resonance over the whole excitation - energy range .",
    "nevertheless , the strength found in low - lying isolated peaks is associated with gt transitions because the continuous tail of the ivsm resonance is very small at these energies and is not expected to exhibit any peak . in summary , the measured strength in the ( @xmath92 ) direction can be safely assigned to be gt in the low energy range below 10 mev and with some caution between 10 and 20 mev . beyond 20 mev",
    "the strength would be practically due to ivsm .",
    "on the other hand the measured strength in the ( @xmath93 ) direction would be due to ivsm transitions , except in the low - lying excitation energy below several mev , where the isolated peaks observed can be attributed to gt strength .",

    "@xcite . in general terms , we reproduce fairly well the global properties of the gt strength distributions , including the location of the gt resonance and the total strength measured , although the experimental gt resonances appear more fragmented than the calculated ones .",
    "similar comments to the previous case @xmath67 relative to the contributions from gt and ivsm components apply now to the case @xmath71 .",

    "this feature was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and was related to the strength of the @xmath33 residual interaction .",
    "the small contribution to the @xmath3 nmes from the region of the gt resonance is due to the joint effects of large energy denominators in eq .",

    "the sensitivity of the nmes to the skyrme interaction is manifest in the figures , but it is not as significant as the sensitivity found to other aspects such as the residual interactions , the deformation , or even the energy denominators .    another issue worth to comment is the treatment of the quenching factor of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath95 . the physical reasons for this quenching have been studied elsewhere @xcite and are related to the role of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , absent in the usual theoretical models , and to the limitations of model space , many - nucleon configurations , and deep correlations missing in these calculations .",
    "the implications of this quenching on the description of single-@xmath9 and double-@xmath9 decay observables have been considered recently in several works @xcite . in those works both",
    "the effective value of @xmath95 and the coupling strength of the residual interaction in the particle - particle channel are considered free parameters of the calculation .",
    "the striking result found is that very strong quenching values are needed to reproduce simultaneously the observations corresponding to the @xmath3 half - lives and to the single-@xmath9 decay branches , namely @xmath101 values for the ground state to ground state decay of the intermediate nucleus into the initial one , and the @xmath102 values for the ground state to ground state decay of the intermediate nucleus into the final one .",
    "different procedures for adjusting those parameters have been explained in refs .",
    "@xcite . the most recent analysis performed in ref . @xcite within a qrpa formalism comes to the conclusion that considerable quenching is needed , with an average value @xmath103 .",
    "the need of a strong quenching is also required in other theoretical approaches , such as different qrpa calculations ( @xmath104 ) @xcite , ibm-2 models @xcite , where the quenching obtained is @xmath105 for @xmath0cd and @xmath106 for @xmath1nd , or shell - model calculations that found quenching factors in the interval @xmath107",
    "@xcite for double-@xmath9 emitters from @xmath108ca up to @xmath1nd .",
    "one should note that the qrpa calculations leading to the strong quenching that fits the @xmath3 nmes have been performed within a spherical formalism neglecting possible effects from deformation degrees of freedom . because the main effect of deformation is a reduction of the nmes , deformed qrpa calculations shall demand less quenching to fit the experiment .",
    "although the goal of this paper is not to extract consequences on the quenching needed to fit the experiment , it will be very interesting to explore in the future the implications of deformation",
    ". this study will be part of a more ambitious project aiming to extract an effective @xmath95 value that fits the decay observables taking into account the uncertainties related to the theoretical description and including all possible @xmath3-decay candidates .",
    "in summary , using a theoretical approach based on a deformed hf+bcs+qrpa calculations with effective skyrme interactions , pairing correlations , and spin - isospin residual separable forces in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels , we have studied simultaneously the gt strength distributions of the double-@xmath9 decay partners ( @xmath0cd , @xmath0sn ) and ( @xmath1nd , @xmath1sm ) , reaching the intermediate nuclei @xmath0 in and @xmath1pm , respectively , as well as their @xmath3 nmes .",
    "our results for the energy distributions of the gt strength have been compared to recent data from charge - exchange reactions , whereas the calculated @xmath3 nmes have been compared with the experimental values extracted from the measured half - lives for these processes .",
    "we have discussed the sensitivity of our results to the various ingredients in the theoretical formalism .",
    "namely , to the skyrme force , to the residual interactions , to deformation , to effective @xmath95 values , and to the treatment of the energy denominators of the nmes .",
    "we found different sensitivities to them that have been analyzed and discussed .",
    "all in all , the method used in this work has demonstrated to be well suited to account for the rich variety of experimental information available on the nuclear gt response .",
    "the global properties of the energy distributions of the gt strength and the @xmath3 nmes are reasonably well reproduced , the exception is the detailed description of the low - lying gt strength distributions that could clearly be improved",
    ". it will be interesting in the future to extend these calculations by including all the double-@xmath9 decay candidates and to explore systematically the potential of this method .",
