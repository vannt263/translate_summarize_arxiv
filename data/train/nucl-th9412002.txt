    "algebraic models have been developed to describe systems in several fields of physics .",
    "examples in nuclear physics include the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite and its many extensions , the vibron model @xcite , and the @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite fermion dynamical symmetry models .",
    "there exist similar models in chemical physics @xcite and hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "such models are typically constructed by restricting the dynamics to a few important degrees of freedom .",
    "there is often an invariant group @xmath2 such that any hamiltonian we construct commutes with the group casimir operators . for the ibm",
    "this group is @xmath3 .",
    "one also often imposes the condition that any hamiltonian be invariant with respect to a lower dimensional group @xmath4 which is a subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "often @xmath4 is @xmath5 , implying spherical symmetry . for a given representation of @xmath2 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is block diagonal , with each block corresponding to a different representation of @xmath4 . in this paper , we show that it is possible for one block to have a particularly simple structure .",
    "we limit the discussion to the ibm .",
    "we first find the classical limit of the original quantum problem .",
    "this is a dynamical system with six degrees of freedom . imposing zero angular momentum suppresses three of these degrees of freedom @xcite , leaving three .",
    "the group structure of this reduced classical system is then studied leading to the identification of what we call an effective group structure .",
    "in particular , there is an effective group @xmath6 which is analogous to @xmath7 of the original system .",
    "we then quantise this reduced classical model to obtain a new quantum model .",
    "that this new model is different from the original is not contradictory since more than one quantum problem can share the same classical limit .",
    "nevertheless , the solution of this new model is similar to that of the original in the @xmath8 representation .",
    "the idea that @xmath8 states correspond to a smaller dimension in the classical mechanics was noticed in a very different context in reference ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result is of some interest in the study of chaos in collective nuclei @xcite .",
    "the three dimensional system is further reduced by boson number conservation so that there are only two independent degrees of freedom .",
    "two dimensional systems are particularly amenable to the usual analyses of chaos since the classical motion can be depicted on poincar sections and periodic orbits are easier to find .",
    "we can also study the quantum mechanical wavefunctions and husimi @xcite distributions in detail .",
    "it is then possible to study wavefunctions and look for localisation on unstable periodic orbits @xcite among other effects .    in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the ibm including its classical limit .",
    "the group chains of the effective @xmath9 model are discussed in section 3 in the context of the classical dynamics . in section 4",
    "we discuss the allowed representations of the effective group chains .",
    "we impose a constraint that our model only admit states which belong to the symmetric representation of the permutation group @xmath10 .",
    "it is then shown that the representations have the same structure as in the original @xmath3 model . in section 5",
    "we discuss a specific classical hamiltonian and show how it can be integrated at the three dynamical symmetries of the effective model . in section 6 we describe a quantum hamiltonian with the required @xmath9 symmetry and which corresponds to the original @xmath3 hamiltonian .",
    "we find its eigenenergies at the dynamical symmetry limits and show that they are equal to the energies of the original model to leading order in the particle number .",
    "therefore this can be thought of as a semiclassical approximation .",
    "the philosophy of this approach is similar to that of reference @xcite .",
    "in this section we review those features of the ibm which are of special interest in this paper . see reference [ 1 ] for a complete review .",
    "the ibm is a model for the structure of even - even collective nuclei which assumes that the monopole and quadrupole degrees of freedom are the most important .",
    "it also assumes that all excitations are bosonic because of the existence of pairing interactions which are dominant at low energies .",
    "therefore , we introduce one monopole boson operator @xmath11 and five quadrupole boson operators @xmath12 where @xmath13 .    the 36 bilinear operators @xmath14",
    "are the generators of a @xmath3 algebra .",
    "this means that any hamiltonian constructed from the generators will commute with the @xmath3 casimir operators .",
    "since the system is bosonic , we only consider symmetric representations so there is only one independent casimir operator , @xmath15 the eigenvalue of this operator , @xmath16 , is the number of bosonic pairs or half the number of valence nucleons .",
    "any eigenstate of such a hamiltonian belongs to a specific @xmath3 representation which is labelled by @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath3 symmetry , we demand spherical symmetry by requiring that there be @xmath5 invariance .",
    "there are three group chains which connect these two groups @xmath17 if we construct a hamiltonian solely out of the casimir invariants of one chain , then it is solvable and we say that it has a dynamical symmetry .",
    "the classical limit of the quantum model is obtained @xcite through the use of coherent states @xcite .",
    "these are defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vacuum state which contains no bosons .",
    "each coherent state is parametrised by six continuous complex variables @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . under time",
    "evolution a coherent state @xmath22 will evolve to a new state which is approximately another coherent state @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to study the time dependence of the variables @xmath20 .",
    "a time - dependent variational approximation valid for large boson number @xcite shows that these variables evolve according to hamilton s equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the classical hamiltonian and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are canonical position and momentum coordinates . in what follows",
    "we will denote quantum operators with carats and their classical counterparts with script font .",
    "the classical limit of any quantum operator , including the hamiltonian , is obtained by making the substitutions @xcite @xmath28 for example , the classical limit of the number operator ( [ eq : qnum ] ) is @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that it is conserved means that the phase space is compact .",
    "this prescription of finding the classical limit is not unique .",
    "for example , the coherent states defined in equation ( [ eq : cohstate ] ) do not belong to a specific @xmath3 or @xmath5 representation .",
    "we might like them to have this property so that in the classical dynamics we are studying a reduced dimensional phase space on which the classical boson number and angular momentum are fixed .",
    "this has been done for the @xmath3 algebra @xcite in which use of projected coherent states means that there is one fewer degree of freedom in the classical dynamics .",
    "it has not been done for the @xmath5 algebra ; presumably the resulting phase space would be very topologically complicated . in this work",
    "we will show that we can define a simple phase space for the special case of zero angular momentum .",
    "another method of finding the classical limit is to identify the quantum commutators with the classical poisson brackets @xcite .",
    "one then identifies each of the generators as a phase space coordinate and uses the casimir invariants to eliminate variables ; this has been done explicitly for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 algebras @xcite .",
    "this is an elegant approach but is difficult in this application because the bosonic nature of the ibm only allows symmetric representations of @xmath3 and it is not clear how to invoke this constraint using this method .    in reference",
    "@xcite the authors discuss how the variables @xmath26 can be related to the intrinsic variables of the bohr - mottelson model @xcite .",
    "these are the deformation parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the euler angles @xmath34 and the corresponding momenta @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the result is    [ eq : alpha ] @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41    here @xmath42 are the wigner matrices which are a function of the three euler angles @xmath34 and @xmath43 is a global phase of no importance .",
    "this choice of variables explicitly conserves @xmath44 .",
    "there is a simplification when the magnitude of the angular momentum is zero @xcite .",
    "in that case we have that the @xmath45 are zero and we can choose a frame in which @xmath46 . equation ( 6 ) then implies @xmath47 then the motion is described by only two degrees of freedom , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for example , @xmath48 is a quantum hamiltonian belonging to the @xmath49 dynamical symmetry .",
    "( @xmath50 is the @xmath49 casimir operator and equals @xmath51 . )",
    "its classical limit for zero angular momentum is @xmath52 which is a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions .",
    "we have ignored terms which arise from normal ordering since they vanish in the classical limit .",
    "therefore , the original @xmath49 symmetry is manifest as a @xmath53 symmetry in this situation .",
    "we show in the next section that all of the groups in the original model map to lower dimensional groups when we study the classical problem with zero angular momentum .",
    "this dimensional reduction can also be understood on the quantum level by counting the number of distinct eigenvalues which is necessary to specify a quantum state . for a fixed value of @xmath16",
    "we need five quantum numbers to do this .",
    "we always have angular momentum @xmath54 and one of its components @xmath55 as good eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , in general we need three additional quantum numbers so that the system is three dimensional @xcite",
    ". however , in the special case that @xmath8 , it follows that @xmath56 , the projection of @xmath54 onto the symmetry axis , is also zero .",
    "( @xmath56 is also a `` missing quantum number '' in the decomposition from @xmath31 to @xmath5 . ) therefore , once we specify @xmath8 , we only need to specify two additional quantum numbers to identify a state , which means that the system is essentially two dimensional .",
    "in this section , we discuss the various group chains which arise in classifying the classical behaviour for zero angular momentum .",
    "first , it is convenient to define new variables @xmath57 equation ( [ eq : alphas ] ) then guarantees that @xmath58 . after making this canonical transformation we are free to use the fact that @xmath59 so that @xmath60 . for",
    "now , we will explicitly keep @xmath61 and not use @xmath44 conservation to eliminate it .",
    "we then have a problem in three degrees of freedom given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 and can define nine bilinear objects @xmath64 their poisson brackets are @xmath65 , which is the classical version @xcite of the quantum commutator relation @xmath66= ( \\hat{g}_{il}\\delta_{jk } - \\hat{g}_{kj}\\delta_{il}).$ ] these are the commutator relations for the generators of the @xmath9 algebra and we conclude that classically we have a @xmath9 algebra .",
    "the casimir invariant @xmath67 , has zero poisson bracket with any hamiltonian we construct from the generators and is therefore always a constant of motion .",
    "this is just the particle number and is numerically equal to @xmath44 .",
    "we wish to consider the nature of the possible hamiltonians which can be constructed from these nine generators .",
    "these hamiltonians are integrable if they have three independent constants in involution @xcite .",
    "this is guaranteed if there is a dynamical symmetry @xcite , so we want to know the possible dynamical symmetries . to find these , it is helpful to refer to the original @xmath3 model .",
    "its first group chain is obtained by considering a @xmath49 subalgebra which consists of 25 generators . of these generators ,",
    "all but four are zero for zero angular momentum .",
    "the remaining ones are @xmath68 which have a @xmath53 algebra .",
    "we can consider an @xmath69 subalgebra whose generator is @xmath70 .",
    "the reason for this choice will be discussed below .",
    "therefore , we can identify one group chain as @xmath71 if we write down a hamiltonian in terms of the casimir invariants of these groups , then these invariants are constants of motion in involution and the motion is integrable .",
    "the second group chain of the @xmath3 model is @xmath31 which has eight generators @xcite .",
    "the first three are the three components of the angular momentum and the other five are components of the rank two quadrupole tensor , @xmath72 where the last term means that we couple the objects in the brackets to angular momentum two and @xmath73 . in the present case all of the angular momenta components are zero .",
    "in addition , @xmath74 and @xmath75 so we are left with two independent quantities @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath79 and @xmath80 have zero poisson bracket so they are the generators of a @xmath81 algebra .",
    "we can therefore identify the group chain as @xmath82    the third group chain is @xmath83 in the original model .",
    "it has 15 generators .",
    "there are three components of the angular momentum , which are zero .",
    "there are five components of a quadrupole tensor which is the same as in equation ( [ eq : qclass ] ) but without the last term .",
    "as in the @xmath31 case @xmath84 and @xmath75 , so only two components are independent",
    ". finally , there are seven components of a rank three octupole tensor @xmath85 .",
    "these are all zero except the @xmath86 components which are equal .",
    "therefore , we have three independent quantities @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these have an @xmath5 structure .",
    "we can consider @xmath91 to be the generator of an @xmath69 algebra , as in the @xmath53 chain .",
    "we then have the group chain @xmath92    in summary , the original @xmath3 group chain structure as shown in equation ( [ eq : chain ] ) has the following simpler structure when we consider the classical model for zero angular momentum : @xmath93    a few comments are in order . in the original @xmath3 model , there is a constraint that all group chains must contain the @xmath5 subalgebra for which the @xmath94 are rank two spherical tensors . for example",
    ", this constrains the @xmath49 subalgebra to be that one which contains all the @xmath95 generators and none of the generators which contain @xmath61 or @xmath96 .",
    "an analogous constraint on the allowed representations in this picture is that all states must be in a symmetric representation of the @xmath10 permutation group , as will be discussed .",
    "another important point is that for the classical mechanics , these group chains are exact .",
    "the poisson brackets of the relevant degrees of freedom have precisely the structure appropriate for the three chains derived above .",
    "there are slight problems upon requantisation , as will be discussed below .",
    "it is also useful to motivate the choice of @xmath69 generator for the @xmath53 and @xmath5 algebra chains .",
    "consider the original @xmath97 casimir invariant @xcite @xmath98 the second term is zero for zero angular momentum .",
    "also @xmath99 since no combination of @xmath62 or @xmath100 can combine to give an odd index .",
    "in addition @xmath101 due to the equality of @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this leaves @xmath104 therefore , @xmath105 where @xmath91 is precisely the @xmath69 generator in the first and third group chains .",
    "in fact , equations ( [ eq : alphas ] ) and ( [ eq : so3gen ] ) imply @xmath106 so that @xmath91 generates @xmath33 rotations .",
    "thus , @xmath69 symmetry is the same as @xmath33 independence and implies @xmath36 conservation . in the zero angular momentum limit",
    ", this result agrees with the well know connection between the @xmath97 casimir invariant and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasised that the @xmath5 and @xmath69 groups discussed here are not groups of spatial rotations but are groups describing abstract transformations among the bosons .",
    "in this section , we discuss the allowed representations of the three group chains .",
    "we start with the first group chain which is given by equation ( [ eq : u2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath9 is labelled by the quantum number @xmath16 ; this is the same as the @xmath3 eigenvalue since in each case @xmath16 refers to the number of bosons .",
    "the @xmath53 representation label is denoted by @xmath107 and can take all integer values from 0 to @xmath16 . for a given representation of @xmath53 , the allowed representations of @xmath69 are @xmath108",
    "this selection of every other representation is a general property of the group chain @xmath109 . for @xmath110 ,",
    "it is derived in reference @xcite in a discussion of two dimensional harmonic oscillators",
    ".    however , not all of these @xmath69 representations are physically realised .",
    "there is an additional constraint that all wavefunctions are in a symmetric representation of @xmath111 , the three point permutation group @xcite .",
    "this is most easily seen in the configuration space shown in fig .  1 for which @xmath32 and @xmath33 are polar coordinates .",
    "since @xmath9 is a compact group there is a constraint that @xmath112 .",
    "the heavy lines at @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 denote prolate symmetry and the dashed lines at @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote oblate symmetry .",
    "there are six physically indistinguishable regions connected by the six elements of the @xmath119 group .",
    "this means that all states must belong to the symmetric representation of this group .",
    "we can think of the configuration space as being given by just one of the six domains .",
    "this is not the case for general angular momentum , since the angular momentum axis picks out a direction which differentiates among the domains .",
    "more fundamentally , the fact that the system has the symmetry of the three point permutation group arises from the fact that for zero angular momentum no axis is special so any relabelling of the @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 axes leaves the system invariant .",
    "such relabellings correspond to spatial rotations and reflections .",
    "the fact that the zero angular momentum states belong to the symmetric representation of the @xmath10 group arises because they must be invariant with respect to all spatial rotations and reflections and therefore with respect to all relabellings .",
    "only the symmetric representation has this property so it follows that the zero angular momentum states belong to the symmetric representation of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the condition of having zero angular momentum specifies both the @xmath10 symmetry and the relevant representation .",
    "it is a simple result of group theory @xcite that the functions @xmath123 , with @xmath124 a non - negative integer , belong to the symmetric @xmath125 representation of @xmath119 .",
    "( the functions @xmath126 belong to the @xmath127 representation and all other possibilities belong to the two dimensional @xmath128 representation . )",
    "thus , we can label the allowed representations of @xmath69 by @xmath124 non - negative and divisible by three .",
    "this prescription yields precisely the same number of allowed states as the original @xmath3 problem . this is simple enough to show in general but is most easily demonstrated with an example .",
    "consider the @xmath9 representation @xmath129 .",
    "the possible representations of the first group chain are shown in table  i. for comparison , we also show the representation labels for the first group chain of the original @xmath3 model @xcite in the @xmath8 representation as shown in equation ( [ eq : chain ] ) .",
    "the @xmath49 algebra is labelled by the eigenvalue @xmath130 , the @xmath97 algebra is labelled by @xmath131 and the missing quantum number in going from @xmath97 to @xmath132 is identically zero and is not considered . in each case , the number of allowed states is the same .",
    "what is more , the representation labels are identical .",
    "this is a general result ; the representation labels of the effective groups can be identified with the labels of the original model .",
    "since the third group chain is similar to the first , we discuss it next . recall that it is given by equation ( [ eq : o3 ] ) . following the earlier discussion ,",
    "the allowed @xmath5 representations include every other integer counting down from @xmath16 ; we label them by the quantum number @xmath133 . the decomposition from @xmath5",
    "to @xmath69 follows the normal rule so we have , @xmath134 however , as above , we only consider @xmath124 non - negative and divisible by three .",
    "the results for @xmath129 are shown in table  ii .",
    "we have seven states as in the previous group chain .",
    "the multiplicities of the @xmath69 representations are the same for both group chains ; in each case we have @xmath135 .",
    "the left half of the table shows the result for the @xmath8 representation of the third group chain shown in equation ( [ eq : chain ] ) . @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath97 representations are labelled by @xmath136 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "we again find that the group labels are the same .",
    "we conclude by considering the second group chain .",
    "we are constrained to select only those representations which are symmetric in @xmath10 . to do this",
    "it is convenient to think of this group chain as @xmath137 where each number labels the representation of the group above it",
    ". then our states are @xmath138 with @xmath139 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath10 group acts to interchange the labels so that the representation which is completely symmetric under this group is @xmath140    we can label the states with three integers @xmath141 such that the states are the symmetric combination of distributing the integers @xmath142 among the eigenvalues @xmath143 .",
    "our representations are then @xmath144 \\nonumber\\\\ l & = & m , m+1,\\ldots,\\left[\\frac{n - m}{2}\\right ] \\label{eq : ineq}\\\\ k & = & n - l - m\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 $ ] is the smallest integer less than or equal to @xmath120 .",
    "this guarantees that the conditions ( [ eq : nval ] ) are satisfied .",
    "it is convenient to define two other labels @xmath146 by equation ( [ eq : ineq ] ) these are both non - negative .",
    "we can now determine the allowed representations for this group chain with @xmath129 .",
    "the seven pairs of values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 are shown in table  iii . also shown",
    "are the representations of the second group chain of equation ( [ eq : chain ] ) which are labelled by two eigenvalues @xmath149 .",
    "as before , the representation labels are identical . in terms of young tableaux ,",
    "the procedure for selecting the allowed representations of @xmath150 is identical to that of finding the allowed representations of @xmath31 @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that within the @xmath9 picture there is a very clear way to find the allowed representations of each group chain .",
    "these labels are identical to those of the original @xmath3 model . at this level ,",
    "the correspondence is exact since the effective group chains give the same numbers of states with the same multiplicities and the same group labels . however , once we try to calculate quantum eigenvalues , we will see that there are differences and this @xmath9 picture will be shown to be a leading order semiclassical approximation .",
    "it is helpful at this stage to describe a classical hamiltonian which can interpolate among the three dynamical symmetries .",
    "one choice is the extended consistent - q hamiltonian @xcite whose classical limit for arbitrary angular momentum is @xcite @xmath151 this depends on two parameters , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the quantity @xmath154 is the classical analogue of @xmath50 .",
    "for zero angular momentum , we have @xmath84 and @xmath75 so the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath155 with @xmath156 where we have made use of the substitution ( [ eq : alphapm ] ) .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eq : cterms ] ) describes vibrations and the second describes quadrupole interactions .",
    "the parameter @xmath157 is related to the more commonly used @xmath153 by the relation @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath130 is a 1-body term which scales as @xmath159 while the quadrupole term is 2-body and scales as @xmath160 .",
    "therefore we have multiplied the first term by @xmath159 @xcite so that both terms scale the same .",
    "this hamiltonian can also be expressed in terms of the intrinsic coordinates defined in equation ( [ eq : alphas ] ) for which we find @xcite @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the hamiltonian for @xmath163 has the reasonably simple form @xmath164 this is clearly @xmath33-independent so it has an @xmath69 symmetry for all values of @xmath152 .",
    "this is enough to ensure integrability because @xmath44 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 are three constants of motion in involution .",
    "the hamiltonian has additional @xmath53 and @xmath5 symmetries at the values @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively .",
    "these limits are called over - integrable . two familiar examples of over - integrable systems in three dimensions are the harmonic oscillator and the coulomb potential . these have @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath169 symmetries respectively @xcite even though the @xmath5 symmetry of spherical rotations is enough to ensure integrability .",
    "another case of interest is @xmath170 and @xmath168 , for which the hamiltonian has a @xmath150 symmetry .",
    "this is not manifest if we consider the hamiltonian in the original coordinates @xmath26 , but a change of variables makes it clear @xcite .",
    "define new coordinates @xmath171 by @xmath172 this transformation is both unitary and canonical .",

    "straightforward algebra leads to @xmath174 where @xmath175 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath176 , so the three @xmath177 constitute a set of independent constants of motion .",
    "their existence implies integrability ; in fact they are precisely the action coordinates of the problem @xcite .",

    "thy are approximately degenerate with values close to @xmath182 .",
    "this corresponds to vibrations near the potential minimum at @xmath113 and @xmath183 which are approximately degenerate @xcite .",
    "we next consider the effect of quantising the classical system discussed above . as a first step we will define boson creation and annihilation operators by reversing equation ( [ eq : dtoa ] ) @xmath184 in general ,",
    "there are ordering ambiguities in going from a classical to a quantum hamiltonian . here a natural ordering suggests itself .",
    "we started with a @xmath3 quantum hamiltonian , found its classical limit and then recognised that there was an effective @xmath9 chain which describes zero angular momentum .",
    "at no point was it necessary to change the ordering of terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we will take the @xmath9 quantum hamiltonian with the same ordering as the original quantum hamiltonian .",
    "the result of quantising equations ( [ eq : cham ] ) and ( [ eq : cterms ] ) is    [ eq : qham ] @xmath185 where @xmath186    it is worth stressing that this quantum hamiltonian was obtained in a three step process .",
    "we first found the classical limit of the @xmath3 model .",
    "we then used a dimensional reduction appropriate for zero angular momentum .",
    "finally , we requantised using a natural ordering .",
    "the effect of these three steps is formally the same as substituting @xmath187 in the original hamiltonian .",
    "we know that these substitutions are inconsistent because heisenberg s uncertainty principle implies that two noncommuting variables can not be simultaneously equal to zero .",
    "the error is in the requantisation since we should include the effects of the zero point motion of the three neglected degrees of freedom .",
    "these contribute in the next to leading order term in @xmath188 ( since @xmath189 @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion is that we have defined a new quantum problem of lower dimension whose solution is a semi - classical approximation to the original @xmath3 problem . in reference",

    "this result agrees exactly with the result for the original @xmath3 vibrational limit .",
    "this is not a general result but arises because there are no ordering ambiguities in our choice of hamiltonian .",
    "consider the more common choice for a vibrational classical hamiltonian in @xmath195 dimensions ; @xmath196 .",
    "its quantum energies are @xmath197 . in this case , neglecting degrees of freedom would result in a discrepancy in the second term .",
    "we will see that such higher order discrepancies are the rule , not the exception .",
    "as mentioned , the semiclassical limit is obtained for large @xmath16 .",
    "all group labels are of order @xmath16 , so the eigenvalues of the quantum hamiltonian ( ( [ eq : qham ] ) have leading order terms which are quadratic in the group labels and the next order terms are linear .",
    "we next consider the third group chain which corresponds to @xmath198 . in that case , @xmath199 where the quantum generators @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 are obtained by applying the substitution ( [ eq : atod ] ) to the classical generators given in equation ( [ eq : so3gen ] ) .",
    "we then have @xmath203 so that @xmath204 the result for the original model is @xmath205 where @xmath136 and @xmath131 label the @xmath83 and @xmath97 representations , respectively . recalling the identification of @xmath133 and @xmath124 with @xmath136 and @xmath131 , we see that this is a leading order approximation to the energies .",
    "it is possible to make an argument about the next order term for the energies of this dynamical symmetry .",
    "consideration of the radial schrdinger equation in @xmath195 dimensions gives the semi - classical approximation for the eigenvalues of the @xmath206 casimir operator @xcite @xmath207 where @xmath133 is the integer which labels the @xmath206 representation .",
    "the special case of three dimensions gives the well known langer modification @xcite @xmath208 this disagrees with the exact result by a factor of @xmath209 , which is a third order term .",
    "the @xmath210 factor in equation ( [ eq : sod ] ) can be thought of as arising from turning points and their phase space generalisations @xcite .",
    "we can then interpret equation ( [ eq : o3en ] ) as @xmath211 with @xmath212 .",
    "this agrees with equation ( [ eq : o3en ] ) in the first two terms and the dimension @xmath195 only enters into the second leading term . to account for the suppressed degrees of freedom",
    ", it is reasonable to add 3 to the dimension . substituting @xmath213 into formula ( [ eq : o3appr ] ) gives @xmath214 as promised , this agrees with the original result ( [ eq : o6en ] ) for the leading two terms . in practise",
    ", this is sufficient since constants are unimportant when calculating the differences between energies .",
    "however , it should be stressed that this is only a plausibility argument and is not rigorous .",
    "we next discuss the energy eigenvalues of the second dynamical symmetry .",
    "its classical hamiltonian , in the coordinates @xmath215 , is given by equation ( [ eq : hu1u1 ] ) .",
    "we quantise by replacing these variables by creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the hamiltonian is then a function of the group casimir operators .",
    "these are @xmath216 operators whose eigenvalues are integers .",
    "we then obtain the energies @xmath217 we can also obtain this by a direct semiclassical approximation of equation ( [ eq : hu1u1 ] ) by substituting @xmath218 which is appropriate for complex phase space @xcite . it is interesting to note that in this situation the semiclassical approximation is exact .",
    "however there are still semiclassical errors arising from the dimensional reduction as shown in the next paragraph .    expressing this in terms of @xmath147 and @xmath148",
    "defined in equation ( [ eq : pq ] ) leads to @xmath219 the exact result for the @xmath31 limit of the original model is @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath124 label the @xmath31 representation .",
    "earlier it was argued that @xmath147 and @xmath148 can be identified with @xmath221 and @xmath124 so we see that the previous two formulae agree to leading order .",
    "an important point is that the approximation for all the group chains is valid if @xmath16 is large but with no added constraint .",
    "therefore , this procedure reproduces , approximately , the entire spectrum for a given value of @xmath16 .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of reference @xcite where the approximate energies are valid for @xmath16 large and for the other quantum numbers much smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "this reproduces the energies of the low - lying states but not of the entire spectrum .    in principle",
    ", it should be possible to derive the next order terms to the energies by more sophisticated semiclassical arguments .",
    "however , for our purposes it is not important since the leading order terms are sufficient to identify the quantum states with the effective group representations .",
    "it is this correspondence which is the central result of this paper .",
    "the point which is established in this paper is that if a hamiltonian has a group structure and is block diagonal , then at least one of the blocks may have a simpler effective group structure .",
    "this was motivated by studying the classical mechanics for which the effective group chains are unambiguous .",
    "the quantum mechanics is a little more troublesome since it is inconsistent to completely ignore degrees of freedom ; their zero point motions can be significant in understanding the quantum structure .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that it is possible to requantise within the picture of the effective group structure .",
    "arguments about the required point group symmetry of the states limit the allowed representations so that the number of states is the same as in the original model .",
    "furthermore , we can identify the representation labels of the effective groups with the labels of the original groups .",
    "therefore , at this level even the quantum mechanics of the effective groups is unambiguous ; it is completely consistent to identify quantum states with representations of the lower dimensional effective groups . only at the point of calculating quantum energies",
    "is there a problem . because we have not consistently accounted for the missing degrees of freedom ,",
    "there are higher order corrections to the energies derived here .",
    "the interesting problem of how to get the higher order terms remains .",
    "this is a useful result because it means that we have a simple understanding of the @xmath8 quantum states .",
    "they can be defined in a two dimensional space and their dynamical symmetries have a clear , intuitive interpretation .",
    "the case of zero angular momentum has also been of interest in studying chaos @xcite since the two dimensional nature of the classical motion makes the analysis of the classical dynamics simpler .",
    "it is therefore useful to understand the nature of the possible symmetries in the reduced problem .",
    "it is also possible to calculate quantum energies away from the dynamical symmetry limits within this effective group picture .",
    "for example , it is quite simple to diagonalise a general hamiltonian in a basis of @xmath53 eigenstates .",
    "this has been done and the results will be discussed in a subsequent publication .",
    "there are two interesting features of the ibm model which will probably be easier to understand for zero angular momentum .",
    "the first is that there is a suppression of chaos for a family of hamiltonians between the @xmath31 and @xmath49 limits @xcite .",
    "we can now try to explain it as a property of the effective model between the @xmath150 and @xmath53 dynamical symmetries .",
    "the other feature is that the ibm has a partial dynamical symmetry @xcite .",
    "this term describes a situation in which the hamiltonian does not have any symmetry and yet a subset of its quantum eigenstates do .",
    "this affects the classical dynamics by reducing the extent of chaos @xcite .",
    "a semiclassical understanding of this effect might be possible for zero angular momentum for which the partial @xmath31 symmetry becomes a simpler partial @xmath150 symmetry .",
    "more generally , this may serve as a useful starting point to study the effects of classical chaos on collective nuclear structure .",
    "an interesting point is that the @xmath9 model discussed here is equivalent to the three level lipkin model @xcite in the case where the number of fermions equals the number of single particle states in each level .",
    "it is amusing to note that this model , which provides a phenomenological tool for the study of shell effects , might actually have a physical realisation in collective nuclei .",
    "however , unlike the usual studies involving the lipkin model , we have the additional constraint of being in a symmetric @xmath10 representation .",
    "the lipkin model has been studied in the context of chaos @xcite but without explicit reference to its dynamical symmetries .",
    "this idea might also apply in other systems .",
    "for example , there exist models of triatomic molecules @xcite based on assuming a @xmath222 algebra and insisting on an @xmath5 subalgebra .",
    "there are various dynamical symmetries , some of which involve an @xmath169 algebra . insisting on the @xmath8 representation of @xmath5 limits the allowed @xmath169 representations .",
    "then the quantum states can be specified in terms of one fewer quantum number so there is a dimensional reduction of one . it might be that this situation is also described by an effective group chain , but this must be worked out in detail",
    ". it would also be interesting to see if this idea can be applied to fermionic systems for which it is difficult to refer to the classical limit .",
