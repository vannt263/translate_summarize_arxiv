    "as  increases energy from the z peak to the w pair threshold , new opportunities in searches for physics beyond the standard model are presented .",
    "the  1.5 run , which consists of nearly @xmath0 of data per experiment at energies of 130 and 136  gev , gives an opportunity to explore unprecedented energy regimes in @xmath1 collisions for evidence of compositeness , fourth generation fermions , and supersymmetry .",
    "topologically , many signatures for new physics at  have similar components and similar detector requirements .",
    "missing energy is at the heart of many searches for new physics , and so accurate energy measurement and detector hermeticity are essential .",
    "tracking and calorimetry for jet reconstruction , and identification of leptons and photons are necessary to reconstruct signatures of new physics .    as  moves away from the z peak , the physics opportunities for search analyses increase , and the search conditions change .",
    "signatures for new physics have lower background from z decays , and the more exotic backgrounds from four fermion processes , ww and @xmath2 , play an increased role . although the cross sections are lower than those at  2 , the event topologies are very similar to those of signal processes .",
    "the highest production cross section comes from two photon events .",
    "however , these events normally have characteristics very different from those of signatures for new physics , so they are mostly easily eliminated from search analyses .",
    "four fermion processes are an important background for searches at lep , especially for searches for supersymmetry and the higgs boson .",
    "an understanding of the rate and characteristics of these events is thus essential . at  1.5 ,",
    "the dominant four fermion process comes from the production of an on - shell z boson and a virtual photon .",
    "the  collaboration have reported an excess of four fermion final state events with high multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "the  collaboration  @xcite in an analysis sensitive to both high and low multiplicity four fermion final states , observe rates consistent with standard model expectations obtained with the fermisv program  @xcite .",
    "the results are given in table  [ table - fourfermion ] .",
    "evidence for compositeness may appear in direct searches for new particles , or through anomalies in standard model processes .",
    "results of searches for single and pair production of excited leptons are reported by +  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "excited leptons usually decay radiatively , which gives a signal topology for pair production of two leptons and two energetic photons . for excited neutrinos",
    ", the radiative decay may be forbidden , and in that case , the excited neutrino decays to a lepton and a w , and the signal topologies are determined by the w decays ( i.e. , combinations of leptons and jets with rates determined by the branching ratios ) .",
    "efficiencies for the search are typically between 45 and 60% , with the @xmath3 search having a lower efficiency than @xmath4 and @xmath5 searches .",
    "the production cross section for pair production of excited leptons can be as large as 8  pb , and combined with the high efficiency of the analyses , limits were set on excited lepton masses to nearly the kinematic limit , as shown in table  [ table - lstar ] .",
    "single production of excited leptons results in events with two leptons and a photon , @xmath6 .",
    "the production cross section for this process is low ( @xmath7 0.2  pb ) , except for excited electrons , which can have a t - channel enhancement of the cross section .",
    "the results of the searches can be interpreted as limits on the coupling between excited leptons and their partners , which is related to the compositeness scale , as a function of the mass of the excited lepton .",
    "._mass limits in gev for excited leptons from the search for @xmath8 .",
    "results are given assuming radiative decays , except for neutrinos , where the decay @xmath9 has also been considered .",
    "[ table - lstar ] _ [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the search for neutralinos is complementary to the chargino search , since the highest neutralino production cross sections ( @xmath10 7  pb ) occur in the higgsino region , where the chargino selection efficiency is lower due to the near mass degeneracy of the chargino and neutralino .",
    "neutralino searches at  1.5 focused on associated production of @xmath11@xmath12   where @xmath13@xmath12  @xmath14 ; thus the neutralino signatures are determined by the z branching ratios , leading to topologies of acoplanar jets or leptons , with missing energy and mass .",
    "efficiencies as high as 30% are attainable when the mass difference ( @xmath11 - @xmath12  ) is 10 - 15  gev .",
    "no evidence for neutralino production was found by the  experiments .",
    "squarks are usually expected to be too heavy , and the cross section too small , to be of interest for current searches at  , except under special circumstances . in the case of the @xmath15",
    ", large yukawa coupling leads to large off - diagonal terms in the mass matrix , causing mixing between the left and right states .",
    "thus , there can be a large mass splitting between the two @xmath15 states , so that the lightest @xmath15 could be detectable at  energies .",
    "the production cross section for @xmath16 depends on the mixing angle .",
    "the topology expected for stop decays is a pair of acoplanar jets , as each stop squark decays to a charm quark and a neutralino .",
    "typical search efficiencies are between 50 and 64% , for a mass difference ( @xmath17-@xmath12 ) of @xmath18 . searches by  ,  ,  , and   found no candidates , and limits were placed on the stop mass as a function of neutralino mass and mixing angle . in the most optimistic case , where @xmath19=0 and the production cross section is highest , limits on the @xmath15 mass of 52 - 57 gev are set by the  experiments .",
    "the topology for pair production of sleptons , @xmath20@xmath12@xmath21@xmath12 is a pair of acoplanar leptons , accompanied by missing energy and mass .",
    "typical search efficiencies are about 70% , for @xmath22 s and @xmath23 s , when the @xmath12  is @xmath10 30  gev lighter than the slepton .",
    "efficiencies fall when the mass difference between the slepton and @xmath12   decreases , and are generally lower for @xmath24 s .",
    "no candidates were selected in the   and   analyses , which expected approximately one event from background processes , and limits can be placed on the slepton mass as a function of neutralino mass . because the production cross sections for smuons and staus are low ( @xmath250.5  pb )",
    ", the limits set at  1 are not improved . however , for selectrons , the production cross section can be enhanced by t - channel neutralino exchange , if the neutralino is light enough and contains a significant gaugino component . in that case , improved limits can be set on the mass of the selectron , to 53  gev .",
    "the limits on the masses of the supersymmetric particles can be interpreted in the parameter space of the mssm .",
    "chargino and neutralino masses depend on three parameters ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . assuming a heavy @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , improved limits on @xmath31 and @xmath32 for two values of tan@xmath33 are shown in figure  [ fig - mu_m2 ] .",
    "an interesting result is derived by   for the combination of  1 and  1.5 results  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutralino is not bound for all values of tan@xmath33 from the  1 or  1.5 results , if taken separately . however ,",
    "if the results are combined , they complement each other such that the mass of the lightest neutralino is restricted to be @xmath34  12.8  gev , for all tan@xmath33 , as shown in figure  [ fig - mchi ] .",
