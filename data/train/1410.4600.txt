    "in recent years , fibre - optic connections in telecommunication networks have proven to be suitable for frequency comparisons and frequency distribution with high stability over long distances . in general the frequency of either an ultra - stable continuous - wave ( cw ) laser or a stable microwave reference",
    "is transmitted over an optical fibre and received at the remote site .",
    "several experiments  @xcite have shown that frequency comparisons at or below the current accuracy level of the best atomic frequency references , a few times 10@xmath1  @xcite , are feasible over long - haul fibre connections .",
    "for example , the optical frequency of the 1s-2s transition in atomic hydrogen was recently measured with respect to a remote cs frequency standard with 4.5@xmath2 relative uncertainty , employing a 920 km long fibre - optic link performing at the @xmath3 uncertainty level  @xcite .",
    "fibre - optic methods for remote frequency comparison can provide significantly better stability than current satellite - based methods . these include two - way satellite time and frequency transfer ( twstft )  @xcite and ( carrier - phase ) common - view global positioning system ( ( cp/)cv - gps ) comparisons  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy limits of satellite based methods are on the order of @xmath4 at one day  @xcite , which is already insufficient to compare state - of - the - art cesium fountain clocks operating at less than @xmath5 uncertainty level  @xcite",
    ".    plans for high - resolution laser spectroscopy experiments at vu university amsterdam laserlab and at van swinderen institute , university of groningen , would be greatly facilitated by direct frequency comparisons over an optical fibre - link at stability levels better than @xmath6 .",
    "for this purpose , a @xmath0 km fibre - optic connection between both laboratories has been established using a @xmath7 km dwdm channel provided by surfnet . the top part of fig .",

    "the optical path between vu university amsterdam and van swinderen institute groningen is marked in green .",
    "the bottom part shows the details of the optical path .",
    "the link consists of two unidirectional fibres .",
    "interferometric detection and active compensation of fibre length changes  @xcite is therefore not possible .",
    "however , it is possible to create a bidirectional path in the optical fibre , and implement a compensation system  @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that , in contrast to some of the other frequency comparison links  @xcite , our link is part of a carrier - grade dwdm optical network in which the fibre is shared with other users , and several other wavelength channels are simultaneously used for data transfer .",

    "the use of a standard dwdm channel enables us to characterise the performance of unidirectional transmission of optical frequency references in public transport networks carrying live network traffic .",
    "it also allows a systematic study of environmental conditions on the link stability , such as soil temperature variations , which is the main aim of this work .",
    "unidirectional frequency transfer will be useful for institutions and industries which require accurate and reliable time and frequency references , e.g. for calibration of equipment .",

    "several physical processes can lead to phase ( and thus frequency ) variations in fibre - optic links .    at short time",
    "scales ( @xmath16 sec ) environmental vibrations couple to the fibre and can therefore cause path length variations , e.g. via stress - induced refractive index variation , which may occur at frequencies up to tens of khz . at time scales longer than 1 s , significant phase variations also occur because of thermal expansion of the fibre and thermally induced changes in the refractive index .",
    "these variations are typically slow and , for a fibre which is installed mainly underground in an outdoor environment , they are mostly affected by the diurnal and seasonal soil temperature cycles  @xcite .",
    "our work is focused on the understanding of the long - term stability of fibre links in relation to such temperature variations .",
    "the phase variations due to a time - varying temperature @xmath17 are @xmath18 we can express the relative length variations of the fibre as a function of temperature as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fibre . furthermore it is customary to write @xmath21 with @xmath22 the thermo - optic coefficient . note that both @xmath20 and @xmath22 are weakly dependent on temperature , which we ignore here .",
    "a typical ( room - temperature ) value of the thermal expansion coefficient of the fibre glass is @xmath23/ @xmath24c  @xcite .",
    "the thermo - optic coefficient has a typical value of @xmath25/@xmath24c  @xcite , and is therefore the main cause of phase variations due to temperature changes .",
    "similar effects due to varying air pressure are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller  @xcite and have therefore not been included in the model .",
    "considering the heat flux in isotropic media ( soil ) for a vertical temperature gradient and varying temperature , and modelling the temperature variation as a sinusoidal periodic signal , van der and  @xcite derive the equation for the temperature of the soil at a certain depth @xmath26 and time @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average temperature at the surface ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 is the amplitude of the temperature variation at the surface with period @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is an arbitrary time offset .",

    "in order to characterise the frequency stability of the fibre link , two different methods are used . the first method",
    "consists of the one - way transmission of a c - band - wavelength cw laser , locked to a mode of an er@xmath8-doped fibre frequency comb laser in amsterdam . in groningen , the transmitted laser frequency",
    "is measured using a similar frequency comb laser .",
    "both frequency combs are locked to gps - disciplined atomic clocks .",

    "the second method employs a closed fibre loop amsterdam ",
    "amsterdam . in this case",
    "the laser frequency can be compared with itself after its roundtrip through the fibre loop .",
    "the second method takes advantage of the fact that the laser frequency instability on the time scale of the measurement is much smaller than the instabilities introduced in the fibre loop .",

    "part of the light is used in a frequency comparison against the local optical frequency standard ( menlo systems fc1500 ) , while the other part of the light is sent back to amsterdam ( received power 06 dbm ) . as pointed out above , the comparison of the frequency of the light after the roundtrip with the cw laser source reveals the noise contribution from the fibre link .",
    "both optical frequency combs are locked to rubidium ( rb ) frequency standards ( srs fs725 ) , which are disciplined to the 1 pps output of gps receivers ( amsterdam : trimble acutime 2000 , groningen : navsync cw46 ) .",

    "the frequency comb laser and counters are frequency referenced to the rb - standard .",
    "two series of measurements have been performed on the fibre link , namely an optical - versus - gps measurement for which the optical frequency is measured simultaneously at amsterdam and groningen and compared , and a roundtrip measurement at the amsterdam site ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fibre_network_experimental_setup ] ) .",
    "it is known that soil temperature variations of the fibre may lead to significant frequency instability ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "we present a model to describe and predict the influence of soil temperature variations on the frequency stability of underground fibre links .",
    "the results of the temperature model are compared with actual soil temperature and link stability measurements .",
    "apart from the instability contributed by the fibre link , the stability of the frequency transfer is limited by three sources .",
    "first , the stability of the frequency comb laser is limited by the rb / gps rf reference oscillator used to control the parameters of the comb .",
    "this reference has a specified relative instability of @xmath53 at 1 second and below @xmath54 between @xmath55 and @xmath56 seconds , with a minimum around @xmath57 .",
    "this long - term frequency instability is transferred to the cw link laser through the various rf locks in the setup .",
    "the rf locks themselves also contribute to the frequency instability , which we assess as follows . using a second , similar , cw laser ( rio orion )",
    "locked to the frequency comb , and employing the virtual beat note technique  @xcite , the combined instability of the locking electronics is determined to be @xmath58 at 1 second .",
    "thus , on time scales longer than 1s , the rf noise is effectively averaged out so that its influence on the link measurements may be neglected .",
    "a second source of instability plays a role in the roundtrip measurements , for which a frequency drift of the laser source may lead to an apparent frequency shift of the ( delayed ) light transmitted by the fibre loop . considering the 3.2 ms roundtrip propagation delay of the light over the fibre link ,",
    "the ( linear ) drift of the frequency standard ( @xmath59 at 1 s ) only plays a role at the level of @xmath60 at 1 s , decreasing as @xmath61 , the inverse of the counter gate time , due to the fractional time overlap @xmath62 between reference and roundtrip light in the frequency comparison .",
    "this is one order of magnitude smaller than the typically measured link stability at 1 s , and averages down more rapidly with increasing @xmath63 .    for the optical - versus - gps comparison ,",
    "a third source of instability is due to the fact that the rb clocks in amsterdam and groningen are independently locked to gps time .",
    "small intrinsic phase differences between gps signals , received at geographically separated locations , thus propagate through the frequency locks , and may manifest itself as additional noise in the link frequency measurement .",
    "the intrinsic frequency transfer stability of a fibre link is best measured on a closed loop , so that the frequency of the input signal can be directly compared with that of the roundtrip signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : roundtrip_stability-120706_vs_130930 ] shows the results of two roundtrip stability measurements .",
    "the first measurement is based on a 13-hour time series of frequency measurements acquired on 2012 - 07 - 06 , using the free - space aom unit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fibre_network_experimental_setup_roundtrip_measurement ] ) while recording with the agilent 53230a . for this dataset the absolute frequency of the roundtrip optical signal was calculated and used to determine the overlapping allan deviation ( odev ) .        to compare the measurement with the soil temperature model , statistics on the scale of several days are needed .",
    "therefore a longer roundtrip stability measurement took place from 2013 - 09 - 30 to 2013 - 10 - 09 , using the fibre - coupled aom while recording with the k+k fmx50 counter .",
    "this measurement contains a few periods during which the beat signal was too low for the fmx50 input circuits to record properly , leading to frequency outliers .",
    "outliers were removed according to chauvenets criterion ( @xmath64 , 4102 datapoints ( 0.52% of the total set ) removed ) and were replaced with the median of the dataset .",
    "we have verified that the odev statistics are not influenced significantly by this operation .      in the previous section we established that for averaging periods of more than 10 s",
    "the frequency transfer instability of the link is @xmath65 .",
    "given the stability of the laboratory frequency standards ( rb clocks ) it is therefore to be expected that a direct measurement of the link laser frequency at the remote site ( groningen ) yields the mutual clock stability . during the 2012 measurement session ,",
    "the absolute laser frequency at the remote site was recorded .",
    "the result of this measurement , together with the roundtrip stability and the stability of the link laser lock frequency are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : link_measurement_120706 ] .        the link laser frequency was determined with respect to the frequency comb , taking into account variations of @xmath45and @xmath46 .",
    "the determination of the absolute laser frequency is limited by the resolution of the @xmath45counter to @xmath66/s .",
    "the maximum observable roundtrip instability is therefore about 1@xmath2/s .",
    "the observed instability is significantly higher , showing that the fibre may already influence the roundtrip stability at the second time scale .",
    "the frequency of the laser used for the characterisation of the remote link was determined with respect to the nearest frequency comb mode .",
    "together with the mode number determination , this directly delivers the remote absolute optical frequency . as can be seen in fig .",
    "7 , the link laser frequency instability at the remote site is much larger than the total roundtrip instability .",
    "therefore , the local frequency references are the limiting factor .",
    "this means that we have effectively performed a frequency comparison between the gps referenced rb atomic clocks over the fibre link .",
    "the measured performance is slightly worse than expected based on the allan variance graph in the datasheet ( @xmath67 at @xmath68 s ) of the clocks .",
    "this is probably due to imperfect gps reception , and uncorrelated frequency noise of the fibre combs used in this experiment .",
    "based on coarse estimates we expected ( soil ) temperature fluctuations to have a major influence on the passive stability of the fibre link .",
    "the royal netherlands meteorological institute ( knmi ) provided us with soil temperature measurements taken at the cabauw site ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : surfnet_fibre_network ] ) .",
    "temperatures are measured at depths of 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 20 , 30 and 50 cm every 12 seconds and averaged over 10 minute intervals .",
    "out of five knmi locations the site at cabauw is the only location for which soil temperature data with such high temporal resolution is available in the netherlands .",
    "the provided datasets consist of one set covering the 9 day link measurement with a 12 second time interval in october 2013  @xcite , and a 2 year dataset ( 2011 , 2012 ) with a 10 minute interval  @xcite .",
    "equation   is used to convert these temperature series to frequency deviations expected on a @xmath0 km fibre link with the given thermal expansion and thermo - optic coefficients . in the next sections we use these reference data to compare the link stability with the soil temperature model , eq .  .      the raw frequency data from the 9-day link stability measurement",
    "is compared to the frequency deviations as derived from the knmi soil temperature dataset over the same time period .",
    "the first question that needs to be addressed is to what extent such a comparison , correlating temperature effects measured in locations separated by tens of kilometres , is meaningful .",
    "the cabauw measurement site ( fig .",
    "1 ) is located more than 40 km south of the ( geographically ) 200 km long trajectory of the fibre . therefore the exact trends in soil temperature at the cabauw site and along the fibre link can differ , due to local variations in solar irradiation and precipitation .",
    "nevertheless , significant temperature correlations are expected as the different locations are relatively close , as seen from a meteorological and climatological point of view .",
    "slope , which indicates that on shorter time scales temperature noise is significantly more prominent in the knmi measurements than in the temperature - dependent link stability . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : roundtrip_comparison_measurement_knmi ] shows the roundtrip stability in comparison to the fibre - link stability calculated from the knmi soil temperature data .",
    "knmi aims at a relative accuracy among sensors of 0.01 k and an absolute accuracy of 0.1 k. the noise in the soil temperature measurements amounts to a few mk .",
    "more accurate soil temperature observations will be difficult to make , let alone capturing all relevant variations along the optical path .",
    "all stabilities derived from soil temperature show a @xmath69 slope for shorter time scales , which indicates the presence of white noise in the temperature measurements that does not appear in the fibre link instability .",
    "the noise levels at these time scales obscure frequency drift due to the daily temperature cycle .",
    "this cycle leads to the rising slope at longer time scales , with a local maximum at an averaging time of half a day . on even longer time scales",
    ", this instability cycle continues with a one - day period , and with local maxima decreasing in height over time .",
    "this is most clearly seen in the surface temperature curve .",
    "the measured roundtrip stability curve shows averaging at short time scales less than 100 s ,",
    "while at time scales larger than 1000 s frequency drifts due to the diurnal temperature cycle dominate the instability .",
    "the origin of the level of instability at time scales less than 4@xmath70 s remains unclear .",
    "possible causes are the several hundreds of meters of the fibre link located inside buildings , which are subject to significant and relatively fast temperature variations ( due to e.g. airconditioning systems ) , while other factors like stress induced frequency fluctuations can not be entirely ruled out . for averaging times larger than 4@xmath70 s , the link measurement shows qualitative agreement with the knmi data at depths of 2030 cm .",
    "the correlation between soil temperature and link frequency drift can be inferred more directly from the temperature and frequency measurement time series . to this end ,",
    "the roundtrip frequency deviations from the aom frequency , @xmath40 , are compared to the frequency deviations @xmath71 due to soil temperature @xmath72 at depth @xmath13 , estimated using eq .  .",
    "both datasets are averaged over two - hour windows to reduce noise levels .",
    "figure  [ fig : roundtrip_time_series ] shows the raw data of the nine - day link measurement in comparison with @xmath71 at 20 cm and 30 cm depth ( 2 hour averages ) .",
    "the depth at which the fibre link is buried is not precisely known , and it furthermore may vary along the path of the link .",
    "an estimate of the effective depth of the link may be obtained by assigning a weighting factor @xmath73 to each time series @xmath71 , and minimising ( by least squares fitting ) the difference @xmath74 between the measured and calculated frequency deviations @xmath75 the frequency offset parameter @xmath76 is needed to include a systematic offset between the link measurement data and the knmi data .",
    "such an offset may be caused by an overall relative temperature change between the fibre link path and the cabauw site .",
    "figure  [ fig : roundtrip_time_fit_parameters ] shows the variation of the fit parameters @xmath77 and @xmath76 over time .",
    "these parameters and their time dependence are obtained as follows .",
    "first , all input data ( i.e. the measured frequency deviations and the frequency deviations estimated from soil temperature measurements ) are averaged with a one - hour window .",
    "of the averaged data sets , a 24-hour subset is taken ( labeled by the median of the time stamps in the set ) , for which the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath76 are found by least - squares fitting .",
    "this last step is repeated for a 24-hour subset which is offset by six hours with respect to the previous subset , until the entire data set is covered . from fig .",
    "[ fig : roundtrip_time_fit_parameters ] it follows that best agreement is found for an average fibre depth of about 30 cm .",
    "the least - squares fit method yields solutions which are generally well aligned in phase with the measured data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roundtrip_time_series ] ) . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : roundtrip_time_series ] also shows that the agreement between the amplitude of the frequency deviations at 30 cm depth and the measured data is poor .     for the most important depths ; the @xmath77 found for the other depths are negligibly small .",
    "averages and standard deviations over this dataset are @xmath78 @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . ]    in the time series of the link measurement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roundtrip_time_series ] ) the frequency deviations before 3 october and after 6 october appear to follow the predictions based on knmi data , while between 3 october and 6 october the curves seem to be substantially less correlated .",
    "this discrepancy might be linked to the fact that during this period , the fibre - link path received considerably more precipitation on 3 october 2013 than the measurement site at cabauw  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "solar irradiation differed substantially from day to day between cabauw and the fibre link in this period  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that this led to local soil temperature variations along the fibre link and , thus , to the observed discrepancy .",
    "this behaviour illustrates the limited power of the temperature model for predicting or estimating instantaneous frequency variations based on soil temperature measurements .",
    "soil temperature data can be used to predict the long - term stability of fibre links , but it can be burdensome to obtain or construct long historical records .",
    "for example in 1961 soil temperature was measured 3 times a day  @xcite . also , soil temperature is less often measured at meteorological measurement sites than other quantities . in the netherlands knmi",
    "has such data available for only four sites . in case of scarce soil temperature data , the sinusoidal soil temperature model ( eq .  ) can be used to construct an artificial temperature cycle by superposition of a diurnal and an annual temperature cycle , which can be used to estimate the frequency transfer stability of fibre links .",
    "such models can also be used to predict frequency transfer stability for various types of soil .",
    "the amplitude of the diurnal temperature variation itself varies approximately sinusoidally during the year , and is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the average diurnal temperature variation , @xmath84 is the amplitude of the annual variation of the diurnal amplitude , @xmath85 is the annual period , and @xmath86 is used to shift the temperature cycle to fit the model to the long term measurement data of knmi .",
    "the total annual temperature cycle now becomes @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are given by eq .  , but now with the amplitude @xmath31 of the diurnal variation being a function of time .",
    "we obtain a set of model parameters for eq .   by fitting eq .   to the data from van der and  @xcite as an estimate of the annual variations , and to the data from  @xcite to estimate the cycle of diurnal temperature variations .",

    "the dash - dotted lines indicate the @xmath69 behaviour with a maximum instability of @xmath91 at half a day for the diurnal variation and @xmath92 at half a year for the annual variation . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : soil_temperature_model_measurement ] compares the frequency stability , computed using eq .   and the soil temperature measurement series of 2011 and 2012 , with that obtained from eq .   and the sinusoidal model , eq .  .",
    "the most prominent feature is the discrepancy for 50 cm depth , likely due to fluctuations in weather conditions on long ( days / weeks / months ) time scales , which cause a higher instability at time scales between a day and half a year .",
    "these fluctuations are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : soil_temperature_yearly_fluctuation ] .",
    "this noise also leads to a smoothing of the strong minima in the frequency instability curves , which are a consequence of the sinusoidal temperature behaviour .",
    "we investigated the passive frequency stability of a @xmath0 km carrier - grade , unidirectional fibre link between vu university amsterdam laserlab and van swinderen institute , university of groningen , using a single dwdm channel , and with live optical data traffic present in other dwdm channels .",
    "the observed frequency instability of the link lies in the range @xmath93 to @xmath94 for averaging times 10",
    " 8@xmath95 s. this result implies that such fibre links are well suited to distribute the frequency of commercial rb atomic clocks with negligible loss of accuracy .",
    "a model for thermo - optical fibre length variation was developed which relates frequency variations to soil temperatures as a function of depth .",
    "we employed this model taking actual long - term soil temperature measurements as input , as well as predictions obtained from existing soil temperature models .",
    "we combined link frequency measurements with soil temperature measurements at the knmi cabauw site to show that the observed link stability corresponds to an average fibre depth of about 30 cm .",
    "qualitative agreement is found between the soil temperature model and knmi measurements , while predictions of frequency stability based upon this model agree with actual roundtrip frequency measurements to within an order of magnitude .",
    "although the predictive power of the soil - temperature model is limited , it does provide insight into the relation between soil temperature , fibre - optic path length variations and frequency - transfer stability .",
    "our model thus allows estimating the passive frequency stability of fibre links for averaging times ranging from days to years , and allows to estimate upper bounds on the passive link instability .",
    "such information will be useful for the design of future one - way frequency distribution systems based on underground fibre - optic infrastructure .",
    "the presented results show that soil temperature fluctuations have a large impact on the passive frequency stability of optical carriers over underground fibre links for time scales longer than approximately 1000 seconds .",
    "the results of our study confirm the conclusions of previous work that fibre - optic infrastructure is sufficiently stable for one - way atomic clock frequency distribution over hundreds of kilometres distance , and with @xmath96 relative instability  @xcite .",
    "this figure compares favourably to the stability of commercial gps - disciplined rb clocks .",
    "the residual frequency variations are sufficiently small to back up the local oscillator of gps - referenced clocks with indefinite holdover ( provided a non - gps - referenced master clock is used ) .",
    "this opens up the perspective of a terrestrial `` flywheel '' oscillator , embedded in the fibre - optic telecommunications network , which can be used to back - up gps - referenced oscillators during periods of gps outage .",
