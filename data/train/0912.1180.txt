    "the sf activity , as other galaxy properties , varies systematically with galaxy mass and redshift .",
    "its trend as a function of galaxy mass has been studied in the field at different epochs ( eg .",
    "these works have found a strong and rather tight correlation between current sfr and galaxy stellar mass for field star - forming galaxies at all redshifts out to @xmath5 .",
    "this correlation shifts to progressively higher sfrs at higher @xmath6 , maintaining remarkably its local slope .",
    "these results suggest a gradual decline in the sfr of most galaxies since z@xmath21 - 2 .",
    "the ssfr , measuring the sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass , allows us to study how the ongoing sf contributes to the mass growth for galaxies of different masses , at different times .",
    "lower - mass galaxies have higher ssfrs than higher - mass galaxies @xcite , supporting a scenario in which massive galaxies formed most of their stars earlier and on shorter timescales , while less massive galaxies evolve on longer timescales ( `` downsizing '' ) .",
    "there are several reasons to expect that the sfr - mass and ssfr - mass relations should depend on environment . while fast - acting environmental effects are unlikely to influence the sfr - mass relationship of star - forming galaxies , any physical mechanism slowly affecting the amount of gas available for sf should result in a slowly declining sfr , therefore a different sfr - mass relation with environment .",
    "examples are the loss of halo gas reservoir included in hierarchical galaxy formation models ( `` strangulation '' , @xcite ) , and the interruption of cold gas streams in dense environments that would leave un - fueled galaxies to slowly consume their disk gas @xcite .    in contrast , several works have reported a lack of environmental dependence of the distribution on current sf activity as measured both from optical lines and infrared emission ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) , and others have failed to identify large population of galaxies in `` transition '' from the red sequence to the blue cloud in dense environments @xcite .    however , the relations between sfr and ssfr with mass have not yet been studied in groups and clusters , which should be the most direct way to clearly discriminate between mass and environmental trends .",
    "should the sfr - mass relation be universal , the evolution of the red galaxy fraction would have a galaxy intrinsic origin , and environmental effects such as strangulation could not be relevant .    in this paper",
    "we make a first attempt to investigate this issue by studying galaxies in clusters and groups at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath7 ) using the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) dataset and comparing with field galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "we adopt ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) = ( 70 @xmath11 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) .",
    "values of @xmath12 and sfr are based on the @xcite initial mass function , in the range of mass 0.1 - 125 @xmath13 .",
    "in our analysis , we use 604 spectroscopically confirmed ediscs members of 16 clusters with velocity dispersions @xmath14 and 10 groups ( @xmath15 ) as in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we refer to clusters and groups collectively as `` clusters '' , unless otherwise stated .",
    "ours is effectively an i - band selected sample with high quality multiband optical and near - ir photometry @xcite and spectroscopy ( @xcite , @xcite ) , with a 97% spectroscopic success rate ( number of redshifts / number of spectra ) at the magnitudes used here .",
    "we estimate galaxy stellar masses using photo - z fitting total absolute magnitudes @xcite and the relation between mass - to - light @xmath16 ratio and rest - frame ( @xmath17 ) color for solar metallicity from @xcite , ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the internal accuracy of the measured masses is @xmath20.15_dex_. the spectroscopic magnitude limit ( @xmath19 at @xmath20 and @xmath21 at @xmath22 ) corresponds to a mass limit @xmath23 @xmath13 for galaxies of all colors , and @xmath24 @xmath13 for blue galaxies ( see below for our red / blue limit ) .",
    "to estimate sfrs , we use the ir luminosities of @xcite .",
    "the ir luminosities are derived from _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m imaging , and the observed 24@xmath0 m flux is converted to total ir luminosity using the models of @xcite .",
    "the ir luminosity is converted to @xmath25 according to @xcite : @xmath26 , assuming that the mid - ir emission of the great majority of distant cluster galaxies is powered by starbursts rather than agns , as found by previous studies ( finn et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "the median ir luminosity error is 7% , and is always less than 23% .",
    "the @xmath25 error associated with estimating the ir luminosity from the observed 24@xmath0 m flux ranges from 5 to 22% , depending on the cluster redshift ( finn et al .",
    "the 80% completeness limit of our spitzer data corresponds to a @xmath25 of at @xmath22 and @xmath213 @xmath27 at @xmath20 .",

    "the ssfr is simply @xmath34 .",
    "galaxies without a 24@xmath0 m detection are further divided into red and blue , in order to separate those that can be assumed to be powered by sf ( blue ) from those that could be strongly contaminated by an agn ( red ) . following @xcite ,",
    "the color separation is defined by @xcite : @xmath35    based on visual morphological classifications by @xcite , blue emission - line ( bel ) galaxies and spitzer - detected galaxies have mostly late - type morphologies ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively ) , in agreement with the assumption that they are star - forming .",
    "in addition , a fraction of the rel galaxies could have their [ oii ] powered by a residual low level of sf , instead of being dominated by an agn .    in our dataset",
    ", we currently do not have a way to quantify agn contamination .",
    "external estimates can vary significantly : at low - z , @xcite in their sdss sample found that only @xmath38 of red galaxies with [ oii ] in emission are characterized by sf . at higher redshifts ,",
    "@xcite find a higher fraction of probable star formation - dominated rel systems , up to 30% . in broad agreement with this",
    ", we find that 32% of our rel galaxies have late - type morphologies , while only 50% are ellipticals .",
    "this suggests that at least a third of galaxies in this class are indeed star - forming .",
    "moreover , analyzing the ediscs optical spectra , sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) conclude that most of our rel galaxies are dusty and star - forming .",
    "this agrees with the large population of red star - forming cluster galaxies identified at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "however , since we can not be certain of exactly how many red objects should be considered star - forming , in our analysis we analyze two different cases : in the first case we assume that the [ oii ] emission in _ all _ red galaxies is dominated by an agn , and we exclude them from our analysis . in the second case , we include rel galaxies .",
    "these cases should bracket the real situation occurring in nature .",
    "we compare our results to those for the field at @xmath40 from @xcite , who studied the sfr and the ssfr in field galaxies from the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) .",
    "( noeske 2009 , private communication ) . ]",
    "our method to derive sfrs is similar to theirs . for galaxies with robust 24@xmath0 m detections",
    ", they determined the total sfr by summing the sfr derived from 24@xmath33 data with that derived from the emission lines uncorrected for extinction , as we do . for galaxies below the 24@xmath0 m detection limit",
    ", they estimated extinction - corrected sfrs from emission line fluxes using the observed average balmer decrement , for a fixed @xmath41 value .",
    "this method overestimates the extinction in galaxies with low sfrs @xcite . to avoid systematic effects due to a different dust treatment for field and cluster galaxies",
    ", we de - corrected the aegis emission - line data using their value of extinction , then we applied our own method of dust correction to their datapoints .",
    "our comparison with the field is meaningful only for those galaxies with mass and sfr above the highest between our and aegis limits , where we are sure both samples are unbiased .",

    "this leaves us with a final cluster sample of 127 galaxies , and a field sample of 426 galaxies .",
    "we show the sfr - mass relation in different environments in fig .",
    "[ sfr ] , where only 24@xmath33 and bel galaxies are considered star - forming .",
    "we calculate the median values of sfr and of ssfr , and the 25 and 75 percentiles .    from fig .",
    "[ sfr ] , we note a change with redshift , in both the field and clusters , as the average sfrs at @xmath45 are shifted to higher values compared to @xmath46 at the same mass .    the main result of fig .",
    "[ sfr ] is that , at both redshifts , cluster sfrs are on average systematically lower than field sfrs at the same mass .",
    "clusters have in general lower median sfrs than the field .",
    "this is due to a population of cluster galaxies lying below the field 25 percentile , that represent 34% of the whole cluster population , thus a @xmath47% excess of galaxies with `` reduced '' sfr for their mass .    to avoid the influence of the mass distribution",
    ", we performed 1000 monte carlo simulations extracting randomly from the field sample a subsample with the same mass distribution as the clusters .",
    "the sfr distributions are shown as histograms in fig .",
    "[ sfr ] . at @xmath42 , due to poor number statistics95% in 80% of the cases . ]",
    ", a kolmogorov - smirnov test can not reject the null hypothesis of similar sfr distributions in clusters and field , finding a probability less than 90% in 54% of the cases and a probability @xmath48 in 29% of the simulations . at @xmath3",
    ", the k - s test rejects the hypothesis of similar cluster and field distributions with a @xmath4995% probability in 87% of the simulations .",
    "we note that , although a correlation is evident when considering galaxies over a wide mass range ( see bottom windows in fig .",
    "[ sfr ] ) , the sfr - mass relation is flat above our mass limit .",
    "a spearman test yields a significant positive correlation only for the field at @xmath3 ( 99.9% ) , and no correlation in all other cases .    in fig .",
    "[ sfr2 ] , we show the results considering also rel galaxies as star - forming .",
    "we recall that at least for some of them the [ oii ] emission likely arises from ongoing sf .",
    "now the difference between field and clusters is more striking , and becomes progressively more pronounced towards more massive galaxies .",
    "50% of the whole cluster population have sfrs below the field 25 percentile , therefore @xmath50% have `` reduced '' sfrs for their mass compared to the field .",
    "the k - s test on mass - matched cluster and field samples rejects the null hypothesis of similarity between the two environments with a probability of 100% ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath3 ) in all the simulations ( see histograms in fig .",
    "[ sfr2 ] ) . as before ,",
    "no sfr - mass correlation is detected by a spearman test , except for the field at @xmath3 at 99.9% .",
    "our results highlight a change in the sfr - mass relation with environment . to quantify this change ,",
    "we compute the mean sfr in our mass - matched simulations , therefore removing the effects of different mass distributions .",
    "including both redshift bins , for the sample of 24@xmath33+bel galaxies the mean sfr in clusters is 1.35@xmath510.15 times lower than in the field . including rel galaxies , it is 1.63@xmath510.20 times lower than the field .    in figs .",
    "[ ssfr ] and [ ssfr2 ] , we show the results for the ssfr - mass relation .",
    "cluster and field galaxies follow a qualitatively similar decreasing trend of ssfr with mass ( spearman anticorrelation probability always @xmath52 ) , but cluster galaxies tend to have a lower ssfr than field galaxies of similar mass , as expected from the results discussed above .",
    "a k - s test confirms this when red galaxies are included ( probabilities always @xmath48 ) . for 24@xmath33+bel galaxies ,",
    "the differences are not statistically significant , with the k - s test giving a probability @xmath48 only in 53% of the simulations at @xmath3 , and only in 4% of simulations at @xmath42 . including both redshift bins ,",
    "the ratio of average ssfr between field and clusters above our mass limit is 1.20@xmath510.14 for 24@xmath33+bel galaxies , and 1.31@xmath510.17 for all galaxies .",
    "this result shows that , in all environments , the mass growth rate at a given mass decreases with time ( cf . left and right panel of figs .",
    "[ ssfr ] and [ ssfr2 ] ) and it is lower for higher mass galaxies ( ssfr and mass are anticorrelated ) .",
    "however , a fraction of the star - forming cluster galaxies are building - up their stellar mass at a lower rate than field galaxies : 10% and 30% of 24@xmath33+bel and all galaxies , respectively , lie below the field 25 percentile .",
    "moreover , the cluster trends are steeper than the field trends ( best - fit slopes differ by @xmath53 ) , again suggesting that sf in more massive galaxies differs more strongly with environment than sf in lower mass galaxies .      with the aim of investigating whether cluster and group galaxies , separately , differ from the field , we divide the sample into clusters with @xmath14 and groups with @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ cgf ] ) .",
    "we only consider the highest - z bin , as the lowest - z bin has too few group galaxies to study any trend .",
    "figure [ cgf ] shows that the sf in the cluster environment deviates from the field trend , while group galaxies seem to follow the sfr - mass relation of the field .",
    "the k - s test perfromed on mass - matched samples yields a 98% ( without red galaxies ) and a 99.9% ( with red galaxies ) probability that clusters have a different sfr distribution from _ both _ groups and field . in contrast",
    ", the test can not reject the hypothesis that the groups and field have a similar distribution .",
    "our group data are not sufficient to draw firm conclusions , but , if confirmed , our finding suggests that the group environment is not influential for the link between sf activity and mass , therefore strangulation could not be relevant , at least in groups , and only cluster - specific processes could be important .",
    "having removed the groups , the mean sfr in clusters at @xmath3 is 1.93@xmath510.02 ( without red ) to 2.13@xmath510.02 ( with red ) times lower than in the field .",
    "this is the first attempt to establish whether the relation between sf activity and galaxy mass depends on environment .",
    "we find that this relation in clusters is significantly different from the field , at all redshifts when rel galaxies are included , and at least at @xmath3 for 24@xmath33+bel galaxies .",
    "discriminating star - forming from agn red galaxies will allow us to quantify with higher precision the environmental effects .",
    "the observed differences between the sfrs in clusters and in the field can be considered a lower limit to the real gap .",
    "in fact , we are surely considering as cluster members also star - forming galaxies that are either in projection or just recently accreted by the cluster and have not been affected yet by its influence .",
    "this result can not arise from having severely underestimated the dust correction to the @xmath28}$ ] .",
    "if we were to adjust the [ oii ] extinction to bring the field and clusters into agreement , many of the [ oii ] detected sources should be detected at 24@xmath33 , and they are not .",
    "environmental differences are detectable thanks to the low completeness limit in sfr reached . with a higher limit",
    ", the cluster and field relations would appear compatible .",
    "hence , any comparison of sfr and masses in different environments is meaningful only when all data probe down to low sfr levels .",
    "we conclude that there are significant differences between the sf activity of star - forming galaxies of the same mass in different environments .",
    "clusters , in general , show a lower sf activity than the field , not only because they have a pre - existing large population of early - type galaxies passively evolving since high - z , but because currently star - forming galaxies host an average lower sfr than their field counterparts of similar mass .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation is that there are environmental effects suppressing sf in clusters .",
    "fast - acting mechanisms would leave the sfr - mass relation unchanged , while processes with a longer timescale would affect it .",
    "the most popular long - timescale candidate is strangulation , that , if equally effective in groups and clusters , would be ruled out if the similarity we observe between groups and field will be confirmed by larger studies .",
    "even ram pressure stripping , which acts on a short timescale @xcite , may leave residual gas and low sfrs .    as an alternative to environmental mechanisms",
    ", it is possible that other galaxy intrinsic properties besides mass ( e.g. , the morphological distribution ) influence the sf history and vary systematically with environment .    in clusters , we are observing a population of galaxies in transition from being blue star - forming to red passively evolving , while such a population is much less noticeable in the field and perhaps also in groups .",
