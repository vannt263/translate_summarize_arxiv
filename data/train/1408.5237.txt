    "to understand the matter distribution in universe on large scales is one of the major goals of modern cosmology .",
    "the large scale structure is determined by self gravity of galaxies and clusters .",
    "it brings interest to the study of self - gravitating systems .",
    "since the number of galaxies as the typical objects is enormous , one needs statistics to study the distribution . in this regard ,",
    "the @xmath8-point correlation function @xmath5 of galaxies and @xmath4 of clusters serve as a powerful statistical tool @xcite .",
    "it not only provides the statistical information , but also contains the underlying dynamics mainly due to gravitational force .",
    "therefore , we would like to investigate the correlation functions of self gravitating system in thermal equilibrium for the first step although the real universe is not in thermal equilibrium .    over the years , various observational surveys have been carried out for galaxies and for clusters , such as the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) galaxy survey @xcite , the two - degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs)@xcite , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite , etc .",
    "all these surveys suggest that the correlation of galaxies has a power law form @xmath9 with @xmath10mpc and @xmath11 in a range @xmath12mpc @xcite .",
    "the correlation of clusters is found to be of a similar form : @xmath13 in a range @xmath14mpc , with an amplified magnitude @xcite . for quasars @xmath15@xcite .",
    "in the past , numerical computations and simulations have been extensively employed to study the clustering of galaxies and of clusters , and significant progresses have been made . to understand the physical mechanism behind the clustering , analytical studies are important . in particular , reference",
    "@xcite used macroscopic thermodynamic variables , such as internal energy , entropy , pressure , etc , for adequate descriptions , whereby the power - law form of @xmath5 was introduced as modifications to the energy and pressure . similarly ,",
    "reference @xcite used the grand partition function of the self - gravitating gas to study a possible fractal structure of the correlation function of galaxies .",
    "however the field equation of @xmath16 was not given in these studies .    also adopting statistical mechanics",
    ", we employ the techniques of the generating functional @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this practice has been well known in particle physics and condensed matter physics .",
    "the key point is that we express @xmath17 $ ] as a path integral over the mass density field @xmath18 , instead of the gravitational potential .",
    "the functional derivatives of @xmath19 $ ] give the connected green functions @xmath20",
    ", i.e. , the correlation functions of the density fluctuation @xmath21 about the mean density @xmath22 @xcite . in order to set up the field equation of the @xmath8-pt correlation function @xmath23",
    ", we first derive the field equation of the mass density field @xmath18 , which is equivalent to the well - known lane - emden equation for the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the use of the density field @xmath18 suits our purpose .",
    "this has been achieved by modeling the system either as a gas in thermal equilibrium , or as a fluid at rest in the gravitational field in hydrostatical equilibrium .",
    "the equation of @xmath18 is highly nonlinear . to deal with this issue",
    ", we apply the perturbation method , let @xmath24 , and expand the equation in terms of small quantity @xmath21 .",
    "we keep only up to @xmath25 and drop off higher order terms . by taking the ensemble average of the field equation of @xmath26 , and taking functional derivative @xmath27 of the averaged equation , the _ field equation _ of @xmath23",
    "is derived .",
    "the advantage of this formulation is that the field equation of @xmath28 for any @xmath29 can be also derived systematically .",
    "as is anticipated , the 3-point correlation function @xmath30 also appear in the field equation of @xmath31 to this order of perturbations . to cut off the hierarchy ,",
    "@xmath30 can be expressed as the products of @xmath31 by the kirkwood - groth - peebles ansatz @xcite . in the procedure",
    ", the quantities like @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 also show up , as always happens for any interacting field theory when going to high orders of perturbations .",
    "after necessary renormalization to absorb these quantities , we end up with the nonlinear field equation of @xmath23 , also denoted as @xmath0 , with three parameters , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , as the coefficients of nonlinear terms beyond the gaussian approximation .",
    "the formulation applies to the system of galaxies and to the system of clusters as well , whereby the particle mass @xmath2 and the jeans wavelength @xmath38 can vary in the field equation . with a set of fixed values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ,",
    "the solution @xmath0 will confront simultaneously the observational data of galaxies and of clusters . for galaxies , this will also be done for the power spectrum , the projected , and angular correlation functions .",
    "this work surpasses the previous sketched work @xcite by presenting the detailed derivation of the field equation , the renormalization , and modifications of new nonlinear terms . besides , this work also presents the projected , and angular correlation functions , and their direct comparisons with the observations .    in section 2",
    ", we shall derive the field equation of @xmath26 by hydrostatics , and write down the generating functional @xmath17 $ ] .    in section 3",
    ", we shall derive the nonlinear field equation of @xmath0 .    in section 4 , by inspecting the resulting equation of @xmath0",

    ", we shall present the solution @xmath0 for a fixed set of parameters @xmath39 , and confront with the observed correlation function for galaxies .",
    "similar comparisons will be carried out to the power spectrum , the projected , and angular correlation functions , correspondingly .",
    "in section 6 we shall apply the same solution @xmath0 with a greater mass @xmath2 to the system of clusters , and compare with the observational data of clusters . the observed scaling of the  correlation length \"",
    "@xmath40 will be explained and the observed @xmath7mpc periodic oscillations will be interpreted .",
    "section 7 contains conclusions , discusses .    in appendix",
    "a , we give the formulation of the grand partition function of the self - gravitating system in terms of path integral over the gravitational field .    in appendix b , by the technique of functional differentiation , we present the comprehensive details of the derivation of the field equation of @xmath23 and its renormalization involved .",
    "we use a unit with the speed of light @xmath41 and the boltzmann constant @xmath42 .",
    "galaxies , or clusters , distributed in universe can be approximately described as a fluid at rest in the gravitational field due to the fluid , i.e , by hydrostatics .",
    "this modeling is an approximation since the cosmic expansion is not considered . as has been discussed by saslaw @xcite ,",
    "the system of galaxies in the expanding universe is in an asymptotically relaxed state , i.e , a quasi thermal equilibrium , since the cosmic time scale @xmath43 is longer than the local crossing time scale .",
    "therefore , the hydrostatic approximation is appropriate for a preliminary study of this paper .    in general ,",
    "a fluid is described by the continuity equation , the euler equation , and the poisson equation : + ( ) = 0 , + ( * v*)*v * = -p + , [ poisson ] ^2 = -4 g . for the hydrostatical case , @xmath44 and @xmath45",

    "taking gradient on both sides of this equation leads to ^2= ( + ^2 ) .",
    "substituting eq.([poisson ] ) and ( [ eulereq2 ] ) into the above gives [ rederivation ] ^2-()^2+^2=0 .",
    "we call eq.([rederivation ] ) the field equation of mass density for the self - gravitating many - body system . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce a dimensionless density field @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mean mass density of the system . then eq.([rederivation ] ) takes the form [ masseq ] ^2-()^2+k_j^2 ^ 2=0 , with @xmath50 being the jeans wavenumber . this is highly nonlinear in @xmath18 as it contains @xmath51 .",
    "eq.([masseq ] ) also follows from @xmath52 with the effective hamiltonian density [ hpsi ] ( ) = ( ) ^2-k_j^2 . to employ schwinger s technique of functional derivatives @xcite",
    ", we introduce an external source @xmath53 coupled to the field @xmath18 : [ eff_l ] ( , j)=()^2 -k_j^2-j , and the mass density field equation in the presence of @xmath54 is [ field_eq ] ^2-()^2+k_j^2 ^ 2+j^2=0 .",
    "this is the key equation we shall use in section 3 to derive the field equation of correlation @xmath23 .",
    "the generating functional for the correlation functions of @xmath18 is defined as [ zj ] z[j ] = d e^-d^3*r*(,j ) , where @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the sound speed and @xmath2 being the mass of a single particle . here",
    "@xmath57 is introduced for proper dimension .",
    "the surveys of galaxies or clusters reveal the mass distribution , instead of the gravitational field .",
    "( we do not address a possible bias of mass distribution in this paper . )",
    "the advantage of working with the mass density field @xmath18 is to confront the observational data directly @xcite .",
    "eq.([masseq ] ) can also be derived from another approach .",
    "the universe filled with galaxies and clusters can be modeled as a self gravitating gas assumed to be in thermal quasi - equilibrium @xcite .",
    "note that the universe is expanding with a time scale @xmath58 , and the time scale of propagation of fluctuations @xmath59 , both being of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the thermal equilibrium is an approximation .",
    "for such a system of @xmath60 particles of mass @xmath2 , the hamiltonian is [ hamiltonian ] h=_i=1^n -_i < j^n with @xmath61 , and the grand partition function is [ z1 ] z=_n=0^ _",
    "i=1^n e^-h / t , where @xmath62 is the fugacity . using the stratonovich - hubbard transformation @xcite",
    ", @xmath63 can be converted into a path integral over a field @xmath64 @xcite as follows ( the detailed derivation is given in appendix a ) : [ z2 ] z = de^-d^3 r ( ) , where the effective hamiltonian density for @xmath64 is [ l ] ( ) = ( ) ^2-k_j^2e^. by @xmath65 , eq.([l ] ) yields the well - known lane - emden equation @xcite [ lane - emden ] ^2 + k^2_j e^=0 , which , by rescaling @xmath66 , becomes the poisson equation [ poissoneq ] ^2= - 4 g",

    "thus , for the self - gravitating system , the assumption of either thermal equilibrium , or hydrostatical equilibrium , lead to the field equation ( [ masseq ] ) of mass density , which is equivalent to the lane - emden equation ( [ lane - emden ] ) .",

    "the special case of @xmath96 is the gaussian approximation , and eq.([eqfinal ] ) reduces to the helmholtz equation ( [ helmoltz ] ) .",

    "@xmath99 are fixed for demonstration . ]    the solution @xmath0 will confront the observational data of galaxies and clusters in the following .",
    "before studying its solution , we inspect the field equation ( [ eqfinal ] ) to see its predictions about the general properties of the correlation function @xmath0 .    1",
    ", the equation contains the point mass @xmath2 and the characteristic wavenumber @xmath100 .",
    "it applies to the system of galaxies , as well as to the system of clusters , with different respective @xmath2 and @xmath99 in each case .",
    "thus , as solutions of eq.([eqfinal ] ) , @xmath101 for galaxies should have a profile similar to @xmath102 for clusters , but will differ in amplitude and in scale determined by different @xmath2 and @xmath99 . indeed , the observations tell that both @xmath101 and @xmath102 have a power - law form : @xmath103 in their respective , finite range , but @xmath102 has a higher amplitude@xcite .    2 , the @xmath104 source in eq.([eqfinal ] ) has the coefficient @xmath105 , which determines the overall amplitude of a solution @xmath16 .",
    "the mass @xmath2 of a cluster can be @xmath106 times that of a galaxy@xcite .",
    "as for the sound speed , @xmath47 can be regarded as the the peculiar velocity , which is the same order of magnitude for galaxies and clusters , around several hundreds km / s @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 is essentially determined by @xmath2 , and a greater @xmath2 will yield a higher amplitude of @xmath16 .",
    "this property is clearer in the gaussian approximation , where [ xim ] ( r ) m as revealed by the analytical solution @xmath0 seen in eq.([ggaussian ] ) .",
    "this general prediction naturally explains a whole chain of prominent facts of observations : luminous galaxies are more massive and have a higher correlation amplitude than ordinary galaxies @xcite , clusters are much more massive and have a much higher correlation than galaxies , and rich clusters have a higher correlation than poor clusters since the richness @xmath108 the mass @xcite . this phenomenon has been a puzzle for long @xcite and was interpreted as being caused by the statistics of rare peak events @xcite .    3 ,",
    "the power spectrum , as the fourier transform of @xmath0 , is proportional to the inverse of the spatial number density : [ pkn ] p(k ) 1/n_0 .",
    "see in the analytical @xmath109 in eq.([pkgaussian ] ) in the gaussian approximation .",
    "in fact , given the mean mass density @xmath110 , a greater @xmath2 implies a lower @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the properties ( [ pkn ] ) and ( [ xim ] ) reflect the same physical law of clustering from different perspectives .",
    "the property ( [ pkn ] ) also agrees with the observational fact from a variety of surveys . the observed @xmath109 of clusters is much higher than that of galaxies , and the observed @xmath109 of rich clusters is higher than poor clusters , etc .",
    "this is explained by eq.([pkn ] ) , since @xmath111 of clusters is much lower than that of galaxies , and @xmath111 of rich clusters is lower than that of poor clusters @xcite .    4",
    ", the characteristic length @xmath112 appears in eq.([eqfinal ] ) as the only scale , which underlies the scale - related features of the solution @xmath0 . at a fixed @xmath113 , the solution @xmath0 with a high amplitude drops to its first zero at a larger distance , leading to an apparently longer",
    " correlation length \" .",
    "if surveys could cover the whole universe and if all the cosmic mass were in galaxies , which , in turn , were all contained in clusters , then @xmath114 would be the same for the system of galaxies and for the system of clusters . nevertheless , actual cluster surveys extend over larger spatial volumes , including those very dilute regions . therefore , @xmath115 of the region covered by cluster surveys can be lower than @xmath116 for galaxy surveys , and @xmath117 for cluster surveys will be longer than that for galaxy surveys , whereas @xmath47 is roughly the same order of magnitude for galaxies and clusters .",
    "for instance , for rich clusters , the spatial number density @xmath118 clusters mpc@xmath119 compared with @xmath120 galaxies mpc@xmath119 for bright galaxies , lower by three orders @xcite .",
    "but a rich cluster contains only @xmath121 galaxies , the observed mass - to - light ratio of clusters flattens at @xmath122 of the solar ratio @xmath123 @xcite , implying that clusters do not contain a substantial amount of additional dark matter , other than that associated with the galaxy halos and the hot intercluster medium @xcite .",
    "these imply that @xmath115 is lower than @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , as will be seen in the next section 5 and 6 , to use one solution @xmath0 to match the data of both galaxies and clusters , one has to take @xmath99 to be smaller for clusters , than for galaxies , so the system of clusters covered by the surveys has a longer @xmath113 than the system of galaxies @xcite .",
    "now we give the solution @xmath5 for a fixed set of parameters @xmath39 , and confront with the observed correlation from major galaxy surveys .",
