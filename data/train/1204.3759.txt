    "distinct deviations from the predictions of landau - fermi - liquid theory were observed , indicating the presence of a nearby fm quantum critical point . among @xmath4-based systems",
    "this is the clearest experimental example of fm quantum criticality @xcite , although further investigations are necessary to understand this material in more detail .",
    "a further intriguing property of ybni@xmath0p@xmath1 is the quasi - one - dimensionality , with yb and ni - tetrahedra chains along the @xmath3 direction of the tetragonal crystal structure @xcite .",

    "the quasi - one - dimensional anisotropy was theoretically confirmed by uncorrelated band - structure calculations , which reveal that the three main fermi surfaces all have a predominantly one - dimensional character @xcite .",
    "so far , the anisotropy of the physical properties of ybni@xmath0p@xmath1 have not been investigated , as the previous studies were performed on polycrystalline samples @xcite . in this contribution",

    "the crystals grow without preferred growth direction and were oriented and subsequently cut using back - scattering laue and a conventional diamond saw , respectively .",

    "in addition , energy dispersive x - ray spectra performed on a scanning electron microscope ( philips xl30 ) proved the formation of single phase ybni@xmath0p@xmath1 .",
    "however , the exact stoichiometry could not be refined with the latter method , as the l - line of yb and the k - line of ni nearly completely overlap in the energy resolved spectra . the dc - susceptibility and magnetization data",

    "range the electrical transport is dominated by phonons , reflected in a linear - in-@xmath13 dependence for both directions . at @xmath14k , the anisotropy @xmath15 amounts already to a factor of 5 .",

    "the resistivity along the yb chains ( @xmath17 ) is distinctevely smaller than along @xmath20 in the whole invetigated temperature range .",

    "the effective moments for magnetic field along @xmath3 , @xmath22 , and perpendicular to @xmath3 , @xmath23 , match that of the free yb@xmath24 moment ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the anisotropy at high temperatures is reflected in different weiss temperatures , @xmath26k and @xmath27k , for the applied field parallel to @xmath3 and perpendicular to @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "below @xmath16k , the anisotropy of @xmath21 gets more pronounced with a much stronger increase for @xmath28 towards lower @xmath13 and a tendency to saturation for @xmath29 .",
    "the absolute values at @xmath30k and @xmath31 t are a factor of 5 larger for @xmath28 than for @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath32t@xmath33 . from the polycrystalline data it is known ,",
    "that @xmath21 further increases towards lower temperatures and nearly diverges at @xmath34 @xcite . presently , we can not state anything about the anisotropy of the inter - ionic magnetic exchange interaction , which most likely will dominate the susceptibility data in small fields towards @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the anisotropy of @xmath21 needs to be studied on these single crystals down to the mk range in the future .",
    "the magnetization , @xmath35 , as function of applied magnetic field at 1.8k is presented for both directions in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b . for @xmath28",
    ", we observe a strongly curved @xmath35 , in agreement with the strong field dependence of the susceptibility measured on the same sample . at 7 t",
    ", @xmath35 still increases towards higher fields and the polarized moment amounts to @xmath36 . for @xmath29 ,",

    "these observations of the magnetic properties above 1.8k can be well understood in terms of the cef , which leads to a pronounced single - ion anisotropy with ising - type behaviour , i.e. , the magnetic easy direction is the @xmath3 axis of the tetragonal unit cell . on the basis of the present results , a complete determination of the cef parameters can not be given , which would need further experimental input .",
    "however , some constraints of the cef scheme can be already drawn from the existing data .",
    "specific heat measurements on the polycrystal down to 40mk revealed the entropy in zero magnetic field @xcite , from which we can conclude that the cef ground state of ybni@xmath0p@xmath1 is a doublet , as the entropy at 4k amounts to @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , we can estimate by means of the minimum in the thermopower at 35k , the maximum at 20k in @xmath10 along the @xmath20 direction and the pronounced deviation from the curie - weiss behaviour in the susceptibility below 50k , that the first excited cef doublet lies roughly between 10 to 30k above the cef ground state .",
    "finally , the fact that we recover the full effective moment in the curie - weiss law between 200 and 400k gives some evidence that the complete splitting of the 4 kramers doublets of the yb@xmath24 is not much larger than 400k .",
    "however , inelastic neutron measurements are underway to determine the cef scheme more accurately .",
    "in summary , we succeeded in growing single crystals of ybni@xmath0p@xmath1 large enough to determine the anisotropy by means of magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements .",
    "we showed that the anisotropy above 1.8k is dominated by crystalline electric field effects with an ising - type single - ion ground state .",
    "this is reflected in a much higher polarized moment at 1.8k for magnetic field along the @xmath3 direction compared to the in - plane moment .",
    "the resistivity presents large anisotropy in the whole investigated temperature range and reveals more efficient transport along the crystallographic @xmath3 direction , the direction of the quasi - one - dimensional yb chains .",
    "further investigations to lower temperatures on these single crystals are needed to reveal the anisotropy of the magnetic exchange and the direction of the moment within the ferromagnetic ordered state .",
