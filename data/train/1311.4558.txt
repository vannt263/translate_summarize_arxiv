    "<S> release the clamps , and allow for oscillation due to all sources of noise for a time @xmath100 . then use measurement and feedback on a time scale @xmath101 to simultaneously return the oscillators to the clamped state and to estimate the overall amplitude of oscillations induced by the noise during that time . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback cooling of the system provides statistically independent samples over time scales on the order of @xmath102 , as opposed to waiting for the system to reach its steady state at a rate @xmath103 .    for a single shot integration time </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 , the scale of noise in @xmath104 due to thermal fluctuations is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the steady state occupation of phonons at high temperatures . comparing this with the excess noise signal @xmath107 ( from equation ) , we have a signal - to - noise after @xmath108 shots of we see that the total integration time @xmath109 for a @xmath110 result scales as t_int 50 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 for a platinum dumbbell ( @xmath111 g@xmath112 ) , a frequency @xmath113 oscillator common in small - scale tests of newton s laws , a mechanical @xmath114 , and assumed temperature @xmath115 mk in a dilution fridge , this produces a coupling @xmath116 mhz and a @xmath117 integration time on the order of a few thousand years . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , each ` shot ' of the experiment would only be a few thousand seconds , which would enable measurement of many parallel devices to achieve the desired precision goal in substantially shorter real world time . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ability to mass fabricate high quality oscillators using modern techniques from chip - scale opto - mechanics suggest a potential path to a low cost system with thousands of devices .    </S>",
    "<S> we recognize the difficulty of the proposed experiment  </S>",
    "<S> these rates correspond to observation of one excess phonon per few hours against a large thermal background  as well as concede that this tabletop test is far from loop - hole free . </S>",
    "<S> crucial challenges to be addressed in any serious attempt to bound this noise inequality will have to work against both systematic effects , such as temperature variations in the laboratory setting and screening of electromagnetic coupling between torsional oscillators , but also against unresolved challenges regarding quantization of collective degrees of freedom associated with macroscopic masses . however , ultra - high q , low frequency torsional oscillators approaching the necessary requirements and thermally - limited performance have been demonstrated in the laboratory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such an observation showing the lack of excess noise would both validate the perturbative model of gravitons and its noise properties  @xcite , provide stringent constraint on semiclassical gravity theories and information non - conserving theories , and provide insight into the fundamental question of whether gravity can convey quantum information .    </S>",
