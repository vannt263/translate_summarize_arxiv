    "general relativity predicts that light rays passing close to a black hole suffer gravitational lensing , so that an observer almost aligned with the line connecting a source and a black hole sees two images of the original source .",
    "these images are due to small deviations of photons that pass far enough from the black hole to allow a weak field approximation of the metric tensor .",
    "however , already darwin in 1959 noticed that photons passing very close to a black hole may suffer much larger deflections without falling into the event horizon @xcite . in principle ,",
    "an observer situated on the line connecting the source and the black hole , besides the two classical weak field images , would detect two infinite series of images very close the black hole .",
    "these images are produced by photons making one or more complete loops around the black hole before re - emerging in the observer direction .",
    "of course , these relativistic images are largely demagnified w.r.t the original source and for some time they just remained a mathematical curiosity of general relativity .",
    "nevertheless , things changed after the great progress of interferometric techniques and the widely - accepted opinion that the radio - source sgr a * in the galactic center actually hosts a supermassive black hole of @xmath0 solar masses @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "these facts motivated virbhadra & ellis to propose that this black hole may be an ideal candidate for the generation of relativistic images of sources eventually passing behind it @xcite .",
    "in fact , the angular radius of the shadow of sgr a * is predicted to be 23 @xmath1as , which is comparable to the best resolution achieved in the millimeter band ( 18 @xmath1as @xcite ) .",
    "a complete imaging in the sub - mm band was suggested in ref .",
    "future space missions in the infrared and in the x - rays may reach even higher resolutions ( for a complete discussion , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    a new field of gravitational lensing was definitively opened and several authors proposed alternative methods to overcome the evident difficulties of full general relativity calculations of geodesics which typically result in cumbersome equations and heavy numerical integrations @xcite .",
    "however , darwin himself proposed a surprisingly easy formula for the positions of the relativistic images generated by a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "this formula and its consequences were later discussed or re - discovered several times @xcite before virbhadra & ellis proposal .",
    "after that work , it was revived in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was called the strong field limit of the deflection angle .",
    "it was then extended to reissner - nordstrom black holes in ref .",
    "@xcite and applied to microlensing by sgr a * by petters @xcite . in this paper , as suggested by perlick @xcite , we shall revise this terminology , referring to a strong deflection limit ( sdl ) , since an infinite deflection angle is not necessarily related to a large curvature .",
    "this can be realized by considering a very large black hole .",
    "the minimum distance reachable by a photon without being captured is of the same order of the horizon radius .",
    "the riemann invariant @xmath2 , evaluated in the inner region probed by the photon , scales as the curvature at the horizon , i.e. @xmath3 . increasing the mass of the black hole , the curvature felt by the photon becomes arbitrarily low , even if its deflection may be large .",
    "so , it is more correct to speak of a strong deflection limit without referring to the curvature .    the power of the sdl expansion of the deflection angle became evident when its universality was demonstrated in ref .",
    "any class of spherically symmetric black holes leads to the same sdl expansion ; the coefficients of this expansion depend on the specific class of the black hole , representing a sort of identity card , from which all the parameters of the black hole can be extracted . by observing the relativistic images of a gravitational lensing event induced by a black hole , it is possible , in principle , to deduce all its parameters and properties .",
    "since this could also provide the key to discriminate between general relativity and some extended theories of gravitation , this method has been applied to several interesting classes of black holes coming from string theory , braneworlds and wormholes @xcite .",
    "some limitations were removed in refs .",
    "@xcite , while time delay analysis was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as regards spinning black holes , the story is more complicated .",
    "almost forty years have passed since carter reduced the geodesics equations in kerr spacetime to first order equations depending on four constants of motion @xcite .",
    "this fundamental achievement allowed a complete study and classification of all possible trajectories of massive particles and photons moving around spinning black holes @xcite . in order to visualize and study these geodesics ,",
    "a very large amount of numerical methods has been developed through years . in the context of gravitational lensing",
    ", these methods have been used to describe the light curve of a star orbiting a black hole @xcite and the apparent shape of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "rauch & blandford have proved the formation of extended 4-cusped caustics numerically @xcite .    extending the sdl methodology to axially symmetric black holes is not immediate and the simplicity of the approach may be easily lost . in ref .",
    "@xcite the sdl formula was recovered for light rays lying close to the equatorial plane of a kerr black hole , but the coefficients of the formula had to be calculated numerically as functions of the black hole spin .",
    "vazquez & esteban solved the lens equation far from the equatorial plane for some particular cases @xcite , but a complete analytical treatment of kerr lensing is still missing .    in this paper we make a considerable step toward this objective , focusing on observers lying on the equatorial plane and solving the general lens equation for small values of the black hole spin .",
    "perturbative methods allow us to use the schwarzschild sdl formula as starting point to describe the deflection of light rays looping around a kerr black hole in a completely analytical way .",
    "our treatment leads to an amazingly simple description of all relativistic caustics and to the immediate inversion of lens mapping for sources near caustics .",
    "the limitation to the equatorial observer is motivated by the fact that the most important candidate black hole , sgr a * , is likely to have a spin axis perpendicular to the galactic plane , where the solar system lies , in a first approximation .",
    "it is natural , then , to take advantage of this configuration and deal with considerably simplified equations .",

    "in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xcite @xmath4 , the kerr metric reads    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the specific angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "all distances are measured in schwarzschild radii ( @xmath7 ) . @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the polar and azimuthal angles respectively , while @xmath10 is the radial coordinate .",
    "the event horizon is a spherical surface of radius @xmath11 . in our notations",
    ", @xmath6 runs from 0 ( schwarzschild black hole ) to @xmath12 ( extremal kerr black hole ) .",
    "carter showed that the kerr geodesics can be resolved in terms of first integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "the final expressions for lightlike geodesics take the following form ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 in these expressions , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two constants of motion that , along with the initial condition @xmath17 , completely identify the geodesic .",

    "( [ geod1 ] ) remind that the integrals must be performed piecewise , between two consecutive values of @xmath10 and @xmath8 that annihilate the denominators @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( inversion points ) .",
    "then the sign of each piece between two inversion points is chosen in such a way that all of them sum up with the same sign , giving a final positive contribution .    in the context of gravitational lensing",
    ", we are interested to those photons that come from an infinite distance , approach the black hole reaching a minimum distance @xmath20 and then escape back to infinity .",
    "this selects trajectories characterized by @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , since the roots of @xmath18 represent inversion points in the radial motion , we have to impose that @xmath18 has one non - degenerate positive root .",
    "this amounts to require that @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the limiting situation , when @xmath20 becomes a degenerate root , is obtained when the equations @xmath24 , @xmath25 are simultaneously fulfilled at some point @xmath26 . solving these equations w.r.t . @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 we get @xmath27}{a^{2}(x_{m}-1/2)^2}. \\label{qm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given a value of @xmath26 , the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 that characterize those trajectories that bring a photon down to the distance @xmath26 in an infinite time .",
    "asymptotically the photon keeps orbiting forever at a fixed distance @xmath26 from the black hole .",
    "however , this orbit is unstable and small perturbations make the photon fall into the black hole or deviate it back to infinity . in schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the radius @xmath26 of the unstable photon orbit is fixed to @xmath30 in schwarzschild units ( the sphere of radius @xmath26 is then called photon sphere ) . in the case of kerr black holes ,",
    "the radius of the orbit depends on the initial orientation of the photon trajectory . in practice",
    ", @xmath26 may vary between two limiting values @xmath31 , @xmath32 , which respectively represent the radius of the orbit described by a photon co - rotating with the black hole and the radius of the orbit of a counter - rotating photon in the equatorial plane .",
    "all intermediate values correspond to photons whose orbits are not equatorial and do not lie on a single plane . in order to find these limiting values",
    ", we have to impose @xmath33 .",
    "so , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are found as the two largest roots of this equation .",
    "this is a third degree equation whose solution can be found exactly .",
    "however , since the successive calculations would soon become too cumbersome , we will already consider their expansions in powers of @xmath6 . to describe second order effects in the lens equation , it is necessary to take terms up to the third order : @xmath34    we see that in the limit @xmath35 , the two limiting values converge to the schwarzschild photon sphere @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath6 is different from zero , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are distinct .",
    "the specific value of @xmath26 in the interval @xmath37 $ ] uniquely fixes the amplitude of the oscillations on the equatorial plane performed by the photon along its orbit .",
    "in consideration of this fact we introduce a more convenient parametrization , replacing @xmath6 by @xmath38 : @xmath39 varying the parameter @xmath40 in the range @xmath41 $ ] we obtain all possible values of @xmath26 in the range @xmath37 $ ] , corresponding to orbits with different amplitude of the oscillations on the equatorial plane ( a different parameterization with similar properties was used in ref .",
    "we shall see that all quantities assume very simple expressions in terms of this parameter @xmath40 .",
    "now , using this parametrization in eqs .",
    "( [ jm])-([qm ] ) , we can expand @xmath28 and @xmath29 to second order in @xmath6 and read them as functions of @xmath40 : @xmath42 notice that the presence of @xmath6 in the denominators of eqs .",
    "( [ jm])-([qm ] ) allows @xmath40 to appear at zero order already .",
    "that is why we needed a third order expansion for @xmath26 .",
    "so , even in the schwarzschild limit , @xmath40 can be used to parametrize the photon sphere in the @xmath43 plane .    in fig .",
    "[ fig jmqm ] we plot the locus of points @xmath44 when we vary @xmath40 in the range @xmath41 $ ] , for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "we recall that purely prograde photons travelling on the equatorial plane are characterized by @xmath45 and positive @xmath15 , while retrograde photons have negative @xmath15 .",
    "photons with @xmath46 and @xmath47 run on polar trajectories .",
    "any geodesics characterized by @xmath15 and @xmath16 outside this locus ( with @xmath48 ) , correspond to acceptable gravitational lensing trajectories .",
    "all photons with @xmath15 and @xmath16 inside this locus are destined to fall inside the black hole .",
    "there is an immediate connection between these constants and the point in the sky where the observer detects the photon . throughout the paper",
    ", we consider a static observer at a radial boyer - lindquist coordinate @xmath49 , lying on the equatorial plane .",
    "this restriction will keep all equations simple enough to be solved , while ensuring an exhaustive description of the expected phenomenology for sgr a*. this definition has no ambiguity from a mathematical point of view , but needs to be linked to the astrophysical notion of distance from the solar system to sgr a*. the current measurements of the distance to the galactic center are typically based on the dynamical investigation of the stars orbiting around sgr a*. the orbital fits are done in the context of newtonian gravity . as a consequence , the current estimate of the distance to the galactic center , which amounts to about 8 kpc @xcite , assumes a flat background geometry .",
    "this flat distance makes sense as long as all scales are much larger than the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole , which is @xmath50 for @xmath51 m@xmath52 @xcite .",
    "now it is evident that in the limit of large distances , one can simply translate any flat distance from the black hole , as calculated by newtonian physics , into boyer - lindquist coordinates in the kerr geometry . in fact , far from the black hole , in the asymptotic region , the boyer - lindquist coordinate coincide with the euclidean spherical coordinates centered on the black hole .",
    "the ambiguity in this identification is of the order of @xmath53 ( @xmath10 being the distance from the black hole ) and becomes relevant only close to the event horizon , where newtonian physics loses any meaning .",
    "so , we can safely assume @xmath54 kpc , when speaking about sgr a * in any calculations .",
    "then , considering only observers in the asymptotic region ( @xmath55 ) , where the geometry is close to be minkowskian , it is possible to define angular coordinates @xmath56 in the observer sky .",

    "we have taken the spin axis of the black hole parallel to the @xmath59 direction and we have considered a photon moving toward the observer . then , it is immediate to pass from @xmath43 to the corresponding coordinates in the observer sky @xmath56 and viceversa , apart from an ambiguity of sign in @xmath59 .",
    "we can use these formulae to translate the locus @xmath44 into a new one @xmath62 in the plane @xmath56 .",
    "this is given by @xmath63 and is called the shadow of the black hole .    fig .",
    "[ fig thm ] shows the shape of the shadow in the observer sky for different values of @xmath6 . from what we have said before ,",
    "all photons deflected by the black hole must reach the observer from directions @xmath56 outside the shadow .",
    "photons reaching the observer from the inside of the shadow can not come from gravitational deflection but must have been generated by sources in front of the black hole .",
    "so , if we had enough resolution to fully image a black hole , we would see a black shadow with the shape described by eqs .",

    "increasing the black hole spin @xmath6 , the shadow is slightly distorted and gets displaced to the right , meaning that prograde photons ( coming from the left side as seen from the observer ) are allowed to get closer to the black hole , while retrograde photons ( coming from the right side ) must keep farther .    here , for later convenience , we are introducing and making use of expressions",

    "relative variations are well under 1% , at @xmath66 we find an error of 2% , while in the extremal case @xmath67 the error only reaches 5% .",

    "as regards the angular resolution in the k - band , the vlt units can be combined to perform interferometry observations with an equivalent baseline of 200 m and a maximal angular resolution of 2.2 mas ( http://www.eso.org/projects/vlti ) . some space missions performing nulling interferometry ( tpf , http://www.terrestrial-planet-finder.com ; darwin , http://ast.star.rl.ac.uk/darwin )",
    "should be launched in the near future .",
    "according to the mission designs , some spacecraft should fly in formation at distances of the order of tens of meters .",
    "a futuristic development of such idea might lead to much higher resolutions .",
    "the baseline needed for 1@xmath1as resolution is of the order of hundreds of kilometers .",
    "high precision formation flying may be achieved by laser ranging and microthrusters in the wake of what is being studied for lisa ( http://lisa.nasa.gov ) , where the distance between the spacecraft is 5 million km .",
    "some of the stars around sgr a * may cross some caustics and generate bright relativistic images .",
    "however , they would be embedded in the flux coming from sgr a * environment . in the quiescent state ,",
    "sgr a * flux in the k - band should have @xmath232 @xcite .",
    "the infrared emission of sgr a * is believed to originate in the inner 10 schwarzschild radii of the black hole @xcite , with the schwarzschild radius being @xmath233 then it is necessary to establish whether relativistic images can overcome the background flux .",
    "as conservation of surface brightness holds in gravitational lensing , the relativistic images must have the same surface brightness of the original source as seen by the observer , @xmath234 where @xmath235 the intrinsic luminosity of the source , @xmath236 kpc is the distance to the source and @xmath237 is the angular area in the sky subtended by the source , which is @xmath238 . for a source of 10 solar radii with @xmath239 ,",
    "the surface brightness of the relativistic images is four order of magnitudes larger than that of sgr a*.    however , relativistic images have a tiny angular area and their contribution to the number of photons collected by a pixel in a ccd detector may be very small . to get an idea of this fact ,",
    "let us consider a ccd detector where every pixel collects energy flux from an angular area of size @xmath240 . if a relativistic image , in the form of a tangential arc of angular thickness @xmath241 , lies on the pixel area , the flux received is @xmath242 .",
    "on the other hand , the noise coming from the environment of sgr a * to the single pixel is @xmath243 .",
    "then , the signal - to - noise ratio for a single pixel is @xmath244 i.e. a pixel with a tangential arc receives only twice more k - band photons than other pixels .",
    "the @xmath245 could be improved by taking a smaller pixel size or stars with lower radii and higher brightness , but we can not go very far . taking into account absorption by the matter surrounding the black hole that would surely take place and fluctuations in the surface brightness of sgr a * , we doubt that relativistic images of stellar sources can be actually detected in the k - band by present or near future technology .      in the x - rays ,",
    "chandra is leading very important observations discovering the physics of high energy electromagnetic sources in the central region of the galaxy @xcite with a resolution of the order of 0.5 arcseconds .",
    "the space mission project maxim ( http://maxim.gsfc.nasa.gov ) will represent a major leap toward high resolution , reaching the striking resolution of 0.1 @xmath1as . with such observational facility ,",
    "a complete and detailed imaging of the black hole will be possible .",
    "it is very interesting to consider that sgr a * luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band is @xmath246 ergs s@xmath247 , which is much lower than expected if the black hole were accreting at the eddington rate , i.e @xmath248 ergs s@xmath247 @xcite .",
    "there are several models for sgr a * accretion .",
    "models based on bondi accretion ( spherically symmetric inflow ) predict the x - ray emission to be created in a region of the order of @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "models based on advection dominated flow @xcite predict the emission to be dominated by cooler gas at larger radii , of the order of @xmath250 .",
    "indeed , many x - ray sources have been detected in the neighbourhood of sgr a * , with a luminosity comparable or even slightly higher than the supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "these sources are probably low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) which seem very numerous in the galactic center .",
    "the situation seems really appealing , since we have a population of bright compact sources , with possibly poor contamination from the intrinsic luminosity of sgr a*. it is believed that the most of the x - ray emission from a lmxb comes from a region of tens of kilometers .",
    "then we can assume @xmath251 , with an x - ray flux of @xmath252 ergs s@xmath247 .",
    "if we consider an emitting region of @xmath249 for sgr a * , there are 14 orders of magnitude between the surface brightness of an lmxb and the surface brightness of the x - ray emission of the supermassive black hole environment .",
    "then , the signal - to - noise ratio for a single pixel imaging a tangential arc , eq .",
    "( [ inf1 ] ) , is @xmath253 i.e. the signal in a pixel touched by a tangential arc is nearly 6 order of magnitudes higher than the noise from sgr a * environment for a detector with the accuracy of @xmath254as .",
    "the contamination from sgr a * environment seems to be completely under control .",
    "relativistic gravitational self - lensing of sgr a * would just produce relativistic einstein rings with the same surface brightness of sgr a*. the only serious danger for photons coming from outside sgr a * and deflected by the central black hole is absorption by the matter surrounding it .",
    "however , even if some absorption certainly occurs , it seems difficult to fill a gap of so many orders of magnitudes between the surface brightness of the relativistic images and that of sgr a * without affecting the luminosity of sgr a * as well .",
    "of course , the idea firstly proposed by rauch & blandford that some x - ray flares may be explained by lensing of nearby sources is fully plausible in this scenario @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have made an analytical treatment of gravitational lensing by kerr black holes in the strong deflection limit . in order to achieve our objective",
    "we have made three approximations .",
    "the first one is the strong deflection limit approximation for all radial integrals .",
    "this is just an expansion of the elliptic integrals that result from integrations over the full radial motion of a photon . restricting to photons suffering a very large deflection , for all the radial integrals",
    "we have only kept the leading term diverging as @xmath255 and the constant term ( @xmath69 being the separation between the image and the shadow border as seen by the observer ) . as shown in several articles",
    ", this limit gives a very good approximation starting from photons deflected by an angle of order @xmath256 @xcite .",
    "the second approximation has been to consider only small values of the black hole spin @xmath6 . this has allowed us to take the schwarzschild gravitational lensing as a starting point for the derivation of the corrections due to the presence of an intrinsic angular momentum of the black hole . as far as we could compare our results with available exact ones ,",
    "we have verified a considerably wide applicability range of our approximation .",
    "for the first relativistic images , we can safely apply our treatment up to @xmath257 ( @xmath67 being the extremal kerr black hole in our units ) .",
    "the third restriction concerns the position of source and observer . besides the limitation to far sources and observers ( @xmath258 ) ,",
    "we have also restricted to equatorial observers .",
    "this considerably simplifies all calculations without affecting the complete investigation of the most significant physical situation , namely the black hole in sgr a*. in fact , it is natural to assume that the equatorial plane of this supermassive black hole coincides with the galactic plane . in any case , a full investigation stepping beyond these restrictions is in progress .",
    "the first achievement of this paper has been the analytical description of the kerr caustics . at the first order in @xmath6",
    "we find that they are just shifted along the equatorial plane still remaining point - like , while at second order they are resolved into typical diamond - shaped figures .",
    "we are thus able to calculate the position and the extension of the caustics for any order of relativistic images ( as long as we remain in the perturbative regime ) . as stated in sect .",
    "iv , the strong deflection limit treatment does not cover the primary caustic ( @xmath126 in our formulae ) , since this caustic is formed in the weak field regime for @xmath259 @xcite . with no regard to the lensing regime , the effect of the angular momentum of the deflector is similar , with caustics getting a diamond - shaped structure and drifting from the optical axis .",
    "whereas magnification effects due to the primary caustic are very large , its size is very small , so that the creation of additional pairs of images ( which is the most evident manifestation of the presence of a non - negligible spin ) is very difficult to achieve .",
    "the significant extension of relativistic caustics strongly enhances the cross - section for additional images and puts them in a much better position for testing the kerr nature of the black hole .",
    "it has to be remarked that our perturbative investigation still leaves open the possibility that metamorphosis may occur at large values of @xmath6 .",
    "though this has been numerically excluded for the primary caustic @xcite , it is possible that higher order caustics develop more complicated structures in a strongly non - pertubative regime .",
    "the second achievement has been the analytical inversion of the lens mapping near the caustics , which has allowed us to draw fascinating pictures of the relativistic images generated by a hypothetical source close to a relativistic caustic .",
    "however , the most important result has been the possibility of doing concrete analytical estimates of the size and luminosity of the relativistic images .",
    "the lmxbs surrounding sgr a * provide an ideal population of sources , which may eventually bump into a relativistic caustic and generate appreciable relativistic images .",
    "this is because they are compact sources with very high surface brightness in the x - rays , compared to that of sgr a*. this seems not to be the case for stellar sources in the infrared k - band , which have a too small surface brightness .",
    "using our formulae for the magnification of relativistic images , we are entitled to claim that future space missions performing x - ray interferometry with resolutions of the order of 1 @xmath1as will see these relativistic images with high probability .",
    "in this appendix we recall the sdl technique used in ref . @xcite to solve radial integrals , applying it to the integrals that appear in the geodesics equations .",
    "we rewrite them here for an easier reading @xmath260    first we change the integration variable from @xmath10 to @xmath261 by the transformation @xmath262 as a consequence , the integration domain @xmath263 $ ] becomes @xmath264 $ ] .",
    "then , each of the integrals @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be written in the form @xmath265 where the two functions @xmath266 can be easily read by eqs .",
