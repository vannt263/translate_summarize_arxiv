    "statistical mechanics of membranes is a rich subject and has been studied since about twenty years . motivations to obtain a full understanding of the behavior of these complex systems are enforced by many experimental realizations . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for many introducing and pedagogical courses on the subject .",
    "membranes are two - dimensional fluctuating systems of monomers . according to their physical properties",
    ", membranes can be `` fluid '' or `` tethered '' .",
    "fluid membranes consist of freely moving monomers , @xmath0 with hamiltonian depending only on the shape of membranes . on the contrary",
    ", monomers in tethered membranes are tied together by a tethering potential and their connectivity is fixed .",
    "in addition , a membrane can be self - avoiding if intersections with itself are forbidden .",
    "otherwise , it is a phantom membrane . in this paper",
    ", we focus our attention on a model of tethered membranes with external curvature energy without self - avoidance .",
    "any realistic model should include self - avoiding interactions .",
    "but phase diagrams of phantom membranes are rich and contribute to understand the behavior of self - avoiding membranes @xcite .",
    "it is now firmly established that phantom membranes undergo crumpling transition between a flat and a crumpled phase .",
    "flat phase possesses long - range orientational order between normals to the surfaces whereas crumpled phase is totally disordered .",
    "however , the nature of the crumpling transition is still puzzling .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) calculations @xcite with a landau continuous model @xcite predict a discontinuous phase transition when the dimension @xmath1 of the embedding space is lower than 219 , including the physical case @xmath2 . on the other hand , numerical simulations of lattice models @xcite ,",
    "large @xmath1 expansion @xcite and calculations based on truncations @xcite of the schwinger - dyson equations are consistent with a continuous phase transition .    in this paper",
    ", we try to shed a light on this contradiction with an extensive monte carlo ( mc ) study on a model of phantom tethered membranes with bending rigidity .",
    "as it turns out , our results show that the crumpling transition within our model is of first order in agreement with the rg prediction .",
    "section ii is devoted to a description of the model .",
    "our method is described in section iii and the results are shown in section iv .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "we consider a 2d lattice of monomers connected in hexagonal structure , and embedded in the physical 3d euclidean space .",
    "the tethering potential between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) monomers is a truncated lennard - jones ( lj ) potential .",
    "the curvature energy is a standard normal - normal interaction between nn triangles .",
    "the distance between nn monomers are not allowed to be larger than an upper bound distance @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise , in absence of @xmath3 , monomers are no longer effectively tethered at high temperature and the system becomes a gaz . in order to keep essential features of the lj potential , @xmath3 must be sufficiently larger than @xmath4 , the nn distance corresponding to the minimum of the potential , so that @xmath3 lies in the flat asymptotic region of the potential .",
    "however , to have an actual tethered membrane , @xmath3 should not be too large as discussed above .",
    "moreover , equilibration times increase as @xmath3 increases , since nn distances are then allowed to grow more and more .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath5    the first sum is performed on pairs of nn monomers @xmath6 only , and the second one is restricted to pairs of nn triangles @xmath7 .",
    "tethering interaction between nn monomers labeled by @xmath8 and @xmath9 depends only on their distance @xmath10 in the 3d embedding space and is described by @xmath11 , @xmath12 \\ \\ \\                   \\mbox{if $ r_{\\mbox{\\tiny \\it ij } } < r_{max}$ }   \\nonumber \\\\           & = & 0 \\mbox{\\phantom{.}\\hskip 3.55 cm if $ r_{\\mbox{\\tiny \\it ij } } \\ge r_{max}$}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the position vectors in the 3d space .",
    "@xmath16 is the equilibrium distance between nn monomers .",
    "the second term in ( [ equ.hami ] ) is the external curvature energy , with @xmath17 the bending rigidity .",
    "the 3d - vector @xmath18 is defined as the normal unit vector of the @xmath19 triangle formed by three nn monomers .",
    "note that @xmath18 is defined for a counterclockwise oriented triangle .",
    "the phase space of the model depends on three parameters .",
    "we fix two of them , namely ( @xmath20 and @xmath17 ) , and look for temperature - dependent properties .",
    "we consider a membrane of linear size @xmath21 .",
    "the total number of monomers is @xmath22 .",
    "we choose @xmath23 and @xmath24 . a more extensive study would require to explore the complete phase space , but these particular values already give interesting results .",
    "the nn distance in the ground state is taken to be the unit of distance , i.e. @xmath25 , and the upper bound @xmath26 .",
    "we use free boundary conditions , at constant pressure in our simulations .",
    "the following algorithm was used .",
    "starting from the ground state where monomers are on the hexagonal lattice sites , we heat the system to a temperature @xmath27 .",
    "we equilibrate the system at variable volume .",
    "the local equilibration is done as follows : we take a monomer and move it to a nearby random position in a cubic box of volume @xmath28 around its position , in the 3d space .",
    "this position is accepted if it lowers the energy .",
    "otherwise it is accepted with a probability according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we repeat this for all monomers : we say we achieve one mc step / monomer .",
    "we choose @xmath29 to have an acceptance of the order of 50 @xmath30 .",
    "we define the following physical quantities - averaged total energy @xmath31 , averaged normal vector @xmath32 , averaged nn distance @xmath33 , radius of gyration @xmath34 - with the following standard definitions @xmath35",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 indicates thermal average and the sum in @xmath33 is performed only on nn links .",
    "all the results described below are obtained after thermalization of the system .",
    "this requires about @xmath40 mc steps / monomer , depending on the temperature .",
    "after thermalization , measures are done on @xmath41-@xmath42 mc steps / monomer , depending also on the temperature .",
    "error bars are calculated using a standard jack - knife algorithm .",
    "at low temperature , equilibrium configurations are configurations of minimum energy .",
    "this means that nn distance must be close to @xmath43 , the minimum of the lj potential , and that nn normals must be parallel to minimize curvature energy .",
    "so , equilibrium states correspond to a flat state , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is an ordered phase .    at high temperature ,",
    "maximal entropy configurations correspond to crumpled states , where the membrane is compact and occupies a very small volume in the embedding space .",
    "it is a completely disordered phase , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    between low and high temperatures ,",
    "a crumpling phase transition is expected . in this work ,",
    "we study the nature of this transition to see whether it is continuous or not .    as a first point , we measured @xmath48 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 _ versus _ temperature for sizes @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "results are shown in figures [ ener],[norm],[dis ] and [ rg ]",
    ".    0.5 truecm    it turned out that equilibration times are very large for this system .",
    "so , as we were interested in critical properties , we concentrated our work on the temperature region around the phase transition , especially for @xmath52 .",
    "figures [ ener],[norm],[dis ] and [ rg ] clearly show a phase transition between a flat and a crumpled phase at @xmath53 : there is a sharp jump of @xmath54 from the low-@xmath27 flat phase to the high-@xmath27 crumpled phase .",
    "note that the slope of @xmath54 increases with size in the transition region .",
    "the order parameter @xmath32 drops from a finite value ( this value would clearly tend to 1 as @xmath27 tends to zero ) to a vanishing value , as expected for an order - disorder transition .    0.5 truecm    0.5 truecm    at the transition , @xmath34 falls from a finite value dependent of the linear size @xmath21 to a small value more or less independent of @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to the scaling @xmath55 , with @xmath56 in the flat phase and @xmath57 ( indeed , a logarithmic dependence ) in the crumpled phase .",
    "it should be noticed that the nn distance remains finite in the crumpled phase , which means that monomers actually still form a tethered membrane even in the high temperature phase as discussed earlier .",
    "0.5 truecm    the second purpose of our work was to determine whether the transition is continuous or not .",
    "a standard method , when using numerical simulations , consists in a finite size scaling analysis of the maximum of the specific heat @xmath58 . for a second - order phase transition",
    ", it is expected to grow as the linear system size .",
    "for a discontinuous transition , there are in principle discontinuities in thermodynamic quantities . however , for small systems , a discontinuous phase transition can appear to be continuous if the correlation length is greater than the linear size of the system . in that case",
    ", @xmath59 is expected to grow as the size of the system.@xcite    we measured @xmath60 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 using the histogram technique.@xcite for these small sizes , energy histograms have a single peak for all temperatures we explored around the transition ( multihistogram method ) .",
    "they are found more or less gaussian .    in figure",
    "[ cvmax ] , we plot @xmath60 _ versus _ @xmath61 in logarithmic scale .",
    "fitting these data , we obtain @xmath62 with @xmath63 . this value is far from the value @xmath64 expected for a continuous transition .",
    "it is closer to 1 , the theoretical value for a first - oder transition as discussed above . at this stage , in view of this , we conjecture that the transition is of first order . as seen below this conjecture",
    "is confirmed by histograms made for a larger size .",
    "0.5 truecm    in order to check further the first - order character of the transition , we increase @xmath21 . for large",
    "@xmath21 , if the transition is of first order , the energy histogram should show a structure of multiple peaks corresponding to the coexistence of ordered and disordered phases at the transition .",
    "the system would go back and forth between these phases resulting in a double - peak energy histogram .",
    "taking @xmath65 , we indeed observed this double - peak histogram in the region @xmath53 , as shown in figure [ histo ] .",
    "this is a very strong signal which confirms the first - order character of the crumpling transition found earlier by finite - size scaling of @xmath59",
    ".    0.5 truecm",
    "we have studied the crumpling phase transition by mc simulation of a model of tethered membranes with lj potential energy and bending rigidity .",
    "we have shown clearly the first - order nature of the phase transition between flat and crumpled phases , in contrast with earlier simulations using gaussian tethering interaction .",
    "note that these early mc results @xcite and also analytical calculations @xcite show a _ continuous _ phase transition for models which do not include anharmonic excitations .",
    "we believe that the anharmonic nature of the lj potential used in our model to some extend contributes to the first - order transition observed here .",
    "we did not vary in this work the value of bending rigidity @xmath17 .",
    "let us mention however that for @xmath66 , there is no flat phase , the membrane is crumpled at all @xmath27",
    ".    it would be interesting to include self - avoidance between non nearest - neighbors in our model .",
    "however , it seems that in that case the precise form of nn potential is irrelevant : for repulsive self - avoidance between non nearest - neighbors the membrane is always flat regardless of the form of the potential between nn , even in the absence of bending rigidity.@xcite this is interpreted as an effective bending rigidity induced by excluded volume effect .",
    "this can be overcome by an attractive interaction between non nearest - neighbors in addition to the repulsive self - avoiding interaction , leading to the folding of the membrane at low @xmath27 and a flat phase at high @xmath27.@xcite including such repulsive and attractive interactions between non nearest - neighbors in our model is a formidable task which is left for future investigations ."
