    "before we can reliably compute how galaxies form stars and evolve as a function of cosmic time , we must understand the physical processes that regulate the balance between neutral and molecular gas in their interstellar media . only if @xmath5 forms , will gravitationally unstable clouds cool and collapse to high enough densities to trigger star formation in the first galaxies .",
    "it is also generally believed that star formation occurs exclusively in molecular clouds in all galaxies at all epochs .",
    "many galaxy formation models adopt the so - called `` kennicutt - schmidt '' law ( hereafter k - s law , schmidt 1959 , kennicutt 1998 ) to prescribe the rate at which a disk galaxy of given cold gas mass and scale radius will form its stars .",
    "this has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the star formation rate surface density , @xmath8 is the total surface density of the cold gas in the disk , and the exponent @xmath9 is often adopted",
    ". some semi - analytic models also account for a critical density below which disks become gravitationally stable and star formation no longer occurs ( e.g kauffmann 1996 , de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath10\\ ] ] where the critical density @xmath11 is evaluated using the disk stability criterion given in toomre ( 1964 ) . in both equations ( [ eq : kslaw ] ) and ( [ eq : kslaw1 ] ) , the star formation rate surface density is proportional to the total surface density of cold gas ( i.e. both hi and h@xmath12 components ) in the galaxy .",
    "this prescription was motivated by the analysis of 97 nearby galaxies by kennicutt ( 1998 ) , which showed that star formation is more tightly correlated with @xmath8 than with @xmath13 .",
    "there have been studies in apparent disagreement with these conclusions ; for example , wong & blitz ( 2002 ) found that the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath13 is stronger than that between @xmath7 and @xmath14 in galaxies with high molecular gas fractions . in recent years",
    ", high quality , spatially - resolved maps of the cold gas have become available for samples of a few dozen nearby galaxies .",
    "examples of such data include hi maps from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) and co maps from the berkeley - illinois - maryland association survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ) and hera co - line extragalactic survey ( heracles ) .",
    "measurements of the rate at which stars are forming at different radii in the galaxy are provided by spitzer and galex observations .",
    "the combination of these different data sets has led to important new constraints on the relationship between star formation and gas in galactic disks .",
    "bigiel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) studied 18 disk galaxies and showed that @xmath2 forms stars at a roughly constant efficiency in spirals at radii where it can be detected .",
    "their results suggest a star formation law of the form @xmath15    motivated by these findings , galaxy formation modelers are now progressing beyond a simple single - component view of the cold phase of the interstellar medium , and are attempting to model the formation of molecular hydrogen in galaxies .",
    "gnedin , tassis & kravtsov ( 2009 ) included a phenomenological model for @xmath5 formation in hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxy formation .",
    "their model includes nonequilibrium formation of @xmath5 on dust and approximate treatment of both its self - shielding , and shielding by dust from the dissociating uv radiation field .",
    "dutton ( 2009 ) and dutton & van den bosch ( 2009 ) utilized the empirically - motivated hypothesis of blitz and rosolowsky ( 2004,2006 ) that hydrostatic pressure alone determines the ratio of atomic to molecular gas averaged over a particular radius in the disk in their analytic models of disk formation in a @xmath16cdm cosmology .",
    "they analyzed the radial distribution of stars and star formation in their disks , but did not focus very much on gas properties in their model .",
    "there have also been some attempts to predict the balance between atomic and molecular gas in galaxies at different redshifts by post - processing the publically available outputs of semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( e.g. obreschkow et al .",
    "this work also used the same blitz and rosolowsky ( 2004 , 2006 ) prescription to predict the fraction of molecular gas in disks .",
    "however , the obreschkow et al .",
    "approach is not self - consistent , because the simulations have been run assuming a `` standard '' kennicutt - schmidt law for star formation and the presence or absence of molecular gas has no influence on the actual evolution of the galaxies in the model .    in this paper",
    ", we develop new semi - analytic models that follow gas cooling , supernova feedback , the assembly of galactic disks , the conversion of atomic gas into molecular gas as a function of radius within the disk , and the conversion of the gas into stars . in the 1990 s ,",

    "in the first decade of the new millennium , considerable effort went into grafting these models on to large n - body simulations of the dark matter component of the universe .",
    "these efforts began with relatively low resolution simulations ( kauffmann et al .",

    "we explore two different `` recipes '' for partitioning the cold gas into atomic and molecular form : a ) a prescription based on the analytic models of @xmath5 formation , dissociation and shielding developed by krumholz , mckee & tumlinson ( 2009 ) , in which the molecular fraction is a local function of the surface density and the metallicity of the cold gas , b ) the same pressure - based formulation explored by obreschkow et al .",

    "we first use our models to calculate the hi , @xmath5 , stellar mass and sfr surface density profiles of disk galaxies that form in dark matter haloes with circular velocities @xmath18 200 km / s ( i.e. galaxies comparable to the milky way ) and we compare our results to the things / heracles observations presented in bigiel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we then turn to the issue of the predicted _ scaling relations _ between atomic gas , molecular gas and stars for an ensemble of disk galaxies forming in dark matter haloes spanning a range of different circular velocities .",

    "likewise , the scaling laws of bulge - dominated galaxies ( the fundamental plane ) provide important constraints on how these systems may have assembled through merging .",
    "in contrast , few well - established scaling laws exist describing how the cold gas is correlated with other global physical properties of galaxies . surveys of atomic and molecular gas in well - defined samples of a few hundred to a thousand galaxies are currently underway , and this paper will explore what can be learned about disk galaxy formation from the results .    our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the simulation used in our study as well as the semi - analytic model used to track the formation of galaxies in the simulation . in section 3 , we describe the new aspects of the models presented in this paper , including our spatially resolved treatment of disk formation in radial bins , the recipes that prescribe how atomic gas is converted into molecular gas , and our new prescriptions for star formation and feedback . in section 4 , we compare the radial profiles in our models to observations from the things / heracles surveys , and present the global gas properties of the galaxies in our model , such as atomic and molecular gas mass functions . in section 5 ,",
    "we introduce a set of scaling relations for the atomic and molecular gas fractions of galaxies and we clarify which aspects of the input physics are responsible for setting the slope and the scatter of these relations .",

    "snapshot 63 corresponds to redshift 0 and the time interval between two snapshots is approximately 200 myr .",
    "in addition to the main millennium simulation , there is a smaller version with the same cosmological parameters and mass resolution , the so - called milli - millennium , which includes n=@xmath30 particles in a comoving box of 62.5@xmath20mpc on a side .",

    "we will briefly review those aspects of the models most relevant to the analysis presented in this paper .    as described above",

    "the reason why the star formation rate is taken to be proportional to @xmath60 when @xmath61 , is to ensure that the star formation rate is a continuous function of the gas mass .",
    "energy from supernova explosions can reheat the cold gas in disks to hot gas , and it can also eject some of the hot gas from the halo .",

    "the main reason for this discrepancy is that a star formation law of the form given in equation ( [ eq : h2sfr ] ) leads to a gas consumption rate that is _ steeper _ than the total gas profile , resulting in rapid depletion of the gas in the inner part of the disk .",
    "recall that the amount of gas in the disk is regulated not only by star formation , but also by supernova feedback processes , which act to heat the cold gas .",

    "since the gas - phase metallicity can be estimated using strong emission lines in optical spectra ( e.g. tremonti et al . 2004 ) , this should be easily testable with future data sets , such as that provided by the co legacy database for gass survey ( see http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/cold@xmath188gass/ ) .",
    "in this paper , we extend existing semi - analytic models to follow atomic and molecular gas in galaxies .",
    "we study how the condensed baryons in present - day disk galaxies are partitioned between stars , hi and h@xmath12 as a function of radius within the disk .",
    "our new model is implemented in the l - galaxies semi - analytic code and is a modification of the models of croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) , in which dark matter halo merger trees derived from the millennium simulation form the `` skeleton '' , on which we graft simplified , but physically motivated , treatment of baryonic processes such as cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , and chemical enrichment of the stars and gas .",
    "we fit these models to the radial surface density profiles of stars , hi and @xmath5 derived from recent surveys of gas in nearby galaxies , making use of data from sings , things , heracles and the bima song surveys .",
    "we have used our models to explore how the relative mass fractions of atomic gas , molecular gas and stars are expected to vary as a function of global galaxy scale parameters , including stellar mass , mean stellar surface density , and mean gas surface density .",
    "we have attempted to elucidate how the trends can be understood in terms of the three variables that determine the partition of baryons in disks : a ) the mass of the dark matter halo , which determines the total mass of baryons that is able to cool and assemble in the disk , b ) the spin parameter of the halo , which sets the contraction factor of the gas , and thereby its surface density and molecular fraction , c ) the amount of gas that has been recently accreted from the external environment .",
    "the main changes we have made to earlier models are the following :    \\(i ) each galactic disk is represented by a series of concentric rings .",
    "we assume that surface density profile of infalling gas in a dark matter halo is exponential , with scale radius @xmath0 that is proportional to the virial radius of the halo times the spin parameter of the halo .",
    "as the universe evolves , the dark matter halo grows in mass through mergers and accretion and the scale radius of the infalling gas increases .",
    "disk galaxies thus form from the inside out in our models .",
    "the ring representation allows us to track the surface density _ profiles _ of the stars and gas as a function of cosmic time .",
    "\\(ii ) we include simple prescriptions for molecular gas formation processes in our models .",
    "we adopt two different `` recipes '' : one based on the analytic calculations by krumholz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , in which @xmath102 is a function of the local surface density and metallicity of the cold gas , and the other motivated by the work of elmegreen ( 1989 & 1993 ) , blitz & rosolowsky ( 2006 ) , and obreschkow et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , in which the @xmath5 fraction is determined by the pressure of the ism .",
    "\\(iii ) motivated by the observational results of leroy et al . ( 2008 ) , we adopt a star formation law in which @xmath189 in the regime where the molecular gas dominates the total gas surface density , and @xmath190 where atomic hydrogen dominates .",
    "our work leads to the following conclusions :    \\(i ) a simple star formation law in which @xmath191 leads to gas consumption time - scales in the inner disk that are too short . in this paper",
    ", we simply patch over this problem by decreasing the efficiency of supernova feedback in the inner disk .",
    "\\(ii ) the _ mean _ stellar , hi and @xmath5 surface density profiles of the disk galaxies in our model are only weakly sensitive to the adopted @xmath5 fraction prescription .",
    "the reason for this is that for typical @xmath17 disk galaxies , the local gas surface density is the main controlling parameter for both recipes . at low gas surface densities ,",
    "the @xmath5 fraction depends sensitively on metallicity for the krumholz et al .",
    "prescription , but considerably less sensitively on stellar surface density @xmath172 for the pressure - based prescription . as a result ,",
    "the correlation between molecular - to - atomic fraction and @xmath192 for local disk galaxies exhibits more scatter if the krumholz et al .",
    "model is correct .",
    "\\(iii ) our results indicate that galaxies that have recently accreted a significant amount of gas from the external environment are characterized by higher - than - average _ total _ cold gas content .",
    "if the galaxy has high gas surface density , then this excess gas is an unambiguous signature of a recent accretion event , because the time - scale over which gas is consumed into stars is short in such systems . on the other hand ,",
    "if the galaxy has low surface density , a higher - than - average total cold gas content could indicate a recent accretion event , but it may also mean that the galaxy has a higher - than - average spin parameter .",
    "higher spin parameters result in disk galaxies with more extended distributions of cold gas , lower - than - average molecular - to - atomic ratios , and low star formation efficiencies . for these ambiguous systems",
    ", one must seek additional evidence that the outer disks were assembled _",
    "recently_.    although these conclusions are somewhat open - ended , they do suggest avenues for further research .",
    "we believe that a more realistic way forward to solving the gas consumption timescale problem would be to model radial inflow of the gas .",
    "attempts have been made to construct phenomenological models that do include radial mixing of the stars and gas in disks as well as the effect of this mixing on the chemical evolution of the stars formed in the solar neighbourhood ( e.g schnrich & binney 2009 ) .",
    "results from hydrodynamical simulations also indicate that the gas tends to flow inwards , while the stars migrate outwards ( e.g rokar et al .",
    "2008 ) . the main way to distinguish between different scenarios may be the predicted metallicity gradients .",
    "we intend to explore these issues in more detail in future work .    in our model results ,",
    "although the surface density profiles from the two @xmath5 fraction prescriptions are very similar , the models indicate that one should , in principle , be able to confirm the metallicity - dependence of the molecular gas fraction predicted by the krumholz prescription , if one measures the average gas - phase metallicities of nearby disk galaxies using emission lines .",
    "alternately , one can break the degeneracy by observing systems where the metallicity is low but the pressure is high ( fumagalli , krumholz & hunt 2010 ) .",
    "another interesting issue is whether a galaxy s location in the gas scaling relation diagrams can serve as a diagnostic as to whether it has accreted gas from the external environment . although the theory of gas accretion in galaxies has received considerable attention of late ( e.g. kere et al . 2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ) , there is little _",
    "observational evidence that this occurs in practice .",
    "this is true both for galaxies in the local universe and at high redshifts , where gas accretion rates are expected to be much higher .",
    "although average gas accretion rates are expected to be low at the present day , precise quantification of the expected scaling relations for equilibrium disk galaxies may allow us to identify a subset of systems which deviate significantly from the mean in terms of their gas content .",
    "following the conclusion ( iii ) , one may try to gain a better understanding of the observationally detectable signatures of a recent gas accretion episode .",
    "possible ways forward would be to look for signatures of recent accretion in the observed age gradients of the stars or in the metallicity gradients of the gas in the disk .",
    "one could also look for accretion signatures in the kinematics of the stars and the gas in the outer disks .",
    "alternatively , one could search for evidence of complex structure ( e.g. tidal streams or shells ) in the stellar haloes of gas - rich galaxies ( cooper at al 2010 ) .",
    "we intend to explore these possibilities in more detail in future work .",
    "ongoing and future surveys , such as the galex arecibo sloan survey ( gass ) ( catinella et al .",
    "2010 ) and the cold gass survey carried out at the iram 30 m telescope ( saintonge et al . in preparation ) will enable us to quantify the scaling relations discussed in this paper in considerable detail .",
    "these surveys will provide interesting targets for follow - up programs , which may help us understand that extent to which galaxies still accrete gas at the present day . in the next few years , it will become possible to observe gas in galaxies at higher redshifts using facilities such as alma and square kilometer array pathfinder experiments such as askap or meerkat .",
    "we are certain that our simplified treatment of disk formation in concentric rings that undergo no radial mixing will not be a good way to describe the assembly of the clumpy , highly turbulent disks that are now known to exist at @xmath193 ( e.g. genzel et al .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our models may still be useful in elucidating the gaseous and chemical evolution of disks over a somewhat smaller range in lookback time .",
