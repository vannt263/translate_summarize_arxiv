    "the diverse morphological and kinematic features of interacting disk galaxies have a simple dynamical explanation : galactic bridges and tails @xcite , rings @xcite and related structures result when ordinary galactic disks experience strong tides in close encounters .",
    "tides also cause interacting galaxies to merge by inexorably transferring energy and momentum from relative motion to internal degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "with such a straightforward physical basis , one might expect that dynamical modeling of interacting galaxies would be relatively easy .",
    "however , it s very time - consuming to explore the large parameter space required to describe a galaxy collision and find a good match to the kinematics and morphology of a specific system .",
    "in addition , it s never been entirely clear that a good match yields a unique or physically meaningful model .    in this paper",
    "we develop and test an efficient methodology to model the observable morphology and kinematics of pairs of interacting disk galaxies .",
    "empirical tests show that the resulting models can be used to make strong inferences about the systems they match . while we do not consider minor mergers and interactions in this paper , our methodology",
    "can easily be extended to treat such encounters .    at first glance",
    ", it seems all too easy to model interacting galaxies  and impossible to do so with any degree of confidence .",
    "the dynamical state of a galactic collision is described by a phase - space _ distribution function _",
    ", @xmath1 , which gives the mass density at position  @xmath2 and velocity  @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , observations of a specific component @xmath4 ( e.g. , neutral hydrogen ) yield a _",
    "data cube _ @xmath5 , which represents the distribution of that component at each point @xmath6 on the plane of the sky as a function of line - of - sight velocity @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath1 depends on _ six _ variables , while @xmath5 depends on only _ three _ , it appears that observations do not provide enough information .",
    "put simply , there are an infinite number of different 6-d distribution functions consistent with any given 3-d data cube .    on further reflection",
    "the problem is not quite as hopeless as it appears . this is because a typical galaxy merger begin with a tidal encounter between two normal , fairly symmetric spirals .",
    "galaxies are scrambled as they merge , but the stars and dark matter which constitute most of their mass evolve collisionlessly .",
    "the fundamental dynamical equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational potential , is fully reversible ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ; thus in some sense the original galaxies are still there , imposing a hidden symmetry on the dynamical state of a merging system .",
    "so we need not consider _ all _ possible distribution functions consistent with a given data cube ; only a very small subset of these functions can possibly result from an encounter between two normal disk galaxies .    in practice ,",
    "mergers are modeled by guessing initial conditions , numerically simulating the ensuing collision , and comparing the result to the morphology and kinematics of the system one wants to model .",
    "if the model fails to match the observations , go back and guess again until the results are satisfactory .",
    "most of the guess - work focuses on selecting the disk orientations , typically specified by angles @xmath10 and @xmath11 for disks 1 and 2 @xcite ; also needed are the eccentricity @xmath12 and pericentric separation @xmath13 of the initial orbit , as well as the galactic mass ratio @xmath14 .",
    "so _ seven _ parameters are needed to specify the initial conditions for an encounter of two axisymmetric disk galaxies  not counting the parameters used to specify their internal structures depending on the energy @xmath15 , angular momentum about the symmetry axis @xmath16 , and a third integral of motion @xmath17 . formally speaking , an _",
    "infinite _ number of parameters are needed to specify such a function . ] .",
    "once a simulation has been run , one must select another _ nine _ parameters when comparing the results to observational data : a time @xmath18 since pericenter , a viewing direction given , for example , by angles @xmath19 , scale factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 for length and velocity , and a center - of - mass position on the plane of the sky @xmath22 and velocity @xmath23 . all told , a minimum of _ sixteen _ parameters are needed to completely specify the initial conditions , time , point of view , and scale of a merger model .",
    "this plethora of parameters has long posed a challenge for systematic surveys of galactic collisions @xcite .",
    "the problem we address here is slightly different  instead of trying to survey the entire parameter space , we want to navigate toward a solution matching the morphology and kinematics of a given interacting system .",
    "intuition and prior experience can guide this process by narrowing the range of parameter space explored .",
    "nonetheless , given the size and complexity of this parameter space , it s not surprising that many simulations must be run to attempt a match , or that detailed models of galactic collisions are not easy to produce .",
    "while self - consistent simulations are useful to finalize dynamical models of tidally interacting galaxies , here we simulate galactic disks with test particles .",
    "test particles have a long history @xcite and nicely reproduce features such as bridges , tails , and shells which develop with little direct influence from self - gravity .",
    "to include orbital decay , which is crucial in modeling the more advanced stages of galaxy encounters and mergers , the test particles may be used to estimate the drag on the central masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , orbit decay is largely driven by tidal interactions of galaxy _ halos _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it s relatively easy to compute the self - consistent interaction of two halos using n - body simulations .",
    "our initial approach was therefore to represent the mass of each galaxy with a spherical distribution of massive particles ; in each of these spheres , we embedded _",
    "multiple _ disks of test particles , and decided which disk to display _",
    "after _ running the simulations .",
    "building on this idea , and taking advantage of the faster processors now available , we have replaced these discrete collections of disks with spherical swarms of test particles moving on circular orbits  in effect , populating each galaxy model with _ all _ possible disks .",
    "the modeling procedure begins by selecting mass models for the two galaxies , thereby fixing the mass ratio @xmath14 .",
    "our models include a bulge , a disk , and a halo ; these components have cumulative mass profiles @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively , where @xmath27 is the total mass in component @xmath4 within radius @xmath28 . for each galaxy ,",
    "we compute the total mass profile @xmath29 calculate the corresponding isotropic distribution function using eddington s ( @xcite ) formula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and construct a spherical n - body realization of this profile using @xmath30 equal - mass particles .",
    "details of this procedure are given in appendix  a.    each of these spherical n - body realizations is then loaded with @xmath31 test particles moving on circular orbits .",
    "we pick the orientation of the orbit of test particle @xmath32 by randomly drawing its normalized angular momentum @xmath33 from a uniform distribution on the unit sphere @xmath34 .",
    "the radial distribution of the test particles may be chosen at will .",
    "the simplest choice is to use a radial distribution following the cumulative profile of the disk , @xmath25 ; with this approach , the test particles representing a disk with a normalized spin vector @xmath35 are those with @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a tolerance parameter proportional to the number of particles selected . in practice , however , this places many disk particles at small radii where they are largely immune to tides . the sampling at large radii can be improved by radially biasing the test particle distribution .",
    "we do this by multiplying the local disk particle density , @xmath38 , by a factor of @xmath39 , and replacing ( [ eq : select_unbiased_disk ] ) with @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the _ initial _ orbital radius of particle @xmath32 , and @xmath42 is a parameter which keeps ( [ eq : select_biased_disk ] ) from diverging for small @xmath41 .",
    "particles selected using ( [ eq : select_biased_disk ] ) follow the original disk distribution down to radius @xmath42 , at smaller radii the disk is undersampled , but this has little effect if @xmath42 is small .    finally , two such configurations are placed on a relative orbit with a given pericentric separation @xmath13 and eccentricity @xmath12 and followed until they merge ; we save particle positions and velocities every few time - steps , creating a data - base of several hundred frames tracing the system s history from start to finish .",
    "this data can then be used to approximate _ any _ encounter with the chosen @xmath14 , @xmath13 , and @xmath12 .",
    "identikit software includes interactive routines allowing the user to select the disk orientations , viewing direction , scale factors , and centroid positions ; the resulting test - particle coordinates are instantly projected on the @xmath6 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 planes .",
    "the user can also step forward or backward in time , switch between data - bases created using different values for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath12 , and vary the tolerance parameter @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , an observational data cube @xmath47 for a specific system to be matched may be projected onto the @xmath6 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 planes , typically using grey - scale or contour images .",
    "a lap - top computer can easily store the necessary data and supply the modest processing power required when searching for a match .",
    "[ idkit_match ] presents an example ; the encounter and viewing parameters have been adjusted so the test particles ( points ) closely match the data cube ( grey - scale ) .",
    "the identikit system is designed with the primary goal of analyzing observations . however , it s not straightforward to perform empirical tests using observational data . for one thing ,",
    "much of the available data is rather heterogeneous ; data - sets with uniformly high resolution and signal - to - noise ratio are not easy to obtain . for another",
    ", we do nt know the true initial conditions and viewing parameters for more than a handful of the mergers that have been observed , so we do nt have any simple way to validate the results of our modeling . to determine if identikit can actually reconstruct galactic encounters from the information contained in data - cubes , we tested it on an artificial data set of @xmath0 self - consistent disk galaxy merger simulations with random orientations , times since first passage , viewing directions , and scale factors .",
    "our disk galaxy model has a spherical bulge @xcite containing @xmath48% of the mass , an exponential / isothermal disk @xcite containing another @xmath49% , and a spherical dark halo @xcite containing the remaining @xmath50% .",
    "the density profiles for these components are @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the scale length of the bulge , @xmath53 is the cylindrical radius , @xmath54 is the scale length of the disk , @xmath55 is the scale height of the disk , and @xmath56 is the scale length of the halo .",
    "each galaxy was realized using a total of @xmath57 particles .",
    "the simulations used natural units with newton s constant @xmath58 . in these units ,",
    "the galaxy model has total mass @xmath59 and half - mass radius @xmath60 .",
    "the disk s scale length @xmath61 , and the median circular velocity of the disk material is @xmath62 ; at a radius of @xmath63 the orbital period is @xmath64 .",
    "we restricted our artificial data set to equal - mass ( @xmath65 ) encounters with parabolic initial orbits ( @xmath66 ) ; for each orbit , the pericentric separation @xmath13 was drawn from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath67 = [ 0.6,6 ] a_{\\rm d}$ ] .",
    "the instant when this idealized two - body orbit reaches pericenter defines @xmath68 ; times @xmath69 are before pericenter , while times @xmath70 are after pericenter .",
    "we adopt a coordinate system in which the orbital angular momentum vector is parallel to the @xmath71 axis .",

    "further details on the galaxy models and the merger simulations are given in appendix  b.    for each of the @xmath0 merger simulations we chose a random time between first and second pericenter , rescaled the system by random factors in length and velocity , and `` observed '' it from a random direction .",
    "we first determined the relative orbit of each pair of galaxies , using the most tightly - bound @xmath77 particles in each bulge to measure galactic positions .",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath79 be times of first and second pericenter , respectively ; the random time @xmath18 was drawn from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath80 $ ] and rounded down to the nearest available output time .",
    "next , we selected scale factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 for length and velocity , respectively .",
    "these were chosen so that the galaxy models obey a mass - radius - velocity relation of the form @xmath81 with a small amount of scatter ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "let @xmath82 be drawn from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath83 $ ] , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 be drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit dispersion ; then @xmath86    finally , we chose a random viewing direction @xmath87 from a uniform distribution on the unit sphere @xmath34 .",
    "we drew a second vector @xmath88 from the same distribution , and set @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these vectors and scale factors were used to map the position @xmath91 and velocity @xmath92 of each particle @xmath32 to data - cube coordinates : @xmath93    particles from the disks of the two galaxies , transformed to @xmath94 coordinates , provide an n - body representation of a data cube @xmath95 for the disk material .",
    "such data is roughly comparable to the neutral hydrogen data - cubes @xmath96 available for many interacting galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the simulated data has better resolution than most observational data - sets and is free of noise and interferometric artifacts ; moreover , our simulations used collisionless particles instead of neutral gas .",
    "we could have run random mergers with gas to improve the correspondence between the simulations and real observational data , but the computing time required for a large suite of simulations with gas is non - trivial .",
    "fortunately , collisionless simulations do a good job of reproducing the tidal features commonly detected in hi since the latter usually evolve ballistically once tidally extracted from their parent galaxies .    to present the simulated data in the form required for identikit matching , we projected the disk particles for each of our @xmath0 mergers on the @xmath6 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 planes ; gridded particle distributions were lightly smoothed to produce grey - scale images .",
    "we also used tightly - bound particles from the bulge of each galaxy to determine its position and line - of - sight velocity ; the results were plotted on top of the grey - scale images .",
    "our images are thus analogous to hi maps supplemented with accurate nuclear coordinates and velocities .",
    "the entire procedure outlined above , including both the generation of the simulations and the selection of viewing parameters , was performed by automated scripts without human intervention ; we did not know the actual values of any parameters except @xmath12 and @xmath14 . the resulting sample of merging galaxies , shown in fig .",
    "[ random_mergers ] , possess a variety of morphologies ; only a subset display the `` double tails '' characteristic of the best - known mergers @xcite .",
    "we prepared a series of eight identikit simulations spanning a range of pericentric separations .",
    "each simulation contained two identical ( @xmath65 ) configurations of @xmath97 test particles and @xmath98 massive particles ; the mass model used to set up the massive particle distribution was a spherical version of the one used in the random mergers .",
    "these configurations were placed on parabolic ( @xmath66 ) relative orbits with pericentric separations @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , starting at @xmath107 time units before first pericenter , and followed until @xmath108 , by which time even the widest passage had merged .",
    "we used these simulations and the identikit software to fit each of the random mergers by interactively matching the `` observed '' @xmath6 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 projections with test particles .",
    "the modeling process usually began with rough guesses for the viewing direction , time since pericenter , and pericentric separation .",
    "a variety of clues guided these guesses .",
    "for example , short but pronounced tidal features point to a recent tidal encounter , while long but attenuated features suggest an older passage ; in later stages , loops associated with tails show that material has started falling back .",
    "likewise , if the galaxies display a large separation in projected velocity then the sight - line must be close to the orbital plane ; conversely , a small difference in projected velocity implies either that the system is observed near apocenter or that the relative velocity vector is roughly perpendicular to the line of sight . finally , other things being equal , closer passages generally yield stronger and more dramatic tidal features .",
    "the next step was to adjust the orientations of the two disks , attempting to roughly match the morphology and kinematics of the system .",
    "this generally suggested further modifications to the viewing direction , separation , and time , as well as the scale factors and center - of - mass position and velocity .",
    "further adjustment of all parameters continued until a satisfactory match was obtained or exhaustion set in .",
    "our criteria for a satisfactory match were somewhat subjective . ] ; we placed a good deal of weight on matching tidal features ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ idkit_match ] ) , while recognizing that test particles ca nt accurately reproduce structures  such as tidally - induced spirals  which depend on self - gravity .",
    "each match typically took a few hours , and the entire set of @xmath0 random mergers was matched in about one month ; for comparison , a match to the ngc  7252 merger remnant @xcite took @xmath109 n - body runs over a three month time period , while a match to the ngc  4676 system @xcite took @xmath110 runs over two months .",
    "after changing the viewing direction , time since pericenter or orbital parameters , it s usually necessary to reposition the centers of the models on top of the actual positions by adjusting the rotation about the viewing axis @xmath111 , scale factor @xmath20 , and center of mass position @xmath112 .",
    "we therefore implemented an option to `` lock '' the centers ; when this option is invoked , @xmath111 , @xmath20 , and @xmath113 are recalculated on the fly , keeping the projected positions of the models invariant as other parameters are changed .",
    "locking works quite well when the two galaxies are well - separated on the @xmath6 plane ; it s less useful , and can be downright counter - productive , when the centers appear close together . in fine - tuning",
    "a nearly final match we sometimes found it useful to unlock the centers , trading off slight misalignments in central positions for improved matches to tidal features .",
    "[ idkit_match ] , which shows our match to object  23 ( see fig .  [ random_mergers ] ) , illustrates many aspects of the matching process . from the start",
    ", it seemed likely that the viewing direction would be fairly close to the orbital plane , since the two galaxies have rather different systemic velocities .",
    "the galaxy on the lower right of the @xmath6 projection appears nearly edge - on , as indicated by its morphology _ and _ its rather large velocity range .",
    "since its tidal features lie more or less in the same plane as the disk itself , it seemed plausible that this galaxy has a relatively small inclination @xmath114 to the orbital plane , while its companion clearly has a higher inclination @xmath115 and appears more face - on from our viewpoint .",
    "the dual - valued velocities along the tail of the edge - on disk , which produce the `` hook''-shaped feature seen in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 projections , suggested that this tail is actually quite extended , but viewed so as to double back on itself .",
    "for an initial match to this system , we tried a `` middle - of - the - road '' pericentric separation ( @xmath116 ) ; at a relatively early time ( @xmath117 ) we could roughly match the velocity difference and some aspects of the morphology and kinematics , including the spiral morphology of the face - on disk and the hooked tail in the @xmath44 projection .",
    "however , other features of this initial match were less satisfactory . in the @xmath43 projection ,",
    "the tail doubled back too soon , while in the @xmath44 projection , the bridge did not span the velocity range between the galaxies , falling to the left of its ideal position .",
    "moreover , the more face - on disk , while nicely rendered in the @xmath6 projection , populated regions of phase space which the @xmath44 projection showed to be empty . trial and error revealed that wider passages and later times could repair most of these defects ; the solution shown in fig .",
    "[ idkit_match ] uses a @xmath118 passage viewed at @xmath119 .",
    "the tail in this match , while more extended than it was initially , is still a bit too short .",
    "times @xmath120 yield longer tails , but the velocity difference between the galaxies becomes too small , and bridge particles falling through the more face - on disk over - populate a relatively sparse region of phase - space .",
    "the adopted solution is therefore a compromise between several competing factors .",
    "after comparing our identikit models to the morphology and kinematics of all @xmath0 random mergers , we subjectively graded the solutions as `` good '' ( @xmath121 cases ) , `` fair '' ( @xmath122 cases ) , or `` poor '' ( @xmath123 cases ) ; these grades are indicated in fig .",
    "[ random_mergers ] .",
    "good matches , like the one in fig .",
    "[ idkit_match ] , strongly constrain the parameters .",
    "fair matches generally appear plausible but allow more latitude in selecting parameter values ; this group included several systems with twin edge - on tidal tails .",
    "poor matches could be divided into two groups : systems with weak and diffuse tidal features , typically resulting from very wide encounters involving retrograde or highly inclined galaxies ( objects  16 and 32 ) , and systems with pronounced but confusing tidal features ( objects  1 , 6 , 11 , and 24 ) .      ]    with the identikit solutions in hand , we compared their parameter values to the true values used to generate the artificial merger data .",
    "[ interparam ] uses an abstract cylindrical coordinate system to portray the parameter space explored in these solutions .",

    "[ residuals ] ]    as shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ residuals ] , errors in disk orientation @xmath145 are correlated with errors in viewing direction @xmath154 .",
    "this correlation , which is largely driven by the poor fits , is not hard to explain .",
    "once a viewing direction has been selected , the next step is usually to adjust the disk orientations ; if clear guidance from tidal features is lacking , the best one can do is to match each disk s position angle and apparent tilt with respect to the line of sight . a poor choice for the viewing direction will induce comparable errors in spin direction , as seen here .",
    "the plot in the upper right panel shows that residuals in the time since pericenter @xmath18 correlate with residuals in pericentric separation @xmath13 .",
    "this correlation also has a simple explanation ; wider passages evolve and merge more slowly , so if @xmath162 is for some reason overestimated during the matching process then a larger @xmath164 can partly compensate for this error . as an extreme example , suppose @xmath162 was set so high that an encounter with the correct @xmath164 would already have merged by this time ; by selecting a larger value for @xmath164 , the merger can be delayed until some time after @xmath162 , improving the match to the morphology .    a clear correlation between the residuals in @xmath18 and @xmath20 of the form @xmath177 is shown in the lower right panel of fig .  [ residuals ] .",
    "such a correlation arises naturally in cases where fits are strongly constrained by well - developed tidal tails . in a proper tail ,",
    "material at the tip is moving fast enough to escape ; at late times this material will have asymptotically constant velocity @xcite , implying that a tail s length grows in proportion to its age @xcite .",
    "if @xmath162 is overestimated , tidal tails will be longer in direct proportion , and a smaller value of @xmath178 will be needed to rescale them to their correct physical lengths .",
    "it s likely that similar considerations also apply when other kinds of tidal features provide the primary constraints ; this is consistent with the results presented here , which show that the good and fair fits fall close to @xmath179 , while the poor ones are more scattered .    finally , we conjecture that the correlation between residuals of @xmath13 and @xmath20 shown in the lower left panel is induced by the @xmath173@xmath180 and @xmath163@xmath168 correlations already described . of the three ,",
    "the @xmath181@xmath168 correlation shows the most scatter , and its outliers tend to match those in the @xmath173@xmath180 correlation .",
    "an interesting consequence of these correlations emerges when the dimensionless model parameters @xmath18 and @xmath13 are combined with the length and velocity scale factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in matching an identikit model to observational data , @xmath182 and @xmath183 might be given in units of @xmath184 , and @xmath7 might be given in units of @xmath185 ; the scale factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 would then have units of @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively , and define a transformation from dimensionless model data to real physical values .",
    "the physical pericentric separation is @xmath186 , while the time since pericenter is @xmath187 .",
    "a glance at the two lower plots in fig .  [ residuals ] suggests that these correlations may actually _ reduce _ errors in estimates of the physical parameters @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "table  [ fit_ratios ] supports this ; the uncertainty in @xmath171 , as indicated by the ratio of @xmath188 to @xmath189 quartile values , is about half the uncertainty in @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath170 the improvement is not as striking ; the ratio of @xmath188 to @xmath189 quartiles is slightly smaller than the ratio for @xmath18 , but it appears that @xmath21 introduces some additional scatter and a small bias .      for balance ,",
    "it s worth taking a closer look at some of the less successful matches .",
    "we judged six out of @xmath0 of our solutions to be poor fits to the `` observed '' data .",
    "as already noted , two of the systems with poor matches had very diffuse tidal features , while four had fairly strong features .",
    "our difficulties in modeling the latter are somewhat surprising ; why , given the information which must be present in strong tidal features , did nt the models turn out better ?    to 0.05to 0.05    fig .",
    "[ poor_match ] presents three versions of one of the more difficult systems ( object  6 in fig .",

    "the left - hand version shows an identikit model with the correct disk orientations , viewing direction , and velocity scale `` dialed in '' by hand .",
    "only a finite set of pericentric separations are available in identikit , so it was not possible to exactly match the pericentric separation @xmath190 ; on the whole , @xmath191 gave a better match than @xmath192 although the latter is numerically closer .",
    "this closer approach favored a somewhat different length scale ( @xmath193 vs.  @xmath194 ) and a slightly earlier time ( @xmath195 vs.  @xmath196 ) ; both of these adjustments are qualitatively consistent with the residual correlations discussed in the last section .",
    "the `` correct '' solution on the left in fig .",
    "[ poor_match ] does a poor job of matching the morphology ( top ) .",
    "it does better at matching the kinematics ( bottom ) , although some fairly large regions of phase space are quite under - populated , and one of the spiral arms in the more face - on disk produces a badly - placed streak of particles across the @xmath43 projection . by our subjective criteria ,",
    "this solution is a poor fit . since the disk orientations and viewing direction _ exactly",
    "_ match those used to generate the grey - scale images , this mismatch must be largely due to the lack of disk self - gravity in the identikit simulations .",
    "in particular , the spiral morphology of the more face - on disk is very poorly reproduced ; with hindsight , we recognize that this spiral probably owes its form to self - gravity .    the middle and right parts of fig .  [ poor_match ] present two of the solutions we found while trying to match this system .",
    "essentially , each matches one galaxy while failing to match the other .",
    "the middle solution does a plausible job of matching the morphology _ and _ kinematics of the more edge - on disk , using a close passage ( @xmath197 ) at an early time ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "although it does a very poor job with the more face - on disk , this solution is actually not too bad  the viewing angle is off by @xmath199 , but the disks are within @xmath200 of their correct orientations .",
    "the right - hand solution approximates the morphology and kinematics of the more face - on disk , using a wider passage ( @xmath191 ) at the same early time .",
    "ironically , although the decent - looking fit to the face - on disk and somewhat plausible match to the edge - on disk led us to adopt this solution as the best of a bad lot , it s actually a _ much _ less accurate fit than the middle one  the viewing angle is off by @xmath201 , while the face - on and edge - on disks are misaligned by @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively ! the splattering of particles between the galaxies in the @xmath43 projection , populating a region which should have been completely empty , was the critical flaw which saved us from assigning a `` fair '' grade to this solution .",
    "the other three systems which we failed to fit despite their strong tidal features are a mixed lot . in object  24 , much as in the example just discussed , the `` correct '' identikit solution does nt match the morphology of either galaxy . in object  11 ,",
    "the correct solution matches one disk but fails to reproduce the morphology and kinematics of its partner .",
    "finally , object  1 is reproduced quite accurately by the correct identikit model .",
    "our failure with object  1 was largely due to insufficient patience , while with object  24 the mismatch was so bad that the correct solution does not stand out when compared to other possible fits .",
    "object  11 is intermediate ; had we stumbled across the correct match to one disk we might have recognized the overall plausibility of this solution . in sum , human limitations and lack of self - gravity contribute about equally to the four poor matches of systems with strong tidal features .",
    "under somewhat idealized conditions , the identikit methodology can recover the key parameters of a galactic encounter from a single data - cube .",
    "if the method can also be applied to real data , it will be a powerful tool for interpreting observations and reconstructing the dynamical histories of interacting galaxies .",
    "but before going further , some limitations should be discussed .      first ,",
    "as noted above , identikit simulations are not completely self - consistent .",
    "halos and bulges are treated self - consistently , but disks  of necessity  must be modeled with test particles .",
    "disk structures requiring self - gravity , including bars and swing - amplified spirals , will not be reproduced .",
    "consequently , these features ca nt be used to match models to observations . moreover , orbital decay of identikit models is independent of disk orientation , whereas direct passages are expected to decay faster than retrograde ones @xcite . for a pair of galaxies approaching their second passage ,",
    "the estimated time @xmath162 since first pericenter may be off by as much as @xmath204% ; in applications requiring an accurate estimate of @xmath162 , identikit models should be followed up with self - consistent simulations .",
    "second , while the test particles we used to model disks are collisionless , most kinematic tracers follow a specific phase of the interstellar medium  for example , hi , h@xmath205 , or co. collisionless particles can approximate gas dynamics , but only if the gas moves ballistically ; streams of particles freely interpenetrate , whereas gas will be deflected if it encounters shocks .",
    "examples include mass transfer via genuine bridges formed in low - inclination encounters @xcite and `` splash bridges '' due to hydrodynamic forces in interpenetrating encounters @xcite .",
    "more subtle are the modest star  gas offsets seen in low - inclination encounters with extended gas disks @xcite ; it appears that the gas offset from the stars does follow ballistic trajectories , while some gas initially associated with the stars dissipates and falls back .",
    "additionally , shocks may change the physical state of the gas ; in particular , dense molecular gas is often associated with material which has undergone significant dissipation and hence _ can not _ be modeled collisionlessly .",
    "but for most encounter geometries , gas in tidal features should be well - approximated by collisionless particles ; exceptions can be recognized and allowed for in the fitting process .",
    "stars , especially populations pre - dating the onset of an encounter , could be a useful complement to gas - phase tracers ; absorption - line spectroscopy would require prohibitively large amounts of telescope time , but individual planetary nebulae are already providing kinematic data for nearby systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "third , two parameters were not included in the present experiment : the orbital eccentricity @xmath12 and the mass ratio @xmath14 . in principle",
    "it s straightforward to include these parameters in the fitting process , although doing so increases the number of identikit models needed .",
    "both parameters have a priori constraints  orbits with @xmath206 are favored theoretically ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) , while @xmath14 can sometimes be estimated photometrically assuming constant @xmath207 ratios  so it seemed reasonable to exclude them from the initial experiments . putting these parameters in play",
    "would probably increase the scatter in our fits ; moreover , the three - way correlation between residuals of @xmath18 , @xmath13 , and @xmath20 (   [ sec : residuals ] ) might expand to involve residuals of @xmath12 and @xmath14 as well . within the context of the models examined here , there s scant reason to expect much cross - talk between these parameters and others ; in particular , disk orientations and viewing angles are robustly constrained by tidal features and should be well determined even if @xmath12 and @xmath14 are included in the fits .",
    "fourth , real galaxies have a range of rotation curve shapes , reflecting a diversity of mass profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; a single mass model is too limited . the fact that we used the same mass model for our artificial data _ and _ for the identikit simulations no doubt helped to reduce the uncertainties in our solutions .",
    "there s no reason why identikit simulations can not include a variety of mass models , although this will increase the number of choices to be made in modeling a galactic collision . on the other hand , if such simulations can discriminate between different mass models then they would provide a way to analyze the structure of disk galaxies .",
    "models of interacting galaxies have a long history .",
    "@xcite presented test - particle models of four systems : arp  295 , m  51 , ngc  4676 , and ngc  4038/9 ; the latter three have been revisited time and again by other workers .",
    "kinematic information was initially scarce and of uneven quality , so early modeling attempts focused on reproducing the optical morphology .",
    "better velocity data has given kinematics a more substantial role in more recent modeling efforts . at the same time , faster computers and n - body algorithms have enabled researchers to construct models incorporating self - gravity .",
    "the methodology adopted by @xcite in their model of the well - known merger remnant ngc  7252 includes several key practices found in other successful models :    1 .",

    "4 .   test - particle models , with rigid galaxy potentials constrained to follow realistic merger trajectories ,",
    "were used to narrow down the range of parameter space .",
    "fully self - consistent n - body models were used to refine the final model .",

    ", the studies in table  [ dynamical_models ] all followed the methodology used by @xcite .",
    "most had access to detailed velocity information , usually obtained by hi interferometry or h@xmath205 fabry - perot imaging , although a few models were based on long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "adopted orbital eccentricities reflect a range of assumptions , not all equally plausible ; for most systems , orbits with @xmath206 seem more likely since @xmath208 begs the question of what happened on the _ previous _ passage .",
    "both test - particle and self - consistent techniques were used .",
    "not all models were refined using fully self - consistent simulations ; inasmuch as orbital decay is critical for many of these systems , the use of rigid potentials may be problematic in some cases .",
    "as the third column of table  [ dynamical_models ] shows , a wide range of criteria were used to define an acceptable match to the observations .",
    "many studies still seemed more focused on morphology than kinematics , and less than half presented compelling quantitative comparisons between models and data .",
    "matches labeled `` kin2 '' used 2-d kinematical information , and presented the models and data in such a way that direct and unambiguous comparisons could easily be made  ideally , the model and data were overplotted , or at a minimum plotted to the same scale and orientation .",
    "matches labeled `` kin1 '' used 1-d data ( e.g. , long - slit spectra or mean velocities plotted as functions of a single coordinate ) , but again compared models and data directly .",
    "a few studies , labeled `` gen '' ( for genetic ) , evaluated matches numerically ; these will be discussed in   [ sec : genetic ] .",
    "most of the remaining studies , while drawing on spatially - resolved kinematic information , presented essentially qualitative comparisons between models and data ; these matches are labeled `` qual '' in the table .",
    "this designation is rather broad , ranging from studies which plotted models and data on different scales to studies which matched general kinematic trends or asserted , without providing quantitative evidence , that the model matched the data . finally , a few studies which matched morphology only are designated `` morph '' ; these are included when they served as precursors to more comprehensive modeling efforts .    the present study , while restricted to artificial data , closely parallels the approach of @xcite .",
    "we depart from them in treating the pericentric separation @xmath13 as a free parameter , and in not using fully self - consistent simulations to finalize the models .",
    "the latter , of course , is deliberate ; one of our goals was to see if an approach combining test - particle disks with self - consistent halos can recover the encounter parameters of interacting disk galaxies . in practice , we envision using identikit models to jump - start fully self - consistent simulations . we strongly concur that kinematic data provide an acid test which any dynamical model must pass @xcite , and that large - scale tidal features are the key to unlocking the dynamical history of galactic encounters .",
    "finally , we emphasize that direct and unambiguous comparison between the simulations and the `` observational '' data was a necessary ingredient of our approach . overplotting the particles on the data , as in fig .",
    "[ idkit_match ] , is an effective way to present such comparisons .",
    "to date , most attempts to model interacting galaxies have relied on expert judgement in selecting initial conditions and identifying good matches between simulations and observations . recognizing the considerable labour involved , several groups have tried to automate the modeling process @xcite .",
    "the proposed algorithms have two essential components .",
    "first , they must replace the subjective comparison of the simulation particles ( @xmath209 ) and the observed data ( @xmath210 ) with an objective criterion @xmath211 measuring goodness of fit .",
    "second , they must perform an efficient search of a very large parameter space . in view of the number of parameters involved ,",
    "a blind search is impractical ; these groups have adopted strategies mimicking biological evolution , generally known as _",
    "genetic algorithms _ @xcite",
    ".    genetic algorithms create a population of @xmath212 individuals , each representing a possible solution to the problem at hand ; in this case , an individual defines a set of initial conditions and viewing parameters .",
    "the evolutionary fitness of individual @xmath32 is determined by using its initial conditions and viewing parameters to produce a particle distribution @xmath213 which is evaluated using @xmath214 .",
    "once all @xmath212 individuals have been evaluated , the fittest among them are bred together to form a new generation , and the entire process is repeated .",
    "after @xmath215 generations , the population converges toward a nearly - optimal ensemble , with the fittest individual representing the best approximation to the desired solution .",
    "genetic algorithms for modeling interacting galaxies have been tested on artificial data @xcite and applied to real data for ngc  4449 @xcite and ngc  5194/95 @xcite .",
    "typical values of @xmath216 and @xmath217 imply that @xmath218 individuals must be evaluated to obtain a good match ; with test - particle methods , this can be done in a few hours of cpu time . the identikit methodology (   [ sec : methodology ]",
    ") could be combined with a genetic algorithm , improving the treatment of orbital decay and substantially reducing the cpu time required to find a match",
    ".    however , the output of a genetic algorithm will be no better than the evaluation function @xmath211 used to determine fitness .",
    "the simplest approach is to coarsely grid @xmath209 on the @xmath6 plane , and compare the result with an equally coarse gridding of @xmath210 .",
    "more recent implementations incorporate velocity information as well , and there s no reason why gridding ca nt be extended to 3-d @xmath219 data .",
    "but the first two limitations of the identikit method noted above also apply to existing evaluation functions .",
    "features due to self - gravity in real systems can be discounted by an expert when attempting to fit a test - particle model , but may mislead an objective evaluation function , lowering the fitness of accurate solutions .",
    "and while hi is a good tracer of kinematics , its distribution in tidal features is often quite irregular ; for example , a tail may appear as a series of clumps rather than a connected structure .",
    "an expert can recognize such tails as connected structures , but an automatic procedure may reject solutions which populate them with a smooth distribution of particles . to address these problems ,",
    "recent genetic algorithm implementations include routines for masking or weighting the observational data ; it remains to be seen if these techniques make genetic algorithms competitive with human experts .",
    "can a dynamical model reproducing the morphology and kinematics of an interacting pair of galaxies be considered unique ?",
    "claims to this effect occasionally appear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "yet claims of uniqueness seem overconfident .",
    "a particular match may be unique _ within the universe of possibilities defined by a given model _ , implying that all the parameters appearing in the model can be determined within reasonable accuracy , and that no set of parameters outside this tolerance range yield as good a match . however , this is _ not _ the same thing as uniquely determining the dynamical state of a pair of colliding galaxies , which is specified by the distribution function @xmath1 .    the problem of dynamically modeling isolated early - type galaxies , which has generated an extensive literature , illustrates some of the difficulties involved in determining @xmath1 .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use schwarzschild s ( @xcite ) method to fit models with equilibrium distribution functions depending on three integrals of motion to stellar velocity data obtained from integral field spectroscopy .",
    "such models are quite successful at describing the orbital structure of galaxies and diagnosing the presence of black holes and dark halos . but not many of these models are truly unique ; the orientations and intrinsic shapes of axisymmetric models appear uncertain @xcite , while triaxial models pose additional difficulties @xcite .",
    "determining @xmath1 for one galaxy is hard ; doing so for a pair of galaxies seems harder still .    to 0.10    in the context of the model described here , it may not even be obvious that we can hope to constrain even the most basic parameters .",
    "the orientation of a single disk , unless it happens to be exactly edge - on , can not be determined from a data cube @xmath47 ; for example , a disk tilted by @xmath222 to the line of sight produces _ exactly _ the same data cube as one tilted by @xmath223 .",
    "( this ambiguity can be resolved by using dust lanes to determine which side of the disk is closer , although doing so goes beyond a strictly kinematic approach to galaxy modeling ; see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite . ) by extension , a pair of disks yield a four - fold degenerate solution , since each disk has two possible orientations .",

    "we did not examine errors in center - of - mass position and velocity , but the offsets in our fits were always very small , so presumably these parameters are also well - constrained .",
    "while some solutions are better than others , all @xmath224 of these fits appear to be unique ; the estimated parameters are always in the neighborhood of the actual values , and often very close indeed .",
    "the @xmath123 `` poor '' fits tell a different story .",
    "object  16 ( see fig .  [ random_mergers ] ) , a wide retrograde encounter `` observed ''",

    "other poor solutions may also be degenerate , in view of the large misalignments in viewing direction and disk orientation they display ( see figs .  [ cdf_spin ] and [ cdf_view ] ) .",
    "the fact that we were able to produce well - constrained and reasonably accurate solutions for @xmath224 out of @xmath0 systems depends critically on the quality of the `` observational '' data we used .",
    "data with lower resolution and added noise would yield a less favorable outcome ; in particular , incomplete velocity information can seriously compromise a solution",
    ". models of ngc  7252 illustrate this point ; early attempts using very limited velocity data concluded that this object resulted from a merger of two _ retrograde _",
    "disks @xcite , but once high - quality hi data was available a very convincing solution involving a collision of two _ direct _ disks was soon found @xcite .",
    "fortunately , instruments like the expanded very large array now coming on - line should make it far easier to obtain the detailed velocity information needed to accurately constrain dynamical models of interacting galaxies .",
    "however , even a surfeit of data will not guarantee an unambiguous model in every case .",
    "one example may be the `` whirlpool '' galaxy , ngc  5194/95 ; after three and a half decades of modeling based on ever - better hi data there is still no consensus regarding the number of passages required to account for ngc  5194 s optical morphology _ and _ extended hi tail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one possible solution to this puzzle is to assume that ngc  5194 s hi disk was warped even _ before _ its first and only encounter with ngc  5195 ; this could tilt the tail with respect to the inner disk in such a way as to match the observed velocities .",
    "of course , pre - existing warps vastly complicate questions of uniqueness ! in the specific case of ngc  5194/95 , stronger evidence in favor of a single passage seems necessary to justify introducing such a warp ; better data on _ stellar _ velocities may help @xcite .",
    "our limited knowledge of dark matter is a more fundamental barrier to the creation of truly unique models for interacting galaxies .",
    "models of isolated galaxies in equilibrium can represent the dark matter as a potential imposed by hand .",

    "a good model of a galactic collision can serve as a unifying hypothesis , providing a context to integrate and interpret a variety of observations ; for example , a time - line of past encounters may help to understand interaction - induced star formation .",
    "conversely , a bad model which contradicts other lines of evidence can be rejected .",
    "viewed as a means to an end , dynamical modeling stands to teach us a good deal about galactic encounters and galaxies in general .",
    "while the current identikit system is essentially an interactive modeling tool , the basic approach offers other possibilities .",
    "for example , once the orbital parameters @xmath13 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 , time @xmath18 , viewing angles @xmath19 , and scale factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been fixed , it is possible to invert the mapping from initial disk orientation @xmath225 to the data cube @xmath226 , and ask which @xmath225 values allow a disk to populate a given point in the @xmath219 space . as a rule",
    ", each @xmath219 point corresponds to some range of @xmath225 values , but _",
    "different _ points along one tidal structure should all be populated by the _",
    "same _ disk , so this range can be constrained .",
    "this approach could effectively automate the process of finding disk orientations once other parameters have been selected ; it could particularly useful in establishing confidence limits for key parameters once an initial match has been determined .",
    "the identikit technique has some interesting similarities to schwarzschild s ( @xcite ) method for building triaxial equilibrium systems . in a nutshell ,",
    "schwarzschild started with a stationary mass model , populated it with all possible orbits , and figured out how to add up the time - averaged density distributions of these orbits so as to recover the original mass model .",
    "we start with a time - dependent mass model generated by an encounter of two spherical systems ; each sphere is initially populated with all possible circular orbits .",
    "but instead of finding a weighted sum of these orbits which reproduces the mass distribution , we try to select one co - planar family of orbits from each sphere to match the observed kinematics and morphology of interacting galaxies .",
    "perhaps some variant of the algorithms used in schwarzschild s method to determine orbital weights could be applied to the problem of modeling interacting galaxies .",
    "we hope to implement some of these extensions in identikit  2 .",

    "this initial drop indicates that the model was not started in perfect equilibrium , but the implied rearrangement of mass is only a little larger than the @xmath345 ( @xmath346 ) fluctuations occurring in an n - body system with this @xmath347 .",
    "apart from transient spiral structure , this model showed no significant features until the disk begins to develop a bar at time @xmath348 .",

    "the value of @xmath21 is usually determined toward the end of the matching process ; after values have been selected for most other parameters , we adjust @xmath21 to obtain a good overall match between the particles and the grey - scale images in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 planes .",
    "there are a number of factors which may influence the choice for @xmath21 , including the velocity difference between the galaxies and the characteristic velocities of tidal features .",

    "[ galmod ] shows , the circular velocity profile of the identikit model rises more rapidly , peaks at a smaller radius , and then falls slightly below either the circular ( @xmath303 ) or mean ( @xmath294 ) profiles in the self - gravitating model .",
    "[ fitvscale ] shows an identikit fit to a self - consistent disk galaxy model .",
    "this disk is tilted by @xmath222 to the line of sight ; in fitting this model , the orientation and length scale factor were first set to their actual values .",

    "the value of @xmath352 selected in this manner is @xmath353% too high , much as in the identikit matches to interacting galaxies . in hindsight , we note that the @xmath43 projection shows a handful of points falling outside the rotation curve for large @xmath354 ; a fit giving priority to these points would have recovered a more accurate value for @xmath21 .",
    "compared to its identikit analog , the larger velocity width of the self - consistent disk is a direct consequence of the random velocities imparted to individual disk particles . to test this , we constructed self - consistent disks with different dispersions and velocity scales , and selected best - fit values of @xmath352 as in fig .",
    "[ fitvscale ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath355 has a one - to - one relationship with the disk s velocity dispersion ; the larger the dispersion , the greater the overestimate of @xmath21 .",
    "it s likely that by constructing identikit models with random velocities comparable to those present in the self - gravitating disks we could largely remove this bias . however , `` cold '' disks may actually be more appropriate when fitting kinematics observed in cold gas tracers ( e.g. , hi or co ) , since these have smaller velocity dispersions than most stellar components .",
