    "there is a great concern about the nature of itinerant ferromagnetism in correlated electron systems with disorder , such as , e.g. , doped manganites ( la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2),@xcite alloyed ruthenates ( srru@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2),@xcite or alloyed kondo insulators ( fesi@xmath0ge@xmath1).@xcite moreover , it is of fundamental importance for industrial applications to precisely control the curie temperature of different ferromagnetic alloys or diluted magnetic semiconductors , e.g. @xmath3.@xcite    in typical transition metals ( e.g. fe , ni or co ) the subtle competition between kinetic and coulomb energies together with the pauli principle leads to the occurrence of a ferromagnetic phase . since the transition happens when both contributions to the total energy are of the same order , theoretical methods to study such systems have to be nonperturbative.@xcite within the dynamical mean  field theory ( dmft),@xcite which is genuine nonperturbative , detail conditions for occurrence of ferromagnetism in a one  band hubbard model were elucidated.@xcite the same nonperturbative scheme together with a density functional theory in the local density approximation was used to describe ferromagnetic phases of fe and ni.@xcite the presence of a binary alloy disorder introduces a new nonperturbative aspect into the problem .",

    "all those effects , as explained below , are caused by a subtle interplay between alloy band splitting and correlations .",
    "the present work is motivated by real experimental situations where the tuning parameter is rather @xmath7 than @xmath4 .",
    "namely , while the latter is fixed for given atoms the former can be varied by making different alloy compositions or changing chemical stoichiometry .",
    "thereby , the controlling of curie temperature @xmath15 is experimentally accessible .",
    "the examples are bcc fe - co or fcc ni - cu alloys.@xcite in the first case , due to alloying , the system is driven from weak to strong ferromagnetism , whereas in the latter case the system is changed from a ferromagnet to a paramagnet . interestingly ,",
    "the behavior of the saturated magnetization and the curie temperature in fe - co are non - monotonous functions of @xmath7 reaching maxima at @xmath16 concentration of co.@xcite another interesting examples are pyrite alloys t@xmath0t@xmath1s@xmath17 , where t ( t ) stands for transition metals : fe , co , ni , cu , zn.@xcite starting from fes@xmath17 and alloying it with co , the empty @xmath18 band ( fes@xmath17 is a narrow - band semiconductor ) is progressively filled in with electrons and the system becomes a disordered itinerant ferromagnet .",

    "it is however numerically solvable in an infinite dimension after a proper rescaling of the hopping parameters,@xcite i.e. a set of self  consistent dmft equations is derived.@xcite the local nature of the theory implies that short - range order in position space is missing .",
    "however , dynamical correlations due to the local interaction and disorder@xcite are fully taken into account .    in the dmft scheme",

    "curie temperatures are obtained by the divergence of the homogeneous magnetic susceptibility explicitly implying that the ferromagnetic phase transitions are of the second order.@xcite",
    "the curie temperature as a function of alloy concentration exhibits very rich and interesting behavior as is documented in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is usually expected that @xmath15 is suppressed in disordered systems .",
    "this indeed is found for most cases when @xmath7 is varied between zero and one .",
    "however , at some concentrations and certain values of @xmath8 , @xmath4 and @xmath14 , the curie temperature is enhanced above the corresponding value for the non - disordered case ( @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is shown in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath61 and in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath62 .",
    "the relative increase of @xmath9 can be as large as @xmath63 , as is found for @xmath64 at @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this unusual enhancement of @xmath9 is caused by three distinct features of interacting electrons in the presence of binary alloy disorder:@xcite    \\i ) the curie temperature in the non - disordered case @xmath68 , depends non - monotonically on band filling @xmath14 .",
    "namely , @xmath69 has a maximum at some filling @xmath70 , which increases as @xmath8 is increased;@xcite see also our schematic plots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "\\ii ) as was described above , in the alloy disordered system the band is split when @xmath71 . as a consequence , for @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    "electrons occupy only the lower alloy subband and for @xmath74 both the lower and upper alloy subbands are filled . in the former case",
    "the upper subband is empty while in the later case the lower subband is completely full .",
    "effectively , one can therefore describe this system by a hubbard model mapped onto the either lower or the upper alloy subband , respectively .",
    "the second subband plays a passive role .",
    "hence , the situation corresponds to a _",
    "single _ band with the _ effective _ filling @xmath75 for @xmath72 and @xmath76 for @xmath74 .",
    "it is then possible to determine @xmath9 from the phase diagram of the hubbard model without disorder.@xcite    \\iii ) the disorder leads to a reduction of @xmath77 by a factor @xmath78 if the fermi level is in the lower alloy subband or @xmath79 if it is in the upper alloy subband , i.e.  we find @xmath80 when @xmath81 ( c.f .",
    "appendix ) .",
    "hence , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig4 ] , @xmath9 can be determined by @xmath77 .",
    "surprisingly , then , it follows that , for suitable @xmath8 and @xmath14 curie temperature of a disordered system can be higher than that of the corresponding non - disordered system [ cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] .",
    "the explanation of the @xmath15 enhancement , given above , is supported by a detailed analysis how @xmath9 changes when @xmath4 increases at fixed @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at @xmath82 and @xmath65 ; examples at @xmath83 already have been presented in ref .",
    "[ ] . for @xmath74 ( results in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] corresponds to this regime ) the curie temperature initially decreases upon increasing @xmath4 from zero .",
    "however , when @xmath84 the trend is inverted and @xmath9 increases , finally saturating . at @xmath85",
    "the alloy band splitting becomes effective , changing the behavior of @xmath9 versus @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , only for small @xmath8 the curie temperature is elevated above the value at @xmath86 .",
    "this is strongly related to the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath87 , and in particular to the fact that its maximum changes with @xmath8 .",
    "namely , as is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , only at small interactions @xmath88 , which is a necessary condition for the enhancement of @xmath9 by disorder . in the @xmath72 case ,",
    "on the other hand , the necessary condition @xmath89 for an enhancement of @xmath9 implies that the interaction must be strong.@xcite      the two different cases @xmath72 and @xmath74 ( when @xmath71 ) should correspond to two different behaviors of a saturated magnetization , i.e.  the magnetization for @xmath90 .",
    "namely , in the first case only the lower alloy subband is occupied and the magnetization @xmath91 , where @xmath92 are the average numbers of electrons with spin up or down .",
    "however , in the second case @xmath93 since the lower alloy subband is split off and fully occupied by the electrons with two spin species , thereby being magnetically neutral .",
    "in order to confirm this physical picture we calculate the magnetization @xmath94 as a function of temperature .",
    "the resultant magnetizations together with the inverse static susceptibilities @xmath95 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for two cases : i ) @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( filled and open circles ) , corresponding to @xmath72 case , and ii ) @xmath82 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( filled and open squares ) corresponding to @xmath74 instance . at both parameter sets @xmath9",
    "is enhanced by the alloy band splitting ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the numerically calculated magnetization ( filled circles and squares ) follow very closely the theoretical brillouin curves ( dashed and solid lines).@xcite the magnetization data , shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] , are consistent with our conjecture that the saturated magnetization should be : @xmath99 in case ( i ) , whereas @xmath100 in case ( ii ) .",
    "two interesting observations are made : firstly , in the case ( ii ) ( with @xmath74 ) , the presence of disorder increases @xmath9 while the saturated magnetization is suppressed below its value at @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the disordered system becomes a weaker ferromagnet but with higher @xmath9 .",
    "secondly , although the correlated electrons in the disordered system are itinerant , the magnetization @xmath94 is well reproduced by the brillouin curve , albeit formally this curve is derived for localized moments.@xcite the last observation calls for an analytical proof within dmft analogous to that already given for the linear behavior of the inverse susceptibility.@xcite    within dmft the uniform spin susceptibility for a systems with paramagnet  ferromagnet phase transition obeys the curie ",
    "weiss law @xmath101,@xcite where @xmath102 is a curie constant .",
    "the same curie ",
    "weiss law is also derived with a mean  field theory for localized magnetic moments and in this case the curie constant is directly proportional to the saturated magnetization . to check whether similar relation holds for itinerant electron system within dmft",
    "we compute the curie constants obtaining : @xmath103 in the case ( i ) , and @xmath104 in the case ( ii ) .",
    "it turns out that the ratio @xmath105 is very close to the ratio of saturated magnetizations @xmath106 .",
    "this result provides a new interpretation of the curie constant within dmft , i.e. @xmath102 is proportional to the saturated magnetization , similarly as in localized magnetic moment theory .",
    "in addition this finding corroborates our initial conjecture regarding saturated magnetization in two physically different cases @xmath72 and @xmath74 at large @xmath4 .      upon increasing @xmath8 and @xmath4 , the mott ",
    "hubbard mit occurs at the electronic filling @xmath10.@xcite such mit can also be encountered by varying @xmath7 .",
    "this mit will be called an _ alloy concentration controlled mott transition_. approaching a correlated insulator the itinerant ferromagnetism is also suppressed due to localization of the electrons . using linearized dmft@xcite it was estimated@xcite that when @xmath107 the critical interaction @xmath108 .",
    "such estimation leads to @xmath109 for @xmath97 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and to @xmath110 for @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this means that at @xmath67 and @xmath98 ( lower panels in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  and  [ fig2 ] ) the mott ",
    "hubbard mit is possible at @xmath111 .      at large @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath4 the system encounters several quantum ( @xmath112 ) phase transitions when @xmath7 is varied .",
    "one is the mott ",
    "hubbard mit discussed above .",
    "the other is the transition from a ferromagnetic metal to a paramagnetic metal . in this quantum phase transition",
    "the curie temperature vanishes at @xmath113 which is different from @xmath111 , where mott ",
    "hubbard mit occurs .",
    "the presence of the quantum phase transitions should affect the properties of the disordered fermi liquid at finite temperatures , provided that the system is of finite dimensionality .",
    "this scenario would be worth to be investigated including spatial correlations , which however goes beyond the present dmft framework .",
    "in many alloys the change in the concentration @xmath7 alters the electron density @xmath14 . in this section",
    "we investigate @xmath15 when @xmath7 and @xmath14 are varied simultaneously .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig5 ] are obtained under the assumption that @xmath114 . when @xmath59 the band is empty ( the system is a band insulator ) . upon increasing @xmath7 from zero to one , the band filling increases from zero to one  half ( quarter filled band ) .",
    "this model realization would correspond to the physical situation in fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath17 alloy if the number of states in @xmath18 band is normalized to one .",
    "of course , this analogy should not be stressed too far since in our model an important exchange interaction ( hund s coupling ) is absent .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the presence of disorder at weak interaction always suppresses the curie temperature with respect to the non  disorder case .",
    "however , at large @xmath8 and @xmath115 the curie temperature is larger than that in the pure case at the same filling .",
    "this difference again can be understood on the basis provided by the scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in the present case @xmath72 for all @xmath7 , and only the lower alloy subband plays a role in the effective description at large @xmath4 . in this limit",
    "this subband is effectively filled with @xmath116 electrons . using the same arguments as in the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we see that @xmath15 is enhanced only for large @xmath8 .",
    "in the present paper we studied the one  band anderson  hubbard model with binary alloy disorder showing that the curie temperature in such alloyed correlated electron system can reach higher values than those in the non - disorder system .",
    "we also identified and discussed the metal ",
    "insulator transition at non - integer fillings .",
    "additionally possible quantum phase transitions at zero temperature were described pointing out on a possible interesting quantum critical behavior of a disordered fermi liquid .",
    "this work completes previous studies of itinerant ferromagnetism in the pure and disordered hubbard model within dmft.@xcite    regarding the physical systems , it is now of great importance to extend the one  band hubbard model with alloy disorder to a multi  band case and formulate the adequate version of dmft for solving this problem .",

    "within the hartree - fock approximation one can find analytically that in the strong disordered limit @xmath81 the self  energy has the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the magnetization density .",
    "this self  energy leads to the splitting of the density of states with @xmath7 and @xmath32 of the initial states in each alloy subband .",
