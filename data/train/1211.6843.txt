    "one curious aspect , recently confirmed by fabrication of periodic arrays of thin metallic wires @xcite , is the existence of left - handed materials , so - called because the electric , magnetic and direction of propagation vectors form a left - handed triad , resulting in a metamaterial with negative refractive index .",
    "another interesting aspect is the nature of inter - particle interactions in media with electrical permittivity , magnetic permeability , or both .",
    "this has its origins in the work of casimir @xcite , subsequently spawning a wide variety of related phenomena categorized under casimir - like effects @xcite , and including the casimir  polder ( cp ) dispersion potential @xcite .",

    "unexpected results ensue such as the discriminatory nature of the interaction between two chiral ( optically active ) molecules ; the repulsive form of the ground state dispersion energy shift between an electrically polarizable atom and a paramagnetically susceptible one ; and that in the near - zone , the electric  diamagnetic contribution to this potential is larger than the corresponding limit arising from the electric ",
