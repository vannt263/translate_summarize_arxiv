    "mass is one of the most fundamental parameters of a star .",
    "unfortunately , stellar mass is difficult to be determined directly .",
    "therefore , it is often estimated by mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) .    since the pioneering papers of hertzsprung ( 1923 ) and russell et al . ( 1923 ) there have been many studies devoted to improving and understanding mlr . to date , the relation has been well constrained for solar - type and intermediate stars @xcite .",
    "but the empirical mlr remains poorly defined for very low mass stars due to scarcity of data . on the other hand , however , the empirical mlr for very low mass stars is crucial in many aspects of astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "for example , without an accurate mlr in this mass interval , the total luminous mass of the galaxy will never be well determined @xcite .",
    "this is because very low mass stars account for at least 70% of all stars , and they make up more than 40% of the total stellar mass of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "recently , the mlr for very low mass stars has been improved significantly , thanks to the painstaking observations and the required orbital analysis .",
    "henry et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained or improved some dynamical masses of very low mass stars and discussed the mlr for the mass interval 0.2 @xmath0to 0.08 @xmath0 .",
    "delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) pointed out that mlr is tight only in near - infrared bands . together with the improved mlrs in k , j and h bands",
    ", they suggested that the large dispersion in v band should be due to the difference in stellar metallicity . in bonfils",
    "( 2005 ) , with quantitative metallicity estimations , the authors verified this metallicity dependency and provided visual mass - metallicity - luminosity relation ( mmlr ) for the first time .    despite of these progresses ,",
    "the empirical mlr for low mass stars obtained so far is still not satisfying .",
    "the existence of a transitional mass interval , where the derivative of mlr presents a plateau feature , is an intrinsic obstacle to a satisfying result .",
    "this is because a continuous yet segmented model is needed for mlr . while more data are often necessary for fitting to a segmented model than a non - segmented one , some data with relatively low accuracy were discarded in the previous work",
    "this is not without reason , as many of the data are prone to systematics . obviously , to remove such data",
    ", it should be more reasonable to require that the remaining data set is well behaved . and at the same time , one should avoid discarding data more than necessary , such that the original data set can be fully utilized . based on a newly developed weight assigning scheme , we are able to achieve this by an iterative process and , as thus , give a more confident mlr . in comparison with previous work @xcite ,",
    "the improvement of mlr in ( 0.7 @xmath0 , 1.0@xmath0 ) also comes from incorporating more observational data , and that in ( 0.1@xmath0 , 0.7@xmath0 ) from taking into account the underlying physics .    in section 2 and section 3 ,",
    "respectively , we describe our sample data and develop a fitting method with a reasonable weight assigning scheme . in section 4 , the best - fitting three - piecewise empirical mlrs in k , j , h and",
    "v bands , the mmlr in v band are provided .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "in order to map out mlr for low mass main sequence stars , we need a sample of dynamical masses derived from orbital analysis @xcite and absolute magnitudes . by searching the literatures ,",
    "the resulting sample of 48 main sequence stars is listed in table 1 .",
    "the columns of table 1 are , respectively , name of these stars , the dynamical mass ( @xmath1 ) ( spanning from 0.07 @xmath0@xmath21.086 @xmath0 ) , absolute v magnitude ( @xmath3 ) , absolute k magnitude ( @xmath4 ) , absolute j magnitude ( @xmath5 ) and absolute h magnitude ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "most of the data can be found directly from the literatures except that some values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are obtained from apparent magnitudes ( color index if necessary ) and parallaxes .",
    "the types of spectrum as well as references are also indicated .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , > , < ,",
    "< , < , > , < , > , < , < , < \" , ]     del00 used a non - segmented fourth - order polynomial model in ( 0.1@xmath0 , 0.7@xmath0 ) .",
    "so for his mlr , the slope in the plateau is increased and in the other mass regions the slopes are decreased .",
    "on the basis of an increase of three parameters , the values of @xmath9 are calculated and listed in the third column of table 2 . from this table",
    ", we can see that our mlrs in k , h and v bands have statistically significant improvement to del00 . and the values of @xmath10 are reduced about 40% . for j band , due to",
    "the number of observational data is the fewest , our improvement is not as obvious as in the other bands and the @xmath10 is reduced about 15% .    for v band , the difference in stellar metallicity induces a large scatter while the near - infrared relations are much tighter @xcite . with observational estimations of metallicity , bonfils et al",
    "( 2005 ) provided mmlr for the first time .",
    "we collect the latest data from woolf & wallerstein ( 2006 ) and with an improved three - piecewise k band mlr , an improved v - band mmlr is provided in the same way as bonfils et al .",
    "the resulting formula writes : @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for m @xmath12$]@xmath0 , [ fe / h ] @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "in this paper , based on a new reasonable weight assigning scheme , we try to make the best use of the present observations to restrict mlrs in k , j , h , v bands and mmlr in v band for low mass stars .",
    "further improvements of this relation would have to come from future observations @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for the transitional mass interval .",
    "apart from its importance in estimating stellar masses , the empirical mlr in this mass interval is important in testifying simulations aimed at understanding the underlying physics .",
    "since the precision of observations depends heavily on vastly different situations of individual stars , we believe the weight assigning scheme developed in the present paper will be helpful in the relevant studies .",
    "furthermore , for relations like mlr , only good schemes can demonstrate those not obvious features thus can improve the corresponding physical investigation .",
    "it should be pointed that , while it is very interesting to quantify how empirical mlr in v band depends on metallicity , further improvements to the presently available observations seem to be necessary . besides , the age - dependency of empirical mlr , which remains to be poorly defined due to the fact that there are few confident observations available @xcite , also demands more painstaking observational efforts .    _",
