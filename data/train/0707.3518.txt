    "regions are essential tools for the study of the chemical composition and star formation in the universe , specially in the extragalactic domain .",
    "it is necessary to be confident that our traditional techniques for deriving chemical abundances in ionized nebulae ( based on the analysis of intensity ratios of colisionally excited lines , cels ) provide the real values .",
    "forty years ago , @xcite characterized the temperature structure of a gaseous nebula to a second order by two parameters : the average temperature , @xmath3 and the mean square temperature fluctuation , _ @xmath4_. at least , two independent methods of determining the electron temperature @xmath5 of the nebula with different weights in the high and low temperature regions are necessary to derive @xmath3 and _ @xmath4_. in their observations , @xcite found that the temperature derived from the balmer discontinuity , using the intensity ratio bj/@xmath6(h@xmath7 ) where bj is the value of the balmer jump , was systematically lower than that derived from the [ ] 4363/5007 cels ratio .",
    "this result has been corroborated by several subsequent works ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and we will refer to this problem as the temperature discrepancy .",
    "later , @xcite claimed that , in the presence of temperature variations over the observed volume of the nebula , the gaseous abundances derived from the analysis of intensity ratios of cels are underestimated if these temperature fluctuations are not considered .",
    "this is due to the strong dependence of the intensity of those lines on the assumed @xmath5 .",
    "this possibility is annoying , considering that the analysis of cels is the standard method for deriving ionic abundances in ionized nebulae . on the other hand , intensity ratios of optical recombination lines ( orls )",
    "are almost independent of the temperature structure of the nebula , and could be more appropiate to derive the `` real '' abundances of the nebulae . in the last years , several measurements of orls on regions and planetary nebulae ( pne ) have been done , and it has been found that abundance determinations from orls are systematically higher than those obtained using cels , independently of the ion considered ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this is usually known as the abundance discrepancy problem .",
    "thanks to the fast technological progress related to the development of large telescopes and better detectors and to the significant improvement in the understanding of the recombination theory for multielectronic atomic systems , many works have been dedicated to understand the origin of the abundance and temperature discrepancies . during the last years , it has been confirmed that both effects are real , and that they are not related neither to systematic biases in the observations nor in the basic atomic physics .",
    "in addition , it has been found that the two dichotomies can be intimately related ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the high surface brightness of the brightest pne has permitted to detect many orls of heavy elements in these objects .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite in ngc  7009 , was the first in calling the attention on the different o@xmath0 abundance obtained from orls and [ ] cels .",
    "later , @xcite and @xcite also remarked the excess of carbon observed in some pne when calculating the c@xmath0 abundance from orls . since the availability of the @xmath8 satellite , carbon abundances from uv cels could be determined , obtaining abundances systematically smaller than those derived from orls ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during the last decade many efforts have been done to understand the physical conditions under which the different types of spectral lines are formed in pne . in particular",
    ", the use of medium - large aperture telescopes , has allowed that the catalogue of detected and orls in pne has increased spectacularly in the last years .",
    "the works dedicated to the study of the abundance discrepancy and/or the temperature structure in pne are fairly numerous ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the data collected in these works , indicate that the _ @xmath4 _",
    "parameter shows an extraordinary range of variation in pne , reaching very high values in some objects .",
    "@xcite , found values of _",
    "@xmath4 _ @xmath9 0.14 and 0.18 in hf 2 - 2 , from the abundance and temperature discrepancies , respectively . on the other hand , @xcite , from @xmath10 image and spectroscopy of pn ngc  7009 , found that the @xmath5 map of this nebula was practically uniform and that _ @xmath4 _ throughout the nebula on the plane of the sky was small ( _ @xmath4_@xmath11 = 0.0035 ) . in spite of the low _",
    "@xmath4 _ value found , it could not completely be discarded the existence of temperature fluctuations throughout the line of sight that could account for the observed abundance discrepancies in this object ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance discrepancy is commonly quantified using the so - called abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) , that is defined as : @xmath12    @xcite found a correlation between the adf and the difference between @xmath5 ( [ ] ) and @xmath5(bac ) .",
    "qualitatively , this correlation is consistent with the existence of temperature fluctuations , although these authors argue that abundance and temperature discrepancies are qualitatively better explained on the basis of a chemically inhomogenous or two - phase model . @xcite",
    "analized the emission line spectrum of the pn ngc  6153 , and concluded that the nebula contains a component of the ionized gas previously unknown cold and very metal - rich. later works have supported this model , sustaining it mainly in the fact that the [ ] fine structure far infrared ( fir ) lines at @xmath13 52 , 88 @xmath14 m which have very low excitation energies , of the order of 1000 k , and are almost insensible to the variations of @xmath5 give ionic abundances comparable to the ones obtained from uv and optical cels .",
    "these results are not compatible with the temperature fluctuations paradigm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but can be explained by a two - phase model ( see below ) .",
    "the observational features that allow us to determine the _ @xmath4 _ parameter ( orls , recombination continua ) are much more difficult to be accurately measured in regions than in pne .",
    "the low surface brightness of most of these objects has caused that , until a few years ago , the regions sample with",
    "_ @xmath4 _",
    "determinations available has been limited to a few galactic regions : the orion nebula @xcite , m8 @xcite and m17 @xcite , and to a few extragalactic regions @xcite . in the last four years",
    ", this sample has been extended with the works of @xcite on an additional galactic region ( ngc  3576 ) and 3 extragalactic ones ( 1 in the large magellanic cloud , lmc and 2 in the small magellanic cloud , smc ) ; @xcite on 30 doradus ; @xcite on 2 ngc  6822 regions ; and @xcite on the starburst galaxy ngc  5253 .",
    "aditionally , @xcite made a direct estimation of _",
    "@xmath4 _ in the plane of the sky of the orion nebula from deep wfc / hst images , and making some geometrical considerations found a value of _ @xmath4_=0.028@xmath150.006 , consistent with previous results ( _ @xmath4 _ between 0.020 and 0.030 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "finally , our group has obtained and analyzed extremely deep echelle spectra of a sample of 8 galactic regions @xcite . in 4 of them ( m16 , m20 , s  311 and ngc  3603 ) , and orls were detected , for the first time ; in other two regions ( orion nebula and ngc  3576 ) orls were also detected for the first time .    on the contrary , some puzzling results for the temperature fluctuations hypothesis have been recently found for some extragalactic regions . on the one hand , @xcite",
    "have measured @xmath5(bac ) in three compact galaxies of the second data emission release of the sdss reobserved with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , finding _",
    "@xmath4 _ s values close to zero for two of the objects , and a relatively large value ( _ @xmath4_@xmath90.066@xmath150.026 ) for the third . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have made a detailed study of a sample of 47 low metallicity regions in blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies and and 69 emission - line galaxies from the data release 3 of the sdss and m101 .",
    "these authors have measured the balmer and paschen jumps with the purpose of determining @xmath5 ( ) . from monte carlo simulations , they fit the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the galaxies and find that the temperatures in the o@xmath0 zone derived from [ ] @xmath13(4959 5007)/@xmath164363 ratio are , considering the dispersion of the data , equal to the temperature of the h@xmath1 zone , obtained from fitting the balmer jump and the sed . in any case , the dispersion of the data does not allow to discard small temperature fluctuations of about @xmath9 3%  5% .",
    "@xcite proposed a chemically inhomogeneous scenario for regions similar to that proposed for pne , but only very recently a physically reasonable model has been drawn @xcite .",
    "this scenario implies the presence of temperature fluctuations in the nebulae , but its resulting abundance pattern is not identical to the one found under the standard temperature fluctuations paradigm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "those authors postulate the presence of a gas component of high metallicity , and consequently low @xmath5 embedded in a less dense ambient gas , with lower metallicity and therefore larger temperature . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    ", this denser component could come from the resulting material of type ii sne that has not been mixed with the bulk of ism and that is in pressure balance with the normal composition ambient gas ( an scenario originally proposed by * ? ? ? * ) . according to this model",
    ", these inclusions would be responsible for most the orls emission and they would not emit in cels due to their low temperature .    in this paper , we present a global analysis of some results of our study of a sample of regions mainly focussed on discussing the properties and behavior of the abundance discrepancy problem in these objects .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in   [ datos ] we briefly describe the data we have analized . in   [ adfvsparam ]",

    ", we have recomputed the physical conditions and ionic and total abundances of some of our published results for some objects ( ngc  3576 , orion nebula , ngc  3603 ) using the same atomic data and ionization correction factors ( icf ) scheme than for the rest of the sample nebulae .",

    "in fact , it is not possible to distinguish between the nebular emission and stellar absorption features in the spectra of @xcite of n11b .",

    "these coefficients are the most appropriate ones for non gaussian distributions , as well as the two - sided significance of its deviation from zero ; the significance is a value in the interval [ 0.0 , 1.0 ] , and a small value indicates a significant correlation .",
    "one important result of our data compilation for regions is that the adf is fairly constant for these objects and of the order of 2 .",
    "this is a crucial difference with the behavior shown by this factor in pne , where it can vary from values of 1 up to 20 ( see   [ te_rls ] for a further discussion and references ) .    in figure  [ adfoxy2 ] to  [ adftemp ] we have represented the adf with respect to different nebular parameters , and in table  [ coefcorr ] we include the slope of the fits , their corresponding spearman s coefficients , @xmath69 , and the significance of the correlation , @xmath70 , for each of the aforementioned diagrams .",
    "as it can be seen in table  [ coefcorr ] the correlation coefficients for all the fits are very low and they have quite poor statistical significance . as in the rest of the cases , figure  [ adfoxy2 ] shows that the adf seems to be not related to o@xmath0/h@xmath1 nor o@xmath57/o@xmath0 , at least within the observational uncertainties . the metallicity dependency of the _ @xmath4 _",

    "also , there is no evidence that the adf is related to the effective temperature of ionizing stars as should be implied by photoelectric heating due to the presence of dust near the stars. we have explored the behavior of the adf with respect to the fwhm of the spectral lines finding no correlation although the result is not conclusive due to the paucity of objects with lines of large fwhm .",
    "we have found that the adf seems to be slightly related to the excitation energy , @xmath97 and to the critical density , @xmath84 ( in contrast to that observed in pne ) , a behavior that is not predicted by the two phase model initially proposed for pne and recently extended to regions @xcite , but consistent at least in the first aspect with the predictions of the standard temperature fluctuations paradigm . on the other hand , electron temperatures derived from orls",
    "are consistent with those derived from cels , within the uncertainties , also contradicting the large differences predicted by the two phase model .",
    "all these results suggest that the physical mechanism that produces the abundance discrepancy in pne and regions might be different .",

    "obtaining deep spectra of extragalactic regions is fundamental to check the different models proposed to explain the abundance discrepancy , permitting to extend the parameters space ( metallicity , ionization budget , kinematics , morphological complexity ) of the objects .",
