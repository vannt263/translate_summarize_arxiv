    "we derive filtered backprojection algorithms based on the inversion formulas for elliptical cylinders in @xmath23 and present numerical results .",
    "the paper concludes with a short discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we study the spherical radon transform with centers on a cylinder @xmath6 , where @xmath21 is any smooth hypersurface with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . it will be convenient to identify @xmath26 and to write any point in @xmath27 in the form @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 .",
    "the spherical radon transform of @xmath18 with a cylindrical center - set @xmath6 is defined by @xmath30    in the following we show that @xmath22 can be written as the product of two lower dimensional spherical radon transforms , one with a center - set @xmath1 in @xmath2 and one with a planar center - set in @xmath3 .",
    "these partial spherical radon transforms are defined as follows .    1 .   for @xmath29",

    "according to theorem  [ thm : factorization ] a possible strategy to recover the function @xmath57 from its spherical radon transform @xmath36 is by first inverting @xmath58 and subsequently inverting @xmath59 .",
    "formulas and algorithms for inverting the spherical radon transform @xmath35 with centers on a hyperplane are well known ; see @xcite . if @xmath1 is the boundary of a bounded domain @xmath60 , then efficient reconstruction algorithms for recovering a function with support in @xmath61 are known , including time reversal @xcite and series expansion methods @xcite .",
    "hence in such situations theorem  [ thm : factorization ] yields efficient reconstruction algorithms .",
    "further , explicit formulas for inverting @xmath59 are known for some particular surfaces @xmath1 , including spheres @xcite and ellipsoids @xcite .",
    "combining inversion formulas for @xmath58 and @xmath59 gives us explicit formulas for recovering a function from its spherical radon transform on elliptical cylinders . in the following section we derive such formulas for elliptical cylinders",
    "in this section we consider the case where @xmath62 is the boundary of the solid ellipsoid @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a diagonal @xmath65 matrix with positive diagonal entries @xmath66 .",

    "in such a situation @xmath69 can be defined via extension to the space of temperate distributions ; see @xcite for details .",

    "theorem [ thm : factorization ] in combination with the inversion formulas for the spherical radon transform on a planar center - set and an elliptical center - set @xmath77 yields explicit inversion formulas for @xmath22 .",

    "consequently , in such a situation , the inversion formula is local : recovering the function @xmath18 at any point @xmath90 uses only integrals over those spheres which pass through an arbitrarily small neighborhood of that point . in the case",

    "we thereby use approximately five times more data points than unknowns , which mainly accounts for the fact that the detector elements cover a larger area than the reconstruction volume ; while the step sizes are the same . reducing the number of data points would introduce artifacts due to spatial undersampling ; see  @xcite .",
