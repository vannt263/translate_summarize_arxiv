    "we find that the lund - regge metric can be degenerate , change signature , and have more than one physical time - like directions .",
    "we conclude with a comparison with known continuum results .",
    "in this section we shall briefly review some of the known properties of the metric on the superspace of continuum geometries on a fixed three - manifold @xmath8 .",
    "we do this to highlight the main features that we must address when analyzing the corresponding metric on the superspace of simplicial geometries .",
    "a more detailed account of the continuum situation can be readily found @xcite .",
    "geometries on @xmath8 can be represented by three - metrics @xmath9 , although , of course , different metrics describe the same geometry when related by a diffeomorphism .",
    "we denote the space of three - metrics on @xmath8 by @xmath10 .",
    "a point in @xmath11 is a particular metric @xmath9 and we may consider the tangent space of vectors at a point .",
    "infinitesimal displacements @xmath12 from one three - metric to another are particular examples of vectors .",
    "we denote such vectors generally by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , etc .",
    "a natural class of metrics on @xmath10 emerges from the structure of the constraints of general relativity .",
    "explicitly they are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , called the inverse dewitt supermetric , is given by @xmath17 \\label{twotwo}\\ ] ] and @xmath18 is an essentially arbitrary but non - vanishing function called the lapse .",
    "different metrics result from different choices of @xmath18 . in the following",
    "we shall confine ourselves to the simplest choice , @xmath19 .",
    "the dewitt supermetric ( [ twotwo ] ) at a point @xmath20 defines a metric on the six - dimensional space of three - metric components at @xmath20",
    ". this metric has signature @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the signature of the metric ( [ twoone ] ) on @xmath11 therefore has an infinite number of negative signs and an infinite number of positive signs  roughly one negative sign and five positive signs for each point in @xmath8 .",
    "the space of interest , however , is not the space of three - metrics @xmath10 but rather the superspace of three - geometries riem@xmath22 whose `` points '' consist of classes of diffeomorphically equivalent metrics , @xmath9 .",
    "a metric on riem@xmath22 can be induced from the metric on @xmath10 , ( [ twoone ] ) , by choosing a particular perturbation in the metric @xmath12 to represent the infinitesimal displacement between two nearby three - geometries . however , a @xmath23 is not fixed uniquely by the pair of nearby geometries .",
    "rather , as is well known , there is an arbitrariness in @xmath12 corresponding to the arbitrariness in how the points in the two geometries are identified .",
    "that arbitrariness means that , for any vector @xmath24 , the `` gauge - transformed '' perturbation @xmath25 represents the same displacement in superspace as @xmath12 does , where @xmath26 is the derivative in @xmath8 .",
    "the metric ( [ twoone ] ) on @xmath10 is not invariant under gauge transformations of the form ( [ twothree ] ) even with @xmath27 .",
    "thus we may distinguish `` _ vertical _ '' directions in @xmath10 which are pure gauge @xmath28 and `` _ horizontal _ '' directions which are orthogonal to _ all _ of these in the metric ( [ twoone ] ) .",
    "since the metric ( [ twoone ] ) is not invariant under gauge transformations , there are different notions of distance between points in superspace depending on what @xmath12 is used to represent displacements between them .",
    "the conventional choice @xcite for defining a geometry on superspace has been to choose the _ minimum _ of such distances between points .",
    "that is the same as saying that distance is measured in `` horizontal '' directions in superspace .",
    "equivalently , one could say that a gauge for representing displacements has been fixed .",
    "it is the gauge specified by the three conditions @xmath29    the signature of the metric defined by the above construction is an obvious first question concerning the geometry of superspace .",
    "the infinite dimensionality of superspace , however , makes this a non - trivial question to answer .",
    "the known results have been lucidly explained by friedman and higuchi @xcite and giulini @xcite and we briefly summarize some of them here :    * at any point in superspace there is always at least one negative direction represented by constant conformal displacements of the form @xmath30 evidently ( [ twosix ] ) satisfies ( [ twofive ] ) so that it is horizontal , and explicit computation from ( [ twoone ] ) shows @xmath31 ; * if @xmath8 is the sphere @xmath2 , then for a neighborhood of the round metric on @xmath2 , the signature has one negative sign corresponding to ( [ twosix ] ) and all other orthogonal directions are positive ; * every @xmath8 admits geometries with negative ricci curvature ( all eigenvalues strictly negative ) . in the open region of superspace defined by negative ricci curvature geometries",
    "the signature has an _ infinite _ number of negative signs and an _ infinite _ number of positive signs . on the sphere",
    ", these results already show that there must be points in superspace where the metric is degenerate .",
    "the above results are limited , covering only a small part of the totality of superspace . in the following",
    "we shall show that more complete results can be obtained in simplicial configuration space .",
    "in this section we derive the form of the lund - regge metric on simplicial configuration space together with some analytic results on its signature .",
    "we consider a fixed closed simplicial three - manifold @xmath8 consisting of @xmath32 tetrahedra ( three - simplices ) joined together so that each neighborhood of a point in @xmath8 is homeomorphic to a region of @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting collections of @xmath34 @xmath35-simplices , ( vertices , edges , triangles , and tetrahedra for @xmath36 , respectively ) we denote by @xmath37 .",
    "a simplicial geometry is fixed by an assignment of values to the squared edge - lengths of @xmath38 and a flat riemannian geometry to the interior of each tetrahedron consistent with those values .",
    "the assignment of squared edge - lengths is not arbitrary .",
    "the squared edge - lengths are positive and constrained by the triangle inequalities and their analogs for the tetrahedra .",
    "specifically if @xmath39 is the squared measure ( length , area , volume ) of @xmath35-simplex @xmath40 expressed as a function of the @xmath41 , we must have @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "the space of three - geometries on @xmath8 is therefore the subset of the space of @xmath4 squared edge - lengths @xmath41 in which ( [ threeone ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we call this _ simplicial configuration space _ and denote it by @xmath44 . a point in @xmath45",
    "is a geometry on @xmath8 ; the @xmath46 are coordinates locating points in @xmath44 .",
    "distinct points in @xmath44 correspond to different assignments of edge - lengths to the simplicial manifold @xmath8 . in general distinct points",
    "correspond to distinct three - geometries and , in this respect , @xmath44 is like a superspace of three - geometries .",
    "however , this is not always the case .",
    "displacements of the vertices of a flat geometry in a flat embedding space result in a new assignment of the edge - lengths that corresponds to the same flat geometry .",
    "these variations in edge - lengths that preserve geometry are the simplicial analogs of diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "further , for large triangulations where the local geometry is near to flat we expect there to be approximate simplicial diffeomorphisms  small changes in the edge - lengths which approximately preserve the geometry @xcite .",
    "thus , the continuum limit of @xmath44 is not the superspace of three - geometries but the space of three - metrics .",
    "it is for these reasons that we have used the term simplicial configuration space rather than simplicial superspace .",
    "we now define a metric on @xmath44 that gives the distance between points separated by infinitesimal displacements @xmath47 according to @xmath48 such a metric can be induced from the dewitt metric on the space @xmath10 of continuum three - metrics on @xmath8 in the following way :    every simplicial geometry can be represented in @xmath10 by a metric which is piecewise flat in the tetrahedra and , indeed , there are many different metrics representing the same geometry .",
    "every displacement @xmath47 between two nearly three - geometries can be represented by a perturbation @xmath12 of the metric in @xmath49 .",
    "the dewitt metric ( [ twoone ] ) which gives the notion of distance between nearby metrics in @xmath10 can therefore be used to induce a notion of distance in @xmath44 through the relation @xmath50 on the right hand side @xmath16 is ( [ twotwo ] ) evaluated at a piecewise flat metric representing the simplicial geometry and @xmath51 is a perturbation in the metric representing the change in that geometry corresponding to the displacement @xmath47 .    however , as the discussion of section ii should make clear , many different metrics on @xmath44 can be induced by the identification ( [ threethree ] ) . first , there is the choice of @xmath18 .",
    "we choose @xmath19 .",
    "second , since the right hand side of ( [ threethree ] ) is not gauge invariant we must fix a gauge for the perturbations @xmath23 to determine a metric @xmath52 .",
    "there are two parts to this .",
    "first , to evaluate the integral on the right hand side of ( [ threethree ] ) we must at least fix the gauge _ inside _ each tetrahedron .",
    "we shall refer to this as the _ regge gauge _ freedom .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that any choice for the regge gauge does not completely fix the total gauge freedom available .",
    "as discussed above , there still may be variations of the lengths of the edges which preserve the geometry ",
    "simplicial diffeomorphisms  and correspondingly @xmath53 can still have both vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "therefore , secondly , this gauge freedom must also be fixed .",
    "a natural choice for the regge gauge from the point of view of simplicial geometry is to require that the @xmath23 are _ constant _ inside each tetrahedron , @xmath54 but possibly varying from one tetrahedron to the next .",
    "the conditions ( [ threefour ] ) are , of course , more numerous than the three diffeomorphism conditions permitted at each point , but as we already mentioned , these two gauges are distinct .",
    "thus , ( [ threefour ] ) is not the regge calculus counterpart of ( [ twofive ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , this choice of regge - gauge ( [ threefour ] ) has a beautiful property which we shall discuss below in subsection b.    assuming ( [ threefour ] ) , the right hand side of ( [ threethree ] ) may be evaluated explicitly .",
    "although not gauge invariant , the right - hand - side of ( [ threethree ] ) _ is _ coordinate invariant .",
    "we may therefore conveniently use coordinates in which the metric coefficients @xmath9 satisfying ( [ threefour ] ) are constant in each tetrahedron .",

    "one way of making an explicit identification is to pick a particular vertex in each tetrahedron @xmath63 and consider the vectors @xmath64 proceeding from this vertex to the other three vertices @xmath65 along the edges of the tetrahedron .",

    "such a term must be included since we do not necessarily assume that the non - gauge invariant argument of ( [ threefifteen ] ) is continuous from tetrahedron to tetrahedron . the conditions ( [ threefour ] )",
    "make the first term vanish .",
    "the second vanishes when @xmath24 vanishes on the boundary of every tetrahedron .",
    "that means that the distance defined by the lund - regge metric is an extremum among all re - identifications of points in the _ interiors _ of the tetrahedra between the perturbed and unperturbed geometries .",
    "it does not appear to necessarily be an extremum with respect to re - identifying points in the interior of triangles or edges .",
    "the lund - regge metric therefore provides the shortest distance between simplicial three - metrics among all choices of regge gauge which vanish on the triangles .",

    "if all the edge lengths are assigned symmetrically  all equal edge - lengths in the present case  then the eigenvalues may be classified according to the irreducible representations of @xmath156 and their degeneracies are given by the dimensions of those representations .",
    "this is because a permutation of the vertices can be viewed as a matrix in the 10-dimensional space of edges which interchanges the edges in accordance with the permutation of the vertices .",
    "the regge - lund metric @xmath85 may be viewed similarly and commutes with all the elements of @xmath156 for a symmetric assignment of edges .",
    "the matrices representing the elements of @xmath156 give a 10-dimensional reducible representation of it , which can be decomposed into irreducible representations by standard methods described in @xcite .",
    "the result is that the reducible representation decomposes as @xmath157 , where the factors in this sum are dimensions of the irreducible representations , which we expect to be the multiplicities of the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath85 at a symmetric assignment of edges .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of the eigenvalues are illustrated in figure  2 for a slice of simplicial configuration space .",
    "when all the edges are equal to 1 we found one eigenvalue of @xmath158 , four eigenvalues equal to @xmath159 , and five of @xmath160 .",
    "as expected , these degeneracies were broken when we departed from the spherical geometry ( figure  2 ) . nevertheless , even with aspect ratios on the order of @xmath161 we always found a single timelike direction in this simplicial superspace .",
    "= 5.0truein    [ fig2 ]",
    "in this section we analyze the lund - regge metric in the neighborhood of two different flat geometries on a common class of triangulations of the three - torus , @xmath3 .",
    "we investigate the metric on triangulations of varying refinement in this class .",
    "we illustrate degeneracy of the metric and identify a few gauge modes ( vertical directions ) in flat space which correspond to positive eigenvalues .",
    "the class of triangulations of @xmath3 is constructed as follows : a lattice of cubes , with @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 cubes in the @xmath20 , @xmath165 and @xmath166-directions , is given the topology of a 3-torus by identifying opposite faces in each of the three directions .",
    "each cube is divided into six tetrahedra , by drawing in face diagonals and a body diagonal ( for details , see rcek and williams@xcite ) .",
    "the number of vertices is then @xmath167 and there are @xmath168 edges , @xmath169 triangles , and @xmath170 tetrahedra .",
    "the geometry is flat when the squared edge lengths of the sides , face diagonals , and body diagonals take values of 1 , 2 , and 3 times the lattice scale respectively .",
    "we refer to this geometry as the _ right - tetrahedron lattice_.    the flat 3-torus can also be tessellated by isosceles tetrahedra , each face of which is an isosceles triangle with a squared base edge of @xmath171 , the other two squared edge - lengths being @xmath172 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ isosceles - tetrahedron lattice_. one can obtain this lattice from the right - tetrahedron lattice by the following construction on each cube . compress the cube along its main diagonal in a symmetrical way , keeping all the  coordinate edges \" at length @xmath171 , until the main diagonal is also of length @xmath171 .",
    "the face diagonals will then have squared edge - lengths of @xmath173 .",
    "an overall rescaling by a factor of @xmath174 then converts the lattice of these deformed cubes to the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice .",
    "these two lattices correspond to distinct points in the @xmath168 dimensional simplicial configuration space of a triangulation of @xmath3 .",
    "they are examples of inequivalent flat geometries on @xmath3 .",
    "even though they can be obtained from each other by the deformation procedure described , they are associated with distinct flat structures .",
    "for example , consider the geodesic structure . for the right - tetrahedron lattice , there are three orthogonal geodesics of extremal length at any point , parallel to the coordinate edges of the cubes of which the lattice is constructed , and corresponding to the different meridians of the torus . on the other hand , for the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice",
    ", the three extremal geodesics at any point will not be orthogonal to each other ; they will actually be parallel to the  coordinate edges \" which in the deformation process have moved into positions at angles of @xmath175 to each other .",
    "( it is perhaps easier to visualize the analogous situation in two dimensions where the geodesics will be at angles of @xmath176 to each other ) .",
    "if the metric structures on the two lattices we consider were diffeomorphically equivalent , the diffeomorphism would preserve geometric quantities , like the angles between the extremal - length geodesics , and this is clearly not the case .",
    "we shall see how this inequivalence between the flat tori manifests itself in the simplicial supermetric .",
    "we first turn to a detailed examination of the the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice and , in particular , the eigenvalues of the lund - regge metric . unlike the relatively simple @xmath2 model described above where we used mathematica to calculate the eigenvalue spectrum of the matrix @xmath85 , here we developed a c program utilizing a householder method to determine the the eigenvalue spectrum and corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "in addition , we calculated the deficit angle ( integrated curvature ) associated to each edge .",
    "these deficit angles were used to identify diffeomorphism and conformal directions as well as to corroborate the analytic results for the continuum described in the introduction .",
    "we performed various runs ranging from an isosceles - tetrahedron lattice with @xmath177 vertices and 189 edges , up to a lattice with @xmath178 vertices and 1764 edges .",
    "the points ( simplicial 3-geometries ) in such high dimensional simplicial configuration spaces can not be systematically canvassed as we did in the 4-simplex model .",
    "for this reason we chose to search the neighborhood of flat space in two ways .",
    "first we explored the region around flat space by making random variations ( up to 20 percent ) in the squared edge - lengths of the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice , and secondly we perturbed the edge - lengths a short distance along selected flat - space eigenvectors .",
    "movement along the eigenvectors was performed in the following way .",
    "we start with a set of squared edge - lengths corresponding to zero curvature .",
    "all the @xmath168 deficit angles are zero .",
    "we calculate the @xmath168 eigenvectors , @xmath179 together with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath180 and then adjust the squared edge - lengths along one of the @xmath181 as specified in : @xmath182 here we choose @xmath183 .",
    "we then calculate the deficit angles for this new point @xmath184 and then repeat this procedure for each @xmath181 in turn . in this way we can in principle identify which ( if any ) of the eigenvectors correspond to gauge directions .",
    "we observe the following :    * eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath185 appear to be diffeomorphisms to order @xmath186 in the sense that the deficit angles are of order @xmath186 . * for an @xmath187 lattice there are @xmath188 eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath185 .",
    "* there are @xmath189 eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath190 .",
    "a graphical representation of this movement along the eigenvectors away from the flat isosceles - tetrahedron lattice point is illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "= 5.0truein    [ fig3 ]    although the eigenvalues corresponding to those gauge directions we have identified is positive , we have not been able to establish all gauge directions are spacelike . for the right - tetrahedron lattice",
    "we have simplified the expression ( [ threethirty ] ) obtained for diffeomorphism modes as follows .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath56 with respect to the diagonal edges all vanish , so that only the edges of the cubic lattice need be included in the @xmath119 sum . for lattice spacing of 1",
    ", these derivatives are all @xmath191 , giving @xmath192 , since each such edge is shared by 6 tetrahedra .",
    "thus for this lattice we have @xmath193 ^ 2   \\label{fourthree}\\ ] ] where @xmath194 implies that @xmath195 and @xmath196 are connected by an edge .",
    "alternatively , in terms of summation over edges , @xmath197 , the expression is @xmath198 \\label{fourfour}\\ ] ]    even though ( [ fourfour ] ) is relatively simple , with definite signs for each term , we have not managed to prove a general result about the overall sign .",
    "we suspect that it is positive and in the following special cases have found this to be true :    1 .",
    "if just one vertex moves through @xmath199 @xmath200 2 .",
    "if only the edges in one coordinate direction of the lattice change , @xmath201 3 .",
    "if all the @xmath202 s have the same magnitude @xmath203 ( but not the same direction ) @xmath204 since @xmath205    if it could be proved that @xmath107 is always positive , it would still remain to calculate the number of independent directions in the space of edge - lengths , in order to see how many of the positive eigenvalues do indeed correspond to vertical gauge modes .",
    "we next turn briefly to more general aspects of the right - tetrahedron lattice . as mentioned earlier , although the geometry of the right - tetrahedron is flat like the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice , it is not diffeomorphic to it .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that when we calculate the eigenvalues of the lund - regge metric we find both their values and degeneracies to differ from the isosceles - tetrahedron case . even if the lattices are rescaled so that their total volumes are equal , the eigenvalue spectra ( which scale by the inverse length ) are still not the same .",
    "the right - tetrahedron case presents allows a particularly easy analysis of how the degeneracies of the eigenvalue spectrum are connected with the symmetry group of a lattice . to find the symmetry group of the right - tetrahedron lattice , consider the symmetries when one point , the origin say , is fixed .",
    "these are a  parity \" transformation ( when @xmath206 is mapped to @xmath207 ) , represented by @xmath208 , and a permutation of the three coordinate directions , represented by @xmath209 .",
    "the full group is obtained by combining this @xmath210 subgroup with the subgroup of translations ( mod 3 ) in the three coordinate directions .",
    "thus the symmetry group of the @xmath3 lattice with @xmath177 vertices is the semi - direct product of the elementary abelian normal subgroup of order @xmath211 by the subgroup @xmath210 .",
    "the action of the group on the vertices induces a permutation of the edges .",
    "this 189-dimensional permutation representation of the edges decomposes as @xmath212 where _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath213 is the third irreducible representation of dimension @xmath214 .",
    "when this is compared with the multiplicities found for the eigenvalues of the supermetric for the flat - space decomposition with right - angled tetrahedra , it can be seen that the numbers agree precisely provided that the two multiplicities of @xmath215 are interpreted as @xmath216 , and the two multiplicities of @xmath217 are regarded as @xmath218 .",
    "we have no explanation for this unexpected degeneracy , although it has been observed before ( for example for several triangulations of @xmath219 @xcite ) and we suspect that there is a deep group theoretical reason for it .",
    "a detailed investigation of the eigenvalues found for the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice would almost certainly reveal similar accidental degeneracies , for example for the multiplicity of 29 found numerically for the eigenvalue @xmath190 .",
    "finally we look at common properties of the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice and right tetrahedron lattice , in particular , the the signature of the lund - regge metric , which is the main point of these calculations .",
    "for both the isosceles- and right - tetrahedron lattices with @xmath177 vertices , and therefore 189 edges , the supermetric ( in a flat - space configuration , and in a neighborhood of flat space ) has 176 positive eigenvalues and 13 negative ones ( fig .",
    "4 illustrates these results for the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice , together with the other 32 runs we made ) .",
    "these are consistent with our analytical results and can be interpreted as follows .",
    "* there are rather more than the required @xmath220 spacelike directions . *",
    "the negative eigenvalues include the conformal mode .",
    "* we have shown that the eigenvalues corresponding to diffeomorphisms may sometimes be positive , and for the isosceles - tetrahedron lattice have identified each of the eigenvectors corresponding to the @xmath185 eigenvalue as a generator of a diffeomorphism , or vertical direction . *",
    "none of the eigenvectors corresponding to the @xmath221 negative eigenvalues are generators of diffeomorphisms .",
    "this indicates that there are @xmath221 horizontal directions corresponding to negative eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , we consistently observe signature change in the supermetric as we depart from the flat space point .",
    "we also observed a few null eigenvalues for the right - tetrahedron lattice for flat space at various resolutions , including @xmath222 .",
    "we are presumably seeing finite analogs of the infinite number of horizontal ( i.e. non - gauge ) directions predicted by giulini @xcite for regions of superspace in the neighborhood of a flat metric , where there is an open region with negative ricci curvature .",
    "this illustrates the important fact that there are still timelike directions in the simplicial supermetric , beyond the conformal mode , which are always present .    .26 in    = 5.0truein    [ fig4 ]",
    "in this paper we used the simplicial supermetric of lund and regge as a tool for analyzing the geometry of simplicial configuration space , specifically the signature of the lund - regge metric .",
    "one way of summarizing our results is to compare them with the known results for the metric on continuum superspace described in the introduction :    the conformal direction ( [ threeseventeen ] ) is timelike as we showed analytically in ( [ threenineteen ] ) .",
    "this coincides with the result for the continuum conformal displacements .",
    "the simplest simplicial manifold with the topology of the three - sphere ( @xmath2 ) is the surface of a four - simplex . here",
    ", we showed that , in the 10-dimensional simplicial configuration space , among a set of orthogonal directions there is always a single timelike direction and nine spacelike ones , even for regions of simplicial configuration space corresponding to geometries distorted from spherical symmetry with aspect ratios exceeding @xmath161 in squared edge - length .",
    "for the continuum such a result is known only in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the round metric ( analogous to all equal edges ) .",
    "however , we have no evidence that the situation of a single timelike direction in an orthogonal set extends to more refined triangulations of @xmath2 such as the 600-cell .",
    "in particular , preliminary results indicate that there are 628 positive , 92 negative and no zero eigenvalues for the 600-cell model@xcite .    by investigating a neighborhood of the flat geometry in various triangulations of @xmath3 , we exhibited exact simplicial diffeomorphisms for exactly flat geometries , and approximate simplicial diffeomorphisms for approximately flat assignments of the squared edge lengths .",
    "we showed that that there was more than one orthogonal timelike non - gauge direction at the flat geometry .",
    "we showed that the lund - regge metric can become degenerate and change signature as one moves away from exactly flat geometries  a result that might have been expected at least on large triangulations of @xmath2 from the combination of the continuum results on the signature near a round metric and the different signature on regions that correspond to negative curvature . here",
    ", signature change is exhibited explicitly for @xmath3 .",
    "the principle advantage of casting the dewitt supermetric into its simplicial form is to reduce the continuum infinite dimensional superspace to a finite dimensional simplicial configuration space .",
    "this simplicial configuration space is to be contrasted with `` mini- '' or `` midi''-superspaces .",
    "simplicial configuration space preserves elements of _ both _ the physical degrees of freedom and the diffeomorphisms . in the continuum limit of increasingly large triangulations",
    "we expect to recover the full content of both .",
    "our analysis provides motivation for further research .",
    "a potentially fruitful line of investigation is to define approximate notions of vertical and horizontal directions in simplicial configuration space in such a way that they coincide with the exact vertical and horizontal directions in the continuum limit .",
    "we already know that there are @xmath106 approximate diffeomorphism degrees of freedom for a simplicial 3-geometry  a fact that has been demonstrated analytically and illustrated numerically in regge geometrodynamics via the freedom of choice of a shift vector per vertex@xcite .",
    "once armed with such a theory of approximate simplicial diffeomorphisms , it would be interesting to extend our @xmath2 analysis to a simplicial model with arbitrarily large number of vertices . in this way we can be assured that the tessellation will have encoded in it all of the true dynamic degrees of freedom as well as the full diffeomorphism freedom .",
