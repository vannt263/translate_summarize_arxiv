    "the spiral arrangements appear in very different systems of condense matter physics and biology @xcite providing an important example of a primitive self - organization . sometimes this self - organization results in rather intricate structures ( may be the first staircases to more complicated biological patterns ) like the blue phases in chiral liquid crystals @xcite or the skyrmion textures in chiral magnetics with @xmath8 crystal structure ( mnsi , mnge , fe@xmath9co@xmath10si ) @xcite .",
    "there is a remarkable similarity in the physics of those so different systems @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting and challenging to look for local interactions responsible for macroscopic spiral ordering and , in particular , to find relationships between parameters of the local interaction and the final structures .",
    "for instance , the first question is what determines the period and handedness of helices ?",
    "most frequently , the helical arrangements are described phenomenologically , just by adding chiral terms like @xmath11 to the free energy of the system where vector @xmath12 describes a local system anisotropy .",
    "the period and handedness of helices are determined by the absolute value and sign of the pseudoscalar coefficient @xmath13 ; of course this term should be allowed by the system symmetry ( lack of inversion is required ) . in the chiral liquid crystals ,",
    "the value of @xmath13 is believed to be determined by steric interactions between neighboring chiral molecules but any quantitative theory is still absent because of baffling complexity of the problem . in cubic magnetic crystals of the mnsi type , the helical",
    "ordering is induced by the dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya ( dm ) interaction between neighboring magnetic moments @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this interaction @xcite can exist both in centrosymmetric and non - centrosymmetric crystals but only in the latter case it results in long - range helical structures .",
    "the most simple form of the dm term in the interaction energy is written as @xmath16 $ ] where pseudovector coupling coefficients @xmath17 originate from superexchange interaction via neighboring atoms .",
    "it was shown by moriya that vectors @xmath17 are determined by asymmetry of local atomic arrangements .",
    "recently it was carefully investigated , using synchrotron radiation and polarized neutron small - angle diffraction , what is the relationship between the handedness of the mnsi crystal structure and the sign of magnetic helix @xcite .",
    "it was unequivocally demonstrated that the structural chirality rigorously determines the magnetic chirality of these compounds .",
    "the interplay between structural chirality is also important for spin chirality in multilayer structures @xcite .",
    "however , no analytical formula related @xmath13 and @xmath17 has been found yet even for the simple case of interaction between magnetic moments of neighboring atoms .",
    "this problem is indeed even more complicated because the itinerant nature of magnetism in mnsi crystals .",
    "detailed numerical studies of the dm interaction in mnsi - type crystals are performed by hopkinson and kee @xcite and their results will be discussed below in comparison with the results of the present paper .",
    "a generic feature , intrinsic to complicated spacial structures , is _ frustration _ of their local ordering : the configurations with the best local energy can not be spread for all the system . in the chiral liquid crystals and mnsi heliomagnetics ,",
    "the most favorable double - twist local arrangements are restricted by topological constrains existing in two - dimensional and three - dimensional spaces @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , the stable three - dimensional blue phases are possible in a narrow range of temperatures whereas the two - dimensional system of spin vertices can be stabilized by external magnetic field .",
    "however , in complicated crystals like la@xmath18cuo@xmath19 , there is an additional mechanism of frustrations @xcite related with different orientations of @xmath17 for different inter - spin bonds .",
    "we have found that this type of frustration is also intrinsic to the mnsi structure : at the atomic scale , spin rotation in the magnetic helices can be strongly nonmonotonic because of different orientations of @xmath17 for different bonds . as a result",
    ", unequal righthand and lefthand twists usually coexist in each of the helices .",
    "for instance , the coefficient @xmath13 can become zero even for nonzero @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we first find a simple analytical expression related the helix period and handedness with the dm vectors of the shortest mn - mn bonds . in this consideration ,",
    "we adopt a usually used approximation that the exchange interaction is stronger than dm interaction and twist angles between neighboring atoms are correspondingly small .",
    "it is demonstrated that for general orientation of dm vectors the mnsi helical structure is frustrated so that the twist angles between neighboring ferromagnetic layers have different signs .",
    "then , using the same approximations , conical distortions of helices in external magnetic fields are analyzed and the critical field of helix unwinding is determined .",
    "finally , the parameters of the known phenomenological description of mnsi helices are related to the dm vectors of the microscopic theory .",
    "in a simple model of classical heisenberg ferromagnetics with an extra interaction of the dzyaloshinskii  moriya ( dm ) type , the energy of the system is expressed as a sum of pair interactions between magnetic atoms and the interaction of individual atoms with an external magnetic field @xmath20 : @xmath21 ) - g\\mu_b \\sum_i \\mathbf{h } \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_i , \\ ] ] where the first summation is taken over all pairs @xmath22 of magnetic atoms , @xmath23 is the exchange interaction constant , @xmath17 are the dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya vectors , and @xmath24 is an effective magnetic moment . hereafter we will use the approximation of classical spins with ferromagnetic exchange coupling between nearest neighbors , @xmath25 , and suppose that @xmath26 for all magnetic atoms . using the nearest neighbor approximation for the mnsi - type crystals we can rewrite eq .",

    "it should be emphasized that vectors @xmath17 have different orientations for different bonds and relations between different @xmath17 can be found from symmetry reasons . in the unit cell of mnsi - type crystals ,",
    "the magnetic atoms are at the @xmath30 positions with coordinates @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "there are 24 crystallographically equivalent bonds between nearest neighbors , and dm vectors for all bonds can be obtained from dm vector of any bond using symmetry transformations of the point group @xmath35 of mnsi crystal augmented with the inversion ; the latter appears owing to the permutation of atoms : @xmath36 .",
    "the procedure is , in principle , very simple : we choose an arbitrary vector @xmath37 as dm vector of the `` first '' bond , say @xmath38 , connecting mn atom at @xmath31 with mn atom at @xmath39 .",
    "it should be an arbitrary vector because no symmetry operation is associated with the bond .",
    "then , for this cubic space group , any shortest bond between mn atoms can be obtained from the `` first '' one using cyclic permutations ( i.e. threefold rotations ) and/or sign inversions ( i.e. twofold rotations and inversions ) of its vector components .",
    "the components of the corresponding dm vector are expressed through @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 by exactly the same cyclic permutations and/or sign inversions .",
    "the list of all the bonds and their @xmath43-vectors is given in table [ tabled ] .",
    "all @xmath17 have the same length : @xmath44 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the dm term should be accompanied by two extra terms : @xmath45 these terms are of the same order of magnitude as the dm term because for small dm interaction , @xmath46 , small angles between @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of order @xmath47 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energys ] ) , with the same accuracy we can put @xmath48 for a small domain containing all 12 different interatomic bonds and averaging of @xmath49 over these 12 bonds gives @xmath50 .",
    "( [ eq : energys ] ) can be written as @xmath51 this term is isotropic and can be included into exchange term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy1 ] ) .",
    "we see that in cubic crystals the extra terms given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energys ] ) are not important if @xmath46 .",
    "having a list of dm vectors one can calculate and minimize numerically the magnetic energies ( [ eq : energy1 ] ) and ( [ eq : energy2 ] ) for rather big sets of atoms with distinct moment configurations , including those similar to skyrmions",
    ". however in this paper we will use only analytic calculations for detailed consideration of helical structures .",
    "let us start with the simple case of free helices which provides a minimum of the magnetic energies ( [ eq : energy1 ] ) and ( [ eq : energy2 ] ) for @xmath52 . as it is known from numerous experiments , well below the curie point the magnetic moments of mn atoms form a simple helix .",
    "however , in the general case , the helices may be different for four different types of equivalent atomic positions in the unit cell ( i.e. for positions with four different orientations of the local threefold axes ) , and this is confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "then , the spin structure can be described by the superposition of four helices @xmath53 so that the condition @xmath54 is obviously obeyed . here",
    "@xmath55 is an atomic position , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are perpendicular unit vectors , @xmath2 is a wave vector .",
    "upper index @xmath58 enumerates four atomic positions in the `` first '' unit cell : @xmath31 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , correspondingly .",
    "we express all the atomic positions in the units of the cubic unit cell so that both @xmath55 and @xmath2 vectors are dimensionless .",
    "notice that all four spirals given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) have the same wave vector whereas in the skyrmion - like structures there is a set of different wave vectors .",
    "it can be easily seen that the spins of sublattice @xmath62 rotate in the plane perpendicular to vector @xmath63 , \\ ] ] whose direction generally speaking can differ from that of wave vector @xmath2 .",

    "it should be noted here that dependence on atomic positions is present in these trigonometric functions only .",
    "after summation over all unit cells of the crystal all the functions of argument @xmath67 vanish because @xmath2 is not a reciprocal lattice vector , whereas the functions of argument @xmath68 do not depend on the unit cells to which @xmath28-th and @xmath29-th atoms belong .",

    "it depends on 15 variables only : three angles characterizing orientation of triad @xmath74 for each of four mn sublattices , and three components of the wave vector @xmath2 .",
    "the exchange interaction constant @xmath4 , dm vectors @xmath17 and distances @xmath69 between neighboring atoms are supposed to be invariable ; we do not consider phenomena ( e.g. magnetostriction ) changing these parameters .",
    "below , instead of numerical minimization , we will look for approximate analytical solutions relying on a small parameter .",
    "indeed , it is known from the experimental data that the spin - orbit interaction is usually much smaller than the exchange one , so that @xmath46 . in the mnsi crystal , strong exchange interaction leads to the ferromagnetic ordering , whereas small dm interaction results in small canting of neighboring magnetic moments .",
    "small values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( the latter is supposed to be of the order of @xmath75 ) allows us to perform approximate minimization of the energy .",
    "in particular , we can take advantage of the fact , that in this approximation the triads @xmath77 have close orientations for four mn sublattices .",

    "for instance , if one chooses @xmath275 in the form of @xmath292 then @xmath293 has the form ( [ eq : s3 ] ) .",
    "as it is shown above , in the approximation linear on @xmath180 , only two components of dm vectors are significant for the considered magnetic structure of mnsi : @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "the third component , @xmath7 , appears in upper approximations .",
    "the pseudo - scalar constant @xmath296 used in the phenomenological theory is found to be proportional to the first component , @xmath294 .",
    "in fact , we could expect that only this combination of @xmath43-vector coordinates played a role in the simplest microscopic approximation .",
    "surprisingly , it has been found that another component , @xmath295 , is also very important both because of its contribution into magnetic energy and its influence on spins orientations .",
    "this effect is very similar to `` frozen '' optical phonon displacements of atoms in crystals .",
    "whereas the former component is responsible for the long scale chiral magnetic structure , the latter leads to a canting of spins within a unit cell and this canting could be in principle measured experimentally using diffraction methods @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the magnetic fields stronger than @xmath191 , the residual splay of spins results in non - zero value of the neutron scattering amplitude for reflections of @xmath297 type , forbidden both for nuclear scattering and for ferromagnetic scattering owing to @xmath168 screw axes .",
    "an interesting result about the symmetry of the problem can be revealed considering the inverse structure , where magnetic atoms occupy positions @xmath298 rather than @xmath299 .",
    "the crystal thus obtained has the same space group , @xmath1 , but both the crystals are related as right- and left - hand structures , via the inversion transformation .",
    "it can be easily seen from the expression ( [ eq : energy1 ] ) that energy does not change over this transformation , if the spins in corresponding positions are equal and so do dzyaloshinskii ",
    "moriya vectors associated with corresponding bonds .",
    "this means that dm vectors are really pseudovectors .",
    "also it is well understood @xcite that the inversion should change the chirality of the structure and , consequently , the sign of phenomenological constant @xmath271 and wave number @xmath5 .",
    "however it is not so evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : k3 ] ) that @xmath5 changes its sign over inversion , because @xmath43 is a pseudovector rather than a vector .",
    "we should rewrite the wave number in an invariant form , including an explicit dependence on the bond direction , in order to make transparent the change of chirality upon inversion : @xmath300 the pseudovector @xmath301 does not change its sign under inversion but @xmath302 does .",
    "notice that in this form the sign of @xmath5 does not depend on our choice which of atoms is 1 or 2 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with those ones obtained by hopkinson and kee @xcite using mean - field and real - space rigid rotor minimization methods . according to this work , for both methods",
    ", a sizable spin helicity can be obtained only when the dm vectors lie _ parallel _ to the corresponding mn - mn bonds .",
    "correspondingly , three components of dm vector are considered : the first one , parallel to the bond , the second one , perpendicular to the triangle of bonds , to which this bond is belonging , and the third one , lying in the plane of the triangle , but perpendicular to the bond .",
    "for instance , for the bond @xmath303 these three directions can be written in explicit form as @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath306 , correspondingly , or , using @xmath307 , as @xmath308 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "the first component is responsible for the helix structure , and corresponding direction , @xmath308 , is very close to direction @xmath311 for @xmath294 component found in our work ( the angle between them is about 3.4 degrees ) .",
    "the second component , which does not ca nt spins @xcite , coincides with our `` neutral '' component @xmath7 directed along the corresponding 3-fold axis .",
    "the third component leads to spin canting and rather small spin spiraling , and its direction , @xmath312 , is very close to direction @xmath313 for @xmath295 component .",
    "obviously , those numerical results almost coincide with our analytical solutions .",
    "an advantage of the analytical solution is that it does not rely on the exact bond directions and atomic coordinates ; that is natural from the theoretical point of view because the atomic parameter @xmath114 does not figure in eq .",
    "[ eq : energy1 ] .",
    "moreover , different model considerations predict that the superexchange dm vectors are either perpendicular @xcite or almost perpendicular @xcite to the corresponding bonds .",
    "if this is also the case in mnsi , we could expect pronounced frustration of the helices . in any case , it is obvious that modern _ ab initio _ calculations of the dyzaloshinskii - moriya vectors would be very important for mnsi - type crystals .    in conclusion ,",
    "it is found which component of the dyzaloshinskii - moriya vector determines the long - range spiral ordering .",
    "the most interesting point is that the local structure of helices can be rather complicated owing to symmetry - driven frustrations .",
    "we hope that qualitatively all the considered features will appear also in more sophisticated models taking into account the itinerant nature of magnetism and thermal and quantum properties of spiral ordering in mnsi .",
