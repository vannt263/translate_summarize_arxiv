    "there are now about 65 isolated magnetic white dwarfs known , and a further 90 accreting magnetic white dwarfs ( see wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 , hereafter wf , for a recent review ) .",
    "interesting differences are emerging between the isolated and accreting populations .",
    "measured field strengths of the isolated wds range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , whereas the range of field strengths of accreting wds may be smaller .",
    "the magnetic field strengths in the am her binaries are directly measured to be in the range @xmath9@xmath10 , and the magnetic fields of the intermediate polars ( ips ) are inferred to range from @xmath11 down to @xmath12 .",
    "the observed fraction of magnetic systems is 5% for isolated wds , but 25% for accreting systems .",
    "there is evidence that isolated magnetic white dwarfs are more massive than the typical @xmath13 non - magnetic wd , with a mean mass @xmath14 .",
    "measurements of accreting magnetic white dwarfs , however , give masses @xmath15 , consistent with measured masses of non - magnetic ( @xmath16 ) accretors .",
    "one similarity between isolated and accreting wds is that the magnetic field is often seen to be complex , with a significant quadrupole ( or offset dipole ) component .",
    "the origin and evolution of white dwarf magnetism is an important , but as yet unsolved , part of our understanding of stellar evolution .",
    "several papers have discussed the evolution of magnetic fields in isolated , cooling white dwarfs .",
    "ohmic decay of magnetic fields was first addressed by chanmugam & gabriel ( 1972 ) , and fontaine , thomas , & van horn ( 1973 ) , who showed that the decay time of the lowest order decay eigenmodes was longer than the evolutionary time of the white dwarf .",
    "wendell , van horn , & sargent ( 1987 ; hereafter wvs ) followed the evolution of different decay modes along a cooling sequence .",
    "they found that the fundamental dipole mode decayed by a factor of two in @xmath17 years .",
    "these studies suggested that wd magnetic fields are fossil fields left over from previous evolution .",
    "for example , one proposal consistent with the high masses ( @xmath14 ) of magnetic white dwarfs is that they result from evolution of the strongly magnetic ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) ap and bp main sequence stars",
    ". the higher order field components decay more rapidly , however , leading muslimov , van horn , & wood ( 1995 , hereafter mvw ) to study the hall effect as a way to generate field complexity during the lifetime of the white dwarf .",
    "the result that white dwarf magnetic fields evolve only very slightly over their lifetime has been applied in almost all studies of accreting white dwarfs .",
    "for example , in evolutionary studies of magnetic cataclysmic variables , it is presumed that the magnetic field of the white dwarf does not change with time .",
    "one exception is king ( 1985 ) , who applied the results of moss ( 1979 ) to accreting systems , and suggested that meridional currents could submerge magnetic flux in the outer layers of rotating magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the process of accretion itself may significantly change the surface magnetic field of an accreting white dwarf .",
    "many authors have studied the effects of accretion on the magnetic field of accreting neutron stars .",
    "this is motivated by the idea that the rapidly rotating millisecond radio pulsars are produced by accretion , which spins up the neutron star to short periods , and perhaps causes a reduction in magnetic field strength from the @xmath20 fields seen in most radio pulsars to the @xmath21@xmath8 fields of the millisecond pulsars ( see bhattacharya 1995 for a review ) . in a recent paper , cumming ,",
    "zweibel , & bildsten ( 2001 ; hereafter czb ) returned to the suggestion that the accretion flow directly screens the internal magnetic field ( romani 1990 , 1995 ) .",
    "they compared the timescales for ohmic diffusion and accretion in the thin outer layers of the neutron star , and computed steady - state magnetic profiles , taking the field to be horizontal and the accreted matter to be unmagnetized .",
    "for this simplified geometry , the field was found to be strongly screened for accretion rates greater than the critical rate @xmath22 , whereas at lower accretion rates , the underlying magnetic field was able to penetrate the freshly accreted material .",
    "this result fits nicely with the observation that the only weakly - magnetic accreting neutron star to show its magnetic field directly ( the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar , sax  j@xmath23-@xmath24 ; wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) has a lower accretion rate than other systems ( time - averaged @xmath25 ) , low enough that screening would not be effective in hiding its field .",
    "a crucial question for the evolution of accreting white dwarfs is whether the white dwarf mass increases or decreases with time . for accretion rates @xmath26 , the accreted hydrogen and helium burns unstably , giving rise to classical nova explosions ( e.g. , see fujimoto 1982 ; macdonald 1983 ) .",
    "the observed heavy element enrichment of nova ejecta has been used to argue that the nova explosion excavates material from the white dwarf , so that its mass is decreasing with time ( e.g. , livio & truran 1992 ) . however , this is a somewhat open question , both because of uncertainty in measurements of ejecta masses , and in theoretical modelling .",
    "theoretical calculations find that mixing of extra cno nuclei into the burning shell is needed to achieve rapid enough energy release to drive novae with rapid rise times .",
    "however , the mixing mechanism is presently unknown .",
    "prialnik and kovetz ( 1995 ) addressed this question with hydrodynamic simulations including diffusion , and found that the white dwarf mass decreased for @xmath27 , and increased for @xmath28 . at intermediate accretion rates ,",
    "the mass loss depended on the white dwarf temperature .",
    "the accretion rates of ips are estimated to be @xmath29 ( see discussion in  5.1 ) , and their core temperatures in the middle of the range considered by prialnik and kovetz ( 1995 ) ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , am her systems accrete at typical rates @xmath30 (  5.1 )",
    ". thus a range of behaviour might be expected within the population of accreting magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "the magnetic field of the white dwarf itself may affect the nova outburst , for example by enhancing mass loss in the equatorial plane ( livio , shankar , & truran 1988 ; livio 1995 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we assume that the white dwarf mass _ increases _ with time during accretion , and study the consequences for the evolution of the white dwarf magnetic field .",
    "we leave the case of decreasing white dwarf mass for a future study .",
    "we first show that comparing accretion and ohmic diffusion times in white dwarfs gives the same critical accretion rate @xmath4@xmath31 as found for neutron stars by czb ( for reasons we describe in  3 ) , and then go on to calculate the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "we show that the resulting field evolution may explain several properties of observed systems .",
    "a complication in calculating the evolution of the magnetic field in both accreting neutron stars and white dwarfs is that the accretion flow is channelled onto the magnetic polar cap ( for white dwarfs , this occurs for @xmath32 ) . rather than tackle the complex problem of the subsequent spreading of matter and evolution of the magnetic field",
    ", czb presumed that the neutron star magnetic field was buried by the accretion flow into a flattened configuration , and then used a plane - parallel model to ask what accretion rate was needed to keep the field from reemerging by ohmic diffusion . in this paper",
    ", the simplification we make is to study the evolution of the global magnetic field _ under",
    "spherical accretion_. the accreted matter is expected to spread away from the polar cap when the magnetic tension force no longer supports the hydrostatic pressure ( e.g. , hameury et al .",
    "1983 ) , so that spherical accretion is a good approximation except in a thin layer of mass @xmath33 for a @xmath34 white dwarf , where @xmath35 is the surface field strength .",
    "we include the uncertainty of what happens in this thin spreading layer as an uncertainty in the surface boundary condition for the spherically accreting models ( see discussion in  4.1 ) .",
    "we start in  2 by considering ohmic decay in accreting white dwarfs , which have liquid interiors because of compressional heating by accretion . in  3 , we compare the timescales for ohmic decay and accretion , and relate our results to those of czb . in  4 ,",
    "we calculate the global evolution of the field , under simplifying assumptions about its geometry , for different accretion rates .",
    "we relate our models to the recent calculations of choudhuri & konar ( 2002 ) for accreting neutron stars , which adopt a similar approach .",
    "we find that for @xmath36 , the surface field strength is reduced by accretion because ohmic diffusion is not rapid enough to allow penetration of field into the newly accreted layers . in  5 we discuss the implications of our results for observed systems . in  6 , we conclude with some speculations about magnetic field evolution in the alternative scenario of decreasing white dwarf mass with time . in the appendix , we describe our calculations of electrical conductivity for arbitrary degeneracy .",
    "in this section , we discuss ohmic decay of the magnetic field , neglecting the effects of accretion for now . in an accreting white dwarf , compressional heating of the core results in a central temperature @xmath37 ( nomoto 1982 ) , so that the interior is kept in a liquid state . in that case",
    ", the electrical conductivity is independent of temperature , allowing us to use simple zero - temperature white dwarf models .",
    "we calculate the ohmic decay modes following the original work of chanmugam & gabriel ( 1972 ) , fontaine et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , and wvs .",
    "we show that the lowest order decay mode has a decay time @xmath38 , depending on white dwarf mass .",
    "ohmic decay is described by the induction equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath41 the electrical conductivity .",
    "the associated characteristic decay timescale is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 the lengthscale over which @xmath44 changes .",
    "compressional heating maintains the interior of most accreting white dwarfs in a liquid state .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath45 is determined by the condition @xmath46 ( e.g. , farouki & hamaguchi 1993 ) , where @xmath47 measures the ratio of coulomb to thermal energy . for simplicity , we write @xmath48 for a single species of ion with charge @xmath49 , mass @xmath50 and interion spacing @xmath51 , giving @xmath52 compressional heating gives core temperatures @xmath53 ( nomoto 1982 ) , thus we expect most accreting white dwarfs to have liquid interiors .",
    "it is possible that some massive white dwarfs with central densities @xmath54 accreting at low enough rates have solid cores , but we do not consider these systems here .",
    "the electrical conductivity in the liquid interior is set by collisions between the degenerate electrons and the non - degenerate ions .",
    "the conductivity is @xmath55 ( e.g.  yakovlev & urpin 1980 ; itoh et al .",
    "1983 ; schatz et al .",
    "1999 ) , where @xmath56 measures the fermi momentum @xmath57 of the electrons , @xmath58 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath59 is a measure of the mean nuclear charge , given by @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the nuclear charge , @xmath62 the mass , and @xmath63 the mass fraction of species @xmath64 , and @xmath65 the mean molecular weight per electron . in terms of @xmath66 ,",
    "the density is @xmath67 .",
    "the fact that conductivity is independent of temperature allows us to adopt simple zero - temperature white dwarf models . in the outer envelope , where the electrons are non - degenerate , the conductivity is temperature - dependent . in the appendix",
    ", we describe a method for calculating the electrical conductivity for arbitrary degeneracy . however , the results of this section are insensitive to the conductivity in the outermost layers .",
    "we adopt pressure as the independent variable , and integrate the equations of hydrostatic balance and mass conservation outwards from the centre of the white dwarf for an initial choice of central density .",
    "we stop the integration once the pressure falls below some fixed fraction of the central pressure , at which point the radius and mass are well - determined .",
    "we assume the composition is an equal mixture by mass of carbon and oxygen , giving @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "some properties of these zero - temperature white dwarfs are shown in figure [ fig : models ] .",
    "we show the radius , central density , central conductivity @xmath70 , and ohmic time at the centre , @xmath71 , as a function of white dwarf mass .    despite the large variations in @xmath72 and @xmath70 , the ohmic time at the centre does not depend very strongly on white dwarf mass , ranging from @xmath73@xmath74 . to see why , we note that at the centre of the white dwarf @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 .",
    "however , if the mass - radius relation is @xmath77 , then @xmath78 , giving @xmath79 .",
    "the ohmic time @xmath80 is thus approximately constant with mass . as the white dwarf mass increases , the increase in conductivity is offset by the decreasing radius .",
    "most of the variation in @xmath81 seen in figure [ fig : models ] comes from the coulomb logarithm ( see appendix for our calculation of @xmath82 ) .",
    "the difference between ohmic decay times in isolated white dwarfs with liquid and solid cores has been pointed out previously , particularly by mvw . for a solid ,",
    "the conductivity is set by collisions of electrons with phonons , which become more common with increasing temperature ( for example , see yakovlev & urpin 1980 ; baiko & yakovlev 1995 ) .",
    "an example is figure 2 of wvs , in which both the conductivity and decay timescale are roughly constant for the first @xmath83 years of cooling history when the core is liquid , but then increase with time as the core becomes solid and cools .",
    "the ohmic time at the centre @xmath81 is an overestimate of the time for magnetic field decay , since both the conductivity and radial lengthscale are largest at the centre .",
    "to do better , we now find the ohmic decay eigenmodes for liquid white dwarfs , following the original work of chanmugam & gabriel ( 1972 ) , fontaine et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , and wvs .",
    "we assume an axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field , @xmath84 which we write in terms of a vector potential @xmath85 where @xmath86 ( see mestel 1999 for a useful discussion ) . using the identity @xmath87",
    ", we find @xmath88 so that the quantity @xmath89 labels the magnetic field lines .    rewriting equation ( [ eq : decay ] ) , we find the time evolution of @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 we now seperate @xmath92 into radial and angular pieces , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the associated legendre function of order @xmath95 .",
    "the magnetic field components are @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the legendre polynomial .",

    "in which the diffusivity depends on radius @xmath100 only , and not on latitude @xmath101 . in this case , substituting equation ( [ eq : expand ] ) into equation ( [ eq : dadt ] ) gives @xmath102,\\ ] ] a diffusion equation for the radial function @xmath103 .    neglecting mass and density changes due to accretion ,",
    "the conductivity of a liquid white dwarf is independent of time , and depends only on position , @xmath104 . in this case",
    ", we follow wvs , and look for a solution which decays exponentially with decay time @xmath105 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a constant giving the contribution of mode @xmath108 , and the differential equation @xmath109 determines the eigenfunction @xmath110 .",
    "we adopt the following boundary conditions ( see discussion in  5.6 of mestel 1999 ) .",
    "inspection of equation ( [ eq : mode ] ) shows that a finite solution at the centre of the star must have @xmath111 , giving @xmath112 outside the star , where the current @xmath113 , we choose the solution which remains finite for large @xmath100 , @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we take @xmath115 at the surface .",
    ".ohmic decay times ( @xmath105 in units of @xmath116 years)[tab : times ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     solution of equation ( [ eq : mode ] ) requires the conductivity as a function of radius .",
    "this is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : modes ] for a @xmath34 white dwarf , normalized to the central value , @xmath117 .",
    "the resulting @xmath118 and @xmath119 dipole ( @xmath120 ) decay modes @xmath121 are shown as solid lines in the middle panel of figure [ fig : modes ] .",
    "the lower panel shows the current density @xmath122 .",
    "using equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 10 ) , this may be written in terms of @xmath121 as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 note that the @xmath108th mode has @xmath125 nodes , the current reversing direction at a node .",
    "table [ tab : times ] gives the decay time for modes with @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and @xmath128 and @xmath127 for @xmath13 and @xmath129 white dwarfs .",
    "for both white dwarf masses , we find that the lowest order decay mode ( @xmath120 and @xmath118 ) has a decay time @xmath130 , roughly a factor of four smaller than the analytic result for @xmath131 independent of radius ( in which case @xmath132 , see wvs eq .  [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the decay times in table [ tab : times ] agree well with the calculations of wvs for liquid white dwarfs ( compare their figure 2 ) .",
    "however , we do not agree with the later calculations of mvw , who report decay times an order of magnitude smaller , @xmath133 , for liquid white dwarfs ( see their  3.3 ) , despite using the same conductive opacities for the liquid interior as wvs ( see their  2.3 ) .",
    "the origin of this difference is not clear .",
    "the central conductivity quoted by mvw for a @xmath13 white dwarf ( @xmath134 ) agrees to a factor of two with the value in both our models and those of wvs .",
    "in addition , changing the conductivity profile seems unlikely to give an order of magnitude change in the decay time .",
    "the difference may be due to an incorrect normalization used by mvw ( h.  van horn , private communication ) .    to test the influence of the conductivity profile , we compared our eigenfunctions with those of wvs and mvw ( figure 3 , left panel , of wvs ; figure 1 , top panel of mvw ) .",
    "the agreement is good for times @xmath135 , but differs for earlier times , for which the wvs and mvw eigenfunctions peak at larger radius ( @xmath136 rather than @xmath137 ) .",
    "we have been unable to identify the reason for this difference .",
    "the peak at larger radius likely reflects a shallower conductivity profile .",
    "for example , in the extreme case of constant conductivity with radius , the currents are less centrally - concentrated than in realistic models .",
    "the reason for this is that the currents flow in the regions of high conductivity ; this region is more extended in the constant conductivity model .",
    "the dashed lines in the middle and lower panels of figure [ fig : modes ] show the @xmath118 , @xmath120 eigenmode for constant conductivity ( in this case @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the spherical bessel function of degree 1 , see wvs ) .",
    "as noted above , the lowest order decay time for constant conductivity is a factor @xmath140 longer than the realistic white dwarf models .    in summary",
    ", we find that the ohmic decay time lies in the range @xmath141@xmath1 billion years for a dipole field , and @xmath142@xmath3 billion years for a quadrupole field , depending only slightly on white dwarf mass .",
    "the long timescale for ohmic decay raises the question of the effect of the accretion flow on the magnetic field structure .",
    "the decay timescale of @xmath143 is the time to accrete the whole star at @xmath144 . for more rapid accretion than this",
    ", one might expect the magnetic field structure to be significantly altered as the magnetic field is advected by the accretion flow .",
    "in fact , the evolution of the magnetic field depends on the local accretion and diffusion timescales at different depths in the white dwarf envelope . in this section ,",
    "we compute these timescales , before moving on to simple models of the global field structure in  4 .",
    "we consider the outer layers of the star , where the gravity @xmath145 is constant .",
    "we define the column depth @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the mass above column depth @xmath148 .",
    "hydrostatic balance @xmath149 becomes @xmath150 , giving @xmath151 .",
    "the time to accrete the matter above a given column depth is @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the local accretion rate per unit area . we compare this with the ohmic diffusion time across a scale height , @xmath154 .",
    "when the electrons are degenerate , the conductivity is given by equation ( [ eq : sig ] ) .",
    "in the outer layers , the electrons are non - relativistic , so that @xmath155 .",
    "the pressure scale height is @xmath156 , giving @xmath157 to evaluate the accretion timescale , we write the local accretion rate @xmath158 in terms of the global rate @xmath159 , as @xmath153 , giving @xmath160 if accretion is not occuring over the whole surface of the white dwarf , for example magnetically - controlled accretion onto the polar caps , the relevant quantity is the local accretion rate ; we work in terms of the global rate only for convenience .",
    "we find @xmath161 the ratio of @xmath162 to @xmath163 depends on the quantity @xmath164 , which we rewrite in terms of the mass of the star , @xmath165 .",

    "as described above , we take the composition of the accreted material to be equal mass fractions of c and o. at the centre of the star , where @xmath227 vanishes , we apply equation ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) .",
    "the `` vacuum '' boundary condition implies @xmath228 outside the star , as in  2 , and that each shell of matter is accreted with the vacuum field at the surface .",
    "this boundary condition was adopted by choudhuri & konar ( 2002 ) in their recent study of accreting neutron stars ( these authors solved eq .  [ [ eq : av ] ] with a prescribed 2d velocity field ) . in our 1d model ,",
    "we envisage this boundary condition as approximating the case where the accreted material is able to spread away from the polar cap without significantly distorting the field structure .",
    "this is similar to choudhuri & konar ( 2002 ) , who put in an outwards radial velocity in the outer layers to simulate the effects of buoyancy instabilities .",

    "the surface field decreases due to ohmic decay ( in this case the accretion takes @xmath17 years , comparable to the decay time ) . for @xmath197 ,",
    "the change is directly due to accretion .",
    "in the previous sections , we have shown that , under the assumption that the white dwarf retains the mass it accretes , the surface magnetic field may be significantly reduced for accretion rates greater than the critical value @xmath4@xmath31 .",
    "we now conclude by discussing the implications of our results for observed systems .",
    "we show that there are several interesting consequences of abandoning the assumption that the magnetic fields of accreting white dwarfs do not change with time .",
    "accreting white dwarfs fall into two classes .",
    "those in am her systems rotate synchronously with the binary orbital period , and have fields @xmath9@xmath260 ( wf ) . intermediate polars ( see review by patterson 1994 ) , in which the white dwarf rotates asynchronously , are believed to contain white dwarfs with fields @xmath261@xmath262 , although most have not been measured directly ( the lower limit here is the field strength needed to disrupt the accretion flow before it hits the white dwarf surface ) .",
    "the asynchronous rotation of the white dwarfs in ips lead to early suggestions that the white dwarf magnetic fields are lower than in am hers ( for example , lamb & patterson 1983 estimated @xmath263 ) . in addition , whereas strong optical polarization is seen in am hers , little or no polarization is seen in ips , also suggesting weaker magnetic fields .",
    "recently , the lack of zeeman splitting in spectroscopic observations of the white dwarf in v709  cas ( bonnet - bidaud et al .",
    "2001 ) has constrained the magnetic field to be @xmath264 .",
    "the two classes show an interesting difference in accretion rates .",
    "am her systems accrete at low rates , @xmath265 ( chanmugam , ray , & singh 1991 ; warner 1995 ) , whereas the ips accrete rapidly , warner ( 1995 ) estimates @xmath266@xmath267 from x - ray fluxes of ten systems .",
    "wickramasinghe & wu ( 1994 ) propose that the low accretion rate of am hers is a direct consequence of the strong magnetic field of the white dwarf , which inhibits magnetic braking by reducing the number of open field lines along which the magnetized wind from the secondary may flow ( for example , see li , wickramasinghe , & wu 1995 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : periodhist ] shows the orbital period distributions of known am hers and ips .",
    "most am her systems have @xmath268 hours , whereas most ips have @xmath269@xmath270 hours .",
    "this difference has led many to suggest an evolutionary link between the two classes , namely that the asynchronous ips are the progenitors of the synchronous am her systems . for a magnetic field @xmath271",
    ", the magnetospheric radius equals the orbital separation at @xmath272 , suggesting a natural dividing line between synchronous and asynchronous systems ( chanmugam & ray 1984 ; king , frank , & ritter 1985 ; hameury et al .",
    "1987 ) . however , an evolutionary connection is difficult if the white dwarf magnetic field is constant with time ( e.g. , wu & wickramasinghe 1993 ) .",
    "it requires either ( i ) the ips and am hers have similar magnetic field strengths , but the optical polarization is somehow suppressed in asynchronous rotators , or ( ii ) the ips have weaker fields than the am her systems , implying a yet to be detected population of asynchronous am her progenitors ( king & lasota 1991 ) .    it is striking that the mean accretion rate of the ips is @xmath273 , whereas the am her systems accrete at rates @xmath274 .",
    "thus , given our results , a natural suggestion is that the magnetic fields of the intermediate polars are low because of the direct effects of the accretion flow .",
    "if so , it is possible for an intermediate polar to evolve into an am her system if the mass transfer rate to drops from @xmath273 to @xmath274 at an orbital period @xmath275@xmath276 hours ( between the observed am her and intermediate polar populations ) .",
    "the reason for such a change in accretion rate is not clear , but is reminiscent of the need for a rapid drop in mass transfer rate to explain the period gap ( @xmath277@xmath127 hours ) in non - magnetic cvs .",
    "whether or not the magnetic cvs exhibit a period gap is unclear , there are certainly a higher fraction of magnetic systems in the gap than for non - magnetic systems ( king 1994 ; kolb 1995 ; wheatley 1995 ) .",
    "it is however possible that a similar mechanism is operating in both cases , perhaps disrupted magnetic braking , as preferred for non - magnetic systems ( rappaport , verbunt & joss 1983 ; howell , nelson , & rappaport 2001 ) .",
    "there is an alternative scenario along the same lines as that of wickramasinghe & wu ( 1994 ) .",
    "the rosat detection of ips with soft x - ray spectra similar to weaker field am hers ( haberl & motch 1995 ) has led to suggestions of two populations of ips .",
    "a possibility is that those ips with fields close to @xmath9 g come into synchronous rotation at @xmath278 hours , which causes a drop in @xmath279 as suggested by wickramasinghe & wu ( 1994 ) , allowing the field to subsequently grow to values @xmath280 typical of am hers .",
    "a problem with this picture is what happens to the weaker field ips ( i.e. , those with traditional hard x - ray spectra ) , since very few of them are seen at short orbital periods .",
    "the timescale for reemergence of the field is set by the ohmic diffusion time at the base of the accreted layer .",
    "figure 4 and equation ( 16 ) show that this is @xmath281 where @xmath147 is the accreted mass .",
    "this is similar to the time for a non - magnetic cv to cross the period gap ( howell et al .",
    "thus if the drop in mass accretion rate causes the secondary to lose contact with the roche lobe , there may be time for the field to reemerge before contact is resumed .",
    "the impact of any gap on the observed orbital period distribution depends on how strongly the transition orbital period depends on mass transfer rate and magnetic field . with or without a period gap ,",
    "the lack of known synchronous low field systems could constrain the timescale for reemergence and therefore accreted mass .    a detailed test of either scenario requires comparison of evolutionary studies and the observed populations of ips and am hers .",
    "we note that whereas there is a clear difference in orbital periods and magnetic field strengths between am hers and ips as classes of objects , no correlation is observed between magnetic field strength and orbital period amongst am her systems only ( wf ) .",
    "the highest measured magnetic field in an accreting system is @xmath282 for ar uma , whereas the highest observed fields in isolated wds are close to @xmath8 . whether or not this difference is significant remains to be seen .",
    "for example , wf argue that selection effects hide the very high field accreting wds .",
    "there have been suggestions as to why the observed upper limit might differ .",
    "wickramasinghe & wu ( 1994 ) argue that because the high field systems come into synchronization at wider separation , magnetic braking is suppressed earlier , and they do not have time to evolve via gravitational radiation into contact ( thus they predict a population of high field , detached binaries ) .",
    "we would like to point out that some difference would be expected simply because of the different ohmic decay properties of the two populations .",
    "the liquid accreting white dwarfs decay at a faster rate than the isolated white dwarfs , which form a solid core after @xmath283 years of cooling , effectively switching off ohmic decay . to find the maximum difference between the two populations",
    ", we assume the isolated white dwarfs undergo no magnetic field decay .",
    "the contrast in field strengths is then @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is the decay time for the accreting population . for @xmath286 ,",
    "this gives a factor of 2 after @xmath287 billion years , or a factor of 3 after @xmath288 billion years .",
    "this effect alone may not explain the observed factor of @xmath289 , but should be taken into account when comparing the maximum field strengths of the two populations .",
    "currently favoured models for type ia supernovae progenitors are rapidly accreting ( @xmath290 @xmath291 ) massive white dwarfs , which are able to burn the accreted hydrogen and helium steadily and grow to near - chandrasekhar mass .",
    "examples are the white dwarfs in supersoft x - ray sources and symbiotic binaries .",
    "if accretion is acting to suppress the surface magnetic field in these sources as we propose for intermediate polars , we would not expect to find strongly magnetic white dwarfs in these systems .",
    "there is little information about the incidence of magnetism in these rapidly accreting systems . in a survey of 35 symbiotics ,",
    "sokoloski & bildsten ( 1999 ) ( see also sokoloski , bildsten , & ho 2001 ) discovered a magnetic wd in the symbiotic binary z and rotating with a 28 minute spin period .",
    "if the white dwarf is in spin equilibrium with an accretion disk at the magnetospheric radius , the implied magnetic field strength is @xmath292 , typical of an intermediate polar .",
    "xmm observations of m31 revealed a supersoft x - ray source with 865s pulsations , interpreted as the spin of a magnetized white dwarf ( osborne et al .",
    "a similar estimate for the magnetic field gives @xmath293 ( king , osborne , & schenker 2002 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen how common systems like these are amongst rapidly accreting sources .",
    "as the central density increases due to accretion , the internal field is amplified by compression ( @xmath246 ; see  4.2 ) .",
    "this amplification is shown in figure 5 for accretion onto a @xmath13 white dwarf , and would be even greater for a massive white dwarf .",
    "the density increases especially quickly as you approach chandrasekhar mass and the electrons become more relativistic , as pointed out by work on compressional heating ( nomoto 1982 ; townsley & bildsten 2001 , 2002 ) . an important problem is to understand the role played by such an amplified magnetic field in the approach to and evolution after ignition of a type ia supernova .",
    "for example , ghezzi et al .  ( 2001 ) , recently pointed out that a large scale magnetic field of @xmath21@xmath8 can generate asymmetries in the thermonuclear flame front that engulfs the white dwarf during the supernova .",
    "our results show that the prior evolution of the field during accretion should be taken into account .      both isolated and",
    "accreting white dwarfs often show a complex magnetic field geometry , requiring a significant quadrupole component or an offset dipole ( wf ) . in  2 , we found decay times of @xmath2@xmath294 for the @xmath295 decay mode of liquid white dwarfs .",
    "thus one possibility is that the quadrupole field is fossil , requiring that the dipole and quadrupole fields had comparable magnitudes initially .    in isolated systems ,",
    "the liquid decay time is relevant only for the first @xmath296 , after which the formation of a solid core increases the ohmic time .",
    "muslimov et al .",
    "( 1995 ) studied the hall effect in isolated white dwarfs as a possible mechanism for generating field complexity as the white dwarf cools .",
    "however , the hall effect is not expected to play a significant role for a liquid interior ( muslimov et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the accretion flow directly leads to complexity of the field .",
    "the spreading of material away from the polar cap ( which we have not included in our models in this paper ) could induce higher order components of the surface field .",
    "an interesting observation is that the magnetic pole undergoing most accretion in am her systems is the pole with the weaker magnetic field in all cases with magnetic field measurements for both poles ( wf ) .",
    "wickramasinghe & wu ( 1991 ) suggest that this is a result of the role of the quadrupole component during synchronisation .",
    "an alternative suggested by our results is that after synchronisation occurs , the pole pointing towards the companion undergoes more rapid accretion which reduces the field strength at that pole , giving rise to the observed asymmetry .",
    "even though the global rate for am hers is @xmath274 , the local accretion rate in the layers for which the accreted material is still confined to the polar cap will be greater than the critical rate .",
    "detailed models of the spreading of material away from the polar cap are required to investigate this further .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the magnetic field in an accreting white dwarf .",
    "previous studies of ohmic decay in isolated white dwarfs showed that the ohmic decay time is always longer than the cooling time because the white dwarf develops a solid core . in  2 , we calculated the ohmic decay times for the lowest order modes of accreting white dwarfs , which have a liquid interior because of compressional heating by accretion .",
    "we found that the lowest order ohmic decay time is @xmath0@xmath297 for a dipole field , and @xmath2@xmath298 for a quadrupole field ( see table 1 ) , in good agreement with the earlier calculations of wvs .",
    "the difference in ohmic decay times between isolated and accreting white dwarfs should be taken into account when comparing the maximum field strengths of the two populations .",
    "in addition , the decay timescale for the quadrupole is long enough that observed quadrupole components ( see wf for a summary of the observations ) in both accreting and isolated white dwarfs may be fossil if the quadrupole is initially of similar strength to the dipole component .    in",
    " 3 , we compared the timescale for ohmic decay with accretion , and showed that accretion occurs more rapidly than ohmic diffusion for accretion rates greater than the critical rate @xmath299@xmath5 . in  4 , we calculated the time evolution of the magnetic field as a function of accretion rate , assuming the white dwarf mass increases with time . for a simplified field and accretion geometry ( an axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field and spherical accretion )",
    ", we found that accretion at rates @xmath36 leads to a reduction in the field strength at the surface , as the field is advected into the interior by the accretion flow .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that , due to the direct action of accretion , significant changes in the surface magnetic field of an accreting white dwarf could occur during its accretion lifetime . in  5 , we showed that accretion induced magnetic field evolution may explain several features of observed systems .",
    "most striking is that the strongly magnetic ( @xmath300@xmath260 ) am her systems have a mean accretion rate @xmath301 whereas the weakly magnetic ( @xmath302@xmath11 ) ips accrete at rates @xmath303 .",
    "this raises the possibility that the white dwarfs in ips have subsurface fields as strong as those in am hers .",
    "if so , this allows for an evolutionary connection between the long orbital period ( @xmath269@xmath270 hours ) ips and short orbital period am hers ( @xmath268 hours ) , requiring that evolution in orbital period somehow causes a drop in accretion rate ( for example , by disrupted magnetic braking as postulated for non - magnetic cvs ; see  5.1 for further discussion ) .",
    "the magnetic field would then reemerge on a timescale set by ohmic diffusion , @xmath304 , where @xmath147 is the accreted mass .",
    "evolutionary calculations are necessary to compare this scenario with the properties of observed systems .",
    "we did not consider non - magnetic accreting systems in  5 ; however , it is possible that many non - magnetic white dwarfs ( meaning @xmath16 so that the accretion flow is not disrupted ) have submerged magnetic fields if they are accreting at rates @xmath305 .",
    "the models presented in this paper are simplified , and many outstanding theoretical questions remain .",
    "the major uncertainty in the evolution of accreting white dwarfs is whether the white dwarf mass increases or decreases with time . even if the mass is increasing with time as we have assumed here , classical nova explosions eject some mass from the system ; the effective mass accretion rate is therefore less than the mass transfer rate from the secondary by some factor , introducing an extra uncertainty .",
    "if classical novae eject more mass than accreted prior to the thermal runaway , excavation of the white dwarf core leads to a decreasing mass with time .",
    "this raises the possibility that the surface magnetic field could grow with time if underlying magnetic field is exposed as the mass decreases .",
    "this was originally suggested as a source for the magnetic field of dq her by lamb ( 1974 ) .",
    "interestingly , this alternative is also consistent with an evolutionary link between am hers and intermediate polars , since the magnetic field would increase as the orbital period decreases and successive nova explosions occur .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field under the action of mass loss is left to a future study .",
    "the result is presumably somewhat dependent on the initial choice for the current distribution , and differences in the thermal evolution will have to be taken into account .",
    "it is important to understand the spreading of matter away from the polar cap .",
    "this topic has received little attention , and is not well - understood .",
    "studies of the polar cap of accreting neutron stars ( hameury et al .  1983 ;",
    "brown & bildsten 1998 ; litwin , brown , & rosner 2001 ) and white dwarfs ( livio 1983 ; hameury & lasota 1985 ) suggest that spreading occurs once the sideways force due to the hydrostatic overpressure overcomes the confining magnetic tension , or sooner if instabilites play a role ( litwin et al .",
    "2001 ) . understanding the spreading process , and its affect on the magnetic field geometry in the outermost layers of the star is directly relevant for interpreting observations of polar cap fields of am hers .",
    "a related issue which remains to be explored is the stability of the magnetic field configurations found in  4 .",
    "for example , stability considerations demand a toroidal field component which is not included in our simple models ( see discussion in mestel 1999 ) .    finally , we have not discussed the effect of white dwarf rotation . as mentioned in the introduction , king ( 1985 ) , applying the results of moss ( 1979 ) to accreting white dwarfs , suggested that meridional currents could be responsible for the submergence of magnetic flux in the outer layers of rotating magnetic white dwarfs .",

    "<S> we show that the lowest order ohmic decay time is @xmath0@xmath1 billion years for a dipole field , and @xmath2@xmath3 billion years for a quadrupole field . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the timescales for ohmic diffusion and accretion at different depths in the star , and for a simplified field structure and assuming spherical accretion , study the time - dependent evolution of the global magnetic field at different accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect mass loss by classical nova explosions and assume the white dwarf mass increases with time . in this case , the field structure in the outer layers of the white dwarf is significantly modified for accretion rates above the critical rate @xmath4@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the implications of our results for observed systems . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that accretion - induced magnetic field changes are the missing evolutionary link between am her systems and intermediate polars . </S>",
    "<S> the shorter ohmic decay time for accreting white dwarfs provides a partial explanation of the lack of accreting systems with @xmath6 fields . in rapidly accreting systems such as supersoft x - ray sources , </S>",
    "<S> amplification of internal fields by compression may be important for type ia supernova ignition and explosion . finally , </S>",
    "<S> spreading matter in the polar cap may induce complexity in the surface magnetic field , and explain why the more strongly accreting pole in am her systems has a weaker field . </S>",
