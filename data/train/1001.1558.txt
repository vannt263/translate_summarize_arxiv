    "in the work @xcite , as well as in its arxive preprints @xcite and premising works @xcite , based on principles and methods of rigorous statistical mechanics , - first of all , on the bogolyubov approach to it @xcite , - i proved existence of general exact relations ( `` virial relations '' ) connecting ( i ) probability law of random walk of a test `` brownian '' particle ( bp ) in a fluid and ( ii ) irreducible many - particle statistical correlations between molecules of the fluid and the bp s walk ( in particular , bp may be merely a marked molecule ) .",
    "i emphasized also that these relations make it clearly visible that all @xmath0particle correlations always are quantitatively significant , even under the low - density ( `` boltzmann - grad '' ) gas limit .",
    "this fact , in turn , implies that the boltzmannian kinetics is incorrect even in this limit , and true kinetics of fluids , - including low - density gases ! - should take into account all the correlations .",
    "the meaning of so universal correlations was explained already in @xcite ( this article is hardly available on - line , but one can read its my own author s translation @xcite from russian original , or see preprint @xcite ) . it is sufficient to notice that a fluid as the whole ( and first of all dilute gas ! ) is indifferent to a number of past collisions happened to its given particular molecule .",
    "therefore any molecule has no definite ( _ a priori _ predictable ) `` time - average '' rate of collisions @xcite . in other words ,",
    "actual rate of its collisions undergoes fluctuations which are indifferent to time averaging .",
    "thus that are scaleless fluctuations with 1/f type spectrum @xcite .",
    "the mentioned statistical correlations directly reflect complicity of particles ( via mutual collisions ) in these fluctuations and , hence , indirectly describe their statistics ( for detail see @xcite or @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "as far as i know , first such statements about molecular motion were put forward in works by g.bochkov and me @xcite as conjectures about origin and properties of 1/f noise accompanying charge transport ( i.e. brownian motion of charge carriers ) and other transport processes ( in generalized sense @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrated once again that correct ideology leads to useful results even at phenomenological level .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was shown that fluctuations of rate of collisions ( or , equivalently , 1/f fluctuations of diffusivity and mobility ) possess essentially non - gaussian statistics gravitating towards power - law probability tails .",
    "the latter circumstance requires , in view of the well known marcinkiewicz theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , to deal with whole infinite chain of cumulants of the fluctuations . on the other hand , according to the later works made at the microscopic level , firstly @xcite and then its development in @xcite , @xmath0-order cumulant of fluctuations in the rate of collisions associates with specifically @xmath1-particle correlations ( irreducible component of @xmath1-particle distribution function ) .",
    "that is why one should not truncate the bbgky hierarchy of equations ! anyway ,",
    "neglect of three - particle ( and thus higher ) correlations means rejection of the fluctuations at all ( like neglect of two - particle correlations rejects any collisions at all @xcite ) .",
    "the aforesaid was confirmed by exact results of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a specially visual analysis of inter - particle correlations may be useful .",
    "this is just one of purposes of the present paper .    with this purpose",
    "it is natural to concentrate on the brownian motion of ( molecular - size ) particle in ideal gas ( see @xcite or some of preprints @xcite and also @xcite ) , which is most simple `` kinetic process '' since it produces least amount of inter - particle correlations .",
    "besides , this is good motive to scan the limit transition from smooth interaction ( between bp and gas atoms ) to singular `` hard - sphere '' one dividing into momentary `` collisions '' .",
    "another our purpose is to perceive falsity of popular treatments of the `` hard - sphere bbgky hierarchy of equations ''",
    "@xcite trying to reduce it , in the boltzmann - grad limit , to so - called `` boltzmann hierarchy '' .",
    "we will begin in sec.2 by formulation of the bbgky hierarchy for our particular problem and corresponding ( above mentioned ) exact virial relations @xcite .",
    "after their consideration in sec.3 we will see for ourselves that collisions constantly give birth to various statistical correlations , and not only post - collision ones but also pre - collision correlations .",
    "then , in sec.4 , discuss and execute the hard - sphere limit of our bbgky hierarchy , taking in mind that it should stay compatible with the virial relations as they are independent on character of interactions ( interaction potentials ) .",
    "the result is ( i ) modified bbgky equations combined with ( ii ) familiar boundary conditions to them at hyper - surfaces ( in many - particle phase spaces ) corresponding to collisions .",
    "the second ingredient allows to transform the first into usual `` hard - sphere bbgky hierarchy '' but , at the same time , it forbids its reduction to the `` boltzmann hierarchy '' @xcite under the boltzmann - grad limit .",
    "thus , the correct theory does not present such marvellous simplifications as `` propagation of chaos '' and closed equation for one - particle distribution function ( df ) : as before , one has to solve an infinite hierarchy of equations !",
    "this situation will be discussed in sec.5 .",
    "we want to consider random walk @xmath2 of a brownian particle ( bp ) in thermodynamically equilibrium ideal gas , assuming that at initial time moment @xmath3 bp starts from certainly known position @xmath4 .",
    "the bbgky equations for this problem can be either derived @xcite directly from the liouville equation , following bogolyubov @xcite , or extracted @xcite from general results of @xcite .",
    "they reads as @xmath5+n \\,\\frac { \\partial } { \\partial { \\bf p}}\\int_{k+1}\\!\\!\\phi^{\\,\\prime}({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_{k+1 } ) \\,f_{k+1}\\,\\,\\,,\\label{fn}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is hamiltonian of subsystem `` @xmath8 atoms + bp '' , @xmath9\\,$ ] means the poisson brackets , @xmath10 is potential of ( short - range repulsive ) interaction between bp and atoms , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is gas density ( mean concentration of atoms ) , @xmath13 is normalized df of the bp s coordinate @xmath14 and momentum @xmath15 , @xmath16 are @xmath17-particle dfs for bp and @xmath18 atoms @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote coordinates and momenta of atoms , respectively , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "initial conditions to these equations , corresponding to the gas equilibrium , at temperature @xmath24 , are @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are masses of bp and atoms , respectively , @xmath28 is the maxwell momentum distribution of a particle with mass @xmath27 , and @xmath29}\\,$ ] .",
    "besides , existence of the thermodynamical limit presumes the `` cluster property '' of dfs .",
    "that is vanishing of inter - particle correlations under large spatial separation of particles , so that @xmath30 at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 does not include @xmath34 and @xmath35 . that are boundary conditions to eq.[fn ] .",
    "in view of these conditions , in order to visually extract inter - particle correlations , it is convenient to make the linear change of variables , from the dfs @xmath36 to new functions @xmath37 , @xcite as follow : @xmath38 and so on . with @xmath39 .",
    "clearly , such defined @xmath40 can be named cumulant functions ( cf ) since represent irreducible correlations between @xmath18 gas atoms and total bp s path @xmath14 . in their terms",
    "the bbgky hierarchy ( [ fn ] ) takes the form @xcite @xmath41+n \\,\\frac { \\partial } { \\partial { \\bf p}}\\int_{k+1}\\!\\ ! \\phi^{\\,\\prime}({\\bf",

    "the mentioned initial and boundary conditions simplify to @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "a careful enough scanning of these equations results in observation @xcite that exact relations @xmath49 take place .",
    "this is particular case of general `` virial relations '' found in @xcite as exact properties of solutions to bbgky equations describing molecular brownian motion in fluids ( they can be also deduced @xcite from the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite ) .",
    "these relations demonstrate existence and significance of all many - particle correlations . to see straight away that they keep significant in the boltzmann - grad limit ( bgl ) , let us introduce characteristic interaction radius @xmath50 of the potential @xmath51 , corresponding free - path length of bp , @xmath52 , and integrated correlations",
    "@xmath53 d{\\bf p}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath54 is probability distribution of the bp s path .",
    "then eqs.[me ] yield @xmath55 these exact relations hold at any values of @xmath50 and @xmath12 , hence , under bgl ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58const ) too .",
    "they show that anyway by order of magnitude @xmath59 .",
    "is the boltzmann s molecular chaos ( `` stoahlansatz '' ) compatible with virial relations ( [ me ] ) , ( [ intc ] ) ? may be , correlations there are purely post - collision and therefore do not contradict boltzmann s ansatz proclaiming absence of pre - collision correlations ?    unfortunately ,",
    "this is vain hope , and the answer is no . to make sure of this ,",
    "let us agree that post - collision ( _ out_- ) and pre - collision ( _ in_- ) states of bp and an atom satisfy @xmath60 or @xmath61 , respectively , - where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 being velocities , - and consider the first three of equations ( [ vn ] ) , @xmath66 c_{0}\\,\\,\\,\\ , , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\,\\",

    "out_-state '' of the particles .",
    "if we neglected three - particle correlation represented by cf @xmath69 then solution to eq.[vn1 ] would be just this post - collision correlation : @xmath70 .",
    "substitution of this @xmath71 to eq.[vn0 ] would yield a closed `` boltzmann - lorentz '' equation for the bp s distribution @xmath72 , thus realizing the dream of `` molecular chaos '' .",
    "however , the last term in eq.[vn2 ] , for @xmath69 , quite similarly ( even under neglect of @xmath73 ) produces three - particle correlations out of the two - particle one , @xmath74 . resulting @xmath69 contributes , via integral in eq.[vn1 ] , back to evolution of @xmath71 , and produces , in particular , pre - collision pair correlations between particles going to meet one another .",
    "in such way , @xmath71 acquires pre - collision component @xmath75 , thus turning the dream into a rough approximation .",
    "this is illustrated schematically by fig.1 .",
    ", into pre - collision pair correlation , @xmath75 , through three - particle correlation , @xmath69 .",
    "the `` brownian particle '' is represented by circles and entire arrows while gas atoms by dots , light lines and short arrows.,width=302 ]",
    "for further , first notice that eqs.[vn ] , [ vn0]-[vn2 ] can be written in equivalent form @xmath76\\,\\ , \\,\\,\\,\\ , \\,\\,\\,\\label{vnn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since these equations , as well as virial relations ( [ me ] ) and ( [ intc ] ) , are valid at any smooth interaction potential , we can extend them to the limit of `` hard - sphere '' interaction , for instance , defined by @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79const @xmath80 . at that , clearly , the bp s free path length must tend to a constant , @xmath81const",
    ". therefore at any stage of this limit transition all cfs @xmath37 are equally smooth functions of time ( except the very beginning of evolution ) , momenta and coordinates , excluding `` collision regions '' @xmath82 , where @xmath83 along with characteristic thickness h of the potential wall @xmath84 ( at that , satisfying @xmath85 ) .    in these collision regions , in opposite , @xmath37 ( @xmath86 ) become more and more sharp functions of @xmath68 , so that @xmath87 , similarly to @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the second and the fourth right - hand terms in eq.([vn1 ] ) , eq.([vn2 ] ) , etc . , both are infinitely increasing @xmath89 in collision regions and , in view of absence of other such terms , should compensate one another .",
    "equivalently , the expressions in square brackets in eqs.[vnn ] should become eigenfunctions of operators @xmath90 corresponding to zero eigenvalues , that is @xmath91\\,=\\,0\\ , \\,\\,\\ , \\,\\,\\ , \\label{cr1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] asymptotically , inside the collision regions .    this statement . in its turn , means that expression in the square brackets represents integral of motion , and its values at beginning and at end of the pair collision , are equal .",
    "thus , visualizing only variables what change during collision , we can write @xmath92 where @xmath93 , with @xmath94 being unit normal vector , and _ in_-states and _ out_-states correspond to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . and are connected via the limit collision dynamics ( mirror reflection ) : @xmath97    on the other hand , integration of ( [ cr1 ] ) over the collision region , - for instance , at @xmath98 , - yields @xmath99    substituting this equality into eqs.[vnn ] , for complement of the now forbidden regions @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 . at boundaries of the forbidden regions .",
    "i.e. at @xmath103 , these equations should be supplemented with boundary conditions ( [ cr2])-([mr ] ) . combining eqs.[vnn0 ] with ( [ cr3 ] ) and ( [ cr2 ] ) we come to @xmath104 \\,\\,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 , and momenta @xmath108 , @xmath109 being related to @xmath15 , @xmath110 in the same way as pre - collision momenta @xmath111 , @xmath112 in ( [ mr ] ) are related to post - collision ones , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and the integration involves pre - collision states only .    what is for the operators @xmath115 , in respect to cfs they are defined as @xmath116 at @xmath117 and by boundary conditions ( [ cr2 ] ) at @xmath118 .",
    "thus , importantly , @xmath115 are not mere translation operators : at collision surfaces @xmath118 they act as creation operators , creating @xmath17-order correlations from @xmath119-order ones .",
    "therefore factually @xmath37 remain coupled with both @xmath120 and @xmath121 , as in basic eqs.[vn ] . in other words , due to conditions ( [ cr2 ] ) , hierarchy ( [ cbh ] ) keeps characteristic * three - diagonal * structure of equations for cfs !    return from cfs back to dfs , according to the cfs definition ( [ cf ] ) , transforms these equations to @xmath122 and conditions ( [ cr2 ] ) to @xmath123 along with ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "their substitution into the  collision integral @xmath124 gives , similarly to ( [ cbh ] ) , @xmath125\\,\\ ,   \\,\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here again @xmath116 at @xmath117 but at @xmath118 action of the operator @xmath115 onto dfs is defined by boundary conditions ( [ crf ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ vnn0 ] ) as combined with boundary conditions ( [ cr2])-([mr ] ) at collision surfaces @xmath118 ( and conditions ( [ icv ] ) at infinity ) or , equivalently , equations ( [ fnn0 ] ) combined with ( [ crf ] ) and ( [ mr ] ) represent direct analogue of so - called `` hard - sphere bbgky hierarchy '' ( see e.g. eq.2.2 from @xcite or eq.4.1 from @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the term `` hard - sphere bbgky hierarchy '' is adequate on the understanding only that when the boundary conditions are substituted into @xmath126 inside the `` collision integral '' in equation for @xmath127 then * simultaneously and necessarily * they are satisfied by @xmath126 in the next equation for @xmath126 itself ( i.e. included into definition of the operators @xmath115 as above ) .",
    "otherwise one makes some `` mathematical non - physics '' , since resulting equations will be non - derivable from liouville equation for an ( infinitely ) many hard sphere system !    in opposite , fulfilment of the mentioned requirement guarantees observance of the virial relations ( see appendix ) and consequently belonging of resulting equations to the class of bbgky hierarchies ( since virial relations do follow already from most general properties of many - particle dynamics and liouville equations @xcite ) .    in view of these facts",
    ", it seems impossible to accept the old idea that under the boltzmann - grad limit ( bgl ) the `` hard - sphere bbgky hierarchy '' is equivalent to so - called `` hard - sphere boltzmann hierarchy '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for our system",
    "it looks as @xmath128\\,\\,\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where there are no forbidden regions , that is @xmath68 can take arbitrary values from the whole @xmath129 , and the boundary conditions ( [ crf ] ) at @xmath130 are thrown , that is operators @xmath115 are replaced by trivial translation operators , @xmath131 .",
    "this means that in corresponding equations for cfs any @xmath132 is now connected to @xmath120 only , and not to @xmath121 .",
    "thus , these equations form * two - diagonal * hierarchy * qualitatively different * from the original one !    as the result of such frivolity , these equations allow for factored solution with `` propagation of chaos '' , when @xmath133 , @xmath134 at @xmath86 . and @xmath135 undergoes the `` boltzmann - lorentz equation '' .",
    "evidently , this `` boltzmann hierarchy '' contraries to the above emphasized requirement : it uses the boundary conditions to write `` collision integrals '' but neglects the same conditions in higher equations what determine the integrands ( as if the latter took particles from a `` parallel world '' ) ! as the consequence , the boltzmann hierarchy does not satisfy the virial relations .",
    "its wrong is clear already from observation that it results when one first damages eqs.[fbh ] by replacing @xmath115 with @xmath131 and only after that goes to @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the famous lanford s attempt @xcite to prove the mentioned idea was in fact unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "possible formal cause of this nonsuccess is very simple : the smaller is @xmath50 the less smooth functions of @xmath68 are all the cfs @xcite , since conditions ( [ crf ] ) ensure continuity and smoothness of the probability measures @xmath36 along phase trajectories only but not in perpendicular dimensions .",
    "indeed , let @xmath137 , that is bp and an atom scatter one from another .",
    "if at that @xmath138 ( where @xmath139 denotes vector product ) , i.e. vectors @xmath140 and @xmath68 are nearly parallel , then the particles form an _ out_-state which ( almost certainly ) arose from their recent collision ( especially if @xmath141).according to ( [ cr2 ] ) , post - collision correlations of any order between such particles inevitably take place , and by order of magnitude all they are equal to @xmath72 . with time , as was explained in sec.3 , also quite similar pre - collision correlations do arise , at @xmath142 and again at @xmath143 , since statistical picture acquires more and more time - reversal symmetry .",
    "at the same time , at @xmath144 there are almost no reasons for correlations .",
    "hence , in directions perpendicular to @xmath140 all cfs become more and more sharp functions of @xmath68 . at that .",
    "the integral value of correlation per one atom goes to zero @xmath145 .",
    "but this has no significance since correlations concentrate just where they are most effective .",
    "this is confirmed by the virial relations ( [ intc ] ) .",
    "the latter show also that really significant correlational characteristics are @xmath146 which turn under bgl into singular generalized functions .",
    "we have seen that the boltzmann - grad limit does not lead to any essential simplifications ( and in this sense it does not exist ) . in particular",
    ", it does not lead to the mythologic botzmannian kinetics with boltzmann equation , boltzmann - lorentz equation , etc . ) , except non - interesting spatially homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "physical and statistical reasons of this pleasant fact already were over and over again explained in @xcite and earlier @xcite and later @xcite .",
    "the fact is pleasant because it shows once again that real many - particle dynamical chaos does not degenerates into miserable stochastics .",
    "integration of @xmath17-th of eqs.[vnn0 ] over @xmath147 and @xmath148 at @xmath149 yields for @xmath150 , in view of ( [ icv ] ) , equations @xmath151 at the same time , differentiation of eqs.[vnn0 ] in respect to the density produces for @xmath152 equations @xmath153 which are identical to the previous ones . since , according to ( [ icv ] ) , initial conditions for @xmath154 and @xmath155 also are identical ( all are zeros ) , we come to equalities @xmath156 , that is to the virial relations ( [ me ] ) , @xmath157 .",
    "notice that this consideration is valid regardless of concrete form of boundary conditions at @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , virial relations hold under replacement of the hard - sphere `` mirror reflection '' conditions ( [ mr ] ) by some other rule .",
    "correspondingly , equations ( [ vnn0 ] ) and ( [ fnn0 ] ) can be extended to collision operators @xmath159 with other `` scattering laws '' than ( [ mr ] ) .",
