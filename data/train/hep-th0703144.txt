    "in synthesis , the aforementioned four arguments lead to a conclusion that the gaussian type tachyon potential ( [ tpo ] ) fulfills the integration ( [ vco ] ) in the thin bps limit .",
    "in this section , we deal with the tachyon equation ( [ stq ] ) and discuss nonexistence of the monotonically - increasing nonsingular d - vortex solution connecting the boundary conditions at the origin , @xmath140 , and infinity , @xmath141 .",

    "the leading term is rapidly increasing since @xmath158 .",
    "comparison of the power series solutions near the origin ( [ rze ] ) and at the asymptotic region ( [ rinf ] ) suggests that smooth connection of both increasing tachyon profiles seems unlikely .",
