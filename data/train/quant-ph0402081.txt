    "in the course of signal and/or data processing fast classification of the input data is often helpful as a preprocessing step for decision preparation . assuming that the to be classified data @xmath0 is well defined and it came under a given number of classes or sets , @xmath1 . to perform the classification is in such a way equivalent to a set separation task .",
    "the problem of separation could be manifold : sparsely distributed input data makes the determination of the decision lines between the classes to a hard ( often nonlinear ) task , or even the probability distribution of the input data is not known a - priori which is resulted in an unsupervised classification problem also known as clustering @xcite . further `` open question '' is to classify input sequences in the case of only the original measurement / information data is known almost sure , but the observed system adds a stochastically changing behavior to it , in this manner the classification becomes a statistical decision problem , which could be extremely hard to solve if the number of `` possibilities '' is increasing . due to this fact to find an optimal solution is time consuming and yields broad ground to suboptimal ones .",

    "the smallest information conveying unit is the _",
    "bit_. the counterpart unit in quantum information is called the _ `` quantum bit '' _ , the qubit",
    ". its state can be described by means of the state @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 refers to the complex probability amplitudes and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the expression @xmath6 denotes the probability that after measuring the qubit it can be found in computational base @xmath7 , and @xmath8 shows the probability to be in computational base @xmath9 . in more general description an @xmath10-bit _ `` quantum register '' _ ( qregister ) @xmath2 is set up from qubits spanned by @xmath11 @xmath12 computational bases , where @xmath13 states can be stored in the qregisters at the same time @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath10 denotes the number of states and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that a transformation @xmath19 on a qregister is executed parallel on all @xmath10 stored states , which is called _",
    "quantum parallelizm_. to provide irreversibility of transformation , @xmath19 must be unitary @xmath20 , where the superscript @xmath21 refers to the hermitian conjugate or adjoint of @xmath19 .",
    "the quantum registers can be set in a general state using quantum gates @xcite which can be represented by means of a unitary operation , described by a quadratic matrix .",
    "for the sake of simplicity a 2-dimensional set separation is assumed , where the original source data can take the values @xmath22}$ ] and was chosen from the sets @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "additional information on the source is not available , e.g. also nothing about the probability density function ( _ pfd _ ) .",
    "the general set separation system is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : syst ] .",
    "the observed signal @xmath25 , disturbed by the system @xmath26 , becomes the input data which will be separated into the two sets ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) again .    in the set separator a quantum register @xmath2 as described by equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qreg]. is used to store all the parameters , e.g. delay , heat , velocity , etc .",
    "values of the possible system disturbance in a specially given quantization . as an example : in the qregister @xmath2 , the properly prepared , quantized delay and velocity values are stored , e.g. the values @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this information is not utilizable so far but the combination of this effects , i.e. this values , whose extent could blast any database . to handle the large amount of data to be processed a virtual database should be introduced .    to build up a virtual database a function @xmath29 is defined , where @xmath30 identifies the sets and @xmath31 denotes the index of the qregister @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath32 points to an record in the virtual database .",
    "the function @xmath34 is not obligingly mutual unambiguous consequently , it is not reversible , except for several special cases , when the virtual database contains @xmath35 only once . in this case",
    "the parameter settings of the system @xmath26 are easy to determine .",
    "nevertheless , the fact to have an entry only once in the virtual database described by the equation @xmath36 does not exclude to have the same entry in other virtual databases generated by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , which makes a trivial decision impossible .",
    "henceforth the fact should be kept in mind that @xmath34 is in almost every case a so called one way function which is easy to evaluate in one direction , but to estimate the inverse is rather hard .",
    "the function @xmath39 generates all the possible disturbances additional to the considered input value @xmath40 belonging to the set @xmath23 or @xmath24 of the system .",
    "this is of course a large amount of information , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the length of the qregister @xmath2 . for an example",
    "let us assume a 15-qbit qregister .",
    "the function @xmath33 in ( [ eq:2 ] ) generates @xmath43 output values at the same time for @xmath23 and the same number of outputs for @xmath24 .",
    "taking into account the large number of possible points in the set surface the optimal classification in a classical way becomes difficult .    , width=245,height=94 ]    at the first glace this problem looks more difficult to solve , however , with exploiting the enormous computational power of quantum computation , in this case the deutsch - jozsa @xcite quantum parallelization algorithm , an arbitrary unitary operation can be executed on all the prepared states contemporaneously .      roughly speaking the task is to find the entry ( entries ) in the virtual databases which is ( are ) equal to the observed data @xmath25 . to accomplish the database search the grover database search algorithm",
    "should be invoked @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : comp ] .",
    "we proposed to set up an qregister , which has to be built up only one time at all .",
    "it is obvious to choose a suitable database searching algorithm , to see which function @xmath45 picking the vector @xmath31 form qregister @xmath2 contains the searched _ bit _ , if any at all .",
    "we apply the optimal quantum search algorithm @xmath46 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : grover1 ] .",
    "proposed by grover @xcite .",
    "we feed the received signal @xmath47 to the oracle @xmath48 , where the function @xmath49@xmath50 is evaluated such that @xmath51        assuming , there is again @xmath52 solutions for the search in qregister @xmath2 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 consists of such configurations of @xmath11 , which does not results @xmath55 , while @xmath56 does .    because of the fact of tight bound , in real application less iterations would be also appropriate @xcite .",
    "let us turn our interest back to the separation of the observed data @xmath25 from the predefined sets .    assuming the special case where only one of the virtual database descriptor functions , either @xmath57 or @xmath58 contains the entry identical to the observed data @xmath25 a set separation can be performed easily .",
    "a more realistic case is to have an intersection part of the two sets as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : set2 ] .",
    "even so , due to passing the observed system , overlapping of the sets can be occurred due to disturbances . after evaluating the functions",
    "@xmath45 it could happen that the same records are multiple present , which shows the irreversibility behavior of the function ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "originally , the input signal was chosen from well defined disjunct sets without a - priori known probability distributions .",
    "the process , to put @xmath25 to a set either to @xmath59 or to @xmath60 should be based on _ maximum likelihood _ decision .",
    "let us assume that we have a random variable @xmath25 .",
    "its measured value depends on a selected element @xmath61 from a finite set ( @xmath62 ) and a process which can be characterized by means of a conditional pdf @xmath63 belonging to the given element .",
    "our task is to decide which @xmath61 was selected if a certain @xmath25 has been measured . each guess @xmath64 for @xmath61 can be regarded as a hypothesis .",
    "therefore decision theory is dealing with design and analysis of suitable rules building connections between the set of observations and hypotheses .",
    "if we are familiar with the unconditional ( a priori ) probabilities @xmath65 then the bayes formula helps us to compute the conditional ( a posteriori ) probabilities @xmath66 in the following way @xmath67 obviously the most pragmatic solution if one chooses @xmath64 belonging to the largest @xmath68 .",
    "this type of hypothesis testing is called _ maximum a posteriori _ ( map ) decision .",
    "if the a priori probabilities are unknown or @xmath61 is equiprobable then _ maximum likelihood _",
    "( ml ) decision can be used .",
    "it selects @xmath64 resulting the largest @xmath63 when the observed @xmath25 is substituted in order to minimize the probability of error        @xmath69 the maximum likelihood estimator requires to know the probability density function of the observed signal .",
    "employing the grover database search algorithm we are able to find the entries in the virtual databases , however , it is not needed to perform a complete search because the search result the exact index ( indices ) of the searched item(s) is ( are ) not interesting but the number how often a given configuration is involved in @xmath34 or not .",
    "for that purpose a new function @xmath70 is defined .",
    "the function @xmath71 counts the number of similar entries in the virtual database , which corresponds to the conditional probability density function @xmath25 to be in the set @xmath72 .",
    "for that reason it is worth stepping forward to quantum counting @xcite based on grover iteration .       and",
