    "the study of the nucleon and its excited states is an interesting topic in hadron physics . in classical constituent quark models ( cqm ) ,",
    "proton is described as a three - quark ( @xmath7 ) state .",
    "this picture is very successful in explaining the properties of the spatial ground states , but not for the case of the excited states . for example",
    ", the @xmath3 resonance , four - star state in the particle data review book ( pdg )  @xcite , with spin - parity @xmath8 , is expected to be the lowest @xmath9 orbital excited nucleon state  @xcite according to the cqm",
    ". however , the @xmath5 resonance is heavier than the spatial excited nucleon state , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is the long standing inverse mass problem for the low - lying excited nucleon states .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that @xmath3 resonance couples strongly to the final states with strangeness , such as , @xmath12 channel  @xcite , @xmath13 channel  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite , and @xmath15 channel  @xcite , which implies a considerable amount of @xmath16 component in the @xmath5 wave function  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath17 reaction is of particular interest in studying the structure of the @xmath5 resonance , of which the properties still bare a lot of controversies .",
    "since there are no isospin-@xmath18 @xmath19 baryons contributing here , this reaction gives us a rather clean platform to study the isospin @xmath20 nucleon resonances , especially for studying the @xmath5 resonance because it couples strongly to the @xmath21 channel .",
    "this reaction has been theoretically studied by using a chiral quark - model approach in refs .",
    "@xcite , and also in ref .",
    "@xcite with an updated coupled - channel method .",
    "they all found that the contributions from the @xmath5 resonance dominate the reaction near threshold .",
    "however , the present theoretical calculations are still far from being as accurate as the experiment  @xcite .",
    "thus , more theoretical studies are welcome .    along this line , with the near threshold experimental data  @xcite , we reanalysis the @xmath17 reaction from the production threshold to the center - of - mass energy @xmath22 gev by using the effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model .",
    "we payed especial attention to the role of the @xmath5 resonance , while the contribution of nucleon pole is also considered in the present calculation , and we find that the interference terms between the @xmath5 resonance and the nucleon pole are significant .",
    "moreover , in those previous works , they all take a constant total decay width , @xmath23 mev , for @xmath5 resonance . in this work , both the energy - dependent total width and the constant total width for the @xmath5 resonance are used .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we shall discuss the formalism and the main ingredients of the model .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "as shown in refs  @xcite , the combination of the effective lagrangian approach and the isobar model is a good method to study the hadron resonances production in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 scattering . in this work , we will use this approach to study the near threshold @xmath27 reaction .",
    "the basic tree level feynman diagrams for @xmath28 reaction are depicted in fig .  [ fig : feyndgm ] , where contributions from the @xmath1-channel and @xmath2-channel nucleon pole and @xmath3 ( @xmath29 ) resonance are considered .",
    "the contributions from the @xmath6-channel @xmath30 exchange are ignored , because the information of @xmath31 vertex is scarce and the mass of @xmath30 is heavy , which will suppress its contribution .     reaction . in these diagrams ,",
    "the contributions from @xmath1-channel and @xmath2-channel nucleon pole and @xmath5 resonance are considered .",
    "we also show the definitions of the kinematical ( @xmath32 ) those we use in our calculation . ]    to compute those terms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndgm ] , we take the effective lagrangian densities as @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 as used in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the values of coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be determined from the @xmath5 partial decay widths , @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the masses of proton , @xmath41 meson , @xmath42 meson , and @xmath5 resonance , respectively .",
    "the @xmath43 is the magnitude of the 3-momentum of @xmath44 meson that was measured in the @xmath5 resonance rest frame , and @xmath45 is the energy of proton in the @xmath46 or @xmath47 decay .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath45 have the following forms , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the kllen function with @xmath50 .    with experimental mass ( @xmath51 mev ) , total decay width ( @xmath23 mev ) , and the branch ratios of @xmath52(1535 ) resonance quoted in the pdg  @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "next , we pay attention to the total scattering amplitude @xmath55 of @xmath17 reaction , @xmath56    each amplitude can be obtained straightforwardly with the effective lagrangian densities shown above . here",
    "we give explicitly the amplitudes , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as an example , @xmath59 with @xmath60 , the invariant mass square of the @xmath61 system .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 [ @xmath64 and @xmath65 ] are respectively the form factor and propagator for the nucleon pole [ ( @xmath5 resonance ] .",
    "the form factors for nucleon pole and @xmath52(1535 ) resonance , @xmath62 and @xmath66 , are introduced to describe the off - shell properties of the amplitude , and we choose the forms of them as , @xmath67 with @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 gev as used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath70 reaction .    for the propagators @xmath63 and @xmath65 of the nucleon pole and the @xmath52(1535 ) resonance in the @xmath71channel , we take them as  @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath5 energy - dependent total decay width .",
    "since the main decay channels of @xmath5 resonance are the @xmath24 and @xmath12 , we take the commonly used phase space dependent width for the @xmath5 resonance as  @xcite , @xmath74 where @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 mev are the @xmath5 partial decay widths , the @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the phase space factors for @xmath24 and @xmath12 final states , respectively , for example , @xmath79    from the scattering amplitudes given above , we can calculate the total and differential cross sections for @xmath17 reaction . at the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame , the differential cross section for @xmath17 reaction can be expressed as , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the spin polarization variables of initial proton and final neutron , respectively .",
    "the @xmath83 is the angle of the outgoing @xmath42 meson relative to the beam direction in the c.m .",
    "frame , while @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the 3-momentum of the initial @xmath86 and the final @xmath42 mesons , respectively .",
    "firstly , with eq .  ( [ eq : dcs ] ) , we calculate the total and differential cross sections of @xmath0 reaction from the production threshold up to the center - of - mass energy @xmath87 gev by using the @xmath5 energy - dependent width as in eq .",
    "( [ gamr - ed ] ) .",
    "the corresponding theoretical results as well as the experimental data from refs .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcsed ] , where the dotted and dashed curves stand for the contributions from the nucleon pole and the @xmath5 resonance , respectively , while the solid line stands for the total contributions , which can describe well the experimental data with @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 gev .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : tcsed ] , we can see that the contributions from @xmath5 resonance are dominant , but not enough to reproduce the experimental data , whereas the contributions from the nucleon pole are minor , but , the interference terms of them are significant . we also find that the results are sensitive to the cutoff parameter , @xmath88 , but not to the cutoff parameter , @xmath89 , which is because the form factor for @xmath5 is close to @xmath90 with the invariant mass @xmath91 around @xmath51 mev in the present calculation .     for @xmath92 reaction with the energy - dependent @xmath93 .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves stand for the contributions from the nucleon pole and the @xmath5 resonance , respectively , while the solid line stands for the total contributions .",
    "the data are from ref .",
    "@xcite ( dot ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( square ) . ]    on the other hand , we also calculate the total cross section by using a constant total decay width @xmath94 mev for @xmath5 resonance , the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcsct ] . in this case , the contributions from the @xmath5 resonance are absolutely dominant , and the experimental data can be reasonably reproduced by only considering the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "the contributions from nucleon pole are minor and the interference terms are significant , which is the same as the case with the energy - dependent total decay width @xmath95 .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous calculations  @xcite .    from the results , dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcsed ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tcsct ] , we find that the breit - wigner mass of @xmath5 resonance will be pushed down if we use the energy - dependent width , which is similar to the case of @xmath96 state that we found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this will have important implications on various model calculations on the mass of @xmath5 resonance  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the differential cross section of the @xmath97 reaction with the energy - dependent total decay width @xmath95 for the @xmath5 resonance   is calculated and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcsed ] .",
    "we can see that our theoretical results can reasonably describe the experimental data , especially for those energy points near reaction threshold thanks to the main contributions from the @xmath5 resonance and the significant interference between the @xmath5 resonance and the nucleon pole .    , but for the case of @xmath94 mev .",
    "the @xmath17 reaction near - threshold is studied in the frame of the effective lagrangian method and the isobar model , which have been extensively used to deal with hadron collisions .",
    "we calculate the total and differential cross sections for this reaction by considering the contributions from the @xmath5 resonance and the nucleon pole . the energy - dependent total width and the constant total width for the @xmath5 resonance",
    "are used . in both cases ,",
    "the contributions from the @xmath5 resonance are absolutely dominant . in the case of the @xmath5 total decay width being @xmath23 mev ,",
    "the experimental data can be reasonably accounted for by only considering the n*(1535 ) resonance , which is in agreement with the previous calculations  @xcite .    from our results",
    ", it is shown that the @xmath1-channel @xmath3 resonance exchange plays the dominated role from the reaction threshold to the center - of - mass energy @xmath22 gev . the effect from nucleon pole",
    "is found to be small but the interference terms between the @xmath5 resonance and the nucleon pole are significant .",
    "we also find that the breit - wigner mass of @xmath5 resonance will be pushed down if we use the energy - dependent total width , which will have important implications on various model calculations on its mass .",
