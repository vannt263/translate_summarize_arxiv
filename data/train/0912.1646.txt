    "type ia supernovae ( sneia ) are currently the best cosmological tool to investigate the dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . though generally accepted as thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs which have accreted sufficient mass from their companion , two competitive models exist for the companion scenario : the single - degenerate ( main sequence or red giant companion ) and double - degenerate ( another white dwarf ) . since the time delay between star formation and sneia explosion is scenario - dependent , rates in hosts of varying star formation rate ( sfr ) help constrain this .",
    "in fact , snia rates are known to be correlated with host morphology , b - k color , and by inference also with star formation @xcite . as such , a galaxy s snia rate",
    "is commonly expressed as the sum of a `` delayed '' component from old stellar populations and a `` prompt '' component from young stellar populations .",
    "these components are parametrized as `` a '' and `` b '' , proportional to a galaxy s mass and sfr respectively @xcite .",
    "this `` a+b '' two - component model can be matched with progenitor populations that have distributions of delay times as described by mannucci et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and pritchet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the c99 catalog matched with very large array ( vla ) 1.4ghz radio data revealed the specific snia rate may be enhanced by 27 times in radio - loud ( @xmath3 ) over radio - quiet ( @xmath4 ) early - type galaxies ( della valle et al . 2005 , hereafter dv05 ) .",
    "although winds from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) could increase accretion rates of the interstellar medium ( ism ) onto white dwarfs , a process thought to trigger classical nova eruptions @xcite , dv05 reject this explanation for the enhanced specific snia rate in radio - loud galaxies .",
    "they find galaxy interactions are most likely to cause the radio emission and supply the necessary snia progenitors via stellar capture during dwarf accretion or star formation induced by major mergers @xcite .",
    "the existence of bright infrared counterparts for radio galaxies has been well documented and often attributed to dust obscured star formation coeval with the agn @xcite . by matching a hypothetical galaxy interaction and agn activity timeline with a recurring star formation model of ten @xmath5 year long episodes",

    "( 2006 ) find the enhanced specific snia rate in radio - loud early - type galaxies is best fit by a bimodal delay - time distribution ( dtd ) in which the `` prompt '' ( b ) delay time is constrained to just @xmath7 years .",
    "they suggest this implies two physical populations of snia progenitors , but note a broad single - population dtd could not be ruled out .",
    "as this controversial implication relies on a rate enhancement found with 21 photometrically identified sneia from dv05 , we look to confirm this in the large database of spectroscopically typed sneia from the canada - france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) supernova legacy survey ( snls ) .",
    "we use photometric redshift galaxy catalogs @xcite and 1.4 ghz radio catalogs to calculate the snia rate in radio - loud early - type galaxies , and also infrared source catalogs to look for obscured star formation in the radio - loud snia host galaxies .",
    "dust extinction in starbursts hinders sn detection : only one snia has been detected , and the snia rate remains unconstrained in starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use the infrared catalogs to calculate the snia rate in bright and luminous infrared galaxies , which are known to experience bursts of star formation up to @xmath8 .",
    "we also statistically compare the snia rates in radio and infrared galaxies to predictions of the two - component `` a+b '' model , and perform an identical analysis with the low redshift c99 catalog .    in   [ s2obs ]",
    "we describe the snls and c99 snia databases and galaxy catalogs , the overlapping radio and infrared source catalogs , and present the radio and infrared properties of snls and c99 snia early - type host galaxies .",

    "it may seem the two radio - loud snia host galaxies with sed type e / s0 ( normally quiescent ) and infrared counterparts must be agn dominated , but there are several reasons why this is not the case .",
    "first , the radio - loud e / s0 hosts do not lie along the `` agn plume '' of the irac color - color plot ( although 04d1jg and 05d1hn hosts are in its `` agn zone '' ) , and are outside the `` agn zone '' of the irac+mips color - color plot as shown in figure [ fs2ircc ] .",
    "second , agn - dominated infrared emission originates from a hot dusty torus tens of parsecs across @xcite and would be unresolved , but the infrared sources associated with these two galaxies have are flagged as extended .",
    "third , a visual inspection of radio and infrared snia hosts in @xmath77 and galex ( d2 only ) images show all but the late - type host of 06d2ff are quite faint to invisible in the ultraviolet , which can be indicative of dust obscured star formation .",
    "fourth , not all starbursts appear morphologically irregular ( e.g. figure 4.68 of binney & merrifield ( 1998 ) , in which a profoundly disturbed galaxy appears as an elliptical in a shallow exposure ) .",

    "we use radio luminosities derived in   [ ss2c99 ] to classify field galaxies , but initially use radio luminosities from dv05 to classify snia hosts in order to make a direct comparison with their results .",
    "we revise our results with our own luminosities and discuss in   [ ssratesradio ] and [ ssabpradio ] .      with snls data ,",
    "we find the specific snia rate in radio - loud early - type galaxies to be @xmath87 snum , within 1@xmath88 of the c99 result in table [ tsnrates ] .",
    "whereas dv05 quote a @xmath89 times snia rate enhancement in radio - loud over radio - quiet early - type galaxies , vla radio catalog incompleteness means we can identify only half of the radio - loud population (   [ ss2radio ] ) and can not isolate a radio - quiet set for the snls ( see figure [ fs2rlumvsz ] ) . in lieu of comparing with a radio - quiet set we consider the ratio between radio - loud and _ all _ early - types as a lower limit , and find it consistent with no enhancement at the 1@xmath88 and 2@xmath88 levels for the snls and c99 catalogs respectively , as shown in table [ tsnratios ] .",
    "can we correct our radio incompleteness , and does it affect our results ? while we could use radio - loud galaxy mass functions to estimate the mass missing from our radio - loud sample , we could not know how many snia this mass hosted , so can not correct the snia rates for radio incompleteness . instead",

    "the snia rate is not expected to be proportional to @xmath90 because agn activity is not suspected of directly influencing the probability of an snia explosion , as discussed in   [ s1intro ] ; any evolution in the physical properties of agn is not expected to influence our results either .",
    "our radio incompleteness is thus unlikely to affect our results - they are a suitable comparison sample to c99 .    as an extra test , we present the specific snia rates amongst the `` radio - loudest '' ( @xmath80 ) early - type galaxies in table [ tsnrates ] , and their ratio over all early - types in table [ tsnratios ] . unlike the radio - loud ,",
    "the radio - loudest sample from snls catalogs is complete to @xmath72 .",
    "while the snls snia rate in the radio - loudest early - type galaxies shows no increase over the rate in all early - types , the c99 catalog shows a @xmath91 enhancement which is twice that for the radio - loud sample .",
    "however , this is within 3@xmath88 of a null result , and additional factors may artificially inflate this rate as discussed below .",
    "although we do not recover precisely the same radio luminosities for c99 early - type hosts as dv05 , we have initially used their classifications in order to directly compare with their results . as shown in table [ tdve ]",
    ", we would place ngc 1316 in the radio - loud subset but not the radio - loudest , and would not classify ngc 3106 as `` borderline '' radio - loud .",

    "two snls sneia found in radio - loud _ late_-type hosts , 05d1by and 06d2ff , have stretch values consistent with the `` b '' and `` a '' component distributions respectively which is normal since late - types have an underlying old stellar population .",

    "in general we find the properties of radio and infrared snia hosts , and their environments , to resemble dusty starburst galaxies (   [ ss2hostradioir ] ) , and expect their snia light curves to be reddened and extinguished .",
    "snls analysis finds 05d1by , 05d1hn , 06d2ff , and 04d2bt are particularly red , and the first three have large hubble residuals , indicating this is an unusually red , faint sample of sneia .",

    "it is similar to sn 2001ay @xcite , which had an atypically slow light curve decline given its unremarkable peak magnitude , a very luminous near - ir magnitude at @xmath164 days post maximum , and an early - type host@xcite .",
    "such peculiar spectra comprise @xmath165 of all sneia , but in this small sample it is impossible to comment on whether they are more or less common in active galaxies .",

    "for the first time , we have incorporated infrared star formation rates into the two - component `` a+b '' model .",
    "while it does slightly increase the number of snia predicted , more so in b / lirg than in radio - loud(est ) samples , ultimately _ all _ snls results are consistent with the two - component `` a+b '' model .",
    "the same can not initially be said for all c99 results , but the observed number of c99 sneia may be an upper limit due to snia and/or host misclassifications .",

    "curved lines show the two - component `` a+b '' model from sullivan et al .",
    "although error bars are large and all rates are within @xmath2 of the optical `` a+b '' model , when plotted with @xmath167 the snls snia rates in b / lirg and radio - loud(est ) subsets do align more closely with `` a+b '' .",
    "the same can be said for c99 b / lirg , and the apparent discrepancy for the c99 radio - loud(est ) subset may be due to misclassifications discussed in   [ ssratesradio ] .",
    "these results are not significant , but are included to demonstrate the utility of such an analysis for future snia rates .",
    "dv05 suggested the snia rate enhancement in radio - loud early - type galaxies may be due to galaxy mergers triggering radio activity and providing extra snia progenitors by induced star formation .",
    "some aspects of the snls data are consistent with this : the evidence for dust - obscured star formation in snia radio hosts , the agreement between observations and `` a+b '' model predictions in snia radio hosts , and the properties of snia in radio hosts being similar to those associated with intermediate age stellar populations",

    "<S> we have combined the large snia database of the canada - france - hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey and catalogs of galaxies with photometric redshifts , vla 1.4 ghz radio sources , and spitzer infrared sources . </S>",
    "<S> we present eight sneia in early - type host galaxies which have counterparts in the radio and infrared source catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> we find the snia rate in subsets of radio and infrared early - type galaxies is @xmath015 times the rate in all early - type galaxies , and that any enhancement is always @xmath1 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> rates in these subsets are consistent with predictions of the two component `` a+b '' snia rate model . since infrared properties of radio snia hosts indicate dust obscured star formation , we incorporate infrared star formation rates into the `` a+b '' model . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the properties of sneia in radio and infrared galaxies suggest the hosts contain dust and support a continuum of delay time distributions for sneia , although other delay time distributions can not be ruled out based on our data . </S>"
