    "early works studied optical materials with the kerr ( cubic ) nonlinearity which exhibit stable fundamental ( single - hump ) solitons in one spatial dimension @xcite and collapse in two and three spatial dimensions @xcite . later works focused on optical materials with saturable nonlinear response such as photorefractive crystals ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "first , it follows from fig .",
    "[ eigenvalue ] for @xmath114 that the eigenvalues @xmath137 at @xmath182 merge into the continuous spectrum at @xmath200 , while unstable eigenvalues appear at @xmath201 .",
    "our numerical results are inconclusive as to what happens in the narrow interval @xmath202 .",
    "this problem is left open for future studies . and",
    "second , when @xmath7 is further away from the cut - off frequency @xmath38 , the vector vortex solution bifurcates into scalar vortex solutions with @xmath203 and @xmath204 , see @xcite .",
    "the scalar vortex soliton has additional unstable eigenmodes at @xmath205 which have smaller growth rates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we do not study this bifurcation where the family of vector vortex solitons terminates , nor the number of unstable eigenvalues of vector vortex solitons near this bifurcation .      to study the linear stability of the dipole solitons ( [ dipole ] ) , we linearize the system ( [ e1])([e2 ] ) with the perturbation : @xmath206,\\ ] ] @xmath207.\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath208 and @xmath209 are complex functions and are very small .",
    "the linearization problem is then written in the form : @xmath210 where @xmath211 the linearized problem can be formulated in the same hamiltonian form ( [ lphi ] ) with the energy quadratic form @xcite : @xmath212 at the cut - off frequency @xmath37 , the same analysis as for the vortex solitons shows existence of a pair of eigenvalues @xmath165 with negative values of @xmath131 and a number of zero eigenvalues with zero values of @xmath131 . we show again that the eigenvalues @xmath165 with negative energy never bifurcate into complex domain for @xmath171 . indeed , for any @xmath7 value , the linearization problem ( [ linear11])([linear14 ] ) has the exact solution @xmath213 at @xmath175 , and @xmath214 at @xmath178 .",
    "we study the zero eigenvalues of the system ( [ linear11])([linear14 ] ) with perturbation series expansions for @xmath171 : @xmath215 here @xmath67 is the same small parameter as in expansions ( [ uexpand])([lambdaexpand ] ) , while the functions @xmath216 are linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the null space of the problem ( [ linear11])([linear14 ] ) at @xmath37 : @xmath217 where @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 are constants . substituting ( [ perturbationuw1 ] ) into the system ( [ linear11])([linear14 ] ) , we find an exact solution at order @xmath67 : @xmath222 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 solve the problems ( [ u20 ] ) and ( [ u22 ] ) . at order @xmath73 ,",
    "four solvability conditions are needed for solving the non - homogeneous equations for @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "( [ lambda2 ] ) , we transform the four solvability conditions to the form : @xmath225 if @xmath226 , then @xmath227 , while @xmath219 , @xmath220 are arbitrary constants .",
    "thus , the zero eigenvalue persists in the system ( [ linear11])([linear14 ] ) for @xmath171 with two eigenfunctions @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "the two eigenfunctions are related to the symmetries of the system ( [ e1])([e2 ] ) with respect to rotation in @xmath230 and shift of the complex phase . if @xmath231 however , the system ( [ dipolesigma2 ] ) has only the trivial solution : @xmath232 .",
    "therefore , the other two zero eigenvalues do not bifurcate to the imaginary axis but simply disappear for @xmath171 .",
    "we have analytically proved above that the dipole solitons are linearly stable in the neighborhood of the cut - off frequency @xmath38 . moreover ,",
    "contrary to vortex solitons , there are only two eigenvalues of negative energy for @xmath171 , and they remain on the imaginary axis for all @xmath7 values [ see ( [ embeddedeigenvalue1 ] ) and ( [ embeddedeigenvalue11 ] ] .",
    "thus , we conjecture that the dipole solitons are linearly stable in the whole domain of their existence .",
    "this conjecture is in agreement with the numerical work of @xcite .",
    "we again confirm this result by numerical simulations of the system ( [ e1])([e2 ] ) linearized around the dipole soliton ( [ dipole ] ) . for @xmath53 ,",
    "we have simulated the linearized system for several values of @xmath7 between @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "we did not find any instability in the linearized system . since @xmath235 is close to the cut - off frequency @xmath112 and @xmath236",
    "is close to the end frequency @xmath19 , we conclude that dipole solitons are indeed linearly _",
    "stable _ in the whole existence interval .",
    "here we study the nonlinear evolution of perturbed vortex solitons .",
    "the unstable vortex soliton under small random - noise perturbations was found in @xcite to break up into a rotating dipole vector soliton .",
    "we will show below that such a breakup scenario holds only when the vortex component of the vortex soliton is below certain threshold . above that threshold ,",
    "unstable vortex solitons break up into two rotating fundamental vector solitons instead .",
    "we will also show that the vortex solitons with small vortex components are not only linearly but also nonlinearly stable .",
    "we consider first the nonlinear evolution of linearly stable vortex solitons .",
    "for this purpose , we have simulated the system ( [ e1])([e2 ] ) starting with a linearly - stable vortex soliton under various types of small initial perturbations such as random - noise and deterministic ones .",
    "we have found that the vortex solitons are also nonlinearly stable for all small perturbations . to demonstrate , we select @xmath53 and @xmath237 , where the vortex soliton has been shown to be linearly stable ( see fig .",
    "[ eigenvalue ] ) . as initial perturbations ,",
    "we choose @xmath238 where @xmath239 is a small perturbation parameter , that measures amplification of the vortex soliton by a factor @xmath240 .",
    "the simulation result with @xmath241 is shown in fig .",
    "[ stablevortex ] .",
    "this figure shows that the perturbed vortex soliton persists the nonlinear evolution and exhibits little change of shape even after 300 diffraction lengths .",
    "this clearly confirms the linear and nonlinear stability of the vortex soliton with @xmath53 and @xmath237 .",
    "other perturbations to this soliton give similar evolution results .",
    "we study next the nonlinear evolution of linearly unstable vortex solitons .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ section3a ] that these solitons possess two unstable eigenmodes @xmath139 and @xmath140 with @xmath196 .",
    "the @xmath137 versus @xmath7 graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ eigenvalue ] for @xmath114 , while unstable eigenfunctions @xmath242 for @xmath114 and @xmath243 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ unstablemodes ] . however , we recognize that these two unstable eigenmodes are equivalent in view of eqs .",
    "( [ e1perturb ] ) and ( [ e2perturb ] ) .",
    "thus , any small initial perturbation to the vortex soliton is projected onto this unstable eigenmode which grows exponentially , while the rest of the initial perturbation disperses away . for convenience ,",
    "we choose the initial perturbation to be exactly this unstable eigenmode , i.e. , @xmath244 @xmath245,\\ ] ] where @xmath239 is a small perturbation parameter .",
    "the advantage of this special perturbation is that it shortens the distance for the breakup of the vortex soliton and reduces the radiation noise in the nonlinear evolution of the perturbed solution .",
    "we have discovered two breakup scenarios of the unstable vortex soliton with the initial perturbation ( [ ic2a])([ic2b ] ) .",
    "we confirm that unstable vortex solitons with relatively _ small _ vortex components indeed break up into a rotating dipole soliton , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however , when the vortex component increases above a certain threshold , an unstable vortex soliton breaks up into two rotating _",
    "fundamental _ vector solitons rather than one dipole soliton .",
    "for example , when @xmath53 and @xmath246 , the vortex soliton breaks up into a dipole soliton when @xmath247 , and into two fundamental vector solitons when @xmath248 . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath249 ( where the vortex component is relatively small ) , the time evolution of the perturbed vortex soliton is plotted in fig . [ unstablevortex1 ] .",
    "it is seen that this soliton breaks up into a rotating dipole soliton .",
    "but when @xmath195 ( where the vortex component is bigger ) , the time evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ unstablevortex2 ] . here",
    "two rotating fundamental vector solitons are formed after the breakup of the unstable vortex soliton .",
    "we have also found that these breakup scenarios are insensitive to the type of initial perturbation imposed , because we have simulated the evolutions with different values of @xmath239 in ( [ ic2a ] ) and ( [ ic2b ] ) as well as with other forms of initial perturbations such as random noise , but the breakup scenarios do not change . to check the numerical accuracy of our simulations ,",
    "we have used more grid points and wider @xmath10 intervals and obtained identical results .",
    "furthermore , our results conserve energies of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components very well .    intuitively , it is not difficult to understand the above two breakup scenarios of unstable vortex solitons .",
    "when the vortex component of the vortex soliton is small , the instability ( with @xmath196 ) breaks up the vortex ( @xmath6 ) component into two weak humps , while it does not significantly affect the single - hump shape of the fundamental ( @xmath5 ) component since @xmath5 s initial amplitude is much higher . during the subsequent evolution ,",
    "the two humps of the @xmath6 component are too weak to break the @xmath5 component into two pieces , thus the solution relaxes into a dipole soliton instead of two fundamental solitons . however ,",
    "when the vortex component of the vortex soliton is sufficiently large , the fundamental component becomes small ( see fig .",
    "[ vortexfig ] and @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", instability breaks up both the vortex and fundamental components into two pieces , and two fundamental solitons are formed then .",
    "to summarize , we have studied both analytically and numerically the existence , uniqueness , and stability of vortex and dipole vector solitons in saturable optical materials in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "we have shown that the analytical expressions for vortex and dipole vector solitons can be constructed with perturbation series expansions near the cut - off frequency @xmath37 .",
    "we have also shown that only two vector solitons bifurcate from the same cut - off frequency , which are vortex and dipole solitons .",
    "furthermore , we have proved that both vortex and dipole solitons are linearly _ stable _ when the vortex and dipole components are _ small_. as the vortex and dipole components increase , the family of vortex vector solitons becomes linearly unstable , while that of dipole vector solitons remains linearly stable in the entire existence domain .",
    "we have also shown that unstable vortex solitons break up into a rotating dipole soliton only when the vortex component is relatively small .",
    "when the vortex component crosses a certain threshold , the vortex soliton breaks up into two rotating fundamental vector solitons instead .",
    "we expect that our results are significant not only for studies of spatial vector solitons in a saturable nonlinear medium but also for studies of bose - einstein condensation .    in this paper ,",
    "we have studied only the simplest vortex and dipole vector solitons which bifurcate from the fundamental @xmath23 and small @xmath24 components .",
    "one natural question to ask is the existence and stability of other vortex and multi - pole vector solitons .",
    "the perturbation series expansion method developed in this paper is powerful for a systematic study of general vortex and multi - pole vector solitons near their bifurcation points . but",
    "this problem lies outside the scope of the present article .",
    "we note , however , that vortex solitons ( [ vortex ] ) with @xmath250 and @xmath251 exist , and they are expected to be linearly always unstable because each component has non - zero charge and is linearly unstable by itself @xcite .",
    "this expectation is consistent with our preliminary numerical simulations on vortex solitons with charges such as @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "recently , three - component vortex and dipole vector solitons in a saturable medium have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the authors found that those solitons are linearly unstable provided their total topological charge is non - zero . in view of our results in this paper ,",
