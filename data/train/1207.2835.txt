    "gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are the brightest phenomena in the universe .",
    "long - soft type grbs are considered to originate from deaths of massive stars such as wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars @xcite .",
    "the most widely accepted scenario for long grbs is the collapsar scenario @xcite . in this model , after the gravitational collapse of a massive stellar core , a black hole and an accretion disk system is formed and it launches a relativistic jet by magnetic field or neutrino pair annihilation process . if the jet can break out the stellar envelope successfully , a grb is raised by converting the jet kinetic energy into the radiation energy .    owing to their brightness and detections at high redshift universe , grbs are expected to be one of the powerful tools to probe the early universe .",
    "the development of observational instruments and early follow - up systems enable us to discover some high redshift grbs .",
    "the most distant one ever is grb 090429b at @xmath11 @xcite and grb 090423 at @xmath12 ( e.g. @xcite ) follows it .",
    "if grbs can be raised by first stars and detected , we will draw informations about the early universe , e.g. , the star formation history and the reionization history .",
    "first stars in the universe , so called population iii  ( pop iii ) stars , are considered to be formed from metal free gas in the very early universe .",
    "the metal - free primordial gas cools less efficiently compared to the metal - contained present - day gas , which allows the primordial gas to have larger fragmentation masses . since it was considered that the whole fragmented gas clump collapsed to form a single star , pop iii stars",
    "were theoretically predicted to be very massive @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies suggest that this is not always the case and that a massive gas clump can experience further fragmentation to form a binary system @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the uv radiation from the central protostar can ionize the surrounding neutral gas and suppress the accretion onto the protostar .",
    "they analytically investigated this feed back effect on the protostar evolution and found that pop iii stars finally obtain mass typically @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed two - dimensional simulations of the protostar evolution including the above feed back effect and found that pop iii stars finally obtain masses typically @xmath15 .",
    "they also concluded that the uv radiation from the central star eventually stops the mass accretion and the growth of the star by the evaporation of the surrounding gas .",
    "it is considered that metal free pop iii stars do not lose mass , keeping large hydrogen envelopes until the pre - supernova stage , because of the low opacity envelopes @xcite .",
    "the final fate of a pop iii star depends on the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "after the stellar core collapse , those pop iii stars in the range of @xmath16 would explode as supernovae and form neutron stars as remnants .",
    "those in @xmath17 form black holes as remnants after the fall back accretion of the envelopes onto the temporally formed neutron stars .",
    "more massive stars ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) would fail to blow out their envelopes and promtoly form massive black holes , except those stars in @xmath20 who end as pair - instability supernovae due to the explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "these remnant massive black holes are expected to raise various violent phenomena @xcite .",
    "there have been some studies about the productivity of grbs from massive pop iii stars ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "the former two studies assumed a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk as an outcome of a massive stellar collapse , and estimated the accretion rate onto the black hole .",
    "then they evaluated the jet luminosity and showed that the burst activity of a pop iii star is observable by current detectors . in @xcite , they analytically studied the jet propagation in the stellar envelope and showed that massive pop iii stars ( @xmath22 ) can produce grbs although they have large hydrogen envelopes , since the long lasting accretion provides enough energy and time for the successful jet breakout .",
    "in addition , @xcite performed two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in which the accretion onto a black hole and the jet production are treated in a self - consistent way for stellar models of massive pop iii stars ( @xmath23 ) , wolf - rayet stars ( initially @xmath24 ) , and low mass pop iii stars ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "they confirmed the validity of the analytic results in @xcite and also found that @xmath26 pop iii stars can be progenitors of grbs , but did not study their observational characteristics and detectability .",
    "the idea of grbs from blue super giants ( bsg ) was suggested in @xcite .",
    "although they considered the jet dynamics in the stellar envelope , they treated a steady jet and did not reflect the central engine activity caused by the change of the accretion rate .",
    "they did not evaluate the possibility of grbs from bsgs quantitatively . on the other hand , @xcite discussed gamma - ray transients from pop iii bsg collapsars by investigating the mass accretion of the outermost layers of a star , but did not discuss the jet propagation and the jet break out .",
    "assuming that the conversion efficiency of the accretion energy to the radiation energy @xmath27 , they found that pop iii bsgs can produce long gamma - ray transients with duration @xmath28 sec and luminosity @xmath29 erg @xmath30 . in this paper , we simultaneously investigate both aspects ( the jet propagation and the central engine activity ) in a self - consistent way by including the following physical processes ; the stellar collapse , the non - steady jet injection , and the jet propagation in the stellar envelope . by doing this ,",
    "we quantitatively discuss the possibility of the jet break out and grb especially for low mass pop iii stars ( around @xmath31 ) .    in  2 , after introducing the stellar models and the jet propagation models , we investigate the productivity of a grb focusing on a @xmath31 pop iii star , which is a pop iii star with the typical mass reported by the state - of - the - art simulation done in @xcite . in  3 , we calculate the observational characters , such as the duration @xmath32 , the peak luminosity @xmath33 and the spectrum peak energy in the observer frame @xmath34 , of grbs from @xmath26 pop iii progenitors .",
    "then we evaluate the detectability of such pop iii grbs by future detectors such as _ lobster _ and _ exist _ in detail , varying the redshift of a burst .",
    "we apply the above discussions to different progenitor models with masses of @xmath35 . in the last part of",
    " 3 , we evaluate the light curves of pop iii grb radio afterglow emissions and their detectability by the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the expanded very large array ( evla ) .  4 is devoted to the summary and discussions .",
    "we employ a pre - collapse stellar model of z40.0 by @xcite , which provides the structure of a @xmath26 with zero metallicity at the final phase of the stellar evolution .",
    "it is considered that a @xmath36 pop iii star promptly forms a black hole after the core collapse @xcite .",
    "then we consider the subsequent evolution of the stellar collapse and the jet propagation in the stellar envelope following the similar prescription to @xcite .",
    "we first assume that the collapse proceeds in a spherically symmetric manner without pressure support so that each mass shell of the star within mass [ @xmath37 and radius [ @xmath38 falls into the central core in the free - fall time scale @xmath39 .",
    "we calculate the mass accretion rate from the expression @xmath40 . when the mass of the central core becomes @xmath41",
    ", we identify that a black hole is formed since the maximum possible mass of a neutron star is @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "after the formation of the black hole , we assume that a cold relativistic jet with a constant opening angle @xmath43 has been launched and we take this moment as the origin of time ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "there are mainly two candidates for the jet production mechanisms , i.e. , the neutrino annihilation process and the magnetic process . in @xcite , they showed that the jet model based on the neutrino annihilation process is not appropriate for producing grbs from very massive pop iii stars .",
    "accordingly we adopt the jet model based on the magnetic process . in this model ,",
    "the jet injection luminosity @xmath45 is considered to be represented as @xmath46 ( see @xcite and references there in ) , where the constant @xmath47 is an energy conversion efficiency and we take the value of @xmath48 .",
    "this is a calibrated value so as for wolf - rayet stars to reproduce the energetics of canonical local long grbs , i.e. , nearly @xmath49 ergs of energy should be injected into the relativistic jet after the breakout .    in this paper",
    "it looks like that we neglect the effect of the stellar rotation and treat the stellar collapse in spherically symmetric way . according to @xcite ,",
    "when the stellar rotation is taken into consideration , the accretion time scale onto the central bh for each mass shell @xmath50 can be represented as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the standard dimensionless viscosity parameter of the disk . as described in @xcite",
    ", we regard that this uncertain factor is absorbed within the calibrated parameter @xmath47 . therefore , we think that the disk formation is implicitly taken into account and that the spherically symmetric prescription makes sense .    in the following sections , we consider the propagation of a jet in the stationary stellar envelope .",
    "for the @xmath26 pop iii model , the he core mass @xmath53 and the he core radius @xmath54 are @xmath55 and @xmath56 cm , respectively .",
    "therefore , the collapse time scale of the he core is estimated as @xmath57 sec . on the other hand , the time scale for the jet head to reach the outer edge of the he core can be evaluated as @xmath58 sec , since we can see that the average velocity of the jet head within the he core is @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath60 holds .",
    "we confirm that this inequality holds better in outer layers and that calculations based on the stationary envelope is self consistent .",
    "first , we consider the propagation of a jet in the stellar envelope . as pointed out in the previous subsection , we approximate that the stellar envelope is stationary and that the density profile is the same as that in the pre - supernova stage until the jet break out .",
    "a jet propagating through the stellar envelope forms forward and reverse shocks at its head . here , we assume that the separation between these shocks is small compared to the distance from the stellar center . from the continuity of the momentum flux at the jet head , we have @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the density , the specific enthalpy , lorentz factor , the velocity divided by the speed of light @xmath64 , and the pressure , respectively .",
    "the subscripts j , h and @xmath65 stand for the jet , the jet head and the stellar envelope , respectively .",
    "we consider a cold jet so that we can neglect @xmath66 in l.h.s . of eq . .",
    "in r.h.s . of eq . , we can approximate @xmath67 and neglect @xmath68 , since stellar material is non - relativistic",
    ". then the velocity of the jet head ( @xmath69 ) is expressed as @xmath70^{1/2}\\right]^{-1 } , \\label{eq : betah}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 refer to the jet luminosity and the position of the jet head , respectively .",
    "we use the formula @xmath73 in calculating eq . .",
    "accordingly , the position of the jet head is calculated as @xmath74 .",
    "the jet head consists of shocked stellar matter and shocked jet material .",
    "they are relativistically hot and expand sideways of the jet forming a cocoon .",
    "we assume that almost all the jet energy goes through the shocked region into the cocoon during the jet propagating in the stellar envelope .",
    "the cocoon expands laterally by balancing its pressure with the ram pressure of the stellar matter as @xmath75 where the subscript c refers to the cocoon and @xmath76 is assumed .",
    "since the cocoon consists of relativistically hot materials , @xmath77 can be expressed as @xmath78 , using the cocoon volume @xmath79 and the cocoon energy @xmath80 .",
    "now , we suppose the shape of the cocoon as a cone , then @xmath81 . in our jet model",
    ", the cocoon energy can be expressed as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the mass accreted to the black hole by the time @xmath84 . substituting all these expressions into eq .",
    ", the cocoon expansion velocity @xmath85 can be calculated as @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "then the position of the cocoon edge is given as @xmath88 .",
    "now we discuss whether pop iii stars can raise grbs by following the time evolution of the positions of the jet head and the cocoon edge .",
    "if the jet head reaches the stellar surface earlier than the cocoon edge , we consider that the star can raise a grb since we can expect a successful jet breakout . on the other hand , if the cocoon edge reaches the stellar surface earlier , we can expect that the mass accretion is suppressed and that the relativistic jet is stalled on the way .",
    "this looks like a failed grb .",
    "[ fig : vel ] shows the time evolution of the jet head velocity @xmath69 ( the red solid line ) and the cocoon velocity @xmath85 ( the green dashed line ) . in this figure",
    ", the time variability of velocities comes from the discontinuity of the stellar density profile and the mass accretion rate .",
    "as pointed out in e.g. , @xcite , we can see that the jet head accelerates drastically after entering the hydrogen envelope .",
    "in addition , we find that the jet head propagates faster than the cocoon edge all the way through the stellar envelope except for the very early time .",
    "we also find that the jet head breaks out of the stellar envelope @xmath89 sec after the central engine is activated .",
    "thus , we conclude that a @xmath36 pop iii star has the possibility to raise a grb .",
    "note here that @xmath90 pop iii stars are thought to end their lives as blue super giants ( bsg ) , keeping large hydrogen envelopes with radii @xmath91 cm .",
    "this is because the opacity is too low to induce the mass loss from metal free stellar envelopes @xcite . in general , the progenitor of a local long grb is not considered to be a super giant star with a hydrogen or helium envelope but to be a wolf - rayet star with no hydrogen or helium envelope and radius @xmath92 cm .",
    "the observational reason is that every supernovae associating with long grbs belongs to type ibc .",
    "theoretically , it is considered that a super giant star has a too largely extended envelope for the jet to break out successfully @xcite and it can not raise a grb . from the results here , however , we confirm that a bsg ( @xmath91 cm ) is compact enough for a successful jet breakout .",
    "we should note that @xcite and @xcite have suggested the possibility of grbs or gamma - ray transients from bsgs .",
    "however the former treated a steady jet and did not quantitatively evaluate the possibility , while the latter focused on the formation of the accretion disk around the bh and did not discuss the jet break out . in this section",
    "we quantitatively confirm the possibility of grbs from bsgs by consistently considering the stellar collapse , non - steady jet injection , and the jet propagation .",
    "in this section , we consider observational characters of pop iii grbs .",
    "we assume that soon after the jet breakout , the jet emission can be seen as a grb and the burst lasts until the whole stellar envelope accretes completely .",
    "we suppose that the efficiency for converting the jet energy to the radiation energy is 10 % .",
    "accordingly , we can calculate expected properties of the burst , such as the peak luminosity ( @xmath93 ) , duration ( @xmath94 ) and the isotropic energy ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "note here that we estimate the @xmath94 as the period during which 90 % of the burst s energy is emitted .",
    "furthermore , we evaluate the time - integrated spectrum using empirical laws for grbs .",
    "there are some correlations which hold between the time - integrated spectral peak energy in the observer frame ( @xmath34 ) and the peak luminosity ( @xmath93 ) or the isotropic energy ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "one is the @xmath4 correlation @xcite and the other is the @xmath97 correlation @xcite .",
    "the functional forms of these two correlations are represented as    @xmath98^{2.0 } , \\label{eq : yonetoku}\\ ] ]    @xmath99 \\sim 80 \\left[\\frac{e_{\\rm \\gamma , iso}}{10^{52}\\ { \\rm erg } } \\right]^{0.57 } , \\label{eq : amati}\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "table [ tab : popiiigrb ] shows the results of our model for a @xmath90 pop iii star . as can be seen from table [ tab : popiiigrb ] , pop iii grbs radiate as much energy ( @xmath100 erg ) as the most energetic local long grbs do , while @xmath101 is smaller by a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , the duration ( @xmath103 sec ) of pop iii grbs is much longer than that of local long grbs .",
    "star as @xmath104 sec in the grb frame , but this is a wrong value .",
    "we find that the correct value is @xmath105 sec in the grb frame , which is similar to the one obtained here ( @xmath106 sec in the grb frame ) .",
    "this is because the larger mass of the @xmath107 pop iii star compensates with its larger radius ( @xmath108 cm ) , as we can see from the expression of the free - fall time . ]",
    "all these differences come from the fact that although the progenitor of a local long grb has no hydrogen envelope and is more compact , a pop iii progenitor has a large hydrogen envelope .",
    "since a pop iii star experiences no mass loss and keeps a more massive hydrogen envelope , the energy supply to the central engine can last longer time .",
    "this enables the central engine to be kept active for much longer time .",
    "this also enables the burst to have a much longer duration and to have the vast isotropic energy . on the other hand , it takes longer time for the jet to break out the larger stellar envelope and the jet energy after the breakout is more damped .",
    "this causes the pop iii grbs to have lower luminosities .",
    "we evaluate the observed peak energy for either the case that the @xmath4 correlation holds or that the @xmath8 correlation does . for the case of @xmath4 correlation ,",
    "@xmath109 kev is in the x - ray region , whereas for the @xmath8 correlation , the peak energy in the grb frame is larger than that of a local long grb , because of the larger @xmath110 value .",
    "however , the cosmological redshift effect reduces the peak down to @xmath111 kev , which is slightly softer than that of a local long grb .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the detectability of pop iii grbs . in @xcite",
    ", they found that pop iii grbs are too dim to trigger _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",
    "we obtain the similar conclusion even we employ the different progenitor from them .",
    "therefore , we here discuss whether pop iii grbs trigger the future satellite missions such as _ lobster _ @xcite and _ exist _ in detail .",
    "while _ lobster _ will have energy window range of @xmath112 kev , _ exist _ will have that of @xmath113 kev .",

    "_ lobster _ is more appropriate for detecting pop iii grbs .",
    "recently , studied the time dependent spectral characteristics of several individual bright grbs .",
    "they found that the isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath127 correlates with the time resolved spectrum peak energy @xmath136 for each grb and that the functional form of the correlation is very similar to the time integrated @xmath4 correlation ( eq . ) .",
    "note that they calculated the time resolved spectrum by integrating the signal flux within 1 sec time bin around each time .",
    "accordingly , if we assume the validity of the time - resolved @xmath137 correlation , which is obtained by replacing @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "by @xmath127 and @xmath138 , we can discuss the detectability using the condition in eq . .",

    "@xcite and @xcite studied the mass of a pop iii star at its birth by calculating the evolution of a primordial protostar in analytical or numerical way .",
    "because the initial angular momentum of a primordial gas cloud is considered to be large enough , in the star formation phase , a protostar and a circumstellar accretion disk system is formed and the protostar gains mass by the accretion of the surrounding gas through the disk .",
    "they found that the uv radiation from the protostar eventually stops the mass accretion and the growth of the star by evaporating the surrounding gas and eventually the disk .",
    "they also found that the final mass of a pop iii star depends on the degree of the angular momentum transport within the accretion disk and on the magnitude of the initial angular momentum of a gas cloud . in @xcite , the degree of the angular momentum transport",
    "is characterized by the @xmath169-parameter of the disk , where the larger @xmath169 value means the larger mass accretion . in fig .",
    "s1 of @xcite , a pop iii star finally gains @xmath170 with @xmath171 , @xmath1 with @xmath172 ( fiducial case ) , and @xmath173 with @xmath174 , for the fiducial magnitude of the initial angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the mass of a pop iii star depends on the initial angular momentum of the star - forming gas cloud and it gets @xmath175 when the initial angular momentum is reduced by 30 % of the fiducial one with @xmath172 ( fiducial case ) .",
    "accordingly , in this subsection , we investigate whether @xmath176 pop iii stars can be the progenitors of grbs .",

    "as shown in @xcite , the rsg branch in the higher mass stars appears due to the primary nitrogen production in the hydrogen burning shell .    for these stellar models , we investigate whether these stars can raise grbs by considering the jet propagation in the stellar envelope with the entirely similar manner as in  2 .",
    "note here that although for a pop iii star with @xmath184 the fall back effect should be taken into consideration in the formation of a black hole remnant ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , we neglect this effect in this section and discuss it in  4 . for bsgs ( @xmath185 and @xmath181 ) , the jet head propagates faster than the cocoon edge almost all the way through the stellar envelope like in fig .

    "we find that while it is difficult for pop iii grbs from 60 and 70 @xmath191 progenitors to trigger _ lobster _ , pop iii grbs from @xmath192 stars have the possibility to trigger _",
    "lobster_. second , we consider the case of the @xmath8 correlation and fig . [",
    "fig : existmass ] shows the results .",
    "the red dashed line represents the _ exist _ sensitivity . here also , the green , blue , sky - blue , grey and black solid lines correspond to the energy flux @xmath189 of pop iii grbs for @xmath190 and @xmath181 progenitors , respectively , but at @xmath193 .",
    "we find that only pop iii grbs from @xmath194 stars have the possibility to trigger _",
    "exist_. from fig .",
    "[ fig : lobmass ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : existmass ] , we can see that the energy fluxes of pop iii grbs from @xmath194 progenitors are larger by a factor of 3 to 4 than those from @xmath195 stars .",
    "this is because more massive progenitors exhibit larger radii ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] ) . the larger radius a progenitor has , the longer time it takes for the jet to reach the stellar surface and the more damped the jet luminosity after the breakout is .      in this subsection ,",
    "let us discuss the afterglow of a pop iii grb following @xcite . in the external shock model of an afterglow , we consider that a relativistic ejecta with isotropic equivalent kinetic energy @xmath196 and a half opening angle @xmath197 moves through the interstellar medium with density @xmath198 making a shocked region at the head of it . in the shocked region , some fractions , @xmath199 and @xmath200 , of the internal energy are provided to the magnetic field energy and the energy for the electron acceleration , respectively .",
    "the accelerated electrons are assumed to have a number distribution of the form @xmath201 and to raise afterglow emissions through the synchrotron radiation and the inverse compton emission . as fiducial parameter values of the external shock model",
    ", we adopt @xmath202 erg , @xmath203 @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 . in  3 , we assumed that 10 % of the jet energy was converted into the energy for the prompt photon emission .",
    "accordingly , we consider that the remaining 90 % of the jet energy is used for afterglow emissions .",
    "as we saw in  3 , @xmath207 erg , so here we adopt @xmath208 erg as a fiducial value .",
    "we refer to @xcite for other parameter values . under this model",
    ", we calculate the afterglow light - curves at 10 ghz , 1 ghz and 100 mhz .",
    "we show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : afg ] in the case of a pop iii grb at @xmath188 .",
    "the red , green and the blue solid lines refer to the light curves at 10 ghz , 1 ghz and 100 mhz , respectively .",
    "let us discuss the detectability of such pop iii grb radio afterglow emissions .",
    "the low frequency array ( lofar ) has frequency coverage from 10 to 250 mhz and the detection threshold of 0.2 mjy ( @xmath209 level ) at 100 mhz for 1 hr integration time . from fig .",
    "[ fig : afg ] , we find that the 100 mhz radio afterglow emission is not detectable by lofar . on the other hand , the expanded very large array ( evla )",
    "has frequency coverage from 1 to 50 ghz and the detection thresholds of 5.5 @xmath210jy and 1.8 @xmath210jy ( @xmath209 level ) at 1 ghz and 10 ghz , respectively for 1 hr integration time @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : afg ] , we can see that the energy fluxes at 1 ghz and 10 ghz are much larger than the detection thresholds of evla .",
    "once a pop iii afterglow emerges , we have the possibility to detect it at any time by evla , even if it occurs at such a high redshift universe ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "grbs are the brightest phenomena in the universe . their detections at high @xmath211 universe ( @xmath9 ) motivate us to expect grbs to be one of the powerful tools to probe the early universe .",
    "focusing on the high @xmath211 universe , we should consider the association of grbs with pop iii stars .",
    "recent numerical simulations @xcite suggest that pop iii stars obtain mass typically @xmath1 at their birth .",
    "zero metallicity stars are considered not to lose mass during entire life because of the low opacity envelopes @xcite .",
    "therefore , they enter into the pre - supernova stage keeping large hydrogen envelopes . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    ", pop iii stars end their lives as bsgs or rsgs depending on the amount of primary nitrogen produced in the shell burning .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether such low mass pop iii stars ranging from 30 to 90@xmath191 can be progenitors of grbs . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the jet propagation in the stellar envelope and analytically calculate the evolution of the jet - cocoon structure . in bsg envelopes ,",
    "the jet head velocity is larger than the cocoon velocity all the way except for the very early time and we can expect a successful jet breakout . on the other hand , in rsg envelopes ,",
    "the cocoon edge reaches the stellar surface as early as or even earlier than the jet head .",
    "we confirm that pop iii rsgs have enough largely extended envelopes for jets to be stalled on the way and can not raise grbs as shown in @xcite .",
    "we also confirm that pop iii bsgs are compact enough for the successful jet breakout and have the possibility to raise grbs as suggested in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the bsg models from woosley and heger used above ignored the effect of the rotation on the stellar evolution . found that when the rotation is included , pop iii stars within our noticed mass range end up as rsgs not bsgs . but considered the evolution of a star with an extremely high rotation velocity as one half the critical velocity .",
    "recent cosmological simulations ( @xcite and @xcite ) , however , suggested that pop iii stars are born in binary systems . in this case , the angular momentum which the star forming gas clump initially has is divided into the spin of each star and the orbital angular momentum so that these stars may rotate less rapidly .",
    "therefore , we think that such rapidly rotating stars they considered are rare and the calculations based on bsg models from woosley and heger make sense .    using our model , we evaluate observational characters of pop iii grbs .",
    "we predict that although pop iii grbs radiate as much energy as the most energetic local long grbs , pop iii grbs are slightly less luminous than local long grbs due to their much longer burst duration . assuming that the @xmath4 ( or @xmath97 ) correlation holds for pop iii grbs , we predict that pop iii grbs have the much softer ( or mildly softer ) spectra than local long grbs in the observer frame .",
    "@xcite predicted that the gamma - ray transients from low metallicity bsgs have duration of @xmath28 sec and the luminosity of @xmath29 erg @xmath212 , similar to pop iii grbs considered here .",
    "their transients are fed by the mass accretion of the outer most layers of stars and the accretion rate onto the bh ( @xmath213 ) is much smaller than that in the pop iii grb case , which imply typically from @xmath214 to @xmath215 .",
    "moreover , they simply assumed a central engine model with the roughly estimated conversion efficiency from the mass accretion to the jet energy as @xmath216 , while we consider a central engine which is driven by the magnetic process implicitly taking the disk accretion into account with the efficiency of @xmath217 .",
    "note that we choose this value so as for wolf - rayet stars to reproduce the energetics of local long grbs .",
    "therefore , although the characters are similar among them , we expect that gamma - ray transients considered in @xcite are different events from grbs considered in this paper .",
    "we also discuss the detectability of pop iii grbs by future satellite missions such as _ lobster _ and _ exist _ in detail .",
    "if the @xmath97 correlation holds , we have the possibility to detect pop iii grbs at redshifts @xmath9 as long duration x - ray rich grbs by _",
    "exist_. on the other hand , if the @xmath4 correlation holds , we have the possibility to detect pop iii grbs up to @xmath10 as long duration x - ray flashes by _",
    "we briefly comment the expected observable grb rate per year by _",
    "lobster _ using the results of @xcite .",
    "we calculate the observed grb rate per year @xmath218 as @xmath219 where @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 correspond to the intrinsic grb rate ( the number of on - axis and off - axis grbs ) per year , the detector field of view and the beaming factor of the burst . in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , they showed @xmath220 for an _",
    "optimistic _ case and we use their values . here , we also adopt the values of @xmath223 and @xmath224 sr for _ lobster _ @xcite . optimistically speaking , we predict that _ lobster _ detects about 40 , 4 and 0.4 pop iii grbs per year at @xmath225 and 19 , respectively .    at last ,",
    "we briefly discuss employed assumptions in this paper .",
    "firstly , we assume that all the stars considered in this paper ( @xmath226 pop iii stars ) form black holes directly after the stellar core collapse ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this is not always the case especially for less massive stars . shortly after the onset of the core collapse , a neutron star and a shock wave , which propagates outward or is stalled ,",
    "are considered to be formed at first . behind the shock wave ,",
    "a fall back accretion of the shocked envelope could be present and the continuous accretion onto the neutron star eventually leads to a black hole formation .",
    "although the early activity of the central engine could be affected by the accretion details , i.e. , the direct accretion or fall - back accretion , the conclusion of this paper is hardly changed .",
    "this is because the mass accretion at the interested time in this paper is coming from the massive envelope so that the central engine already collapsed to a black hole at the corresponding time .",
    "in addition , since the energy budget of the shock head is dominated by the envelope accretion , the details of the early phase does not affect the shock evolution in the late phase .",
    "for a more massive ( @xmath227 ) star , on the other hand , the energy of the shock wave is too low to explode even the portion of the envelope , so a black hole would be formed directly and our assumption is fully justified in this case .",
    "note that the mass threshold between the direct or fall - back induced black hole formation is still under the debate ( see e.g. @xcite ) and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "secondly , we assume that the whole stellar envelope accretes onto the bh ( see  3.1 ) . in order to confirm the validity of this assumption ,",
    "we evaluate the binding energy of each layer of the stellar envelope and compare it with the typical energy of a supernova outgoing shock @xmath228 erg , which is injected around @xmath102 km from the center .",
    "we find that the binding energy becomes larger than @xmath229 erg within @xmath230 cm .",
    "this means that the outgoing shock should stall on the way and we expect little mass ejection .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that in the late stage of the stellar evolution , the pre - supernova burning leads to a significant mass ejection from the outer envelope .",
    "but they considered only the case of a @xmath26 star with metallicity @xmath231 and commented that the amount of mass ejection depends on the metallicity and rotation etc .",
    "thus , the amount of the ejectable mass is uncertain for the progenitors employed here so that we do not consider this effect in this paper .",
    "we thank a. heger for kindly providing us his stellar model data .",
    "we thank d. yonetoku and r. yamazaki for fruitful discussion and suggestions about grb observations .",
    "we also thank k. omukai for fruitful discussions about population iii stars and the anonymous referee for fruitful comments .",
