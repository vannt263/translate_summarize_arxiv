    "in low - mass red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , matter must circulate in episodes of extended mixing from the convective zone to the radiative region where nuclear processing can occur ( the so - called cool bottom processing ; cbp ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the mechanism driving mixing remains under investigation , cbp predicts the chemical and isotopic evolution for a given bulk transport rate by utilizing the path integral of the nuclear reactions over the mass and independent of the mixing mechanism ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the necessary transport rates and processing temperatures are constrained by rgb / agb isotopic measurements and presolar meteoritic dust grain abundance ratios ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . weak circulation ( @xmath3 @xmath4/yr ) in which material is transported from the convective envelope to just above the h - burning shell , processed and then returned has had success in matching : ( i. ) @xmath5c/@xmath6c , c and n abundances in rgb stars , ( ii . ) @xmath5c/@xmath6c and n / o in agb stars and ( iii . ) @xmath7al/@xmath8al , @xmath9o/@xmath10o , @xmath11o/@xmath10o and @xmath5c/@xmath6c in circumstellar dust grains found in meteorites that must come from agb sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several physical origins have been proposed for the assumed mixing including : shear and thermohaline instabilities , meridional circulation and internal gravity waves ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "purely rotation - induced mixing appears insufficient as isotopic changes are minimal during the rgb and lead to a quenching of s - process nucleosynthesis during the agb ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it was proposed that buoyant magnetic flux tubes can induce the necessary transport rates required for cool bottom processing ( @xcite ) .",
    "constraints on the field strengths for the required mixing rates were calculated while the fields were assumed to originate from a dynamo operating in the rgb and agb interiors .",
    "in particular , the proposed mechanism would provide a means of rapid transport of material to the convective mantle and may provide a solution to the problem of li rich stars .",
    "magnetically mediated outflows resulting from dynamo amplification have been proposed as the origin of bipolarity in post - asympotitc giant branch stars ( post - agb ) and planetary nebula ( pn ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , dynamo - induced shaping requires differential rotation .",
    "this can be supplied by binary companions or sustained throughout the agb phase by convective redistribution of angular momentum ( @xcite ) .",
    "convection may resupply differential rotation ( analogous to the @xmath12-effect in the sun ) and sustain the magnetic fields throughout the rgb / agb stages ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it may be that a weaker dynamo ( supplying sufficient mixing ) is sustained throughout the rgb / agb phases , but that a binary companion is required to power bipolar jets in post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "we investigate the origin of large - scale magnetic fields via a dynamical , @xmath0 dynamo operating at the base of the convection zone in an initially 1.5 @xmath4 main sequence star during the rgb and agb phases .",
    "our stellar models are identical to those used in @xcite , and allow for direct comparison . in both phases , subadiabatic zones similar to the solar tachocline exist .",
    "we allow a fraction of the turbulent energy cascade to resupply shear , thus sustaining the dynamo .",
    "the field penetrates the shear zone and may transport material close to the h - burning shell .",
    "we compare our results to the field strengths and penetration depths needed for adequate magnetic mixing in low - mass rgb and agb stars .",
    "a 2-d schematic of our 1-d model is presented in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "the convection zone extends from the stellar surface to the interface between the convective and radiative zones .",
    "convective twisting motions convert buoyant toroidal fields into poloidal fields through the @xmath13-effect . below the convection layer , the differential rotation zone shears poloidal fields back into toroidal fields via the @xmath14-effect .",
    "we solve for the time evolution of dynamic quantities at the interface ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the rotation profile across the shear layer varies from @xmath14 at the interface to @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "thus , @xmath18 is a measure of shear in the differential rotation zone . if @xmath19 , the system exhibits solid body rotation .",
    "the average poloidal field @xmath20 , and average toroidal field @xmath21 , amplify from 1 g seed values until they are quenched through a drain of the available differential rotation energy .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a derivation of the precise mean - field equations solved .      to capture aspects of the 2-d , mean - field geometry within the framework of our 1-d time - dependent model , we employ two turbulent diffusion coefficients : @xmath22 , corresponding to diffusion of the poloidal field ( which grows primarily in the convective region ) and @xmath23 , corresponding to diffusion of the toroidal field ( which is amplified in the differential rotation zone ; see fig .",
    "1 ) . we also employ @xmath23 as the turbulent diffusion coefficient for the toroidal velocity .",
    "the convective region is highly turbulent and the differential rotation zone is weakly turbulent , therefore @xmath24 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 determines how far the toroidal component of the field can diffuse into the shear zone in a cycle period .",
    "the further into the shear zone the toroidal field can penetrate , the greater the shear energy that can be extracted and utilized by the dynamo .",
    "the depth to which the toroidal field can diffuse into the shear layer in a cycle period , @xmath25 , is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "the cycle period does increase in the dynamical regime , however , it does not change appreciably from its initial value .",
    "we set @xmath27 so that the field diffuses to the depth required by cool bottom processing ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this fixes @xmath29 @xmath30 s@xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath30 s@xmath31 as the required transport rates are @xmath33 flux tubes per year during the rgb and @xmath34 flux tubes per year during the agb @xcite .      as the magnetic field",
    "is amplified , differential rotation energy is drained to support its growth .",
    "the back - reaction of field amplification on the differential rotation results in rapid termination of the dynamo ( @xmath35 yrs ) from the initial available shear energy ; see @xcite for details . in order to sustain the dynamo through an rgb / agb lifetime",
    ", a constant differential rotation profile must be established .",
    "this occurs in the sun as convection re - seeds shear through the @xmath12-effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "although it remains to be established if a similar effect occurs in evolved stars , by analogy to the solar case , we allow a fraction of the turbulent energy cascade to resupply shear .",
    "additionally , we keep the rotation at the interface fixed .",
    "this is physically equivalent to storing the poynting flux in the interface region .",
    "if the field is trapped , the poynting flux does not emerge from the layer and thus , does not spin down the envelope .",
    "an rgb / agb dynamo will remain stable when the following two conditions are met : ( i. ) convection resupplies shear ( ii . ) the poynting flux is stored inside the envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the differential rotation profile in the interior is unknown .",
    "an estimate for the maximum sustainable shear that convection can resupply for a sufficiently rotating star is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of the convective layer , @xmath38 is the mass of the shear zone and @xmath39 is a typical convective velocity . for the rgb phase , @xmath40 s@xmath31 while @xmath41 s@xmath31 for the agb phase .",
    "if the initial differential rotation were greater than @xmath42 , the magnetic field would extract the excess shear before relaxing to sustainable values . in this case , an initial period of enhanced magnetic activity would be expected followed by steady dynamo action . in  3 , for suitable @xmath18 , we determine the fraction of turbulent cascade energy per unit time necessary to maintain a steady - state dynamo in our rgb / agb model stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our calculations are for mean - fields and correspond to volume averages . when the ratio of average thermal to magnetic pressure @xmath43 the magnetic field may be concentrated in flux tubes with an overall volume filling fraction @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "when the magnetic pressure in flux tubes are in pressure balance with their exterior , the mean - field strength is then related to a flux tube field , @xmath46 by @xmath47 .",
    "since the requirements from magnetic mixing @xcite constrain the magnitude of flux tube fields to have @xmath48 , the mean field can be lower than the flux tube field , relaxing the demands on the strength of the dynamo and the required shear .",

    ", we calculate the mean field at the base of the convection zone assuming that a fraction @xmath70 , of the turbulent energy cascade rate resupplies shear @xcite .",

    "for the rgb model , we find that @xmath87 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the convective resupply rate is the dominant quantity as it sets the differential rotation and hence the peak field strengths .",
