    "the description of the space of orbits of multidimensional toric action @xmath0 was a part of a hypergeometric project in [ gkz ] and led to a development of a notion of a * secondary polytope*. the space of orbits ( together with the limit degenerations ) is a toric variety which is dual to the * secondary polytope*. in [ gkz ] this space is called the * chow quotient*.    in [ a ] , this space was broadly generalised to the moduli space consisting of multiple irreducible components , called the * modular chow quotient*. virtual fundamental classes for this space are defined in the work [ m ] .    in our work",
    "we construct from the combinatorics of secondary polytope the * secondary operad * : cyclic operad with operations corresponding to the strata of the real version of modular chow quotient for @xmath1 .",
    "it corresponds to the morse theory in the @xmath2-dimensional setting , and the complex version ( which is still unclear ) would correspond to the losev - manin commutativity equations [ lm],[l ] .",
    "the relations between the various problems of enumerative geometry discussed in this paper are presented in the following tables :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     * - by @xmath3-morse we mean the description of integral leaves of the pair of commuting gradient - like vector fields .",
    "this theory seems to lack argument of general position ( which is present in @xmath2-morse ) , so it seems one should think only of the complexifiable actions .",
    "nevertheless , we can still develop the corresponding algebraic structures .",
    "'' signs in the table above correspond to the fact that we do nt really understand , what kind of enumerative problems should be considered : should we enumerate surfaces passing through the number of points , or the number of curves .",
    "the construction of alexeev suggests the latter , but precise problem is unclear .",
    "however , `` morse - like '' real version of the problem can be considered without any deformation , and this advantage allows us to describe the structure for the real case .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "@xmath3 we will construct the formula for the expected codimension of a toric degeneration , show that it sometimes gives non - positive result and suggest a program of getting rid of such `` bad '' degenerations . section @xmath4 is a brief exposition of the theory of secondary polytopes and alexeev s modular chow quotient . in the section",
    "@xmath5 we will define perturbed regularity condition and use it to fulfill our program and define the secondary operad . in the last section",
    "we will discuss questions our work opens .",
    "the algebro - geometric part of the paper is mostly sketchy , because we do nt prove anything new in the algebro - geometric realm .",
    "the reader interested in the rigorous constructions of the moduli spaces of surfaces should definitely take a look in the works [ a],[m ] .",
    "however , we hope that the algebraic structures from this enumerative geometry after development would incorporate these formalisms and show further directions for the appropriate generalisations",

    "the degeneration in the general position ( i.e. degenerations which occur in the codimension one ) are the degenerations with one intermediate critical point ( @xmath9 ) . taking @xmath17",
    "we can conclude that the space of curves between @xmath8 and @xmath14 consists of the union of circles and line segments , and boundary components of the line segments are precisely the elements of the sum @xmath18 .",
    "for each line segment , the contributions of its ends have an opposite signs , hence the sum vanishes .    if we consider the fundamental cycle of the space of integral curves @xmath19 , then by the same argument , the following maurer - cartan relation holds : @xmath20 for any @xmath8 , @xmath14 .        _ degeneration of an integral curve in a morse theory .",

    "concavity of the constructed piecewise - linear function follows ( by the local checks on a boundaries between @xmath72 and @xmath74 s ) from the fact that @xmath75 s are the vertices of an affine fan .",
    "so , we are in a need for the new object , which would be dual to the non - regular decompositions . from the fact that two affine fans which are combinatorially equivalent and have parallel edges correspond to the same degenerated toric variety we come to the following    * graph with directions ( gwd ) * is an oriented graph with outgoing edges ( one can think that they go to the vertex `` infinity '' ) .",
    "each edge is endowed with an additional data : the direction , i.e. unit vector in @xmath35 .",
    "it is allowed to change orientation of an edge together with changing the direction of an edge to the opposite .",

    "representations of @xmath88 obviously form a vector space @xmath93 , and set of positive representations @xmath94 is a convex polyhedral cone .    the reader could notice that we actually defined some invariant of the gwd - the dimension of its space of representations .",
    "the calculation of dimensions shows that it is expected to be @xmath95 , where @xmath7 denotes the number of vertices and @xmath86 denotes the number of internal edges - it coincides with the formula of the expected codimension .",

    "the composition is the gluing of two polygons by a set of edges .",
    "* sign convention : * the set of internal edges of the polygonal decompositions is ordered . changing an order shifts the sign by the sign of the permutation .",

    ". there might be different conventions about @xmath97-grading .    for a regular decomposition @xmath70 the sign data",
    "is equivalent to the orientation on the polyhedral cone @xmath98 , where @xmath23 is a normal fan to @xmath70 ( coming from the exact sequence @xmath99 ) .",

    "@xmath8 _ are not too rigid ( i.e. , all decompositions are regular ) . _",
    "it is rare situation and it does nt follow from the conditions we imposed on @xmath8 .    then , the following works :    the differential @xmath101 is defined as follows : for any convex polytope @xmath102 it returns @xmath103 the sum over decompositions of @xmath102 ( with the canonical sign data ) . for a decomposition @xmath104 is defined by leibniz rule .",
    "@xmath105    the sign data from the leibniz rule is equivalent to the orientation by outward normal vector : for any decomposition @xmath70 of codimension 2 there is @xmath3-dimensional cone of representations , which has boundary , consisting of two edges - corresponding to the two summands of type @xmath70 in @xmath106 with the opposite signs .",
    "reformulating geometrically : consider the space of representations of gwd s dual to the decompositions of @xmath102 , and glue them along the boundary components - when a part of the representation of a gwd shrink into a point , glue this boundary component to another space of representations with gwd with this part shrinked .",
    "then the operations of secondary operad will correspond to the ( oriented ) facets of this space , @xmath101 is just the dual cellular differential and @xmath105 is obvious .",

    "let us consider the ( germ of ) deformation @xmath108 general enough ( each direction is being deformed smoothly ) .",
    "then , no too rigid graphs can be constructed using this set of directions for @xmath109 .",
    "this is the main reason why we ask @xmath8 to have no triples of points on a same line - we do nt want the same directions to occur in a different parts of gwd .    the decomposition @xmath70 is called * perturbedly regular * if the dual gwd with deformed directions admits a positive realisation for @xmath110 .",
    "no too rigid graphs are dual to the perturbedly regular decompositions , but some irregular decompositions will become perturbedly regular .        _ some irregular decompositions will become perturbedly regular . _",

    "@xmath105    the same argument as in the previous theorem should be applied to the same space with @xmath111 .",
    "now , as we defined an operad , we will discuss why do we think that this definition is right .",

    "perturbation * of a too rigid graph is a set of all perturbed graphs who s realisations tend to this too rigid graph as @xmath113 .",
    "so , the definition of @xmath101 can be reformulated as follows : we take the sum over all @xmath23 s with @xmath114 , but then perturb too rigid summands .",
    "_ sketch of the proof _",

    "it can be easily seen ( and contained in [ a ] ) that the quotient torus ( which controls the deformations ) is the cokernel of the map @xmath118 .",
    "it agrees with the fact that the space of first - order deformations of the directions modulo the subspace of deformations not destroying too rigid graph is the cokernel of the complex @xmath119 ( and these too complexes can be organised into a commutative diagram via exponentiation ) .",

    "the boundary component is being tended to by this @xmath2-parametric subgroup if and only if it is contained in the perturbation .",

    "how to do it ?    what should one do if the set @xmath8 has triples of points on a same line ? even if the perturbation can be done in such a way that avoids too rigid graphs ( and it seems it can ) , it is still unclear what should be used instead of leibniz rule .",
