    "complexity theory concerns the classification of combinatorial optimization problems , according to the computational cost required for their solution  @xcite .",
    "a central role is occupied by the class of hard problems named np ( non - deterministic polynomial time ) . for problems in this class",
    ", a potential solution can be checked in polynomial time , whereas finding one solution may require , in the worst case , a time growing exponentially with system size .",
    "often , the crude worst - case analysis of ordinary complexity theory hides the mechanism which leads to np complexity .",
    "a statistical mechanical analysis of the ensemble of possible instances of the problem ( we could say a `` typical case '' analysis , eventually dependent on some macroscopic parameter of the theory ) would have the ambitious challenge of deepening the understanding of computational complexity , and improving the algorithm design for real world applications .",
    "for example , in a variety of cases , the problem admits a space of parameters , and a certain order parameter exists , showing a critical behaviour . in some of these cases ,",
    "a widespread conjecture is that the computationally hard instances appear with a significant probability only when generated near `` phase boundaries '' of the ensemble , with respect to this phase transition .",
    "an exemplar case of this phenomenon is the random boolean satisfiability problem ( @xmath0-sat  @xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "a pecular transition , called _ sat / unsat transition _ , occurs : when the density of clauses is higher than a certain critical value , the system is highly constrained , and the average probability of having a solution goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "otherwise , the system is slightly constrained , and the average probability of having a solution goes to one in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hard - to - solve instances can be found only in a narrow region on the density axes , in correspondence of the critical density .",
    "this fact has a clear interpretation : heuristic algorithms for randomly searching a solution are efficient when the density is low enough , while algorithms for randomly searching a contradiction are efficient when the density is high enough . at the phase boundary , however , both the average probability of being satisfable or unsatisfiable",
    "are order 1 , then heuristic ( incomplete ) search algorithms have no way to disentangle , in a given finite time , the unsatisfiable instances , from those which are simply very hard to solve .",
    "so , in this region there appears an exponential critical slowing down which makes the search inefficient for any practical purpose .    a sub - class of the np class exists , called np - complete , such that , for each problem in this sub - class , no other np problem is more than a polynomial factor harder .",
    "informally , a problem is np - complete if answers can be verified quickly ( np requirement ) , and a quick algorithm to solve this problem can be used to solve all other np problems quickly ( completeness requirement ) .",
    "np - complete problems are particularly important , as , in some sense , they manifest all the potential difficulties of any np problem , and are a sort of `` language '' for properly describing every possible problem in np class . the @xmath0-sat problem is a np - complete problem for @xmath2 . for its simplicity in formulation , and versatily in encoding other np problems , it has acquired a paradigmatic role for the study of np complexity .",
    "it has been studied both directly ( see e.g.  @xcite , or , for a review , @xcite and references therein ) , or by the introduction of more `` handable '' variants which reproduces some of the peculiarity of @xmath0-sat problems . one step in this direction is the introduction of the _ hyper - sat _",
    "model by f.  ricci - tersenghi , m.  weight and r.  zecchina ( see @xcite ) .      in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss a very simple and exactly solvable model for the generation of random combinatorial problems .",
    "the model has deep analogies with the hyper - sat model , and inherits from it some important characteristics :    * it is hard to handle by local search methods in the whole region of the parameter space ; * the problem may be solved in polynomial time by a simple global method ( gauss reduction ) and therefore belongs to the class p ; * in a variant ( unfrustrated model ) one solution may be superimposed by construction .",
    "the most important feature of our model is the fact that also the statistical properties of the model are exactly known , at finite and infinite size , thus yielding to a wide amount of analytical results .",
    "for example , we obtain the exact expression for the probability distribution of the rank of a @xmath3 random matrix in @xmath4 , result which was previously known only in the limit @xmath5 at constant @xmath6 .",
    "this result contains all the information about the average `` satisfiability '' probability , and much more .",
    "the methods used in the paper can be extended in order to calculate other interesting quantities .",
    "furthermore , the simple underlying geometry of the model allow for a clarifying graph - theoretical interpretation of the problem , which leads to the formulation of an exact duality of the system",
    ".      we will start with a small prolog of elementary linear algebra , as it will provide a nice setting for our model .",
    "systems of linear equations , beyond the ordinary theory on @xmath7 or @xmath8 , can be studied on more generic structures .",
    "for example , in the textbook @xcite , following the original work of kovalenko and collaborators @xcite , a certain number of questions about systems of linear equations on the galois field @xmath4 is answered .",
    "the galois field @xmath4 , with @xmath1 a prime number , is a finite field whose elements are the integers in @xmath9 ( i.e.  the integers from 0 to @xmath10 ) , and sum and product are defined modulo @xmath1 :    @xmath11    the prototype of a linear system @xmath12 , or of a homogeneous linear system @xmath13 , in @xmath4 , when the above definitions are assumed , maintains the same formal structure .",
    "it also preserves most of the fundamental results of linear algebra , like the existence of a gauss algorithm for triangulating a matrix , or the fact that the rank plus the dimension of the kernel is equal to the number of rows of the matrix .",
    "statistical mechanics plays a role when we consider averages over a certain ensemble of matrices and vectors , in a sort of `` thermodynamic limit '' on their dimension .",
    "for example , given two integers @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and a prime number @xmath1 , a good statistical ensemble is the set of the couples @xmath16 , with @xmath17 an @xmath3 matrix , and @xmath18 an @xmath15-dimensional vector , with elements randomly chosen in @xmath9 .",
    "a statistical mechanic would calculate , for a certain fixed value of @xmath19 , in the limit @xmath5 , the average satisfiability of this problem , i.e. , for a random `` extraction '' of an instance @xmath16 from the ensemble , which is the probability that the linear system in @xmath4 , @xmath12 , has at least one solution . in more detail",
    ", we could calculate which is the probability distribution for the dimension of the kernel of the linear application @xmath17 , in the limit of infinite @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath20 fixed .",
    "this last point is exactly the main question answered by the russian school in @xcite , which will be rede rived as a preliminary result in this paper .      in the framework of statistical mechanics ,",
    "it is frequent to work with spin variables @xmath21 , while in the framework of random satisfiability , it is customary to work with boolean variables @xmath22 .",
    "we will often switch between the two formulations , with the table of correspondences @xmath23 so , we will consider a set of @xmath14 spin variables @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , or , alternatively , a set of @xmath14 boolean variables @xmath26 .",
    "each of the @xmath27 choices of the variables , denoted by @xmath28 , or by @xmath29 , will be called a _",
    "configuration_.    a random satisfiability model is defined in terms of an ensemble of random _ instances _ , that is a collection of @xmath30 boolean conditions on the variables ( called _ clauses _ ) , randomly chosen from a certain set .",
    "this set of the possible clauses will primarily distinguish the different models , so it will be discussed further , case by case .",
    "given a certain instance , if we have at least one configuration which simultaneously satisfies all the clauses , the instance is a _ satisfiable _ ( sat ) one , else it is an _ unsatisfiable _ ( unsat ) one",
    ".    we will introduce a fictitious hamiltonian for each instance .",
    "our choice is to assign to a configuration an energy equal to the number of unsatisfied clauses .",
    "the low temperature limit of the partition function calculated with this hamiltonian is the number of solutions for a certain instance .",
    "we will adopt the graphical convention for the logical operators @xmath31 ( and ) , @xmath32 ( or ) and @xmath33 ( xor ) .      in this model , given an integer @xmath0 ,",
    "the set of clauses @xmath34 is the set of all the @xmath0-uples of variable indices @xmath35 , with a boolean assignment @xmath36 attached to each index .",
    "an instance in the ensemble is a subset @xmath37 of this set of clauses , with cardinality @xmath15 , and with no repetitions admitted .",
    "a certain configuration will be a solution if @xmath38 if we call @xmath24 the spin variables associated to the boolean variables @xmath26 , and @xmath39 the spin value associated to the boolean assignments @xmath40 , both following the table ( [ tavcorr ] ) , a possible spin hamiltonian which counts the unsatisfied clauses is @xmath41    interpreted as a spin model hamiltonian , the system has random diluted quenched couplings , with a complicated pattern of interactions : for each @xmath0-uple of variables , if we have a @xmath0-spin coupling between them , then we have also couplings between all the subsets of the @xmath0 variables , with a choice of signs causing the @xmath42 levels of the @xmath0-variables @xmath43-clause subsystem to split in a @xmath44 multiplet of energy @xmath45 , and one level of energy @xmath44 .      this model , introduced by ricci - tersenghi , weigt and zecchina in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as a variant of the @xmath0-sat with a more clear spin structure , is defined as follows .",
    "given an integer @xmath0 , the set of clauses @xmath34 is the set of all the @xmath0-uples of variable indices @xmath35 , with a single boolean assignment @xmath46 attached .",
    "an instance in the ensemble is a subset @xmath37 of this new set of clauses , with cardinality @xmath15 , and no repetitions admitted .",
    "a certain configuration will be a solution if @xmath47 if we call @xmath48 the spin value associated to the boolean assignments @xmath49 , again following the table ( [ tavcorr ] ) , a possible spin hamiltonian which counts the unsatisfied clauses is @xmath50 this ensemble of hamiltonians has the form of a diluted mean field @xmath0-spin disordered system , that is a spin model with @xmath14 variables and @xmath15 quenched @xmath0-spin couplings , randomly chosen between all the @xmath0-uples of variables , and with values randomly chosen in @xmath51 .",
    "a variant of the problem , named `` unfrustrated '' model , is the restriction of the clauses set only to the clauses with @xmath52 ( that is , a ferromagnetic diluted @xmath0-spin system ) . in this case",
    "we will have the obvious `` ferromagnetic '' solution @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) for each instance .",
    "the hyper - sat model can be reinterpreted in the framework of random linear systems we introduced in the prolog . given a hyper - sat instance with @xmath14 variables and @xmath15 clauses",
    ", we can introduce an @xmath3 matrix @xmath55 in the field @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 if the variable @xmath26 appears in the @xmath58-th clause , and @xmath59 elsewhere . with the expanded table of correspondences",
    "@xmath60 we have the composition correspondences @xmath61",
    "so , for each clause @xmath62 , @xmath63 so , at the end , we can analyze the problem in the more handable form @xmath64 ( frustrated model ) , or @xmath65 ( unfrustrated model ) .",
    "the shift to @xmath0-spin models will be given by the correspondence ( [ tavcorr2 ] ) , so the hamiltonian in the spin formulation will be @xmath66 while in the linear system formulation will be @xmath67 with @xmath68 if @xmath69 is even , and @xmath70 if @xmath69 is odd .",

    "{ \\ , .}\\ ] ] beyond the correspondence between a specific hyper - sat instance and a specific random linear system , we remark that the choice of the ensemble is crucial for the statistical properties of the system .",
    "the statistical ensemble of the hyper - sat is very different to the random ensemble we suggested as an example in the prolog , as in the hyper - sat we have exactly @xmath0 non zero terms in each row of @xmath73 .",
    "a main problem in information theory consists in signal reconstruction when a sequence of bits is transmitted through a `` noisy '' channel , that is a channel where transmission errors can occur with a certain probability .",
    "just to fix the ideas , we will concentrate on the so called _ symmetric noise channel _ , in which each bit has a probability @xmath74 to be transmitted unaltered , and a probability @xmath75 to be transmitted as its negate : @xmath76 when @xmath77 no error can occur , and transmission is for granted . when @xmath78 the output signal is totally decorrelated from the input signal , and no inference is possible even in principle . in the intermediate cases ,",
    "the task is to use the information transmitted through the channel , in the form of the partial correlation between input and output signals , to obtain the safe transmission of a shorter signal .",
    "this problem can be easily generalized to a generic `` alphabet '' , with characters in @xmath9 ( i.e. , instead of having bits in @xmath79 , we have variables in @xmath80 ) .",
    "a generalization of the symmetric noise channel defined above could be as follows : each character has a probability @xmath74 to be transmitted unaltered , and a probability @xmath81 to be converted in each of the other characters .",
    "for example , when @xmath82 we would have @xmath83 in this case , the totally decorrelated case occurs for @xmath84 .    a _",
    "code _ is an algorithm which fulfills the task above , replacing the interesting signal with a redundant but error - robust encoding of it .",
    "the ratio between the length of the original and of the encoded signals is called the _ rate _ of the code . a critical rate exists such that , in the limit of infinite length of the message , the decoding procedure almost always succeeds in reconstructing the original signal from the noise - distorted transmitted stream . in most cases , the probability of success as a function of the rate jumps to one in an abrupt way , typical of critical phenomena ( reconstructable - unreconstructable transition ) .",
    "the quality of a code is mainly given by two parameters : the critical _ rate _ at given error probability and the computational complexity class of the encoding and decoding algorithms .",
    "a family of codes , called _ linear codes _",
    "@xcite , is closely related to random satisfiability problems and certain spin glass models in statistical mechanics @xcite , and a deep insight into the reconstructable - unreconstructable transition can be derived from the study of the phase diagrams of the related spin glass models @xcite .",
    "a well - known example of linear code , called _ varshamov s linear code _ , or _ rlc _ ( _ random linear code _ ) @xcite has been the first discovered code to reach the _ gilbert - varshamov bound _ on the rate of the code .",
    "the varshamov s code is closely related to our model .",
    "suppose we have a random linear system @xmath64 in @xmath4 , with @xmath15 equations , in @xmath85 variables , and suppose the kernel of the linear application @xmath73 has the minimum possible dimension @xmath86 .",
    "this linear system can be used for the error correcting transmission of a message of length @xmath87 , on an alphabet of @xmath1 characters .",
    "first we introduce some definitions :    1 .",
    "the possible original messages are the vectors @xmath88 of the linear space @xmath89 .",
    "the encoding map @xmath90 , which encodes the original @xmath87-bits message in the redundant @xmath14-bits codeword , is defined with the aid of the linear application @xmath73 .",
    "if we choose a basis for the kernel @xmath91 the map will be defined by @xmath92 3 .",
    "a distance on the codewords space @xmath93 will be introduced : @xmath94 { \\ , .}\\ ] ]    then , for the transmission of a certain message , we follow the procedure :    1 .",
    "the original message is a vector @xmath95 .",
    "we use the map @xmath96 for the encoding .",
    "the original codeword is @xmath97 .",
    "the codeword is transmitted through the noisy channel .",
    "the transmitted codeword will be a vector @xmath98 .",
    "the probability distribution for the transmitted codeword depends on the kind of noise we consider . in the case of symmetric noise",
    "we have @xmath99 4 .   for the reconstruction of the signal",
    "could be used , for example , the minimum distance decoding criterium , that is , if we call @xmath100 the minimum of the function @xmath101 in the image of the encoding map @xmath102 , we choose as the reconstructed message @xmath103 the vector @xmath104 .",
    "the interesting question is , in the `` thermodynamic '' limit of long signals @xmath5 , with the _ rate _",
    "@xmath105 fixed , which is the probability that the reconstructed message @xmath103 is identical to the original message @xmath106 , as a function of the noise parameter @xmath75 and of the rate @xmath107 .",
    "a statistical study @xcite shows the tricky fact that this probability tends to one if @xmath108 , and it tends to zero if @xmath109 , and that the critical line @xmath110 is exactly the shannon bound for the capacity of a symmetric noise channel @xcite .",
    "another mathematical framework in which this kind of satisfiability problems is well depicted is hypergraph theory . in these sections",
    "we will shortly introduce some notation which will be useful in the following , first starting with ordinary graph theory , then jumping to hypergraphs ( for an introductory bibliography , see @xcite ) .    given @xmath111 a finite set of cardinality @xmath14 , called the set of `` vertices '' , we define the set of all the non - ordered couples of vertices in @xmath112 @xmath113 as the set of `` edges '' .",
    "for each subset @xmath114 of cardinality @xmath15 , the datum of the set of vertices and of this set is called the _ graph _",
    "@xmath115 , with @xmath14 vertices and @xmath15 edges .    given a vertex @xmath116 , its _ coordination _ ( or _ degree _ )",
    "is defined as the number of edges @xmath117 such that @xmath118 .",
    "path _ between the vertices @xmath119 and @xmath120 is a sequence of vertices and edges in @xmath121 @xmath122 such that @xmath123 ; the number of edges @xmath87 is called its _",
    "length_. a graph is said _ connected _ if , for each couple of vertices , exists a path which joins them .",
    "a non - trivial closed path is usually called a _",
    "loop_. more generically , we will adopt the `` physical '' convention of using the term loop for any subset of the set of edges @xmath124 such that the graph , restricted to this set @xmath125 , has only vertices of even ( eventually zero ) coordination .    in the limit of large @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    ", we can introduce an ensemble of graphs , giving a probability measure over the possible sets of edges , and we can calculate statistical averages of interesting quantities .",
    "for example , an ensemble could be the one in which only connected graphs with @xmath15 edges are admitted , and no repetitions of edges are allowed .      a generalization of graph theory concerns objects in which the set of possible edges @xmath96 is replaced by the set of all non - ordered @xmath0-uples of vertices ( typically @xmath126 ) , called _ hyper - edges _ : @xmath127 the datum of the set of vertices and of a subset of admitted hyper - edges will be called a _",
    "the notions of coordination , path , connectivity , and loop , as we defined them in the previous section , immediately generalize to this case .",
    "in particular , the notion of _ hyper - loop _ , as a subset @xmath124 such that the relative hypergraph @xmath125 has only vertices of even coordination , will be crucial in the following .    the ensemble of connected hypergraphs with @xmath15 hyper - edges , with repetitions allowed , is the proper graphical scheme for describing the topological features of ordinary @xmath0-sat problems , and also of the hyper - sat , although , as we already mentioned in the previous section , we should also imagine some boolean assignments attached to the hyper - edges ( one for each vertex of each hyper - edge in the case of @xmath0-sat , just one per hyper - edge in the case of hyper - sat , and no assignments at all in the case of unfrustrated hyper - sat )",
    ".    another possible variant could be the one in which hyper - edges with any number of vertices are admitted @xmath128 the ensemble of all possible hypergraphs of @xmath15 hyper - edges in @xmath129 , with homogeneous measure , and no repetitions allowed , is the one which describes the model we will define in the next chapter .      in the hyper - sat model the configurations",
    "shows a @xmath130 group structure .",
    "the group operation is the sum term - by - term in the linear system formulation , or the product term - by - term in the spin formulation , that is @xmath131 in the unfrustrated model , the set of solutions is a subgroup @xmath132 , with @xmath133 generators , of the configuration group .",
    "the fact that in the unfrustrated hyper - sat the set of solutions is a subgroup is an immediate consequence of the fact that the kernel of a linear application in @xmath56 is a subspace @xmath132 of the vector space @xmath134 .",
    "let s go back to the formulation of a hyper - sat instance in terms of a system of linear equations in @xmath56 : @xmath135 we can graphically identify each variable with a vertex , and each clause with a hyper - edge joining the vertices which appears in it .",
    "each subset of equations in the system can be identified with the sub - hypergraph ( in the following just hypergraph ) of the original one , obtained by restriction to the correspondent hyper - edges .",
    "the sum of the equations in the subset will be called the _ equation associated to the hypergraph_.    note that also hypergraphs have a group structure @xmath136 : given two hypergraphs , the group operation is the disjoint union of the two hypergraphs , from the graphical point of view , and the sum of the two corresponding equations , from the algebraic point of view .",
    "the identity is the empty set .",
    "the set of hyperloops is a subgroup @xmath137 of the hypergraph group .",
    "when the subgraph is a hyperloop , the associated equation is a relation involving no variables : in the unfrustrated case , it is just a trivial identity ; in the frustrated case , it is a configuration - independent characteristic of the instance which could eventually determine an _ a priori _ unsatisfiability . because of randomness in the choice of the @xmath138 for the instance",
    ", this will happen with @xmath139 probability for each linearly independent hyperloop .",
    "the number of linearly independent elements in a group @xmath137 is just @xmath140 .",
    "so the sentence in @xcite which explains the role of hyperloops in the frustrated model :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` as soon as one hyperloop arises in the hypergraph , half the formulas become unsatisfiable ...

    "we can see that an intriguing symmetry of roles between solutions and hyperloops seems to arise .",
    "this symmetry of roles is more clear in the linear system formulation , as we have that a homogeneous solution is a solution of @xmath141 , while a hyperloop is a solution of @xmath142 . in our model , the analytical solvability will provide a clarifying reinterpretation of these heuristic arguments .",
    "one difficulty on an exact analytic approach to the hyper - sat is that the ensemble of formulas is _ not _ symmetric : for an admitted clause , the number of 1 in each row must be exactly @xmath0 , while there is not any similar constraint on the columns .",
    "this fact introduces difficult - to - handle correlations on the values of the entries in the grid formulation .    in this section",
    "we introduce a model defined on a larger ensemble , which cancels correlations between the entry of the matrix , and fully exploits the symmetry of roles between solutions and hyperloops we suggested in section [ subsec7452 ] .",
    "the model we are going to define is a random satisfiability problem .",
    "so it will be defined by an ensemble of _ instances _ , with a probability measure on it ( the possible realizations of the problem , with associated the probability that such a realization occurs ) , an ensemble of _ configurations _ ( the potential solutions ) , and a notion of _",
    "satisfiability_.    given the integer parameter @xmath1 , which must be a prime number , and the `` noise '' parameter @xmath143 $ ] ( as it will have a role similar to the one of the noise parameter of error correcting codes , see section [ subsec538 ] ) , the ensemble of the instances is the product set of the set of all the @xmath3 matrices @xmath55 , filled with integers in @xmath9 , each matrix being equiprobable , and the @xmath15-dimensional vector space @xmath144 , where the probability for a vector @xmath18 to be extracted is dumped accordingly to the number of its non - zero entries .",
    "more precisely @xmath145 where we used the short notation of equation ( [ deltaq ] ) ; the parameter @xmath75 has been chosen to reproduce the average fraction of non - zero elements in @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 will determine the average solvability of the problem : large values of @xmath146 corresponds to weakly constrained systems , and a typical instance will be solvable , while , on the contrary , small values of @xmath146 correspond to highly constrained systems , and a typical instance will be unsolvable ( or will have only the superimposed solution in the unfrustrated case , see below ) .    the ensemble of the configurations is the @xmath14-dimensional vector space @xmath93 . a certain configuration @xmath147 is said to be a solution if it solves the linear system @xmath148 the particular case of @xmath77 is called _ unfrustrated _ , as we have a superimposed `` ferromagnetic '' solution @xmath147 for each instance @xmath73 .",
    "when @xmath149 we will deal with the _ frustrated _ version .",
    "when @xmath75 reaches the value @xmath150 , the model will be called _ totally frustrated _",
    ", as the probability measure is flat also for the inhomogeneous terms @xmath18 .    a particular realization of the problem ( _ instance _ ) will be said _",
    "satisfiable _ ( sat ) if we have at least one solution , in the frustrated model , and at least one more solution , after the superimposed one , in the unfrustrated model .",
    "elsewhere , the instance will be said to be _",
    "unsatisfiable _ ( unsat ) .",
    "although in this part we only study the average solvability of the problem , it is customary of a statistical mechanical approach to introduce a fictitious hamiltonian , such that the solutions correspond to the states with zero energy , and all the other configurations have a rigorously positive energy , study the thermodynamic of this new system , and recover the original model in the zero temperature limit .    obviously , there is a large arbitrarity in the choice of the hamiltonian , and we will analyze various possibilities in the third part of the paper .",
    "anyway , just to fix the ideas , we will concentrate on the most simple choice , the one in which the hamiltonian just `` counts '' the number of violated clauses : @xmath151 a more familiar spin reformulation is @xmath152 where the correspondence is @xmath153 in the homogeneous case every @xmath154 .",
    "this model shares with the random energy model @xcite , the property that the energy of different states are ( almost always ) uncorrelated .",
    "more precisely , it is true that , if @xmath155 are the energy respectively of the states @xmath156 , calculated with a certain instance , for each couple of functions @xmath157 , @xmath158 we have @xmath159 if @xmath160 , and the fraction of states for which this last condition is verified is about @xmath161 .      as we anticipated in section [ subsec7452 ] , a nice feature of our model , which is common also to the hyper - sat model and to the random linear system problem ,",
