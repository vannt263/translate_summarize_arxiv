    "electromagnetic relativistic solitary waves , commonly named relativistic solitons , are self - trapped localized structures that are excited during the interaction of a high - intensity laser with a plasma .",
    "they typically consist on a region of rarified plasma where a high amplitude electromagnetic wave , with frequency below the laser frequency , is trapped .",
    "a solitary wave can be classified according to its polarization ( linear or circular ) , its group velocity ( standing or moving waves ) and also its state ( isolated structure or embedded in long laser pulses ) . since part of the laser energy is dedicated to excite them , they may affect to certain laser applications like inertial confinement fusion , particle acceleration , plasma lens for ultra - intense laser focusing and high - brightness x- and gamma rays generation @xcite .",
    "they also offer an excellent opportunity to confront theoretical and experimental works and enhance our knowledge on non - linear waves in plasmas .",
    "this great variety of solitary waves has been the subject of an important research activity on plasma physics , including analytical work , numerical simulations and laboratory experiments .",
    "pioneer works @xcite were followed by an intense activity mainly in the framework of the relativistic fluid model .",
    "exact 1-dimensional circularly polarized solitary waves solutions , including isolated @xcite and embedded in long laser pulses @xcite waves , were found .",
    "single - hump and multi - hump solitons are possible .",
    "all these solutions , except the one presented in ref that admits an analytical form , were found numerically .",
    "the analysis of linearly polarized waves , however , is more difficult mainly due to the high harmonic generation .",
    "some approximate one - dimensional solutions have been presented in the weak amplitude limit @xcite and in the framework of the akhiezer - polovin system @xcite .",
    "exact 2-dimensional linearly polarized solitary wave solutions of the fluid model were also found @xcite .",
    "solitary waves were observed in particle - in - cell ( pic ) codes @xcite and their footprints were detected in laboratory experiments @xcite .    in the theoretical works ,",
    "the analysis was mostly focused on the spatio - temporal structures of the plasma and electromagnetic fields and the relationship between the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave and its frequency . a central role in the analysis",
    "was also played by the organization of the solitons in parameter space , i.e. , in the velocity and frequency plane .",
    "some solitary waves are organized in branches : given a value of the group velocity , the soliton exists for a single frequency value .",
    "examples of this type are the circularly polarized moving solitons discovered in ref . .",
    "on the other hand , other types of solitons , like the circularly polarized standing soliton found in ref . or the embedded solitons of ref . and , have a _ continuous spectrum_. in this case , for a given velocity , solitons exist for any frequency within a certain range . the discrete or continuous character of the spectrum can be anticipated by using arguments from the dynamical system theory , including the dimension of the system , the characteristics of the stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed point where the orbit connects , and the hamiltonian and/or reversible character of the system  @xcite .    a common feature to all the previously cited 1-dimensional solitons is the stationary character of the soliton profile in a frame moving with its group velocity . under the traveling wave ansatz ,",
    "the amplitude of the solutions just depends on the coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "however , in recent fluid simulations aimed at the interaction of an ultrashort laser pulse with an overdense plasma in the relativistic transparency regime , solitonic structures with a breather - like behavior were observed @xcite .",
    "energy exchange between the soliton and the plasma occurred at twice the laser frequency .",
    "these periodic oscillations in time of the soliton amplitude is a novel aspect in one - dimensional fluid theory but a well - known feature for linearly s - polarized 2-dimensional solitons , as shown by past particle - in - cell simulation @xcite and more recent solutions found in the fluid model @xcite .",
    "an oscillatory behavior of 1-dimensional linearly polarized solitary waves was also observed in pic simulations of laser - plasma interactions @xcite .    these observations in both fluid @xcite and pic simulations",
    "@xcite motivate us to determine numerically exact linearly polarized solitary wave solutions of the relativistic fluid model . following the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , we did not restrict the analysis to stationary solutions , but let them oscillate periodically in time . from a numerical point of view",
    ", this a challenging problem because one needs to work with a system of partial differential equations ( instead of ordinary differential equations ) .",

    "the structures remain unchanged for several plasma periods and they do not seem to be prone to any instability . the amplitude and the oscillation frequency of the waves during the simulations coincide with the values expected from the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : soliton : standing ] .",
    "the same is true for the frequency and wavenumber of the small oscillations in the tail .",
    "this confirms the integrity of the methodology and correctness of the solutions presented in this work .",
    "as the solitary waves appear stable they are ideal candidates for further research , for example , for the investigation of the mutual collisions among two or more standing structures as has been studied for the circular polarization case in ref .",
    "we have presented novel exact numerical solutions of the relativistic maxwell - fluid model in a cold plasma with fixed ions .",
    "one - dimensional solitary waves with linear polarization and a breather - like behavior were computed by using a numerical method based on a finite - difference scheme .",
    "the spatio - temporal structure of the electromagnetic and plasma fields was presented as well as the main properties of the waves as a function of their frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the solitary waves exist in the frequency range @xmath170 , with @xmath2 the frequency value where the minimum of the plasma density vanishes .",
    "an analysis based on the different energy contributions showed that these localized structures consist of a plasma cavity where a periodic exchange of energy at frequency @xmath171 occurs between an electromagnetic wave and the plasma electrons .    unlike circularly polarized waves , which are stationary , linearly polarized waves exhibit a breather like behavior .",
    "longitudinal variables , like the electron momentum , oscillate with the frequency @xmath171 ; electrons are moved inward and outward from the plasma cavity twice per period .",
    "besides this fundamental difference , other features of the solitary waves are shared by both types of polarization .",
    "for instance , the amplitude vanishes ( is enhanced ) and the width increases ( decreases ) as the frequency approaches to @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . for a given frequency ,",
    "the amplitude of linearly polarized waves is greater than for circular polarization .",
    "the frequency range of existence is also broader .",
    "it is well known that at the ion time scale solitons evolve to states called postsolitons",
    ". these are slowly expanding cavities in the ion and electron densities which trap electromagnetic energy and produce fast ions @xcite .",
    "however , neglecting ion motion in our analysis is justified _ a posteriori _ , since the typical response time of the ions @xmath172 , where @xmath173 the ion mass , will be much larger than the typical period of oscillation @xmath174 for the solutions presented here .    in previous fluid @xcite and pic @xcite simulations",
    "solitary - wave - like structures were excited by a linearly polarized high - intensity laser pulse incident on a plasma slab . however , since the waves were excited spontaneously during the complex interaction , this method has difficulties to provide important information like the amplitude - frequency dispersion relation or the frequency domain of existence .",
    "in addition , it is not clear if the excited solutions in these studies correspond to exact solitary waves . from this point of view , the procedure followed in this work is advantageous , complements the information of the simulations and opens new possibilities .",
    "for instance , our fluid simulations , initialized with a single solitary wave , reveal that these coherent structures persist for long time and give insight on the stability problem .    since part of the electromagnetic energy is trapped inside the wave cavity , the solitary waves may play an important role in several applications like fast ignition in inertial confinement fusion .",
    "past simulations , experiments and theoretical works indicate that they are excited behind the laser pulse and they seem to be a fundamental component of the laser - plasma interaction at high intensities . a good understanding of some aspects , like the excitation process or solitary wave interactions , are relevant for these applications .",
    "these scenarios can be analyzed by preparing fluid or particle - in - cell codes initialized with the solutions here presented .",
    "an example of this technique applied to relativistic solitons was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where stability , collisions , electromagnetic bursts and post - soliton evolution of s - polarized 2-dimensional solitary waves were analyzed .",
    "the present analysis can be extended to find moving solitary waves solutions with linear polarization in the relativistic fluid model .",
    "the small amplitude limit of such solutions was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , thus suggesting that large amplitude waves may also exist .",
    "the results of this work , that would complete our knowledge on the organization of linearly polarized solitary waves , will be presented elsewhere ."
