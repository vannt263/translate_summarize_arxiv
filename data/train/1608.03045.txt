    "graphical model is a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships among many random variables .",
    "a central theme of graphical model research is to infer the structure of the underlying graph based on observational data . though significant progress has been made",
    ", existing works mainly focus on estimating the graph @xcite or testing the existence of a single edge @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a new inferential problem : testing the combinatorial structure of the underlying graph .",
    "examples include testing the graph connectivity , cycle presence , or assessing the maximum degree of the graph .",
    "unlike classical inference which aims at testing a set of euclidean parameters , combinatorial inference aims to test some global structural properties and requires the development of new methodology .",
    "as for methodological development , this paper mainly considers the gaussian graphical model ( though our method is applicable to the more general semiparametric exponential family graphical models and elliptical copula graphical models ) : let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-dimensional gaussian random vector with precision matrix @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be an undirected graph , where @xmath4 and an edge @xmath5 if and only if @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath7 has the pairwise markov property , i.e. , @xmath8 if and only if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are conditionally independent given the remaining variables . in a combinatorial inference problem , our goal is to test whether @xmath7 has certain global structural properties based on @xmath11 random samples @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath13 be the set of all graphs over the vertex set @xmath14 and @xmath15 be a pair of non - overlapping subsets of @xmath13 .",
    "we assume all the graphs in @xmath16 have a property ( e.g. , connectivity ) while the graphs in @xmath17 do not have this property .",
    "such a pair @xmath15 is called a sub - decomposition of @xmath13 .",
    "our goal is to test the hypothesis @xmath18 versus @xmath19 .",
    "we provide several concrete examples below .    * connectivity . *",
    "a graph is connected if and only if there exists a path connecting each pair of its vertices . to test connectivity , we set @xmath20 and @xmath21 . under the gaussian graphical model ,",
    "this is equivalent to testing whether the variables can be partitioned into at least two independent sets",
    ".    * cycle presence . *",

    ", we can translate the original problem of testing graphs to testing the precision matrix : @xmath32 in ( [ prec : matrix : prob ] ) , @xmath33 are two sets of precision matrices such that for all @xmath34 we have @xmath35 respectively , and @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37}\\|\\btheta_{*j}\\|_0 \\leq s\\}\\label{ms : def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some constants @xmath38 .",
    "the set @xmath36 restricts our attention to well conditioned symmetric matrices @xmath39 , whose induced graphs @xmath40 have maximum degree of at most @xmath41 . given this setup , we aim to characterize necessary conditions on the pair @xmath42 under which the combinatorial inference problem in ( [ prec : matrix : prob ] ) is _",

    "@xmath48 and the sub - decomposition @xmath49 ( recall that for all @xmath34 we have @xmath35 resp . ) , we anticipate that the sub - decomposition can capture the intrinsic challenge of the test in ( [ prec : matrix : prob ] ) .",
    "indeed , in sections [ sec : generic : lower ] and [ general : lower : bound ] we develop a new theory to characterize the impact of the combinatorial structures of @xmath17 and @xmath16 to the lower bound of the risk @xmath50 .",
    "such lower bounds provide necessary conditions for any valid test .",
    "we then develop practical procedures that match the obtained lower bounds . to understand how the sub - decomposition @xmath49 affects the intrinsic difficulty of the problem in ( [ prec : matrix : prob ] ) , we consider the three examples given before .",
    "our theory on lower bounds distinguishes between two types of sub - decompositions  in the first type one can find graphs belonging to @xmath17 and @xmath16 differing in only one single edge , while in the second type all graphs belonging to @xmath17 must differ on multiple edge sets from the graphs belonging to @xmath16 .",
    "one can check that in the first two examples ( connectivity and cycle presence testing ) there exist graphs belonging to @xmath17 and @xmath16 differing in only one single edge .",
    "for instance , when testing connectivity , consider a tree with a single edge removed ( thus it becomes a forest ) versus a connected tree . extending this intuition , for a fixed graph @xmath51 , we call the edge set @xmath52 a single - edge _ null - alternative separator _ ( nas ) if for all edges @xmath53 the graphs @xmath54 .",
    "intuitively the bigger the cardinality of a nas set is , the harder it is to tell the null from the alternatives . in section [ sec :",
    "generic : lower ] we detail that @xmath50 is asymptotically @xmath55 , when the signal strength of separation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is low ( see ( [ generic : s0:def ] ) and ( [ generic : s1:def ] ) for a formal definition ) and there exists a nas set with sufficiently large packing number .",
    "the packing number , formally defined in definition [ structure : entropy : packing ] , represents the cardinality of a subset of edges in @xmath56 which are `` far '' apart , where the proximity measure of two edges is a predistance based on the graph @xmath57 .",
    "recall that for a graph @xmath58 and two vertices @xmath59 and @xmath60 , a graph geodesic distance is defined by : @xmath61 using the notion of geodesic distance , one can define a predistance between two edges , by taking the minimum over the geodesic distances of their corresponding nodes .",
    "if the difference between null and alternative is more than one edge , as in the maximum degree testing @xmath27 vs @xmath28 for example , the packing number does not always capture the lower bound of the tests .",
    "in section [ general : lower : bound ] , we develop a novel mechanism to handle this more sophisticated case . we introduce a new concept called  buffer entropy \" which can produce sharper lower bounds to overcome the disadvantages of the packing number .    on the other hand , to match the lower bound , we propose the null - alternative witness technique ( nawt ) as a unified approach for combinatorial tests .",
    "the nawt identifies a critical structure and proceeds to test whether this structure indeed belongs to the true graph .",
    "we prove the nawt tests can control both the type i and type ii errors asymptotically .",
    "there are three major contributions of this paper .",
    "our first contribution is to develop a novel strategy for obtaining minimax lower bounds on the signal strength required to distinguish combinatorial graph structures which are separable via a single - edge nas .",
    "in particular , our theory bridges the information - theoretic lower bounds to the packing number of the nas set , which is an intuitive combinatorial quantity . to obtain this result",
    ", we relate the chi - square divergence between two probability measures to the number of  closed walks \" on their corresponding markov graphs .",
    "our analysis hinges on several technical tools including le cam s lemma , matrix perturbation inequalities and spectral graph theory .",
    "the usefulness of the approach is demonstrated by obtaining generic and interpretable lower bounds in numerous examples such as testing connectivity , connected components , self - avoiding paths , and cycles .",
    "our second contribution is to provide a device for proving lower bounds under the settings where the null and alternative graphs differ in multiple edges . under such case",
    ", the packing number does not always provide tight lower bounds .",
    "our technical device is based on a new graph combinatorial quantity called buffer entropy .",
    "the buffer entropy is a complexity measure of the structural tests and characterizes their lower bounds .",
    "we apply this device to derive lower bounds for testing the maximum degree and detecting a sparse clique .",
    "our third contribution is to propose a null - alternative witness technique ( nawt ) for testing ( [ prec : matrix : prob ] ) , which matches the lower bounds on the signal strength .",
    "the nawt is a two step procedure  in the first step it identifies a minimal structure witnessing the alternative hypothesis , and in the second step it attempts to certify the presence of this structure in the graph .",
    "nawt utilizes recent advances in high - dimensional inference and provides honest tests for combinatorial inference problems .",
    "it has two advantages compared to the support recovery procedures in @xcite : first , it allows us to control the type - i error at any given level ; second , it does not require us to perfectly recover the underlying graph to conduct valid inference .",
    "graphical model inference is relatively straightforward when @xmath62 , but becomes notoriously challenging when @xmath63 . in high - dimensions ,",
    "estimation procedures were studied by @xcite among others , while for variable selection procedures see @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , motivated by @xcite , various inferential methods for high - dimensional graphical models were suggested ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* e.g. ) , most of which focus on testing the presence of a single edge ( except @xcite who took the fdr approach @xcite to conduct multiple tests and @xcite who developed new procedures of edge testing in gaussian copula models ) .",
    "none of the aforementioned works address the problem of combinatorial structure testing .",
    "in addition to estimation and model selection procedures , efforts have been made to understand the fundamental limits of these problems .",
    "lower bounds on estimation were obtained by @xcite , where the authors show that the parametric estimation rate @xmath64 is unattainable unless @xmath65 .",
    "lower bounds on the minimal sample size required for model selection in ising models were established by @xcite , where it is shown that support recovery is unattainable when @xmath66 . in a follow up",
    "work , @xcite studied model selection limits on the sample size in gaussian graphical models .",
    "the latter two works are remotely related to ours , in that both works exploit graph properties to obtain information - theoretic lower bounds .",
    "however , our problem differs significantly from theirs since we focus on developing lower bounds for testing graph structure , which is a fundamentally different problem from estimating the whole graph .",
    "our problem is most closely related to those in @xcite , which are inspired by the large body of research on minimax hypothesis testing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) among many others . @xcite quantify the signal strength as the mean parameter of a standard gaussian distribution , while @xcite impose models on the covariance matrix of a multivariate gaussian distribution . in our setup the parameter spaces of interest are designed to reflect the graphical model structure , and hence the signal strength is naturally imposed on the precision matrix .",
    "@xcite address testing on a lattice based gaussian markov random field . for specific problems they establish lower bounds on the signal strength required to test the empty graph versus an alternative hypothesis .",
    "this is different from the setting of our problems , where the null hypothesis is usually not the empty graph .",
