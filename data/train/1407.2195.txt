    "in the decay of a polarized particle n with a spin @xmath2 to three or more particles with momenta @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  , t - odd angular correlation @xmath5)$ ] may arise .",
    "the correlation appears in the first order on the interaction which is responsible for the decay provided this interaction violates time reversal invariance ( tri ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "so , in particular , measurements of the amplitude d of the correlation @xmath6)$ ] in free neutron beta - decay , n@xmath7p+e+@xmath8 , are used for years to search tri - violating weak forces ( see @xcite for the best today s limit on d in the free neutron decay ) .    in the second order the  usual  forces ( so - called final - state interactions ) , which have nothing to do with tri violation , can generate t - odd angular correlations @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general , the detection of t - odd correlation @xmath5)$ ] in the decay of polarized particle n does not point out the tri violation .",
    "notice that the expected contributions of final - state interactions in free neutron decay are small in comparison with the current accuracy of measurement of the factor d @xcite (  false  tri - violating effects can also be separated from  true  ones owing to different dependence on energy of decay products ) .    in the first publications @xcite devoted to detection of t - odd angular correlation @xmath9)$ ] in ternary fission of nuclei @xmath0u by slow ( s - wave ) polarized neutrons , possible relation to tri violation has been allowed , therefore the above correlation was labelled as tri effect . here",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the spin of an incident neutron , the momenta of light fragment and @xmath13 particle ( see fig .",
    "the @xmath13 particle is emitted practically simultaneously with fragments at ternary nuclear fission .",
    "the compound nucleus @xmath14u@xmath15 is the decaying polarized particle n , and its spin @xmath16 is directed along the spin @xmath10 of the polarized neutron captured by the target nucleus @xmath0u .",
    "however , nowadays there is no doubt that t - odd correlations in ternary fission are caused by strong final - state interactions , therefore , they are not related to tri violation .",
    "unfortunately , the confusing label ",
    " still remains in use . in what follows ,",
    "we name the asymmetry that is related to the correlation @xmath9)\\equiv ( { \\bf p}_{\\alpha } [ { \\bf s}\\times { \\bf p}_{lf}])$ ] as t - effect ( transverse asymmetry , i.e. , asymmetry of @xmath13-particle emission with respect to the plane formed by the vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "right after the correlation @xmath9)$ ] was found , i have advanced a schematic explanation of the mechanism of its formation .",
    "it was shown that the asymmetry of @xmath13-particle emission can be caused by an interaction of spin @xmath17 of the system of two fragments separating from each other and the orbital momentum @xmath18 of already separated @xmath13 particle , i.e. , spin - orbit interaction @xmath19 .",
    "i discussed this hypothesis with the authors of the works @xcite , that is why the model of spin - orbit interaction was mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the most complete description of the model was presented at the conference in dubna in 2001 and published in its proceedings @xcite .",
    "a similar model based on the interaction @xmath19 , named , however ,  coriolis interaction  , was proposed by v.e .",
    "bunakov and s.g .",
    "kadmensky  @xcite .",
    "they first noted that the scheme @xcite  makes it possible , in principle , to calculate the asymmetry coefficient in ternary fission for alpha particles   , but later rejected it on the mistaken assumption ( groundlessly attributed to the author of @xcite )  that the spin @xmath17 can be replaced by the total spin of the nucleus undergoing fission , @xmath20   actually , i have assumed in @xcite that the initial orbital momentum @xmath18 of @xmath13 particle is small ( by the way , this smallness has been widely used in @xcite ) , therefore , @xmath21 and @xmath17 are approximately equal .",
    "thus , the arguments advanced in @xcite against the spin - orbit model are completely wrong .",
    "furthermore , the coriolis interaction exists only in a noninertial system of coordinates .",
    "meanwhile , the asymmetry of @xmath13-particle emission is observed in the inertial laboratory system and , hence , it is caused by the interaction that takes place in the inertial system .",
    "on the other hand , if in @xcite and @xcite the interaction @xmath19 is the same , so will be the conclusions .",
    "in particular , it was stated in @xcite :  no strong dependence of the asymmetry on the angle of @xmath13-particle emission with respect to the fission axis is predicted by the model in accordance with the experimental data  .",
    "then we find in @xcite :  the t - odd - asymmetry coefficient  will then be weakly dependent on the angle @xmath22 , and this is consistent with its experimental properties  .",
    "similarly , a crucial role of mixing of the states of @xmath13 particles with even and odd orbital momenta resulting from the charge asymmetry between light and heavy fragments was established in @xcite . in turn , the authors of @xcite come to the conclusion :  the proof of the fact that t - odd correlations in the ternary fission of nuclei arise only in fission modes that are asymmetric in fragment charges and masses is an important result of the present study  .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the angular correlation @xmath23)$ ] is not enough for description of t - effect .",
    "indeed , let us direct an axis @xmath24 along the vector  @xmath10 , an axis @xmath25 along the vector @xmath11 , so the vector @xmath26 $ ] is directed along an axis @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . the calculation @xcite gave the following expression for the angular and energy distributions of @xmath13  particles : @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are usual and associated legandre polynomials , @xmath34 is the polarization of compound nucleus with spin @xmath35 .",
    "explicit expressions for the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are presented in @xcite . in the second term at the right - hand side of eq.([1 ] ) the contributions from odd and even @xmath38 are separated ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ) .",
    "this second term results from the spin - orbit interaction and , being proportional to @xmath41 ( the angle @xmath42 on the plane @xmath43 is reckoned from the axis @xmath27  see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) describes the asymmetry of @xmath13-particle emission along ( @xmath44 ) and contrary ( @xmath45 ) to the axis @xmath27 , i.e. , t - effect .",
    "it is easy to see that only the first contribution to this term , corresponding to @xmath46 , gives the correlation @xmath47)$ ] , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are unit vectors along @xmath12 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "however , in general , the contributions from @xmath51 to the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are important in the same way as similar contributions to the function @xmath52 . indeed , the function @xmath52 describes a rather narrow angular distribution of @xmath13 particles with respect to the fission axis just due to account of a great number of contributions .    in real experiments ,",
    "@xmath13 particles are registered by detectors placed in the plane @xmath53 : detectors 1 and 2 are situated at the angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 to the axis @xmath25 in the positive side of the axis @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath56 , and detectors 3 and 4 are situated at the same angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 to the axis @xmath25 in the negative side of the axis @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath45 ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "thus , two different partial asymmetries of @xmath13-particle emission can be introduced : for the angle @xmath54 ( @xmath57 according to the detectors 1 and 3 ) and for the angle @xmath55 ( @xmath58 according to the detectors 2 and 4 ) . when the incident neutrons are not polarized , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "however , in this case the detectors 1 and 3 register more @xmath13 particles than the detectors  2 and 4 owing to coulomb repulsion that is stronger from the heavy fragment than from the light one , that is why the maximum of @xmath13-particle angular distribution is shifted to the angle @xmath61 .    in the measurements",
    "@xcite it was found that @xmath62 for target nuclei @xmath0u .",
    "this  fact caused the sceptical relation to the spin - orbit model .",
    "the point is that simplified semiclassical picture corresponding to this model ( see details in @xcite ) allows the following interpretation :   in case the spin - orbit interaction is at work , the correlation coefficient @xmath63 should have opposite signs for angles smaller or larger than the average angle 83@xmath64 ",
    "  @xcite .",
    "thus , according to the authors of @xcite , in the model with spin - orbit interaction one should expect @xmath65 .",
    "this scepticism , however , is absolutely unreasonable . using the realistic quantum model instead of naive semiclassical picture ,",
    "we obtain eqs.([1])-([4 ] ) , where @xmath66 hence , according to the data @xcite ( for the target nuclei @xmath0u ) the function @xmath39 dominates , while the function @xmath40 is suppressed for some reasons . in other words , t - effect , when , corresponds to dominance of @xmath39 and suppression of @xmath40 .",
    "however , for some other target nuclei one may expect the opposite situation : @xmath39 is suppressed , @xmath40  dominates , then @xmath65 in casual accordance with the semiclassical picture .",
    "the surprising thing is that this was found in the latter half of 2000 in ternary fission of nuclei @xmath1u by slow neutrons @xcite !",
    "unfortunately , the scepticism with respect to the spin - orbit model has not been revised .",
    "the authors of @xcite related the new type of asymmetry with nuclear  rotation  before scission and labelled it as  rot effect  .",
    "shorter label seems more preferable and will be used in what follows .",
    "obviously , r - effect , when @xmath65 , corresponds to suppression of @xmath39 and dominance of @xmath40 .",
    "it should be emphasized that eqs.([1])([4 ] ) describe both t - effect and r - effect , but they has been obtained in @xcite before the measurements @xcite were performed . in the general case ,",
    "the contributions from @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be of the same order ( both t - effect and r - effect will be observed ) .",
    "r - effect corresponds to t - odd angular correlation @xmath67 ) ( { \\bf p}_{\\alpha } { \\bf p}_{lf})$ ] .",
    "however , in general , this correlation is not enough for description of r - effect .",
    "indeed , let us take the first contribution to @xmath68 that corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "it has the form @xmath70)({\\bf n}_{\\alpha } { \\bf n}_{lf})$ ] .",
    "but the next contributions ( @xmath71 ) to @xmath40 may also be significant .",
    "spin @xmath17 of two fragments separating from each other transforms to the sum @xmath72 after scission , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are spins of light and heavy fragments , and @xmath75 is a relative orbital momentum .",
    "so , the question arises : what are the relative contributions to the spin - orbit interaction @xmath76 from different parts of @xmath17 after scission ?",
    "target spin effects in elastic scattering of @xmath77he on the adjacent nuclei @xmath78ni ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80co ( @xmath81 ) were studied in @xcite . significant difference in angular distributions in backward scattering",
    "was related to the interaction @xmath82 .",
    "however , later @xcite there was proposed another interpretation of these data .",
    "it was assumed that the ground state of odd nucleus , i.e. , @xmath80co , may be presented  as a single hole in an orbit @xmath83 coupled to states of the core with spin @xmath84 , where the core is taken to be the adjacent even nucleus  ,",
    "i.e. ,  @xmath78ni .",
    "thus , the wave function of the ground state of @xmath80co was expressed via the wave functions of ground and excited states of @xmath78ni ( see eq.(1 ) in @xcite ) , @xmath85 while for the elastic cross sections it was obtained ( see eq.(2 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath86 therefore , an enhancement of elastic scattering on the odd nucleus that has been found in  @xcite and interpreted there as manifestation of spin - orbit interaction @xmath82 can be explained by a scattering with virtual rotational excitation ( in particular , coulomb excitation ) of the even nucleus inside the odd one .",
    "obviously , such a mechanism can be called the effective interaction of the target spin @xmath87 and the relative orbital momentum  @xmath18 of the target and projectile particles .    in ternary fission , the coulomb repulsion between @xmath13 particle , on the one hand , and fragments , on the other hand , strongly influences the orbital momenta @xmath18 ( of @xmath13 particle with respect to the center of mass of two fragments ) and @xmath75 ( of two fragments ) and , thus ,",
    "may manifest itself as an effective @xmath88 interaction .",
    "this is a possible reply to the question posed at the beginning of this section .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the general expression for differential cross section of ternary fission which can be obtained in the framework of three - body approach with the use of hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "let @xmath89 be the position of the light fragment with respect to the heavy one , and @xmath90 be the position of the @xmath13 particle with respect to the center of mass of two fragments .",
    "the lengths of these vectors may be presented in the form @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the hyperradius and @xmath94 is the hyperangle .",
    "the three - body final state of two fragments and @xmath13 particle with definite quantum numbers , @xmath84 , @xmath95 , total spin @xmath96 of two fragments , total spin @xmath97 and hypermoment @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , may be described by the wave function that is proportional to hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "we consider here ternary fission of a target nucleus with spin @xmath100 induced by s - wave neutron with de broglie wave - length @xmath101 .",
    "differential cross section is of the form @xmath102 \\left(\\int\\limits_0^{\\pi/2 } ( \\sin\\vartheta)^{l+l'+2 } ( \\cos\\vartheta)^{l+l'+2 } p_n^{l+\\frac{1}{2},\\,l+\\frac{1}{2}}(\\cos 2\\vartheta ) p_{n'}^{l'+\\frac{1}{2},\\,l'+\\frac{1}{2}}(\\cos 2\\vartheta)\\,d\\vartheta\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 , @xmath104 are orientation spin - tensors for the incident neutrons ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the neutron polarization ) , @xmath108 are normalized racah functions , @xmath109 are elements of s - matrix ( transition amplitudes ) , @xmath110 , @xmath111  are jacobi polynomials , and @xmath112 are invariant spherical functions ( see @xcite ) .",
