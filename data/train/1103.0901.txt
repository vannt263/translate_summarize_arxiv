    "a classical question in these models is `` under which conditions on a probability measure does a single infinite @xmath2cluster necessarily occupy so much space that none is left for another infinite cluster ? '' .",
    "this question was analysed by a. gandolfi , m. keane and l. russo in @xcite .",
    "they showed that the existence of an infinite cluster of one type implies the finiteness of all clusters of the opposite type if the underlying probability measure on @xmath0 is ergodic , invariant under reflections in the coordinate axes , and positively associated in the following sense .",

    "the latter problem was addressed in full generality by burton and keane @xcite , who showed that merely translation invariance , together with the so - called finite energy condition , is sufficient for the existence of at most a single infinite cluster of a given type , either @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "note , however , that this result still allows the coexistence of an infinite @xmath1cluster and an infinite @xmath2cluster .",

    "this theorem admits a version which is closer to sheffield s theorem .",
    "once again , the formulation requires the definition of the boundary between an infinite @xmath1cluster and an infinite @xmath2cluster . to this end , consider the event that a single infinite @xmath1cluster and a single infinite @xmath2cluster exist . then fill the finite holes of the infinite @xmath2cluster ,",

    "given all this , the infinite boundary , which is illustrated on the right side of figure [ boundary ] , is then defined as the topological boundary of the union of these squares .",
    "note that , conditioned on the above coexistence event , the infinite boundary is always well - defined , since all nodes @xmath5adjacent to the infinite @xmath2cluster are contained in the infinite @xmath1cluster .",
    "furthermore , by definition , the infinite boundary indicates which side contains the infinite @xmath1cluster and differs from sheffield s boundary between a single infinite @xmath1cluster and a single infinite @xmath4cluster .",
    "we usually interpret the infinite boundary as a curve .",
    "[ mu ] there exists no probability measure @xmath28 on @xmath24 which possesses all of the following properties :    * @xmath29 is positively associated ; * @xmath29-almost surely there exists a single infinite @xmath1cluster ; * @xmath29-almost surely there exists at most one infinite @xmath2cluster ; * the distribution of the infinite boundary  conditioned on its existence  is translation - invariant ; * with positive probability there exists an infinite @xmath2cluster .",
    "the proof of these theorems requires only some fairly general properties of the matching pair @xmath30 . as a consequence , we could replace @xmath30 by any matching pair @xmath31 with an underlying periodic mosaic @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are also periodic graphs . for the definition and a detailed discussion of matching pairs we refer to @xcite .",
    "the burton - keane uniqueness theorem , together with theorem [ mu ] , implies our second result , namely the next corollary , which corresponds to the theorem of gandolfi , keane and russo . in place of any kind of invariance under reflections or rotations , it takes advantage of the finite energy condition .",
    "[ rho ] let @xmath35 be an ergodic and positively associated probability measure on @xmath24 satisfying the finite energy condition .",
    "then the @xmath35-probability of coexistence of an infinite @xmath2cluster and an infinite @xmath1cluster is zero .    as the assumption of positive association is often difficult to verify or does not hold at all , our third result analyses the structure of the event that an infinite @xmath1cluster or an infinite @xmath2cluster exist under the sole condition of bounded energy .",
    "[ nu ] let @xmath36 be a probability measure on @xmath24 satisfying the bounded energy condition . then , @xmath36-almost surely on the event that an infinite @xmath2cluster exists , one can find infinitely many disjoint infinite self - avoiding @xmath2paths .",
    "analogously , infinitely many disjoint infinite self - avoiding @xmath1paths exist if an infinite @xmath1cluster exists .",
    "if we assume  in addition to the bounded energy ",
    "the coexistence and uniqueness of the infinite @xmath1cluster and the infinite @xmath2cluster , then theorem [ nu ] even yields the existence of infinitely many two - sided infinite self - avoiding @xmath2paths .",
    "these two - sided infinite @xmath2paths exhibit a natural order .",
    "the first one @xmath37 is contained in the boundary of the infinite @xmath1cluster .",
    "the second of these two - sided infinite @xmath2paths is contained in the boundary of the union of @xmath37 , the infinite @xmath1cluster , and all finite @xmath1clusters adjacent to @xmath37 . since there",
    "exist infinitely many self - avoiding @xmath2paths , this procedure can be continued indefinitely .",
    "so , the infinite @xmath2cluster looks like wall bars . an analogous statement holds for the infinite @xmath1cluster and the lattice splitts into one @xmath2wall bars and one @xmath1wall bars .    apart from that , theorem [ nu ] could also be useful as a first step towards a proof by contradiction of an analog of corollary [ rho ] which dispenses with positive association .",
    "if both the bounded energy condition and ergodicity hold , it seems to be counterintuitive that unique infinite clusters of both types coexist . for , on the one hand , the infinite @xmath1cluster is not allowed to intersect the intermediate space between the first and the @xmath38th two - sided infinite @xmath2path as above , which has infinite `` length '' and `` width '' at least @xmath38 . on the other hand , ergodicity suggests that the infinite @xmath1cluster should be evenly spread over @xmath3 .",
    "this intuition can be made rigorous under the further assumption of negative association , which means that any two increasing events are negatively correlated .",
    "namely , subdivide the lattice into squares of the same size such that these squares can be interpreted as nodes of a new lattice . call two squares adjacent if their distance is one . furthermore , call a square occupied if it is met by the infinite @xmath1cluster ; otherwise it is called vacant . given the coexistence ,",
    "the size of the squares can be chosen so large that by exploiting the negative association , a standard path counting argument shows the finiteness of all vacant square - clusters .",
    "let @xmath39 be a number that exceeds the diameter of the squares . a two - sided infinite self - avoiding square - path is formed by the squares that are hit by the @xmath40th two - sided infinite self - avoiding @xmath2path . by choice of @xmath39 , these squares are contained in the random set of nodes between the first and the @xmath41th two - sided infinite self - avoiding @xmath2path .",
    "therefore , all of them are necessarily vacant , which is impossible because all clusters of vacant squares are finite .",
    "once again , the proof of theorem [ nu ] only uses some fairly general properties of the matching pair @xmath30 .",
    "so the proof also works for any matching pair @xmath31 with an underlying planar mosaic @xmath32 that satisfies the following two conditions : the number of edges encircling a face is bounded , and the number of nodes adjacent to a node is bounded .",
    "furthermore , the proof of the third result also works for higher dimensions .",
    "in this section we establish some basic notations needed throughout the paper .",
    "our underlying set of nodes is always @xmath3 .",
