    "a problem of much current interest in quantum field theory ( qft ) is the renormalization group ( rg ) flow between different boundary fixed points of a conformal field theory ( cft ) that remains conformal in the bulk .",

    "in addition , approximate numerical scaling energies can be explored by use of the truncated conformal space approach ( tcsa )  @xcite .    in this letter , for boundary flows , we show how one can derive exact tba equations  @xcite for all excitations from a lattice approach  @xcite .",

    "the physical direction of the flow from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) is given by the relevant perturbations and is consistent with the @xmath24-theorem  @xcite which asserts that the boundary entropy is reduced under the flow @xmath25 .",

    "the approach outlined here , however , is quite general and should apply , for example , to all integrable boundary flows of minimal models  @xcite .",

    "it has been shown by behrend and pearce  @xcite that at criticality there exist integrable boundary conditions associated with each conformal boundary condition @xmath10 carrying 0,1 or 2 arbitrary boundary fields @xmath31 . in the present case the boundaries @xmath32 and @xmath33 admit no fields , @xmath34 and @xmath35 admit a single field @xmath1 and @xmath36 admits two boundary fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "sufficiently large , there can be only simple zeros in the middle of each strip ( 1-strings ) or pairs of zeros located on the two borders of each strip , having the same imaginary part ( 2-strings ) . because of crossing symmetry , all the zeros appear in complex conjugate pairs so the upper and lower half planes are related by reflection in the real axis and this remains true for general values of @xmath56 .",
    "the patterns of zeros are classified  @xcite by string content and ordering .",
    "let @xmath57 be the number of 1-strings in the upper half plane in strips 1 and 2 and similarly @xmath58 the number of 2-strings .",

    ", we have @xmath62 with @xmath63 . for given string content , the relative ordering of 1- and 2- strings",
    "is given by the quantum numbers @xmath64 where , for the 1-string @xmath65 , @xmath64 is the number of two - strings whose location @xmath66 is larger ( further from the real axis ) than @xmath67 .",
    "labelling the strings so that @xmath68 , the quantum numbers must satisfy @xmath69 in @xmath19 with @xmath70 there is a frozen 1-string , that is , the 1-string furthest from the real axis in strip  1 is restricted to have no two - strings above it so that @xmath71 . with these quantum numbers , the states are uniquely labelled as @xmath72 in the scaling limit",

    "these all involve the farthest zeros ( 1 or 2 strings ) from the real axis in the upper half plane and are well supported by numerical analysis of the tba equations in section  5 .",
