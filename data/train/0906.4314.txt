    "banica and bisch @xcite studied the spectral measures of bipartite graphs , particularly those of norm less than two , the @xmath1 graphs , and those of norm two , their affine versions associated with subgroups of @xmath2 . here and in a sequel @xcite we look at such spectral measures in a wider context , particularly from the viewpoint of associating spectral measures to nimreps ( non - negative integer matrix representations ) .",
    "@xmath1 graphs appear in the classification of non - negative integer matrices with norm less than two @xcite .",
    "their affine version @xmath3 classify the finite subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1 graphs are also relevant for the classification of subfactors with jones index less than 4 , but only @xmath4 appear as principal graphs ( @xcite or see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however all appear in the classification of @xmath2 modular invariants by cappelli , itzykson and zuber @xcite , and in their realisation by @xmath2 braided subfactors @xcite .",
    "the verlinde algebra of @xmath5 at level @xmath6 is represented by a non - degenerately braided system of endomorphisms @xmath7 on a type @xmath8 factor @xmath9 , whose fusion rules @xmath10 reproduce exactly those of the positive energy representations of the loop group of @xmath5 at level @xmath6 , @xmath11 and whose statistics generators @xmath12 , @xmath13 obtained from the braided tensor category @xmath7 match exactly those of the kac - peterson modular @xmath12 , @xmath13 matrices which perform the conformal character transformations @xcite .",
    "this family @xmath14 of commuting normal matrices can be simultaneously diagonalised : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the trivial representation .",
    "the intriguing aspect being that the eigenvalues @xmath17 and eigenvectors @xmath18 are described by the modular @xmath12 matrix .",
    "a braided subfactor is an inclusion @xmath19 where the dual canonical endomorphism decomposes as a finite combination of elements of the verlinde algebra , endomorphisms in @xmath7 .",
    "such subfactors yield modular invariants through the procedure of @xmath20-induction which allows two extensions of @xmath21 on @xmath9 , depending on the use of the braiding or its opposite , to endomorphisms @xmath22 of @xmath23 , so that the matrix @xmath24 is a modular invariant @xcite .",
    "the classification of cappelli , itzykson and zuber of @xmath2 modular invariants is understood via the action of the @xmath9-@xmath9 sectors @xmath7 on the @xmath23-@xmath9 sectors @xmath25 and produces a nimrep @xmath26 whose spectrum reproduces exactly the diagonal part of the modular invariant , i.e. @xmath27 with the spectrum of @xmath28 with multiplicity @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "every @xmath2 modular invariant can be realised by @xmath20-induction for a suitable braided subfactor .",
    "evaluating the nimrep @xmath30 at the fundamental representation @xmath31 , we obtain for each such inclusion a matrix @xmath32 which recovers the @xmath1 classification of cappelli , itzykson and zuber .",
    "since these @xmath1 graphs can be matched to the affine dynkin diagrams , the mckay graphs of the finite subgroups of @xmath2 , di francesco and zuber @xcite were guided to find candidates for classifying graphs for @xmath0 modular invariants by first considering the mckay graphs of the finite subgroups of @xmath0 to produce a candidate list of graphs whose spectra described the diagonal part of the modular invariant .",
    "ocneanu claimed @xcite that all @xmath0 modular invariants were realised by subfactors and this was shown in @xcite .",
    "the nimrep associated to the conjugate moore - seiberg modular invariant @xmath33 was not computed however in @xcite . to summarize",
    ", we can realize all @xmath0 modular invariants , but there is mismatch between the list of nimreps associated to each modular invariant and the mckay graphs of the finite subgroups of @xmath0 which are also the nimreps of the representation theory of the group . both of these kinds of nimreps will play a role in this paper and its sequel @xcite .",
    "these nimreps also have a diagonalisation as in ( [ eqn : verlinde_formula ] ) with diagonalising matrix @xmath34 usually non - symmetric , where @xmath35 labels conjugacy classes , and @xmath36 the irreducible characters ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.7 ) and section [ sect : spectral_measures_for_subgroup_su(2 ) ] ) .",
    "we compute here the spectral measures of nimreps of braided subfactors associated to @xmath2 and @xmath0 and nimreps for the representations of subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "the case of subgroups of @xmath0 will be treated separately @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath37 is a unital @xmath38-algebra with state @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 is a normal operator then there exists a compactly supported probability measure @xmath41 on the spectrum @xmath42 of @xmath43 , uniquely determined by its moments @xmath44 for non - negative integers @xmath45 , @xmath46 . if @xmath47 is self - adjoint ( [ eqn : moments_normal_operator ] ) reduces to @xmath48 with @xmath49 , for any non - negative integer @xmath45 .",
    "the generating series of the moments of @xmath47 is the stieltjes transform @xmath50 of @xmath51 , given by @xmath52 what we compute are such spectral measures and generating series when @xmath43 is the normal operator @xmath53 acting on the hilbert space of square summable functions on the graph .",
    "in particular we can understand the spectral measures for the torus @xmath54 and @xmath2 as follows . if @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the self adjoint operators arising from the mckay graph of the fusion rules of the representation theory of @xmath54 and @xmath2 , then the spectral measures in the vacuum state can be describe in terms of semicircular law , on the interval @xmath57 $ ] which is the spectrum of either as the image of the map @xmath58 : @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote binomial coefficients and catalan numbers respectively .",
    "the spectral weight for @xmath2 arises from the jacobian of a change of variable between the interval @xmath57 $ ] and the circle .",
    "then for @xmath63 and @xmath0 , the deltoid @xmath64 in the complex plane which is the image of the two - torus under the map @xmath65 is the spectrum of the corresponding normal operators on the hilbert spaces of the fusion graphs .",
    "the corresponding spectral measures are then described by a corresponding jacobian or discriminant as : @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the lebesgue measure on @xmath69 .",
    "then for the other graphs , the quantum graphs , the spectral measures distill onto very special subsets of the semicircle / circle , torus / deltoid and the theory of nimreps allows us to compute these measures precisely . for the case of finite subgroups ,",
    "this nimrep approach clearly shows why banica and bisch were recovering the kostant polynomials for finite subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "we are also going to compute various hilbert series of dimensions associated to @xmath1 models . in the @xmath2 case",
    "this corresponds to the study of the mckay correspondence @xcite , kostant polynomials of @xcite , the @xmath13-series of @xcite , and the study of pre - projective algebras @xcite .",
    "the classical mckay correspondence relates finite subgroups @xmath70 of @xmath2 with the algebraic geometry of the quotient kleinian singularities @xmath71 but also with the classification of @xmath2 modular invariants , classification of subfactors of index less than 4 , and quantum subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 theory is related to the ads - cft correspondence and the calabi - yau algebras arising in the geometry of calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "we take the superpotentials built on the @xmath1 perron - frobenius weights and the @xmath72 cells @xcite and corresponding associated algebraic structures and study the hilbert series of dimensions of corresponding algebras .",
    "if @xmath73 is the matrix of dimensions of paths of length @xmath46 in a graph @xmath74 in the pre - projective algebra @xmath75 , with indices labeled by the vertices , then the matrix hilbert series @xmath76 of the pre - projective algebra is defined as @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the adjacency matrix of @xmath74 . then if @xmath74 is a finite ( unoriented ) graph which is not an @xmath79 graph ( where @xmath13 denotes the tadpole graph @xmath80 ) , then @xmath81 , whilst if @xmath74 is an @xmath79 graph , then @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the coxeter number of @xmath74 and @xmath84 is the permutation matrix corresponding to an involution of the vertices of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the dual @xmath85 is a @xmath75-@xmath75 bimodule , not usually identified with @xmath86 or @xmath87 with trivial right and left actions but with @xmath88 with trivial left action and the right action twisted by an automorphism , the nakayama automorphism @xmath89 .",
    "the nakayama automorphism measures how far away @xmath75 is from being symmetric . in the case of a pre - projective algebra of dynkin quiver , this nakayama automorphism",
    "is identified with an involution on the underlying dynkin diagram .",
    "more precisely it is trivial in all cases , except for the dynkin diagrams @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 where it is the unique non - trivial involution .",
    "bocklandt @xcite has studied the types of quivers and relations ( superpotentials ) that appear in graded calabi - yau algebras of dimension 3 .",
    "indeed he also points out that the zero - dimensional case consists of semi - simple algebras , i.e. quivers without arrows , the one dimensional case consists of direct sums of one - vertex - one - loop quivers . moreover , a calabi - yau algebra of dimension 2 is the pre - projective algebra of a non - dynkin quiver .",
    "the examples coming from finite subgroups of @xmath0 give calabi - yau algebras of dimension three ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.4.6 ) .",
    "we are not only interested in the fusion graphs of finite subgroups of @xmath0 , whose adjacency matrices have norm 3 , but in the fusion @xmath72 nimrep graphs arising in our subfactor setting as describing the @xmath0 modular invariants through @xmath23-@xmath9 systems which have norm less than 3 .",
    "the figures for the complete list of the @xmath72 graphs are given in @xcite .",
    "unlike for @xmath2 , there is no precise relation between finite subgroups of @xmath0 and @xmath0-modular invariants . for @xmath2 an affine dynkin diagram describing the mckay graph of a finite subgroup gives rise to a dynkin diagram describing a nimrep of a modular invariant by removing one vertex and the edges which have this vertex as an endpoint . for @xmath0 , di francesco and zuber @xcite",
    "used this procedure as a guide to find nimreps for some @xmath0-modular invariants by removing vertices from some mckay graphs of finite subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "however , not all finite subgroups were utilised , and not all nimreps or modular invariants can be found from a finite subgroup .",
    "the spectral measures for the @xmath1 graphs were computed in terms of probability measures on the circle @xmath54 in @xcite . in section [",
    "sect : spec_measure - ade ] we recover their results via a different method , which depends on the fact that the @xmath1 graphs are nimrep graphs .",
    "this method can then be generalized to @xmath0 , which we do in section [ sect : spec_measuresu(3)ade ] , and in particular obtain spectral measures for the infinite graphs @xmath93 and @xmath94 corresponding to the representation graphs of the fixed point algebra of @xmath95 under the action of @xmath63 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "we also obtain the spectral measure for the finite graphs @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : hilbert - su(3 ) ] we consider the hilbert series of the dimensions of the associated pre - projective algebras .",
    "the final section depends on the existence of the cells @xcite ( essentially the square roots of the boltzmann weights ) and to some degree on their explicit values computed in @xcite .",
    "the theory of modular invariants constructed from braided subfactors @xcite also provides us with nimreps associated to @xmath0 modular invariants .",
    "it was announced by ocneanu @xcite and shown in @xcite that every @xmath0 modular invariant is realised by a braided subfactor .",
    "in this section we will compute the spectral measures for the @xmath1 dynkin diagrams and their affine counterparts .",
    "we will present a method for computing these spectral measures using the fact that the graphs are nimrep graphs .",
    "this method recovers the measures given in @xcite and will allow for an easy generalization to the case of @xmath0 and associated nimrep graphs .",
    "a graph is called locally finite if each vertex is the start or endpoint for a finite number of edges .",
    "let @xmath74 be any locally finite bipartite graph , with a distinguished vertex labelled @xmath101 and bounded adjacency matrix @xmath78 regarded as an operator on @xmath102 , where @xmath103 denotes the vertices of @xmath74 .",
