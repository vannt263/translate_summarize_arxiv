    "many of these studies are still based on idealized models which neglect the effect of disorder and particle - particle interactions .",
    "the understanding of the origin and effects of extrinsic disorder , as well as interactions in graphene seems to be essential in understanding the experiments and also in designing graphene - based electronic devices .",
    "+ the failure of the random - phase approximation @xcite , leads one to employ some non - perturbative methods to investigate the effect of particle - particle interaction and disorder in graphene .",
    "an important observation that needs such a method is the appearance of strong carrier density inhomogeneity with density fluctuations much larger than the average density of the system for low densities @xcite , i.e. electron - hole puddles ( ehps ) .",
    "ehps were theoretically predicted by hwang _",
    "et al _ @xcite and adam _ et al _ @xcite as the phase of low carrier density .",
    "the existence of these inhomogeneities , characterized by strong electron density fluctuations , were also confirmed in experiments in the vicinity of the dirac point @xcite .",

    "an interesting observation was made : the rippling of graphene are independent of the charge density inhomogeneities , i.e. ehps @xcite . it was also observed that the spatial extension of puddles is @xmath1 nm @xcite , consistent with the micro - scale experiment of martin _ et al .",

    "it has been proposed that such inhomogeneity dominates the graphene physics at low ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) carrier densities @xcite in which self - consistent thomas - fermi - dirac ( tfd ) theory was employed to simulate the graphene charge profile on the sio@xmath4 substrate .",
    "the ultimate limit ( zero chemical potential ) is expected contain very different physics relative to high - density limit , since the charge fluctuation is maximal in this limit , which is not understood properly yet .",

    "the characterization of these surfaces is via determining various exponents and distribution functions .",
    "there are increasing numerical and experimental evidences that many physical phenomena often show scaling relations from the statistical point of view @xcite . identifying scale invariance symmetry is one of the most important problem of the statistical physics of fluctuating systems , i.e. rough surfaces and surface growth processes @xcite , and many other random fluctuating systems .",
    "recently , it was suggested that iso - height lines in these types of random fluctuating fields in @xmath5 dimensions are scale invariant and their size distribution is characterized by a few scaling functions and scaling exponents @xcite .",
    "what we are going to do in this paper is confirming this idea for the contour lines of the electron - hole density in graphene .",

    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the model and obtain the probability measure of carrier density in weak coupling limit . in the third section we will fix the notation and introduce different scaling behaviors and scaling exponents corresponding to the contour loop ensembles . in the fourth section",
    "we will numerically measure the proposed scaling exponents for the disorder potential and the carrier density in graphene , and we will check the universality of those relations . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize the obtained results and our conclusions .",
    "the experimental observation of ehps is the base of many density - based theories searching for the electronic properties of graphene which is the main motivation of the present paper .",
    "besides the subtleties concerning experimental characterization of mono - layer graphene ( mlg ) @xcite and bi - layer graphene ( blg ) @xcite , the coexistence of interaction and ( in - plane and out - plane ) disorder makes this system less tractable theoretically @xcite .",
    "many theoretical attempts have been made to capture the electronic structure of graphene in the presence of disrder , especially the physics of ehps @xcite , each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses , for review see @xcite . despite this theoretical background , an overall characterization of the ehps , especially at the scale - invariant ( zero - gate ) lavel is missing yet . in this section",

    "such a characterization has not been done for graphene . + by analyzing the width in density of the incompressible bands in the quantum hall regime and fitting the broadened incompressible bands with gaussian distribution , martin _ et al . _",
    "extracted the value of the amplitude of the density fluctuations to be @xmath15 . by calculating the density fluctuations in two ways , namely the probability distribution of the density extracted from the imaging results and the broadening of the incompressible bands in the quantum hall regime , martin _ et al .",
    "_ found that the upper bound for the characteristic length of the density fluctuations is @xmath16 nm , consistent with the theoretical results @xcite .",
    "note that in this regime the density fluctuations are much larger than the mean electron density , signaling a different phase from the homogeneous ( dirac ) electron gas . in this phase the translational symmetry of the system",
    "is broken by forming puddles of electrons and holes , i.e. ehps .",
    "+ ehps has been observed and analyzed further using other ( direct and indirect ) techniques @xcite .",
    "the first stm experiments on exfoliated graphene showed that in current exfoliated graphene samples the rippling of graphene are independent of the charge density inhomogeneities , i.e. ehps @xcite .",

    "comparing this with the results of @xmath0 map , deshpande _",
    "_ showed once again this independence .",
    "the more quality investigations show the same results @xcite .      treating simultaneously particle - particle interaction and disorder on an equal footing",

    "this _ exchange - driven _ dirac - point logarithmic singularity in the fermi velocity in the intrinsic graphene is shown to disappear in the extrinsic case @xcite .",
    "this logarithmic enhancement of fermi velocity leads the specific heat to be logarithmically suppressed relative to its non - interacting counterpart @xcite .",
    "there are many other evidences showing that the band chirality in graphene changes substantially the role of particle - particle interaction with respect to the usual 2d electron gas and the vital ( unusual ) role of the exchange and correlation energies .",
    "the enhancement of screening by means of the exchange and correlation in graphene @xcite , in contrast to the usual cases , is an example .",
    "the other example is the suppression of spin and charge susceptibilities which is attributed to the enhancement of net chirality due to coulomb interactions in lightly doped graphene @xcite , as well as the enhancement of screening effect @xcite .",
    "the opposite dependence of exchange - correlation energy to the charge density with respect to parabolic band 2d electron gas is also a source of many differences of graphene from the other systems .",
    "while the later favors inhomogeneous densities , the former increases the energy cost of density increases , favouring more homogeneous densities and enhancing screening .",
    "+ the source of disorder and its relevance in the electronic structure of graphene is also an important question to be addressed .",
    "the approximately linear dependence of conductivity on carrier density in graphene sheets @xcite indicates that the remote coulomb impurities are dominant disorder source in most graphene samples .",
    "the experimental observation that the spatial pattern of ehps is not correlated with the topography of the graphene sheets ( described in the previous subsection ) is another evidence that the remote charges are the dominant disorder source @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of coulomb disorder in graphene in the absence of particle - particle interaction were studied by fogler _",

    "the disorder in addition to being the main sources of scattering has an additional effect ; it locally shifts the dirac point .",
    "it means that even at the zero gate voltage , the fermi energy is moved to positive or negative values with respect to the charge neutrality ( dirac ) point .",
    "the other sources of scattering are ripples @xcite and point defects ( which is responsible for high - density saturation of conductivity @xcite ) which are not considered in this paper .",
