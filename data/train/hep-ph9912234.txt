    "understanding the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath1s ) remains one of the most challenging non - perturbative problems of qcd .",

    "it is generally expected that if @xmath0 increases ( keeping the number of colours @xmath3 fixed ) , the theory meets phase transitions and the chiral symmetry is eventually restored .",
    "the argument is originally based on properties of the qcd @xmath4-function in perturbation theory .",
    "the well - known statement of the `` end of asymptotic freedom '' for @xmath5 @xcite has been further completed by the analysis of the so - called `` conformal window ''",

    "less perturbative and more model - dependent investigations , based on a gap equation @xcite or on a `` liquid instanton model '' @xcite , also indicate that a chiral phase transition could occur for @xmath0 substantially below @xmath8 .",
    "it is important to understand , at least qualitatively , the non - perturbative origin of the suppression of chiral order parameters for an increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we have recently argued @xcite that such a suppression might result from a paramagnetic effect of light ( massless ) quark loops @xcite , i.e. it could be due to `` sea quarks '' and , consequently , it could escape a detection in quenched lattice simulations , or in any other approach neglecting the fermion determinant . an appropriate framework to develop these ideas and",
    "to ask precise questions is the formulation of qcd in an euclidean box @xmath9 , with periodic ( antiperiodic ) boundary conditions for gluon ( fermion ) fields , up to a gauge transformation . in this framework , the sb@xmath1s pattern is reflected by the dynamics of lowest eigenvalues of the dirac operator : @xmath10=\\gamma_\\mu(\\partial_\\mu+ig_\\mu ) .",

    "positive eigenvalues @xmath12 are labeled in ascending order by a positive integer ( one further denotes @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the corresponding eigenvectors ) .",
    "sb@xmath1s is related to a particularly dense accumulation of eigenvalues around zero @xcite .",
    "models of such an accumulation in terms of random matrices @xcite or instantons @xcite have been proposed .",
    "some chiral order parameters are entirely dominated by the infrared extremity of the spectrum of the dirac operator ( [ diracoper ] ) .",
    "this makes them particularly sensitive to the statistical weight given to smallest dirac eigenvalues in the functional integral , which is suppressed in the massless limit by the @xmath0-th power of the fermion determinant .",
    "a good example is the quark condensate , defined by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 denote the @xmath0 lightest quark masses and @xmath18 represents the lightest quark field .",
    "@xmath19 receives exclusive contributions from the smallest dirac eigenvalues that behave in average as @xmath20 , and it is consequently expected to be the most sensitive order parameter to the variation of @xmath0 and to a phase transition .",
    "other order parameters are less sensitive , like @xmath21 , defined as the @xmath22 limit of the coupling of the goldstone bosons to the axial current : @xmath23 @xmath21 may be non - zero due to dirac eigenvalues accumulating as @xmath24 @xcite . for this reason , @xmath21 should exhibit a weaker @xmath0-dependence than @xmath19 .",
    "finally , observables with no particular sensitivity to the infrared edge of the dirac spectrum ( @xmath25-mass , string tension , etc  ) have no reason to be strongly affected by the fermion determinant and by the @xmath0-dependence .",
    "let us first consider the thermodynamical limit and denote by @xmath26 the critical value of @xmath0 at which the first chiral phase transition takes place .",
    "just below @xmath26 , the order parameter @xmath19 drops out , whereas its fluctuations may be expected to become important .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the latter would manifest itself by an enhancement of the zweig - rule violation just in the vacuum channel @xmath27 .",
    "an important zweig - rule violation is precisely observed in the scalar channel @xcite , and nowhere else ( with the exception of the pseudoscalar channel driven by the axial anomaly ) . whilst the signature of a nearby phase transition is rather clear just below @xmath26 , it is more speculative and ambiguous above the critical point .",
    "first , above @xmath26 , colour might still be confined ( confinement has no obvious relation to small dirac eigenvalues ) .",
    "second , despite @xmath28 , the chiral symmetry need not be completely restored .",
    "the goldstone bosons coupling to conserved axial currents with the strength @xmath29 might survive to the @xmath0-induced phase transition .",
    "this is reflected by the possibility that the @xmath0-sensitivity and suppression of the order parameter @xmath21 might be considerably weaker than in the case of the quark condensate @xcite .",
    "of course , this is a highly non - trivial possibility , which presumably depends on the existence of a non - perturbative fixed point in the renormalization group flow would imply @xmath30 , i.e. the full symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "this argument is however based on an inequality for which it is by no means obvious that it survives in the full renormalized theory . ] .",
    "here , we take as a working hypothesis that above @xmath26 , a partial sb@xmath1s still occurs , due to @xmath31 . the results of our paper allow , in particular , to test this hypothesis .",
    "the central question remains how far is @xmath26 ( for @xmath7 ) from the real world , in which the number of light quarks hardly exceeds @xmath32 .",
    "some recent investigations actually indicate that @xmath33 could be rather small , and/or that the real world could already feel the influence of a nearby phase transition .",
    "first , some lattice simulations with dynamical fermions observe a strong @xmath0-dependence of sb@xmath1s signals for @xmath0 as low as 4 - 6 @xcite .",
    "second , a method based on a well - convergent chiral sum rule has been proposed , which allows to study phenomenologically the variation of @xmath19 for small @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has been found that existing experimental information on the zweig - rule violation in the scalar channel leads to a large reduction of @xmath19 already between @xmath2 and @xmath34 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze in a model - independent way how @xmath0-induced chiral phase transitions manifest themselves in the finite - volume partition function . in particular",

    "for @xmath36 , the leading large - volume behaviour of such inverse moments has been worked out in details by leutwyler and smilga @xcite . in order to investigate how this result is modified in the vicinity and above @xmath26",
    ", we rely on the basic observations and methods of ref .  @xcite . for large sizes of the box ( @xmath37 with @xmath38 gev ) ,",
    "heavy excitations are exponentially suppressed in the partition function , which is then dominated by the lightest states , the pseudo - goldstone bosons of sb@xmath1s .",
    "this leads to an effective description in terms of the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt ) @xcite , and it can be matched with qcd , yielding the desired information concerning the infrared properties of the dirac spectrum .",
    "moreover , the effective lagrangian is identical to its infinite - volume counterpart , provided that periodic boundary conditions are used @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 lies far below @xmath26 , the quark condensate is large and @xmath39 behaves at large ( but finite ) volumes according to the asymptotic behaviour derived by leutwyler and smilga @xcite , using standard @xmath1pt @xcite . above @xmath26 , the quark condensate vanishes , and the previous analysis can not be applied . however ,",
    "if chiral symmetry is still partially broken , the matching with @xmath1pt remains possible and it leads to a clear - cut change in the large - volume behaviour of @xmath39 : expressed through their inverse moments , the average behaviour of the lowest eigenvalues for @xmath40 should turn from @xmath20 ( @xmath41 ) into @xmath24 @xmath42 @xcite . when we approach the critical point with @xmath0 near but under @xmath26 , significant discrepancies from the asymptotic limit @xmath40 could be seen for large but finite boxes .",
    "the latter should then be analyzed using the framework of generalized @xmath1pt @xcite .",
    "we have clearly in mind the possibility to use unquenched lattice simulations , varying @xmath0 and ( finite ) lattice size @xmath43 to eventually detect chiral phase transitions , through the volume dependence of inverse moments ( [ invmom ] ) .",

    "<S> in the framework of euclidean qcd on a torus , we study the spectrum of the dirac operator through inverse moments of its eigenvalues , averaged over topological sets of gluonic configurations . the large - volume dependence of these sums is related to chiral order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we sketch how these results may be applied to lattice simulations in order to investigate the chiral phase transitions occurring when @xmath0 increases . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate how dirac inverse moments at different volumes could be compared to detect in a clean way the phase transition triggered by the suppression of the quark condensate and by the enhancement of the zweig - rule violation in the vacuum channel .    </S>",
