    "the spiral galaxy m51 ( ngc 5194 , the whirlpool nebula ) and its peculiar companion galaxy ngc 5195 form a typical example of galaxy interactions . after the pioneering hydrodynamical simulations by toomre and toomre ( 1972 ) ,",
    "several authors have tried to explain the grand design spiral shape and the tidal arms of this interacting system .",
    "hernquist ( 1990 ) and barnes ( 1998 ) have critically discussed the successes and the problems of explaining the morphology of the ngc 5194/5195 system , in particular the radial velocities of the two galaxies , the two - armed spiral structure of m51 , the connecting tidal arm and the large hi arm .",
    "the best model is found for a relative orbit that is almost in the plane of m51 , for a mass ratio of ngc 5194/5195 @xmath21 , a pericenter distance of 17 to 20 kpc and a time since pericenter of @xmath22 yrs ( barnes 1998 ) .",
    "the ngc 5194/5195 system is ideally suited for the study of triggered star formation due to galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "for this reason we have started a series of studies on the different aspects of star formation in m51 , based on @xmath0 observations in six broadband filters .",
    "the nucleus was studied by scuderi et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter called paper i ) , who found that it contains a total stellar mass of about @xmath23  within the central 17 pc and a bright point source of @xmath24  within the inner 2 pc . in this paper",
    "we study the properties of the elongated  yellow / reddish \" region around the nucleus , hereafter called `` the bulge '' , and of 30 bright point - like sources that we discovered in it .",
    "these point sources indicate ongoing star formation in the bulge region , which is otherwise dominated by old ( @xmath25 5 gyrs ) stars ( paper i ) .",
    "the full @xmath0 image of m51 is published is paper i. the image shows that the nucleus is surrounded by an elongated bulge of about 460 @xmath26 860 pc that is dominated by an old stellar population .",
    "the spiral arms containing hii regions start outside the bulge .",
    "we adopt a distance of @xmath27 kpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath28 , which is based on the brightness distribution of planetary nebulae ( feldmeier , ciardullo & jacoby 1997 ) . at this distance , 1",
    "arcsec corresponds to a linear distance of 40.7 pc , one @xmath29 pixel of 0.046@xmath30 corresponds to 1.87 pc and an @xmath31 pixel of 0.1@xmath30 corresponds to 4.1 pc .    in   2 we describe the observations and the data reduction . in   3",
    "we discuss the interstellar extinction in the bulge . in   4 we describe the properties of 30 bright point - like sources in this region . in   5 their energy distributions are compared with those predicted for clusters with different ages and mass , and for single stars of different effective temperatures and radii .",
    "we will show that most of them are very luminous young stars ( single or multiple ) , rather than clusters .",
    "the star formation rate in the bulge of m51 is derived in   6 . in   7",
    "we compare the formation of massive stars in the bulge of m51 with clusters near the galactic center , in the interaction region of the antennae galaxies , and in the bulges of other spiral galaxies .",
    "we also discuss the predicted mode of star formation under the conditions that prevail near the nucleus of m51 .",
    "the conclusions are given in ",
    "m51 was observed with @xmath0 on may 12 , 1994 and on january 15 , 1995 as part of the @xmath32 supernova intensive study ( sins ) program to study sn 1994i ( millard  1999 ) .",
    "the galaxy was observed through the wide band filters f255w and f336w in 1994 and through the wide band filters f439w , f555w , f675w and f814w in 1995 .",
    "we will refer to these filters as the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 filters .",
    "the observations in the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 filters were split into four , three and two exposures of 500 , 400 , 700 @xmath39 respectively , while a single exposure of 600 @xmath39 was taken with the remaining filters .",
    "the data were processed through the podps ( post observation data processing system ) pipeline for bias removal and flat fielding .",
    "the removal of the cosmic rays in the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 images was accomplished by combining the available exposures . for the images taken in the other three filters we used a simple procedure , which consists in combining images obtained in adjacent bands , that allowed us to remove most of the contribution from the cosmic rays ( see paper 1 ) . unfortunately the corrected images still showed some residual contamination from cosmic rays which could have affected the photometry . to obtain a list of the point - like sources in each filter we used an unsharp masking method .",
    "this was done because of the complexity of the background emission .",
    "in fact , it seems that most of the point - like sources lie on or close to dust lanes that are the inner extensions of the spiral arms structures .",
    "the method consisted in smoothing each image using a gaussian with 4 pixels fwhm and then subtracting the smoothed image from the original image . from each image",
    "the list of sources was obtained by picking up all the objects above a threshold , variable from about 3 to 13 times the local value of the background depending on the filter .",
    "these lists contained also residual cosmic rays so we  cross  correlated \" them , selecting only those objects that were present in at least two different filters .",
    "this procedure was applied only to the optical filters .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 images were taken 8 months earlier than the optical images , which means that the orientation of the spacecraft was not the same in the two epochs . in the 1995 observations",
    "the nucleus of m51 was near the center of the pc - images , but in 1994 the images were centered on sn  1994i and the nucleus was at the edge of the pc - image .",
    "this means that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 observations of about half of the point sources were made with the pc - camera and the rest were made with the wf - camera .    to obtain the photometry of the point - like sources in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 filters we first took the list containing the positions ( pixel coordinates ) of the point - like sources in the optical images and rotated the image , taking the position of sn 1994i as origin , to match the different orientation . in this way we identified the same point - like sources in the @xmath33 images as in the optical images .",
    "we performed aperture photometry using an aperture radius of 2 pixels and calculating the sky background in an annulus with internal and external radius of 5 and 8 pixels respectively .",
    "the correction for the aperture was obtained from a theoretical psf obtained with tiny tim ( krist & burrows 1994 ) .",
    "the flux calibration was obtained using the internal calibration of the @xmath40 , using the spectrum of vega as photometric zero - point ( whitmore 1995 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the photometry was computed by taking into account photon noise , background noise and ccd read - out noise only .",
    "charge transfer and distortion effects were not taken into account .",
    "tests showed that these effects have little influence on the colours ( less than about 0.03 magn ) and on the magnitudes ( less than 0.04 magn ) .",

    "the bulge region is indicated .",
    "figure [ fig : bulge ] shows the region of the bulge enlarged .",
    "the symbols and the marked areas are described below .",
    "the region around the nucleus of m51 , in an area of about 11 @xmath26 16 arcsec = 460 @xmath26 680 pc , appears  yellow / reddish \" in the @xmath32 images .",
    "the light from this region , the bulge , is dominated by an old stellar population .",
    "the brightness distribution in the bulge is smooth and homogeneous in color apart from the many darker  lanes \" which are obviously due to dust extinction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bulge ] . assuming a homogeneous stellar distribution in color and magnitudes , the extinction can be studied by comparing the magnitudes and colors of the dusty regions with those in adjacent regions",
    "were the extinction appears to be small .    to this purpose",
    "we have selected in the bulge four areas with different extinctions ( fields a to d ) .",
    "the locations of these fields are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulge ] . for each of the fields we constructed @xmath41 versus @xmath36 and color - color plots of all the pixels .",
    "figure [ fig : absebv ] shows the @xmath41 versus @xmath36 plots for fields a and c. assuming that the background population of bulge stars has a uniform colour ( see paper i ) , the slopes of the relations give the extinction ratios .",
    "the range of the magnitudes in each field provide an estimate of the maximum extinction values .",
    "we find that the extinction in the bulge is small and has a maximim value of about 0.25 in @xmath42 , in agreement with paper i.    the resulting values of the extinction ratios are listed in table [ tbl : extinction ] where the values are also compared with the galactic values for the same @xmath32 filters based on the extinction curve of savage and mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the galactic values were derived by applying the extinction curve to the stellar energy distribution of an unreddened a0-star and then convolving the resulting spectrum with the @xmath32 filter characteristics ( for details , see romaniello 1998 , and romaniello  2001 ) .",
    "the table shows that the extinction ratios are quite similar to those of our galaxy , which suggests that the extinction curve of the two galaxies are about the same .",
    "scuderi  ( 2001 ) have reached the same conclusion for the m51 nuclear region , but using a somewhat different method .",
    "hill et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown on the basis of a study of hii regions observed with the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ that the far - uv extinction of m51 is smaller than in the galaxy , @xmath43 for m51 compared to 8.33 for the galaxy .",
    "this is not in contradiction with our results , because the far - uv extinction at @xmath44 is known to vary drastically both in the galaxy and in the lmc between different regions .",
    "[ fig : absebv ]    .reddening in the galaxy and in the bulge of m51 [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath45 : @xmath46 is the initial mass of the clusters .",
    "+ @xmath47 : frascati cluster model was adopted .",
    "[ tbl : bulgestars ]",
    "the bulge point sources have visual magnitudes between 21.4 and 24.4 corresponding to @xmath48 if there were no extinction . for a mean reddening of @xmath49 ( see below ) the absolute magnitudes are about @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the bulge point sources could be either small clusters or very bright stars .",
    "we will consider both possibilities .",
    "if the blue point sources are clusters , they can not be very massive .",
    "for instance a cluster with an initial mass of @xmath51   and an age of @xmath52 years will have a visual absolute magnitude of @xmath53 ( leitherer & heckman , 1995 ) . at the distance of m51 and with an extinction of @xmath54",
    "the cluster will have @xmath55 .",
    "the observed point sources are 7 to 9 magnitudes fainter , so their initial mass must have been a few @xmath56 to a few @xmath57 . for clusters of such a small mass , the colors and magnitudes can not be accurately predicted because they will depend on the evolutionary stage of one or few of the most luminous and most massive stars .",
    "therefore , the results of fitting the observed energy distributions to models should only be considered as a rough estimate of the cluster parameters .",
    "we have fitted the observed energy distributions of the bulge point sources with those predicted for instantaneously formed clusters , from leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) , henceforth called `` lh - models '' and from the frascati - group ( see below ) , henceforth called the `` frascati - models '' .",
    "we adopted the lh - models of clusters with solar metallicity , with an imf of @xmath58 ( salpeter s value ) and with an upper mass cut - off of 100  and a lower mass cut - off of 1 .",
    "these models cover an age range from 0.2 to 300 myrs .",
    "the predicted magnitude in the @xmath59 band was derived from their magnitude at 2100   and the slope of the spectral energy distribution between 2100 and 3000  .",
    "frascati - models  were calculated by romaniello ( 1997 ) from the evolutionary tracks of brocato & castellani ( 1993 ) and cassisi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) using the wfpc2 magnitudes derived from the stellar atmosphere models by kurucz ( 1993 ) .",
    "these models are for instantaneous formation of a cluster of solar metallicity stars in the mass range of 0.6 to 25 , distributed according to salpeter s imf .",
    "these models cover an age range of 10 to 5000 myr .",
    "the lh - models are expected to more accurate for the younger clusters , because they are based on the evolutionary tracks of the geneva - group which include massive stars .",
    "the frascati models are expected to be more accurate for the old clusters , because they include stars with masses down to 0.6 . for both sets of cluster - models",
    "the magnitudes were calculated directly from the predicted energy distributions , using the @xmath40 filter calibration ( whitmore 1995 ) .",
    "these magnitudes will be compared directly with the observed magnitudes , so we do not have to apply the `` holtzman et al . '' ( 1995 ) colour correction , which is needed when the magnitudes of the models are given in the standard filters .    for fitting the predicted to the observed energy distributions we used a three dimensional maximum likelyhood method .",
    "the free parameters are @xmath42 , the initial mass , @xmath46 , and age , @xmath60 .",
    "we corrected the observed magnitudes for extinction in the range of @xmath61 in steps of 0.02 .",
    "the extinction values listed in table [ tbl : extinction ] were adopted .",
    "the weighting factors are chosen as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the uncertainty in the magnitude . for sources that were not detected in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 images we adopted brightness upper limits of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as discussed above .",
    "the uncertainty in the fitting of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 magnitudes to the models depends more strongly on the accuracy of the adopted extinction curve than on the accuracy of the observed magnitudes .",
    "this uncertainty of the short wavelength fitting will be larger for objects with large values of @xmath42 . to take this into account",
    "we have added an extra term in the uncertainty of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the model fitting of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 magnitudes , with a minimum uncertainty of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that the fitting had be done in two steps : first with the normal values of @xmath63 to find the best fit of the cluster parameters and @xmath42 and then with the extra uncertainty in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 magnitudes .",
    "the values of @xmath42 of the second iteration turn out to be very similar to those of the first iteration .",
    "the resulting fits of the lh - models and the frascati - models were compared and one of the two was adopted , based on the following criteria : ( a ) significantly smaller reduced @xmath70 ; ( b ) significantly smaller value of @xmath42 .",
    "this last criterium is used because all reliable fits ( small @xmath70 ) have a small extinction and because the study of the extinction ( see  3 ) showed that @xmath42 is very small in the bulge .",
    "so if the energy distribution can be fitted with a young cluster of high extinction or an older cluster of low extinction , we adopted the second solution .",
    "the uncertainties in the ages and initial masses are derived from the requirement that only fits with @xmath71 are acceptable .",
    "this corresponds to the 68 % confidence range .",
    "the results are listed in the left half of table [ tbl : bulgestars ] and the fits are shown in figure [ fig : fits]a .",
    "for most sources a fit with a reasonably small value of @xmath72 is found , however 7 sources have a high value of @xmath73 .",
    "the cluster parameters of these models are not reliable .",
    "the results in table [ tbl : bulgestars ] confirm our previous estimate that the young clusters have a low mass .",
    "more than half of the clusters have an initial mass smaller than about 1000 .",
    "only old clusters with @xmath74 myrs have @xmath75 .",
    "this is due to the detection limit .",
    "a cluster with an initial mass is below @xmath76  fades below the detection limit at an age of about 300 myrs ( leitherer & heckmann , 1995 ) .",
    "we have also fitted the energy distributions of the bulge point sources to those predicted by model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1993 ) . for this purpose",
    "we selected 15 models with temperatures ranging from 3750 k to 50000 k and the lowest gravities in the grid of model atmospheres .",
    "we realize that the kurucz blanketed lte - model atmospheres may not be very accurate for the hottest stars where non - lte effects and atmospheric extension effects may play a role .",
    "so these models are not expected to give accurate values of the stellar parameters based on @xmath40-photometry .",
    "however , they serve the present purpose of obtaining an indication of the effective temperature and luminosity of the bulge point sources .",
    "the models were fitted to the observations using a three dimensional maximum likelyhood method .",
    "the free parameters are @xmath42 , @xmath77 and radius .",
    "to fit the observed energy distributions to those of model atmospheres , we corrected the observed magnitudes for extinction in the range of @xmath61 in steps of 0.02 ( similar to the fit of the cluster models ) .",
    "the resulting dereddened energy distributions were compared to those of the model atmospheres and the best - fit model was determined .",
    "the two fit parameters for the shape of the energy distributions are @xmath42 , .",
    "the fit parameter for the absolute magnitude is the angular diameter or radius of the star .",
    "the weights of the fitting are the same as described in the previous section . to take into account the uncertainty in the extinction at the wavelengths of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 filter",
    ", we have added an extra uncertainty @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as described in the previous section .",
    "the results are listed in the right hand side of table [ tbl : bulgestars ] .",
    "we list the values of @xmath42 ,  and log @xmath80 and the value of the reduced @xmath70 of the fit .",
    "the range of acceptable parameters was determined in the same way as for clusters , i.e. the acceptable models have @xmath81 .",
    "notice that for almost all sources which are observed in six wavelength bands , the fits of the energy distributions to stellar models are significantly better ( smaller @xmath70 ) than fits to the cluster models .",
    "in total 23 objects have @xmath82 and only 3 have @xmath83 .",
    "the values of @xmath42 derived from the fits are in the range of 0.0 to 1.3 , with more than half of the objects having @xmath84 .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived values of @xmath42 affects the uncertainty in  and log @xmath85 .",
    "a higher value of @xmath42 corresponds to a higher value of , a higher value of   ( because the bolometric correction increases with ) and a smaller radius of the object .",
    "we list the uncertainty in log  and log @xmath86 , but not in @xmath42 . the uncertainty in log @xmath87",
    "is related to the uncertainty in log  by @xmath88 for the hottest stars with @xmath89 k and @xmath90 for the stars with @xmath91 k. for stars in the range of @xmath92 k , the bc is very small and almost independent of . for the coolest point source in our sample ,",

    "typical uncertainties are @xmath93 , @xmath94 log @xmath95 0.1 and @xmath94 log @xmath95 0.4 for hot stars observed in all six bands , and @xmath96 , @xmath94 log @xmath95 0.2 and @xmath94 log @xmath95 0.6 for the cooler stars observed in the visual colors only . for stars with @xmath89 k",
    "the uncertainty is larger ( possibly as large as 10  000 k at @xmath97 ) due to the uncertainties in the adopted kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres .",
    "figure [ fig : fits]b shows the comparison between the observed magnitudes and the predicted magnitudes of the best fit model for each point source as a function of wavelength .",
    "the observed lower limits are also indicated .",
    "notice that the agreement is satisfactory for almost all models .",
    "we discuss some typical energy distributions .",
    "+  source 3 is the reddest object in our sample .",
    "it fits the energy distribution of a cool star of = 4500 k with a large extinction of @xmath98 .",
    "+  sources 12 , 26 and 27 are the three objects with the brightest relative @xmath33 magnitude in our sample .",
    "they have an energy distribution of a hot star of = 50  000 k ( nr 12 ) or 23  000 k ( nrs 26 and 27 ) without extinction .",
    "+  source 20 is a cold star of = 6000 k without extinction .",
    "the sharp decrease in flux to shorter wavelength agrees with the observed upper limit of the flux in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 band .",
    "+  if source 21 is a hot but heavily extincted star , as suggested by the fit , its luminosity is so high that it must be a cluster .",
    "the cluster fitting showed that it could be an old cluster .",
    "surprisingly , however , the fwhm of this source shows that it is a point source .",
    "maybe it is a very cool star .",
    "+ from studies of galactic early type stars it is known that about half of the luminous stars are in binary systems with a mass ratio close to unity ( garmany  1980 ) .",
    "so we can expect that a significant fraction of the bulge point sources are in fact binaries . since the post - mainsequence lifetime is much shorter than the main sequence lifetime it is most likely that the systems are observed either when both stars are on the main sequence , or when one of the two stars has already finished its life .",
    "so with a few exceptions ( less than about 10 % ) , we can expect that the energy distribution of a binary system will be close to that of a single star with a luminosity of at most twice as high as that a single star .",
    "figure [ fig : bulgehrd ] shows the resulting hr diagram of the bulge point sources .",
    "one object , nr 21 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , is outside the range of the figure .",
    "an uncertainty in @xmath42 and correspondingly in  and log   for a fixed value of @xmath36 results in tilted error bars , because a higher @xmath42 implies a higher temperature and a larger bolometric correction .",
    "we show only the typical error bars as the individual values can be derived from table [ tbl : bulgestars ] .",
    "the figure also shows part of the evolutionary tracks of massive stars for galactic metallicities from meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for enhanced mass loss rates .",
    "we see that _ if _ the point sources are indeed single stars , their initial masses are in the range of about 12 to 150 .",
    "the four brightest objects might even have masses of about 200 , if they are single stars .",
    "this is about the same mass as the famous `` pistol star '' near the galactic center ( figer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the empirical luminosity upper limit for stars , i.e. the humpreys - davidson limit , hd - linit , ( humphreys & davidson 1979 ; fitzpatrick & garmany 1990 ) , is shown in figure [ fig : bulgehrd ] .",
    "almost all the bright point sources have luminosities very close to or below the hd - limit .",
    "it suggests that at least a majority of the bulge point sources could be massive stars .",
    "the group of hot stars with @xmath101 and @xmath102 have initial masses between about 40 and 150  and ages on the order of 4 to @xmath103 years or less .",
    "the group of cool stars with @xmath104 and @xmath105 have initial masses between 15 and 25  and ages between 7 to 17 @xmath106 years ( meynet et al .",
    "we note that the radius ( or luminosity ) of the star was a free parameter in the fitting of the models to the observations , so the luminosity was not restraint by the input models .    the two hot objects high above the hd - limit in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgehrd ] are : +  nr 1 with @xmath107 , and @xmath108 and +  nr 14 with @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . + nr 1 is definitely a point source .",
    "nr 14 is in a region of high background radiation , so its fwhm could not be determined .",
    "these sources might be either superluminous stars or small clusters .",
    "source 21 is also a cluster , based on its brightness .",
    "we note that due to the uncertainties in the kurucz model atmospheres of high temperature , the hottest objects may have a substantial uncertainty in the determination of @xmath77 and @xmath86 .",
    "the lower limit of the luminosity of the point sources in the hr diagram is due to a combination of three effects : ( a ) the detection limit , ( b ) the extinction and ( c ) the bolometric correction as a function of intrinsic color .",
    "we can predict the location of the lower limit in this diagram if we adopt a magnitude limit of @xmath111 , no extinction and the bc versus  relation from the kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres for galactic metallicity .",
    "the resulting lower limit is shown in figure [ fig : bulgehrd ] .",
    "it agrees very well with the observations .",
    "stars ( or clusters ) fainter that this detection limit might be present in the bulge of m51 , but would not have been detected .",
    "a striking feature of the distribution of the stars in the hrd is the gap in temperature between @xmath112 and 4.3 , apart from the errorbars of the sources just outside the gap .",
    "the mean value of @xmath113 is @xmath114 for the hot group of @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the cold group of @xmath117 , so the two groups do not overlap .",
    "such a gap in the -distribution is expected if the point sources are stars , because massive stars cross this temperature interval in a short time after their main sequence phase .",
    "the gap is not expected if the sources were clusters .",
    "we found above that the energy distributions of the majority of the sources can best be fitted to that of individual massive stars , rather than clusters .",
    "moreover , the vast majority of the objects are point sources ( see  4 ) .",
    "this shows that the energy distributions of the objects is dominated by one ( or very few ) massive star(s ) . in this section",
    "we will try to answer the question : `` how many low mass stars could be hiding near the luminous stars before we would notice their presence in the spectral energy distribution ? '' .",
    "we will describe two tests .",
    "let us consider the case that an observed point source is in fact a cluster with a certain imf .",
    "suppose that the cluster contains one massive star ( the observed one ) , with the derived mass @xmath118 and luminosity @xmath87 , plus a tail of lower mass stars on the main sequence , distributed in mass according to an imf @xmath119 with @xmath120 ( salpeter s value ) .",
    "in these calculations we adopt a conservative lower mass limit of @xmath121 .",
    "the constant c is determined from the condition that the most massive star is formed at the median of its probability interval , so that    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is the mass upper limit for star formation , which we assume to be about 200 .",
    "this will then also determine the mass of the next massive star , as the solution of the same integral but with @xmath118 replaced by @xmath124 and 0.5 by 1.5 , etc .",
    "if we also assume a mass  luminosity relation @xmath125 with @xmath126 , we can calculate the total luminosity and the total mass of the cluster .",
    "we found that in a cluster with a most massive star of @xmath127  the stars with masses @xmath128 contribute only about 1 percent to the luminosity when their total mass is @xmath129 .",
    "for a cluster with a most massive star of 120   a total mass of 1100  in lower mass stars is needed to increase the luminosity by 1 percent .",
    "this contribution from lower mass stars scales linearly with the mass of the cluster .",
    "the mean colors of the total radiation from cluster stars of @xmath130 are similar to those of an a type star , i.e. @xmath131 .    the next question is : can we notice the presence of such a cluster in the energy distribution ? to answer this question we have to look at the long wavelength part of the spectrum , where the contribution by the cool stars may dominate that of the brightest hot star .",
    "the most stringent test is provided by the bluest point sources .",
    "the bluest source without extinction is nr 12 , which has @xmath132 k , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and a bolometric correction of 4.27 .",
    "the visual magnitude has an uncertainty of 0.14 ( 1 @xmath135 ) .",
    "if there is a cluster , it should increase the brightness in the @xmath36-band by less than @xmath136 .",
    "suppose the brightest star ( i.e. the observed hot star ) has a luminosity of @xmath87 and the contribution of the cluster to the luminosity is @xmath137 .",
    "it is easy to show that the visual brightness will increase by a factor    @xmath138    where the two bolometric corrections are those of the brightest star and of the rest of the cluster .",
    "the factor @xmath139 is thus related to the brightness increase in the @xmath36-band by    @xmath140    with @xmath141 . applying the equation to star nr 12 we find @xmath142 . using the calculations described above we find an upper limit to the cluster mass of 840 . using the same method to stars nrs 29 , 6 , 27 and 26 , with  = 50 000 , 30 000 , 23 000 and 23 000 respectively",
    ", we find upper limits to the mass of the clusters of 1200 , 500 , 420 and 240 .",
    "these values are of about the same order as derived from the cluster fits in   5.1 .",
    "so stars nrs 26 and 27 with @xmath143 provide the most stringent upper limits to the mass of the clusters , of only a few hundred . a similar test for the @xmath37-band magnitudes",
    "gives almost identical results .      in the second test",
    "we have assumed that the luminous star is surrounded by a cluster consisting of stars with masses between 10 and 1 , distributed according to an imf with a slope of 2.35 .",
    "we assumed that the stars are on the zero age main sequence , and we adopted the @xmath32-band fluxes calculated by romaniello ( 1999 ) for the kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres to calculate the @xmath32-magnitudes of such a cluster . for a total cluster mass of 1000 , at a distance of 8.4 mpc we find the following magnitudes ( in the vega system ) : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we then fitted the observed energy distributions of those 14 point sources that were observed in all 6 wavelength bands , with a model energy distribution that had the following properties : it consists of a star with either = 40  000 or 25  000 k ( depending on the value of  that we found by assuming it to be a single star , see table [ tbl : bulgestars ] ) , with a luminosity of @xmath87 plus a cluster with a total mass of @xmath152",
    ". the free parameters of the fitting procedure are : @xmath87 , @xmath152 and @xmath42 .",
    "the fitting was done in exactly the same way as described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 .    for 9 out of the 14 point sources we find that the cluster masses of the best fitting energy distribution is less than 400 .",
    "the energy distributions of sources 6 , 12 , 14 , 15 and 29 are best fitted without clusters ( @xmath153 ) . for 6 out of the 14 sources ( nrs 6 , 10 , 15 , 24 , 26 and 27 )",
    "even the _ maximum _ cluster mass that is compatible with the observed energy distribution is less than 400 .",
    "so we conclude that for the majority of the bulge point sources the energy distribution is dominated by only one ( or very few ) massive star(s ) , and that for the hottest sources the upperlimit to the mass of a possible accompanying cluster is surprisingly small .",
    "we compare the energy distribution of the hottest and bluest sources of m51 with that expected for the very young orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , if that was at a distance of m51 .    in optical and uv images , the onc cluster with an age of about @xmath154",
    "yrs , appears like a group of four bright hot stars with a distribution tail of much fainter and cooler pre - main sequence stars . at the distance of m51 such a group of a few luminous hot stars",
    "might ressemble the bulge point sources . in reality",
    "however , the trapezium stars are members of a larger star forming cluster with a diameter of about 5 pc , with about 1600 optical stars and a total mass in excess of @xmath57  ( hillenbrand , 1997 ) . the main sequence is populated down to @xmath155 , corresponding to type a5 and a mass of 2 .",
    "the lower mass stars are still in their pre - main sequence phase .",
    "a large fraction of the stars are reddened by an extinction of @xmath156 to 8.5 magnitudes .",
    "this is much higher than the extinction of the m51 bulge point sources .",
    "so the total energy distribution of the onc stars does not resemble that of the uv - brightest bulge point sources .    at an age of a few myrs , when most of the dust around the onc stars will be dispersed and",
    "the lower mass stars have reached the main sequence , the orion nebula cluster would look like a `` normal '' cluster with a well populated main sequence , weighted towards the low mass end .",
    "we compare the energy distribution of the unreddened onc with that of the hottest bulge point sources .",
    "hillenbrand ( 1997 ) has determined the stellar parameters of 940 stars of the 1600 onc stars .",
    "she has shown that this is a representative sample of the stars in that cluster .",
    "the total mass of these 940 stars is 640 : about 90  for the four hot trapezium stars and 550  for the lower mass stars .",
    "these lower mass stars are under - represented by a factor two .",
    "we have used the parameters of these 940 stars , together with the energy distributions of the stellar atmospheres ( kurucz , 1993 ) to calculate the energy distribution of the cluster if it was located in m51 .",
    "the @xmath36-magnitude of this cluster , in the hst - vega system used throughout this paper , would be @xmath157 if the stars had no reddening at all .",
    "the four hottest stars contribute 84 , 70 and 58 percent to the flux in the @xmath33 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 band repectively .",
    "a comparison of the resulting unreddened onc energy distribution with those of the hottest m51 point sources shows that the spectra of the bluest sources nrs 6 , 24 , 26 , 27 and 29 are compatible ( within the uncertainty of the observations ) with that of the onc .",
    "the visual magnitudes of these point sources are about the same as expected for the unreddened onc .",
    "so these blue point sources look like the ureddened onc if the low mass stars are underrepresented by a factor 2 . if we correct the predicted onc energy distribution for the factor two undersampling of the low mass stars , we find that the predicted @xmath37 and @xmath38 magnitudes are too bright compared to the observed energy distribution of the hottest bulge point sources .",
    "source 12 is `` bluer '' than the unredenned onc , even with the undersampling of the low mass stars .",
    "we conclude from these tests that the m51 bulge point sources _ could _ be hiding small clusters .",
    "however for the bluest sources these clusters must have a total mass of less than about 400 @xmath158 whereas the star that dominates the energy distribution is already more massive than about 40  or even 120  ( nr 12 )",
    ".      we have found that the energy distributions of the bulge point sources can be fitted with those predicted for young massive stars or for young clusters of low total mass . +  if they are single stars , the initial mass of the hot luminous ones with @xmath159 and @xmath160 must be larger than about 40 , and their age must be lower than 4 myrs .",
    "the group of stars at @xmath161 and @xmath162 had initial masses between 12 and 25  and an age of 7 to 17 myrs .",
    "+  if the bulge point sources are clusters , half of the clusters have ages larger than 10 myr .",
    "the other half of the clusters is very young ( @xmath8 4 myr ) with small initial masses between 250 and 2000 .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of these young clusters show that even the clusters with the lowest masses must contain at least one massive hot star .",
    "there are four reasons suggesting that the point sources are massive stars or very small groups of a few massive stars , or poor clusters whose energy distributions are dominated by one or two massive stars .    1 .",
    "the single star models fit the energy distributions systematically better than the cluster models .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the values of @xmath163 of the stellar fit and the cluster fit in table [ tbl : bulgestars ] and from figure [ fig : fits ] .",
    "basically , the observed fluxes of the point sources better fit the `` narrow '' energy distributions of single stars than the `` wider '' distributions predicted for clusters that contain a range of stars of different masses and temperatures .",
    "half of the objects are very hot and should contain at least one or several massive o - stars in the range of 40 to 120  to explain the uv magnitudes .",
    "the tests described above show that _ if _ the point sources are clusters , the cluster mass in the form of lower mass stars is less than about 400  for the six @xmath33 brightest objects .",
    "the point sources follow the humpreys - davidson luminosity upper limit in the hr diagram , with a few exceptions .",
    "this is to be expected in case the point sources are stars , but there is no reason why clusters would follow this stellar upper limit in the hr diagram .",
    "4 .   the location of the sources in the hr diagram shows a division of the temperature distribution into two separate groups : one with @xmath164 and one with @xmath161 .",
    "this is to be expected if the point sources are stars , because the temperature range between the main sequence and the red supergiants in the hr diagram is crossed rapidly by stellar evolution , but not if the point sources were clusters .",
    "we realize that the number of sources is small and that we can not fully exclude the possibility that arguments 3 and 4 are the result of a chance coincidence .",
    "however the combination of the four arguments strongly suggests that most of the bulge point sources are massive stars or small groups of a few massive stars or poor clusters whose energy distribution is strongly dominated by one or two massive stars .",
    "these are statistical arguments , based on the whole sample of the bulge point sources .",
    "it is certainly possible that some of the point sources are in fact clusters , instead of single or very small groups of stars .",
    "this is probably the case for the few most luminous hot objects with @xmath165  and certainly for object 21 with @xmath166 .",
    "if the point sources are single stars or small groups of stars , their age is very small and on the order of a few @xmath51 years .",
    "source nr 13 with @xmath167 years is the only exception .",
    "( even if they are clusters , at least half of them are very young with ages leass than @xmath168 yrs . )",
    "this clearly indicates the presence of ongoing formation of massive stars in the bulge .",
    "this is most likely related to the morphological structure of the bulge .",
    "the old background population of the bulge shows a smooth distribution of stars older than 5 gyrs ( paper i ) .",
    "however the dust distribution shows evidence for spiral - like dust lanes .",
    "figure [ fig : pcimage ] shows that these dust lanes in the bulge follow the same pattern and are the inner extensions of the dust lanes observed outside the bulge .",
    "one of the major dust lanes in the bulge can be traced down into the north side of the nucleus and the other one can be seen to enter the nucleus on the south side .",
    "the bulge point sources also show evidence of occurring in strings with a morphology similar to that of the dust lanes .",
    "this shows that star formation is still going on in and near the spiral - like dust lanes in the bulge of m51 .",
    "the star formation rate in the bulge can be estimated only in a rough way .",
    "for this we consider the group in the hr diagram of hot stars with @xmath169 and the group of cooler stars with @xmath170 separately .",
    "the group of point sources with @xmath160 contains stars of initial mass in excess of 40 .",
    "their main sequence lifetime is about @xmath168 years , depending only weakly on luminosity . with an age of @xmath168 years and a total mass of about 1400  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgehrd ] ) , the formation rate of these most massive stars in the bulge is @xmath171 .",
    "we can also estimate the star formation rate from the 13 fainter point sources of @xmath170 , corresponding to stars in the initial mass range of 12 to 20 . in this mass range",
    "we do not see the stars in the main sequence phase because they will be too faint ( see the lower limit in figure [ fig : bulgehrd ] ) , but instead we see them in the red supergiant phase .",
    "the red supergiant phase of stars in the range 12 to 20  lasts about @xmath172 years ( 1.6 myrs for 12   and 0.7 myrs for 20 ) .",
    "the observed sources have a total initial mass of about 200 . with this mass and an age range of @xmath172 years",
    "we estimate the star formation rate of these lower mass stars to be about @xmath173 , i.e. of the same order of magnitude as found for the most massive stars .",
    "taking both groups together , we find that in the mass range of about 12 to 120  the minimum star formation rate in the bulge is about @xmath174 .",
    "( in this estimate we did not include the mass of source 21 , which is most likely an old cluster ) .",
    "this estimate provides obviously only a lower limit because we have assumed that only the most massive stars with @xmath175 are formed . in reality stars",
    "may be formed over a whole mass range down to some lower mass limit .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by assuming a continuous star formation with a given slope of the imf : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the number of stars per unit logarithmic mass interval .",
    "if we adopt @xmath178 ( salpeter s value ) with a lower limit of 1 , we find a star formation rate of @xmath179 .",
    "if we adopt a flatter imf of @xmath180 we find a rate of @xmath181 .",
    "we can derive a maximum star formation rate by assuming that all the bulge point sources are clusters , and using the cluster masses and ages listed in table [ tbl : bulgestars ] . taking the masses of the clusters formed in the last 10 myrs , we find a total mass of @xmath182  and a formation rate of @xmath183 .",
    "this is very similar to the rate derived under the assumption that all the point sources are young stars .",
    "this similarity is due to the very small masses of the clusters , compared to the high mass of the stars , plus the correction for the presence of lower mass stars .",
    "in paper i we found that the bulge has a total dust mass of @xmath184 .",
    "the gas content of the bulge in the form of neutral h has been derived from the 21 cm observations by tilanus & allen ( 1991 ) .",
    "they find that the column density of neutral h in the bulge is much smaller than outside the bulge . in the inner 1 arcminute ,",
    "i.e. within 240 pc from the nucleus , they measured a column density of @xmath185 h atoms  @xmath186 , with a maximum of @xmath187 ( allen , private communications ) .",
    "this implies a total hi mass of @xmath188  and a gas - to - dust ratio of about 170 , which is very close to the mean value of @xmath189 in the inner parts of our galaxy ( cox 2000 , p 160 ) .",
    "the estimate of the gas content excludes the contribution of the regions of high co density within 4 arcsec = 160 pc from the nucleus found by scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which have a total mass of about @xmath190 . )",
    "adopting a total ( gas + dust ) content of @xmath191  and a star formation rate of 1 to 2 @xmath192 , we find that the bulge could sustain this star formation rate during about only 2 to @xmath16 years .",
    "interestingly , this is also the age of the starburst in the nucleus of m51 and the approximately the time of closest approach of the companion ( paper i ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the massive star formation in the bulge that we see now is fed by material that was brought into the bulge by the interaction of the two galaxies .",
    "the most surprising result of this study is the presence of bright point sources , in the bulge of m51 that is otherwise dominated by an old background stellar population and spiral - like dust bands of moderate optical depth ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "the energy distribution of the point sources shows that they are most likely isolated ( or very small groups of ) massive stars , or very small clusters which are completely dominated by one or few massive stars . the distribution of the point sources in the bulge of m51 in `` strings '' ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bulgenrs ] ) shows that they are not ejected from the starburst in the nucleus , but must have been formed in situ .",
    "this shows that massive stars do not necessarily form in clusters but that they can be formed as isolated stars or in very small groups .",
    "we compare this with several other regions of massive star formation , and with theoretical predictions .",

    "only if there was no extinction at all in the onc , would its energy distribution be similar to that of the point sources in m51 with temperatures of about @xmath195 k. however , the hotter m51 sources have a steeper energy distribution ( equivalent to a higher temperature ) than the onc without extinction .",
    "this shows that these m51 sources have fewer ( or no ) low mass stars than the onc .",
    "\\(2 ) brandl et al .",
    "( 1995 , 2001 ) have shown that mass segregation has occurred in the core of the young compact lmc cluster r136a during the first few myrs .",

    ". stars of @xmath196 are concentrated within a core radius of 0.1 pc , which is five times smaller than the core radius of the whole cluster .",
    "could our blue point sources be the cores of clusters ? if the cluster r136a was in m51 , we would not observe the mass segregation and the photometry of the point source would include ( almost ) all stars in that cluster .",
    "so the `` hot '' energy distribution of many of the sources is not due to mass segregation , unless the clusters in the bulge of m51 disperse on a very short timescale of a few myr .",

    "it is very well possible that these conditions are met in the bulge of m51 : +",

    "models calculated by one of us ( ms ) of the thermal and chemical structure of interstellar clouds that have 1 or 2 magnitudes of visual extinction under these conditions , show that co is largely destroyed and that the [ oi ] fine structure line at 63 @xmath19 m is the dominant coolant ( spaans , private communication ) .",
    "\\(b ) the destruction of co in clouds of small extinction and the increased photo - electric heating will result in relatively high cloud temperatures of 300 to 2000 k. this will lead to high a jeans mass for gravitational contraction and the mckee criterium of @xmath204 ( mckee , 1989 ) to sustain star formation is not likely to be satisfied for the bulk of the gas . since the low extinction causes any stellar source to induce disfavorable conditions for further star formation in its vicinity , isolated patches of forming stars are the natural state .",
    "this suggests that the formation of isolated massive stars in the bulge of m51 could be due to the luminous central source , the low dust content , and the resulting small extinction .",
    "( the star formation under the conditions of the bulge of m51 will be described in more detail in a forthcoming paper by spaans et al . )",

    "+ ( c ) there is a gap in the distribution of the sources in the hr diagram at intermediate temperatures between @xmath211 and 10  000 k. this is easily explained if the point sources are stars , because that temperature range is crossed rapidly by the evolution tracks of stars .",
    "there is no obvious reason why clusters would avoid this temperature or colour range .",
    "4 .   the distribution of stars in the hr diagram shows two groups : ( a ) the most massive group of initial mass @xmath212 is mainly blue and hot , because most of these stars will not evolve into red supergiants during their evolution .",

    "<S> we present a study of @xmath0 observations of the inner kpc of the interacting galaxy m51 in six bands from 2550   to 8140  . </S>",
    "<S> the images show an oval shaped area ( which we call  bulge \" ) of about @xmath1 arcsec or @xmath2 pc around the nucleus that is dominated by a smooth  yellow / reddish \" background population with overimposed dust lanes . </S>",
    "<S> these dust lanes are the inner extensions of the spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction properties , derived in four fields in and outside dust lanes , is similar to the galactic extinction law . </S>",
    "<S> the reddish stellar population has an intrinsic color of @xmath3 suggesting an age in excess of 5 gyrs .    </S>",
    "<S> we found 30 bright point - like sources in the bulge of of m51 i.e. within 110 to 350 pc from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the point sources have @xmath4 , many of which are blue with @xmath5 and are bright in the uv with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these objects appear to be located in elongated  strings \" which follow the general pattern of the dust lanes around the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distributions of the point - like sources are compared with those predicted for models of clusters or single stars . </S>",
    "<S> there are three reasons to conclude that most of these point sources are isolated massive stars ( or very small groups of a few isolated massive stars ) rather than clusters : + ( a ) the energy distributions of most objects are best fitted with models of single stars of @xmath7 between -6.1 and -9.1 , temperatures between 4000 and 50000 k , and with 4.2 @xmath8 log @xmath9 7.2 , and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> + ( b ) in the hr diagram the sources follow the humphreys - davidson luminosity upper limit for massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> + ( c ) the distribution of the sources in the hr diagram shows a gap in the range of @xmath11 k , which agrees with the rapid crossing of the hrd by stars , but not of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> + we have derived upper limits to the total mass of lower mass stars ( @xmath12 ) , that could be `` hiding '' within the point sources . </S>",
    "<S> for the `` bluest '' sources the upper limit is only a few hundred .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the formation of massive stars outside clusters ( or in very low mass clusters ) is occurring in the bulge of m51 .    </S>",
    "<S> the estimated star formation rate in the bulge of m51 is 1 to @xmath13 , depending on the adopted imf . with the observed total amount of gas in the bulge , @xmath14 , and the observed normal gas to dust ratio of @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , this star formation rate could be sustained for about 2 to @xmath16 years . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the ongoing massive star formation in the bulge of m51 is fed / triggered by the interaction with its companion about @xmath17 years ago . the star formation in the bulge of m51 ia compared with tat in bulges of other spirals .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions of star formation suggest that isolated massive stars might be formed in clouds in which h@xmath18 , [ oi ] 63 @xmath19 m and [ cii ] 158 @xmath19 m are the dominant coolants . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected to occur in regions of rather low optical depth , @xmath20 , with a hot source that can dissociate the co molecules . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are met in the bulge of m51 , where the extinction is low and where co can be destroyed by the radiation from the bright nuclear starburst cluster in the center . </S>",
    "<S> the mode of formation of massive stars in the bulge of m51 may resemble the star formation in the early universe , when the co and dust contents were low due to the low metallicity . </S>"
