    "the prediction of the spectrum of light hadron masses is one of the fundamental aims of lattice qcd .",
    "this has already been done extensively in the quenched approximation by several collaborations .",
    "the results for the quenched spectrum have been found to lie within 10% of the experimental values .",
    "this is encouraging and motivates a full calculation with dynamical quarks .",
    "the results of such a study would test the appropriateness of qcd as the theory of the strong interaction .    in this paper i present work on the light hadron spectrum for the ukqcd collaboration using a non - perturbatively o(a)-improved wilson action with two degenerate dynamical quarks .",
    "much of this work can be found in a recent paper on unquenching effects by the ukqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "the three dynamical simulations and one quenched simulation used to study unquenching were performed at values of @xmath2 and @xmath3(where appropriate ) falling on a trajectory of fixed lattice spacing .",
    "this was done to minimise variations due to residual discretisation errors and finite volume effects .",
    "in addition to these four simulations i include results from two dynamical simulations lying on a different fixed lattice spacing trajectory and one exploratory run at lighter quark mass to test the limits of the current algorithms .",
    "the fixed lattice spacing trajectories were determined using the matching techniques in @xcite and the scale set using @xmath1 in all simulations .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to the fits to single correlators , simultaneous fits were performed to ll , fl and ff correlators .",
    "not only did this allow fitting to a common mass but the amplitude factors , @xmath4 , for the three correlators could be written in terms of two common factors , further constraining the fit and reducing the total number of parameters .",
    "the hadron mass analysis proceeded in all cases by performing fits over a series of time ranges .",
    "as an example figure [ sliding ] shows the dependence of the fitted ground state mass for a vector meson on the minimum time of the fit range , @xmath5 .",
    "final fit ranges were chosen when the goodness of fit parameter , @xmath6 , indicated the ansatz was appropriate and when some stability in the fit parameters with respect to small changes in the fit range had been reached .",
    "the statistical errors on the fit parameters were calculated by the bootstrap method .",
    "the fit results for all but the @xmath7 and @xmath8 datasets can be found in @xcite .",
    "i present preliminary results for these two remaining datasets in table [ fit_results ]",
    ". fits to mesonic correlators were performed for all combinations of the valence quark masses , as given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "baryonic fits have only been performed with degenerate valence quarks .",
    "all of these results are from simultaneous fits to ll , fl and ff correlators .",
    "the results for the @xmath11 dataset and the mesonic fits for the @xmath12 dataset were produced with a ground state only fit ansatz ( i.e. @xmath13 in equation [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "the remaining baryonic fits were performed with the first excited state contribution included .",
    "i would like to thank the carnegie trust for the universities of scotland and the european community s human potential programme under hprn - ct-2000 - 00145 hadrons / latticeqcd for their financial support of this work .",
