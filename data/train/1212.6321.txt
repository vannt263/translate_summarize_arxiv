    "soap films and bubbles have , over the years , been a topic of active interest both in pedagogy and in research , in mathematics as well as in physics . in the eighteenth and nineteenth century , it was lagrange @xcite and plateau @xcite who pioneered the study of such",
    "_ minimal surfaces _ which eventually led to the well - known _ plateau problem _ in mathematics .",
    "plateau , in fact was also the first to perform a series of elegant experiments with soap films which served as a basis for future experimental and mathematical investigations .",
    "further details on the science of soap films and bubbles from a physicists viewpoint can be found in the well - known book of isenberg @xcite . on the mathematical front",
    ", the book by osserman @xcite , as its title suggests , provides a survey on minimal surfaces .",
    "our interest in this article is focused on one specific soap film configuration  the film formed between a pair of parallel , coaxial , equal radii rings ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . geometrically ,",
    "we know that the surface spanned by the film is a catenoid  a minimal ( zero mean curvature ) surface . following original work by plateau , an extensive analysis on this class of films was done in 1980 by durand @xcite .",
    "more recently , some theoretical and experimental work has been reported in @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is clear from the time evolution that the analytical and numerical conclusions on stability found and stated earlier are once again confirmed .",
    "we have shown using analytical and semi - analytical methods , that only the azimuthally symmetric(@xmath0 ) perturbation of the catenoidal soap film can be unstable and this is true when @xmath1 is greater than @xmath2 .",
    "physically this means that for any given small @xmath0 perturbation , the soap film can collapse in an azimuthally symmetric way into two disconnected plane discs . on the other hand for @xmath3 ,",
    "the film remains stable as long as the perturbation does not become too large .",
    "this rather counter - intuitive result was shown first , using numerics and experiment in @xcite .",
    "our results re - confirm the result in @xcite using different theoretical tools such as ( a ) a purely analytical method and ( b ) the semi - analytical aim .",
    "one can also analyze a more general situation , where the radius of the rings are not same , using the methods employed here .",
    "for such a case , we have to alter the transformations in eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) accordingly , by invoking appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "in addition to the above results , our work also provides an example of the use of aim and improved aim in tackling eigenvalue problems which are difficult to solve , analytically .",
    "sj acknowledges the department of physics , iit kharagpur , india for providing him the opportunity to work on this project .",
    "for a regular sturm - liouville problem defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsl ] ) , @xmath4 where , @xmath5 are eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath6 , both satisfying the boundary conditions , eq .",
    "( [ subeq : rsl2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ subeq : rsl3 ] ) . since @xmath7 on @xmath8 $ ] , using @xmath9,the complex conjugate of @xmath10 , in place of @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : greensid ] ) we get , @xmath12 if the boundary conditions are _ separated _ , which mean ,    [ eq : seprtedbc ] @xmath13 @xmath14    then , @xmath15 implies @xmath16 and @xmath17 implies @xmath18 .",
    "so , the first two terms on the right hand side of the inequality  ( [ eq : greensid1 ] ) are positive .",
    "thus , we have , @xmath19 for _ separated boundary conditions _ ,",
    "@xmath6 is _ self adjoint _",
    "operator and hence , @xmath10 and @xmath9 have a common real eigenvalue , say @xmath20 .",

    "consider the homogeneous , linear , second order differential equation @xmath23 according to the asymptotic iteration method , for sufficiently large value of @xmath24 ( @xmath24 is an integer ) , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "we also define a function @xmath29 such that @xmath30 the eigenvalues can be computed by means of @xmath31 .",
    "[ app : iaim ]    due to the presence of differentiation in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) and ( [ eq:15 ] ) , aim may slow down the computer and consequently less number of iterations can be performed .",
    "however , in some problems a large number of iterations are required for convergence of the result . improved asymptotic iteration method , introduced in @xcite ,",
    "can speed up the process quite a bit .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 can be expanded in series around @xmath34 , which is used in eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) to compute the eigenvalue .",

    "( [ eq : iaimeigen ] ) , which can be used for the computation of eigenvalues .",
