    "i remember it very clearly : it was a sunny spring northern california afternoon in 1988 .",
    "i had just passed my ph.d .",
    "exams and was about to start research . my ph.d .",
    "advisor took his other student ( also my collaborator ) and me out to lunch to the place across from the physics department .",
    "this was unusual , so it naturally weighed a lot .",
    "i do not remember his exact words , but he basically told us about the many difficulties that would lay ahead should we decide to follow research in lattice gauge theory .",
    "now , as if that was not enough , the next year , at the lattice conference at capri , the father of this all , k. wilson , resigned with a farewell - good - luck - i - am - out - of - here talk .",
    "i am not sure if i heard this directly from k. wilson or from anectodal rumors , but whatever might be the case , it was something like this : `` to be able to do qcd we will need lattice volumes @xmath0 , and by the time computers will reach this capability i will be too old ... and there are so many more interesting things in science to just wait for this ... '' now i see what the great man meant . having been involved in building supercomputers for the last 8 years it is my estimate that that volume will be reached around 2012 .",
    "now , these were dire warnings .",
    "needless to say , i did not listen and the price has been high .",
    "nevertheless , nearly 14 years later , i am writing this from a boston cafe while lattice 2002 is in progress .",
    "but it is all my advisor s fault ... he introduced me to the lattice fermion doubling problem ; and it was love at first sight ...    where else in theoretical physics can you find a problem that appears so painfully simple and yet runs so deep ?",
    "well , there are a few more but this is definitely one of them .    and , yes , an extra dimension came in naturally to cater to this problem .",
    "domain wall fermions ( dwf ) , a revolutionary technique , were introduced in @xcite ( for reviews and references see @xcite ) . and , the extra dimension did not come from string theory , nor from any other theory - beyond - the - standard - model , but from this silly little technical lattice problem .",
    "and i still feel that we have not yet grasped its full meaning . because , at the end of the day , it is the problem of non - perturbative regularization of chiral gauge theories , which in turn are at the boundary of the standard model .    and , to add insult to injury ,",
    "this is one of the main reasons for the very slow progress in numerical simulations of qcd .",
    "the fastest supercomputers ever built have been traditionally used by qcd only to feel in their guts of gates and wires the difficulties of the doubling problem .",
    "what i am trying to say is that the lure is still strong , the problem is still theoretically very interesting and numerical simulations can still benefit a great deal from improved lattice fermion methods .",
    "so , for better or for worse , here are staggered domain wall fermions , sdwf @xcite .",
    "as is well known , even naive lattice fermions are not equivalent to 16 diagonal flavors .",
    "otherwise there would be 255 naive pions .",
    "but there are only 15 . even in naive lattice fermions",
    "there is inherent flavor mixing .",
    "traditional wilson fermions `` hide ''",
    "this mixing by raising the doubler masses but staggered fermions `` retain '' the mixing . depending on your point of view this is interesting or plain annoying or perhaps both .",
    "sdwf are a cross between dwf and staggered fermions .",
    "they have an exact u(1)@xmath1u(1 ) chiral symmetry for any @xmath2 ( where @xmath2 is the size of the fifth dimension ) .",
    "the full su(4)@xmath1su(4 ) is recovered at the @xmath3 limit .",
    "sdwf should offer an advantage for simulations of the finite temperature qcd phase transition .",
    "the sdwf dirac operator in the saclay basis @xcite is given in @xcite .",
    "the free theory exhibits localization provided that : @xmath4 ^ 2 < 1   \\label{eq : free_loc_cond_3}\\ ] ] this is shown in fig . 1 for @xmath5 components near @xmath6 .",
    "0.2truein    the symmetry content for any @xmath2 is :    \\a ) u(1 ) @xmath1 u(1 ) axial symmetry .",
    "the relevant operator is @xmath7 .",
    "\\b ) rotations by @xmath8 , in planes perpendicular to the extra dimension ( as in staggered fermions ) .",
    "\\c ) @xmath9-parity .",
    "however , @xmath10 is not invariant unless the @xmath11 direction is also reflected .",
    "\\d ) the shift by one lattice spacing is broken for @xmath12 . however , this is not considered a problem for sdwf .    the flavor identification is trickier than staggered @xcite . the propagator is given in @xcite .",
    "the effective mass @xmath13 in @xmath14 dimensions is similar to dwf . for @xmath2 odd : @xmath15",
    "the sdwf transfer matrix is : @xmath16 \\end{array } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : transfer_mat}\\ ] ] one can easily check that : @xmath17 @xmath18 t is anti - hermitian .",
    "this is different from dwf .",
    "standard transfer matrix manipulations should be done with the hermitian transfer matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 hamiltonian is proportional to the identity in flavor .",
    "no flavor mixing at all ...",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 this @xmath23 is very similar to dwf .",
    "however , a zero eigenvalue for @xmath23 does not imply an eigenvalue of magnitude @xmath24 for @xmath25 at any @xmath26 . only at @xmath20 .",
    "this is different from dwf . for @xmath27 ,",
    "all crossings are in @xmath28 .",
    "to investigate the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath30 , one can eliminate @xmath31 as in dwf .",
    "this leads to a pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath32 . for @xmath33",
    "all crossings are in @xmath34 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath25 is doubly degenerate because @xmath37 . for a degenerate four - flavor theory , @xmath38 must have four zero crossings at the same @xmath29 with the same chirality . for _ any",
    "_ su(2 ) field the degeneracy is always four - fold .    for a smooth non - trivial su(3 ) instanton configuration ( plaquette @xmath39 ) the eigenvalues are almost exactly four - fold degenerate .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "2 . at every crossing ,",
    "four eigenvalues of the same chirality cross . for a very rough su(3 ) gauge field configuration ( plaquette @xmath40 ) the four - fold degeneracy of @xmath41 splits to two - fold , but only by a small amount .",
    "this is shown in table 1 for one of the worst cases on a @xmath42 lattice .",
    "numerical simulations are done in the single component basis . for various approaches",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for example , the standard transcription from the saclay basis to the single component basis can be used . when gauge fields are present , the transcription carries a jacobian that is a function of the gauge fields .",
    "since the gauge field dependent part of the fermionic and pv actions is identical , the jacobians must cancel ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    ".the near zero spectrum of @xmath38 for @xmath43 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "\\1 ) for qcd the nearly four - fold crossing degeneracy must be investigated more thoroughly .",

    "\\3 ) a full hamiltonian analysis is needed .",
    "\\4 ) the kogut - sinclair @xcite 4-fermion interaction with sdwf can be used to span the finite temperature qcd phase transition at zero quark mass .",
