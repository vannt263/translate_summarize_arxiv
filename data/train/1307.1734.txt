    "lorentz and cpt violation has recently received substantial attention as a potential signature for underlying physics , possibly arising from the planck scale .",
    "the most simple lorentz- and cpt - breaking field theory consists of a three dimensional chern - simons term embedded in maxwell s four dimensional classical electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "such model , usually known as carroll - field - jackiw , is part of the standard - model extension ( sme ) , the general field - theory framework for lorentz and cpt tests , which contains the standard model of particle physics and general relativity as limiting cases @xcite .",
    "recent studies in the context of the cpt - odd sector of sme , have been carried out in different areas such as radiative corrections @xcite , nontrivial spacetime topology @xcite , causality @xcite , supersymmetry @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite , general relativity 11 and topological defects , specifically monopole structures was presented in @xcite and , the first investigation about bps vortex solutions in the presence of cpt - even lorentz - violating terms of the sme was performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the higgs models with the maxwell term , support topologically stable vortex solutions @xcite . with a specific choice of coupling constants ,",
    "minimum energy vortex configurations satisfy first order differential equations @xcite .",
    "when this occur the model presents another interesting feature , which says us that the model is the bosonic sector of a supersymmetric theory @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional matter field interacting with gauge fields whose dynamics is governed by a chern - simons term support soliton solutions jk . when self - interactions are suitably chosen vortex configurations satisfy the bogomolnyi - type equations with a specific sixth order potential @xcite .",
    "another important feature of the chern - simons gauge field is that inherits its dynamics from the matter fields to which it is coupled , so it may be either relativistic @xcite or non - relativistic @xcite .",
    "in addition the soliton solutions are of topological and non - topological nature @xcite .",
    "the relativistic chern - simons - higgs model described in ref.jw , was generalized to include a maxwell term for the gauge field in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , the authors , in order to maintain a notion of self - duality , in which a lower bound for the energy is saturated by solutions to a set of self - duality equations , introduce an additional neutral scalar field .",
    "in this paper we are interested in studying bps vortices in a context of a cpt - odd and lorentz - violating abelian higgs system , involving both the maxwell and chern - simons terms , which is obtained from carroll - field - jackiw theory by dimensional reduction . in particular",
    ", we will show that this model support self - dual vortex solutions , which are different from those obtained in ref .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that in our model the neutral scalar field appears naturally from the dimensional reduction , so that the model is self - dual without the requirement to introduce an additional neutral field such as in ref .",
    "in addition we show that the vortex solution are identical in form to the nielsen - olesen vortices , although , in our model , the vortex possess electric charge .",
    "let us start by considering the lorentz and cpt - violating maxwell - chern - simons theory , proposed by carroll , field , and jackiw cfj @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a four - vector couples to electromagnetic field , which determines a preferred direction in spacetime violating lorentz as well as cpt symmetry , and @xmath2 is the stress tensor defined by @xmath3 . here , the term @xmath4 represents the coupling between the gauge field and an external current .",

    "specifically , we are interested in exploring the solitonic structure of the model obtained from ( [ ac2 ] ) via dimensional reduction . in particular we are motivated by searching of a model with maxwell - chern - simons self - dual vortex solutions different from those present in ref .",
