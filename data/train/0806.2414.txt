    "rna pseudoknot structures have drawn a lot of attention over the last decade @xcite . from micro - rna binding to ribosomal frameshifts @xcite , we currently discover novel rna functionalities at truly amazing rates . our conceptional understanding of rna pseudoknot structures has not kept up with this pace .",
    "only recently the generating functions of @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures of arc - length @xmath8 @xcite , arc - length @xmath1 @xcite and canonical @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures of arc - length @xmath8 @xcite have been derived . while these combinatorial results open new perspectives for the design of new folding algorithms , it has to be noted that realistic pseudoknot structures are subject to a minimum arc - length @xmath1 and stack - length @xmath9 . therefore the above structure classes are not `` best possible '' .",
    "the lack of a transparent target class of rna pseudoknot structures represents a problem for _ ab initio _ prediction algorithms .",
    "there are four algorithms , capable of the energy based prediction of certain pseudoknots in polynomial time : rivas  _ et al .",
    "_ ( dynamic programming , gap - matrices , @xmath10 time and @xmath11 space ) @xcite , uemura _ et al . _",
    "( @xmath12 time and @xmath11 space , tree - adjoining grammars ) @xcite , akutsu @xcite and lyngso @xcite .",
    "all of them follow the dynamic programming paradigm and none produces an easily specifiable class of pseudoknots as output .    in this paper",
    "we characterize a class of pseudoknot rna structures in which bonds have a minimum length of four and stacks contains at least three base pairs .",
    "our results show that this structure class is ideally suited as _ a priori_-output for prediction algorithms .",
    "tab.[t:1 ] indicates that this class remains suitable even for more complex pseudoknots ( specified in terms of larger sets of _ mutually _ crossing bonds ) .",
    "in fact , one can search rna @xmath13-noncrossing pseudoknot structure with arc - length @xmath1 and stack - length @xmath14 for a sequence of length @xmath15 w.r.t .  a variety of objective functions ( in particular loop - based minimum free energy models ) on a @xmath16-core pc in a few minutes @xcite .    in order to put our results into context , we turn the clock back by almost three decades .",
    "1978 m.  waterman _",
    "_ @xcite began deriving the concepts for enumeration and prediction of rna secondary structures .",
    "the latter represent arguably _ the _ prototype of prediction - targets of rna structures .",
    "rna secondary structures are coarse grained structures which can be represented as outer - planar graphs , diagrams , motzkin - paths or words over `` @xmath17 '' `` @xmath18 '' and `` @xmath19 '' .",
    "their decisive feature is that they have no two crossing bonds , see fig.[f : ma_reid1.eps ] .",
    "let @xmath20}(n)$ ] denote the number of secondary structures with arc - length @xmath21 over @xmath22=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] .",
    "the key to rna secondary structures is the following recursion for @xmath20}(n)$ ] : @xmath23}(n)={\\sf t}_2^{[\\lambda]}(n-1)+ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-(\\lambda+1)}{\\sf t}_2^{[\\lambda]}(n-2-j){\\sf t}_2^{[\\lambda]}(j),\\ ] ] where @xmath20}(n)=1 $ ] for @xmath24 .",
    "the latter follows from considering the concatenation of motzkin - paths with minimum peak length @xmath25 .",
    "( [ e : sn ] ) implies for the generating function @xmath26}(z)= \\sum_{n\\geq 0}{\\sf t}_2^{[\\lambda]}(n)z^n$ ] the functional equation @xmath27}(z)^2- ( 1-z+z^2+\\cdots+z^\\lambda){\\bf t}_2^{[\\lambda]}(z)+1=0\\ ] ] from which eventually @xmath28}(z ) = \\frac{-1 + 2z-2z^2+z^{\\lambda+1}+\\sqrt{1 - 4z+4z^2 - 2z^{\\lambda+1}+ 4z^{\\lambda+2}-4z^{\\lambda+3}+z^{2\\lambda+2 } } } { 2(z^3-z^2)}\\ ] ] follows .",
    "therefore , minimum arc - length restrictions do not impose particular difficulties for rna secondary structures .",
    "in fact minimum stack size conditions can also be dealt with straightforwardly .",
    "we furthermore note that eq .",
    "( [ e : sn ] ) is a _ constructive _ recursion , i.e.  it allows to inductively build secondary structures over @xmath22 $ ] from those over @xmath29 $ ] , for all @xmath30 .    in order to analyze rna structure with crossing bonds ,",
    "we recall the notion of @xmath0-noncrossing diagrams @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-noncrossing diagram is a labeled graph over the vertex set @xmath22 $ ] with vertex degrees @xmath31 , represented by drawing its vertices @xmath32 in a horizontal line and its arcs @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , in the upper half - plane , containing at most @xmath35 mutually crossing arcs . the vertices and arcs correspond to nucleotides and watson - crick ( * a - u * , * g - c * ) and ( * u - g * ) base pairs , respectively .",
    "diagrams have the following three key parameters : the maximum number of mutually crossing arcs , @xmath35 , the minimum arc - length , @xmath36 and minimum stack - length , @xmath37 ( @xmath38-diagrams ) . the length of an arc @xmath33 is @xmath39 and a stack of length @xmath37 is a sequence of `` parallel '' arcs of the form @xmath40 , see fig.[f : ma_reid2.eps ] .",
    "we call an arc of length @xmath36 a @xmath36-arc",
    ". let @xmath41}(n)$ ] denote the set of @xmath0-noncrossing diagrams with minimum arc- and stack - length @xmath36 and @xmath37 and let @xmath42}(n)$ ] denote their number .    in the following , we shall identify pseudoknot rna structures with @xmath0-noncrossing diagrams and refer to them as @xmath38-structures .",
    "pseudoknot rna structures occur in functional rna ( rnasep ) @xcite , ribosomal rna @xcite and plant viral rnas and vitro rna evolution experiments have produced families of rna structures with pseudoknot motifs @xcite . in fig.[f : ma_reid3.eps ] we give several representations of the utr - pseudoknot of the mouse hepatitis virus .    due to",
    "the crossings of arcs pseudoknots differs considerably from secondary structures : pseudoknot rna structures are inherently non - inductive and no analogue of eq .",

    "one key for the generating function of @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures @xmath43}(z)$ ] was the bijection of chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained in the context of @xmath0-noncrossing partitions .",
    "this bijection has been generalized to @xmath0-noncrossing tangled diagrams @xcite , a class of contact - structures tailored for expressing rna tertiary interactions . via the bijection @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures",
    "can be identified with certain walks in @xmath44 that remain in the region @xmath45 starting and ending at @xmath46 , the boundaries of which are called walls .",
    "the enumeration of these walks is obtained employing the reflection principle .",
    "this method is due to andr@xmath47 in @xmath48 @xcite and has subsequently been generalized by gessel and zeilberger @xcite . in the reflection principle `` bad''-i.e .",
    "reflected- walks cancel themselves .",
    "in other words one enumerates all walks and due to cancellation only the ones survive that never touch the walls . despite its beauty this method does not trigger any algorithmic intuition and is nonconstructive .",
    "moreover , @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures can not directly be enumerated via the reflection principle : it does not preserve a minimum arc - length . in @xcite it is shown how to eliminate specific classes of arcs after reflection .",
    "one nontrivial implication of this theory is that all generating functions for @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures are @xmath49-finite , i.e.  there exists a _",
    "nonconstructive _ recurrence relation of finite length with polynomial coefficients for @xmath42}(n)$ ] .",
    "note however , that although we can prove the existence of this recurrence it is at present not known for _ any _ @xmath50 . in fig.[f : ma_reid4.eps ] we illustrate the key steps for the enumeration of @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures @xcite .",
    "once @xmath3}(z)$ ] is known we employ singularity analysis and study its dominant singularities , using hankel contours .",
    "this ansatz has been pioneered by p.  flajolet and a.m.  odlyzko @xcite .",
    "its basic idea is the construction of an `` singular - analogue '' of the taylor - expansion .",
    "it can be shown that , under certain conditions , there exists an approximation , which is locally of the same order as the original function .",
    "the particular , local approximation allows then to derive the asymptotic form of the coefficients . in our situation all conditions for singularity analysis are met , since all our generating functions are @xmath49-finite @xcite and @xmath49-finite functions have an analytic continuation into any simply - connected domain containing zero .",
