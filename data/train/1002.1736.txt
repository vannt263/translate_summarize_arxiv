    "the advent of genome - wide transcriptomics using high - throughput sequencing technologies and the recent discovery of regulatory non - coding rnas ( ncrnas ) have made it clear that rna plays a large variety of important roles in living organisms that are more complex than being a mere intermediate in protein biosynthesis .",
    "a large portion of these ncrnas regulate gene expression post - transcriptionally through binding and forming base pairs ( and establishing a joint structure ) with a target mrna , like micro rnas and small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) @xcite , antisense rnas  @xcite or bacterial small regulatory rnas ( srnas ) @xcite .",

    "there are algorithms for predicting the most likely ( the lowest total free energy ) joint structure that can be formed by two interacting rna strands @xcite .",
    "also , recently powerful algorithms for computing the partition function of interacting nucleic acid strands have been given ( see our previous work @xcite , for example , or @xcite ) .",

    "similar to the approach of @xcite , sampled structures are clustered and the centroids of the clusters are considered as candidate structures . we believe success of such an approach critically depends on the clustering method , therefore , we leave sampling - clustering algorithms for a separate study .",
