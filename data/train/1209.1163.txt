    "gamma ray burst(grbs ) are extremely high energy releasing phenomena in the universe and are usually divided into two classes @xcite : short grbs ( @xmath6s ) and long grbs ( @xmath7s ) .",
    "numerous models have been proposed to explore the central engines of grbs , and one of the mostly discussed model is the neutrino dominated accretion flows ( ndafs ) with a hyper accreting stellar massive black hole with accretion rate @xmath8/s . due to the high density and high temperature in the inner part of ndafs ,",
    "the optical depth of photons is very large and photons are completely trapped , then neutrinos and antineutrinos become the most promising candidates that carry away thermal energy and cool the disk .",
    "the annihilation of neutrino pairs above the disk is believed to be the energy source of grbs .",
    "@xcite first proposed that neutrino pairs annihilation into electron pairs during the merger of compact objects binaries may power grbs .",
    "after that , @xcite investigated ndafs under the assumption that the disk is transparent to neutrinos , but they also pointed out that the assumption fails when the accretion rate is higher than @xmath5/s .",
    "@xcite improved the model by using a simplified neutrino transport model which was believed to bridge the neutrino optically thin limit and optically thick limit .",
    "@xcite improved the model further by dealing with the neutrino emission and chemical composition in the optically thin regime , optically thick regime and intermediate regime separately .",
    "though many works on ndafs have confirmed the validity of the ndafs model as the central engine of grbs @xcite , there are still some uncertainties including : 1 , the distribution of electron fraction . in many previous works , which is assumed to be a constant value , for example , 0.5 , throughout the disk . while the electron fraction has a great effect on the emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos , as shown by @xcite , so need more cautious disposal .",
    "2 , neutrino transport and neutrino spectra .",
    "the most commonly used approximation was the simplified neutrino transport model introduced in @xcite",
    ". in their model , the difference between the neutrino and antineutrino transport in the disk was neglected , but as shown in @xcite , the precise spectra of neutrino and antineutrino sensitively determines the annihilation luminosity of neutrino pairs .",
    "3 , the annihilation of neutrino pairs .",
    "the most common method for calculating the annihilation luminosity was originally introduced by to calculate the annihilation luminosity during the merger of neutron star binaries .",
    "this method was applied in the calculation of the annihilation luminosity above ndafs under the assumption that the emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos are isotropic and symmetric @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the most strict approach to determine the neutrino / antineutrino luminosity and their annihilation luminosity above ndafs is to build the two - dimensional disk model in which neutrino transport , vertical structure , chemical evolution , thermal evolution and the distribution of electron fraction , mass density , and temperature are self consistently considered .",
    "first investigated the vertical structure of ndafs by using the eddington approximation to deal with the neutrino transport in the vertical direction , neglecting the contribution of advection term to the disk cooling , and dealing with neutrino emission and chemical composition following the similar method of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite also investigated the vertical structure of ndafs with many simplifications on neutrino transport , equation of state and the annihilation efficiency .",
    "the first one is that the neutrino emission is directly integrated to calculate the neutrino luminosity by neglecting the absorption of neutrinos , which is viable in the neutrino optically thin limit @xcite ; the second one , that a simplified equation of state @xmath9 is used in the vertical direction , which is viable when relativistic degenerate electrons dominate the pressure of the disk ; the third one that a toy annihilation efficiency of neutrino pairs @xmath10 is applied , where @xmath11 is the annihilation luminosity and neutrino luminosity before annihilation respectively , and @xmath12 is the so called annihilation volume . with all the above simplifications , the annihilation efficiency @xmath13 can even reach @xmath14 !",
    "obviously , the unrealistic result is caused by too many unrealistic assumptions .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the vertical structure of ndafs , neutrino / antineutrino luminosity and their annihilation luminosity by self - consistently considering the neutrino / antineutrino transport , the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , the precise equation of state , the chemical equilibrium and the thermal balance between neutrino cooling , advection cooling and the viscosity heating under the self similar assumption of the distribution of mass density and internal energy density in the radial direction .",
    "especially , we strictly solve the bolzmann equation to deal with the neutrino transport , instead of taking the assumption of the gray body spectra @xcite or the eddington approximation .",
    "correspondingly , we can precisely obtain the energy spectra of neutrino pairs . combining the conservation of the number of lepton , the distribution of chemical compositions are self - consistently and accurately determined .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "ii , we introduce the basic equations in our calculation , including the boltzmann equation of neutrino / antineutrino transport , angular momentum equation , hydrostatic equilibrium equation , equation of state , lepton number conservation equation and thermal evolution equation . in  iii , we briefly introduce our numerical methods to find the steady solution of the structure of the disk . in ",
    "iv , we list our numerical results of the disk structure , neutrino / antineutrino luminosity and their annihilation luminosity . conclusions and discussions are summarized in  v.",
    "we assume a steady accretion disk with accretion rate @xmath15/s around a central black hole with mass @xmath16 and adopt the standard @xmath17 viscosity prescription of with @xmath3 for the viscous stress of the disk .",
    "we discuss the structure of the disk and neutrino transport in cylindrical coordinate @xmath18 and we assume the inner boundary of the disk to be @xmath19 and outer boundary to be @xmath20 .",
    "we solve the one dimensional boltzmann equation of neutrino and antineutrino transport in the vertical direction of the disk and obtain the energy dependent and direction dependent neutrino spectrum .",
    "we define @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be the distribution function for up moving neutrinos / antineutrinos and down moving ones respectively , where @xmath23 is the vertical coordinate of the disk , @xmath24 is the energy of neutrinos / antineutrinos , and @xmath25 for up moving neutrinos / antineutrinos and @xmath26 for down moving ones , where @xmath27 is the angle of neutrinos / antineutrinos moving direction to the vertical direction of the disk . for the up - moving neutrinos / antineutrinos , their distribution function is determined by @xcite : @xmath28+\\lambda_s\\left[-f_+(z , p,\\mu)+\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\mu f_-(z , p,\\mu)+f_+(z , p,\\mu)\\right],\\ ] ] and for the down - moving ones , their distribution function is determined by @xmath29-\\lambda_s\\left[-f_-(z , p,\\mu)+\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\mu f_-(z , p,\\mu)+f_+(z , p,\\mu)\\right].\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the absorption coefficient and @xmath31 is the scattering coefficient of neutrinos / antineutrinos , and here @xmath32 for neutrinos , @xmath33 for anti - neutrinos , where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the chemical potential of electron , proton and neutron , respectively .    because urca process @xmath36 and @xmath37 dominate the creation and the absorption of neutrinos and antineutrinos , and the neutrino / antineutrino scattering by neutrons and protons @xmath38 and @xmath39 dominates the scattering opacity @xcite , so we include no other neutrino / antineutrino processes .",
    "thus , for simplicity , in this paper we use @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 interchangeably and it will not cause any confusion . as for the explicit expression of the absorption coefficient @xmath30 and scattering coefficient @xmath31 of neutrinos / antineutrinos , please refer to @xcite .",

    "it is the specific distribution of the electron fraction that guarantees the chemical equilibrium , which was not included in the most previous works , as a result , the electron fraction has to be an artificial assumption there .",
    "it is noticeable that the vertical distribution of @xmath149 and electron fraction @xmath156 are positively correlated ( fig.2c and 2d ) .",
    "the positive correlation implies that relativistic electrons dominate the pressure at the surface of the disk where @xmath157 , and non - relativistic protons and neutrons dominated the pressure at the bottom of the disk where @xmath158 . to justify the conclusion , we plot the vertical distribution of the ratio @xmath159 at radius @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the fig.3 , where @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",

    ", the self similar assumption of mass density @xmath51 and internal energy density @xmath63 in the radial direction is rather a self consistent and accurate description .",
    "now we give a more physical explanation about the self - similar behavior in the radial direction : according to fig.2 and fig.3 , it is evident that non - relativistic protons and neutrons dominate total pressure at the bottom of the disk and determine the surface density of the disk .",
    "hence , we use the polytropic equation of state @xmath169 to estimate vertical structure of the disk . combining eq.(7 ) and",
    "( 8) , it is easy to get the scale thickness of the disk @xmath170 , and the mass density @xmath108 . in order to estimate the radial behavior of temperature and pressure , we must consider the more general eos of non - relativistic gas @xmath171 , and the thermal balance between viscosity heating and neutrino cooling @xmath172 or @xmath173 , so @xmath174 , consequently @xmath168 and @xmath175 ( see fig4 ) .    in order to gain an insight to the nature of the disk we investigate",
    ", we also calculate the advection factor @xmath176 where @xmath112 and @xmath100 are the advection cooling rate and heating rate defined in the  ii , and the result is shown in fig.5a .",
    "so it is evident that the disk is indeed a neutrino cooling dominated accretion disk as its name suggests : neutrino radiation dominates the cooling process and advection is always a minor role .",
    "the self similar assumption is only applied in the calculation of the advection term , so even if there is some small deviation between the realistic distribution and the self - similar assumption as shown in fig.4 , it has no much influence on the final results .",
    "thus the self similar assumption is rather a reasonable simplification .",
    "the number density of helium @xmath177 is expressed as @xmath178 where the fraction of free nucleons @xmath179 ( protons and neutrons ) is given by @xcite @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the mass density in unit of @xmath182 g/@xmath90 and @xmath183 is the temperature in unit of @xmath184 k and if @xmath185 , then @xmath186 .",

    "temperature of the inner part of ndafs sensitively determines the final luminosity of neutrino annihilation as @xmath234 . in the extreme model of this paper ( @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath3 )",
    ", it is found that temperature in the inner part of the disk is about @xmath237 mev , and the corresponding annihilation luminosity is about @xmath238 ergs / s which roughly satisfies the energy demand of the most energetic grbs .",
    "if the temperature of disks changes from 8 mev to 4mev , the annihilation luminosity reduces about 500 times , which is not enough to power the fireball of the most energetic grbs with the isotropic luminosity about @xmath239 ergs / s . in the standard model of grbs ,",
    "the duration of the energy injection is the duration of the grb prompt emission , which could be about 2s for short grbs and about 100 - 1000s for long bursts .",
    "assuming an extreme constant accretion rate of 10 msun / s means therefore an enormous total mass consumption for powering grbs , especially for powering long bursts , which might be realistic .",
    "therefore , the simple ndaf model which is investigated in this work can not produce sufficient energy to power grbs , the effects of the spin of black hole or / and the magnetic field in the accretion flow might be introduced to power the central engine of grbs .",
    "it is very easy to understand that the temperature of the inner disk mainly depends on the accretion rate of the flow . besides the extreme model",
    ", we also investigate the models with the lower accretion rate , such as @xmath240/s and @xmath241/s , and the results including the resulting temperature @xmath66 in the inner part of disk @xmath242 , neutrino and antineutrino luminosity @xmath243 , annihilation luminosity @xmath217 and the corresponding annihilation efficiency @xmath244 are listed in table 1 .",
    "for all the three different accretion rate @xmath245/s , the thickness @xmath199 we defined in  4.2.3 is roughly equal to radius @xmath55 .",
    "it is obvious that , accretion rate sensitively determines the annihilation luminosity of neutrino pairs and the annihilation luminosity will not exceed @xmath4 ergs / s when the corresponding accretion rate is lower than @xmath246/s .",
    "so ndafs with accretion rate lower than @xmath246/s are unlikely to serve as central engines of grbs .",
    "neutrino and antineutrino spectra is the second major factor determining the annihilation luminosity .",
    "the resulting neutrinos and antineutrino spectra obtained by solving the boltzmann equation shows that , when the disk is in chemical equilibrium , the emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos are almost symmetric with nearly identical energy spectra , but the spectra is neither in the form of black body nor in the form of the gray body . and as shown in @xcite , the black body spectra of neutrino and the neutrino spectra based on the most commonly used simplified model of neutrino transport @xcite or equivalently the gray body spectra @xcite can overestimate the annihilation luminosity by nearly one order of magnitude . in the following , we will also check the validity of the previous assumption on the neutrino transport .",
    "it is easy to estimate the mean optical depth of neutrinos in the inner part of the disk . from fig .",
    "6a and fig .",
    "2b , at @xmath154 , the surface density is @xmath247 g/@xmath141 and the temperature is @xmath207mev .",
    "according to @xcite , the neutrino opacity of absorption @xmath248 and scattering @xmath249 are expressed as @xmath250 @xmath251 where @xmath183 is the temperature in unit of @xmath184k and @xmath252 is the surface density in unit of @xmath202 g/@xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the optical depth of neutrinos we get is @xmath253 , so the disk is optically thick for neutrinos at @xmath208 .",
    "however , as @xcite has shown in quasi - optically opaque case ( @xmath254 ) , the neutrino spectra are neither the black body spectra @xmath255 @xcite nor the gray body spectra @xmath256 @xcite : @xmath257 and the block factor @xmath258 is given by @xmath259 where @xmath260 , so here @xmath261 .    for comparison , we plot the direction - averaged spectra @xmath212 of the black body spectra , the gray body spectra and the more realistic spectra obtained by solving boltzmann equation ( see fig.9 ) . according to fig.9 , it is obvious that the first assumption on neutrino transport overestimates the neutrino luminosity about @xmath262 and the corresponding annihilation luminosity about @xmath263 , while the second assumption underestimates the neutrino luminosity about 5 times and the corresponding annihilation luminosity about 25 times .",
    "it may explain why @xcite drew a conclusion that the annihilation luminosity of ndafs is no more than @xmath4 ergs / s , so ndafs can not serve as the central engine of grbs , on the contrary , @xcite claimed an opposite conclusion .",
    "the thickness of the disk is the third factor that affects the final annihilation luminosity : a larger ratio of thickness to radius means a larger solid angle the disk subtends to the annihilation zone . in the case",
    "we consider , the thick disk ( @xmath201 ) will enhance the annihilation luminosity about 3 times than that of a thin disk .",
    "the significance of the distribution of electron fraction in ndafs has been discussed by many previous works @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the distribution of electron fraction is a natural result of chemical equilibrium , thermal balance and hydrostatic equilibrium , rather than an artificial assumption in most previous works , so which should be most reliable .    as shown in fig .",
    "5 , helium is completely absent within @xmath264 of ndafs , so it is not needed to consider the contribution of helium to the total pressure and internal energy or the contribution of helium disintegration to the cooling of the disk .",
    "it should be emphasized that our calculation also has its own limitations .",
    "first , in this work , the disk is thick and has two dimensional structure , while the neutrino transport is treated in one dimension .",
    "second , the effects of the motion of accretion flow and the curved spacetime on the vertical transport of neutrinos are neglected .",
    "these effects are significant in the inner part of the disk , for example , at @xmath208 , the special relativity correction to the neutrino energy can be @xmath265 , and the general relativity correction to the energy can be @xmath266 .",
    "third , in the zone near to the event horizon of the central black hole where the annihilation concentrates , the trajectories of neutrinos are severely bent by the central black hole and a considerable amount of neutrinos will undoubtedly be captured by the hole .",
    "in addition , the gravitational instability of the disk was proposed by @xcite to explain the energetic x - ray flares after the prompt emission in grbs .",
    "the outer region of ndafs with extremely high accretion rate is gravitational unstable @xcite , will fragment and cause a variable accretion rate in the inner region .",
    "we would like to thank the annonymous referee for her / his constructive suggestions and comments which are helpful for the improvement of this paper .",
