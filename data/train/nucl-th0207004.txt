    "fermi liquid theory is a prototype effective theory , invented by landau in the late 1950 s  @xcite . in this theory",
    "the properties of normal fermi liquids at zero temperature are encoded in a few parameters , which are related to the effective two - fermion interaction . over the years",
    ", fermi liquid theory has proven to be an extremely useful tool for studying normal fermi liquids , in particular liquid @xmath1he  @xcite .",
    "the main assumption is that the elementary , low - lying excitations of the interacting system are relatively long - lived quasiparticles , with properties resembling those of free particles .",
    "the remaining strength in the spectral function is distributed over modes that add up incoherently . in the language of the renormalization group ,",
    "the incoherent background is integrated out into the quasiparticle interaction , which can be determined by comparison with experiment or by microscopic calculations .",
    "babu and brown later realized  @xcite that , in order to satisfy the pauli principle in microscopic calculations , one has to take into account not only the particle - hole channel considered by landau , which gives rise to the propagation of zero sound , but also the exchange channel thereof .",
    "this is taken into account in the induced interaction , which incorporates the response of the many - body medium to the presence of the quasiparticles .",
    "almost a decade ago , shankar revived the interest in fermi liquid theory by developing a renormalization group ( rg ) approach to interacting fermi systems ( for an introduction see shankar  @xcite and the lecture notes of polchinski  @xcite ) .",
    "since fermi liquid theory is restricted to low - lying excitations in the vicinity of the fermi surface , normal fermi systems are amenable to the renormalization group , where one has precisely such a separation of modes in mind .",
    "moreover , by taking the loop contributions from both particle - hole channels into account , the rg flow remains antisymmetric , i.e. , at any step of the renormalization , the scattering amplitude obeys the pauli principle and consequently the solution obeys the pauli principle sum rules .",
    "thus , the antisymmetry of the scattering amplitude , which was the guiding principle of babu and brown , is realized naturally in the rg approach .",
    "recently , we obtained additional rg invariant constraints  @xcite .",
    "these approximate constraints are analogous to those obtained by bedell and ainsworth for paramagnetic fermi liquids  @xcite .    in this paper , we solve the one - loop rg equations in the particle - hole channels at zero temperature and in three dimensions .",
    "we work in the approximation that both particle - hole momentum transfers are small compared to the fermi momentum .",
    "the justification for this approximation is two - fold : in fermi liquid theory the long - wavelength excitations play a central role .",
    "hence , our primary aim is to treat these correctly .",
    "furthermore , for the case of nuclear or neutron matter , the dependence of the induced interaction on landau angle is fairly weak  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect an expansion in momentum transfers to be accurate at least for the fermi liquid parameters . in this approximation",
    "the treatment of the particle - hole phase space with cutoffs is enormously simplified .",
    "an rg analysis of a schematic model , including the complete particle - hole phase space in two dimensions , is discussed in  @xcite . improved rg equations , beyond one - loop order ,",
    "are presented in  @xcite .    here",
    "we apply the rg techniques to neutron matter , where the tensor force does not contribute in the s - wave . in this system , a further physical motivation for expanding in small momentum transfers over the fermi momentum",
    "is provided by the unique low momentum nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath4  @xcite , which we employ as the starting point for the rg flow . as shown in figs .  2 and  4 of bogner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 is significant only for relative momenta @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , from the evolution of @xmath0 shown in fig .  5 of",
    "@xcite we deduce that the important momentum modes are around the pion mass @xmath6 , since higher momenta do not renormalize @xmath0 considerably .",
    "therefore , the typical momentum transfer is small compared to the fermi momentum of neutron matter at nuclear matter density @xmath7 .",
    "the main idea of the rg approach to the many - body problem is to `` adiabatically '' include the in medium corrections to the effective interaction by solving the rg flow equations in the relevant channels . in this exploratory calculation",
    "we include the particle - hole channels , which play a special role in fermi liquid theory .",
    "the main effect of scattering in the particle - particle channel , the removal of the short - range repulsion , is taken care of by using @xmath0 as the starting point for the rg flow .",
    "the low - lying excitations in this channel , which are responsible e.g. , for superfluidity , are not included .",
    "these are then treated explicitly in section  [ gapsec ] , where we compute the superfluid gap by employing bcs theory for the particle - hole reducible scattering amplitude .    in the rg approach ,",
    "the width of the momentum shell that is integrated out in one iteration is a `` small parameter '' .",
    "the full scattering amplitude is an rg invariant quantity . in a conventional approach , this is calculated from a `` set of diagrams '' while in the rg approach it is continuously evolved from the starting interaction by gradually including the many - body corrections from the narrow momentum shells one at a time . in this sense",
    "the rg provides a method for dealing with strongly interacting systems , where perturbation theory fails .",
    "we stress that this application of the renormalization group to many - body systems is only indirectly related to the well known rg treatment of critical phenomena .",
    "we derive the one - loop renormalization group equations for the quasiparticle interaction and the scattering amplitude at zero temperature .",
    "the evolution of the effective mass is included in the rg flow , as well as a simplified treatment of the renormalization of the quasiparticle strength . in the forward scattering limit , the role of the energy transfer is in the rg taken over by the cutoff in momentum space .",
    "we find that , in the long - wavelength limit , the dependence of the effective four - point vertex on @xmath8 corresponds to the behavior with @xmath9 in the microscopic derivation of fermi liquid theory by landau .",
    "finally , we present the solution of the rg equations for neutron matter . these are obtained by employing the unique low momentum nucleon - nucleon interaction as the initial condition of the rg .",
    "our results include the fermi liquid parameters in the density range of interest for neutron stars as well as the full scattering amplitude for general ( non - forward ) scattering on the fermi surface . using the fermi liquid parameters , we compute the equation of state , including polarization effects , by integrating the incompressibility  @xcite . finally , we compute the @xmath2s@xmath3 superfluid pairing gap using weak coupling bcs theory .",
    "this is an application of our approach , which probes the angular dependence of the scattering amplitude .",
    "we generally find very good agreement with the results obtained in the polarization potential model by ainsworth , wambach and pines  @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that much of the model dependence , inherent in the work of ainsworth _ et al .",
    "_ , can be avoided in the rg approach .",
    "shankar suggested that the relevant modes of a normal fermi system may be isolated in a similar manner as for critical phenomena .",
    "in analogy with a wilson - kadanoff treatment of the latter  @xcite , he proposed to separate the `` slow '' modes from the `` fast '' centered around the fermi momentum @xmath10 , whereas the `` fast '' modes lie outside this shell . ] ones by imposing a cutoff around the fermi surface  @xcite . using a loop expansion",
    ", one can systematically generate the effective quasiparticle scattering amplitude and the effective quasiparticle interaction among slow quasiparticles and slow quasiholes at a given scale @xmath11 .",
    "interpolates between the two - body irreducible interaction and the full scattering amplitude as described in the introduction . ]",
    "it has been shown that , in this approach , fermi liquid theory emerges in the infrared limit when the cutoff is taken to zero  @xcite .",
    "recently we derived the flow equations for the effective scattering amplitude and the quasiparticle interaction from the induced interaction of babu and brown  @xcite . in this paper , we employ the one - loop rg equations to compute the full scattering amplitude and the quasiparticle interaction on the fermi surface starting from the vacuum two - body interaction .",
    "as we decimate down to the fermi surface by letting @xmath12 , we obtain not only the forward scattering amplitude for low - lying quasiparticle - quasihole excitations , but also the amplitude for general ( non - forward ) scattering processes of quasiparticles on the fermi surface in the small momentum approximation .    in a loop expansion , the induced interaction corresponds to a summation of the direct and exchange particle - hole channels in a particular kinematic window , while loop contributions from the particle - particle ( bcs ) channel , are not summed by the rg equations derived in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the contributions from the bcs channel should be included in the particle - hole irreducible driving term . in practice ,",
    "one usually restricts oneself to the two - particle ladders with the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction ( the brueckner @xmath13 matrix ) or a simple generalization thereof , where the lowest order renormalization of the quasiparticle strength is included  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we explore the one - loop truncation of the rg equations . when only one channel is considered , the one - loop rg equation is exact in the sense that it is equivalent to the corresponding scattering equation .",
    "when both the direct and exchange channels are included , the scattering amplitude remains antisymmetric under the rg flow .",
    "calculations with the induced interaction for liquid @xmath1he and nuclear matter show that the systematic inclusion of exchange channel contributions is crucial for obtaining a realistic description of the effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect the one - loop rg to capture the essential physics of the soft modes near the fermi surface . in this approximation ,",

    "<S> renormalization group methods can be applied to the nuclear many - body problem using the approach proposed by shankar . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the two - body low momentum interaction @xmath0 and use the rg flow from the particle - hole channels to calculate the full scattering amplitude in the vicinity of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> this is a new straightforward approach to the many - body problem which is applicable also to condensed matter systems without long - range interactions , such as liquid @xmath1he . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the one - loop renormalization group equations for the quasiparticle interaction and the scattering amplitude at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the rg presents an elegant method to maintain all momentum scales and preserve the antisymmetry of the scattering amplitude . as a first application we solve the rg equations for neutron matter </S>",
    "<S> the resulting quasiparticle interaction includes effects due to the polarization of the medium , the so - called induced interaction of babu and brown . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for the fermi liquid parameters , the equation of state of neutron matter and the @xmath2s@xmath3 superfluid pairing gap .    _ </S>",
