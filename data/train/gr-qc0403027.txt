    "we investigate in detail the special case of an infinitely thin static cylindrical shell composed of counter - rotating photons on circular geodetical paths separating two distinct parts of minkowski spacetimes  one inside and the other outside the shell @xcite  and compare it to a static disk shell formed by null particles counter - rotating on circular geodesics within the shell located between two sections of flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "one might ask whether the two cases are not , in fact , merely one .",
    "inside the shell we have flat spacetime metric in cylindrical coordinates @xmath0 outside , we again have flat spacetime but we use accelerated rindler coordinates : @xmath1 where @xmath2 determines the conicity of the metric @xcite ( @xmath3 $ ] ) .",
    "the relation of this coordinate system to the minkowski coordinates is as follows @xmath4 if we wish to obtain the entire covering minkowski spacetime we must extend the ranges of @xmath5 and @xmath6 to the entire real axis ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a 3-dimensional cylinder in coordinates ( [ rindler metric ] ) with @xmath7 corresponds to a planar strip @xmath8 with @xmath9 and identified edges that moves at the speed @xmath10 from @xmath11 in the distant past , @xmath12 , comes to a stop at @xmath13 and @xmath14 and speeds off to @xmath11 in the distant future , @xmath15 , as follows from . both metrics ( [ cylindrical metric ] ) , ( [ rindler metric ] )",
    "are special cases of the levi - civita metric @xcite .",
    "the two separate systems are connected through a cylindrical hypersurface located at the same coordinate radius @xmath16 , both inside and outside .",
    "the radial coordinate is thus continuous and the remaining coordinates are connected as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are coordinates on the shell itself ( for clarity , coordinates inside and outside the shell are denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 indices , respectively ) . with this definition ,",
    "the 3-dimensional induced metric on the cylindrical shell is identical from both sides and it is flat .",
    "we find the extrinsic curvatures , @xmath21 , of the shell inside and outside and , using israel formalism @xcite , we calculate the induced energy - momentum tensor @xmath22 on the shell ( for details , refer to a more general situation in @xcite ) @xmath23 the resulting energy - momentum tensor is diagonal with zero trace and thus it can be interpreted as streams of counter - rotating photons .",
    "moreover , the axial component of the energy - momentum tensor is zero and so the photons only move in the @xmath24-direction .",
    "since they have constant coordinate velocities , their trajectories are necessarily circular geodesics within the 3-dimensional subspace of the cylindrical shell .",
    "a similar situation with multiple photonic shells has been discussed recently in @xcite ( the authors use the kasner form of the metric)we focus on a special case of a single shell formed by non - helical photons with flat regions both inside and outside .",
    "if we calculate the mass of the shell per unit proper length , @xmath25 , we find out @xmath26 .",
    "it might be surprising that this characteristic mass is not zero since there is flat spacetime both inside and outside of the shell .",
    "however , there is no single _ global _ coordinate system that would enable us to describe the spacetime using the minkowski metric .",
    "in other words the shell _ does _ produce gravitational field since there are freely moving observers who are accelerated towards one another .",
    "let us look at the geodesics of test particles passing through the shell . inside and outside of the cylinder they just move along straight lines at a constant speed ( if we use minkowskian coordinates ) .",
    "crossing the sheet , the projection of the particle s 4-velocity on a chosen tangential triad and the normal vector must be the same on both sides ( we neglect here any interaction with the shell ) .",
    "this gives continuous 4-velocity components except for the temporal component with @xmath27 the direction of motion of the particle thus remains the same but the magnitude of its coordinate velocity changes . outside the shell , we find @xmath28 , \\vspace{0.2 cm } \\hspace{1 cm } & z & = & z_0 + \\dot{z}_0 \\ ; \\tau , \\vspace{0.2 cm } \\\\",
    "\\rho & = & \\sqrt { \\rho_0 ^ 2 + 2 \\ ; \\tau \\ ; \\rho_0 \\ ; \\dot{\\rho}_0 - \\alpha^2 \\tau^2 } , \\vspace{0.2 cm } \\hspace{1 cm } & \\varphi & = & \\varphi_0 + \\dot{\\varphi}_0 \\ ; \\tau , \\end{array}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 for massive particles and @xmath30 for photons , where @xmath31 is the proper time and affine parameter , respectively .",
    "the symbols @xmath32 and @xmath33 stand for the values of the coordinate time , distance from the axis , axial and angular coordinates of the particle , and its radial , axial and angular velocities at @xmath34 .",
    "free massive particles and photons leaving the cylinder fall back after a finite proper time / affine parameter interval under the same angle they left the shell before . after crossing the shell ,",
    "they thus circumscribe always the same trajectory outside .",
    "an example of a typical trajectory in cylindrical coordinates is shown in . only radially moving photons escape to infinity .",
    "this can be easily seen in that uses minkowskian coordinates both inside and outside of the shell  all geodesics ( straight lines here ) that leave the shell at some point and lie within the light cone intersect the cylindrical hypersurface again . any observer outside perceives the cylinder as an infinite planar wall falling upon him at the speed @xmath10 .",
    "no matter how hard he tries , the wall always hits him .",
    "after he passes through the shell , he emerges in another section of minkowski spacetime .",
    "he realizes he is surrounded by a cylinder . using a rocket",
    ", he is able to stay in this part of the spacetime indefinitely .",
    "however , he can always penetrate the wall again and reemerge in his original universe .",
    "the metric within the flat spacetime regions above and below the disk surface reads @xmath35 using the following transformation @xmath36 we find the usual minkowski metric .",
    "an observer located above and below the disk sees it as a hypersurface defined by @xmath37 , respectively . identifying these",
    ", we find out that the disk is composed of counter rotating null particles moving on circular geodesics around the disk centre .",
    "the surface density is positive definite everywhere . any massive geodetical test particle penetrating the disk spirals down towards the centre of the disk in infinite proper time while photons are able to escape to infinity .",
    "a very detailed discussion is to be found in @xcite .",
    "the similarity between these solutions lies in the fact that a thin shell of matter separates two regions of flat spacetime and that the shell can be interpreted as free photons moving along circular orbits within the shell .",
    "one might then ask what holds the shell in place . from the point of view of the coordinate systems ( [ cylindrical metric ] ) and ( [ rindler metric ] ) , where the shell surface is static , the centrifugal force acting upon the shell particles is balanced by the gravitational force exerted upon them by the other particles on the shell . if we adopt the perspective of two minkowskian coordinate systems ( [ cylindrical metric ] ) and ( [ cylinder to rindler ] ) then , however , the outer shell surface is not static .",
    "it is , in fact , accelerated towards free particles at rest in such a system .",
    "this effect balances the centrifugal force acting on the shell .",
    "the difference between the two cases consists in the definition of the hypersurfaces that are identified in the two separate minkowski spacetimes inside and outside , and above and below , respectively .",
    "if we want to compare these hypersurfaces , we need to use a single coordinate system .",
    "we begin by describing the outer cylindrical hypersurface with a coordinate radius @xmath38 in the disk coordinates ( [ disk coordinates ] ) .",
    "we first transform the coordinate system ( [ rindler metric ] ) into the minkowskian coordinates and from here we go to ( [ disk coordinates ] ) to obtain @xmath39 this is just a planar horizontal section of the spacetime .",
    "the inner hypersurface , as defined in coordinates ( [ cylindrical metric ] ) , reads @xmath40 in this case , the cylindrical surface is again a cylinder .",
    "we identify points with @xmath41 where the minus sign refers to the inner ( lower ) hypersurface and plus to the outer ( upper ) one .",
    "the identification is not at all trivial and , moreover , it is time - dependent .    in coordinates defined by ( [ disk coordinates ] ) ,",
    "the disk surface is given by the cones @xmath42 where we identify points with @xmath43 it can be seen immediately that ( [ rindler - cylinder - inner ] ) , ( [ rindler - cylinder - outer ] ) , ( [ identification in rindler - cylinder ] ) and ( [ rindler - disk ] ) , ( [ identification in rindler - disk ] ) are not identical .",
    "we conclude that the two cases are different although constructed in an analogous way using two separate minkowskian regions .",
    "one can imagine various pairs of identification surfaces , both static and time - dependent , that produce infinitely thin shells separating regions of flat spacetime and that are composed of photons ( another example is a thin spherical shell separating two identical regions of minkowski spacetime of finite volume , see @xcite ) .",
    "there are only two conditions  the induced metric must be the same on both hypersurfaces and the trace of the induced energy - momentum tensor ( satisfying energy conditions ) needs to be zero .",
    "if we use a coordinate system in which the shell is static and which covers both the hypersurface and the neighbouring region , geodesics will lead escaping particles back towards the shell .",
    "if we , on the other hand , prefer a simpler minkowskian description , then test particles outside are not accelerated but the shell itself speeds towards them . in either case , the existence of the shells is enabled by the resulting balance .",
