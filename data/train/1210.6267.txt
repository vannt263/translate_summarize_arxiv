    "it is well - known that the application of turbo codes and lpdc codes improves the data detection process at the receiver , which in turn can be applied to improve the performance of decision - directed estimators .",
    "the improved estimation and tracking accuracy allows for more accurate compensation of impairments such as time varying phase noise at the receiver which can also improve data detection .",
    "thus , by jointly performing data detection and estimation , the performance of wireless communication systems can be significantly improved .",
