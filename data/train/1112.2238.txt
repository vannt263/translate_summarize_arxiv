    "the most studied widom line is in supercooled water where a first order liquid - liquid transition has been proposed between a high - density liquid and a low - density liquid phase  @xcite .",
    "this phase boundary has been hypothesized to end in a critical point from which the widom line emanates  @xcite .",
    "this critical point can not be directly investigated experimentally because it is usurped by the spontaneous crystallization of water .",
    "experimental searches @xcite for this critical point have involved putting water in a confined geometry to avoid spontaneous crystallization @xcite .",
    "however , so far there has been no direct experimental evidence of this critical point .",
    "therefore , studies focused on the widom line have been based on the belief that a widom line is associated with the existence of a critical point @xcite .",
    "these studies have found a rich and complex behavior .",
    "for example , along the widom line in supercooled water , experiments have found a fragile - to - strong dynamic transition  @xcite , a sharp change in the proton chemical shift which is a measure of the local order in confined water  @xcite , and a density minimum of water @xcite .",

    "this is similar to the maximum in the low frequency noise in the energy and magnetization that was found at the second order phase transition temperature of the 2d ising ferromagnetic ising model and at the first order transition of the 2d 5-state potts model @xcite .",

    "the narrow width of the intermediate region might be due to the fact that density correlations are short lived at high temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the density fluctuations , the power spectrum of the potential energy fluctuations along the widom line does not exhibit three distinct frequency regimes . finally , we found that the low frequency white noise of the density and potential energy fluctuations have their maxima along the widom line .",
    "this suggests that noise power spectra , which have been used to probe phase transitions @xcite , can also be used to locate the widom line ."

    "<S> our simulation results show that the noise power spectrum of the density fluctuations on the widom line of the liquid - vapor transition exhibits three distinct @xmath0 behaviors with exponents @xmath1= 0 , 1.2 and 2 , depending on the frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the intermediate frequency region with an exponent @xmath3 1 appears as the temperature approaches the widom temperature from above or below . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we do not find three distinct regions of @xmath0 in the power spectrum of the potential energy fluctuations on the widom line . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the power spectra of both the density and potential energy fluctuations at low frequency have a maximum on the widom line , suggesting that the noise power can provide an alternative signature of the widom line . </S>"
