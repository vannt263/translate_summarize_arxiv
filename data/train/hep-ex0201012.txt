    "the description of the hadronization process in qcd is deeply connected with the confinement property and requires non - perturbative methods .",
    "the precise measurement of momentum spectra of identified particles in the clean environment of @xmath13 annihilation into hadrons may improve the understanding of hadronization .",
    "meanwhile these measurements are necessary to test and tune the phenomenological models used to describe the hadronization : each of these models has free parameters which must be determined from comparison with data @xcite .",
    "resonant states and their dynamics are more closely related to the original partons than pions .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath0 mesons are copiously produced in hadronic events and thus well suited to a study of hadronization .    in this investigation",
    "a measurement of the inclusive momentum distributions of the @xmath4 and @xmath10 mesons obtained through their @xmath14 decays is presented , which improves on the previous aleph results @xcite with higher statistics and reduced systematic effects .",
    "it also complements the recent publication concerning the @xmath15 decay of the @xmath4 meson @xcite .",
    "studies by the opal and l3 collaborations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the partial width of leptonic decay rates of the light vector mesons is a good test both for the quark assignments ( @xmath16 with @xmath17 ) in the vector meson and the quark charges . with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the partial decay width of a vector meson v to lepton pairs ( @xmath21=e@xmath22 , @xmath23 )",
    "can be calculated using the van royen - weisskopf formula @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the square of the flavour - weighted sum of the charges @xmath26 of the quarks ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath27 is the amplitude of the @xmath28 wavefunction at the origin , and @xmath29 is the meson mass",
    ". the expected ratio of the leptonic widths is @xmath30 in agreement with the widths and branching ratios measured as summarized in @xcite for the decay to @xmath13 .",
    "while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are in agreement with the prediction based on the van royen - weisskopf formula and lepton universality also for the muonic decay , only an upper limit @xcite so far has been established for the decay @xmath33 ( table  [ tab - br ] ) .",
    "the muonic branching ratio of the @xmath34 is measured here for the first time .",
    ".widths and leptonic branching ratios of the light vector mesons v @xcite[tab - br ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the @xmath4 , the total estimated production rate of @xmath35 per event is somewhat higher than the predictions of both jetset 7.4 ( 1.00 @xmath4 per event ) and herwig 5.9 ( 1.04 @xmath4 per event ) .",
    "this result is also somewhat higher than the results published by lep experiments .",
    "the two measurements for the @xmath36 mode  @xcite and the @xmath37 mode differ by more than twice the estimated error , the ratio ( rate obtained with the @xmath14 mode to the rate obtained with the @xmath38 mode ) being @xmath39 .",
    "this is consistent with a recent finding by opal @xcite of @xmath40 for the same ratio .    for the @xmath10 , the total estimated production rate of @xmath41 per event lies significantly below the prediction of jetset 7.4 ( 1.31 @xmath10 per event ) and somewhat below that of herwig 5.9 ( 1.13 @xmath10 per event ) .",
    "published results from l3 and opal for the production rate of the @xmath10 are in good agreement with the result of this analysis .",
    "the signal @xmath43 is obtained from the invariant mass distribution of two identified muons of opposite charge originating from a common vertex ( fig .",
    "[ omumu - figsoft ] ) .",
    "the signal is taken as the number of events in the mass region @xmath44 reduced by the estimated background in the same region .",
    "monte carlo studies have shown the background to be linear as a function of the invariant mass .",
    "the level of background in the signal region is extrapolated from the background in the sidebands in the mass ranges @xmath45 and @xmath46 . applying the cuts described in sections [ evse ] and [ pid ] results in an optimal signal - to - background ratio , @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ omumu - figsoft ] shows 35 events in the signal region .",
    "a background of 16.94 events is estimated from the sidebands , leaving @xmath49 signal events . when the acceptance is taken from jetset  7.4 , but with the momentum spectrum and rate corrected to agree with the @xmath50 analysis , a muonic branching ratio br@xmath51 is obtained , based on the selected events shown in fig .",
    "[ omumu - figsoft ] .",
    "the effect of tightening cuts in order to increase @xmath52 is shown in fig .",
    "[ omumu - fighard ] . for this , the additional requirements are muon momenta greater than @xmath53 , two vdet hits instead of one , and a stronger @xmath54 event rejection ( keeping 90% of light quark - antiquark events ) . in the signal region",
    "14 events are kept , with an estimated background of 3.24 events , leaving @xmath55 signal events .",
    "uncertainties on the muonic branching ratio come from the uncertainty of the momentum spectrum of the @xmath10 and its rate in hadronic events , which are taken from the @xmath50 analysis .",
    "if the momentum spectrum from jetset  7.4 is used , the extracted branching ratio would increase .",
    "half of the difference from the shape of the spectrum is taken as systematic error ( 4% ) .",
    "further systematic errors come from the uncertainty of the measured rate of @xmath10 production per event in the @xmath56 analysis . because event selection and track selection are similar in both analyses their errors are assumed fully correlated and neglected . the remaining errors ( @xmath57 selection , fitting procedure , etc . )",
    "are studied by varying the monte carlo momentum spectrum according to these remaining errors .",
    "an error of 6% is obtained .",
    "possible uncertainties can arise from the track selection and b - tag probability .",
    "the last also changes the flavour composition of the sample ; the @xmath10 rate for different flavours has not yet been measured .",
    "the @xmath50 analysis was therefore repeated with the cuts on b - tag probability and track selection from this analysis .",
    "an error of 4% is derived .",
    "the estimation of the background is dominated by the limited statistics in the sidebands .",
    "smaller uncertainties come from a possible curvature of the background shape , e.g. , due to the @xmath58 meson .",
    "the error is determined to be 6% .",
    "further systematic uncertainties are related to the performance of the aleph detector @xcite : muon identification @xcite ( @xmath59 ) , tracking resolution , which influences the signal shape ( @xmath59 ) , and the missing energy , the impact of which is found to be negligible .",
    "the limited monte carlo statistics adds 3% to the error .",
    "other sources of systematic error such as background are found to be small and are neglected .",
    "the total systematic error is obtained by adding the contributions in quadrature , giving @xmath60 .",
    "the muonic branching ratio is measured to be br@xmath61 from the observation of @xmath49 signal events .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectation from the flavour composition of the vector mesons and from lepton universality .",
    "the inclusive production of the @xmath4 meson and the @xmath10 vector meson in hadronic z decays has been studied and compared to model predictions .",

    "decays of the type @xmath63 are reconstructed for the momentum interval of @xmath64 .",
    "a signal is seen in the muonic decay @xmath43 .",
    "the average @xmath4 rate per event for @xmath65 is measured to be @xmath6 ; an extrapolation to @xmath66 using the shape of the fragmentation function in jetset 7.4 yields a total production rate of @xmath67 per event .",
    "the predictions of both jetset 7.4 ( 1.00 @xmath4 per event ) and herwig 5.9 ( 1.04 @xmath4 per event ) are somewhat below this result .",
    "the use of the matrix elements proposed by @xcite and @xcite resulted in a significant effect on the momentum spectrum for low @xmath4 momenta .",
    "the matrix element is not present in jetset 7.4 and herwig 5.9 .",

    "the average @xmath10 rate per event for @xmath68 is measured to be @xmath3 ; an extrapolation to @xmath66 yields a total production rate of @xmath69 per event .",
    "the rate lies significantly below the prediction of jetset 7.4 ( 1.31 @xmath10 per event ) and somewhat below that of herwig 5.9 ( 1.13 @xmath10 per event )",
    ". published results from l3 and opal for the production rate of the @xmath10 are in good agreement with the result of this analysis .",
