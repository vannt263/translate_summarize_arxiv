    "the cepheus flare region is a collection of star - forming molecular clouds extending to @xmath1 degrees above the galactic plane at a galactic longitude of @xmath2 degrees @xcite .",
    "star formation is occurring at several different distances along the line of sight toward the cepheus flare : at @xmath3pc , where star formation is associated with the edge of the local bubble ; at @xmath4pc , associated with the gould belt ; and at @xmath5pc , associated with the perseus arm of the galaxy ( @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite , hereafter k09 ) .",
    "the gould belt is a ring of molecular clouds and ob associations @xmath6kpc in diameter and inclined @xmath7 to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the gould belt is considered a ` laboratory ' for the study of low - mass star formation , as most of the low - mass star forming regions within 500pc of the earth are associated with it . as a result , surveys aimed at mapping substantial fractions of the gould belt have been undertaken using the jcmt @xcite , the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite , and the _ spitzer _ space telecope @xcite .    in this paper , we present scuba-2 observations of the intermediate - distance material in cepheus associated with the gould belt . these data were taken as part of the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) gould belt legacy survey ( gbls ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are five dark cloud complexes in the cepheus flare which are associated with the gould belt : l1147/48/52/55/57/58 , l1172/74 , l1247/51 , l1228 and l1241 @xcite .",
    "we present scuba-2 data for all or part of each of these regions , with the exception of l1241 .",
    "the cepheus flare is a sparsely - filled region in which star formation appears to be proceeding in a variety of different environments .",
    "iras 100  observations of the cepheus flare @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : ceph_finding_chart ] , with contours of @xmath8 extinction overlaid @xcite .",
    "the regions of highest visual extinction are not distributed evenly across the cepheus flare , but instead are principally located on its north - eastern and south - western sides .",
    "in addition , cepheus has a central region of relatively low extinction ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) in which little star formation is occurring , although there is not a complete lack of molecular gas or young stars here @xcite .",
    "k09 found that ysos in the cepheus flare are typically found in small , isolated groups , with a much higher fraction of distributed ysos ( the fraction of ysos not associated with a group ) than is typical : 41% of ysos in cepheus are distributed , compared to an average of @xmath10% across clouds observed as part of the spitzer c2d survey @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it must be stressed that the values shown for the virial ratio @xmath11 are upper limits ( for the assumed bounding density ) ; figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] shows the greatest extent to which our cores could be virially bound .",
    "figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] suggests that in the high - bounding - density case , our cores are not thermally supported : in the absence of non - thermal internal energy and/or an internal magnetic field , @xmath12 in all but one case ( core 19 , which is marginally unbound ) . if the cores dominant support mechanism were internal _",
    "thermal _ motions , then all but two of our cores ( core 19 , and core 3 , discussed below ) would be simultaneously undergoing pressure - driven collapse .",
    "the physical picture in the low - bounding - density case , is less clear than in the high - density case . in this case , the cores are less strongly bound and less pressure - confined than in the high - density case .",
    "figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] shows that our cores remain typically virially bound and pressure - confined in the low - bounding - density - case , but that a significant fraction of the cores are in or near virial equlibrium , particularly those in l1147/58 , l1174 and l1228 .",
    "many of the cores in l1147/58 are marginally unbound in this analysis , along with four cores in l1174 and one core in l1228 .",
    "all of the cores in l1251 and l1172 remain virially bound . in this case , there are seven gravitationally- and virially - bound cores in the sample , and one core which is gravitationally - dominated but marginally virially unbound .    in either case",
    ", these results suggest that a significant fraction of our cores are simultaneously undergoing pressure - driven collapse .",
    "as this scenario is unlikely , we hypothesise three possible alternative scenarios :    \\(1 ) the y97 measurements overestimate the external pressure on our cores . if the low - resolution , and hence large - scale , y97 @xmath0co measurements do not correspond accurately to the gas immediately surrounding our dense cores , the linewidths measured by y97 will not accurately represent the pressure confining the core . as turbulent motions are expected to dissipate on small scales ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , velocities measured with the y97 beam size of 2.4 arcmin ( corresponding to 12pc at a distance of 300pc ) may not be representative of the velocities of material surrounding the sub - parsec - scale cores we consider here .",
    "\\(2 ) the non - thermal motions of the gas surrounding the core do not create the effect of a hydrostatic pressure on the core , or do not do so in such a manner that the measured linewidth accurately represents the pressure on the core caused by non - thermal gas motions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the dominant mechanism of core support in cepheus has not been accounted for in our virial analysis . in this scenario , cores are predominantly supported by some combination of internal non - thermal motions and/or internal magnetic field .",
    "@xcite found that the majority of the starless cores in the highest - column - density regions of the ophiuchus molecular cloud were typically in approximate virial equilibrium with their surroundings , and marginally pressure - dominated , with the majority of support against collapse provided by non - thermal internal motions .",
    "figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] is consistent with starless cores in cepheus behaving in a similar way to those in ophiuchus , presuming that there is sufficient internal support from non - thermal internal motions and/or internal magnetic fields to bring the cores into approximate virial equilibrium with their surroundings .",
    "none of these hypotheses are contradictory , and all may contribute to the apparent over - estimation of the degree to which our cores are pressure - confined .",
    "values of the virial ratio are marked as upper limits on figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] , as we can identify the information missing from our determination of the cores virial ratios : an estimate of the cores non - thermal and magnetic internal energies .",
    "if either hypotheses ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) above are valid , then the values of the confinement ratio @xmath13 shown on figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] are lower limits on the true values . however , we do not mark them as such on figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] , as we do not know which of our hypotheses best explain the measured values of external pressure .",
    "the high - density analysis suggests that there is one gravitationally - bound prestellar core amongst our sample : core 3 in l1147/58 , for which @xmath14 and @xmath12 .",
    "this core is among the 13 cores predicted to be gravitationally unstable by the bonnor - ebert criterion .",
    "it is worth noting that the majority of the cores which are only mildly pressure - dominated are unstable according to the bonnor - ebert criterion .",
    "if the measured values of the confinement ratio are in fact lower limits on the true values , many of these cores may be prove to be gravitationally bound .",
    "the low - density analysis suggests that there are seven gravitationally - bound prestellar cores amongst our sample , all of which are unstable according to the bonnor - ebert criterion .",
    "three of the cores which are mildly pressure - dominated are unstable according to the bonnor - ebert criterion .",
    "the bonnor - ebert stability criterion is in better agreement with our virial analysis in the low - density case than in the high - density case .",
    "if the bonnor - ebert criterion is in fact an accurate measure of the stability of our cores , it suggests that the low - density model ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) is a more accurate description of the energy balance of our cores than the high - density model .    that the low - density model is more likely to be accurate is also supported by the values of the virial ratio shown in figure  [ fig : ceph_virial ] : in the low - density case , a significant fraction of the cores have virial ratios consistent with their being in or near virial equilibrium with their surroundings , as might be expected in reasonably long - lived star - forming regions ( all of the cepheus clouds have been forming stars for long enough to form at least some class ii protostars ; see k09 ) .    in the high - density case ,",
    "almost all of the cores appear to be strongly pressure - confined and virially bound , suggesting that they are all effectively imploding under pressure - an unlikely situation for cores in star - forming regions that appear to have been forming stars continuously for a significant length of time , particularly those showing no signs of recent external influence .",
    "hence , we conclude that of our two models , a density of @xmath17@xmath16 is the more likely to be representative of the true density at which our cores are confined by pressure from the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "the minimum additional information which is required in order to determine which of our cores are in fact virially bound is a measure of the cores internal linewidths , i.e. observations of the cores in an optically thin dense gas tracer such as c@xmath18o or nitrogen - bearing tracers ( e.g. nh@xmath19 , n@xmath20h@xmath21 ) .",
    "this would allow determination of the level of core support from non - thermal internal motions .",
    "ideally , a measure of the magnetic field strength in the cores is also required , to determine whether magnetic fields play a significant rle in core support in cepheus .",
    "this might be achieved using a wide - field polarimeter such as pol-2 on the jcmt ( @xcite ; ward - thompson et al .",
    "2016 , in prep . ) .",
    "our estimates of the external surface pressure on the cores could be improved with higher - resolution observations of the cepheus flare clouds in medium - density tracers such as @xmath0co .",
    "measurements of the linewidth of gas surrounding the cores taken with an instrument with angular resolution comparable to the angular size of the cores ( e.g. using harp - b on the jcmt ; @xcite ) would allow us to exclude hypothesis ( 1 ) , above .",
    "in this paper we have extracted sources from the scuba-2 data of the l1147/l1158 , l1172/l1174 , l1251 and l1228 regions of the cepheus flare .",
    "we have characterised our sources using their 850-  flux densities and temperatures supplied by the _",
    "_ gbs ( di francesco et al . , 2016 , in prep . ) .",
    "we have compared the properties of cores in the different cepheus flare regions in order to determine the mode of star formation proceeding in each region .",
    "we have determined the relative importance of gravity and external pressure in confining our cores , and have determined an upper limit on the degree to which our cores are virially bound .",
    "we identified 117 sources across the cepheus flare region using the csar source extraction algorithm , of which 23 were associated with a protostar in the k09 spitzer catalogue .",
    "of our 117 sources , 20 were located in l1147/l1158 , 26 in l1174 , 9 sources in l1172 , 42 in l1251 and 20 in l1228 .",
    "we determined the best - fit flux densities of our sources using the multiple - gaussian fitting algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "we determined masses for each of our sources using our best - fit flux densities and temperatures supplied by the _",
    "_ gbs ( di francesco et al . , 2016 , in prep . ) .",
    "we found that our cores typically lie in the ` prestellar ' part of the mass / size plane .",
    "our cores typically have temperatures in the range @xmath22k , with the exception of cores associated with the l1174 reflection nebula , which have temperatures up to @xmath23k .",
    "we determined source temperatures from the ratio of scuba-2 450-  and 850-  flux densities , for those of our sources with a detection @xmath24 at 450 .",
    "we found that temperatures determined from _ herschel _ and scuba-2 data were generally in agreement for our sources .",
    "we found a slight tendency for _ herschel_-derived temperatures to be higher than scuba-2-derived temperatures , consistent with _",
    "observations sampling slightly warmer material .",
    "source masses derived from scuba-2 temperatures are correspondingly slightly higher than those derived from _",
    "herschel _ temperatures .",
    "we concluded that the scuba-2 flux density ratio is a reliable determinant of a source s temperature when neither the 450-  nor the 850-  data point is on the rayleigh - jeans tail of a source s spectral energy distribution ",
    "i.e. when @xmath25k .",
    "we analysed the cumulative distribution functions of core masses for each region in cepheus , using the maximum likelihood estimator for an infinite power - law distribution , and found that the core mass function in each region shows a sub - salpeter power - law behaviour , with the exception of l1228 , which has a power - law index consistent with the salpeter imf .",
    "determining the power - law index over all cores , we found a sub - salpeter value of @xmath26 over the mass range @xmath27m@xmath28 .",
    "for the highest - mass cores , we found a cmf power - law index @xmath29 over the mass range @xmath30m@xmath28 ( again determined over all cores ) , marginally consistent with the salpeter imf .",
    "we compared the number of starless cores detected in each region with the numbers of embedded and class ii sources found by k09 .",
    "we found that l1147/l1158 and l1228 have a high ratio of starless cores to class ii sources , while l1251 and l1174 have a low ratio .",
    "this is consistent with l1174 and l1251 being active sites of star formation , while l1147/l1158 and l1228 form stars in a less active mode .",
    "we determined the bonnor - ebert critically - stable masses of our cores , and found that the bonnor - ebert model predicts that most of our cores have stable be solutions accessible to them .",
    "we performed a virial analysis on our cores , determining the external pressure on our cores using @xmath0co velocity dispersion measurements determined by @xcite .",
    "we found that , assuming a bounding density for our cores of @xmath31@xmath16 , all but one of our cores are virially bound and there is only one gravitationally - bound prestellar core among our sample , with the rest of the cores being confined by external pressure .",
    "however , we found that if we assume a bounding density of @xmath32@xmath16 , seven of our cores are gravitationally bound , and the majority of the cores are approximately virialised or mildly pressure - confined .",
    "we concluded that , if the @xcite measurements are representative of the conditions in the gas confining our cores , our cores typically can not be supported by internal _ thermal _ energy alone . in the absence of non - thermal internal motions or an internal magnetic field , a significant fraction of our cores would be significantly out of virial equilibrium and collapsing under pressure .",
    "we hence hypothesise that cores in the cepheus molecular cloud may not typically be thermally supported .",
