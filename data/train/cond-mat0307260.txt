    "the hope to use molecules as the ultimate building blocks of electronic circuits motivates the quest to understand electronic transport in thinner and thinner wires , ideally with one or two conduction modes .",
    "however a number of physical phenomena tend to drive such one - dimensional ( 1d ) metallic wires to an insulating state at low temperature .",
    "the most basic is the great sensitivity of 1d transport to disorder : a 1d wire has a localization length of the order of its elastic mean free path .",
    "it has also been shown that most molecular 1d conductors undergo a structural peirls transition to an insulating state at low temperature @xcite .",
    "finally the repulsive coulomb interactions between electrons , which are very weakly screened in 1d , tend to destabilize the 1d fermi liquid in flavor of correlated states which are also insulating at low temperature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that carbon nanotubes , because of their special band structure , escape such a fate and remain conducting over lengths greater than one micron down to very low temperature .",
    "they do not present any detectable peirls distortion and are weakly sensitive to disorder .",
    "moreover transport through the nanotubes is quantum coherent , as demonstrated by the existence of strong supercurrents when connected to superconducting contacts .",
    "the observation of intrinsic superconductivity in ropes containing a few tens of tubes is even more surprising and indicates the presence of attractive pairing interactions which overcome the strong repulsive interactions .",
    "single walled carbon nanotubes are constituted by a single graphene plane wrapped into a cylinder .",
    "the fermi surface of graphene is very particular , it is reduced to six discrete points at the corners of the first brillouin zone @xcite . as a result , depending on their diameter and their helicity which determine the boundary conditions of the electronic wave functions around the tube , swnt can be either semiconducting or metallic @xcite . when metallic they have just two conducting channels , only very weakly coupled by electron - electron interactions .",
    "they are thus characterized by a low electronic density together with a high fermi velocity ( nearly as high as in copper ) and relatively large mean free paths @xcite .",
    "these properties make them much sought - after realizations of 1d conductors , or more precisely of 1d ladders with very small transverse coupling @xcite . at 1d ,",
    "electron - electron interactions lead to an exotic correlated electronic state , the luttinger liquid ( ll)@xcite where collective low energy plasmon - like excitations give rise to anomalies in the single particle density of states , and where no long range order exists at finite temperature .",
    "proof of the validity of ll description with repulsive interactions in swnt was given by the measurement of a resistance diverging as a power law with temperature down to 10 k @xcite with an exponent depending on whether contacts are taken on the end or in the bulk of the tube . from these exponents the ll parameter @xmath2 measuring the strength of the interactions",
    "was deduced to be @xmath3 .",
    "this value which is much smaller than @xmath4 corresponds to dominant repulsive interactions .",
    "the extrapolation of this power law behavior down to very low temperature would indicate an insulating state .",
    "however , these measurements were done on nanotubes connected to the measuring leads through tunnel junctions . because of coulomb blockade @xcite , the low temperature and voltage transport regime could not be explored .",
    "we have developed a technique ( described in section ii ) in which measuring pads are connected through low resistance contact to suspended nanotubes @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to obtain individual tubes with a resistance at room temperature ( rt ) no larger than @xmath5 , that increases only slightly at low temperatures ( typically a @xmath6 resistance increase between rt and 1 k ) ( section iii ) .",
    "the resistance versus voltage ( @xmath7 ) curves also exhibit weak logarithmic non - linearities at low temperature .",
    "however we find no simple scaling law between the voltage and the temperature - dependence of the differential resistance .",
    "this suggests that several different physical mechanisms could contribute to the very low temperature dependence of the resistance .",
    "in section iv we show that when the contact pads are superconducting , a supercurrent can flow through swnts as well as through ropes of swnts @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate in principle that quantum coherent transport can take place through carbon nanotubes over micron - long scales .",
    "however the unexpectedly high measured values of the critical current in individual nanotubes , along with non - linearities in the @xmath8 characteristics at voltages much higher than the superconducting gap of the contacts raise the question of possible intrinsic superconductivity .    finally in section",
    "v we present measurements on long ropes of swnts connected to normal contacts which indeed show evidence of intrinsic superconductivity below 0.5 k provided that the distance between normal electrodes is large enough .",
    "we discuss the one - dimensional character of the transition and the physical parameters which govern this transition , such as the presence of normal reservoirs , intertube coupling and disorder .",
    "the swnt are prepared by an electrical arc method with a mixture of nickel and yttrium as a catalyst  @xcite .",
    "swnt with diameters of the order of 1.4 nm are obtained .",
    "they are purified by the cross - flow filtration method  @xcite .",
    "the tubes usually come assembled in ropes of a few hundred tubes in parallel , but individual tubes can also be obtained after chemical treatment with a surfactant  @xcite .",
    "connection of an individual tube or rope to measuring pads is performed according to the following nano - soldering technique : a target covered with nanotubes is placed above a metal - coated suspended @xmath9 membrane , in which a 0.3   @xmath10 by 100   @xmath10 slit has been etched with a focused ion beam . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use a 10 ns - long pulse of a focused uv laser beam ( power 10 kw ) to detach a nanotube from the target , which then falls and connects the edges of the slit below .",
    "since the metal electrodes on each side of the slit are locally molten , the tube gets soldered into good contacts , and is suspended ( see fig.[temtube ] ) .",
    "the electrodes are usually bilayers ( re / au , ta / au , ta / sn ) or trilayers ( al@xmath11o@xmath12/pt / au ) of non - miscible materials ( in liquid or solid phases ) , in which the lower layer ( re , ta ) has a high melting temperature in order to protect the nitride membrane during the welding of the tube to the top gold layer .",
    "gold was mostly chosen as the solder material because it neither reacts with carbon nor oxidizes .",
    "the contact region is pictured in the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) view of fig.[temtube ] .",
    "balls of metal molten by the laser pulse can be seen on the edges of the slit .",

    "[ figurerth ] this critical field decreases linearly with temperature , very similar to what is seen in swnt and ropes connected to superconducting contacts .",

    "note the linear behavior.[figuredivh],width=340 ]    before analyzing the data further we wish to emphasize that this is the first observation of superconductivity in wires having less than one hundred conduction channels .",
    "earlier experiments in nanowires @xcite dealt with at least a few thousand channels .",
    "we therefore expect a strong 1d behavior for the transition .",
    "in particular , the broadness of the resistance drop with temperature is due to large fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter in reduced dimension starting at the 3d transition temperature @xmath21 . in the following",
    "we will try to explain the variety of behaviors observed taking into account several essential features : the large normal contacts , together with the finite length of the samples compared to relevant mesoscopic and superconducting scales , the number of tubes within a rope , the amount of disorder and intertube coupling .",
    "we first assume that all ropes are diffusive conductors but we will see that this hypothesis is probably not valid in the more ordered ropes .",
    "we first recall that the resistance of any superconducting wire measured through normal contacts ( an nsn junction ) can not be zero : a metallic swnt , with 2 conducting channels , has a contact resistance of half the resistance quantum , @xmath37 ( where @xmath38=12.9 k@xmath1 ) , even if it is superconducting .",
    "a rope of @xmath39 parallel metallic swnt will have a minimum resistance of @xmath40 .",
    "therefore we use the residual resistance @xmath41 to deduce a lower bound for the number of metallic tubes in the rope @xmath42 . from the residual resistances of @xmath43 in sample @xmath27 , and less than @xmath44 in @xmath26 we deduce that there are at least @xmath45 metallic tubes in @xmath27 and @xmath46 in @xmath26 . in both cases that means that a large fraction of tubes participate to transport and justifies a posteriori the hypothesis that ropes are diffusive conductors . in the other samples we can not estimate the number of conducting tubes because we do not reach the regime where the resistance saturates to its lowest value .      assuming that the bcs relation holds we get for the superconducting gap @xmath47 @xmath48 : @xmath49  @xmath50 for @xmath27 .",
    "we can then deduce the superconducting coherence length along the rope in the diffusive limit : @xmath51 this expression yields @xmath52  @xmath53 m where @xmath54 is the longitudinal fermi velocity @xmath55 m / s.(consistent with 1d superconductivity , @xmath56 is ten times larger than the diameter of the rope ) .",
    "we now estimate the superconducting coherence length of the other samples , to explain the extent or absence of observed transition .",
    "indeed , investigation of the proximity effect at high - transparency ns interfaces has shown that superconductivity resists the presence of normal contacts only if the length of the superconductor is much greater than @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this condition is nearly fulfilled in @xmath27 ( @xmath58 ) . using the high temperature resistance values and assuming a gap equal to that of @xmath27 we find @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "these values explain qualitatively the reduced transition temperature of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the absence of a transition for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "moreover we can argue that the superconducting transitions we see are not due to a hidden proximity effect : if the @xmath63 contacts were made superconducting by the laser pulse , the shortest ropes ( 3 and 6 ) would become superconducting at temperatures higher than the longer ones ( 1 , 2 , 4 ) .",
    "it is however not possible to explain the behavior of the sample 5 with the same kind of argument , since the same expression yields a coherence length @xmath64 much shorter than the length of the sample , and nonetheless no complete transition is seen .",
    "we believe that this is due to the strong disorder in this sample which is very close to the localization limit .",
    "fig.[figurerth ] shows that the transition even disappeared after thermal cycling when an increase of room temperature resistance led to complete localization at low temperature .",
    "another a priori important parameter is the number of tubes in a rope : the less tubes in a rope , the closer the system is to the strictly 1d limit , and the weaker the transition .",
    "if we compare the two ropes in fig .",
    "[ pt24 ] , it is clear that the transition both in temperature and magnetic field is much broader in the rope @xmath26 with only 40 tubes than in the rope @xmath27 with 350 tubes .",
    "moreover there is no inflexion point in the temperature dependence of the resistance in the thinner rope , typical of a strictly 1d behavior .",
    "we also expect a stronger screening of e - e interactions in a thick rope compared to a thin one , which could also favor superconductivity as we will discuss below .",
    "resistance as a function of temperature ( continuous line ) and magnetic field ( scatter points ) for samples @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "insets : tem micrographs of the samples.,width=302 ]      as is clear from expression ( [ xi ] ) for the superconducting coherence length , disorder is at the origin of a reduction of the superconducting coherence length in a diffusive sample compared to a ballistic one and can in this way also decrease the destructive influence of the normal contacts . more subtle and specific to the physics of ropes , we have seen that disorder also enhances the intertube coupling , so it can increase the dimensionality of the superconducting transition : weakly disordered ropes like r1 and r4 will be more 1d -like than the more disordered rope r2 . of course disorder",
    "must always be sufficiently small so as not to induce localization .",
    "these considerations may explain the variety of behaviors observed and depicted in fig.[scalert ] .",
    "resistance as a function of temperature for all samples which undergo a transition , plotted in reduced units @xmath65 and @xmath66.,width=302 ]    finally , disorder is also the essential ingredient which reveals the difference between the normal state and the superconducting state . in a ballistic rope",
    "we would not expect to observe a variation of the resistance over the superconducting transition because in both cases the resistance of the rope is just the contact resistance .    to gain insight in the transport regime , we have performed shot noise measurements of the ropes @xmath67 , in the normal state ( higher level of 1/f noise in the more resistive ropes @xmath68 made the analysis of shot noise impossible in those samples ) , between 1 and 15 k. we found a surprisingly strong reduction of the shot noise , by more than a factor 100 , which is still not well understood , but would indicate that all the tubes in these ropes are either completely ballistic or completely localized @xcite , in strong apparent contradiction with the observation of the superconducting transition of @xmath26 , with a @xmath69 resistance drop .",
    "it would however be possible to explain a resistance decrease in ballistic ropes turning superconducting , if the number of conducting channels is larger for cooper pairs than for individual electrons . in his recent theoretical investigation of superconductivity in ropes of swnt",
    ", gonzalez @xcite has shown the existence of a finite intertube transfer for cooper pairs , even between two tubes of different helicities which have no possibility of single electron intertube transfer .",
    "this cooper pair delocalization could lead to the opening of new channels when a rope containing a mixture of insulating and ballistic tubes becomes superconducting .",
    "a resistance of @xmath27 plotted on a log scale as a function of the inverse temperature at h=0 .",
    "we have subtracted the low temperature residual resistance ( contact resistance ) .",
    "the slope yields an approximate activation energy of 0.8 k which has to be compared to the condensation energy @xmath70 of cooper pairs in a sample of length @xmath57 @xmath71 .",
    "note that this characteristic energy is much smaller in our samples containing only one hundred channels than in whiskers where phase slips can only be observed very close to @xmath13 .",
    "b- v(i ) and @xmath72 curves showing the hysteretic behavior in v(i ) at each peak in the @xmath72 curve for sample @xmath27,width=340 ]      reminiscent of measurements of narrow superconducting metal wires @xcite , we find jumps in the differential resistance as the current is increased ( fig .",
    "[ pslips ] ) . for sample 2",
    "the differential resistance at low currents remains equal to @xmath41 up to 50 na , where it strongly rises but does not recover its normal state value until 2.5 @xmath53a .",
    "the jump in resistance at the first step corresponds approximately to the normal state resistance of a length @xmath56 of sample 2 .",
    "each peak corresponds to a hysteretic feature in the @xmath73 curve ( fig .",
    "[ pslips]b ) .",
    "these jumps are identified as phase slips @xcite , which are the occurrence of normal regions located around defects in the sample .",
    "such phase slips can be thermally activated ( taps ) , leading to a roughly exponential decrease of the resistance instead of a sharp transition , in qualitative agreement with our experimental observation ( fig .",
    "[ pslips]a ) . at sufficiently low temperature ,",
    "taps are expected to be replaced by quantum phase slips , which , when tunneling through the sample , contribute an additional resistance to the zero temperature resistance .",
    "also , in sample 2 the current at which the first resistance jump occurs ( 60 na , see fig . [ figuredivh ] ) is close to the theoretical critical current of a diffusive superconducting wire @xcite with gap @xmath74 ( @xmath7520 na ) , whereas the current at which the last resistance jump occurs ( 2.4 @xmath76a , see fig .",
    "[ figuredivt ] ) is close to the theoretical critical current of a ballistic superconducting wire with the same number of conducting channels @xmath77@xmath78 @xmath76a @xcite .",
    "we also expect this current @xmath77@xmath79 to be the critical current of a structure with this same wire placed between superconducting contacts with gap @xmath80 even if @xmath81 ) , and can thus be much larger than the ambegaokar - baratoff prediction @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "intrinsic superconductivity might thus explain the anomalously large supercurrent measured in the experiments described in the previous section , where nanotubes are connected to superconducting contacts .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the low temperature quadratic dependence of the critical currents which is very similar in all samples both on normal and superconducting contacts .",
    "it is difficult to say a priori what causes the disappearance of superconductivity in carbon nanotubes .",
    "the value of @xmath83 should be compared to the depairing field in a confined geometry @xcite , and corresponds to a flux quantum @xmath84 through a length @xmath57 of an individual swnt of diameter _",
    ", @xmath85 t. but @xmath86 is also close to the field @xmath87 t at which a paramagnetic state becomes more favorable than the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "note that this value is of the same order as the critical field that was measured on swnt connected between superconducting contacts , i.e. much higher than the critical field of the contacts .",
    "the linear dependence of the critical current with magnetic field observed in all samples is very similar to the data presented in the previous section on swnt on superconducting contacts and appears strongly related to the linear dependence in @xmath17 .",
    "this linear scaling with magnetic field is surprising since it is not expected to take place in a 1d system and is more typical of 2d superconductivity @xcite . a depairing mechanism based on spin splitting of the quasiparticle energy states could however provide a possible explanation .",
    "experiments performed with various field directions compared to the tube are thus necessary for a better understanding of the influence of magnetic field on superconductivity in carbon nanotubes .",
    "data depicted in the previous section show the existence of intrinsic superconductivity in ropes of carbon nanotubes which number of tubes varies between 30 and 400 .",
    "the question of the existence of superconducting correlations in the limit of the individual tube can not be answered yet .",
    "it is of course tempting to consider the high supercurrent measured on superconducting contacts as a strong indication that superconducting fluctuations are present also in individual carbon nanotubes .",
    "however since unscreened coulomb repulsive interactions in these samples are expected to suppress superconductivity , precise investigations of individual carbon nanotubes on normal contacts are necessary .",
    "it is essential to conduct experiments on sufficiently long samples ( like the ropes presently studied ) so that intrinsic superconductivity is not destroyed by the normal contacts .",
    "note that recent magnetization experiments @xcite also strongly support the existence of superconducting fluctuations below 10 k in very small diameter ( 0.4 nm ) individual tubes grown in zeolites .",
    "we now discuss what could be the relevant mechanism for superconductivity in carbon nanotubes .",
    "observation of superconductivity in carbon based compounds was reported a long time ago .",
    "first in graphite intercalated with alkali atoms ( cs , k ) , superconducting transitions were observed between 0.2 and 0.5 k @xcite .",
    "much higher temperatures were observed in alkali - doped fullerenes @xcite because of the coupling to higher energy phonons . in all these experiments it was essential to chemically dope the system to observe superconductivity .",
    "there is no such chemical dopants in the ropes of carbon nanotubes studied here . as shown in previous works",
    "there is some possibility of hole doping of the tubes by the gold metallic contacts which electronic work function is larger than in the tubes @xcite .",
    "however , although this doping could slightly depopulate the highest occupied energy band in a semiconducting tube it is very unlikely that it is strong enough to depopulate other lower energy subbands for a metallic tube with a diameter in the nm range .",
    "more interesting would be a mechanism related to the 1d electronic structure of carbon nanotubes .",
    "a purely electronic coupling mechanism has been indeed shown to induce superconducting fluctuations in coupled double chain systems such as ladders @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this mechanism has been considered also in carbon nanotubes away from half filling but the very small order of magnitude for the energy scale of these superconducting fluctuations is not compatible with our findings @xcite .",
    "recent estimations of the electron phonon coupling coupling constants @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in carbon nanotubes seem to be more promising .",
    "it is shown that the breathing modes specific to carbon nanotubes can be at the origin of a strong electron phonon coupling giving rise to attractive interactions which can possibly overcome repulsive interactions in very small diameter tubes .",
    "the possible coupling of these rather high energy modes to low energy compression modes in the nanotube have been also considered , following the wenzel bardeen singularity scheme initially propose by loss and martin where low energy phonons are shown to turn repulsive interactions in a luttinger liquid into attractive ones and drive the system towards a superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "the suspended character of the samples may be essential in this mechanism .",
