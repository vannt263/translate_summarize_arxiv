    "major cellular activities are effectively governed by multiple protein - dna interactions @xcite .",
    "the starting point of these interactions is a process of protein searching and recognizing for the specific binding sites on dna .",
    "this is a critically important step because it allows a genetic information contained in dna to be effectively transferred by initiating various biological processes @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the fundamental processes associated with the protein search for targets on dna have been studied extensively using a wide variety of experimental and theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "although a significant progress in our understanding of the protein search phenomena has been achieved , the full description of the mechanisms remains a controversial and highly - debated research topic @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations of the protein search phenomena revealed that many proteins find their targets on dna very fast , and the corresponding association rates might exceed the estimates from 3d diffusion limits @xcite .",
    "these surprising phenomena are known as a _ facilitated diffusion _ in the protein search field .",
    "more recent single - molecule experiments , which can directly visualize the dynamics of individual molecules , also suggest that during the search proteins move not only through the bulk solution via 3d diffusion but they also bind _ non - specifically _ to dna where they hop in 1d fashion @xcite . several theoretical approaches that incorporate the coupling between 3d diffusion and 1d sliding in the protein search have been proposed @xcite , but they had a variable success in explaining all experimental observations .",
    "one of the most interesting problems related to the protein search on dna is the effect of multiple targets .",
    "the question is how long will it take for the proteins to find _ any _ specific binding site from several targets present on dna .",
    "naively , one could argue that in this case the search time should be accelerated proportionally to the number of targets , i.e. , the association reaction rate should be proportional to the concentration of specific binding sites .",
    "however , this effectively mean - field view ignores several important observations .",
    "first , it is clear that the search time for several targets lying very close to each other generally should not be the same as the search time for the same number of targets which are spatially dispersed .",
    "second , the experimentally supported complex 3d+1d search mechanism suggests that varying spatial distributions of the specific binding sites should also affect the search dynamics .",
    "thus , it seems that the simple mean - field arguments should not be valid for all conditions .",
    "surprisingly , this very important problem was addressed only in one recent work @xcite .",
    "hammar et al .",
    "@xcite using high - quality single - molecule measurements in the living cells investigated the dynamics of finding the specific sites for _ lac _ repressor proteins on dna with two targets .",
    "it was found that the association rates increase as a function of the distance between targets @xcite .",
    "an approximate theoretical model for the protein search with two targets was proposed",
    ". however , this theoretical approach has several problems .",
    "it was presented for infinitely long dna chains using a continuum approximation . at the same time , it was shown recently that the continuum approach might lead to serious errors and artifacts in the description of protein search dynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition , this theory predicted that the acceleration due to the presence of two targets in comparison with the case of only one target should disappear in the limit of very large sliding lengths .",
    "this is clearly a nonphysical result . in this limit",
    ", the protein spends most of the searching time on dna and it is faster to find any of two targets than one specific binding site .    in this article ,",
    "we present a comprehensive theoretical method of analyzing the role of multiple targets in the protein search on dna . our approach is based on a discrete - state stochastic framework that was recently developed by one of us for the search with one specific binding site @xcite .",
    "it takes into account most relevant biochemical and biophysical processes , and it allows us to obtain fully analytical solutions for all dynamic properties at all conditions .",
    "one of the main results of the discrete - state stochastic method was a construction of dynamic phase diagram @xcite .",
    "three possible dynamic search regimes were identified .",
    "when the protein sliding length was larger than the dna chain length , the search followed simple random - walk dynamics with a quadratic scaling of the search time on the dna length . for the sliding length smaller than the dna length but larger than the the size of the specific binding site , the search dynamic followed a linear scaling",
    "when the sliding length was smaller than the target size , the search was dominated by nonspecific bindings and unbindings without the sliding along dna . in this paper , we extend this method to the case of several specific binding sites at arbitrary spatial positions .",
    "it allows us to explicitly describe the role of multiple targets and their spatial distributions in the protein search .",
    "our theoretical calculations agree with available experimental observations , and we also test them in monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "the original discrete - state stochastic approach can be generalized for any number of the specific binding sites at arbitrary positions along the dna chain . but",
    "to explain the main features of our theoretical method , we analyze specifically a simpler model with only two targets as shown in fig .",
    "1 . a single dna molecule with @xmath0 binding sites and a single protein molecule are considered .",
    "the analysis can be easily extended for any concentration of proteins and dna @xcite .",
    "two of the bindings sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are targets for the protein search ( see fig .",
    "the protein starts from the bulk solution that we label as a state @xmath5 . since 3d diffusion",
    "is usually much faster than other processes in the system , we assume that the protein can access with equal probability any site on the dna chain ( with the corresponding total binding rate @xmath6 ) . while being on dna , the protein can move with a diffusion rate @xmath7 along the chain with equal probability in both directions .",
    "the protein molecule can also dissociate from dna with a rate @xmath8 to the bulk solution ( fig .",
    "the search process ends when the protein reaches for the first time _ any _ of two targets .",
    "the main idea of our approach is to utilize first - passage processes to describe the complex dynamics of the protein search on dna @xcite .",
    "one can introduce a function @xmath9 defined as a probability to reach any target at time @xmath10 for the first time if initially ( at @xmath11 ) the protein molecule starts at the state @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these first - passage probabilities evolve with time as described by a set of the backward master equations @xcite , @xmath14+k_{off } f_0(t)-(2u+k_{off } ) f_n(t),\\ ] ] for @xmath15 . at dna ends ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) the dynamics is slightly different , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in addition , in the bulk solution we have @xmath20 furthermore , the initial conditions require that @xmath21 the physical meaning of this statement is that if we start at one of two targets the search process is finished immediately .",
    "it is convenient to solve eqs .",
    "( [ me1 ] ) , ( [ me2 ] ) , ( [ me3 ] ) and ( [ me4 ] ) by employing laplace transformations of the first - passage probability functions , @xmath22 @xcite . the details of calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "it is important to note here that the explicit expressions for the first - passage probability distribution functions in the laplace form provide us with a full dynamic description of the protein search @xcite .",
    "for example , the mean first - passage time to reach any of the target sites if the original position of the protein was in the solution ( @xmath23 ) , which we also associate with the search time , can be directly calculated from @xcite @xmath24 as shown in the appendix , the average search time is given by @xmath25}{k_{on } k_{off } s_{i}(0)},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a new auxiliary function with a subscript specifying the number of targets ( @xmath27 for the system with two targets ) . for this function",
    "we have @xmath28}{(1-y)(1+y^{2 m_1 -1})(1+y^{1 + 2(l - m_2)})(1+y^{m_2-m_1})},\\ ] ] with @xmath29 it is important that for @xmath30 , as expected , our results reduce to expressions for the protein search on dna with only one target @xcite .",
    "similar procedures can be used to estimate all other dynamic properties for the system with two targets .",
    "we can extend this approach for any number of targets and for any spatial distribution of binding sites .",
    "this is discussed in detail in the appendix .",
    "surprisingly , the expression for the search times are the _ same _ in all cases but with different @xmath31 functions that depend on the number of specific binding sites and their spatial distributions",
    ". analytical results for @xmath31 for the protein search on dna with three or four targets , as well as a general procedure for arbitrary number of specific binding sites , are also presented in the appendix .",
    "because our theoretical method provides explicit formulas for all relevant quantities , it allows us to fully explore many aspects of the protein search mechanisms . the first problem that we can address",
    "is related to the role of the spatial distribution of targets on the search dynamics . in other words ,",
    "the question is how the search time is influenced by exact positions of all targets along the dna .",
    "the results of our calculations for two specific binding sites are presented in fig .",
    "the longest search times are found when two targets are at different ends of the molecule , and the distance between them along the dna curve , @xmath32 , is the largest possible and equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the search is faster if targets are moved closer to each other and both distributed symmetrically with respect to the middle point of the dna molecule ( fig .",
    "2 ) . moving the targets too close ( @xmath34 ) starts to increase the search time again : see fig .",
    "2 . for short dna chains",
    ", it can be shown that there is an optimal distance between two targets , @xmath35 , that yields the fastest search ( fig .",
    "it corresponds to the most optimal positions of the specific sites to be at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the last result is slightly unexpected since simple symmetry arguments suggest that the fastest search would be observed for the uniform distribution of targets , i.e. when the distance between the specific sites and the distance between the ends and targets are the same , i.e. , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is not observed in fig .",
    "2 . to explain this",
    ", one can argue that the search on the dna molecule of length @xmath0 with @xmath12 targets can be mapped into the search on @xmath12 dna segments of variable lengths with only one target per each segment . in this case , positioning each target in the middle of the corresponding segment leads to the fastest search dynamics.@xcite this suggests that the most optimal distribution of @xmath12 symmetrically distributed targets is a uniform distribution with the distance between two neighboring targets equal to @xmath40 .",
    "but then the first and the last targets will be separated from the corresponding ends by a shorter distance @xmath41 .",
    "this is exactly what we see in fig . 2 for @xmath42 targets .",
    "the reason that distances between the ends and the closest targets deviate from the distances between the targets is the reflecting boundary conditions at the ends that are assumed in our model : see eqs .",
    "( [ me2 ] ) and ( [ me3 ] ) .    the results presented in fig .",
    "2 also illustrate another interesting observation .",
    "increasing the length of dna effectively eliminates the minimum in the search time for specific symmetric locations of the targets .",
    "essentially , for @xmath43 , which is much closer to realistic conditions in most cases , any two position of the targets inside the dna chain will be optimal and will have the same search time as long as they are not at the ends .",
    "we will discuss the reason for this below .",
    "one of the main advantages of our method is the ability to explicitly analyze the search dynamics for all ranges of relevant parameters .",
    "this allows us to construct a comprehensive dynamic phase diagram that delineates different search regimes .",
    "the results are presented in fig . 3 for the systems with different numbers of specific binding sites .",
    "the important observation is that general features of the search behavior are independent of the number of targets .    more specifically , there are three dynamic phases that depend on the relative values of the length of dna @xmath0 , the average scanning length @xmath44 and the size of the target ( taken to be equal to unity in our model ) . for @xmath45 the random - walk regime",
    "is observed with the search time being quadraticaly proportional to the size of dna @xcite . in this case , the protein non - specifically binds dna and it does not dissociate until it finds one of the targets .",
    "the quadratic scaling is a result of a simple random - walk unbiased diffusion of the protein molecule on dna during the search . for the intermediate sliding regime , @xmath46 ,",
    "the protein binds to dna , scans it , unbinds and repeats this cycle at average @xmath47 times ( @xmath12 is number of the targets ) for symmetrically distributed specific sites . for more general distributions",
    "the number of search cycles is also proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to the linear scaling in the search times .",
    "for @xmath49 we have the jumping regime where the protein can bind to any site on dna and dissociate from it , but it can not slide along the dna chain .",
    "the search time is again proportional to @xmath0 because on average the protein must check @xmath0 sites .",
    "these changes in the dynamic search behavior are illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , in which the search times as a function of the dna lengths are presented for different scanning lengths . the slope variation indicates a change in the scaling behavior in the search times from @xmath50 to @xmath0 as the dna length increases for fixed @xmath51 .",
    "it is also important to note here that the concept of the most optimal positions of targets is not working for the sliding regime ( @xmath52 ) because the protein during the search frequently unbinds from the dna , losing all memory about what it already scanned .",
    "this concept also can not be defined in the jumping regime where the protein does not slide at all . from this point of view , any position of the targets are equivalent .",
    "the only two positions that differ from others are the end sites in the sliding regime .",
    "this is because they can be reached only via one neighboring site , while all other sites can be reached via two neighboring sites ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .      the most interesting question for this system is to analyze quantitatively the effect of multiple targets on search dynamics . to quantify this",
    "we define a new function , @xmath53 , which we call an acceleration , @xmath54 this is a ratio of the search times for the case of one target and for the case of @xmath12 targets .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 gives a numerical value of how the presence of multiple targets increases the rate of association to any specific binding site .",
    "the results for acceleration are presented in figs .",
    "first , we analyze the situation when targets in all cases are in the most optimal symmetric positions , which is shown in fig .",
    "5 . for dna with the single target it is in the middle of the chain , while for dna with @xmath12 targets they are distributed uniformly , as we discussed above , with the distance @xmath40 between the internal targets and @xmath55 for boundary targets and dna ends .",
    "the acceleration for these conditions depends on the dynamic search regimes , and it ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath56 : see fig .",
    "5 . for the case of @xmath57 ( jumping and sliding regimes ) , on average",
    "the number of search excursions to dna before finding the specific site is equal to @xmath40 , and this leads to a linear behavior in the acceleration ( @xmath58 ) . for @xmath45 ( random - walk regime ) , the search is one - dimensional and the protein must diffuse on average the distance @xmath40 before it can find any of the targets .",
    "the quadratic scaling for the simple random walk naturally explains the acceleration in the search in this dynamic regime , @xmath59 .",
    "however , the acceleration is also affected by the distance between the targets .",
    "if we maintain the most optimal conditions for the dna with one target but vary the distance between multiple targets , while keeping the overall symmetry , the results are shown in fig .",
    "6 . in this case",
    ", putting targets too close to each other or moving them apart lowers the acceleration .",
    "eventually , there will be no acceleration for these conditions ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "but the results are much more interesting if we consider the non - symmetric distributions of targets .",
    "surprisingly , the search time for the system with multiple targets can be even slower than for the single target system ! this is shown in fig .",
    "7 where @xmath53 can be as low as 1/4 for the two - target system in the random - walk regime , or it can reach the value of 1/2 in the sliding and jumping regimes ( not shown ) . the single target in the most optimal position in the middle of the dna chain can be found much faster in comparison with the case of two targets seating near one of the ends .",
    "these observations suggest that the degree of acceleration of the search process due to the presence multiple targets is not always a linear function of the number of specific binding sites .",
    "it depends on the nature of the dynamic search phase , the distance between the targets and the spatial distribution of the targets .",
    "varying these parameters can lead to larger accelerations as well as to unexpected decelerations .",
    "it is a consequence of the complex mechanism of the protein search for targets on dna that combines 3d and 1d motions .",
    "this is the main result of our paper .",
    "recently , single - molecule experiments measured the facilitated search of _ lac _ repressor proteins on dna with two identical specific binding sites @xcite .",
    "these experiments show that the association rate increases before reaching the saturation with the increase in the distance between the targets .",
    "our theoretical model successfully describes these measurements , as shown in fig .",
    "fitting these data , we estimate the 1d diffusion rate for the lac repressors as @xmath61 s@xmath62 , which is consistent with _ in vitro _ measured values @xcite .",
    "our estimates for the sliding length , @xmath63 bp , and for the non - specific association to dna , @xmath64 s@xmath62 , also agree with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "it is important to compare our results with predictions from the theoretical model presented in ref @xcite .",
    "this continuum model was developed assuming that the length of dna is extremely long , @xmath65 .",
    "it was shown that the acceleration for the search for the case of two targets can be simply written as @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the distance between targets .",
    "the comparison between two theoretical approaches is given in figs .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "9 that both models agree for very large dna lengths , @xmath43 , while for shorter dna chains there are significant deviations .",
    "the continuum theory @xcite predicts that the acceleration is always a linear or sub - linear function of the number of targets , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "our model shows that the acceleration can have a non - linear dependence on the number of the targets , @xmath59 .",
    "more specifically , this can be seen in fig .",
    "10 , where the acceleration is presented as a function of the scanning length @xmath51 .",
    "the prediction of the continuum theory that for @xmath69 the acceleration always approaches the unity is unphysical .",
    "clearly , if we consider , e.g. , the optimal distribution of targets , then the larger the number of specific binding sites , the shorter the search time .",
    "the reason for the failure of the continuum model at this limit is its inability to properly account for all dynamic search regimes .",
    "this analysis shows that the continuum model @xcite has a very limited application , while our theoretical approach is consistent with all experimental observations and provides a valid physical picture for all conditions .",
    "we investigated theoretically the effect of the multiple targets in the protein search for specific binding sites on dna .",
    "this was done by extending and generalizing the discrete - state stochastic method , originally developed for single targets , that explicitly takes into account the most important biochemical and biophysical processes . using the first - passage processes ,",
    "all dynamic properties of the system can be directly evaluated .",
    "it was found that the search dynamics is affected by the spatial distribution of the targets for not very long dna chains .",
    "there are optimal positions for specific sites for which the search times are minimal .",
    "we argued that this optimal distribution is almost uniform with a correction due to the dna chain ends .",
    "we also constructed a dynamic phase diagram for the different search regimes .",
    "it was shown that for any number of targets there are always three phases , which are determined by comparing the dna length , the scanning length and the size of the target .",
    "furthermore , we investigated the quantitative acceleration in the search due to the presence of multiple targets for various sets of conditions .",
    "it was found also that the acceleration is linearly proportional to the number of targets when the scanning length is less than the dna length . for larger scanning lengths ,",
    "the acceleration becomes faster with the quadratic dependence on the number of targets .",
    "however , changing the distances between the targets generally decreases the effect of acceleration .",
    "unexpectedly , we found that varying also the spatial distributions can reverse the behavior : it might take longer to find the specific site in the system with multiple targets in comparison with properly positioned single target .",
    "our model allows us to explain this complex behavior using simple physical - chemical arguments .",
    "in addition , we applied our theoretical analysis for describing experimental data , and it is shown that the obtained dynamic parameters are consistent with measured experimental quantities . a comparison between our discrete - state theoretical method the continuum model is also presented .",
    "we show that the continuum model has a limited range of applicability , and it produces the unphysical behavior at some limiting cases . at the same time , our approach is fully consistent at all sets of parameters .",
    "our theoretical predictions were also fully validated with monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "the presented theoretical model seems to be successful in explaining the complex protein search dynamics in the systems with multiple targets .",
    "one of the main advantage of the method is the ability to have a fully analytical description for all dynamic properties in the system .",
    "however , one should remember that this approach is still quite oversimplified , and it neglects many realistic features of the protein - dna interactions .",
    "for example , dna molecule is assumed to be frozen , different protein conformations that are observed in experiments are not taken into account , and the possibility of correlations between 3d and 1d motions is also not considered .",
    "it will be critically important to test the presented theoretical ideas in experiments as well as in more advanced theoretical methods .",
    "the work was supported by the welch foundation ( grant c-1559 ) , by the nsf ( grant che-1360979 ) , and by the center for theoretical biological physics sponsored by the nsf ( grant phy-1427654 ) .",
    "this appendix includes detailed derivations of the equations from the main text and explicit expressions for functions utilized in our calculations .    to solve the backward master equations ( 1)-(5 ) for the system with two targets we use the laplace transformation which leads to @xmath70+k_{off }",

    "<S> it is found that multiple targets in most cases accelerate the search in comparison with a single target situation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the acceleration is not always proportional to the number of targets . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , there are even situations when it takes longer to find one of the multiple targets in comparison with the single target . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the spatial position of the targets , distances between them , average scanning lengths of protein molecules on dna , and the total dna lengths . </S>",
    "<S> physical - chemical explanations of observed results are presented . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are compared with experimental observations as well as with results from a continuum theory for the protein search . </S>",
    "<S> extensive monte carlo computer simulations fully support our theoretical calculations . </S>"
