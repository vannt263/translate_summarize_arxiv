    "it has been pointed out by several authors for a long time , see e.g. @xcite , that the discrete character of the renormalization group transformation may in principle give rise to a periodic modulation of the critical amplitude .",
    "this oscillation has been then observed in hierarchical models , see for example @xcite that deal in particular with ising and potts models on diamond lattices .",
    "the modulation of the critical amplitude in these models turns out to be very small and the nature of this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated .",
    "here we consider this phenomenon for a particular hierarchical model , the wetting or pinning hierarchical model @xcite , because it is arguably the easiest set - up and it makes a direct contact with a vast mathematical literature : iteration of polynomial maps .",
    "in fact the partition function of a hierarchical model with pinning potential @xmath0 and volume size @xmath1 if just @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we set @xmath8 and @xmath9 : we assume the _ super - criticality condition _",
    "@xmath10 , so that @xmath11 is an unstable fixed point of @xmath12 and the sequence @xmath13 increases to infinity .",
    "actually it is straightforward to see that the increase is super - exponentially fast and just a little more work leads to the existence of the free energy density of the model @xmath14 we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) for the existence of this limit as well as for various properties of @xmath15 , such as the fact that @xmath15 is a convex non - decreasing function . as a matter of fact , it is immediate to see that @xmath16 for @xmath17 , while @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the origin is therefore necessarily a critical point and it is actually associated to a _ localization transition _ ( see @xcite and references therein for details on the statistical mechanics context , about which we are particularly concise here ) .",
    "one is then particularly interested in the free energy critical behavior , that is how @xmath20 behaves near @xmath21 , which , in this case , of course reduces to considering @xmath22 .",
    "what is argued in the aforementioned physical literature is that the expected critical behavior must be of the form @xmath23 where the amplitude @xmath24 is @xmath25-periodic , which is of course compatible with @xmath26 being constant .",
    "we point out that the hierarchical model in @xcite has @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 ( to be precise in @xcite the _ dual _ model with @xmath32 replaced by @xmath33 and @xmath34 is considered , see @xcite for the equivalence of these two models ) .",
    "the restriction to @xmath27 is just for the sake of simplicity , but the choice of @xmath29 reflects a symmetry of the model that has no particular impact on the issue we tackle in this note : @xcite deal with _ disordered _ hierarchical pinning and in the presence of disorder the fact that @xmath35 leads to a new phenomenon ( but this is not not the case in absence of disorder ) .    in @xcite and with a substantially more detailed analysis in @xcite the authors tackle the issue of establishing whether @xmath26 is trivial or not and of understanding the origin and size of the fluctuations . in @xcite an argument is presented , in the ising and potts models framework , that is expected to capture the size of the critical amplitude oscillations , but it yields an amplitude that is smaller than the true one , obtained numerically , by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the authors argue heuristically about the reason of such a mismatch between their arguments and numerics and they point out the role of the geometry of the julia set of the map associated to this model . in this direction",
    "they actually provide a relatively precise estimate of the oscillation amplitude by exploiting empirical estimates on the julia set , even if they admit that the precision of their computation is surprising and _ presumably merely to be considered as a lucky circumstance",
    "_ @xcite . clarifying the relation between julia set and",
    "oscillations is one of the main aims of this note .",
    "an important observation at this point is that there is a probabilistic representation of the partition function of the hierarchical pinning model @xcite .",
    "consider in fact a random branching process , or galton - watson process , starting from one individual at time zero and with offspring distribution determined by the @xmath36 s weights .",
    "therefore if one focuses on the number of individuals @xmath37 that are present at time @xmath38 , then , conditionally on @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the sum of @xmath41 independent and identically distributed random variables for which the probability of being equal to @xmath42 is @xmath36 .",

    "t.  e.  harris pointed out ( among several other facts ) that @xmath50 where @xmath51  the _ harris function _  is continuous and @xmath25-periodic .",
    "harris was unable to show that @xmath52 is not constant , even if he was able to compute numerically the value of @xmath53 for @xmath27 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 up to six decimal digits , a remarkable achievement considering the date at which the paper was published .",
    "later it became clear that @xmath52 does oscillate and that the amplitude of the oscillation is extremely small with respect to its _ average _ value ( see in particular @xcite , but also @xcite ) .",
    "a full understanding of this near - constant behavior is however still elusive .",
    "actually analogous phenomena were recorded also in other mathematical fields like combinatorial enumeration , spectral properties of transition operators on fractals and more ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ultimately , this is not surprising because all these problems boil down to studying iterations of a map : in the galton - watson case for example tells us that the generating function of the law of @xmath37 is precisely @xmath56 .",
    "certainly it has not escaped the reader that the qualitative properties of @xmath52 coincide with the ( expected ) qualitative properties of the critical amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "however the quantitative connection between @xmath52 and @xmath26 , beyond the common period @xmath57 , is a priori not clear . in statistical mechanics terms , the harris function @xmath52 emerges from the limit of the partition function in a particular vanishing limit of the pinning parameter @xmath58 : @xmath59 and then @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath26 comes also out of a limit of vanishing pinning parameter , but in this case @xmath61 is taken at fixed pinning parameter @xmath19 , only the leading laplace asymptotic term is kept , and then @xmath32 is sent to zero .",

    "proposition  [ th : qualit ] can be proven in a rather direct way by exploiting a number of relations that one can find in the large literature devoted to the subject , but we have been unable to find the statement in this literature .",
