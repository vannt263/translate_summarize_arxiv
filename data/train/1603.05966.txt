    "renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power have a high degree of unpredictability and time variation , which makes balancing demand and supply increasingly challenging .",
    "one way to address this challenge is to harness the inherent flexibility in demand of many types of loads .",
    "loads can supply a range of ancillary services to the grid , such as the balancing reserves required at bonneville power authority ( bpa ) , or the reg - d / a regulation reserves used at pjm @xcite .",
    "today these services are secured by a balancing authority ( ba ) in each region .",
    "these grid services can be obtained without impacting quality of service ( qos ) for consumers @xcite , but this is only possible through design .",
    "the term _ demand dispatch _ is used in this paper to emphasize the difference between the goals of our own work and traditional demand response .",
    "consumers use power for a reason , and expect some guarantees on the qos they receive .",
    "the grid operator desires reliable ancillary service , obtained from the inherent flexibility in the consumer s power consumption .",
    "these seemingly conflicting goals can be achieved simultaneously , but the solution requires local control : an appliance must monitor its qos and other state variables , it must receive grid - level information ( e.g. , from the ba ) , and based on this information it must adjust its power consumption . with proper design , an aggregate of loads can be viewed at the grid - level as _ virtual energy storage _ ( ves ) .",
    "just like a battery , the aggregate provides ancillary service , even though it can not produce energy .",
    "shows the wind generation in the bpa region during the first week of 2015 .",
    "there is virtually no power generated on new year s day , and generation ramps up to nearly 4gw on the morning of january 5 . in this example",
    "we show how to supply a demand of exactly 4gw during this time period , using generation from wind and other resources .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the additional power required at time @xmath1 , in units of gws .",
    "for example , on the first day of this week we have @xmath2 .",
    "day - ahead forecast of the low frequency component of generation from wind is highly predictable .",
    "we let @xmath3 denote the signal obtained by passing the forecast of @xmath4 through a low pass filter .",
    "the signal @xmath5 is obtained by filtering @xmath6 using a high pass filter , and @xmath7 .",
    "each of these filters is causal , and their parameters are a design choice .",
    "examples are shown in .",
    "it is not difficult to ramp hydro - generation up and down to accurately track the power signal @xmath3 .",
    "this is an energy product that might be secured in today s day - ahead markets .",
    "the other two signals shown in take on positive and negative values . each represents a total energy of approximately zero ,",
    "hence it would be a mistake to attempt to obtain these services in an energy market .",
    "either could be obtained from a large fleet of batteries or flywheels .",
    "however , it may be much cheaper to employ flexible loads via demand dispatch .",
    "the signal @xmath5 can be obtained by modulating the fans in commercial buildings ( perhaps by less than 10% ) @xcite .",
    "the signal @xmath8 can be supplied in whole or in part by loads such as water heaters , commercial refrigeration , and water chillers .",
    "low frequency variability from solar gives rise to the famous `` duck curve '' anticipated at caiso , which is represented as the hypothetical `` net - load curve '' in .",
    "the actual net - load curve is the difference between load and generation from renewables ; the drop from 20 to 10 gw is expected with the introduction of 10 gw of solar in the state of california .",
    "this curve highlights the ramping pressure placed on conventional generation resources .",
    "as shown in this figure , the volatility and steep ramps associated with california s duck curve can be addressed using a frequency decomposition : the plot shows how the net - load can be expressed as the sum of four signals distinguished by frequency .",
    "variability introduced by the low frequency component can be rejected using traditional resources such as thermal generators , along with some flexible loads ( e.g. , from flexible industrial manufacturing ) . the mid - pass signal shown in the figure",
    "would be a challenge to generators for various reasons , but this zero - mean signal , as well as the higher frequency components , can be tracked using a variety of flexible loads .",
    "the control architecture described in this paper is not limited to handling disturbances from wind and solar energy . illustrates how the same frequency decomposition can be used to allocate resources following an unexpected contingency , such as a generator outage .",
    "0.45     0.45     for loads whose power consumption can not be varied continuously , we have argued in prior work that a distributed randomized control architecture is convenient for design @xcite .",
    "this architecture includes local control to maintain bounds on the quality of service delivered by the loads , and also to ensure high quality ancillary service to the grid .",
    "analysis of the aggregate is based on a mean - field model .",

    "in this prior work it is assumed that average power consumption is obtained through measurements or state estimation : assume that @xmath24 is the power consumption when the load is in state @xmath12 , for some function @xmath25 .",
