    "the horizontal structure of jupiter s zonal ( east - west ) winds at the level of the visible cloud deck on jupiter have been observed for many decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the vertical structure of zonal winds is not well known  especially away from the cloud deck and in the equatorial region .",
    "this is because of the lack of usable tracers and the breakdown of the thermal wind relation near the equator , preventing latitudinal temperature measurements to be related to the vertical wind shear .    in december 1995",
    "the galileo probe entered jupiter s upper atmosphere at 6@xmath4  n , above a @xmath5 m hot spot in the north equatorial belt . during the descent",
    "the atmospheric structure instrument on board collected information about the density , pressure , and temperature of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "analysis of the temperature profile in the thermospheric and stratospheric regions identified discernible perturbations which have been interpreted as manifestations of internal , or vertically propagating , gravity waves @xcite .",
    "vertical temperature profiles for jupiter s atmosphere have also been obtained from occultation studies using stars and other spacecraft .",
    "a number of these profiles contain oscillations that have been characterised as manifestations of internal gravity waves as well @xcite .",
    "gravity waves are oscillations of fluid parcels about their altitudes of neutral buoyancy @xcite .",
    "the waves are a common feature of stably stratified atmospheres .",
    "they have been captured in images of jupiter s clouds , typically near the planet s equator @xcite .",
    "1 shows an example .",
    "internal gravity waves ( hereafter simply gravity waves ) grow in amplitude , due to the fall in background atmospheric density .",
    "the dynamics of such waves is described by the taylor ",
    "goldstein equation @xcite ,    @xmath6    here @xmath7 is the perturbation in the vertical wind , which is adjusted for the amplitude growth and also assumed to be oscillatory ( wave - like ) in the horizontal direction and time ; @xmath8 is a function that represents the source and dissipation of waves ; and , @xmath9 is the vertical wavenumber , which depends on the physical properties of the medium in which the waves propagate .",
    "specifically ,    @xmath10^{1/2}\\hspace*{-.2 cm } ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the brunt  visl ( buoyancy ) frequency ; @xmath12 is the intrinsic phase speed , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the horizontal phase speed and @xmath15 is the zonal wind ; @xmath16 is the density scale height ; and , @xmath17 is the horizontal wavenumber . in general , all of the variables depend on altitude @xmath18 .",
    "crucially , the zonal wind profile @xmath19 can be obtained by solving for @xmath20 in equation  ( 2 ) . in this letter we present a profile from this inversion that span much larger range of altitude above the 1  bar level ( range of @xmath21  km ) than in past analyses .",
    "for the inversion we compute @xmath16 from the collected density profile .",
    "we also use @xmath22  km@xmath23 from the average value obtained in analysis of voyager images @xcite .",
    "other analyses have reported slightly different values ( e.g. , average of @xmath24  km@xmath23 by @xcite ) ; however , as long as @xmath25 ( as is the case here ) , the value of @xmath17 does not significantly alter the result of the inversion . @xmath11 and @xmath9 are obtained from the potential temperature , @xmath26 , related to specific entropy of the atmosphere ; here @xmath27 is the temperature , @xmath28 is the pressure , @xmath29  bar is a constant reference pressure and @xmath30 with @xmath31 the specific gas constant and @xmath32 the specific heat at constant pressure . to obtain @xmath11 and @xmath9 , we decompose @xmath33 into a mean background @xmath34 ( extracted using a spatially - moving fitting window ) and a small perturbation @xmath35 about the mean ( presumed caused by mesoscale gravity waves ) .",
    "such decomposition of temperature is standard in gravity wave studies @xcite , and is reasonable here given that the spatial scales of the background and waves are well separated .",
    "further , the horizontal distance travelled by the probe in the region studied , 3300  km , is small compared to jupiter s circumference and is completely within the hot - spot entered by probe @xcite ; hence , zonal variation in the background over this distance is not expected to be significant .",
    "2a shows the relative perturbation , @xmath36 , resulting from a 75  km- wide moving window .",
    "we have checked that the result is not affected by the choice of window size , by varying the size from 55  km to 85  km .",
    "2b shows @xmath37^{1/2}$ ] resulting from the decomposition ; here @xmath38 is the gravity . in the figure note",
    "that @xmath11 is much smaller in the region below @xmath3920  km than that above ( the stratosphere)in agreement with @xcite , whose observations give @xmath40  s@xmath23 in the lower region .",
    "this represents a possible ducting region , a source for the waves in the probe data .",
    "although @xmath7 information was not collected by the probe , @xmath41 can still be obtained from @xmath42 through the polarization relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this",
    "we generate a series of lomb - scargle periodograms @xcite of the @xmath42 data , which is non - uniformly spaced in @xmath18 .",
    "the non - uniform spacing renders analysis by standard fourier or wavelet transforms unsuitable .",
    "one periodogram at each @xmath18 is generated using a smoothing window .",
    "we have also verified in this procedure that the obtained result varies little between different sized smoothing windows .",
    "all the periodograms are subsequently combined to produce a two - dimensional map of the wave spectral energy density as a function of wavenumber and altitude , @xmath43 , shown in fig .  3 ; here @xmath44 is the vertical wavenumber  @xmath9 prior to an adjustment for wave propagation geometry . before discussing this adjustment , we discuss three features which are already apparent in the @xmath45 map .",
    "first , gravity waves identified previously @xcite are recovered ( w1 and w2 in the map ) .",
    "this agreement gives confidence in our procedure .",
    "in addition to those waves , we identify in our analysis new gravity waves throughout the analyzed domain . in particular , note the high energy density ( dark red ) regions near the 50  km , 300  km and 400  km altitudes all with @xmath46 . these constitute new waves .",
    "second , we identify a region consistent with a turbopause @xmath3950  km thick , centered at approximately 400  km altitude . this is the region where the width of the sub - spectrum containing significant energy increases markedly . in this region ,",
    "molecular diffusion becomes comparable to eddy diffusion and gravity waves  growing in amplitude as they propagate upward  break , transferring energy into the higher wavenumbers . above this region ,",
    "energy is lower across the entire spectrum and the spectrum itself is much steeper ( i.e. , narrower ) than that for the turbopause region . above the turbopause region ,",
    "the atmosphere becomes inhomogeneous , separating out into layers of different molecular species .",
    "past studies have placed jupiter s turbopause at the @xmath47bar @xcite and @xmath48bar @xcite levels , based on observations and modeling .",
    "our result supports the latter location .",
    "third , in the lower part of the analyzed domain there appears to be a ducting region , a region with a sharp jump in @xmath11 . as already noted , such a region can serve as a source of gravity waves . horizontally propagating gravity waves in this region",
    "have previously been observed ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 )",
    ", which have been suggested as waves trapped in a `` leaky '' duct .",
    "the ducted wave travels horizontally by undergoing internal reflections at the boundaries ; however , part of the wave escapes the duct to propagate vertically .",
    "because the wavenumber with maximum energy in the @xmath45 map can be traced down to the ducting region , it is likely that the waves have come from there .",
    "note that above the ducting region the number of local peaks in the spectrum generally reduces with altitude ( the centroid of the spectrum at each height is shifted to lower wavenumber ) . also , the magnitude of the peak energy in the low wavenumber ( white line in fig .",
    "3 ) is high at first , then decreases , and then increases again along the white line , until the topside of the turbopause region at @xmath49  km above the 1  bar level .",
    "this is indicative of wave saturation or encounters with a critical layer , where @xmath50 locally , for high number wavenumbers as they propagate upward .",
    "the second or third multi - peaked altitude regions , between @xmath51  km and @xmath52  km above the 1  bar level , may be due to wave breaking and secondary wave generation from breaking layers .    as alluded to earlier",
    ", @xmath44 differs from the required wavenumber @xmath9 .",
    "the latter is the wavenumber that would be observed by a probe travelling in a vertical direction .",
    "however , throughout most of its entry phase , the probe had a shallow angle of attack ( @xmath53 below the horizontal ) , which changes the wavenumber observed by the probe during its passage in the upper part of the analyzed domain .",
    "we use the geometry of the probe s path to obtain the true vertical wavenumber ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the angle of attack and @xmath56 is the angle the wavevector makes with the horizontal .",
    "we make no correction for the relative motion of the probe with respect to the wave since the probe s velocity is supersonic ( indeed , hypersonic , with up to mach 51 ) for much of the entry phase .",
    "gravity wave phase speeds are subsonic .",
    "although @xmath57 is known from the probe s trajectory @xcite , @xmath56 is not . to estimate this quantity , we assume that the probe s trajectory is vertical in the period just before parachute deployment .",
    "this is not far from the actual situation since the probe s angle of attack was @xmath58 just before the parachute was deployed , near the lower boundary of our domain . in this region ,",
    "@xmath59 ; and , since    @xmath60    we have @xmath61 . also , in this region",
    "@xmath62  km@xmath23 ( giving vertical wavelength of @xmath63  km ) , in good agreement with previously recovered values @xcite . now",
    ", all the parameters required to recover @xmath12 have been obtained , and a vertical profile for @xmath12 can be estimated .    finally , to obtain @xmath15 from @xmath12 a value for the horizontal phase speed @xmath14 is required .",
    "this is not well known .",
    "however , equatorial gravity waves with a phase speed of about 100  m  s@xmath23 greater than the winds have been observed in images of jupiter s clouds returned by new horizons @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath64  m  s@xmath23 .",
    "the doppler wind experiment ( dwe ) on the probe has measured the zonal winds to be approximately this speed in the deeper atmosphere @xcite , suggesting that the waves could have been driven by convective overshoot below the clouds .",
    "this value also agrees well with the 140195  m  s@xmath23 range reported for the similar region , at the probe entry site @xcite .",
    "somewhat smaller values ( approximately 70145  m  s@xmath23 ) have been obtained for waves at different longitudes @xcite . such variation in @xmath14",
    "does not change the shape of the @xmath15 profile we recover , but the magnitude would be reduced .",
    "variations of @xmath14 with altitude would increase the uncertainty as well , but they are expected to be small and not fundamentally change the profile .",
    "this gives the profile for @xmath65 shown in fig .",
    "we have used @xmath66  m  s@xmath23 .",
    "the standard deviation shown indicates the variation in the profile given by the various smoothing window sizes considered in constructing @xmath45 .",
    "the dwe reported flow speeds that increase with depth reaching @xmath67  m  s@xmath23 at the @xmath68  bar level and then remaining high at lower levels @xcite .",
    "the upper part of the dwe profile is shown in fig .",
    "the wind speed at the bottom of our profile agrees well with that at the top of the dwe profile .",
    "our profile shows increasing zonal wind speed with altitude ( up to @xmath69  km above the 1  bar level ) .",
    "this implies that the wind speed is a minimum near the cloud - top level .",
    "this is similar to what has been observed from studies using the thermal wind equation @xcite .",
    "however , in our profile this high speed wind is not a jet , as the zonal wind speed does not diminish appreciably with altitude near this level .",
    "in fact , the speed is roughly constant throughout the stratosphere , starting from this level .",
    "there are some fluctuations of the order of 20  m  s@xmath23 in the wind speed in the thermosphere .",
    "the richardson number , @xmath70 , is greater than @xmath71 for the entire profile , which indicates the flow is stable with respect to kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "temporal variations in the temperature profile of jupiter s equatorial stratosphere have been observed to have a period of @xmath72 to @xmath68 years and are therefore known as the quasi - quadrennial oscillation ( qqo ) @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have been linked to variations in the zonal wind observed via cloud - tracking on jupiter with a period of @xmath394.4  years @xcite .",
    "further , a jet located just north of the equator , derived using the thermal wind equation applied to data gathered in december 2000 and january 2001 , has been linked to the qqo @xcite .",
    "a jet of similar magnitude , just south of the equator , has been observed in observations gathered in 1979 @xcite ( which fits well with a period of 4.4  years ) , suggesting this jet may be oscillating about the equator .",
    "no such jet is visible in our profile .",
    "however , the probe entered jupiter s atmosphere 5 years before the northern jet was observed .",
    "thus , our profile is consistent with such an oscillation as the jet would be located south of the equator , away from the probe entry site , at the time the probe entered .",
    "gravity wave creation and dissipation is associated with heating and cooling of the atmosphere . ignoring molecular viscosity , which is only important above the turbopause ,",
    "the heating rate is proportional to the vertical gradient of energy flux ",
    "specifically ,      we estimate the energy flux , @xmath74 , from @xmath35 using the polarization relations to derive the perturbations in the geopotential @xmath75 and the vertical velocity @xmath7 .",
    "the flux comes from the zonal average of the product of these quantities .",
    "since the product is not available to us we average over a single vertical wavelength instead . the heating rate profile thus obtained",
    "is shown in fig  4b .",
    "it can be seen that heating is small through the stratosphere .",
    "indeed , on average it is very close to zero .",
    "it is only in the thermosphere that the average heating rate deviates from zero with a magnitude of @xmath76 0.5  k per jupiter rotation .",
    "the flux responsible for heating in this region is small ( @xmath77  w  m@xmath78 ) , compared to radiation fluxes measured in the troposphere ( @xmath79  w  m@xmath78 ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the peak heating rate magnitude is about 50 times larger , partly because the lower thermsopshere is much less dense than the troposphere .",
    "the circulation of jupiter s stratosphere is important for understanding the planet s circulation as a whole .",
    "the location of the turbopause is essential for understanding the coupling between jupiter s upper atmosphere and the circulation in the lower atmosphere .",
    "the juno mission will explore the troposphere of jupiter to depths of @xmath80  bar or more .",
    "this will provide better insight to the source and behaviour of gravity waves in the troposphere , possibly allowing better limits to be derived for the wave - vector angle @xmath56 in our analysis and better understanding of the mechanisms that generate the gravity waves .",
    "the planned jupiter icy moon explorer ( juice ) mission will directly study gravity wave activity and zonal winds in the stratosphere of jupiter , extending the result present here .",
