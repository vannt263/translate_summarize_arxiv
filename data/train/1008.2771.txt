    "we follow the evolution of star clusters using the direct summation code nbody6 ( aarseth 2003 ) run with its gpu extension on the ncsa lincoln cluster .",
    "the code models the effects of internal relaxation with an accurate treatment of the multiple interactions between stars obtained thanks to special regularization techniques .",
    "the initial structure of the clusters is that of tidally limited king ( 1966 ) models . in the simulations presented here ,",
    "the initial star masses are drawn either from a miller & scalo ( 1979 ) or a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function .",

    "( 2000 ) evolutionary tracks .",
    "the evolution of the clusters has been followed until either @xmath21 ( with the time expressed in n - body units , equivalent to the cluster dynamical time ) was reached ( corresponding to several initial relaxation times  @xmath22 ) or at least 80% of the initial mass was lost due to evaporation of stars .    in order to explore the role of primordial hard binaries ,",
    "our sample of simulations includes systems without primordial binaries as well as systems with an initial fraction of binaries @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the number of binary stars ) ranging from 0 to 0.1 .",

    "; the comparison of the results of systems with a miller - scalo and a salpeter initial mass function ( which have a similar fraction of white dwarfs and neutron stars but produce a significantly different fraction of stellar - mass black holes : @xmath30 for miller - scalo and @xmath31 for salpeter ) allows us to explore the dependence of our results on the fraction of massive dark remnants .",

    "as our simulations only have an instantaneous step of stellar evolution , we do not consider stars along the giant branch .",
    "this choice is appropriate to create a surface brightness profile for main sequence stars .",
    "focusing on main sequence stars leads to a significant reduction in the surface brightness profile fluctuations arising from the small number of luminous giants that would otherwise dominate the light profile .",

    "previous simulations of clusters with an imbh ( baumgardt et al . 2005 ) show that shallow cusps extend to about @xmath40 . in order to estimate the range of values of @xmath5 obtained with this procedure when a cluster structure is that of a king model , we created 100 different random realizations of a king model with @xmath41 and 32k particles . after calculating the surface brightness profile for each system using the same number of annuli used in the data analysis of our simulations , we calculated @xmath5 for each random realization using data points within @xmath40 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath5 obtained is @xmath42 with a dispersion of @xmath43 .",
    "note that a small but non - zero value of @xmath5 for a king model is to be expected .",
    "this can be easily verified also by adopting the king ( 1962 ) analytical expression @xmath44 to describe the inner surface density profile of a king model : fitting this analytical profile with a power - law between @xmath45 and @xmath40 yields @xmath46 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath5 might be obtained by restricting the radial range to regions closer to the center , but such an approach may be complicated by fluctuations in the surface brightness profile of a cluster s innermost regions and , for actual data , possibly by the lack of adequate resolution .    despite the different procedure adopted to measure the inner slope ,",
    "our results are consistent within 1-sigma with the analysis of artificial images of king models discussed in noyola & gebhardt ( 2006 ; see e.g. their results for @xmath47 in the subtracted and 10% subtracted panels of their fig.4 ) .",
    "the six panels of fig .  [ fig:32k ] show the time evolution of the index @xmath5 for the simulations with 32k particles .",

    "our imbh run falls within this range presenting a shallow inner cusp with slope @xmath48 , approximately constant during the entire cluster evolution .",
    "the results of the simulation 32k ( a system with no imbh and no primordial binaries ) , on the other hand , show an evolution of @xmath5 characterized by three phases . for @xmath49 ,",

    "the system is characterized by a central shallow cusp with values of @xmath5 in the range expected for systems with an imbh .",
    "finally for @xmath51 the system that separates these three phases might differ for systems starting with a different initial concentration . ]",
    "is in the post - core - collapse phase and the slope of the inner cusp oscillates in the range @xmath52 ; these values are steeper than those predicted for clusters hosting an imbh but even during this phase , as a consequence of fluctuations and measurement errors , @xmath5 may occasionally fall in the range of values expected for globular clusters hosting an imbh .    for systems with primordial binaries , the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:32k ] show that , for a fraction of primordial binaries @xmath53 , the typical values of @xmath5 overlap with the range of values of a system with an imbh also for @xmath51 when the core is supported by the primordial binaries burning .",
    "this makes it impossible to distinguish whether the central shallow cusp is a consequence of the presence of an imbh or of the presence of primordial binaries in the cluster core .",

    "2008 ) .    in figure  [ fig:64k ]",
    "we show the results of our simulations with 64k particles .",
    "simulation 64k confirms the results of the lower resolution run ( 32k ) , although the larger number of particles leads to a smaller average error on the estimate of @xmath5 . in order to further illustrate the reduction in the error on @xmath5 for an increasing number of particles",
    ", we also show in figure  [ fig:64k ] a panel with the time evolution of @xmath5 obtained by combining two consecutive snapshots of the simulation 64k .",
    "the three phases in the evolution of @xmath5 described above are evident in both panels .",
    "other than the smaller error on @xmath5 for larger n , our simulations do not show any dependence of the evolution of @xmath5 on n : for the 32k run the average @xmath5 is 0.08 with a @xmath55 spread equal to 0.17 for @xmath56 while the average @xmath5 is 0.52 with a @xmath55 spread equal to 0.19 in the post - core - collapse phase @xmath57 . for the 64k run the average @xmath5 ( @xmath55 spread )",
    "is 0.11 ( 0.13 ) for @xmath56 , and 0.55 ( 0.13 ) for @xmath58 .    for simulation 64k , the difference between the measured value of @xmath5 and @xmath59 ( the lower limit of the range associated with the presence of an imbh ) is , in the post - core - collapse phase , smaller than @xmath55 20% of the time .",
    "the smaller error on @xmath5 when consecutive snapshots are combined leads to a reduced fraction of post - core - collapse snapshots ( 10% of the time in this case ) during which @xmath5 is within @xmath55 from the black hole range .",
    "simulation 64kw05 shows a similar time evolution of @xmath5 and the only difference is the delay in the onset of the core collapse phase , because of the lower initial concentration .",
    "simulation 64k5bin also confirms the results of the analogous lower resolution run ( 32k5bin ) .",
    "finally , the results of the simulation with a salpeter initial mass function show that the amount of dark remnants in a cluster plays a key role in driving the cluster evolution and in determining the shape of its inner surface brightness profile .",
    "in particular our results confirm that the presence of dark remnants can significantly delay the onset of core collapse ( see e.g. merritt et al .",
    "2004 , mackey et al .",
    "2008 , trenti et al . 2010 ) and , in doing so , they extend the pre - core - collapse phase characterized by small values of @xmath5 consistent with those of systems hosting an imbh .",
    "dark remnants also play an important role in the post - core - collapse phase : specifically , by segregating in the cluster inner regions and heating the visible cluster population , dark remnants tend to produce a shallower core - collapse cusp than that observed in systems with no primordial binaries , no imbh and a smaller population of dark remnants .",
    "our simulations show that during their evolution , clusters without an imbh are often characterized by central shallow cusps in the surface brightness profile with a slope falling in the range of values expected for systems with an imbh .    for clusters in the post - core - collapse phase with neither primordial binaries nor a significant fraction of dark remnants ,",
    "the inner cusp is steeper ( @xmath60 ) than that of systems with an imbh . if we know that a cluster is in the post - core - collapse phase and has neither primordial binaries nor a significant fraction of dark remnants , then a shallow cusp in the range @xmath1 could be indicative of an imbh .    however , a small fraction of primordial binaries ( @xmath53 ) and/or the amount of dark remnants produced assuming a salpeter stellar initial mass function ( with a 100 per cent retention of dark remnants ) act as a central heating mechanism sufficient to produce a shallow inner cusp with the same range of slope values expected for systems hosting an imbh .    figure  [ fig : summary ] summarizes the results of a representative subset of our simulations showing the different dynamical phases and cluster properties that can be associated with the presence of a shallow cusp",
    "this figure nicely illustrates the problem faced by any attempt to use a shallow cusp as an indicator of the presence of an imbh .    as an example , we plotted in fig .",

    "the values for the slope of the inner cusp of these two clusters fall within the range of values expected for systems hosting an imbh and indeed umbreit et al .",

    "[ fig : summary ] we show , however , that the slopes of the observed surface brightness profile of these clusters are also consistent with the results of simulations of systems without an imbh under a variety of different initial conditions",
