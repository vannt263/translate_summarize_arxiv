    "the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) in the milky way subgroup offer a unique opportunity to investigate galaxy formation and evolution by studying photometric properties of the resolved stellar populations .",
    "since 2005 , more than a dozen new dsphs have been discovered from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the surface brightness of these systems are too low to be identified by the photographic plate and therefore are called ultra faint dwarf ( ufd ) galaxies .",
    "the ufd galaxies are about 10 to 100 times fainter than the classical dsphs , and are even fainter than most of the galactic globular clusters .",
    "they have tidally distorted shapes with quite old stellar populations , and yet are the most dark matter ( dm ) dominated galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic observations have recently revealed that the metallicities of these ufds are lower than luminous dsphs , and the stellar metalliticy distribution functions ( mdfs ) are similar to the metal - poor end of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "these results imply that the galactic halo could have been built from less - luminous satellites similar to these ufds . however , because of faint luminosities and apparently large angular sizes , the general features of ufds , such as the star formation history ( sfh ) and the detailed structural properties , are still unclear .",
    "previous studies have shown that the stellar populations of canes venatici i ( cvn i ) dsph , one of the brightest ufd galaxies , can be divided into a kinematically cold , metal - rich component and a hot , metal - poor one @xcite , while most of ufds show a old and metal - poor population alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the stellar densities of ufds are extremely low , deep photometry is required to reach below the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) to acquire sufficient number of the members for a statistical analysis of structural properties .",
    "the sensitivity , image quality and wide sky coverage are required to probe both global structure and spatially resolved sfh derived directly from the msto .",
    "therefore , we obtained the images of cvn i , botes i ( bo i ) , cane venatici ii ( cvn ii ) , and leo iv dsphs by using the subaru / suprime - cam , that is wide enough to cover the entire areas of the dsphs and deep enough to estimate the stellar ages from the old msto .    in this paper , the data reduction are described in section 2 , and the distances of galaxies are estimated in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and discusses the stellar population of each ufd galaxy .",
    "section 5 shows the spatial distributions and structural properties . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss the population gradients and the age spreads of ufd galaxies , and compare the stellar populations of ufd with those of classical dsphs .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section 7 .",

    "cvn i dsph shows also two kinematically distinct populations @xcite .",
    "this population complexity is similar to those found in the brighter classical dsphs . in general , the brighter galactic satellites have more complex stellar populations than that of the fainter galactic satellites .    two factors could be considered to make this population difference .",
    "the first one is accretion times and the second is potential depths of satellites .",
    "if fainter satellites had been captured by the milky way before they finished star formation , the remains of the gas in the satellites were likely to be removed by the ram - pressure stripping at the accretion . while they could hardly continue star formation after that , other small galaxies kept forming stars and became bright until they lost gas .",
    "furthermore , early accreted satellites had generally experienced a more significant mass loss than those accreted later , so that they became faint @xcite .",
    "this can explain why ufds are composed of only a few old stars , and why brighter dsphs show complex stellar populations .",
    "numerical simulations , however , expect that the locations of early infalling satellites are likely to be closer to the galactic centre than those of later infalling satellites @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "early infalling satellites are expected to be fainter and closer to the milky way as compared with later infalling and brighter satellites .",
    "the real ufds ( @xmath154 ) are widely distributed around the milky way ( 30 - 160kpc ) , and there is no obvious correlation between the stellar population complexities and the current distances of galactic satellites . therefore , whether the early accretion caused progenitors to become present ufds is somewhat controversial .",
    "if we assume that the brighter satellites belonged to the more massive dm halos than those of fainter ones at their initial star formation , the deeper potential made it possible to keep the gas and form the stars for the longer duration , against the suppression effects such as the ram - pressure , tidal stripping , sne feedback , and photo - evaporation by reionization .",
    "therefore , the satellite progenitors in higher - mass halos tended to become brighter dsphs which had more complex stellar populations than those in lower - mass halos .",
    "after accretion , the satellites in lower mass halos should also suffer from stronger tidal effects of the milky way , which could explain the current elongated and distorted shapes of ufds .",
    "the mass estimations of local group dsphs , based on the velocity dispersion profiles of galaxies , revealed that the masses within @xmath61 of dsphs are proportional to the sizes and luminosities @xcite .",
    "this result supports the idea that the population complexity of galactic satellites are mainly due to the difference in the potential depths of progenitors , and the faintness of ufds directly reflect their shallow potentials . in this case ,",
    "star formation in faint ufds , especially at large distances , had not been regulated by galactic tides , but had been regulated by either reionization or sne feedback , or influences of other small galaxies .",
    "from the deep and wide images taken with subaru/ suprime - cam , we demonstrate the single old stellar population of faint ufds , bo i , cvn ii , and leo iv dsphs as well as the population complexity of the relatively bright ufd , cvn i dsph .",
    "we confirm that bo i dsph has no intrinsic colour spread in the width of msto , and no spatial difference in the cmd morphology .",
    "cvn i dsph , on the other hand , shows the relatively younger age ( @xmath0 12.6 gyr ) , and different spatial distributions of bhb and rhb stars , implying the population gradient .",
    "the spatial distributions of bs candidates in ufds reveal that they are not young ms stars but mass - transfer bs stars .",
    "these results indicate that the gases in the ufd progenitors were removed more effectively than the those of brighter dsphs when the initial star formation occurred .",
    "this is reasonable if the progenitors of ufds belong to less massive halos than those of brighter dsphs at that moment .",
    "the wide range of tidal radii and the distorted shapes of ufds also imply that ufds are strongly affected from galactic tides .",
    "we covered the region beyond @xmath117 of cvn ii and leo iv dsphs .",
    "although there are no extra stellar streams nor tidal debris around the galaxies , the radial profiles shows stellar overdensities at the edge of these galaxies .",
    "bo i and cvn i dsphs show elongated morphologies , however , the observed areas are not enough to reveal the real extent .",
    "further wide and deep observations are required to clarify whether the highly elongated ufds have spheroidal shapes or have shapes like stellar streams .",
    "our recent observation of the hercules dsph , which covered the outer region of the galaxy , will provide an answer .",
    "we demonstrate that ufds are composed of old stellar populations .",
    "however it is still unclear which mechanism make such a faint galaxy .",
    "explorations of further faint nearby ufds and isolated distant ufds are crucial to reveal the origin .",
    "leo t dwarf is the only instance of the isolated ufd , so far , and is one of the brightest ufds .",
