    "the length of time with detectable emission is shown for each flare as the red horizontal line on the p@xmath0 light curve in figures  [ fig : evoct ] , [ fig : evnov ] and [ fig : yzfeb ] and given in table  [ tab : targ ] . the total time spent in emission for all three flares observed is 1.4 hours ( out of 48.9 possible hours ) , which corresponds to an ir flare emission duty cycle of 2.8% .",
    "excluding vb 8 , we calculate an ir flare emission duty cycle of 3.1% ( of 44.3 hours ) for active mid - m dwarfs .",

    ". the ratios of the paschen series lines and brackett @xmath1 to each other are relatively constant throughout the flare , and those ratios are well produced in every atmospheric structure .",
    "the ratio of the paschen lines and br@xmath1 to h@xmath1 , however , is matched only in the models with a log(col mass)@xmath31 = 0 . because these lines are sensitive to the hottest regions of the chromosphere , the advantage of the log(col mass)@xmath31 = 0 is likely an increased amount of material at temperatures near t = @xmath36k due to a shallower slope in the chromosphere .",
    "the ratio of ca ii k to h@xmath1 and to the other hydrogen series lines is best produced in the models with the deepest t@xmath41 , a deep transition region ( log(col mass)@xmath30 = -3.5 or -4.5 ) , and a hot t@xmath30 = @xmath40k or @xmath37k . in all other models , ca ii k is underproduced relative to the paschen series lines .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : hgtfor ] , the ca ii k emission in the best - fit model is formed over a larger range of log(col mass ) than any other line .",
    "the production of ca ii k in a region that includes the upper chromosphere is unusual compared to previous results ; typically , ca ii k emission during a flare is thought to last longer because it is a lower temperature line @xcite .",
    "our cooler atmospheres , where ca ii k emission is formed only in lower temperature regions , do not produce enough ca ii k emission relative to paschen series emission to match our observations .",

    "its observed ratio compared to h@xmath1 increases from 0.1 to 0.5 , while all our models show line flux ratios of 0.1 or less .",
    "this mismatch is apparently worse in the one of the other two flares observed ; as discussed in section  [ sec : flareall ] , he i @xmath210830  is stronger compared to p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 ( the two other lines observed ) in the ut 2010 november 27 flare on ev lac . simply raising the t@xmath30 in our models produces too much ca ii k but",
    "no additional he i @xmath210830 . in the sun and similar stars , he i",
    "@xmath210830  emission is produced in the upper chromosphere during flares as a result of helium ionization via backwarming from coronal uv flux @xcite .",
    "a similar process could be leading to the he i @xmath210830  emission during m dwarf flares , but the details of backwarming from coronal emission are not yet fully implemented in the rh atmosphere code .",
    "while one - dimensional atmosphere models can match the line flux ratios of most of the lines as a sequence of static snapshots , they can not reproduce the time evolution of the flare .",
    "in our observations , ca ii k , the paschen lines , br@xmath1 , and he i @xmath210380  all rise relative to h@xmath1 during the decay phase of the flare .",
    "the best fitting models in our suite of atmospheres indicate an increase in ca ii k is always coupled with a decrease of the paschen and brackett lines .",
    "the time evolution of flares may involve different atmospheric components covering the surface of the star with changing filling factors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that a linear combination of two or three different one - dimensional atmospheres with changing filling factors would reproduce the time - evolution of this flare .",
    "during nearly 50 hours of simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations on 4 active m dwarfs , we saw 16 total flares , 3 of them with accompanying infrared emission lines .",
    "the strongest flare ( @xmath3 = 4.02 ) occurred on ev lac on ut 2009 october 27 .",
    "it showed emission from h@xmath1 , h@xmath4 , he i @xmath24471 , ca ii k , p@xmath0 , p@xmath1 , p@xmath4 , br@xmath1 , and he i @xmath210830",
    ". a weaker flare ( @xmath3 = 1.68 ) on ev lac on ut 2010 november 27 showed only emission from p@xmath0 , p@xmath1 , and he i @xmath210830 .",
    "remarkably , the he i @xmath210830  emission was twice as strong compared to p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 as it was in the @xmath3 = 4.02 flare . the weakest flare with infrared emission ( @xmath5 = 1.38 ) occurred on yz cmi on ut 2011 february 14 ; p@xmath0 , p@xmath1 , and he i @xmath210830  were just above their detection limits .",
    "we estimate a duty cycle of 2.8% to 4.6% for observing the strongest infrared emission line ( p@xmath0 ) during flares on active mid - m dwarfs .",
    "these observations confirm that flares are detectable in the infrared portion of m dwarf spectra , which is much brighter in quiescence than the bluer portions of m dwarf spectra which are typically used to detect flares .    using a hotter chromosphere than previous one - dimensional static flare models ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ratios of ca ii k , he i @xmath24471 , h@xmath4 , the paschen lines , and br@xmath1 to h@xmath1 can be relatively well reproduced .",
    "the generation of ca ii k in the hot , upper portion of the atmosphere is distinct from previous results , and is necessary to produce more ca ii k than paschen series emission , which is observed during our strongest flare .",
    "this result confirms that infrared emission is a useful constraint on the atmospheric heating during m dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the strength of emission from he i @xmath210830  is not predicted from our one - dimensional model , but including a detailed treatment of backwarming from the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be warranted , based on solar results .",
    "modeling he i @xmath210830  is also complicated by its different emission strengths compared to p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 in the two flares on ev lac , but these differences show that he i @xmath210830  has potential to constrain different backwarming scenarios during a variety of flares .",
    "the time - evolution of the largest flare is not reproduced by our one - dimensional models , but a combination of multiple models with different filling factors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or detailed radiative hydrodynamic modeling with non - thermal beam heating ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) may provide a better match to the flare emission .",
