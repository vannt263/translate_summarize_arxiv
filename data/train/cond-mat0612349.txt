    "<S> the value of @xmath4 depends on @xmath3 but does not depend on @xmath69 at chosen parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; i.e. , the creation of the same mode in the stacks with different @xmath69 leads to the same value of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> so we may predict a different commensurability manifestation in the ivc of stacks with a different number of ijj . </S>",
    "<S> this is a generalization of the commensurability effect we have observed in ref . at small @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    as summary </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that coupling between junctions changes crucially the dependence of the return current on a dissipation parameter . </S>",
