    "the first reason is that the cp violation from the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism @xcite , which nicely explains cp violation in k- and b - systems , is highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "the second reason is that the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is not strongly first order .",
    "the experimental lower bound on the higgs mass , @xmath0 gev @xcite , implies that there is no ewpt in the sm @xcite .",

    "<S> in models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking due to strongly coupled fourth - family quarks and leptons , their low - energy effective descriptions may involve multiple composite higgs fields , leading to a possibility that the electroweak phase transition at finite temperature is first order due to the coleman - weinberg mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the behavior of the electroweak phase transition based on the effective renormalizable yukawa theory which consists of the fourth - family quarks and two su(2)-doublet higgs fields corresponding to the bilinear operators of the fourth - family quarks with / without imposing the compositeness condition . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the first - order phase transition is estimated by using the finite - temperature effective potential at one - loop with the ring - improvement . in the yukawa theory without the compositeness condition , it is found that there is a parameter region where the first - order phase transition is strong enough for the electroweak baryogenesis with the experimentally acceptable higgs boson and fourth - family quark masses . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when the compositeness condition is imposed , the phase transition turns out to be weakly first order , or possibly second order , although the result is rather sensitive to the details of the compositeness condition . combining with the result of the yukawa theory without the compositeness condition , </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that with the fourth - family quark masses in the range of 330 - 480 gev , corresponding to the compositeness scale in the range of 1.0 - 2.3 tev , the four - fermion interaction among the fourth - family quarks does not lead to the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition . </S>"
