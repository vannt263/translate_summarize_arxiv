    "the accreted stellar halo ( ash ) of a galaxy represents a record of the accretion history of the galaxy itself .",
    "its assembly is determined by a large number of free parameters , including the structural properties of each accreted satellite ( virial mass , concentration , stellar content , morphology ) , the orbital properties of each accretion event ( energy and angular momentum at infall ) , the structural properties of the host itself during accretion .",
    "this implies a significant degree of stochasticity , as shown by the observed halo - to - halo scatter ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2014 ) and by the dichotomy between the ` broken ' and sharply declining density profile of the stellar halo of the milky way ( e.g. , deason et al .",
    "2013 ) and the more extended halo of andromeda , whose density profile is well described by a single power - law ( e.g. , gilbert et al .",
    "2012 , ibata et al .",
    "in amorisco ( 2015 ) i have isolated the main ingredients that shape the contribution of each accreted satellite to the ash .",
    "i adopted a simplified approach and assumed that the contributing dwarfs are dark matter dominated ( as expected for the case of an @xmath1 host ) and ignored the gravitational influence of the host s disk .",
    "combined with the halo mass - concentration relation ( e.g. , gao et al .",
    "2008 , ludlow et al .",
    "2014 ) , this reduces the structural properties of each minor merger to two dimensionless parameters .",
    "two additional parameters characterise the orbital properties of the satellite at accretion ( e.g. , benson 2005 , jiang et al .",
    "the locus of this parameter space that is relevant to a @xmath0cdm cosmology is explored with a library of minor merger n - body simulations , in which stars are assigned to the most bound 5@xmath2 of the satellite s particles , using a standard particle tagging technique ( e.g. , bullock & johnston 2005 , cooper et al .",
    "this study shows that dynamical friction is a major player in shaping stellar deposition , allowing only the most massive ( and/or concentrated ) accreted satellites to deposit their stars in the innermost regions of the host .",
    "orbital radialisation by dynamical friction causes the stellar populations deposited by such most massive accretion events ( virial satellite - to - host mass ratio at accretion @xmath3 ) to bear little memory of the details of the orbital properties of the progenitor at infall .",

    "panel c ) : the spherically averaged density profiles of the 150 accreted stellar haloes corresponding to the accretion histories of panel a ) , color - coding refers to the local mass - weighed virial satellite - to - host mass .",
    "panel e ) : the correlation between the total accreted stellar mass in the halo and the number of main accretion events ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "i use the library just described to assemble 500 ashs , for galaxies that share a virial mass of @xmath5 .",
    "i use monte carlo generated accretion histories ( fakhouri et al .",
    "2010 ) , 150 of which are displayed in _ panel a ) _ of fig .  1 , color - coded by the total accreted stellar mass .",
    "satellite stellar masses are assigned based on a redshift - independent abundance matching relation ( garrison - kimmel et al .",
    "2014 , 0.3 dex scatter ) .",
    "_ panels b ) _ and _ c ) _ exemplify the assembly of an individual ash : each accreted and disrupted satellite ( color - coded by its accretion redshift ) is associated to the spherically averaged density profile of the stars it deposits in the halo .",
    "these are retrieved from the library using the relevant time - interval between accretion and @xmath6 , and are re - scaled to physical quantities according to the dimensional properties of the merger at hand .",
    "_ panel d ) _ displays the spherically averaged density profiles of 150 ashs built in this manner . at each radius , the halo - to - halo scatter approaches 2 dex , and increases at @xmath7 , together with an increasing amount of not fully phase - mixed substructure from recent accretion events .",
    "although with a significant scatter , on average , ashs share a logarithmic density slope @xmath8 within 20  kpc , and become steeper with radius , as shown by the dashed guiding lines .",
    "the details of this steepening are highly variable : some profiles have marked and sharp breaks , others ` roll ' gently towards steeper and steeper slopes , other remain comparatively shallower .",
    "the radii where such transitions take place are equally variable . the color - coding in _",
    "panel d ) _ indicates the local mass - weighted satellite - to - host virial mass ratio . on average , the innermost regions of the ash",
    "are contributed by satellites that have larger virial mass ratios at accretion .",
    "this gradient has been observed in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( rodriguez - gomez et al .",
    "2016 ) and i conclude is a direct consequence of dynamical friction ( e.g. , amorisco 2015 ) .",
    "color - coding in _",
    "panel d ) _ reveals that the local mean virial mass ratio also correlates positively with the local density .",
    "_ panel e ) _ confirms this link by showing a scatter plot of the total accreted stellar mass of the ash against the ` number of main accretion events ' @xmath9 ( i.e. the ratio between the total accreted stellar mass of the ash and the mean stellar mass of the contributing satellites , mass - weighted by stellar mass itself ) . the most massive ashs result from the accretion of just one / two particularly massive satellites , which dominate the ex - situ mass .",
    "although this technique represents a highly simplified approach , it allows for an efficient exploration of the significant stochasticity of ashs .",
    "physical ingredients that are neglected here ( the host s stellar disk , the morphologies of the accreted dwarfs , any post - accretion star formation etc . ) will result in even increased variability .",
    "detailed analysis of a large sample of ashs concentrating on the systematic correlations that connect density profile and accretion history is the subject of a forthcoming work ( amorisco 2016 ) ."
