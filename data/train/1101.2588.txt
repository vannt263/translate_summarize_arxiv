    "@xmath0  cep is a nearby ( @xmath3  pc ) , bright ( @xmath4 ) k1 iv - iii star , that has the distinction to be the very first candidate for an extrasolar planetary companion detected by precise rv measurements that was discussed in the literature .",
    "the pioneering rv survey at the cfht carried out by bruce campbell and gordon walker discovered that @xmath0  cep is not only a single - lined binary , but also that it shows periodic low - amplitude rv variations that might indicate the presence of a giant planetary companion with a period around 900  days ( campbell et al .  1988 ) . however , the same team later cast doubt on the existence of this planet ( walker et al .",
    "they argued that this signal could be caused by intrinsic variability of the star itself .",
    "more recently , hatzes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used over 14 years of precise rv data obtained by the mcdonald observatory planet search to demonstrate that the 900  d signal stayed coherent in phase and amplitude of the entire time span .",
    "we also showed that there is no significant variability in the chromospheric emission level and line bisectors based on the mcdonald spectra of @xmath0  cep .",
    "we concluded that the 900  d signal is indeed due to a planetary companion with a minimum mass of 1.7  m@xmath2 orbiting at @xmath5  au .",
    "the detection of this planet in a relatively tight binary system with @xmath1  au lead to a host of follow - up investigations ranging from dynamical studies ( e.g. dvorak et al .",
    "2003 , haghighipour  2006 ) , to planet formation modeling ( e.g. kley & nelson  2008 , jang - condell et al .",
    "2008 ) , to additional work combining existing rv data with astrometric measurements ( torres 2007 ) , and to direct imaging campaigns ( neuhuser et al .",
    "in particular the combination of the last two papers significantly improved the parameters of the @xmath0  cep stellar binary system .",
    "the orbital period of the binary is @xmath6 years with an eccentricity of @xmath7 and a semi - major axis of @xmath8  au .",
    "the primary has a mass of m@xmath9  m@xmath10 and the secondary is an m dwarf with m@xmath11  m@xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we present our results based on additional eight years of precise rv measurements from the planet search program at the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope ( hjst ) and its tull cude spectrograph at mcdonald observatory .",
    "cep  a. the four different data sets are from the cfht ( triangles ) and from the 3 different phases of the mcdonald observatory planet search ( circles , diamonds , filled circles ) . the solid line displays the rv orbit due to the stellar secondary . ]    after the announcement of the planet in 2003 , we have continued to observe @xmath0  cep as part of the long - term precise doppler survey at the hjst .",
    "we are currently in phase iii of the program that utilizes the entire available spectral bandwidth of the iodine cell that we use to measure precise differential rvs .",
    "phase i and ii used either different reference lines ( e.g. telluric lines ) or instrumental configurations . a detailed description of the different phases of our program can be found in hatzes et al .",
    "figure 1 displays the entire rv data starting with the cfht results and ending with the mcd phase iii .",
    "these data cover the periastron passage of the binary orbit ( solid line ) . with these new data in hand , we can confirm or falsify the planetary hypothesis by testing if the residual signal stayed constant in period , phase and amplitude .",
    "fig.2 shows the lomb - scargle periodogram of the rv residuals after subtracting the large binary motion .",
    "the 900  d signal is clearly present in our data and its statistical significance is higher than in 2003 .",
    "the false - alarm - probability of the peak is @xmath12 .",
    "our phase iii spectra contain the ca ii h&k lines that can be used as proxies for magnetic activity of the star .",
    "we determine a ca line s - index that corresponds to the level of chromospheric emission in the ca h & k line cores .",
    "if any correlation between the s - indices and the rv data is found it would cast serious doubt on the existence of a companion .",
    "fig.3 contains the periodogram of our s - index measurements .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicates the 900  d period for the planet .",
    "it shows that there is no isolated peak at the orbital period , further strengthening the case for the planet .",
    "however , there is a peak of moderate power at a significantly shorter period of @xmath13  d. although not highly significant , this peak could indicate the rotational period of the star .",
    "our re - analysis of the cfht fwhm measurements in hatzes et al . also revealed a shorter period that can be the stellar rotational period .",
    "we conclude that the addition of the new data strongly confirms the presence of the 900  d signal residual signal and that there appears to be no connection between this signal and intrinsic variability of the host star .",
    "we derived a simultaneous keplerian orbital solution for both the binary and the planetary orbit using _ gaussfit _ ( jefferys et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the rv offsets between the four individual data sets were included as fit parameters .",
    "the only parameter that we held fixed is the period of the binary .",
    "we used 24650 days , the current best value following torres ( 2007 ) and neuhuser et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . letting this parameter vary freely lead to shorter binary periods , which are inconsistent with the global solution based on historic low precision rvs and imaging results . despite that the 30  years of precise rvs cover the periastron passage and almost half of the entire orbit",
    ", it is not sufficient to derive the correct binary period using these data alone .",
    "the remaining orbital parameters for the binary are in good agreement with the published values : k@xmath14ms@xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and t@xmath18  days .",
    "the updated parameters for the planet are given in table  1 .",
    "the biggest difference to the previously published values are a higher minimum mass of @xmath19m@xmath2 ( previously @xmath20m@xmath2 ) and a lower eccentricity of @xmath21 ( previously @xmath22 ) .",
    "fig.4 shows the 4 different rv data sets ( after subtracting the binary motion ) along with the planetary orbit phased to the 900  d period .",
    "the residual rv scatter of @xmath24ms@xmath15 is more than twice as large as the internal measurement uncertainties of 3ms@xmath15 for the mcdonald phase iii data .",
    "this excess scatter could be a sign of additional , previously undetected planets in the system . based on dynamical simulations",
    ", haghighipour  ( 2006 ) showed that low - mass planets with @xmath25  au should remain stable in this system .",
    "however , a period search in the residuals to our binary plus single planet fit did not ( yet ) reveal any significant signals ( see fig.5 ) .      in september 2007 we used seven consecutive nights at the hjst to perform an intensive asteroseismological study of @xmath0  cep  a. we collected over 1200 individual rv measurements and discovered that the star is a low - amplitude multi - periodic pulsator .",
    "the results of this observing run are described in more detail in endl et al .",
    "we identified 12 different frequencies with amplitudes ranging from 1.5 to 4.1ms@xmath15 .",
    "a section of one night from this campaign is displayed in fig.6 .",
    "the oscillation spectrum of @xmath0  cep  a has a large spacing of 15@xmath26hz , which is proportional to the mass and radius of the star . using a mass of 1.4m@xmath10 we derive a radius of 4.9  r@xmath10 .",
    "this value is right in between the two interferometrically measured radius values of @xmath27  r@xmath10 ( nordgren et al .",
    "1999 ) and @xmath28  r@xmath10 ( baines et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath0  cep  a are the cause of the observed excess scatter .",
    "although we have currently no evidence for additional planets in the system , such a search is limited by the short - term variability due to the pulsations . to account for this additional rv signal in our data ,",
    "we have increased the error bars on our phase iii data artificially by a factor of two before performing the orbital fits presented in this paper .",
    "otherwise , the small formal errors of the phase iii data , which do not take the oscillations into account , would have severely underestimated the true uncertainties of these data .",
    "the pulsation signal of a few ms@xmath15 is present in the entire rv data set and it limits our ability to search for lower - mass planets that would produce rv signals with similar amplitudes .",
    "the exposures times for a bright star like @xmath0  cep are short enough so that we sampled these pulsations at random phases , rather than average them out . therefore , as the next step",
    ", we plan to define and subtract the oscillation signal from the entire 30 years of rv data .",
    "this should allow us to reach the highest sensitivity for additional planets in the @xmath0  cep system .",
    "we would like to thank the many observers of the mcdonald observatory planet search program at the hjst that have obtained spectra of @xmath0  cep over the years : phillip j. macqueen , stuart i. barnes , diane paulson , paul robsertson , erik brugamyer and candace gray .",
    "jacob bean and brbara castanheira helped with the seismology campaign on this star .",
    "we are grateful to bruce campbell , gordon a. h. walker and stephenson yang for their cfht data .",
