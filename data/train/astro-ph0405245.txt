    "van maanen s star , also known as van maanen 2 was discovered in 1917 by adrian van maanen @xcite .",
    "its discovery was quite accidental , as van maanen was searching for common proper motion companions to hd4628 ( lalande 1299 ) and noticed the even larger proper motion of a nearby star . at 4.4 pc ,",
    "van maanen 2 is the nearest single white dwarf @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the astrometric detection of a substellar companion to van maanen 2 through analysis of _ hipparcos _ data .",
    "the data suggested an orbital solution with a lower bound companion mass of @xmath8 , a period of 1.57 yr , and a maximum separation on the sky of @xmath9 .",
    "based on the published parameters , a binary orbital calculator ( a. ghez 2004 , private communication ) indicated a separation of @xmath10 at position angle @xmath11 near the middle of january 2004 .",
    "this paper presents the results of a direct imaging search carried out during that time frame .",
    "van maanen 2 was observed using the facility adaptive optics system @xcite and the nirc2 camera at keck observatory on 12 jaunuary 2004 .",
    "five dithered images were obtained through an @xmath12 ( @xmath13 m ) filter . to reduce thermal backgrounds and provide a more symmetric psf ,",
    "a circular pupil stop was used which describes an inscribed circle on the hexagonal keck primary , with a diameter of @xmath14 meters .",
    "each image consisted of 100 coadds of 0.4 seconds each .",
    "van maanen 2 itself was used as the guide star , with the adaptive optics system running at a rate of 80 hz .",
    "the correction was quite good , with a strehl ratio ( measured relative to the psf of the 9 meter pupil ) of 0.75 and a full width at half maximum of @xmath15 , essentially diffraction limited .",
    "the plate scale was @xmath16 per pixel .",
    "the adaptive optics images were reduced using standard programs in the iraf environment . for a given raw image ,",
    "the sky was extracted by taking the median of the four remaining dithered images with rejection of hot and cold pixels .",
    "a flat frame was created by averaging all five sky frames and subsequently normalizing .",
    "each dithered frame was then sky subtracted , flat fielded , and the resulting five frames were registered and averaged .    due to the uncertainties in the wings of the adaptive optics psf and weather that was not photometric , it was difficult to perform photometry on the keck data .",
    "therefore photometric observations of van maanen 2 were acquired at the irtf .      @xmath1 m data on van maanen 2 and two standard stars were acquired on 1 february 2004 by alan stockton at the 3 meter nasa infrared telescope facility with nsfcam @xcite .",
    "for the standards , a 9 point dither pattern was used with each frame consisting of 0.15 second exposure times 100 coadds  yielding a total integration time of 135 seconds .",
    "the ukirt faint standard sa92 - 342 ( @xmath17 mag ) was observed immediately before van maanen 2 and the elias standard star hd22686 ( @xmath18 mag ) was observed immediately afterward @xcite .",
    "two sets of images , acquired in the same manner as the standards , were obtained for van maanen 2 for a total of 18 frames and 270 seconds integration .",
    "conditions during the observations were reported as photometric .",
    "the data on the two standards were reduced using standard programs in the iraf environment . for a given raw image ,",
    "the sky was extracted by taking the median of the eight remaining dithered images with rejection of hot and cold pixels .",
    "a flat frame was created by averaging all nine sky frames and subsequently normalizing .",
    "each dithered frame was then sky subtracted , flat fielded , and the resulting nine frames were registered and averaged . reducing the two sets of images on van maanen 2 was more difficult due to the faintness of the target in each raw frame .",
    "it was found that the target was more easily seen in pairwise subtracted images rather than in sky subtracted images .",
    "all 18 pairwise subtracted frames were flat fielded , registered and averaged , creating one final image for photometric measurements .",
    "the flux of both standards was measured with aperture radii of @xmath19 and @xmath20 and corrected for extinction .",
    "the error in determining the zero point was 0.03 mag .",
    "van maanen 2 was measured in the smaller aperture to minimize noise , corrected to the larger aperture ( with an error of 0.04 mag ) and extinction corrected .",
    "this yielded a signal to noise of 48 and a measurement error of 0.03 mag .",
    "the photometric measurement including all errors was @xmath21 mag for van maanen 2 .",
    "isocam observations of van maanen 2 were carried out in 1997 in an effort to provide observational constraints on the origin of metals in the photospheres of cool white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "data were taken at @xmath5 m and @xmath22 m on van maanen 2 and several other white dwarfs as well as an a0v calibrator star .",
    "the data are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "in order to estimate the brightness of the reported companion , a model for a @xmath3 brown dwarf at 5 gyr was chosen .",
    "this mass lies conservatively in the lower range of possible values and required no interpolation within available models .",
    "the model age is likely to be greater than the 3.67 gyr cooling age @xcite of van maanen 2 plus the @xmath23 gyr main sequence lifetime @xcite for a @xmath24 progenitor of the @xmath25 white dwarf @xcite .",
    "a substellar companion of this mass and age would be a late t dwarf ( @xmath26 k ) and have @xmath27 mag which is @xmath28 mag at 4.4 pc @xcite .",
    "photometric @xmath12 band data on known brown dwarfs do exist and the measurements agree with the models used here to within 0.3 mag for spectral type t6 @xcite .",
    "van maanen 2 is predicted to have @xmath29 mag based on the model predicted @xmath30 color of a 6750 k helium white dwarf @xcite and the @xmath31 color of a 6750 k blackbody .",
    "@xmath32 is the measured color  the extrapolation was done from @xmath33 in case of any contamination by a companion at @xmath34 .",
    "the reduced @xmath12 image ( figure [ fig1 ] ) shows no indication whatsoever of a companion with the brightness expected from a brown dwarf of the type reported by @xcite . from the published orbital parameters , the companion should have been at a separation of @xmath10 and position angle of @xmath11 on the date of the observation",
    "the full width at half maximum of van maanen 2 in the reduced image is @xmath15 and the distance to the first airy ring is @xmath35 .",
    "there are two extremely faint features within the airy ring at position angles of 284 and @xmath36 .",
    "small aperture flux measurements , relative to the primary , at eight different evenly spaced locations around the airy ring indicate that these features are unlikely to be real . the flux at 284 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and 0.073 respectively , are both within @xmath38 ( 0.018 ) of the average flux ( @xmath39 ) in the ring and are almost certainly artifacts due to imperfect optical guide star corrections . if the feature at @xmath36 were real , its brightness after subtracting the flux of the primary in the airy ring implies @xmath40 mag and a mass of @xmath41 , assuming an age of 5 gyr @xcite .",
    "this is simply not massive enough to cause the reported astrometric wobble .",
    "an artificial star was planted at @xmath10 from the primary in order to test the ability to detect faint companions at this separation .",
    "the adaptive optics psf , extracted from the reduced image of van maanen 2 , was used for the stellar profile of the planted star . to be conservative , this artificial star is a full 2.0 magnitudes fainter than the white dwarf  this was confirmed by placing the star at many positions on the image and measuring its flux without contamination by the primary .",
    "the simulated star is readily seen in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "large errors in the reported orbital parameters allow for the possibility that the companion remained unresolved due to chance alignment during the observation .",
    "the values and computed errors in separation and position angle , derived from the binary orbital calculator , are @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "hence the putative companion could have been located at almost any position in its orbit by the epoch of the observation",
    ". however , there is further evidence against this possibility .",
    "in the case of a chance alignment , any substellar companion would still cause excess emission at mid infrared wavelengths .",
    "this is primarily due to the size difference between brown dwarfs and white dwarfs ; a ratio of 10:1 in radius .",
    "it is not possible for a significant occultation to occur . at most ,",
    "a white dwarf could block only @xmath44% of the light from an orbiting brown dwarf .",
    "as mentioned above , a value of @xmath21 mag was measured for van maanen 2 .",
    "this is to be compared with the value predicted for a 6750 k white dwarf , @xmath29 mag .",
    "the combined flux of the white dwarf plus a @xmath3 brown dwarf at 5 gyr would have a magnitude of @xmath45 mag .",
    "hence it is concluded there is no excess emission at this wavelength .",
    "furthermore , the published _ iso _",
    "observations place even stronger constraints on the absence of flux from a brown dwarf around van maanen 2 .",
    "a recent model @xcite of the flux from a 5 gyr , @xmath46 brown dwarf was integrated over the _ iso _ @xmath22 m filter lw3 .",
    "this results in a flux of about 1.0mjy in this filter .",
    "the reported measurement taken at van maanen 2 in 1997 was @xmath47 mjy .",
    "this measurement is consistent with photospheric flux from the white dwarf and an _ excess _ of @xmath48 most likely would have been detected .",
    "if the _ iso _ results are correct and the models are right , any companion with @xmath49 k is ruled out ",
    "this includes 10 gyr old brown dwarfs with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] summarizes all existing photometric data on van maanen 2 and the corresponding fluxes are plotted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "it should be clear from the figure that the measured fluxes are all consistent with a single white dwarf with a temperature around 6800 k.",
    "three compelling infrared observations of van maanen 2 are presented which rule out the presence of a substellar companion warmer than @xmath51 k. first , @xmath1 m adaptive optics images reveal no significant flux at the predicted magnitude and position of the putative companion reported by @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath1 m photometric observations are consistent with no excess emission at this wavelength as would be expected from a @xmath52 brown dwarf at 5 gyr . and third , @xmath22 m data also are consistent with no excess emission , ruling out any possible companion massive enough to induce the reported astrometric wobble .",
