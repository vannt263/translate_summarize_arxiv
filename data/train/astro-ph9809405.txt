    "the chemical composition of the solar system is now known with a high accuracy from the spectroscopic studies of the solar photosphere as well as from the analysis of the carbonaceous chondrites ( anders and grevesse @xcite , grevesse et al .",
    "moreover , theoretical models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis allow the identification of the most likely sites and mechanisms for the formation of the chemical elements . combining them with simple models for the chemical evolution of the galaxy",
    ", one can reproduce reasonably well the solar system abundances .",
    "however , the solar system only provides a single data point , both in the time evolution of the galaxy and in the spatial distribution in the disk .",
    "it is thus important to gather additional data in order to have an insight of the chemical composition of the interstellar matter at different epochs since the formation of the galaxy .",
    "as time goes by , more and more metals are synthesized in the stellar interiors and ejected in the surrounding environment , so that the overall metallicity slowly increases .",
    "although the correlation of metallicity with time is not a perfect one , unevolved metal - poor stars give a picture of the chemical conditions at earlier phases of the galactic evolution .    up to now , spectroscopic analyses of metal - poor stars have essentially consisted in determining abundance ratios as a function of metallicity .",
    "these ratios are supposed to show the evolution of the nucleosynthetic processes with time .",
    "unfortunately , these results generally show a rather large scatter , which is either of cosmic origin or due to observational uncertainties . in the latter case , this prevents any meaningful comparison with the theoretical models . on the other hand ,",
    "if the scatter reflects an intrinsic cosmic dispersion , it should be accounted for in the models .    in order to find the origin of that scatter",
    ", we must improve the accuracy of the abundances .",
    "this requires both high quality data and a careful spectroscopic analysis .    here",
    ", we report on the results of such a detailed analysis and we investigate the underlying reasons for the remaining scatter  if any .",
    "we look at correlations between different abundance ratios at a given metallicity .",
    "strongly correlated elements are likely to have been processed in the same astrophysical sites .",
    "therefore , the identification of such correlations can provide fruitful insights on the nucleosynthesis of these elements .",
    "this allows us to suggest a scenario for the formation of metal - poor stars .",
    "preliminary results have already been presented briefly in jehin et al .",
    ".basic photometric data [ cols=\">,>,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the heavy @xmath2-process elements ba , la and ce have been considered together in fig .   9 since the available spectroscopic data were of slightly lower quality .",
    "despite the larger scatter , these elements all follow the same trend . once again , we can distinguish two groups of stars , the first one with variable [ ti / fe ] and a second vertical one at the maximum value of this abundance ratio .",
    "the slope for the first group of stars is not as well defined as in the case of the lighter @xmath2 elements .",
    "this may be due to the lower quality of the data , but might also reflect a different nucleosynthetic history .",
    "the latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that at least one of the anomalous stars , which perfectly fits in the light @xmath2 diagrams , now shows up again as overenriched in heavier @xmath2 elements .",
    "the cases of nd and sm are illustrated in fig .",
    "these elements , formed by both neutron capture processes in the solar system , display a pattern intermediate between those of the @xmath0-process element eu and the heavy @xmath2-process ones . for low values of [ ti / fe ] ,",
    "[ nd / fe ] and [ sm / fe ] are roughly constant , except for the two anomalous stars , which are relatively enriched . near the maximum value of [ ti / fe ] , a looser clumping appears , with a dispersion which is intermediate between those of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 elements .    as we have seen earlier , the two stars hd193901 and hd194598 represented by open symbols in the correlation diagrams , display a number of abundance anomalies : a lower ni abundance ( fig .",
    "5b ) , a probable overabundance in heavy @xmath2-process elements ( fig .   9 ) and , above all , a higher abundance in @xmath0-process products ( figs .",
    "7b , 10 ) .",
    "if , as stated by anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) , ni is the even iron peak element with the smallest contribution from explosive nucleosynthesis , this behaviour might be explained by a different nucleosynthetic history , namely an enhanced contribution from explosive processes compared to equilibrium ones .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm",
    "the kinematical data are summarized in table 9 .",
    "the radial velocities were selected from several sources : barbier - brossat et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , wilson ( @xcite ) , evans ( @xcite ) , gratton and sneden ( @xcite ) , lindgren and andersen ( private communications ) .",
    "the radial velocities are known to about @xmath4kms@xmath5 for most of the stars .",
    "the proper motions and parallaxes used to calculate the galactic velocities were taken from the hipparcos catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of the galactic space velocities u , v and w with respect to the lsr is based on the method presented in johnson and soderblom ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corrections applied to the observed velocities for the solar motion are ( -10.4,+14.8,+7.3 ) kms@xmath5 in ( u , v , w ) ( mihalas and routly 1968 ) .    upon examination of table 9 , our sample appears to contain thick disk and halo stars .",
    "however , there is no clear distinction between these two populations in figs .  7a , 8 and 9 , since thick disk stars are found on both branches in these plots .",
    "this result seems to disagree with the analysis of nissen and schuster ( 1997 , ns ) , who have selected two samples of stars on the basis of their kinematical properties and covering about the same metallicity range as ours .",
    "while their halo stars are indeed found in both branches of our diagram , all their disk stars display maximum [ @xmath1/fe ] values .",
    "some of our disk stars undoubtedly have low [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "the apparent disagreement might be due to the fact that both samples contain a relatively small number of stars and that , by accident , all disk stars selected by ns have a high [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "it may be of interest to note that the two stars which seem to display some anomalous abundances are just these which have the most halo - like kinematic properties .",
    "however , it is difficult to conclude on the basis of only two stars .",
    "we plan to extend the analysis to other metal - poor stars with kinematics more typical of the halo .",
    "the analysis of the correlations between the relative abundances of a number of elements for stars with roughly 0.1 of the solar metallicity leads us to distinguish between two stellar populations , corresponding to distinct branches in the diagram ( e.g.   fig .",
    "7a ) : ( a ) a fraction of the stars have a range of moderate overabundances of the @xmath1-elements and either a constant or slowly varying abundance of the @xmath2-process elements relative to the iron peak , and ( b ) the others show a constant ( and maximum ) overabundance of the @xmath1-elements relative to the iron - peak elements , and a range in @xmath2-process abundances .",
    "this behaviour must be related to nucleosynthesis processes .    since",
    "our sample contains a limited number of stars , its astrophysical significance may be checked by including the results of other analyses . in fig .",
    "11 , we have added the ns stars as well as the sample of zhao and magain ( 1991 , zm ) .",
    "the quality of those data is almost as good as the quality of the data presented here .",
    "the zm data extend our sample towards stars of lower metallicity . the stars in fig .",
    "11 have metallicities @xmath6 [ fe / h ] @xmath7 .",
    "the zero points have been fixed by comparing the results obtained for the stars in common ( 3 with ns , 10 with zm ) , for which we have kept the results obtained here with a more precise analysis .",
    "we see that all these metal - poor stars follow the same trend , independently of their metallicity .",
    "= 8.5 cm    as our metallicity range for ( thick ) disk stars is rather limited towards metal - poor stars , we have added in fig .",
    "12 the data obtained by edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for disk stars of various metallicities .",
    "the difference in zero - points between the two analyses has been corrected on the basis of 10 stars in common .",
    "we see that these disk stars definitely _ do not _ follow the relation obtained for metal - poor stars , but scatter mostly through the upper left part of the diagram .",
    "taking into account the larger error bars in edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) data , our metal - poor stars define the lower right envelope of this domain .",
    "this envelope also contains the lowest metallicity stars of edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    on the basis of these two comparisons , a cutoff in metallicity at [ fe / h ] @xmath8 seems to emerge . for stars of higher metallicity",
    ", the _ two branches diagram _ does not apply .",
    "lower metallicity stars follow a universal relation described by the _ two branches diagram_. we shall refer to the slowly varying branch stars as population iia and to the vertical branch as population iib .",
    "we now briefly describe a possible scenario for the formation and origin of these metal - poor stars , which provides an explanation for the universal relation described above .",
    "this scenario will be developed in more details in a forthcoming paper .",
    "it takes place in the early stages of the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "we distinguish two separate phases in the evolution of the metal - poor stars .",
    "_ phase 1 _    at first , we assume that there is a burst of star formation , consisting essentially of massive stars . as these stars evolve and become supernovae ( sne ) , @xmath1-elements and @xmath0-process elements",
    "are formed and then ejected in the surrounding interstellar matter ( ism ) .",
    "new stars are formed from this ism , which is enriched in those @xmath1 and @xmath0-process elements .",
    "these stars correspond to pop iia .",
    "_ phase 2 _    as time goes on , the lower mass stars are either still contracting towards the main sequence or have reached a more evolved phase , maybe already processing @xmath2 elements .",
    "these evolved stars are known to have strong stellar winds and to undergo superwind events .",
    "the newly formed @xmath2 elements are thus ejected into the surrounding ism , previously enriched in @xmath1- and @xmath0-process elements .",
    "new born stars formed from this ism will keep a constant value for [ @xmath1/fe ] but will be enriched in @xmath2 elements .",
    "they will belong to pop iib .",
    "another possibility is that already formed lower mass stars can accrete gas from the @xmath2-process enriched winds . in this case",
    ", the @xmath2-process enrichment will show up in the external layers only , at least if the convective envelope is not too large .",
    "these stars will also belong to pop iib , although their internal chemical composition will be that of pop iia at the bottom of the vertical branch .      in this subsection",
    ", we will be more specific as to the environment in which our two - phases scenario could occur .",
    "as we have shown in section 9.1 , the _ two branches diagram _ seems to define a universal relation for stars more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , it should therefore apply to all halo stars .",
    "since the halo is also populated by globular clusters ( gcs , see the recent review by meylan & heggie 1997 ) , we have searched for a connection between them and the field halo stars ( fhs ) , and we propose the following ease ( evaporation / accretion / self - enrichment ) scenario : + ( 1 ) all fhs were born in ( proto- ) gcs ; + ( 2 ) gcs have undergone a chemical evolution ; + ( 3 ) some of the gcs were disrupted at an early stage in their evolution , the lower mass stars forming pop iia ; + ( 4 ) in the gcs which have survived , accretion of matter from agb stars modifies the surface composition of the cluster stars ; + ( 5 ) some low mass stars evaporate from the gcs or get dispersed in the halo when the gc is disrupted .",
    "they form pop iib fhs .",
    "the relation between the thick disk and field halo stars on the one hand and gcs on the other hand is substantiated by the similarities in kinematic properties and metallicity distributions between : + ( 1 ) the fhs and the gcs more metal - poor than [ fe / h ] @xmath9 (  halo gcs \" ) ; + ( 2 ) the thick disk stars and the gcs more metal - rich than [ fe / h ] @xmath9 (  disk gcs \" ) ; + ( zinn 1985 , armandroff 1989 , harris 1998 ) .",
    "a few authors ( cayrel 1986 ; smith 1986 , 1987 ; morgan and lake 1989 ) have considered the possibility of gcs self - enrichment by sne and , through simple and qualitative arguments , have shown that this was indeed possible under certain conditions .    in a recent paper ,",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have developed a more detailed model for the early dynamical evolution and self - enrichment of gcs which supports the first part of our scenario .",
    "they show that the sn explosions of the first generation stars trigger the formation of an expanding shell , decelerated by the surrounding hot ism , in which second generation stars can form .",
    "they also discuss the conditions for a gc to survive this phase of chemical self - enrichment .",
    "while the second generation stars are forming , the proto - gc may become unstable and disruption can occur .",
    "this can happen at any time during the sne phase .",
    "it is important to notice that , at the time of disruption , the metallicity is fixed by the rate of mixing of the enriched matter expelled by sne with the pre - existing ism , i.e. , by the ratio of the mass of the processed material to the mass of the ism . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of [ @xmath1/fe ] depends on the mass distribution of the type  ii sne which have exploded by the time of disruption . of course",
    ", only the less massive stars are still visible now .",
    "they form pop iia and they appear somewhere on the slowly varying branch , depending on the time at which disruption of the proto - gc occurred . all stars originating from a given proto - gc",
    "should have the same [ @xmath1/fe ] value but stars coming from different proto - gcs will have different values .",
    "since the disrupted proto - gc has not completed its chemical evolution , some of the stars dispersed in the halo may have a much lower metallicity than the lowest ones presently observed in the gcs , independently of their respective [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "the gc can also survive the sne phase . when all stars more massive than about 8 @xmath10 have exploded as sne , the @xmath1 and @xmath0 elements synthesis stops , leading to a typical value of [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "such a view is supported by the analysis of carney ( 1996 ) who finds that gcs do not show any significant variations in [ @xmath1/fe ] despite wide variations in [ fe / h ] , age and kinematics .    according to fig .  7",
    ", our scenario requires this typical value of [ @xmath1/fe ] to be the maximum value observed in the _ two branches diagram _ , which in turn implies an increase of [ @xmath1/fe ] with time in a given proto - gc .",
    "the end of the sne phase must indeed correspond to the bottom of the vertical branch .",
    "such an increase with time , i.e. , with decreasing mass of the progenitor , is in agreement with the theoretical yields computed by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) although such results are still rather uncertain since other computations ( e.g. thielemann et al .",
    "1993 ) show different behaviours .",
    "moreover , such an interpretation of fig .",
    "7 implies a nearly solar [ ti / fe ] for the most massive sne , which is also in agreement with some of the models computed by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the fact that [ y / fe ] increases with [ ti / fe ] for pop iia stars would indicate that the ratio of the y yield to the fe yield increases with decreasing mass of the sn progenitor ( fig .",
    "7 ) . on the other hand , the roughly constant value obtained for the heavy s elements ( ba",
    ", la , ce ) observed in fig .",
    "9 suggests that the ratio of the yields ( ba , la , ce)/fe does not vary significantly with the mass of the progenitor .    in a second phase ,",
    "intermediate mass stars evolve until they reach the agb where they enrich their envelope in @xmath2-process elements due to dredge - ups during the thermal pulses . through stellar winds or superwinds ,",
    "those enriched envelopes are ejected and they pollute the surrounding less massive stars by accretion .    no new stars would be formed at this stage because the remaining ism is probably too diffuse . during the subsequent evolution of the gc ,",
    "some of these surface enriched low mass stars evaporate and form pop iib .",
    "those stars can also get dispersed in the halo when the gc gets disrupted ( e.g. , when crossing the disk ) .    for a typical @xmath0 element like eu , the behaviour of [ eu / fe ] versus [ @xmath1/fe ] ( fig .",
    "7 ) is completely different , showing a perfect correlation in pop iia stars and an absence of the vertical @xmath2-process feature , replaced by a clumping of the points representative of pop iib stars at the constant value of [ @xmath1/fe ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] , characteristic of the end of the massive stars outburst .",
    "this shows that , if also produced by lower mass stars , it must be in roughly the same proportions as fe .",
    "our ease scenario nicely explains the features observed in the _ two branches diagrams_. it is schematically displayed in fig .   13 .",
    "pop iia stars mostly originate from disrupted proto - gcs , their [ @xmath1/fe ] depending on the moment at which disruption occurs .",
    "pop iib stars escape later in the evolution of the cluster , after the end of the sn phase .",
    "this ease scenario can also explain the larger metallicity range covered by the fhs , extending to much lower metallicities than the gcs .",
    "the very metal - poor stars have escaped from the proto - gcs at a very early stage of the outburst phase , when the chemical enrichment of the cloud was still very low .",

    "<S> their relation with the @xmath1 elements is not linear . in a first group of stars , </S>",
    "<S> the relative abundance of the @xmath2 elements increases only slightly with the @xmath1 elements overabundance until the latter reaches a maximum value . for the second group , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 elements show a rather large range of enhancement and a constant ( and maximum ) value of the @xmath1 elements overabundance .    </S>",
    "<S> this peculiar behaviour leads us to distinguish between two sub - populations of metal - poor stars , namely pop@xmath3iia ( first group ) and pop@xmath3iib ( second group ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a scenario of formation of metal - poor stars based on two distinct phases of chemical enrichment , a first phase essentially consisting in supernova explosions of massive stars , and a second phase where the enrichment is provided by stellar winds from intermediate mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we assume that all thick disk and field halo stars were born in globular clusters , from which they escaped , either during an early disruption of the cluster ( pop@xmath3iia ) or , later , through an evaporation process ( pop@xmath3iib ) . </S>"
