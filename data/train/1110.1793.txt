    "recent analyses of the stellar kinematics suggest a larger mass of 6.6 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this larger mass gives an apparent size @xmath4 8 @xmath5as for the schwarzschild radius @xmath6 .",
    "this galaxy therefore provides a unique opportunity to study the relativistic outflow with the highest physical resolution in units of r@xmath7 .",
    "based on the vla / vlbi observations during the past three decades , the structure of the m87 jet has been extensively examined .",
    "@xcite found a smooth variation of the jet opening angle from 60@xmath8 at @xmath4 0.03 pc to smaller than 10@xmath8 over @xmath4 10 pc , indicating that the jet is being collimated by the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) process @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting features in the m87 jet is the bright knot g , lying about 1@xmath9 ( @xmath4 78 pc ) from the core in the vla maps @xcite .",
    "that region has been resolved by the hst into a structured complex known as `` hst-1 '' @xcite .",

    "it consists of bright knots , whose ( apparent ) proper motions are superluminal with a range of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a similar velocity pattern has been observed at radio frequencies using the vlba .",
    "the component of hst-1 which is furthest upstream ( i.e. , hst-1d ) , is stationary to within the errors ( @xmath12 ) , and has been identified as the origin of the superluminal ejections @xcite .",
    "the structure of the jet downstream of hst-1 ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 kpc ) can be characterized by a conical shape with an opening angle of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "hst-1 is also a remarkable site for large flaring activity across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio through optical to x - ray bands @xcite .",
    "chandra observations show that the flaring event started in 2000 , and its brightness eventually increased more than 50 times .",

    "we conducted the merlin observations on 9 march 2007 at a wavelength of 18 cm with defford , cambridge , knockin , darnhall , jodrell bank and tabley stations . both left and right circular polarization data were transferred from each telescope with 15 mhz bandwidth .",
    "initially , the data were pipelined , and a channel - by - channel flux scale derived from 3c 286 observation was applied .",
    "after this _ a priori _ amplitude calibration , we self - calibrated the data using difmap .",
    "we also analyzed archival vlba data of the m 87 jet ( bk073 ) .",

    "4 ifs , each with an 8-mhz bandwidth , were recorded at each telescope .",
    "data reduction was conducted in the same manner as for the evn observations .",

    "we show the images from evn , merlin and vlba observations in fig .",
    "[ ipol - maps ] .",
    "image qualities are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the bright core at the eastern edge of the jet and continuous jet emission are detected in all images .",
    "we define the core with a gaussian model which was fitted to the innermost bright region in all the images .",
    "the isolated component at the distance of 900 mas from the core in the evn image is the hst-1 knot .",
    "it corresponds to the first bright component to the west of the core in the merlin image .",
    "this feature was not detected in the vlba image at 15 ghz , since that data were taken before the hst-1 component underwent its flaring event .",
    "one of the most important achievements in our observations is a clear detection of continuous jet emission up to 500 mas from the core in the evn image .",
    "the continuous jet structure between 160 and 500 mas has been suggested in previous measurements @xcite , but here they are robustly detected and resolved with high significance in our evn observations .    in order to illustrate the structure of the m 87 jet , we analyze the jet emission along a position angle of 338@xmath18 and fit the cross sections of the jet with one gaussian or multiple gaussians for all the images .",
    "we define the width of the jet as the deconvolved fwhm for the one - gaussian fitting case . for the multiple - gaussian fitting case",
    ", we define the distance between the outer edges of the fwhms as the width of the jet .",
    "we note that the jet cross sections can be represented mainly by two gaussians when multiple gaussians were fitted .",
    "this is consistent with the edge brightened model suggested by previous observations @xcite .",
    "we show the radius of the jet as a function of the deprojected distance from the core in units of @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ r - z ] .",
    "note that the radius as defined perpendicular to the jet does not suffer from orientation effects .",
    "we assume that the viewing angle of the jet is 14@xmath18 based on a beaming analysis @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we use the deprojected distance along the jet throughout the paper .",
    "we note that 1 mas corresponds to 530 @xmath6 in deprojected distance .",
    "we measure the radius of the jet at the innermost region by using the previous vlba image at 43 ghz by @xcite as well .",
    "the jet radius increases downstream , as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ r - z ] .",
    "we found that the streamlines of the m87 jet can be divided into two different regimes : i ) a parabolic shape with @xmath19 = 1.73 @xmath20 0.05 ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the radius of the jet emission and @xmath23 is the axial distance from the core ) , on scales up to @xmath4 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath24 @xmath6 , and ii ) a conical shape with @xmath19 = 0.96 @xmath20 0.1 starting at around 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath24 @xmath6 .",
    "it is remarkable that the jet propagates with a single power - law streamline over more than three orders of magnitude in distance .",
    "furthermore , it is notable that the two observed power - law streamlines intersect at 2 @xmath1 10@xmath25 , which is close to the bondi radius of 3.8 @xmath1 10@xmath24 @xmath6 ( @xmath4 250 pc ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is the first observational evidence detecting a transition from parabolic to conical streamlines in extragalactic jet systems .",
    "we consider a conical streamline ( @xmath26 ) for supersonic jets . in an adiabatic jet ,",
    "the internal pressure @xmath27 decreases with axial distance @xmath23 as @xmath28 ( @xmath29 : the ratio of specific heats ) .",
    "so , we speculate that the constant expansion of the jet radius and a conical structure downstream of hst-1 to knot a in the m87 jet , requires the same axial gradient for the external ism pressure , @xmath30 , as @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath32 decreases slower than @xmath31 , then @xmath33 at some distance so that a recollimation shock will be triggered @xcite .",
    "the self - similar solution of a conical streamline for the magnetized case ( with a purely toroidal field component ) requires @xmath34 @xcite . for a general ( non - self - similar ) case ,",
    "@xmath35 is allowed in analytical and numerical models @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations reveal the ism properties such as the bondi radius @xmath36 250 pc and the king core radius @xmath37 kpc ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the region of conical streamlines in the m87 jet lies between @xmath38 and the marginal radius for the power - law decay beyond @xmath39 in the king profile , indicating that the ism distribution is essentially uniform .",
    "we thus rule out that the structure downstream of hst-1 is hydrostatically confined by @xmath32 in order to conform to a conical streamline .    in order to possess a conical streamline without any over - collimation between knots hst-1 and a , the condition @xmath40 should be maintained .",
    "knots hst-1 to a do appear to be over - pressured with respect to the external pressure @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath31 of the inter - knot regions , as estimated by the minimum energy argument for the vla data @xcite , appears under - pressured with respect to @xmath30 , as estimated by the recent x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "one possibility is an underestimation of the magnetic field strength when the toroidal ( azimuthal ) components are not considered , cf .",
    "it has been further suggested that the magnetic field energy is at least in equipartition ( or even larger with a factor of 1 @xmath4 2 ) with the energy of the radiating ultrarelativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "we note that over - pressured knots do appear to have trails of stationary recollimation shocks in purely hydrodynamic jets .",
    "@xcite performed hydrodynamic simulations to apply stationary recollimation shocks to the observed knots at vla scales under the assumption of the shallow ism gradient ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "stationary features , however , are in conflict with the observed large proper motions @xcite , while the ism also does not appear to have such a gradient .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the highly magnetized nature of the jet may be responsible for the conical part of the m87 jet .",
    "we next consider a parabolic streamline ( @xmath42 ) for supersonic jets .",
    "it is shown that the magnetized jet can be parabolic in analytical and numerical models where the ism pressure is decreasing as @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "a self - similar solution , also exists for non - magnetized cases with a pure parabolic streamline ( @xmath44 ) under the same @xmath30 dependence with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "their solution indicates @xmath46 with pressure increasing near the jet edge .",
    "so far , no analytical or numerical solutions , except @xmath47 , have been derived in the non - magnetized cases .",
    "we note that even in a hydrodynamic recollimation shock model , the jet boundary ( `` shocked zone '' at the interface of the jet and the ism ) is expected to be parabolic . however , the ism is required to be _ uniform _ ( @xmath48 ) @xcite .    in order to have parabolic streamlines ,",
    "@xmath49 is required in magnetized jets .",
    "it is important to examine the distributions of @xmath50 .",
    "a recent analytical model for a giant adaf @xcite shows @xmath51 from beyond @xmath38 down to the smbh , and it is universally derived for slow rotation of the ism ( @xmath52 30 % of the keplerian speed ) with the wider range of the @xmath53-viscosity parameter ( 0.001 - 0.3 ) @xcite . a spherically symmetric accretion with mhd turbulence @xcite produces @xmath54 without a strong dependence on the parameters and the equation of state .",
    "however , the spatial resolution in current x - ray observations is not high enough to resolve this region .",
    "the radius of hst-1 appears to be smaller than the size estimated by the two power - law streamlines .",
    "the maximam measured radius of the hst-1 region is 2200 @xmath6 @xmath20 300 @xmath6 and mean value is 1300 @xmath6 @xmath20 150 @xmath6 , while the expected radii are 3000 @xmath6 @xmath20 400 @xmath6 for the parabolic case and 4100 @xmath6 @xmath20 200 @xmath6 for the conical case , respectively .",
    "one possibility is that the jet is subjected to over - collimation towards hst-1 .    as is seen in fig .",
    "[ r - z ] , hst-1 is located downstream of the bondi radius ( @xmath55 ) , where the jet changes from parabolic to conical shape .",
    "this transition is presumably caused by the different profiles of the external pressure ( changing from steep to shallow gradients ) : the distribution of the external gas follows the influence of gravity from the central smbh inside of @xmath55 , while it can be flattened outside of @xmath38 .",
    "the field strength @xmath56 at hst-1 is 0.5  20 mg as estimated by the x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "supposing @xmath57 1 mg for our reference , the magnetic pressure is expected to be about 100 times larger ( i.e. , over - pressured ) than the ism value @xmath58 dyn @xmath59 ( * ? ? ? * @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 kev ) .",
    "another interesting objective is understanding the production of the superluminal components @xcite .",
    "the observed motions are modeled by the quad relativistic shocks in the mhd helical jet @xcite .",
    "recent optical polarimetry requires a coherent helical field to explain the distribution of polarization vectors ( perpendicular to the jet ) @xcite and variations of the radio electric vector positional angles as well as the fractional polarization degree @xcite , indicating either a helical distortion to the jet or a shock propagating through a helical jet @xcite .",
    "an interpretation for the origin of hst-1 as a hydrodynamic recollimation shock has been proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s06 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bl09 ) .",
    "s06 does not explain the observed gradual collimation , and is inconsistent with our observational result .",
    "they assume a freely expanding ( _ i.e. _ , a conical ) jet which is already in the particle - dominated regime upstream of hst-1 .",
    "s06 suggests a shallow external pressure profile @xmath63 inside some critical radius of 3@xmath9 ( @xmath64 234 pc ) , as determined by a stellar cusp ( a break in the stellar surface brightness of the m87 host galaxy ) @xcite .",
    "bl09 also models the recollimation shock at hst-1 with the same pressure profile .    in summary , we propose that a transition from parabolic to conical streamlines , occurs via a strong compression , due to the change in the slope of the axial profile of @xmath30",
    ". this condition can be achieved by an imbalance between @xmath65 and @xmath30 in the radial direction due to the over - collimation .",
    "it is remarkable that recent general relativistic mhd simulations @xcite reproduce the observed transition from parabolic ( @xmath66 ) to conical ( @xmath67 ) streamlines .",
    "however , the scale of the transition does not match with the observations .",
    "we suggest that the properties of mhd jets should be considered in a realistic ism environment .",
    "recent vlba observations indicate the vlbi core at 43 ghz ( core@xmath68 ) is located at 20 @xmath6 from the position of the smbh for the viewing angle of 14@xmath18 @xcite . with the vlba image",
    ", the size of the core@xmath68 can be measured to be 17 @xmath20 4 @xmath6 at the position angle of 68@xmath18 , which is approximately perpendicular to the jet axis . if we assume the core is the innermost part of the jet emission , the radius of the jet is 9 @xmath20 2 @xmath6 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the extrapolated radius of the jet of 9 @xmath20 2 @xmath6 assuming parabolic streamlines in the inner region .",
    "if this is the case , the jet propagates with a single power - law streamline over more than four orders of magnitude of distance .",
    "the jet opening angle is one of the key parameters in the mhd jet acceleration mechanism .",
    "* hereafter bp82 ) suggest that the jet is initiated by the magneto - centrifugal force if the jet inclination angle between the penetrating magnetic line of force and accretion disk is smaller than 60@xmath18 , which corresponds to a jet opening angle larger than 60@xmath18 .",
    "if we assume that the core@xmath68 is the innermost part of jet emission , the jet opening angle would be estimated to be 46@xmath18 at 20 @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the core@xmath68 would be located downstream of the alfvn surface where the magnetic pressure gradient force plays a role .",
    "thus , future sub - mm vlbi projects can access initial acceleration mechanisms by direct imaging and measure the deviation from parabolic streamlines upstream of the core@xmath68 .    furthermore , as we show in fig . [ r - z ] ,",
    "the parabolic jet can be extrapolated to the vicinity of the smbh . at the `` axial '' distance of @xmath23",
    "= 3.4 @xmath6 from the smbh , it intersects the theoretically - expected , inner stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the accretion disk for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "if the jet radius departs from the extrapolation line well beyond 3.4 @xmath6 , it will indicate that the jet originates in the accretion disk ( bp82 ) .",
    "if the streamline is as extrapolated down to 3.4 @xmath6 , the jet must originate from the accretion disk ( bp82 ) around a spinning black hole and/or the ergosphere of the spinning black hole ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bz77 ) .",
    "if we see no departure down to 0.5 @xmath6 from the smbh , it indicates that the jet originates from the ergosphere of the spinning black hole ( bz77 ) .",
    "note that the above discussion for prograde spinning black holes , while the upper limit of the isco is 4.5 @xmath6 for retrograde spinning black holes .",
    "therefore tracing back the ridge line and identifying the ejection point of the jet is one of the crucial tests to an evaluation of the formation mechanism of the jet ( bp82 and/or bz77 ) .",
    "more fundamentally , it provides an important method for detection the spin of the smbh and evaluation of the general theory of relativity .",
    "such conjectures will be explored by direct imaging with future submm vlbi experiments .",
