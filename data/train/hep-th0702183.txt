    "spontaneous particle production in the presence of strong electric fields is perhaps one of the most interesting phenomena associated with the charged quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "the study of supercritical effects and resonant particle production by strong coulomb - like potentials dates back to the pioneering works of pieper and greiner @xcite and gershtein and zeldovich @xcite where it was shown that spontaneous positron production was possible when two heavy bare nuclei with total charge larger than some critical value @xmath0 collided with each other .",
    "the critical @xmath0 is the value for which the @xmath1 state of the hydrogenlike atom with total charge z has energy @xmath2 .",
    "the idea behind supercriticality lies in spontaneous positron emission induced by the presence of very strong attractive vector potentials .",
    "the presence of a strong electric field induces the energy level of an unoccupied bound state to sink into the negative energy continuum , i.e , an electron of the dirac sea is trapped by the potential , leaving a positron that escapes to infinity .",
    "the electric field responsible for supercritical effects should be stronger than @xmath3 , which is the value of the gap between the negative and positive energy continua .",
    "such strong electric fields could be produced in heavy - ion collisions @xcite    in the last years the one - dimensional dirac equation in an external potential @xmath4 has been studied in connection to the levinson theorem in relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the interest in this problem can be found in their applications in semiconductor physics , field theory and one - dimensional qed among others .",
    "one - dimensional dirac electrons can be considered as three - dimensional problems when @xmath4 depends only on one space variable @xcite .",
    "the relation between supercritical states and the levinson theorem in the one - dimensional dirac has been established by ma _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and calogeracos and dombey @xcite .",
    "recently the relation between transmission resonances and supercriticality effects have been studied in a one - dimensional barrier @xcite and in a woods - saxon potential @xcite , which is a smoothed form of a square well .",
    "here the dirac equation presents half - bound states with the same asymptotic behavior of those obtained with the potential barrier .",
    "supercritical states with @xmath2 have been also studied in a one - dimensional cusp potential @xcite and in a class of short - range potentials @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we discuss the problem of computing the phenomenon of resonant particle creation in a one - dimensional symmetric cusp potential of the form    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the charge of the particle .    the potential ( [ a1 ] ) is an asymptotically vanishing potential for large values of the space variable @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 shows the depth of the well .",
    "the constant @xmath10 determines the shape of the potential . the expression ( [ a1 ] )",
    "can be regarded as a screened one dimensional coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a vectorial delta potential is strong enough to pull the bound state into the negative energy continuum @xmath2 @xcite , nevertheless this supercritical state does not evolve to a real resonant state .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the resonant behavior of the lowest energy states in a potential exhibiting a delta point interaction as asymptotic limit .",
    "the cusp potential ( [ a1 ] ) reduces to an attractive vectorial delta interaction of strength @xmath11 in the limit @xmath12 , as @xmath13 .",
    "the attractive potential ( [ a1 ] ) does not possess compact support and , in contrast to the delta potential case , it can exhibit more than one bound state .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to show that the cusp potential ( [ a1 ] ) is strong enough to sink the lowest electron bound state into the negative continuum to create a resonant state . in order to calculate the process of embedding of the bound state into the negative energy continuum",
    "we construct the jost solutions and their corresponding jost functions @xcite .",
    "we estimate , with the help of the phase shift and the wigner time - delay @xcite , the mean life of the resonance and how it depends on the shape and strength of the potential .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we solve the 1 + 1 dirac equation in the potential ( [ a1 ] ) and derive the equation governing bound states , energy resonances and supercritical states . in section 3",
    "we compute , with the help of the jost functions , the transmission and reflection amplitudes and the phase shifts .",
    "we derive the condition for energy resonances and estimate the mean life of the antiparticle state .",
    "finally , in section 4 we summarize our results .",
    "in two dimensions , the dirac equation in the presence of the spatially dependent electric field ( [ a1 ] ) can be written as @xcite    @xmath14    where the @xmath15 matrices satisfy the commutation relation @xmath16 and the metric @xmath17 has the signature @xmath18 here and along the paper , we adopt the natural units @xmath19    since we are working in 1 + 1 dimensions , it is possible to choose the following representation of the dirac matrices @xmath20 taking into account that the potential ( [ a1 ] ) does not depend on time , we can write the spinor @xmath21 as follows @xmath22 substituting the gamma @xmath23 matrices ( [ rep ] ) into the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) , we obtain the following system of coupled differential equations @xmath24 @xmath25 the spinor solution of the system ( [ a1])-([a2 ] ) , exhibiting a regular behavior as @xmath26 , can be expressed in terms of the whittaker function @xmath27 @xcite as follows    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a constant , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for negative values of @xmath9 , we have that the solution of the system ( [ a1])-([a2 ] ) showing a regular behavior as @xmath32 can be expressed in terms of the whittaker functions @xmath33 as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a constant and @xmath36    imposing the continuity of the spinor solution @xmath37 at @xmath38 , and demanding the existence of non - trivial values for @xmath35 and @xmath29 , we obtain that resonances and bound levels satisfy the energy condition :    @xmath39    given the values of the strength @xmath4 and the shape parameter @xmath10 , the expression ( [ energy ] ) exhibits solutions with @xmath40 real , showing that the cusp potential ( [ a1 ] ) is able to bind particles , a property that , for instance , is absent in the pure one - dimensional coulomb potential . the number of energy levels in the cusp potential decreases as the shape parameter decreases .    as the potential depth increases for large values of @xmath4 , the energy eigenvalues of the bound states decrease .",
    "when the lowest energy bound state reaches the value @xmath2 , this level merges with the negative energy continuum and the potential becomes supercritical .",
    "for @xmath41 we have that @xmath42 and , using eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , we obtain the condition for supercriticality    @xmath43    as soon as the potential strength @xmath4 becomes larger than the supercritical value @xmath44 , the lowest bound state dives into the energy continuum becoming a resonance .",

    "in order to study resonant states associated with dirac particles in a cusp potential , we proceed to discuss the scattering process with the help of the jost functions @xcite .",
    "resonances can be identified as poles of the scattering matrix @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "since the components of the scattering matrix as well as the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be expressed in terms of the reflection and transmission amplitudes , we proceed to compute @xmath54 and @xmath55 with the help of the incoming @xmath56 and outgoing @xmath57 jost solutions , where plus and minus indicate the asymptotic right and left solutions .",
    "since the cusp potential ( [ a1 ] ) decays faster than @xmath58 for large values of @xmath9 , there are solutions of the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) that behave asymptotically as free traveling plane wave spinors .",
    "those solutions exhibiting this asymptotic behavior are called jost solutions @xcite .",
