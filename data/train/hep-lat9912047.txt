    "decorrelation of the topological charge in hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) simulations of qcd with dynamical fermions is a long standing problem . for staggered fermions",
    "an insufficient tunneling rate of the topological charge @xmath0 has been observed @xcite . for wilson fermions",
    "the tunneling rate is adequate in many cases @xcite .",
    "however on large lattices and for large values of @xmath1 near the chiral limit the distribution of @xmath0 is not symmetric even after more than 3000 trajectories ( see figure  1 of @xcite and similar observations by cp - pacs @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been observed that sensitive observables like the @xmath2 correlator are @xmath0 dependent @xcite .",
    "thus it appears to be important to look for simulation methods that give good distributions of @xmath0 .",
    "the idea of parallel tempering is to improve transitions in parameter regions where tunneling is suppressed by opening ways through parameter regions with little suppression . in",
    "qcd the method has been applied successfully for staggered fermions @xcite . in @xcite",
    "parallel tempering has been used to simulate qcd with o(@xmath3)-improved wilson fermions without finding any gain , however , with only two ensembles which does not take advantage of the main idea of the method .    here",
    "parallel tempering is used in conjunction with hmc to simulate qcd with ( standard ) wilson fermions .",
    "the gain achieved is demonstrated by studying time series and histograms of the topological charge and by comparing statistical errors of the topological susceptibility @xmath4 .",
    "in standard monte carlo simulations one deals with one parameter set @xmath5 and generates a sequence of configurations @xmath6 .",
    "the set @xmath5 here includes @xmath7 , @xmath1 , the leapfrog time step and the number of time steps .",
    "@xmath6 comprises the gauge field and the pseudo fermion field .    in the parallel tempering approach",
    "@xcite one simulates @xmath8 ensembles ( @xmath9 in a single combined run .",
    "two steps alternate : ( a ) update of @xmath8 configurations in the standard way , ( b ) exchange of configurations by swapping pairs .",
    "swapping of a pair of configurations means @xmath10 with the metropolis acceptance condition @xmath11 @xmath12 since after swapping both ensembles remain in equilibrium , the swapping sequence can be freely chosen . in order to achieve a high swap acceptance rate",
    "one will only try to swap @xmath13-pairs that are close together . if the chosen @xmath13-values lie on a curve in the @xmath13-plane there are three obvious choices for the swapping sequence of neighboring @xmath13-pairs .",
    "one can step through the curve in either direction or swap randomly .",
    "it has turned out that it is advantageous to step along such a curve in the direction from high to low tunneling rates of @xmath0 .",
    "the standard wilson action for the gauge and the fermion fields was used .",
    "the lattice size was @xmath14 .",
    "the hmc program applied the standard conjugate gradient inverter with even / odd preconditioning .",
    "the trajectory length was always  1 .",
    "the time steps were adjusted to get acceptance rates of about 70% . in all cases",
    "1000 trajectories were generated ( plus 50100 trajectories for thermalization ) .",
    "@xmath0 was measured by the field - theoretic method after 50 cooling steps of cabibbo - marinari type .",
    "this method gives close to integer values which were rounded to the nearest integers .",
    "( note that the results presented in @xcite were obtained without rounding . )",
    "statistical errors were obtained by binning , i.e. , the values given are the maximal errors calculated after blocking the data into bins of sizes @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "several tempered hmc simulations were run in the quenched approximation ( tempering in @xmath7 ) and with dynamical fermions ( tempering in @xmath1 , at fixed @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . for comparison also standard hmc simulations have been performed .",
    "figures [ fig5.5 ] and [ fig5.6 ] show typical comparisons of time series and histograms of @xmath0 .",
    "one sees that with tempering considerably more topologically nontrivial configurations occur and that the histograms of @xmath0 become in general more symmetrical and broader",
    ".    in standard runs @xmath0 frequently stayed for quite some time near 1 or near @xmath19 , while with tempering this never occurred .",
    "the standard run at @xmath20 shown in figure  [ fig5.6 ] , where @xmath0 gets trapped in this way for about 200 trajectories , provides an example of this .",
    "such observations have also been made on large lattices @xcite .    while a correlation analysis can not be carried out with the given size of samples , some quantitative account of the improvement by tempering is possible using the mean of the absolute change of @xmath0 , called mobility in @xcite , @xmath21 results for @xmath22 are given in tables  [ tab5.5 ] and  [ tab5.6 ] . if @xmath23 for all trajectories then @xmath24 is the hmc time between topological events .",
    "since that condition holds in most of the cases presented here one gets an idea of the quantitative improvement by tempering .",
    "another quantitative estimate of improvement comes from the statistical errors of @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that statistical errors decrease with the square of hmc time provides a second quantitative criterion for the speed - up of a simulation .",
    "quantitative results at @xmath25 are summarized in table  [ tab5.5 ] . from the ratios of mobilities and squared ratios of errors of susceptibilities one obtains speed - ups between 2 ( ratio of @xmath22 at @xmath26 ) and 16 ( squared ratio of the errors of @xmath4 at @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is a considerable gain , especially if runs at several values of @xmath1 need to be done , what is usually the case .    at @xmath28 tempering looks even better in the sense that the standard hmc runs do not really resolve the topological properties for @xmath29 ( see table  [ tab5.6 ] and figures  [ fig5.6 ] and  [ fig5.6_q2 ] ) .",

    ", < , < , < , < \" , ]     indeed more and more ensembles will be needed on larger lattices if one wants to keep @xmath30 and the parameter range constant .",
    "however it is an open question which effect is stronger , the decrease of @xmath31 or the slowing down of tunneling between topological sectors .",
    "the hope is that the need to take more ensembles more than compensates the slowing down of tunneling .",
    "on the @xmath14 lattice parallel tempering considerably enhances tunneling between different sectors of topological charge and generates samples with more symmetrical charge distributions than can be obtained by standard hmc .",
    "the histograms also get slightly broader or even become nontrivial thanks to this technique .",
    "the enhancement of tunneling indicates an improvement of decorrelation also for other observables .",
    "more satisfactory histograms are important for topologically sensitive quantities . both of these features make parallel tempering an attractive method for large - scale qcd simulations .",
    "the method is particularly economical when several parameter values have to be studied anyway .",
    "a potential problem is that for a given parameter set the swap acceptance rate ( [ pswap ] ) decreases for increasing lattice volume @xcite . to settle the question whether on larger lattices the need for increasing the number of ensembles is compensated by improved tunneling between topological sectors this study",
    "will be continued on larger lattices .",
