    "<S> the onset of thermalization in a closed finite system of randomly interacting bosons , at the level of a single eigenstate , is discussed . </S>",

    "<S> the analytical expression for the eigenstate temperature as a function of the inter - particle interaction and energy is complemented by numerical data .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction - _ the subject of thermalization occurring in isolated quantum systems of interacting particles has been developed the last two decades due to various applications in nuclear and atomic physics  @xcite , as well as in view of basic problems of statistical mechanics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently the interest to this subject has increased due to experiments with cold atoms and molecules in optical lattices  @xcite and trapped ions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , many theoretical and numerical studies have been performed in order to understand the mechanism of thermalization in the absence of a heat bath ( see  @xcite and refs therein ) . nevertheless , despite some studies about the onset of thermalization as a function of various physical parameters such as the number of particles@xcite , the strength of inter - particle interaction@xcite , the choice of initially excited states  @xcite , the role of these items still remains open .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now clear that the mechanism driving the thermalization in isolated systems of interacting particles is associated with quantum chaos  @xcite . differently from the well developed one - body chaos theory , </S>",
    "<S> many problems related to many - body chaos , such as the thermalization of fermi and bose particles , are currently under intensive studies . unlike classical chaos which is intrinsically related to the instability of motion with respect to a change of initial conditions , quantum chaos manifests itself in specific fluctuations of the energy spectra and in the chaotic structure of the eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> as it was shown in @xcite , the properties of the energy spectra are less important to the statistical relaxation to a steady - state distribution than the structure of the eigenstates in the physically chosen many - particle basis . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the main interest in the study of many - body chaos was shifted , since long , to the properties of many - body eigenstates .    </S>",
    "<S> chaotic eigenstates play a key role in the statistical description of isolated quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> as stressed long ago @xcite , conventional statistical mechanics can be established on the level of individual quantum states and not only by means of averaging over many states . however , this fact has no practical consequences unless the conditions for such a situation are developed , thus providing a practical tool for a statistical description based on individual states . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of establishing these conditions appears to be even more important when considering systems with a small number of particles .    at variance with eigenvalues , </S>",
    "<S> many - particle eigenstates are defined by means of a suitable single - particle basis . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , from its side has a direct relevance to a physical reality , specifically , to the choice of the mean field to which quantum observables such as occupation numbers are referred to . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , we assume that the total hamiltonian @xmath0 can be presented as the sum of the mean field part @xmath1 describing non - interacting ( quasi ) particles , and a residual interaction @xmath2 , modeled here below as a two - body random interaction . </S>",
    "<S> such a setup , based on a random interaction , can also serve as a good model for a completely deterministic interaction between bosons ( see , for example @xcite ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the complexity in off - diagonal many - body matrix elements emerges due to an inherit complicated nature of the interaction itself .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the chaotic structure of the eigenstates and the notion of energy shell that is filled by the components of these eigenstates , we address the question of the form of the occupation number distribution ( ond ) obtained on the level of a single eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a semi - analytical approach thus revealing the conditions for the emergence of the bose - einstein ( be ) distribution , provided that the chosen eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath0 consists of many uncorrelated components defined by the projection of @xmath0 onto @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to introduce the temperature of a single many - body eigenstate .    </S>",

    "<S> the hilbert space generated by the many - particle basis states has the dimension @xmath10 and in what follows we focus on the case of @xmath11 particles in @xmath12 levels ( dilute limit , @xmath13 ) for which @xmath14 . two - body random interaction ( tbri ) matrices were introduced long ago in @xcite and have since been extensively studied , although mainly for fermions@xcite . as for the bose particles , few studies have been done mainly in the dense limit , @xmath15 @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> if these components can be considered as random and non - correlated ones , this is the case of _ chaotic _ eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> note that for isolated systems such eigenstates typically fill only a part of the unperturbed basis @xcite . to characterize the structure of the eigenstates , we use the _ @xmath25function _ , @xmath26 which is the energy representation of an eigenstate . from the same components </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 one can construct also the _ strength function _ ( sf ) of a basis state @xmath27 , @xmath28 widely used in nuclear physics @xcite and known in solid state physics as _ local density of states_. </S>",
    "<S> the sf shows how a basis state @xmath27 decomposes into the exact eigenstates @xmath24 with energies @xmath29 , due to the interaction @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be measured experimentally and is of great importance since its fourier transform gives the time evolution of an excitation initially concentrated in the chosen basis state @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , it defines the survival probability to find the system at time @xmath30 in the initial state @xmath27 .    in finite systems </S>",
    "<S> the density of states ( dos ) has a bell shape and in many cases can be approximated by a gaussian , apart from its edges . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show that its second moment equals @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the second moment of the unperturbed dos and @xmath33 is the second moment of the sf  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typically , on increasing the interaction strength , the sf in isolated systems undergoes a crossover from a delta - like function ( trivial perturbative regime ) to the breit - wigner ( bw ) regime , with a width well described by the fermi golden rule . with a further increase of the interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the form of the sf tends to a gaussian , see refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is demonstrated in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fmi02]a , b and observed experimentally in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the basic concepts related to the onset of many - body chaos and thermalization is the so - called _ energy shell _ which is the energy region defined by the projection of @xmath2 onto the basis of @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this region is the largest one that can be occupied by an eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> the partial filling of the energy shell by an eigenstate can be associated with the many - body localization in the energy representation , a subject that is nowadays under intensive investigation ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrary , if the chaotic eigenstates fill completely the energy shell , this corresponds to maximal quantum chaos and delocalization . </S>",
    "<S> below we demonstrate that , indeed , global thermalization emerges when the eigenstates fully fill the energy shell . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> non - thermal states fill the energy shell only partially ( see fig .  2  of suppl . </S>",
    "<S> material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter driving the crossover from non - chaotic to chaotic eigenstates can be defined as @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the energy range spanned by those basis states effectively coupled by the interaction @xmath2 , and @xmath36 is the number of these states ; the average over all @xmath37 basis states is assumed . due to its fluctuating nature </S>",
    "<S> this parameter can be considered only at a global level , thus characterizing the _ global route _ to thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover can be described by computing the second moment @xmath38 and the half - width @xmath20 of the sf , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fmi02]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the square root of the second moment is a linear function of @xmath2 , the half - width @xmath20 of the sf ( for a not too strong interaction , @xmath39 ) is a quadratic function of @xmath2 , as predicted by the fermi golden rule . </S>",
    "<S> the two curves crosses at @xmath40 which gives an efficient estimate for the bw - gaussian crossover . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fmi02]a ) and b ) we show the sf for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , together with the bw and gaussian fit , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the region where the sf is well described by the bw corresponds to eigenfunctions with a relatively small number @xmath22 of principal components . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that in this region the level spacings distribution @xmath43 shows deviations from the wigner - dyson distribution ( wdd ) . differently , </S>",
    "<S> when the sf is well described by a gaussian , eigenstates of @xmath0 consist of many chaotic components and @xmath43 is well fitted by the wdd .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the bose - einstein distribution - _ having identified the nature of the crossover from the bw regime to the gaussian one , let us see how this crossover impacts on the distribution of single - particle occupation numbers . </S>",
    "<S> according to the definition , they are defined , for any eigenstate @xmath44 , as follows , @xmath45 as one can see , the ond ( [ spond ] ) consists of two ingredients : the probabilities @xmath46 and the occupation numbers @xmath47 related to the basis states of @xmath1 only . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers ( for bosons ) are just integer numbers @xmath48 depending on how many particles occupy the single - particle level @xmath49 in a specific many - body state @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> if the eigenstate @xmath51 of @xmath0 consists of many uncorrelated components one can substitute @xmath46 by the corresponding strength function obtained either by an average over a number of eigenstates with close energies , or _ inside an individual eigenstate _ , for example , with the use of the  moving window \" average @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the knowledge of the sf allows one to obtain the form of the ond without the diagonalization of a huge hamiltonian matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> now we address the following question : can the standard be - distribution , that is derived for non - interacting bosons in the thermodynamic limit , describe a system consisting of a finite number of interacting particles ? if yes , under which conditions ? </S>",
    "<S> to address this question we start with the basic relations , @xmath52 where @xmath3 is the total number of bosons and @xmath53 is the energy of a system for which we neglect the inter - particle interaction . </S>",
    "<S> as is known , the solution of these equations for @xmath54 leads to the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath55 note that the derivation can be obtained due to the combinatorics only , with the constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the lagrange multipliers . </S>",
    "<S> commonly , the meaning of @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the inverse temperature and chemical potential , respectively , emerges when the system is connected with a heat bath . </S>",
    "<S> however , below we show that one can speak of the be distribution even if the system is isolated ; moreover , this distribution emerges on the level of a single eigenstate of the total hamiltonian . inserting ( [ fbe ] ) into ( [ fco ] ) and taking into account that the number of particles if fixed , one gets the chemical potential and the temperature as a function of @xmath53 only . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a given energy @xmath53 a proper be distribution is obtained and from it , the temperature of a single eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> now the question is : what energy in the right - hand part of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fco ] ) should be used for strongly interacting bosons in order to have a close correspondence to the ond obtained numerically@xcite ?     </S>",

    "<S> _ we have shown that the standard bose - einstein distribution , known to appear for ideal gas in the thermodynamic limit , emerges on the level of an individual eigenstate in an isolated system with a finite number of particles . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when the inter - particle interaction is strong enough to lead to the onset of chaotic many - body eigenstates in the basis defined by the chosen single - particle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allows one to give an analytical estimate for the temperature of such eigenstates , confirmed by direct numerical data . </S>",
    "<S> we also established global and local conditions for the emergence of thermal states , based on the concepts of conventional statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the global condition that gives the criterion for treating the whole system as a thermalized one , the local criterion addresses individual states and the size of the fluctuations of the occupation numbers . </S>",
    "<S> all analytical findings are complemented by numerical data .    </S>",
