    "the present paper is motivated by the increasing awareness in the community of the role of an @xmath1 linear collider ( lc ) for a precise determination of the susy parameters which are needed to interpret the dark matter ( dm ) content of the universe .",
    "after the wmap results leading to an accuracy on @xmath7 at the @xmath8 level and awaiting for the planck mission in @xmath9 which aims at @xmath10 , it seems appropriate to check that a lc can do its job properly on this essential topic .",
    "the main issue is to compare the susy prediction derived from the collider measurement and the dm result observed in our universe .",
    "a significant mismatch would reveal the existence of extra components of dm in the universe which are predicted within susy ( e.g.  the gravitinos ) or beyond susy ( e.g.  the axions ) .",
    "an important issue is also to check with this type of physics the effect of some choices discussed for the future lc .",
    "this paper will explain in which way the dm issue can provide some useful informations .",
    "after an introduction of these arguments intended for ` pedestrians ' , a quantitative study will be presented to illustrate the problem .    in the susy scenario with r - parity conservation ,",
    "the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is the lightest neutralino @xmath11 .",
    "this particle is considered as the best candidate to satisfy the cosmological constraints on dm in the universe .",
    "dm constraints have been recently re - examined  @xcite within the msugra scenario , confronting the precise predictions obtained after the wmap results .",
    "these data imply , for many of the working points retained , a very small difference between the lightest slepton mass , the susy partner of the @xmath12 which will be called @xmath0 , and the lsp mass since one of the preferred mechanism to regulate the amount of dm in the universe is the so - called ` co - annihilation mechanism ' .",
    "since this feature is quite general and goes beyond the msugra scheme as pointed out in @xcite , one should investigate the possible experimental consequences on the detection of sleptons at a lc .",
    "the detectability of the tau slepton in such a small mass difference has been discussed recently in @xcite in msugra for a @xmath13gev lc collider .    to understand the effect of mass degeneracy",
    ", one should recall the mechanism which regulates the amount of dm in the universe and is based on thermodynamics and on annihilation cross sections between susy particles .",
    "the @xmath14 annihilation cross section is small since it occurs in a p - wave ( fermi exclusion principle for identical fermions ) with a kinematic suppression at threshold .",
    "a way out is to annihilate @xmath11 with @xmath0 but , given the boltzmann law , this can only occur during the cooling of the early universe if these particles have a small mass difference .",
    "how small should this mass difference be ?",
    "typically the ratio between the stau and neutralino populations is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass difference and where @xmath17 is the freeze - out temperature which is @xmath18 . to avoid a strong depopulation of @xmath0 , the mass difference should therefore be below @xmath19 which in practice means typically below @xmath3gev .",
    "since @xmath0 is significantly lighter than the other sleptons , the amount of dm will therefore primarily depend on the mass difference between @xmath11 and @xmath0 masses .",
    "when the @xmath11 mass increases one needs to increase the annihilation efficiency to keep at the same level the amount of dm density in the universe .",
    "this means that one needs to reduce even further @xmath16 .",
    "when the neutralino mass reaches about @xmath13gev this mechanism does not work anymore which gives an important upper limit on susy particles .",
    "admittedly there are other ways to solve this problem as will be discussed in detail in the next section .    from this qualitative presentation ,",
    "one therefore concludes that the susy scenario implies that :    1 .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath0 and the lsp is likely to be below @xmath3gev , 2 .",
    "the amount of dm depends critically on the mass of the stau particle .",
    "experimentally this means that the stau channel should be cleanly detected to measure its mass through a threshold scan . near threshold ,",
    "the cross section is at the @xmath3fb level with a potentially very large background due to the four fermion final states , the so - called ` @xmath2 ' background , which is at the nb level .",
    "moreover @xmath0 decays into a @xmath12 lepton with one or two neutrinos in the final state which even further reduces the amount of visible energy .",
    "in usual cases the standard backgrounds can be eliminated by requiring that the two observed leptons be acoplanar thus eliminating the @xmath2 background provided that the forward veto forces spectator electrons to be emitted at almost zero angle in the four fermion process .",
    "this veto usually starts above a polar angle of @xmath20mrad which is sufficient to cope with ordinary susy mass differences for a @xmath13gev collider . the present paper intends to quantify the effect for the susy solutions retained in @xcite .",
    "the next issue to be considered is the reduction in efficiency of this veto in case there is a crossing angle between electron and positron beams , @xmath21mrad , as needed in the warm technology and as also envisaged in the tesla scheme .",
    "finally , one should also worry about the efficiency of this veto given the very large overlaid background produced by beam - beam interaction which hits the very forward electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "this paper therefore also intends to provide an input on these various aspects .",
    "for a simple discussion of the issues presented in the introduction , the msugra scheme is hereafter adopted .",
    "the mass spectrum depends on two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the common masses of scalars and gauginos superpartners at the unification scale .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 , defining the higgsino mass , is derived , in absolute value , by imposing the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) condition in terms of these two parameters and of tan@xmath25 , the ratio of the vacuum expectations which appear in the two higgs doublets of susy .",
    "the various regions allowed by ewsb and dm constraints and the position of the various working points chosen are schematically displayed in figure  [ fig : para_space ] .",
    "-5 mm    1 .   for moderate values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "the lsp solution is a bino , the susy partner of the sm @xmath26 gauge boson .",
    "the annihilation cross section for a pair of lsp , which controls the amount of dm in the universe , proceeds through selectron exchange and can be easily adjusted to cope with the wmap constraints .",
    "2 .   for larger values of @xmath23 and moderate values of @xmath22 ,",
    "the rate of annihilation through selectron exchange becomes insufficient and co - annihilation between the lsp and the lightest sleptons , in particular @xmath0 , are needed .",
    "when the lsp mass increases , the co - annihilation process should increase , meaning that the mass difference between the lsp and the slepton should tend to zero at some point . for moderate values of tan@xmath25 ( not larger than @xmath27 ) , this maximum value is about @xmath13gev , which incidentally means that this type of mechanism for generating dm should be covered by a tev collider .",
    "the exact amount of dm in the universe depends crucially on the mass of the lsp , which can be easily determined using end - points smuon ( or selectron ) decays as can be seen in figure  [ fig : emu ] , and on the mass of @xmath0 which can be determined through a threshold scan .",
    "if the mass difference between the lightest stau and the lsp is too small , the separation from the background will become problematic and these scans could be extremely time consuming or even impossible . the accuracy on the @xmath0 mass is primordial since it governs the accuracy on the prediction of dm in the universe which will be known to a few percent after the planck mission .",
    "this aspect will therefore be the main emphasis of the present study .",
    "3 .   for large values of @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "there are , within msugra , two scenarios to cope with the wmap constraints .",
    "+ in the ` focus ' solution , @xmath22 is large but @xmath24 can be smaller than @xmath23 meaning that the lsp is of the higgsino type and therefore can annihilate into @xmath28 pairs in the early universe .",
    "this solution can lead to a degeneracy between the lsp and the lightest chargino but , given that the chargino cross section is much larger than the slepton one , this situation can be dealt with using events having photons originating from initial state radiation ( isr ) as was shown at lep2 .",
    "it turns out , however , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : focus ] , that the degree of degeneracy is not severe for light neutralinos and therefore one can achieve standard accuracies for light gaugino masses . as pointed out in reference @xcite and as can be seen in figure  [ fig : baer10 ] , and @xmath29 axes so that they are the same as in figures  [ fig : para_space ] and [ fig : tanx10 ] .",
    "] this type of solution is not well covered by lhc since , with very heavy squarks and gluinos , the only accessible susy particles are the first generation chargino and the two lightest neutralinos which need to be produced directly through quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "+ -15 mm + in the ` higgs annihilation ' solution , the lsp mass is close to half the heavy cp odd higgs mass meaning that lsp annihilate through @xmath30channel into a heavy higgs .",
    "this mechanism only operates for very large values of @xmath31 , typically above @xmath32 , which are allowed and even needed to accomplish unification between the yukawa couplings of the third generation ( but discarded in some ` string inspired ' theories  @xcite ) .",
    "this solution leads to no particular constraints on the detection of the lsp but corresponds to mass solution which tends to fall beyond the reach of lc and , in some cases , even also beyond the reach of lhc .",
    "figure  [ fig : baer10 ] shows , for moderate @xmath31 , the allowed region in green and the expected coverage from lhc and lc . in the co - annihilation region , at moderate @xmath22 , the lhc has a wider coverage but the lc can fully cover the dm solutions provided that there are no detection problems . in the focus region , lc extends the reach of lhc but , as previously mentioned , the detection issue is less critical and will be briefly discussed in section  [ sec : focus ] .",
    "the @xmath33 measurement  @xcite indicates a deviation with respect to the sm prediction based on @xmath1 data .",
    "the deviation favors @xmath34 and moderate msugra masses .",
    "the indication is confirmed since the @xmath1 cmd2 data used are found in good agreement with the recent data  @xcite of kloe based on the radiative return method .",
    "the discrepancy  @xcite with the @xmath12 decay analysis from lep1 and cleo , which is significant , remains however to be clarified .",
    "figure  [ fig : tanx10 ] from @xcite indicates that , taking into account the old @xmath33 constraint , the most likely solutions correspond to the co - annihilation region . with the recent update from bnl  @xcite , the deviation with respect to the @xmath1 sm prediction , is almost reaching 3 standard deviations ( s.d . )  and should therefore increase the significance of this indication .",
    "-5 mm    there are several caveats to above conclusions .",
    "first , the co - annihilation solution may sound heavily ` fine tuned ' since it requires a very tight correlation between the two msugra mass parameters .",
    "one can however notice that in the so called ` gaugino mediated susy breaking ' scenario , @xmath22 which is loop - mediated is naturally small and a mass degeneracy between the neutralino and the right - handed sleptons occurs naturally  @xcite .",
    "the two other mechanisms previously discussed are also fine tuned and one can not really object to any of these solutions in the absence of a definite susy breaking scheme .",
    "one may also argue that , in a general mssm scheme , there is more flexibility and one could for instance have a wino - like lsp , in which case there is no need for the co - annihilation mechanism to regulate primordial dm . in this general mssm approach and for other phenomenological reasons ( e.g.  cp violation in the flavor sector , proton lifetime constraints )",
    "one may wish to have very heavy sleptons at least for the first two generations . in this case the lsp mass could not be anymore determined from the smuon analysis but would require to use the chargino / neutralino channels .",
    "there could however still be a similar experimental problem , with co - annihilation between the stau and the neutralino with small mass difference .",
    "table  [ tab : scenarios ] recalls the msugra solutions retained in @xcite and clearly indicates the trend described above .",
    "figure  [ fig : emu ] shows the energy distribution of the muons originating from smuon decays for solution d@xmath35 .",
    "two end points are clearly visible and their measurement allows to precisely extract the values of the mass of the slepton and of the lsp provided the lower point can be separated from the @xmath2 background .",
    "the serious concern is about the stau analysis which , as shown in the same figure , has very soft final state particles to deal with .",
    "._[tab : scenarios ] working points ( model ) taken from reference @xcite .",
    "note that in some cases ( e@xmath35,f@xmath35,h@xmath35,m@xmath35 ) the resulting dm content obtained from micromegas  @xcite does not match the wmap constraints .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one should be able to achieve threshold scans for the charginos and to access the mass difference through the dilepton mass distribution given by the @xmath36 channel .",
    "one can then use the cross section measurement and the polarization asymmetry in the @xmath37 channel to measure the parameter @xmath24 which governs the estimate of dm .",
    "this has been done assuming the accuracies given in @xcite and the formulae taken from @xcite .    with these very precise chargino / neutralino masses ,",
    "the main source of uncertainty is due to the cross section measurement and the main error on @xmath7 is due to @xmath31 since there is a poor sensitivity for high values of @xmath31 .",
    "there is no other practical mean to determine this quantity , given that the sfermions and the heavy higgses are inaccessible in the focus scenario . in spite of this , the precision achieved on @xmath7 would be largely sufficient to demonstrate a contradiction with the wmap result and therefore imply that there are other sources of dm .",
    "one therefore concludes that even if the observation of the chargino / neutralino sector is easy at a lc ( and perhaps only achievable at a lc ) in a focus scenario , the accuracy on the indirect determination of the dm content of the universe requires the highest possible accuracies .",
    "it is however fair to say that much more work is still needed to cover this scenario .",
    "this analysis has shown that the detection and the mass measurement of the tau slepton , potentially important in view of the cosmological implications , is challenging in the so - called ` co - annihilation ' scenario .",
    "a forward veto to remove the @xmath2 background down to very small angles is essential to reach an almost background free result , adequate to achieve the accuracy implied by the post - wmap generation in a model independent analysis .    from the present analysis , which includes the relevant backgrounds but not yet a fully realistic modelization of the detector response",
    ", one can already state that :    1 .",
    "in the zero angle crossing situation , only possible in the tesla scheme , the detection of the stau particles can be done with almost negligible background , 2 .",
    "for these solutions , the requirement to match the planck era precision demands luminosities of at least @xmath13fb@xmath38 even with an optimized strategy of scanning .",
    "this further strengthens the need for a collider able to deliver the maximum luminosity , not necessarily at the maximum energy , 3 .   in the tesla case , with a half crossing angle of @xmath3mrad",
    ", there is only a @xmath39 degradation of the efficiency which therefore leaves open this possibility , 4 .   in the nlc case ,",
    "the same conclusion could be reached provided that there is no degradation due to pile - up of several bunches in the forward veto ( this may requires some r@xmath40d for a very fast calorimeter ) .",
    "very useful contributions to the forward veto issue have been provided by k.  buesser , k.  moenig and a.  stahl . they are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this study has also benefited from interesting suggestions and criticisms on the physics analysis aspects from g.  blanger , u.  martyn , g.a .",
