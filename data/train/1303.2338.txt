    "the ` difficulty ' in utilizing this pioneering data led to some modelers attempting to develop simplified approaches .",
    "for example , @xcite used an approach which was based on truncating the zero - density dr sum over rydberg states using a simple density dependent cut - off which itself was based on early collisional - radiative calculations by @xcite ; a suppression factor was formed from its ratio to the zero - density value and then used more generally .",

    "we utilize an approach to dr suppression which is motivated initially by the detailed collisional - radiative results given in @xcite for at @xmath4 k , along with known scalings to all temperatures , charges , and densities . using these results as a guideline , a more general suppression formula",
    "is then determined by fitting to suppression results from extensive detailed collisional - radiative calculations @xcite for a wide range of ions at several densities and ( high ) temperatures .",
    "additional modifications are then introduced to account for low temperature dr .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows : in the next section we describe the dr suppression model we use ; we then apply this suppression to the zero - density dr data , and use the resultant density - dependent dr data in cloudy to determine the ionization distribution produced under photoionized and collisional ionization equilibrium at low and moderate densities .",
    "we use the following approach , detailed more fully in the subsections below .",

    "lastly , the suppression formulation is extended to low - temperatures according to the nature of the sequence - specific dr .",
    "we begin by considering dr of li - like , for which the density dependent total dr rate coefficient , and therefore the suppression factor , has been computed rigorously within a collisional - radiative modeling approach @xcite .    in the electron collisional ionization case , because of the consequential high temperature of peak abundance , dielectronic recombination occurs mainly through energetically high - lying autoionizing states ( via dipole core - excitations ) for which radiative stabilization is by the core electron into final states just below the ionization limit : @xmath5 in the zero - density limit , the intermediate @xmath6 states can only decay further via radiative cascading until the @xmath7 final recombined ground state is reached , thereby completing the dr process : @xmath8 for finite electron densities @xmath9 , on the other hand , there is also the possibility for reionization via electron impact , either directly or stepwise , @xmath10 and the probability of the latter pathway is proportional to the electron density @xmath9 .",

    "the temperature @xmath24  k is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ]",
    "there is generally good qualitative agreement .",
    "however , it is seen that the original formulation , based on the @xcite results , shows a somewhat stronger suppression effect up to @xmath69 .",
    "this is likely due to the more accurate treatment of the partial dr data of @xcite entering the collisional - radiative modeling , although some difference due to the collisional - radiative modeling itself may also be present .",
    "this indicates that even collisional plasmas require collisional - radiative modeling with state - of - the - art dr data .",
    "the stronger suppression tails - off at @xmath70 as three - body recombination starts to become relevant and which , at even higher densities ( not shown ) , causes the suppression factor to rise ( since it is a ratio of effective recombination rate coefficients , i.e. includes three - body recombination . )      the preceding formulation was based on the suppression factor found by @xcite for electron collisionally ionized plasmas , i.e. , at higher temperatures , where dr is dominated by high-@xmath71 resonances attached to a dipole - allowed core excited state . in photoionization equilibrium , however , the temperature at which a given ion forms is substantially smaller than that found in the electron collisional case . due to the lower kinetic temperatures , dr occurs mainly through energetically low - lying autoionizing states , often via non - dipole core - excitations for which radiative stabilization is by the ( outer ) rydberg electron .",
    "these states are not , in general , as susceptible to density suppression as their high-@xmath71 counterparts , and so it may be necessary to modify the preceding suppression formulation .    we first consider sequences with partially - occupied @xmath72-subshells in the ground state , which includes the b - like @xmath73 , c - like @xmath74 , o - like @xmath75 , f - like @xmath76 , al - like @xmath77 , si - like @xmath78 , s - like @xmath79 , and cl - like @xmath80 systems . for these sequences , there is fine - structure splitting in the ground state and a correspondingly small excitation energy , @xmath81 , giving dielectronic capture into high principal quantum numbers ( because of the rydberg relation @xmath82 ) .",
    "stabilization is via @xmath83 transitions and the recombined final state is built upon an excited parent .",
    "ultimately , it is the strength of collisional coupling of this final state with the continuum which determines whether recombination or ionization prevails . as the density increases , collisional lte extends further down the energy spectrum .",
    "it is difficult to give a general statement about the position of such final states relative to the ionization limit .",
    "so , we assume a worst case scenario , i.e. , that such states are subject to suppression , and we use the preceding suppression formula .",
    "if density effects are found to be small in photoionized plasmas then this is likely sufficient .",
    "if they appear to be significant then a more detailed treatment based on collisional - radiative modeling will be needed .",
    "thus , for these systems , we retain the same suppression formula developed above , that is , @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and for all @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    for the hydrogenic and the closed - shell he - like and ne - like cases , on the other hand , the excitations proceed via an increase in core principal quantum number  @xmath86 or @xmath87  giving the dominant dielectronic capture into the low-@xmath88 resonances . even following core radiative stabilization ,",
    "these low - lying states are impervious to collisional reionization for the range of densities @xmath89 , and thus we set @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",

    "[ eqsuppression2 ] , so we do not modify @xmath93 for these cases .",

    "the dr cross section , shown in the inset , is dominated by two features .",

    "nevertheless , it is nearly half a century since @xcite demonstrated significant density effects on dr , and it is time that some representation exists within astrophysical modeling codes to assess its impact on the much more rigorous demands made by modern day modeling , especially given its routine incorporation by magnetic fusion plasma modeling codes . in the longer term",

    "<S> we have developed a general model for determining density - dependent effective dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rate coefficients in order to explore finite - density effects on the ionization balance of plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> our model consists of multiplying by a suppression factor those highly - accurate total zero - density dr rate coefficients which have been produced from state - of - the - art theoretical calculations and which have been benchmarked by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression factor is based - upon earlier detailed collision - radiative calculations which were made for a wide range of ions at various densities and temperatures , but used a simplified treatment of dr . a general suppression formula </S>",
    "<S> is then developed as a function of isoelectronic sequence , charge , density , and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these density - dependent effective dr rate coefficients are then used in the plasma simulation code cloudy to compute ionization balance curves for both collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas at very low ( @xmath0 ) and finite ( @xmath1 ) densities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the denser case is significantly more ionized due to suppression of dr , warranting further studies of density effects on dr by detailed collisional - radiative calculations which utilize state - of - the - art partial dr rate coefficients . </S>",
