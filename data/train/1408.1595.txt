    "two largest modern experiments use scintillator detectors ( telescope array ) or water cherenkov detectors ( pierre auger observatory ) at ground for studying cosmic ray showers of ultra - high energies ( higher than @xmath0  ev ) .",
    "both experiments are located at the approximately same altitude ( around 1400  m  a.s.l .",
    "equivalent to 880  g/@xmath1 of atmospheric depth ) .",
    "thin scintillator detectors are dominantly sensitive only to the electromagnetic ( em ) component , while in water cherenkov detectors the signal is produced by em particles and muons ( em+@xmath2 ) as well . in any case",
    ", the signal ( @xmath3 ) of the surface detector array has to be corrected for an attenuation of shower size with respect to the amount of air penetrated before reaching the detector . in principle",
    ", there are two options how to correct for this effect : assume certain composition of primaries and use mc simulations or assume isotropy of arrival directions above certain energy and use measured data .",
    "telescope array uses the so called look - up table from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations providing the relation between the signal size , zenith angle ( @xmath4 ) and the shower energy  @xcite .",
    "only proton primaries are considered . at the pierre auger observatory , the so called constant intensity cut ( cic )",
    "method @xcite is applied to the measured data @xcite providing a relationship between the size of the signal and the @xmath5 at a given intensity ( energy ) cut . in the next step , for each shower the signal at the reference angle ( @xmath6 ) is calculated using normalized cic curve .",
    "the @xmath6 value is then related to the shower energy measured by the fluorescence detector .",
    "the cic curve is studied as a function of energy ( intensity cut ) . since no substantial deviations in the cic curve shape",
    "are found , just one normalized curve is finally used for all the showers .    for our studies we use toy mc in combination with an output from simulations produced by corsika ver .",
    "7.37  @xcite . based on very rough assumptions of the detector response",
    "we first calculate examples of the signal attenuation curves for proton and iron induced showers from the corsika simulations .",
    "we assumed responses for em , em+@xmath2 and @xmath2 types of observatories .",
    "these curves with an assumed size of signal fluctuations and energy independence then serve as an input for toy mc to generate a large number of events that are reconstructed by both mc - like and cic - like approaches .",
    "in our previous study @xcite we showed what happens to reconstructed energies if the primary particles are of a mixed composition from protons and iron nuclei .",
    "both possibilities - the application of the mc attenuation curve and the cic approach were investigated separately for em type as well as em+@xmath2 sensitive observatory .",
    "since the cic method is based on the assumption of the uniform distribution of events in @xmath5 , we also tried to estimate the influence of presence of a source at the highest energies violating to some extend this uniform distribution .    briefly summarizing , conclusions are as follows : mc approach applied to mixed composition yields to zenith angle bias on reconstructed energies .",
    "cic approach provides stable energy reconstruction for any composition mixture .",
    "cic approach is valid even for presence of very strong sources at the highest energies .    in this study",
    "we rather consider two types of surface detectors at a single observatory . a sensitivity to the mass composition of primaries utilizing different responses to iron nuclei and protons",
    "is shown using the same approach with corsika shower characteristics as inputs into toy mc .",
    "more details about our method can be found in our previous study .     for em detector ( left panel ) and @xmath2 detector ( right panel ) in the range [ @xmath7.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "we assumed two different detector responses at the same observatory located 1400  m  a.s.l .",
    "response of the first detectors is proportional to the density of em particles at ground ( threshold energy  1  mev ) and the response of the second type of detectors to the muon density ( threshold energy  50  mev ) produced by corsika .",
    "lateral distribution function at 1000  m from the shower core was chosen as a reference signal ( @xmath8 ,  @xmath9 ) .",
    "zenith angle dependence of averaged signals at 10@xmath10  ev of both detectors is shown in fig .",
    "[ absolutesignals ] for p , fe primaries and two hadronic interaction models : qgsjet  ii-04  @xcite and epos - lhc  @xcite@xcite . as common ,",
    "fluka model  @xcite was used for low energy interactions . for one zenith angle ,",
    "one primary type and one hadronic interaction model about 60 corsika showers were simulated",
    ". corresponding ratio of detector responses of iron nuclei to protons ( @xmath11 ) depending on @xmath12 is plotted on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ responsesfep ] . note that @xmath11 for @xmath2 detector is always above  1 and for em detector @xmath11 decreases even below  1 at @xmath13 .",
    "the relative attenuations for protons and iron nuclei together with the ratio of responses for qgsjet  ii-04 were included in the toy mc generating shower energies in the range @xmath14 $ ]  ev with spectral index 2.7 and the gzk feature at the end of the spectrum .",
    "the zenith angle was distributed uniformly from 0 to 60 degrees . in this way",
    ", we obtained @xmath15 triplets of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath4 for different mass compositions .",
    "only events with zenith angle less than 45@xmath16 were used in the further analysis to fulfil the full trigger efficiency of em detectors in current arrays .",
    "the different em and @xmath2 detector response to iron nuclei and protons implies a different event ordering according to the signal size in given bin of @xmath12 for mixed composition scenarios .",
    "this difference varies with zenith angle ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ responsesfep ] ) .",
    "assuming the same exposure for both detectors , we defined _ matched fraction _ being the relative number of the same events present in both sets of _",
    "n _ events with largest values of signal ( @xmath9 or @xmath8 ) for each bin in @xmath12 .",
    "value of _ n _ was chosen so that the @xmath17 largest signal corresponded to the energy @xmath1810  eev .",
    "different compositions of primaries were used to estimate _ matched fraction _ as a function of @xmath4 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ responsesfep ] ) . to exclude the combined effect of different size of fluctuations for iron nuclei and protons we used the _ matched fraction _",
    "normalized to @xmath19 ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ matchedfraction ] ) to study the sensitivity to the mass composition .",
    "the size of decrease of _ normalized matched fraction _ with zenith angle seems to be proportional to the amount of admixture .",
    "fitted quadratic function was chosen to describe this behaviour . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ matchedfraction ] the difference between the _ normalized matched fraction _ at @xmath19 and @xmath13",
    "is plotted vs. iron nuclei fraction to better visualize the mentioned effect .",
    "we considered a single observatory consisting of independent em and @xmath2 surface detector arrays .",
    "relative response to primary protons with respect to iron nuclei showed different zenith angle dependence for em and @xmath2 detectors .",
    "@xmath20  _ matched fraction _ as defined in the paper could be used to distinguish between pure and mixed composition scenarios when cic method is used to calculate the two attenuation curves at such a combined observatory .",
