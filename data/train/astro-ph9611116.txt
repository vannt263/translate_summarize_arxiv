    "studies of the large - scale structure of the universe over the last decade , led by observations of the distribution of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies , have revealed spectacular results , greatly increasing our understanding of this subject . with major surveys",
    "currently underway , the next decade will provide new milestones in the study of large - scale structure .",
    "i will highlight what we currently know about large - scale structure , emphasizing some of the unsolved problems and what we can hope to learn in the next ten years from new sky surveys .    why study large - scale structure ?",
    "in addition to revealing the `` skeleton '' of our universe , detailed knowledge of the large - scale structure provides constraints on the formation and evolution of galaxies and larger structures , and on the cosmological model of our universe ( including the mass density of the universe , the nature and amount of the dark matter , and the initial spectrum of fluctuations that gave rise to the structure seen today ) .    what have we learned so far , and what are the main unsolved problems in the field of large - scale structure ?",
    "i discuss these questions in the sections that follow .",
    "i first list some of the most interesting unsolved problems on which progress is likely to be made in the next decade using upcoming sky surveys .",
    "quantify the measures of large - scale structure .",
    "how large are the largest coherent structures ? how strong is the clustering on large scales ( e.g. , as quantified by the power spectrum and the correlation functions of galaxies and other systems ) ?    what is the topology of large - scale structure ?",
    "what are the shapes and morphologies of superclusters , voids , filaments , and their networks ?",
    "how does large - scale structure depend on galaxy type , luminosity , surface brightness ? how does the large - scale distribution of galaxies differ from that of other systems ( e.g. , clusters , quasars ) ?    what is the amplitude of the peculiar velocity field as a function of scale ?    what is the amount of mass and the distribution of mass on large scales ?",
    "does mass trace light on large scales ?",
    "what is in the  voids \" ?",
    "what are the main properties of clusters of galaxies : their mass , mass - function , temperature - function , and dynamical state ?    what is the mass density , @xmath3 , of the universe ?",
    "how does the large - scale structure evolve with time ?",
    "what are the implications of the observed large - scale structure for the cosmological model of our universe and for structure formation ?",
    "( e.g. , what is the nature of the dark matter ? does structure form by gravitational instability ?",
    "what is the initial spectrum of fluctuations that gave rise to the structure we see today ? were the fluctuations gaussian ? )",
    "two - dimensional surveys of the universe analyzed with correlation function statistics @xcite reveal structure to scales of at least @xmath4  mpc .",
    "large redshift surveys of the galaxy distribution reveal a considerably more detailed structure of superclusters , voids , and filament network extending to scales of @xmath5@xmath6  mpc ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent and largest redshift survey , the las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , with redshifts for @xmath7 galaxies , is presented in figure  [ fig : one ] ; it reveals the  cellular \" nature of the large - scale galaxy distribution . the upcoming sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , expected to begin operation in 1997 ( see   [ sec : five ] ) , will provide a three dimensional map of the entire high - latitude northern sky to @xmath8 , with redshifts for approximately @xmath9 galaxies .",
    "this survey , and others currently planned , will provide the large increase in the survey volume required to resolve some of the unsolved problems listed above .",
    "( see contribution by mckay , this volume . )",
    ".4 in .3 in    the angular galaxy correlation function was first determined from the 2d lick survey and inverted into a spatial correlation function by groth & peebles @xcite .",
    "they find @xmath10 for @xmath11  mpc , with correlations that drop to the level of the noise for larger scales .",
    "this observation implies that galaxies are clustered on at least @xmath12  mpc scale , with a correlation scale of @xmath13  mpc , where @xmath14 .",
    "more recent results support the above conclusions , but show a weak correlation tail to larger scales .",
    "the recent two - point angular galaxy correlation function from the apm 2d galaxy survey @xcite is presented in figure  [ fig : two ] .",
    "the observed correlation function is compared with expectations from the cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) cosmology ( using linear theory estimates ) for different values of the parameter @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the mass density of the universe in terms of the critical density and @xmath17 .",
    "the different @xmath18 models differ mainly in the large - scale tail of the galaxy correlations : higher values of @xmath18 predict less structure on large scales ( for a given normalization of the initial mass fluctuation spectrum ) since the cdm fluctuation spectrum peaks on scales that are inversely proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : two ] , as was first shown from the analysis of galaxy clusters ( see below ) , that the standard cdm model with @xmath19 and @xmath20 does not produce enough large - scale power to match the observations .",
    "as figure  [ fig : two ] shows , the galaxy correlation function requires @xmath210.2 for a cdm - type spectrum , consistent with other large - scale structure observations .",
    "-2.3 in 1.5 in    the power spectrum , @xmath22 , which reflects the initial spectrum of fluctuations that gave rise to galaxies and other structure , is represented by the fourier transform of the correlation function .",
    "one of the recent attempts to determine this fundamental statistic using a variety of tracers is presented in figure  [ fig : three ] ( @xcite ; see also @xcite,@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the determination of this composite spectrum assumes different normalizations for the different tracers used ( optical galaxies , ir galaxies , clusters of galaxies ) .",
    "the different normalizations imply a different bias parameter @xmath23 for each of the different tracers [ where @xmath24 represents the overdensity of the galaxy tracer relative to the mass overdensity ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] also shows the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) anisotropy as measured by cobe @xcite on the largest scales ( @xmath25  mpc ) and compares the data with the mass power spectrum expected for two cdm models : a standard cdm model with @xmath26 ) , and a low - density cdm model with @xmath27 .",
    "the latter model appears to provide the best fit to the data , given the normalizations used by the authors for the different galaxy tracers .",
    "the recent las campanas redshift survey has reported excess power on @xmath28  mpc scale over that expected from a smooth cdm spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is a most important observation that will need to be verified by larger surveys .",
    "-1.1 in 1.5 in    the next decade will provide critical advances in the determination of the power spectrum and correlation function .",
    "the large redshift surveys now underway , the sloan and the 2df surveys , will probe the power spectrum of galaxies to larger scales than currently available and with greater accuracy .",
    "these surveys will bridge the gap between the current optical determinations of @xmath22 of galaxies on scales @xmath29  mpc and the mbr anisotropy on scales @xmath30  mpc ( see mckay , this volume ) .",
    "this bridge will cover the critical range of the spectrum turnover , which reflects the horizon scale at the time of matter - radiation equality .",
    "this will enable the determination of the initial spectrum of fluctuations at recombination that gave rise to the structure we see today and will shed light on the cosmological model parameters that may be responsible for that spectrum ( such as @xmath18 and the nature of the dark matter ) . in the next decade , @xmath22 will also be determined from the mbr anisotropy surveys on small scales ( @xmath31 to @xmath32 ) , allowing a most important overlap in the determination of the galaxy @xmath22 from redshift surveys and the mass @xmath22 from the mbr anisotropy .",
    "these data will place constraints on cosmological parameters including @xmath33 , and the nature of the dark matter itself .",
    "another method that can efficiently quantify the large - scale structure of the universe is the correlation function of clusters of galaxies .",
    "clusters are correlated in space more strongly than are individual galaxies , by an order of magnitude , and their correlation extends to considerably larger scales ( @xmath34  mpc ) .",
    "the cluster correlation strength increases with richness ( @xmath35 luminosity or mass ) of the system from single galaxies to the richest clusters @xcite .",
    "the correlation strength also increases with the mean spatial separation of the clusters @xcite .",
    "this dependence results in a ",
    "universal \" dimensionless cluster correlation function ; the cluster dimensionless correlation scale is constant for all clusters when normalized by the mean cluster separation .",
    "empirically , the two general relations that satisfy the correlation function of clusters of galaxies , @xmath36 , are : @xmath37 , and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath39 is the amplitude of the cluster correlation function , @xmath40 is the richness of the galaxy clusters of type @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the mean separation of the clusters . ) these observed relations have been compared with expectations from different cosmological models , yielding powerful constraints on the models ( see below ) .    the observed mass function ( mf ) , @xmath43 , of clusters of galaxies , which describes the number density of clusters above a threshold mass @xmath44 , can also be used as a critical test of theories of structure formation in the universe .",
    "the richest , most massive clusters are thought to form from rare high peaks in the initial mass - density fluctuations ; poorer clusters and groups form from smaller , more common fluctuations .",
    "bahcall and cen @xcite determined the mf of clusters of galaxies using both optical and x - ray observations of clusters .",
    "their mf is presented in figure  [ fig : four ] .",
    "the function is well fit by the analytic expression @xmath45 with @xmath46 , ( where the mass @xmath44 represents the cluster mass within @xmath47  mpc radius ) .",
    "-2.0 in 1.5 in    bahcall and cen @xcite compared the observed mass function and correlation function of galaxy clusters with predictions of n - body cosmological simulations of standard @xmath48 and nonstandard @xmath49 cdm models .",
    "they find that none of the standard @xmath19  cdm models , with any normalization , can reproduce both the observed correlation function and the mass function of clusters .",
    "a low - density ( @xmath500.3 ) cdm - type model , however , provides a good fit to both sets of observations ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] ) .",
    "how is the mass distributed in the universe ?",
    "does it follow , on the average , the light distribution ? to address this important question , peculiar motions on large scales are studied in order to directly trace the mass distribution .",
    "it is believed that the peculiar motions ( motions relative to a pure hubble expansion ) are caused by the growth of cosmic structures due to gravity . a comparison of the mass - density distribution , as reconstructed from peculiar velocity data , with the light distribution ( i.e. , galaxies ) provides information on how",
    "well the mass traces light @xcite .",
    "a formal analysis yields a measure of the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "other methods that place constraints on @xmath52 include the anisotropy in the galaxy distribution in the redshift direction due to peculiar motions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "measuring peculiar motions is difficult .",
    "the motions are usually inferred with the aid of measured distances to galaxies or clusters that are obtained using some ( moderately - reliable ) distance - indicators ( such as the tully - fisher or @xmath53 relations ) , and the measured galaxy redshift .",
    "the peculiar velocity @xmath54 is then determined from the difference between the measured redshift velocity , @xmath55 , and the measured hubble velocity , @xmath56 , of the system ( the latter obtained from the distance - indicator ) : @xmath57 .",
    "the dispersion in the current measurements of @xmath52 is very large .",
    "no strong conclusion can therefore be reached at present regarding the values of @xmath52 or @xmath16 .",
    "the larger and more accurate surveys currently underway , including high precision velocity measurements , may lead to the determination of @xmath52 and possibly its decomposition into @xmath16 and @xmath23 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies can also serve as efficient tracers of the large - scale peculiar velocity field in the universe @xcite .",
    "measurements of cluster peculiar velocities are likely to be more accurate than measurements of individual galaxies , since cluster distances can be determined by averaging a large number of cluster members as well as by using different distance indicators . using large - scale cosmological simulations , bahcall et al .",
    "@xcite find that clusters move reasonably fast in all the cosmological models studied , tracing well the underlying matter velocity field on large scales .",
    "a comparison of model expectation with the available data of cluster velocities is presented by bahcall and oh @xcite .",
    "the current data suggest consistency with low - density cdm models .",
    "larger velocity surveys are needed to provide more robust comparisons with the models .",
    "optical and x - ray observations of rich clusters of galaxies yield cluster masses that range from @xmath58 to @xmath59 within @xmath47  mpc radius of the cluster center .",
    "when normalized by the cluster luminosity , a median value of @xmath60 is observed for rich clusters .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio implies a dynamical mass density of @xmath61 on @xmath62 scale .",
    "if , as suggested by theoretical prejudice , the universe has critical density ( @xmath19 ) , then most of the mass in the universe _ can not _ be concentrated in clusters , groups and galaxies ; the mass would have to be distributed more diffusely than the light .",
    "-2.0 in 1.5 in    a recent analysis of the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies , groups and clusters @xcite suggests that while the @xmath63 ratio of galaxies increases with scale up to radii of @xmath64@xmath65  mpc , due to the large dark halos around galaxies , this ratio appears to flatten and remain approximately constant for groups and rich clusters , to scales of @xmath66  mpc , and possibly even to the larger scales of superclusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] ) .",
    "the flattening occurs at @xmath67@xmath68 , corresponding to @xmath50 .",
    "this observation may suggest that most of the dark matter is associated with the dark halos of galaxies and that clusters do _ not _ contain a substantial amount of additional dark matter , other than that associated with ( or torn - off from ) the galaxy halos , and the hot intracluster medium . unless the distribution of matter is very different from the distribution of light , with large amounts of dark matter in the  voids \" or on very large scales",
    ", the cluster observations suggest that the mass density in the universe may be low , @xmath69 .",
    "clusters of galaxies contain many baryons . within @xmath47",
    "mpc of a rich cluster , the x - ray emitting gas contributes @xmath70  3@xmath71 of the cluster virial mass ( or @xmath7230% for @xmath73 ) @xcite .",
    "visible stars contribute only a small additional amount to this value .",
    "standard big - bang nucleosynthesis limits the mean baryon density of the universe to @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the baryon fraction in some rich clusters exceeds that of an @xmath19 universe by a large factor @xcite .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic simulations @xcite suggest that baryons are not preferentially segregated into rich clusters .",
    "it is therefore suggested that either the mean density of the universe is considerably smaller , by a factor of @xmath75 , than the critical density , or that the baryon density of the universe is much larger than predicted by nucleosynthesis .",
    "the observed baryonic mass fraction in rich clusters , when combined with the nucleosynthesis limit , suggests @xmath500.3 ; this estimate is consistent with the dynamical estimate determined above .",
    "future optical and x - ray sky surveys of clusters of galaxies should help resolve these most interesting problems .",
    "a detailed description of the upcoming sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is presented in these proceedings by mckay .",
    "i will not repeat it here .",
    "i only summarize that the sdss is a complete photometric and spectroscopic survey of @xmath76 steradians of the northern sky , using 30 @xmath77 pixel ccds in five colors ( @xmath78 ) , and two spectrographs ( @xmath79 ) with 640 total fibers .",
    "the 5-color imaging survey will result in a complete sample of @xmath80 galaxies to a limiting magnitude of @xmath81 , and the redshift survey will produce a complete sample of @xmath82 galaxy redshifts to @xmath83 ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath84 galaxy redshifts to @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) for the reddest brightest galaxies , @xmath84 quasar redshifts to @xmath87 , and @xmath88 rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "what are some of the most interesting scientific problems in large - scale structure that the large and accurate sloan sky survey can address ?",
    "quantify the clustering ( of galaxies , clusters of galaxies , quasars ) on large scales using various statistics ( power spectrum , correlation function , void - probability distribution , and more ) .",

    "( with the availability of up to hundreds of redshifts per cluster , the mass of clusters can be well determined and compared with x - ray and lensing masses .",
    "the cluster mass - function and velocity function will be accurately determined , as well as the @xmath63 and @xmath89 implications ) .",
    "study the evolution of galaxies , clusters , and superclusters to @xmath90 , and the evolution of quasars to @xmath91 .",
    "these should provide important new constraints on cosmology .",
    "use all the above to place strong constraints on the cosmological model and @xmath92 , as discussed in the previous sections .",
    "what are some of the important surveys needed in order to address the main unsolved problems listed in section [ sec : one ] ?",
    "i list below such surveys .",
    "optical , infrared , and radio redshift surveys ( of galaxies , clusters , quasars , agns ) .",
    "these will help solve the quantitative description of large - scale structure , its strength and topology , and the relation among the structures described by different objects .",
    "x - ray surveys of clusters , quasars , and possibly superclusters .",
    "these will allow a good determination of the contribution of the hot gas component in the universe , cluster masses and temperature function , baryon fraction in clusters ( and superclusters ? ) , and the evolution of clusters and quasars .",
    "high redshift surveys , using optical ground based telescopes ( keck ) , hst , x - rays , and radio , should reveal the important but yet unknown time evolution of structure in the universe .",
    "this will provide a fundamental clue to models of galaxy formation and cosmology .",
    "mbr anisotropy surveys , currently underway , will provide the fluctuation spectrum of the microwave background radiation and hopefully determine many of the cosmological parameters such as @xmath92 , @xmath16 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and the initial spectrum of fluctuations .",
