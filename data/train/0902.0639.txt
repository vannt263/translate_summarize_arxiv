    "one of the great unanswered questions in astrophysics is the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "since m31 is our closest spiral galaxy , located at a distance of @xmath1 780 kpc ( holland 1998 ) , it is considered an ideal astrophysical laboratory to test the different ideas about galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , the outer regions of galaxies are expected to hold a wealth of information about the way in which galaxies are assembled .",
    "for example , in order to explain how the milky way was formed , eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 ) and searle & zinn ( 1978 ) studied the kinematics and metallicity of stars and globular clusters in the bulge / halo of the milky way . while the former suggested the galactic halo formed during a rapid ( @xmath2 years ) monolithic collapse of a gaseous protocloud , the latter suggested formation via the accretion and merging of independent protogalactic fragments over a longer dynamical timescale ( 10@xmath3 years ) .",
    "importantly , searle & zinn s ( 1978 ) seminal paper on galactic globular clusters constitutes the basis for modern ideas relating to the formation of cosmological large scale structures in the universe ( e.g. white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "perhaps the main difference between the globular cluster systems of m31 and the milky way is that the former is more populous with an estimated total of @xmath1450 members ( barmby et al .",
    "2000 ; perrett et al .",
    "2002 ; huxor et al . 2008 ; caldwell et al . 2009 ) and may contain a significant population of intermediate age ( 36 gyr ) globular clusters .",
    "otherwise they share many similarities : a gaussian - like luminosity function that peaks around m@xmath4 = 7.62 mag with a dispersion of 1.06 mag ( barmby , huchra & brodie 2001 ) ; two subpopulations of mean metallicity [ fe / h ] = 1.57 and 0.61 associated with the halo and bulge , respectively ( barmby , huchra & brodie 2001 ; forbes , brodie & larsen 2001 ) ; and similar structural properties ( barmby et al . 2007 ) .",
    "a relevant recent discovery is that of a metal - poor stellar halo in m31 ( kalirai et al .",
    "2006 ; chapman et al .",
    "2006 ) . at projected radii beyond 60 kpc kalirai et al .",

    ", we present keck spectra for some of the furthest projected distant ( @xmath6 ) globular clusters known at this time in the halo of m31  gc5 and gc10 ( mackey et al . 2007 ) and gcm06 ( martin et al . 2006 ) .",
    "two of them ( gc5 and gc10 ) do not have spectroscopic information published to date .",
    "thus , we present , for the first time , their kinematics , structural parameters , ages and spectroscopic metallicities .",
    "we briefly discuss our results within the context of the halo assembly of m31 .",
    "the three globular clusters were selected from the imaging survey reported by martin et al .",
    "( 2006 , gcm06 ) and mackey et al .",
    "( 2007 , gc5 and gc10 ) .",
    "the spectra were observed with the keck / hires instrument ( vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on 2008 august 19 .",
    "the instrument setup employed a 086-wide , 70-long slit , providing a spectral resolving power of @xmath7 .",
    "the cross - disperser angle was set to cover wavelengths @xmath8@xmath9 . for each globular cluster ,",
    "3x900-s exposures were taken in succession , without any intervening re - acquisition sequences , with the slit oriented at the parallactic angle .",
    "exposures were offset from each other in the direction perpendicular to the parallactic angle ( i.e.  along the horizon ) .",
    "the first exposure was centred on the globular cluster with the others offset either side of centre .",
    "the offsets were 10 for gc5 and gcm06 and 08 for gc10 .",
    "the seeing was stable throughout the observations at @xmath108 .",
    "science and calibration data were reduced using the makee ( mauna kea echelle extraction ) keck observatory hires data reduction program , written by tom barlow .",
    "bias frames , flat - fields , order trace and thar arc images were taken as part of the keck base calibrations .",
    "the final reduction process comprised bias - subtraction and flat - fielding , using base calibrations which were previously co - added .",
    "the wavelength calibration was carried out with solutions obtained from the thar arc exposures , which provided typical mean residuals of 0.05 @xmath10 .",
    "spectra were then cosmic ray cleaned , sky - subtracted and extracted into a series of heliocentric corrected 2d spectra with no correction to a vacuum wavelength scale applied .",
    "the spectra were then combined with inverse variance weighting to yield the final spectrum of each cluster .",
    "basic properties for the 3 globular clusters are given in table [ t : obs ] .",
    "figure [ f : metal ] displays a portion of the final spectra indicating the data quality .",
    ".properties for the 3 outer globular clusters .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     when compared to the galactic globular cluster system , one remarkable aspect of the m31 globular cluster system is its large range in age .",
    "that is , while the milky way presents a very homogeneous old population , m31 displays a young population ( @xmath11 2 gyr ) , a number of intermediate age globular clusters ( 3 - 6 gyr ) and old globular clusters ( @xmath12 7 gyr ) as well ( e.g. beasley et al . 2005 ) .",
    "based on our stellar population analysis , we found that the present outer halo globular clusters of m31 have a mean age of around 10 @xmath13 3 gyr .",
    "this mean spectroscopic age determination is in agreement with the color - magnitude diagrams presented in martin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mackey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for these globular clusters .",
    "furthermore , our dynamical mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath14 @xmath12 1.5 ) are compatible with an old stellar population .",
    "our final derived parameters are summarized in table [ t : dynamics ] .",
    "spectroscopic metallicities for outer metal - poor globular clusters are essential to the scenarios of chemical enrichment of the halo in galaxies since these objects are considered halo - tracers . in table",
    "[ t : metal ] we present our spectroscopic metallicity determinations and , for comparison , the photometric metallicities .",
    "the final metallicities were computed as the median of the different spectroscopic values presented in table [ t : metal ] , with a robust uncertainty of 1.5@xmath15siqr ( semi - interquartile range ) being adopted .",
    "this lead to [ fe / h ] = @xmath161.37 @xmath13 0.15 dex for gcm06 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath161.33 @xmath13 0.12 dex for gc5 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath161.73 @xmath13 0.20 dex for gc10 .",
    "these values , taking all uncertainties into account , are consistent with the cmd ones reported in table [ t : metal ] for gc10 and gcm06 , while gc5 is a factor of 3 more metal - rich than the cmd estimate . note , however , that although the metallicity quoted for gc5 based upon the _ mgb _ method is also supported by visual inspection of the high - quality spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ f : metal ] , the higher value obtained by the median of the different spectroscopic measurements was adopted .",
    "both the photometric and spectroscopic methods have their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "whilst the former is reddening and distance - modulus dependent , the latter is calibration and model - dependent .",
    "furthermore , photometric metallicities are also susceptible to the set of isochrones used as well as to age - metallicity degeneracy on the red giant branch . on the other hand ,",
    "measurements of age , metallicity and elemental abundance from integrated spectra using a single index or pairs of orthogonal indices ( e.g. h@xmath17 vs. [ mgfe ] ) are especially susceptible to index calibration errors , a particular concern for our uncalibrated data .",

    "[ f : grad ] we present the behaviour of the mean metallicity as a function of the projected radii in the halo of m31 using our metal - poor globular cluster sample , together with additional values from the literature for field stars and globular clusters .",
    "three main aspects are illustrated in this figure .",
    "firstly , there seems to exist a metallicity gradient for the metal - poor globular clusters at a projected distance less than 50 kpc from the centre of m31 .",
    "secondly , we find tentative evidence for the mean globular cluster metallicity to flatten off at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.6 , which is similar to the lower threshold seen in many other galaxies ( e.g. forbes et al .",
    "thirdly , our results confirm that the globular clusters in m31 are systematically more metal - poor than their outermost counterpart field stars , bearing in mind that we may be sampling different physical radii .",
    "this point can be explained in the context of chemical pre - enrichment having taken place in m31 before most of the halo formation has occurred ( durrell , harris & pritchet 1994 , 2001 ) .",
    "similar results have also been found for giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. harris , harris & poole 1999 )",
    ". however , schorck et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show that the metallicity distribution function of the galactic halo field stars is indistinguishable from that of the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "currently , it is not clear what fraction of the milky way s halo has been assembled via dissipational collapse ( monolithic collapse and gas rich mergers ) , and which by dissipationless accretion .",
    "however , the global properties of the present - day globular clusters of the milky way suggest a scenario where the inner halo ( within 10 kpc ) was formed via dissipative collapse , while the outer halo has an accretion origin ( e.g. bica et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the metallicity trend in fig .",
    "[ f : grad ] is also consistent with this picture .",
    "it suggests that the steep metallicity gradient for the globular cluster system of m31 in the inner halo flattens in the outer regions",
    ". such a flattening could be indicative of the outer halo globular clusters being likely accreted from satellites during an early period of merging ( see e.g. font et al .",
    "in summary , we confirm that the 3 outer globular clusters in the present sample are kinematically members of the m31 globular cluster system and have structural parameters that , within the uncertainties , resemble those of the milky way globular clusters .",
    "furthermore , they are characterized by an old stellar population ( @xmath23 7 gyr ) , whose mean metallicity matches the m31 metallicity peak for halo globular clusters ( e.g. barmby , huchra & brodie 2001 ) . unlike the milky way",
    ", we confirm that the outer halo globular clusters of m31 are systematically more metal - poor than their counterpart field stars ( kalirai et al .",
    "2006 ) at a given projected radius .",
    "we also find evidence for a declining velocity dispersion with radius for the globular cluster system .",
    "= 1.84 ) and b518 ( [ fe / h]= 1.6 ) , respectively .",
    "error bars correspond to the standard error on the mean [ fe / h ] measurements .",
    "when available , the total number of objects used is also indicated .",
    "the horizontal lines delineate the bin - size adopted.,width=332 ]    we note that the most distant globular cluster in the milky way , am  1 , lies at 120 kpc .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that more globular clusters in the outer halo of m31 will be discovered with time , which should be followed - up with integrated - light spectra .",
