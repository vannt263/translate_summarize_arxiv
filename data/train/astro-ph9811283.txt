    "investigations of galactic chemical evolution and galaxy formation at moderate to high redshift have progressed rapidly in recent years due to spectroscopic observations from the ground and imaging campaigns with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) . to tie these studies into the present - day epoch ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the processes that govern galactic evolution within the local universe .",
    "determining the properties of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , which typically have velocities @xmath2v@xmath3@xmath2@xmath4100 kms@xmath5 , may prove to be an important step in revealing the processes that distribute and ionize gases in the halos of the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "these clouds can be studied spectroscopically without confusion from lower velocity absorption if suitable background sources can be found .",
    "there have been many ideas proposed to explain the distribution of hvcs on the sky and their kinematics , including supernova - driven `` galactic fountains '' ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) , ram pressure or tidal stripping of material from the magellanic clouds ( moore & davis 1994 ; lin _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , infalling gas from outside the milky way ( oort 1970 ; mirabel & morras 1984 ) , and identification of hvcs as intergalactic clouds within the local group ( blitz _ et al .",
    "however , distinguishing between all of these possible scenarios has not been easy , despite many years of study ( see wakker & van  woerden 1997 for a review of hvc properties and possible origins ) .",
    "traditionally , hvcs have been studied through their  21 cm emission , but it is now possible to make fundamental advances in understanding hvcs by examining their absorption properties in detail with the hst . we have obtained a full suite of _ goddard high resolution spectrograph _ ( ghrs ) absorption line observations to study the neutral and ionized gases in two hvcs in the direction of mrk509 ( @xmath6 ) . the clouds exhibit strong   absorption with little or no corresponding low ion ( , ) absorption or  21 cm emission down to a detection threshold of logn ( ) @xmath7 17.7 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "these `` civ - hvcs '' have ionization properties that are very different from those of gases in the galactic disk and low halo ( sembach _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows that the low velocity ( @xmath2v@xmath3@xmath2@xmath8100 kms@xmath5 ) gas in the galactic disk and halo along the mrk509 sight line is characterized by both high ionization and strong low ionization absorption .",
    "this is typical for diffuse interstellar gases in the milky way ( sembach & savage 1992 ) , but is very different than the civ - hvc absorption signature at @xmath2v@xmath3@xmath2@xmath7@xmath9340 to @xmath9170 kms@xmath5 , where the dominant absorbing ion is clearly . to a large degree , the civ - hvcs  resemble the low column density ( logn()@xmath817 ) qso metal line absorption systems , in which one often sees strong  ( and sometimes ) absorption but little low ionization absorption ( steidel 1990 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) .",
    "using the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) , we modeled the civ - hvcs   toward mrk509 as slabs of gas bathed in extragalactic background radiation with a qso spectral energy distribution and a mean intensity at the lyman limit j@xmath10(ll ) = 1@xmath1110@xmath12 erg @xmath13 s@xmath5 hz@xmath5 sr@xmath5 ( haardt & madau 1996 ) .",

    "the combination of @xmath14 constrained by the ionic ratios and an assumption about j@xmath10(ll ) , which is proportional to n@xmath15 , sets the density of the model cloud .",
    "the size , d = n(h)/n@xmath16 , is also determined since the observed metal line column densities yield n(h ) for a given metallicity .",

    "if the gas is photoionized by the extragalactic background or a combination of ultraviolet starlight and the extragalactic background , the clouds must be low density ( n@xmath16@xmath1910@xmath20  @xmath18 ) , large ( greater than several kiloparsecs ) , and mostly ionized ( n@xmath17/n@xmath16@xmath1910@xmath21 ) regions located well beyond the neutral gas layer of the galaxy .",

    "( 1998 ) have recently proposed the intriguing hypothesis that some of the observed hi - hvcs  in the sky are large ( diam@xmath725  kpc ) dark - matter - dominated clouds located within the local group .",
    "their argument for an extragalactic location for the clouds is based upon the good agreement between the velocity centroid of the cloud ensemble considered and that of the local group ( see blitz , this volume ) .",
    "they suggest that the milky way has accreted , and continues to accrete , such clouds .",
    "such an accretion could have profound implications for the physical state of the galactic halo and the chemical evolution of the galaxy , since the infalling gas clouds in this model typically have masses of @xmath1910@xmath22 m@xmath23 .",

    "some of this gas may have survived to the present day .",
    "the civ - hvcs  and some of the hi - hvcs  may be manifestations of such filamentary structures within the nearby universe",
    ". additional observations of civ - hvcs  along other sight lines would provide important insight into the viability of this hypothesis .",
    "the origins of hvcs have been debated for decades .",
    "the civ - hvcs  provide fundamentally new , and challenging , information that has not been available previously .",
    "while the civ - hvcs  trace mainly ionized gas , their study has applications for understanding neutral hvcs as well .",
    "we detect weak  emission within 2@xmath1 of the mrk509 sight line .",
    "the physical connection between the civ - hvcs  and the hi - hvcs   is still uncertain , though the relative proximity of the hi - hvcs  and the velocity similarities of the hi - hvcs  to the civ - hvcs   along the sight line suggests that the two types of hvcs are related .",
    "the simplest relationship would be one in which the civ - hvcs   trace the extended , ionized , low density regions of the hi - hvcs .",
    "there are several observations that could provide further insight into the nature of the civ - hvcs",
    ".      considerations of different scenarios for the production of h@xmath0 emission ( ferrara & field 1994 ; bland - hawthorn _ et al .  _ 1995 ; bland - hawthorn 1997 ) illustrate that it can be a powerful discriminator between an extragalactic and a galactic location for the civ - hvcs .",
    "the civ - hvcs  should have very low levels of h@xmath0 emission if the clouds are extragalactic entities photoionized by extragalactic background radiation .",
    "if , however , the clouds are local ( i.e. , in the milky way halo ) , h@xmath0 emission due to photoionization by starlight or collisional ionization produced by shocks would be strong and readily detectable ( i@xmath28@xmath410 mr ) .",
    "h@xmath0 emission with an intensity i@xmath28@xmath19100 mr is observed in many directions toward hvcs that are known to be located within 10 kpc of the galactic plane ( tufte , reynolds , & haffner 1998 ) . detectable line emission from gas as far away as the magellanic stream may be due to photoionization by photons escaping the galaxy ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1998 )      the best diagnostic of hot , collisionally ionized gas at ultraviolet wavelengths is the  doublet at 1031.93 , 1037.62  .",
    "the energy required to convert ov into  is 114 ev , well above the heii absorption edge at 54 ev and the ionization potential of ciii at 48 ev .",
    "a plasma that is radiatively cooling from @xmath1910@xmath29 k should have n()/n()@xmath19110 ( benjamin & shapiro 1999 ) . models for conductive interaces ( borkowski , balbus , & fristrom 1990 ) and evolved supernova remnants ( slavin & cox 1992 ; shelton 1998 ) yield similar ratios . if the civ - hvcs  are extragalactic clouds photoionized by background radiation , then the amount of  in the clouds should be roughly 12 orders of magnitude less than  in the absence of collisional processes .",
    "we will be able to search for  associated with the civ - hvcs  with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( see sembach , this volume ) . a column density",
    "n()=6.5@xmath1110@xmath30 @xmath13 will have an equivalent width of @xmath78 m , which is roughly the detection limit for s / n@xmath730 per fuse resolution element for an  line with a thermal broadening in 2@xmath1110@xmath31 k gas ( b=4.6 kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that cen & ostriker ( 1998 ) have recently proposed that as much as 50% of the baryons in the nearby universe may be in the form of hot ( t@xmath1910@xmath32 - 10@xmath33 k ) gas .",
    "thus , a test for the presence of in the civ - hvcs  could also place constraints on the amount of gas that exists in intergalactic clouds at temperatures of 10@xmath32 - 10@xmath29 k.      sembach _ et al .  _",
    "( 1999 ) identified two hvcs toward pks2155 - 304 ( @xmath34 ) that appear to have properties similar to those of the civ - hvcs  toward mrk509 .",
    "the clouds show  absorption with little  absorption .",
    "the velocities are lower than those of the mrk509 civ - hvcs   ( @xmath7@xmath9256 and @xmath35 kms@xmath5 ) , but are consistent with an extragalactic location .",
    "there is no detectable 21 cm emission at these velocities directly along the sight line , but mapping of the sky nearby reveals low column density hi - hvcs  similar to those near the mrk509 sight line .",
    "further ultraviolet observations of the civ - hvcs  toward pks2155 - 304 with the hst would allow stronger constraints to be placed on their ionization conditions .",
    "identification and investigation of additional civ - hvcs  along other sight lines would help constrain the typical kinematical properties and covering factors of the clouds , which could then be compared to those for higher redshift absorption systems .",
