    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an attractive solution to one of the most serious fine - tunings in nature , i.e. , it ensures the stability of the electroweak scale against radiative corrections .",
    "however , the susy standard model ( ssm ) may introduce other ( less severe ) fine - tunings , since some of the parameters in the ssm and/or their phases must be very small to avoid unwanted fcnc and cp violating processes .",
    "( these are called susy fcnc problem and susy cp problem . )    in gauge mediated susy breaking model  @xcite , the susy fcnc problem can be beautifully solved . in this scheme",
    ", the mechanism to mediate susy breaking to the ssm sector does not distinguish between flavors , and the universality of the scalar mass matrices is automatically guaranteed .",
    "however , the susy cp problem still remains .",
    "in particular , in gauge mediated model , the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron and neutron are likely to be larger than the current experimental constraint if the possible phases in the lagrangian are all @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is better to come up with some idea to suppress the cp violating phase in the gauge mediated model .    in the first half of this letter",
    ", we discuss the electron and neutron edms in the framework of the gauge mediated model , and derive a constraint on the cp violating phase . as a result",
    ", we will see that the edms are likely to be larger than the current experimental constraint if the cp violating phase is @xmath0 .",
    "then , in the second half , we consider a mechanism to suppress this cp violating phase so that the edms are within the experimental constraints .",
    "first , we discuss constraints on the phases in the gauge mediated model . in the gauge mediated model , all the off - diagonal elements in the sfermion mass matrices vanish .",
    "furthermore , so - called @xmath4-parameters are not generated at the one loop level .",
    "therefore , cp violating phases in these parameters are suppressed enough to be consistent with experimental constraints .",
    "however , ( some combinations of ) the phases in the gaugino masses , @xmath1-parameter , and @xmath2-parameter are physical , and in general , they can be large enough to conflict with experimental constraints .",
    "in particular , since the mechanism to generate @xmath1- and @xmath2-parameters are unknown , there is no guarantee of cancellation between their phases .",
    "let us discuss this issue in more detail .",
    "the relevant part of the lagrangian of the ssm can be written as @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the higgs fields coupled to the down - type and up - type quarks , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the gauginos for u(1)@xmath11 , su(2)@xmath12 , and su(3)@xmath13 gauge groups , respectively . in the above lagrangian , all the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath14 can be complex . however , by using phase rotations of higgs bosons , higgsinos , and gauginos , we can make some of them real . to be more specific ,",
    "denoting @xmath15 physical quantities depend only on the combination @xmath16    in the gauge mediated model , flavor symmetries are well preserved in the squark and slepton mass matrices , and susy contributions to the cp violation in fcnc processes are negligible . however , as discussed in many works  @xcite , the edms of the electron and neutron are important check points .",
    "indeed , non - vanishing @xmath17 may induce sizable edms .",
    "= 0.55    in order to discuss the constraint on @xmath17 , we calculate the electron edm @xmath18 in the framework of the gauge mediated model for several values of the messenger scale @xmath19 . in the calculation , we take @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of the vector - like messenger multiplet in units of @xmath23 representation of su(5)@xmath24 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : de ] .",
    "one should note that @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath25 , and hence we can estimate @xmath18 for other values of @xmath25 by rescaling the result given in fig .  [",
    "fig : de ] .",
    "furthermore , the edm of the electron is enhanced for larger values of @xmath26 .",
    "the mechanism of this enhancement is the same as those for other leptonic penguin diagrams such as for the muon magnetic dipole moment  @xcite and for lepton - flavor violating processes  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the electron edm comes from diagrams which are very similar to those for the muon @xmath27 , and those quantities are closely related in the gauge mediated model : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ssm contribution to the muon magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the experimental constraint on the electron edm is remarkably good . by using @xmath30  cm  @xcite",
    ", we obtain a constraint on the electron edm : @xmath31 where the right - hand side is the upper bound on @xmath18 at 90  %  c.l .    with the above constraint",
    ", we can derive a bound on @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath25 , the upper bound on @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 to @xmath35 , depending on the mass scale of the superparticles and @xmath36 .",
    "if we adopt relatively large value of the wino mass ( @xmath37 , depending on @xmath36 ) , @xmath17 can be as large as 0.1 , and it may not be a serious fine tuning .",
    "however , in this case , squarks and gluino become relatively heavy , and we may lose the motivation for low energy susy as a solution to the naturalness problem . on the other hand , if we consider lighter wino , @xmath17 is constrained to be less than @xmath38 , which requires more fine tuning of this phase . in the following , we consider a solution to this problem .    before discussing the model to suppress @xmath17 , we briefly comment on the constraint from the neutron edm @xmath39 .",
    "we can also obtain a constraint on @xmath17 from the neutron edm .",
    "however , the constraint is less severe because the experimental constraint on @xmath39 is not as stringent as that on @xmath18 , and also because the heavier squark masses suppress the theoretical value of @xmath39 . with the same underlying parameters , the constraint on @xmath17 is about a few times weaker from @xmath39 than from @xmath18",
    "let us consider a toy model in which @xmath17 vanishes automatically .",
    "we denote @xmath40 as the susy breaking field whose scalar and @xmath41-components acquire non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the vector - like messenger fields , and susy breaking parameters in the ssm sector are generated by integrating them out . in this section",
    ", we do not specify the mechanism that generates an @xmath41-component for @xmath40 , and we just adopt the following form of the superpotential : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the vev of the @xmath41-component for @xmath40 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are complex parameters , @xmath48 is a fixed integer , and @xmath49 is the reduced planck scale .    with the above superpotential , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath14",
    "are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the relevant gauge coupling constant for the standard model gauge group and @xmath52 is the group theoretical factor . from these expressions",
    ", we can easily see @xmath17 vanishes .",
    "in other words , all the phases in the lagrangian can be eliminated with phase rotations of the scalars , chiral fermions , and gauginos .",
    "therefore , in this case , there is no cp violation in the ssm ( except for the phase in the km matrix ) .",
    "however , this scenario is not phenomenologically viable , since the relative size of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-parameters is not in the required range .",
    "the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath1 is given by @xmath53 on the other hand , if @xmath54 , mass scale of the superparticles in the ssm sector is estimated as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the relevant gauge coupling constant of the standard model gauge groups .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath57 has to be of the order of 10 @xmath58 100  tev , where the lower bound is from the experimental constraint on the masses of the superparticles while the upper bound is from the naturalness point of view . as a result ,",
    "the ratio given in eq .",
    "( [ b / mu ] ) is about 2 @xmath58 3 orders of magnitude larger than the phenomenologically acceptable value  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this toy model does not work although it has the attractive feature of vanishing cp violating phase @xmath32 .",
    "now , we propose an improved model in which the ratio @xmath3 can be in the required range .",
    "one possibility to suppress the ratio @xmath3 is to introduce another field which also acquires a vev . if this new field couples to the higgs fields , and also if it can generate a large enough @xmath1-parameter , the ratio @xmath3 may be in the required range",
    "of course , if the vev of this new field has an arbitrary phase , the susy cp problem can not be solved .",
    "therefore , the new field has to be somehow related to the original susy breaking field @xmath40 .    in our model",
    ", we duplicate the susy breaking sector , and couple both of them to the higgs fields .",
    "then , if the susy breaking field in one sector has a larger vev than the other , the @xmath1-parameter is enhanced and the ratio @xmath3 can have a required value .",
    "furthermore , in order not to introduce a new phase which may spoil the cancellation in @xmath17 , we impose symmetry which interchanges these two sectors .",
    "if this symmetry is exact , however , the hierarchy between the vevs of the two susy breaking fields can not be generated .",
    "therefore , we introduce a ( small ) breaking parameter of this symmetry .",
    "there are two conflicting requirements on the breaking parameter .",
    "first , this breaking parameter has to be large enough so that the vev of one susy breaking field is about 2 @xmath58 3 orders of magnitude enhanced relative to the other . on the contrary , if this breaking parameter is too large , its cp violating phase may spoil the cancellation in @xmath17 .",
    "it is non - trivial to generate a large enough hierarchy with such a small breaking parameter .",
    "if the vev of the susy breaking field is determined by the inverted hierarchy mechanism  @xcite , however , small modifications of the parameters may significantly change the vev of the susy breaking field .",
    "in particular , in this class of models  @xcite , the potential of the susy breaking field is lifted only logarithmically , and a small perturbation at the planck scale can result in a significant change of the minimum of the potential . in this section",
    ", we use a simple model as an example , and see how the scenario mentioned above can work .",
    ".particle content of the model .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our discussion , we use a model based on @xmath59 ^ 3\\times [ su(2)']^3\\times su(5)_{g}}$ ] symmetry as an example , where the standard model gauge group @xmath60 is embedded in @xmath61 in the usual manner .",
    "( for the original susy breaking model based on the inverted hierarchy mechanism with @xmath59 ^ 3\\times su(5)_{g}}$ ] , see ref .",
    "we show the particle content of this model in table  [ table : example ] . here ,",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are strong gauge interactions which break supersymmetry , while @xmath64 s are introduced to stabilize the potentials for the susy breaking fields .    assuming a symmetry which interchanges the @xmath59 ^ 3}$ ] and @xmath65 ^ 3}$ ] sectors ( which we call @xmath66 symmetry ) , the superpotential has the following form : @xmath67 where the @xmath68 s are the breaking parameters of @xmath66 . if all @xmath68 s vanish , there is a @xmath66 symmetry .",
    "the symmetry breaking parameters @xmath68 s may arise from a vev of a field @xmath69 which transforms as @xmath70 under @xmath66 , for example .",
    "if @xmath69 has a coupling like @xmath71 a small @xmath72 can be generated if @xmath69 acquires a vev smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "similar arguments hold for other breaking parameters . here",
    ", we do not specify the origin of the symmetry breaking , and just assume they are somehow generated at the planck scale .    in this model ,",
    "susy is dynamically broken because of the quantum modified constraint  @xcite .",
    "concentrating on the flat direction parametrized as @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the superpotential becomes  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the strong scales of @xmath79 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "due to @xmath66 , we adopt @xmath80 . because of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 terms in the superpotential , @xmath40 and @xmath83 have vevs in @xmath41-components and the susy is broken .",
    "once @xmath40 and @xmath83 acquire vevs , three important parameters are given by @xmath84 then , denoting @xmath85 hierarchy between @xmath86 and @xmath87 can make the ratio @xmath3 to be in the required range .",
    "this is because , for @xmath88 , @xmath1- and @xmath2-parameters are dominated by the second term , while the gaugino mass is determined by the first one .",
    "adopting , for example , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , all the parameters in the ssm sector are in the required range . in the following ,",
    "we see how the vevs and their large hierarchy are generated .    at the tree level ,",
    "the potential for the susy breaking fields are completely flat and the minimum of the potential is undetermined .",
    "however , once we consider the wave function renormalization of the susy breaking fields , the potential has a minimum . denoting the wave function renormalization for @xmath93 and @xmath94 as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , the potential is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 therefore , the potential for the susy breaking field has a minimum when @xmath95 and @xmath96 are maximized .",
    "the minimum of the potential can be estimated by using the renormalization group equations ( rges ) . in our discussion , for simplicity , we take account of the effect of @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath99 being the gauge coupling constant for su(2)@xmath101 , and neglect the effects of other coupling constants .",
    "this approximation is motivated by the fact that @xmath100 plays the most important role among the yukawa coupling constants in determining the minimum of the potential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . then , @xmath102 is determined by solving @xmath103 similar argument holds for the potential of @xmath83 .",
    "since the scale dependence of the gauge and yukawa coupling constants are logarithmic , small modification of the boundary condition at the planck scale may result in a significant shift of the minimum of the potential . in our analysis , we solve the rges numerically to see how the minimum depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "for this purpose , we first fix @xmath99 and @xmath100 at the reduced planck scale @xmath104 . then , neglecting other coupling constants , we run them down to the low energy scale and find the scale @xmath86 where @xmath95 is maximized ( i.e. , the vev of @xmath40 ) . in fig .  [ fig : vevx ] , we show @xmath86 as a function of @xmath105 for several values of @xmath106 . as one can see",
    ", the vev of @xmath40 is sensitive to @xmath105 , and small modification of @xmath105 results in a large shift of the minimum of the potential .",
    "[ fig : vevx ] shows that @xmath86 and @xmath87 can differ by 2 @xmath58 3 orders of magnitude with a small breaking parameter of @xmath107 , depending on @xmath108 .",
    "notice that @xmath109 $ ] is approximately proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "for example , for @xmath110 , @xmath72 is required to be @xmath111 ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) for @xmath114 ( 0.4 , 0.5 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to make the ratio @xmath115 of the order of @xmath116 , @xmath72 has to be mildly tuned at @xmath117 level .",
    "we believe this is not a serious fine tuning .",
    "= 0.55    furthermore , most importantly , @xmath17 becomes suppressed in this model . in order to see this suppression",
    ", we have to know the phases of @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "so far , the phases of @xmath118 and @xmath119 are not determined , since they are related to the @xmath120-symmetry . in supergravity models",
    ", however , a constant term exists in the superpotential to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "this constant term does not respect the @xmath120-symmetry and fixes the phases  @xcite .",
    "the supergravity contributions to the potential are written as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a complex susy breaking parameter which is of the order of the gravitino mass . with this potential , for example , the phase of @xmath118 is determined so that the combination @xmath123 becomes real .",
    "then , the relative phase of @xmath118 and @xmath119 is given by @xmath124 therefore , these vevs are almost aligned irrespective of their absolute values .    by using eq",
    "( [ arg(x/x ) ] ) , @xmath17 is calculated as @xmath125 therefore , with the current constraint ( [ de_exp ] ) , the electron edm can be suppressed enough for mild values of @xmath36 ( less than about 10 ) with @xmath126 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : de ] ) .",
    "even if all the breaking parameters are of the same order , @xmath127 can induce large enough @xmath128 . for larger value of @xmath36 , @xmath129 as small as @xmath130",
    "is required .",
    "in fact , @xmath17 depends only on @xmath129 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ th_phys(eps ) ] ) , while @xmath72 plays the most important role in shifting the vev",
    ". therefore , if the breaking parameters may have hierarchy , requirements on the model are more relaxed .",
    "in particular , in the framework of supergravity , @xmath129 vanishes if @xmath131 vanishes and also if the khler potential respects @xmath66 symmetry . in this case",
    ", we avoid the constraint from the edms , and @xmath72 can be much larger than @xmath129 .",
    "for example , if the @xmath66 symmetry breaking field @xmath69 and the yukawa coupling @xmath100 have a non - trivial transformation property under some symmetry ( like @xmath120-symmetry ) , @xmath129 is expected to be @xmath132 , which can be suppressed for smaller @xmath100 .    in our discussion",
    ", we assumed that there is no effect of the @xmath66 symmetry breaking in the gauge kinetic function .",
    "if there is such an effect for the strong gauge groups su(2)@xmath133 and @xmath63 , the relative phase of @xmath77 and @xmath78 becomes @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the gauge coupling constant for the strong gauge groups . therefore , small symmetry breaking effect may induce a large shift of the relative phase of @xmath45 and @xmath136 , resulting in a large @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath66 symmetry breaking in the gauge kinetic function is disfavored .",
    "this effect can also be killed if non - trivial transformation properties for some symmetry are assigned for the symmetry breaking parameters .",
    "in the first half of this letter , we calculated the edm of the electron in the framework of the gauge mediated model . if all the phases in the lagrangian are @xmath0 , the electron edm is larger than the current experimental constraint .",
    "if all the superpaticles have masses of @xmath137 , for example , the cp violating phase @xmath17 has to be smaller than @xmath138 depending on @xmath36 .",
    "regarding this tuning as a problem , we considered a mechanism to suppress the cp violating phase .",
    "if the @xmath1- and @xmath2-parameters originate from the same coupling to the susy breaking field in the superpotential , the physical phase is cancelled out .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath3 becomes too large in a naive model .",
    "therefore , we introduced another sector to suppress this ratio . even with the new field",
    ", we have seen that the smallness of the physical phase @xmath17 can be realized by a symmetry .",
    "finally , we note that the strong cp problem can not be solved in our model .",
    "this feature is common to the case of the ssm , and some mechanism is needed to solve this problem , like peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite .",
