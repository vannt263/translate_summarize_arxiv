    "while the origin of the scale - free property can be reduced to two basic mechanisms : growth and preferential attachment , as exemplified by the barabsi - albert model ( ba model @xcite ) , the empirical result of fractality can not be explained only in those terms .",
    "notice that the term `` scale - free '' coined by barabsi - albert @xcite refers to the absence of a typical number of links , as exemplified by a power - law distribution of degree connectivity , but it does not refer to the length scale invariance found in @xcite .",

    "it is instructive to analyze the degree of correlation in networks considering the deviations of the joint probability distribution @xmath15 from the random uncorrelated scale - free case @xmath18 .",
    "this latter model is obtained by , for instance , random swapping of the links in a given network @xcite , so that the degree distribution is preserved , but the correlation is completely lost .",
    "the study of the ratio @xmath19 reveals that most of the networks such as metabolic and protein interaction networks , the internet and www are anticorrelated in comparison with the uncorrelated random case .",
    "this is because , even though this model is uncorrelated , there is still an effective attraction between the hubs since there is a large probability to randomly connect two nodes with large degrees .",

    "therefore this ratio does not allow to distinguish between fractal and non - fractal networks .    in search of uncovering the extent of anticorrelation that are needed to obtain fractals we study the ratios for different networks by using the www as a reference ( the use of any other network as a reference would lead to the same conclusions ) .",

    "this means that the metabolic network has less probability to have hub - hub connection ( two nodes with large degree connected ) than a hub - non hub connection , when compared to the www .",
    "therefore the metabolic network of e.coli is more anticorrelated than the www . in the same way ,",
    "[ kk]d shows that the hubs in the internet have more probability to connect with other hubs than in the www , and therefore the internet is less anticorrelated than the www .",

    "we modify the dynamical law of the model as follows : at each time step , @xmath219 number of links are added in at random , here @xmath220 is the total number of links at time @xmath45 , and @xmath221 is a constant that controls the fraction of noise .",

    "our analytical considerations predict a box dimension @xmath225 in the absence of noise . the numerical simulation ( see fig . [",
    "model - mb]b ) shows that this prediction of @xmath6 still fits well to the simulated data , except for a small deviation at large box sizes , i.e. the added noise appears as an approximate exponential tail at large distances .",
    "interestingly , this method could be used to test the appearance of noise in real complex networks , or to asses the quality of the data in , for instance , protein interaction networks obtained by yeast two - hybrid methods which are known to suffer from many false positives .",
    "most interestingly , the addition of noise leads to the small - world effect at the global level . in principle",
    "the existence of fractality seems to be at odds with the small - world effect .",
    "fractality implies a power - law dependence on the distance , while the small - world effect implies an exponential dependence @xcite . in fig .",

    "we add noise to the system and we find that the average distance @xmath226 over all pairs of vertices is @xmath227 ( fig .",
    "[ model - mb]c ) , indicating that the fractal model also predicts the global small - world .",
    "we notice that the fraction of short cuts needed to obtain the global small - world is very small , around @xmath228 .",
    "to compare the stability of fractal and non - fractal networks under intentional attack ( by removing hubs one by one from the largest to the smallest one ) , we generate two networks with @xmath196 and @xmath229 .",
    "in general the threshold of collapse under attack depends on several parameters and not only on the correlated properties of the network .",
    "since we wish to asses only the effects of anticorrelation for the vulnerability of the network , we set all the other parameters to be equal .",
    "thus , we use the same @xmath0 , @xmath230 , @xmath36 , and also the same number of loops in the structure . for this purpose",
    "we consider the number of intraloops inside the boxes and the number of interloops between boxes .    in practice , inside the box there are @xmath231 newly generated nodes .",
    "we add @xmath232 extra links between them to generate triangles ( @xmath233 is a given constant ) to obtain loops inside the boxes . for this case , we can rewrite @xmath234 , and the clustering coefficient @xmath235 . thus , this kind of loops give rise to the known scaling of the clustering coefficient with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "another type of loops appears when more than one link connects two boxes ( interloops ) .",
    "we find empirically that these kind of loops are also arranged in a self - similar way and are characterized by a new scaling exponent . in the framework of the minimal model ,",
    "this type of loops can be introduced by adding @xmath236 number of links between boxes at each time step , instead of keeping one link between boxes .",
    "these links could be of type mode ii ( i.e. , links between non - hubs ) , or otherwise could be between a hub from one box to a non - hub in the other node .",
    "in fact , this last mode of growth is a third mode that can be considered in the minimal model .",
    "we have not included it so far for simplicity , since it does not give rise to any new result . in general",
    "this mode could be thought of as a modified mode ii , and does not change the general conclusions of this study .",
    "combining the loop structure inside the boxes ( intraloops characterized by @xmath233 ) and between boxes ( interloops characterized by @xmath236 ) we obtain a general formula for the average degree @xmath237 . in the case of the minimal tree structure discussed in the main text we have @xmath238 and @xmath239 , which leads to @xmath240 , consistent with our previous arguments . these networks are then used to generate the structures used in the calculation of the vulnerability of networks under intentional attack , shown in fig .",

    "<S> * modularity. * the scale - invariant properties naturally lead to the appearance of a hierarchy of self - similar nested communities or modules . in this novel point of view , boxes represent nested modules of different length scales . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of modular structures is stressed in biological networks , where questions of function and evolutionary importance are put to the test @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant question is whether the self - similar hierarchy of boxes encodes the information about the functional modules in biological networks . to answer this question </S>",

    "<S> the main known biochemical classes of the substrates emerge naturally from the renormalization tree , indicating that the boxes capture the modular structure of the metabolic network of e. _ coli_. the same analysis reproduces the modular structure of the protein interaction network of the yeast further suggesting the validity of our analysis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * robustness. * finally our results suggest the importance of self - similarity in the evolution of the topology of networks . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the growth mechanism is of fundamental importance as it raises the question of its motivation in nature . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , given that systems in biology are fractal , there could be an evolutionary drive for the creation of such networks . </S>",
    "<S> a parameter relevant to evolution is the robustness of the network , which can be compared between fractal and non - fractal networks .    </S>",
    "<S> non - fractal scale - free networks , such as the internet , are extremely vulnerable to targeted attacks on the hubs @xcite . in such non - fractal topologies , the hubs are connected and form a central compact core ( as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kk]b ) , such that the removal of few largest hubs ( those with the largest degree ) has catastrophic consequences for the network @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fractal property of networks significantly increases the robustness against targeted attacks since the hubs are more dispersed in the network ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ kk]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ modular]c shows a comparison of robustness between a fractal and non - fractal network . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison is done between model networks of the same @xmath66 , the same number of nodes ( 74,000 ) , the same number of links , the same amount of loops and the same clustering coefficient ( see supplementary materials section [ attack ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the difference in the robustness seen in this figure is attributed solely to the different degree of anticorrelation . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the relative size of the largest cluster , @xmath67 , and the average size of the remaining isolated clusters , @xmath68 , after removing a fraction @xmath69 of the largest hubs for both networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while both networks collapse at a finite fraction @xmath70 , evidenced by the decrease of @xmath67 toward zero and the peak in @xmath71 , the fractal network has a significantly larger threshold ( @xmath72 ) compared to the non - fractal threshold ( @xmath73 ) suggesting a significantly higher robustness of the fractal modular networks to failure of the highly connected nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this could explain why evolutionary constraints on biological networks have led to fractal architectures . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the comparison in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ modular]c is between two networks which preserve the modularity . </S>",
    "<S> our results should be understood as follows : given that a network has a modular structure , then the most robust network is the one with fractal topology . </S>",
    "<S> there are other ways to increase robustness by , for instance , fully connecting the hubs in a central core @xcite , but this arrangement does not preserve the modularity .    * </S>",
    "<S> summary. * we find that the statistical properties of many real networks are well consistent with the predictions of the proposed multiplicative model . </S>",
    "<S> networks that can be captured by our theoretical framework include fractal networks ( www , protein interactions , metabolic networks and some collaboration networks ) and the non - fractal networks such as the internet . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the proposed framework is supported by the predicted scaling exponents ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath55 ) in many real networks as well as the general properties of the connectivity distribution captured by @xmath15 and the scaling relationships predicted by the multiplicative growth process of our model . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that nodes are organized around dispersed hubs in self - similar nested modules @xcite characterized by different functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> these then compartmentalize the hubs @xcite , and protect them from a failure at the system level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , these modules function relatively autonomously so that a failure in one module can not propagate easily to the next . </S>",
    "<S> this may provide a significantly higher protection against intentional attacks reducing the high vulnerability the achilles heel of non - fractal scale - free networks .    </S>",
