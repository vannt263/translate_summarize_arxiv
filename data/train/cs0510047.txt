    "in mimo ( multiple input multiple output ) systems space time coding schemes have been proven to be an appropriate tool to exploit the spatial diversity gains .",
    "two distinct scenarios are common , whether the channel coefficients are known ( coherent scenario ) @xcite , to the receiver or not ( non - coherent scenario ) @xcite .",
    "prominent coherent codes are the well known alamouti scheme @xcite and general orthogonal designs @xcite .",
    "a more flexible coding scheme are the so - called linear dispersion codes .",
    "they have been introduced in @xcite and were further investigated in @xcite . a full rate high performing example is the recently discovered golden code @xcite .",
    "genuine non - coherent codes have been proposed in @xcite , but most of the research efforts in the literature focus on differential schemes , introduced in @xcite , since differential codes usually provide higher data rates than comparable non differential codes .",
    "high performing examples have been constructed in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . however , in both ( coherent and non - coherent ) cases most research effort has been undertaken for space time block codes with quadratic 2-by-2 , resp .",
    "@xmath1-by-@xmath1  code matrices ( @xmath1  denotes the number of transmit antennas ) .",
    "although linear dispersion codes are not restricted to quadratic shape of the design matrices the block length is not a free design parameter when the number of transmit antennas is held fixed ( compare the asymptotic guidelines in @xcite ) .    in general @xcite",
    "the signal matrices are of rectangular shape of size @xmath2 with unitary columns .",
    "the corresponding coding spaces for the coherent and non - coherent scenario are the complex stiefel and grassmann manifolds respectively .",
    "typically the number @xmath3 of transmit antennas is a small number due to hardware limitations , while the block length @xmath4 can be chosen rather large , upper bounded only by the coherence length of the channel .",
    "inspired from @xcite , in @xcite a general analysis of packings in the stiefel and grassmann manifold revealed , that the achievable squared minimal distance ( i.e. the squared diameter of the decision regions for decoding ) grows proportionally with the block length @xmath4 , more precisely the following proposition holds @xcite ) :    [ prop.dmin-lowerbound]0.75cm1 + for any @xmath5 set @xmath6 ( coherent channel ) , resp .",
    "@xmath7 ( non - coherent channel ) . then for any prescribed rate @xmath8 there",
    "exist space time block codes @xmath9 with rate @xmath10 and minimal distance @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 for some constant @xmath13 depending on the channel knowledge at the receiver . since the rightmost term is monotonically increasing as a function of @xmath14 , the receiver performance increases proportionally to @xmath15 .",
    "having the common literature ( see above ) in mind , this result comes rather unexpected and further research effort seems promising .",
    "however , explicit code constructions have already been achieved in @xcite . moreover",
    ", the proposition [ prop.dmin-lowerbound ] becomes even more important when considering space frequency code design : the schemes @xcite , @xcite indicate , that the relevant coding spaces are certain subsets of ( large dimensional ) stiefel and grassmann manifolds .",
    "thus considering these coding spaces in general may be of considerable importance for space frequency code designs .",
    "explicit space frequency constructions can be found in e.g. @xcite .    in the present work it will be shown , how general space time block code designs can be decomposed into two smaller pieces with reduced design complexity ( theorem [ thm.code-diversity-compose ] ) , both already in the focus of current research .",
    "the achieved result can be seen as complementary to that of kammoun and belfiore @xcite , who presented a coding scheme for non - coherent channel space time block codes in terms of coherent channel ones , compare remark [ rem.tower ] for further implications .",
    "the key observation is the quite intuitive but technically not obvious diversity monotonicity ( proposition [ prop.code-embedding ] ) , which states that the performance of each non - coherent channel space time block code grows when considered as a coherent channel code .",
    "this turns out to be due to some higher resolution of the coherent channel receiver , reflecting the information theoretic relation between the system designs .",
    "further insight on the performance is obtained by local analysis of diversity , leading to the overall picture of space time coding as a constrained sphere packing problem .",
    "it reveals additional structures not obvious from the traditional point of view , proposing high performance design criteria ( conclusion [ conc.cg-points ] , [ conc.cg-points-in-v ] ) and adding a further estimate ( proposition [ prop.explicit-embedding-bounds ] ) to the diversity embedding . by the way all results are obtained in the spirit of geometrical methods in space time coding theory .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s.models ] introduces the basic models for the channels and coding spaces ( with emphasis on their geometrical structures ) , fixes notation and conventions used throughout this work .",
    "section [ s.performance-embedding ] defines diversities for the coherent / non - coherent channel cases as our fundamental performance measure and analyses their interrelations , culminating in the embedding and decomposition results mentioned above .",
    "section [ s.extremal-diversity ] focuses on the local analysis of diversity and the connection to the sphere packing problem , exploring its consequences .",
    "finally , the main results will be summarized for concise reference together with remaining open questions .",
    "in this section the basic channel model will be presented , leading to the stiefel and grassmann manifolds as coding spaces .",
    "these spaces will be introduced with emphasis on their topological metric structures induced by the maximum likelihood receivers .",
    "the geometric relation between the coding spaces is precisely expressed by the principal fiber structure , which is also introduced here . although the geometric terms used in this work will be defined ( as far as it seems necessary to understand the concepts ) ,",
    "the reader who prefers rigorous definitions is invited to consult standard text books e.g. @xcite ( manifolds ) , @xcite ( homogeneous spaces , lie groups ) , and/or @xcite ( principal fibers ) . for the particular case of the ( complex ) stiefel and grassmann",
    "manifolds an introduction to their real counterparts aimed at non - specialists is @xcite .",
    "we consider the rayleigh flat fading mimo ( multiple input multiple output ) channel without channel knowledge at the transmitter and maximum likelihood decoding at the receiver as described in @xcite ( with normed expected power @xmath16 per time step , @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes expectation ) : @xmath19 whereas @xmath20 denotes the coherence time of the channel ( respectively the block length of the signals ) , @xmath21 denote the number of transmit , resp .",

    "hochwald and marzetta ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 and 2 ) have shown , that signals @xmath30 of the form @xmath31 are optimal with respect to the channel capacity ( due to the central limit theorem tending to @xmath32 defined below , when @xmath33 ) , if the receiver does not know the channel .",

    "this is reflected by the fact , that scalings and linear combinations of the columns of @xmath38 are indistinguishable for the detector , when the channel is non - coherent .",
    "therefore these transformations can not carry any information and we end up with signals @xmath51 , @xmath52denoting the complex grassmann manifold of @xmath3-dimensional linear subspaces of @xmath50 .    for the coherent channel the capacity has been calculated by telatar @xcite to @xmath53 assuming the same energy allocation @xmath54 one can justify , that now the asymptotically optimal signal space consists of signals @xmath55 .",
    "we focus on both signal designs in this article , sometimes called unitary space time modulation in the literature ( introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "the ( complex ) stiefel manifold defined by @xmath57 is diffeomorphic to a coset space with respect to the unitary group @xmath58 of @xmath14-by-@xmath14unitary matrices : @xmath59 whereas @xmath60 means diffeomorphic to. from this equivalence we obtain @xmath61{\\overset{\\rule[-0.5pt]{0.75ex}{0.25pt}}{d}}}_{{\\ensuremath{n_t}},{\\ensuremath{t}\\xspace } } & { : = } \\operatorname{\\dim_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathds{r}}}}}{{\\ensuremath{v^{{\\ensuremath{\\mathds{c}}}}_{{\\ensuremath{n_t}},{\\ensuremath{t}\\xspace}}}}\\xspace}=\\operatorname{\\dim_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathds{r}}}}}{\\ensuremath{u({\\ensuremath{t}\\xspace})}\\xspace}-\\operatorname{\\dim_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathds{r}}}}}u({\\ensuremath{t}\\xspace}-{\\ensuremath{n_t}})\\\\                      & = { \\ensuremath{n_t}}(2{\\ensuremath{t}\\xspace}-{\\ensuremath{n_t } } ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] for free .",
