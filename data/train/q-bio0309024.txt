    "synchronous activity has been observed in many regions of the brain and has been implicated as a correlate of behavior and cognition  @xcite . in the hippocampal formation , where such activity has been studied most thoroughly , neurons discharge in several behaviorally important synchronous rhythms  @xcite . among these patterns",
    "are the theta ( 4 - 12 hz ) and gamma ( @xmath4 hz ) rhythms , which appear as nested rhythms under conditions of active exploration and paradoxical sleep , as well as hippocampal sharp waves ( @xmath5 hz ) , which occur along with embedded fast ripples ( @xmath6 hz ) under conditions of rest and slow wave sleep  @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate some mechanisms responsible for generating synchronous oscillations throughout the physiologically relevant range of frequencies ( 10 - 200 hz ) .",
    "two crucial results point to the importance of inhibitory interneurons in generating synchronous rhythms in the hippocampal formation .",
    "first , it has been shown in intact animals that interneurons fire robustly and synchronously in both the theta - gamma state and in the sharp wave - ripple state  @xcite .",
    "second , _ in vitro _",
    "experiments have demonstrated that a functional network containing interneurons alone can support synchronous gamma activity  @xcite .",
    "these and other experimental results have spurred both analytic  @xcite and numerical  @xcite studies of synchrony among neurons . among the principal conclusions of such studies",
    "are that stable synchrony is supported by inhibition that is slow compared with neuronal firing rates ; and that firing rate decays linearly , eventually saturating , as a function of the decay time constant of inhibition ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "when the synaptic coupling is extremely fast , the coupling tends to push the neurons towards anti - synchrony  @xcite .",
    "synchronous oscillations generated _ in vivo _ are almost certainly the product of interactions among neurons with some ( unknown ) degree of heterogeneity in excitatory drive and intrinsic excitability .",
    "much of the earlier work in the area has not explored the effects of heterogeneity in intrinsic spike rates  @xcite .",
    "et al._(1993 ) considered a network of integrate - and - fire oscillators with heterogeneous external drive and all - to - all _ excitatory _ coupling .",
    "they found that for an infinite number of oscillators , those with an external drive below a critical value would be synchronized and those above the critical value would be asynchronous .",
    "this co - existence around the critical value persisted in the limit of vanishing heterogeneity .",
    "golomb and rinzel ( 1993 ) considered a heterogeneous network of all - to - all coupled inhibitory bursting neurons and found regimes of synchronous , anti - synchronous and asynchronous behavior when the width of the heterogeneity was changed .",
    "they considered a parameter regime that was synchronous for small heterogeneity .",
    "wang and buzski  ( 1996 ) considered a hippocampal interneuron network with heterogeneity in the external drive and network connectivity .",
    "they found numerically that for a physiologically plausible parameters , coherent activity is only possible in the gamma range of frequencies .",
    "our purpose here is to understand more fully the implications of small levels of heterogeneity for the degradation of synchrony in networks of inhibitory fast spiking neurons and the mechanisms by which this degradation occurs . to this end",
    ", we have begun a coordinated set of analytic and numerical studies of the problem . in this paper",
    ", we numerically analyze a network of interneurons applicable to the ca1 region of the hippocampus .",
    "we consider slow inhibition and heterogeneity in the external drive .",
    "we find that small amounts of heterogeneity in the external drive can greatly reduce coherence .",
    "in addition , we find that coherence can be reduced in two qualitatively different ways depending on the parameters  either by a transition to _ asynchrony _ where the cells fire independently of each other , or through _ suppression _ where faster cells suppress slower cells .",
    "the reaction of a network to heterogeneity is shown in the paper to be correlated with the dependence of firing frequency on the time constant of synaptic decay .",
    "we find in self - inhibiting cells or synchronous networks that this dependence divides into two asymptotic regimes . in the first ( the tonic - inhibition or _ tonic _",
    "regime ) , inhibition acts as if it were steady - state and only weakly affects discharge frequency . in the second ( the phasic - inhibition or _",
    "phasic _ regime ) , time - varying inhibition firmly controls discharge frequency . there is a gradual crossover between these regimes .",
    "the presence of a neuron or network in the tonic or phasic regime can most easily be determined by examining the ratio of the synaptic decay time constant to discharge period ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "( discharge period @xmath1 can be obtained from the full network or from a reduced model including only a single cell with self - inhibition . )",
    "@xmath0 is large ( @xmath8 for our parameters ) and varies linearly with @xmath7 in the tonic regime .",
    "@xmath0 is small ( @xmath9 ) and only logarithmically dependent on @xmath7 in the phasic regime .",
    "however , if @xmath7 is _ too _ small ( @xmath10 ) , the phasic regime is departed and anti - synchrony is possible",
    ". networks of weakly heterogeneous ( less than 5% ) cells generally exhibit asynchrony ( defined here as the state of phase dispersion ) in the tonic regime . in the phasic regime",
    ", cells generally exhibit a form of locking , including synchrony , harmonic locking ( locking at rational ratios ) , and suppression .",
    "these results can be demonstrated analytically using a reduced model with mutual and self - inhibition  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that mild heterogeneity in inhibitory networks adds effects that are not accounted for in previous analyses , but that are tractable under our current framework .",
    "in particular , we show that the prediction that slow inhibition leads to synchrony , made under assumptions of homogeneity  @xcite , must be modified in the presence of mild heterogeneity .",
    "thus , the new framework provides a context for understanding previous simulations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it explains the mechanisms underlying asynchrony ( phase dispersion ) with slow decay of inhibition .",
    "these mechanisms differ from those underlying the loss of synchrony with faster - decaying inhibition .",
    "simulations were carried out using single - compartment neurons with inhibitory synapses obeying first - order kinetics .",
    "membrane potential in each point neuron obeyed the current balance equation @xmath11 where @xmath12f/@xmath13 , @xmath14 is the applied current , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the hodgkin - huxley type spike generating currents , @xmath17 is the leak current and @xmath18 is the synaptic current .",

    "these parameters are within physiological ranges and give the high spike rates typical of hippocampal interneurons .",

    "the odes were integrated using a fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the free parameters were scanned across the following ranges : for applied current @xmath14 , 0 - 10 @xmath39a/@xmath13 ; for @xmath40 , the maximal synaptic conductance per cell , 0 - 2  ms/@xmath13 ; for the synaptic decay time constant @xmath7 , 5 - 50  ms .",
    "as a measure of coherence between pairs of neurons , we generated trains of square pulses from the time domain responses of each of the cells ( fig .",
    "[ coho_ex_fig ] ) .",
    "each pulse , of height unity , was centered at the time of a spike peak ( resolution = 0.1 ms ) ; the width of the pulse was 20% of the mean firing period of the faster cell in the pair ( 0.2  @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ coho_ex_fig ] ) .",
    "we then took the cross - correlation at zero time lag of these pulse trains .",
    "this is equivalent to calculating the shared area of the unit - height pulses , as shown in fig .",
    "[ coho_ex_fig]d .",
    "we took coherence as the sum of these shared areas , divided by the square root of the product of the summed areas of each individual pulse train .",
    "for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ coho_ex_fig ] , our algorithm gives coherence of 0.35 .",
    "our approach differs from the algorithm used by wang and buzski  ( 1996 ) , in which trains of unit - height pulses are correlated for a bin width equal to or greater than the neuronal time scale .",
    "the difference between the two algorithms can be appreciated by considering the contribution made to the coherence measure by two spikes ( in two separate neurons ) occurring with time difference @xmath42 .",
    "the wang and buzski ( 1996 ) algorithm would see these as perfectly coherent if the spikes are in the same time bin and incoherent if they are not .",
    "the answer depends on where the bin edges fall , with probability of a coherence `` hit '' falling to zero when the bin width is less than @xmath42 . in their algorithm coherence is a function of the bin width , and averaging across the population of cells ameliorates effects due to the placement of bin edges . in our algorithm ,",
    "the two spikes make a contribution to coherence that is continuously distributed between 0 ( @xmath43 20% of firing period ) and 1 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "although both algorithms give results that depend on the percentage of the firing period considered significant , our measure allows us to examine coherence in small networks with less discretization error .",
    "this change is important here specifically because we analyze small networks that phase - lock with a short but measurable phase difference .",
    "we mapped coherence vs. @xmath14 , @xmath40 , and @xmath7 for networks of 2 , 10 , and 100 cells with all - to - all inhibitory coupling . in networks with @xmath45",
    ", coherence is plotted in the maps . in larger networks ,",
    "the plots show the average of the coherence measure taken for all pairs of neurons .",
    "we first consider the firing characteristics of a single self - inhibited neuron or , equivalently , a network of identical , synchronized , mutually inhibitory neurons .",
    "these simulations validate predictions from analytic work on simpler models  @xcite and determine the ranges of the phasic and tonic regimes in parameter space .",
    "firing frequency of the single neuron was tracked over the parameter space of @xmath14 , @xmath40 , and @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ 1cell_fig]a shows sample time - domain traces for three values of @xmath14 ( 0.4 , 1.6 and 9.0 @xmath39a/@xmath13 ) . like mammalian interneurons , the modeled system of differential equations produces action potentials at rates up to 250 hz .",
    "figure [ 1cell_fig]b shows discharge frequency as a function of @xmath14 , for several values of @xmath40 . for large values of @xmath40 ( lower traces ) , this curve is roughly linear . for smaller values ( upper traces ) ,",
    "discharge frequency rises along a somewhat parabolic trajectory . for negative values of @xmath14 ,",
    "the self - inhibited neuron can fire at arbitrarily low frequencies ( data not shown ) , indicative of a saddle - node bifurcation and synchrony through slow inhibition  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ 1cell_fig]c we show discharge frequency versus @xmath7 for several values of @xmath14 , with @xmath40 fixed .",
    "the dependence of the frequency on @xmath7 for the lower two traces is similar to what was observed in the full network and _ in vitro _ by whittington _",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the phasic and tonic regimes are clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 1cell_fig]d , in which the ratio @xmath0 is plotted versus @xmath7 for various values of @xmath14 . for large @xmath14 ( top traces )",
    ", @xmath0 is large and linearly related to @xmath7 , indicative of the tonic regime .",
    "in contrast , for small @xmath14 ( bottom trace ) , @xmath0 is small and depends only weakly on @xmath7 , indicative of the phasic regime .",
    "for our model and level of heterogeneity , parameter sets that give @xmath3 are in the phasic regime ; sets that give @xmath2 are in the tonic regime .",
    "presence in either the phasic or tonic regime is dependent on parameters other than @xmath14 .",
    "generally , the tonic regime is characterized by strong applied current and a relatively weak synapse so that the firing period is much faster than the synaptic decay time .",
    "the phasic regime occurs when either the applied current is weak and/or the synapse is strong so that the firing period is locked to the decay time .",
    "we simulated networks of two mutually inhibitory cells with self - inhibition .",
    "we include self - inhibition because it better mimics the behavior of a large network . in these and all other network simulations , mutual and self - inhibition are of equal weight . in networks of two interneurons with identical properties but different initial conditions ,",
    "the cells quickly synchronize ( phase - lock with zero phase difference ) over the entire examined range of @xmath14 , @xmath40 , and @xmath7 ( data not shown ) .",
    "slow - firing cells tend to synchronize more quickly than fast - firing cells , but the exact delay before synchronization depends on initial conditions and was not examined systematically . anti - synchrony is not stable in the parameter regime we considered , but could be with very small values of @xmath7 .",
    "when the input @xmath14 to each neuron is made mildly heterogeneous ( intrinsic spike rates @xmath46 5% different ) , a more complex picture emerges . under the conditions of mild heterogeneity modeled here , but not necessarily under conditions of greater heterogeneity  @xcite , the behavior of the two - cell network falls into one of four qualitative states , as exemplified by the traces of membrane potential and inhibitory conductance vs. time in fig .",

    "we will continue to use the term synchrony to refer to this near - synchronous regime . for this model , heterogeneity of some sort",
    "( in this case , heterogeneity of intrinsic firing frequencies ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for near , as opposed to pure , synchrony  @xcite .",
    "the size of the phase difference depends on the parameters chosen . with further increases in the level of inhibition ,",
    "the faster cell begins to suppress its slower partner , leading to what we term _ harmonic locking _",
    "[ domains_fig]c ) . in this example",
    ", cells fire in a 4:3 ratio , and exert temporally complex effects on each other during the course of one cycle ( @xmath48 50 ms ) .",
    "finally , with enough inhibition , the faster neuron inhibits its slower counterpart totally , in what we term _ suppression _ ( fig .",
    "[ domains_fig]d ) . in suppression ,",
    "the sub - threshold dynamics of membrane potential in the suppressed cell are exactly phase locked to those of the faster cell .",
    "this exact relationship holds because our simulations do not include a synaptic delay term .    without self - inhibition",
    ", this harmonic - locking regime is very small and not seen in the analogous parameter space ( data not shown ) .",
    "our heuristic explanation for this difference is as follows . without self - inhibition ,",
    "once the slower neuron is suppressed , the instantaneous preferred frequencies of the two cells diverge .",
    "the faster cell is uninhibited and , by firing faster , adds more inhibition to the slower cell , making it more difficult for the slower cell to escape . with self - inhibition ,",
    "each of the cells in the two - cell network receives an identical synaptic signal , effectively making the two cells more homogeneous .",
    "the added homogeneity increases the size of the region in which harmonic locking occurs at relatively small locking ratios .    in order to observe network behavior over a large parameter range",
    ", we used the relatively simple measure of firing coherence ( see methods ) .",
    "a given level of coherence does not uniquely determine the qualitative behavior of the network ( asynchronous , synchronous , harmonic , or suppressed ) .",
    "however , the structures of coherence maps are stereotyped , and coherence maps can be correlated to the four qualitative network states .",
    "figures  [ coho_fig]a - b show three dimensional plots of coherence in a two - cell network , plotted versus @xmath7 and @xmath40 for low ( @xmath49 and @xmath50a/@xmath13 ) and high ( @xmath51 and @xmath52a/@xmath13 ) applied currents .",

    "the extent of the synchronous region increases as @xmath7 decreases . increasing the heterogeneity reduces the size of the synchronous region . for differences greater than a few percent in the intrinsic ( uncoupled ) frequencies , the synchronous region",
    "was dramatically reduced in size ( data not shown ) .    for a given @xmath7 ,",
    "synchrony is broken in two distinct ways if @xmath40 is either too small or too large . for large @xmath14 , large @xmath7 , and ( especially ) small @xmath40 ,",
    "the phasic coupling between the two cells is weak and they fire asynchronously ( i.e. , with dispersed phase ) . in this state , which is particularly large on the left side of fig .",
    "[ coho_fig]b , coherence has a value of about 0.2 , corresponding to the expected value of our coherence measure with `` memory '' equal to 20% of the spiking period . for large @xmath40 , high levels of coherence",
    "are lost when the faster cell begins to suppress the slower cell , resulting in harmonic spiking .",
    "the particular pattern of harmonic spiking can change dramatically with small changes in parameters , resulting in the jagged coherence regions seen in figs .",
    "[ coho_fig]a - b .",
    "again , the harmonic region is particularly noticeable with large @xmath14 , as in fig .",
    "[ coho_fig]b .    eventually , with large enough @xmath40 , the full suppression state can take hold , and coherence plummets to give a very flat region of coherence at a value of 0 .",
    "this state , favored by large @xmath40 and large @xmath7 , occupies a large region on the right side of fig .",
    "[ coho_fig]a .",
    "we argued in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ domains_fig ] that the network s presence in the asynchronous state is associated with the tonic regime , and that the transition from asynchrony to locking is associated with the transition from the tonic regime to the phasic regime . to demonstrate this effect ,",
    "we have gray - scale - coded the coherence maps of fig .",
    "[ coho_fig ] according to the value of @xmath0 obtained from single , self - inhibited cells with the same values of @xmath7 and total inhibition @xmath40 and @xmath14 taken as the average of the range seen in the heterogeneous population .",

    "this result is demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ compare_n ] , which shows plots of @xmath0 for four conditions : the n = 1 case ( solid lines ) , the n = 2 case with differences in intrinsic rates of around 4% ( dashed lines ) and 2% ( dashed - and - dotted lines ) ; and the n = 10 case with maximal heterogeneity of around 4% ( dotted lines ) . in all cases with more than one cell , a pair of traces corresponding to the fastest and slowest cells of the simulations are shown . in all cases ,",

    "we show that the behavior of the firing frequency of a single self - inhibited cell can give insight into the network frequency and coherence .",
    "in particular , the ratio of the synaptic decay constant @xmath7 to the neuronal firing period @xmath1 has rough predictive value in determining whether a mildly heterogeneous network is synchronous or asynchronous .",
    "this predictive value only holds with mild heterogeneity , however ; greater heterogeneity leads to a mixture of qualitative states  @xcite which invalidates our analyses .",
    "we also emphasize the importance of even mild heterogeneity in affecting network dynamics .",
    "previously , it had been argued that slowly decaying inhibition generally had a synchronizing influence  @xcite .",
    "however , for mildly heterogeneous cells , the relation of the frequency ( or period ) to the synaptic decay time must also be considered . for homogeneous cells ,",

    "it occurs only when the inhibition is strong enough so that firing period is dominated by the decay time .",
    "however , if the inhibition is too strong then the slower cells will never fire .",
    "thus , there are two ways to destroy full network synchrony .",
    "the first is through effective de - coupling where the cells tend to fire asynchronously .",
    "the second is through suppression , in which the neurons with higher intrinsic rates fire in near - synchrony and keep their slower counterparts from firing . between synchrony and suppression harmonic locking",
    "is also possible .",
    "this occurs when the suppression of the slower cell is temporary but lasts longer than the period of the faster cell .",
    "we should note that anti - synchrony , not seen in the parameter regimes presented here , can become stable with very fast synapses ( i.e. , @xmath62 )  @xcite .    for even mildly heterogeneous cells , synchrony",
    "in which all inhibitory cells participate is possible only over a small region of parameter space that decreases as the heterogeneity is increased .",
    "the region where synchrony occurs in a large network of known ( mild ) heterogeneity and connectivity can be approximated from a two - cell network .",
    "the frequency of firing and conditions allowing synchrony can be estimated analytically from a reduced model neuron with self - inhibition  @xcite as in large networks  @xcite , the frequency in single cells depends on the applied current , the synaptic strength and the synaptic decay time . in the synchronous region ,",
    "the firing period depends linearly on the decay time and logarithmically on the other parameters so that frequency will depend directly on the decay rate .",

    "this can be estimated analytically from the reduced model  @xcite , or from simple simulations of a single , self - inhibiting cell ( see fig .  [ 1cell_fig ] ) .",
    "the result that the value of @xmath0 from single - cell simulations has predictive value for the qualitative state and coherence of a network of arbitrary size is intriguing and potentially useful , because it points the way to determining the qualitative and quantitative behavior of a neuronal network based on simple behavior that can be studied numerically or even analytically .",
    "however , the predictive capabilities of this index should not be overestimated .",
    "a careful examination of fig .  [ coho_fig ] shows that the mapping between @xmath0 and asynchrony is not precise .",
    "the value of @xmath0 at which the transition will occur is dependent on many factors , including the level of heterogeneity and , in all likelihood , the level and form of connectivity in the network .",
    "the value of @xmath0 alone is not sufficient to determine the point of transition from synchrony to harmonic locking and suppression , even in a model of known heterogeneity and architecture .",
    "making this determination requires knowledge of @xmath14 and @xmath40 in addition to @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "studies of the 2-cell network were successful in elucidating the qualitative states of the larger circuit , though the exact form of transitions from asynchrony to synchrony and synchrony to suppression is different in detail for our simulations of the 2-cell and n - cell cases . in general",
    ", the behavior of the 2-cell network matches that of the n - cell circuit better in the asynchronous state , associated with the tonic regime , than in the harmonic and suppression states , associated with the phasic regime .",
    "this result is expected from our theoretical framework since the tonic regime is defined as the regime in which only the tonic level of inhibition is important . since we normalized the synaptic strength by n , the net amount of inhibition is independent of the network size .",
    "thus , we take this result as additional evidence that our hypothesized mechanisms of loss of coherence are correct .",
    "our numerical results are similar to those of wang and buzski  ( 1996 ) , but our explanations differ considerably . in heterogeneous networks",
    ", they also saw a decline in coherence with both low and high firing rates .",
    "they attributed the decline in synchrony for low rates to two factors .",
    "first , they point out that cells are more sensitive at low firing rates than at higher rates to changes in applied current , a source of heterogeneity in both studies .",
    "this point is correct , but in our work we controlled for this factor , using smaller percent differences in small currents than in large currents to achieve similar percent differences in intrinsic firing rates , and we still saw a drop - off in coherence at low rates .",
    "second , wang and buzski ( 1996 ) cite what they call a `` dynamical '' effect , in which inhibition is fast enough to destabilize the synchronous state .",
    "previous work  @xcite shows that the outcome of such dynamical effects for _ homogeneous _ networks is anti - synchrony . in our parameter regime ,",
    "the loss of coherence in _ heterogeneous _ networks at low firing rates ( i.e. , with @xmath0 small ) is associated with the phasic regime and is due to suppression of firing in slower cells .",
    "wang and buzski  ( 1996 ) make the phenomenological argument that the loss of synchrony at high firing rates is related to a need for greater density of synaptic connectivity .",
    "we considered all - to - all connectivity and found that loss of coherence associated with high firing rates ( tonic regime ) is caused by a loss of too much of the phasic component of inhibition .",
    "furthermore , we argue that one can approximate the parameters for which this loss of coherence occurs by analyzing the single , self - inhibitory cell",
    ". it should be possible to generalize these results and arguments to the case with less than all - to - all coupling .",
    "it has been suggested that the selection of the network frequency _ in vivo _ is determined by the tonic excitation and the parameters regulating the synaptic coupling  @xcite .",
    "our results support this hypothesis .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that with heterogeneous cells , synchrony may not be possible at all frequencies . in particular , a network of this kind seems unlikely to support synchronous firing at 200 hz , a frequency that seems too fast to be synchronized by gaba@xmath63 receptors with @xmath64 ms ( and @xmath65 ) .",
    "our framework implies that this result , which has been seen in simulations before  @xcite , holds in general for heterogeneous cells in the tonic regime .",
    "our results emphasize the difficulty of generating synchronous oscillations in interneuronal networks over a large range of frequencies , such as in the transition from the gamma / theta mode to the sharp wave / fast ripples mode . at gamma frequencies ,",
    "the factor @xmath0 should be less than 1 with typical values of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , full synchrony at gamma frequencies is possible but requires careful regulation of the system to prevent suppressive effects .",
    "the question of whether or not the suppression we see is incompatible with physiological data can not be answered , because it is extremely difficult to estimate the number of interneurons participating in the rhythm .",
    "we believe that this issue can be explored , and our model tested , by examining the power of the gamma field potential in a brain slice as @xmath7 is modified by pentobarbital .",
    "our model predicts that the power in this signal should decrease as @xmath7 rises and suppression becomes more evident .",
    "a negative result in these experiments would indicate that our model is missing a fundamental element .",
    "one such element is intrinsic or synaptic noise , which can act to release neurons from suppression ( white , unpublished observations ) .",
    "the more difficult goal for our model to achieve is that of firing synchronously at ripple ( 200 hz ) frequencies , as has been reported in the behaving animal  @xcite .",
    "one or more of several conceivable explanations may underlie this apparent robustness in hippocampal function at high frequencies .",
    "first , it is possible , but unlikely , that heterogeneity in the intrinsic firing frequencies of interneurons is very low ( @xmath66% ) .",
    "second , the operant value of @xmath7 may be lower than we believe ; a value of 5 ms would conceivably allow synchrony at 200 hz with levels of heterogeneity of around 5% .",
    "third , each interneuron may fire not at 200 hz , but rather at a lower frequency of , say , 100 hz , during sharp waves . under this explanation ,",
    "the 200-hz ripple would be generated by clusters of two or more populations of neurons spiking independently .",
    "finally , some factor(s ) not considered here may enhance synchrony at high frequencies .",
    "gap junction - mediated electrical coupling among interneurons , for which some evidence exists in the hippocampal region ca1",
    "@xcite , is perhaps the most likely such factor  @xcite .",
