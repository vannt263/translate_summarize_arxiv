    "*     logarithmic conformal field theory can be interesting for two reasons at least .",
    "the first is their possible applications in condensed - matter systems : the quantum hall effect  @xcite , self - organized critical phenomena  @xcite , the two - dimensional percolation problem  @xcite , and others ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the second is the general category - theory aspects of conformal field theory involving vertex - operator algebras with nonsemisimple representation categories  @xcite ( also see  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are few well - investigated examples in logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "presently , only the @xmath6 model  @xcite is formulated with sufficient completeness .",
    "a number of results exist on the @xmath7 models  @xcite , but no model has been investigated so completely as the ising model , for example .",
    "an essential new feature of nonsemisimple ( logarithmic ) conformal field theories , in comparison with semisimple ( rational ) theories , already occurs in constructing the space of states . in the semisimple case",
    ", it suffices to take the sum of all irreducible representations in each chiral sector .",
    "but in the nonsemisimple case , there are various indecomposable representations , constructed beginning with first extensions of irreducible representations , then taking their further extensions , and so on , ending up with _ projective modules _ ( the largest possible indecomposable extensions , and hence the modules with the largest jordan cells , for the scaling dimension operator @xmath8 , that can be constructed for a given set of irreducible representations ) .",
    "the space of states is therefore given by the sum over all nonisomorphic indecomposable projective modules , @xmath9 this affects not only theory but also applications : the physically important operators ( thermal , magnetic , and so on ) in specific models may often be identified with the field corresponding to the `` highest - weight '' vector in a projective module @xmath10 , not with the primary field ( of the same dimension ) corresponding to the highest - weight vector of the irreducible quotient of  @xmath10 . also , whenever indecomposable representations are involved , there are more possibilities for constructing modular invariants by combining the chiral and antichiral spaces of states .",
    "but an even more essential point about nonsemisimple theories is that before speaking of the representations , their characters , fusion , etc . , one must find the symmetry algebra whose representations , characters , fusion , etc",
    "are to be considered ; this algebra is typically _ not _ the `` naive , '' manifest symmetry algebra .",
    "this point was expounded in  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry algebras of logarithmic conformal field theory models are typically nonlinear extensions of the naive symmetry algebra ( e.g. , virasoro ) , i.e. , are some @xmath3-algebras . the first examples of @xmath3-algebras arising in this context were studied in  @xcite , also see  @xcite and the references therein .    in a given logarithmic model",
    ", the chiral @xmath3-algebra must be big enough to ensure that only a finite number of its irreducible representations are realized in the model .",
    "only then can one expect to have finite - dimensional fusion rules and modular group representation ( we recall that a finite - dimensional modular group representation is a good test of the _ consistency _ of the model .",
    "also , once finitely many irreducible representations are involved , there are finitely many projective modules , and the sum in   makes sense .    in this paper , we systematically investigate the logarithmic extensions of the @xmath0 models of conformal field theory .",
    "this task was already set in  @xcite , in the line of an appropriate extension of the results obtained for the @xmath7 models .",
    "the method in  @xcite is to define and construct logarithmic conformal field models in terms of free fields and screenings .",
    "the chiral algebra  @xmath11 that is the symmetry algebra of the model is then derived from the kernel of the screenings in the vacuum representation of a lattice vertex - operator algebra  @xmath12 .",
    "irreducible representations of  @xmath11 are identified with the images and cohomology of ( certain powers of ) the screenings in irreducible representations of  @xmath12 .",
    "the projective @xmath11-modules in   are then to be constructed as the projective covers of the irreducible representations ( this construction may be rather involved ; a notable exception is provided by the @xmath6 model , see  @xcite ) .    in what follows , we set @xmath13 and @xmath14 , a fixed pair of coprime positive integers .    in the _ rational _ @xmath15 model ,",
    "the chiral symmetry algebra is the vertex - operator algebra  @xmath16 defined as the cohomology of screenings that act in the vacuum representation  @xmath17 of the appropriate lattice vertex - operator algebra  @xmath18 ; irreducible representations of  @xmath16 can then be identified with the cohomology of ( powers of ) the screenings in irreducible representations of  @xmath18 .    in",
    "the _ logarithmic _ @xmath15 model , ( the vacuum representation of ) the chiral algebra @xmath19 extends  @xmath16 such that @xmath20 , where  @xmath21 is the maximal vertex - operator ideal in  @xmath19 .",

    "the irreducible representations of @xmath19 are of two different kinds .",

    "the second are the @xmath28 modules that admit a nontrivial action of  @xmath21 .",
    "they can be identified with the images of ( powers of ) the screenings in the respective irreducible representations of the lattice vertex - operator algebra @xmath18 and decompose into infinitely many irreducible virasoro modules .",

    "some `` well - behaved '' cases , the occurrence of the kazhdan  lusztig - dual quantum group can be seen by taking @xmath75 , a direct sum of projective @xmath11-modules with some multiplicities  @xmath76 chosen such that they are additive with respect to the direct sum , such sums are assumed to be finite ; from a somewhat more general standpoint , this must follow from a set of fundamental requirements on  @xmath11 in a given nonsemisimple model .",
    "first , the algebra itself must be generated by a finite number of fields  @xmath77 .",
    "the category  @xmath74 of @xmath11-modules with locally nilpotent action of the positive modes of  @xmath77 is then well defined .",
