    "the linear boltzmann equation ( also referred to as the boltzmann - lorentz equation or kinetic lorentz equation ) is one of the fundamental transport equations that describe the macroscopic dynamics of a dilute gas in matter .",
    "the equation was postulated by lorentz in 1905 @xcite by considering a gas of non - interacting point particles moving in an infinite , fixed array of hard sphere scatterers .",
    "crucially , lorentz assumed that in the limit of small scatterers ( boltzmann - grad limit ) consecutive collisions become independent of each other and are solely determined by the single - scatterer cross section .",
    "lorentz heuristic derivation of the linear boltzmann equation was put on a rigorous footing in the case of a _",
    "random _ scatterer configuration in the seminal papers by gallavotti @xcite , spohn @xcite , and boldrighini , bunimovich and sinai @xcite . on the other hand , our recent studies of _ periodic _ scatterer configurations @xcite , @xcite",
    "show that in this case the boltzmann - grad limit is governed by a transport equation which is distinctly different from the linear boltzmann equation .",
    "one of the main features is here that ( contrary to lorentz assumption ) consecutive collisions are no longer independent : the collision kernel of our transport equation does not only depend on the particle velocity before and after each collision , but also on the flight time until the next collision and the velocity thereafter .",
    "the collision kernel is thus significantly more complicated than in the linear boltzmann equation , and explicit formulas are so far only known in dimension @xmath0 @xcite ; cf .  also @xcite , @xcite for different approaches .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to focus on dimension @xmath1 and derive asymptotic estimates for the collision kernel for small and large inter - collision times .",
    "these estimates yield in particular precise asymptotics for the distribution of the free path length in the periodic lorentz gas , and thus improve the upper and lower bounds obtained by bourgain , golse and wennberg @xcite , @xcite .      to explain the setting of our results in more detail ,",
    "let us fix a euclidean lattice @xmath2 , and assume ( without loss of generality ) that its fundamental cell has volume one .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the complement of the set @xmath4 ( the `` billiard domain '' ) , and @xmath5 its unit tangent bundle ( the `` phase space '' ) , with @xmath6 the position and @xmath7 the velocity of the particle at time @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 [ scrbdef ] denotes the open ball of radius @xmath10 , centered at the origin , and @xmath11 the unit sphere .",
    "the dynamics of a particle in the lorentz gas is defined as the motion with unit speed along straight lines , and specular reflection at the balls @xmath12 .",
    "we may in fact also permit other scattering processes , such as the scattering map of a muffin - tin coulomb potential ; cf .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "a dimensional argument shows that in the boltzmann - grad limit @xmath13 the free path length scales like @xmath14 , i.e. , the inverse of the total scattering cross section of an individual scatterer .",
    "it is therefore natural to rescale space and time by introducing the macroscopic coordinates ( see figure [ figlorentz ] ) @xmath15 the time evolution of a particle with initial data @xmath16 is then described by the billiard flow @xmath17 since the speed of our particle is a constant of motion we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath18 . for notational reasons it is convenient to extend the dynamics to the inside of each scatterer trivially , i.e. , set @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 is inside the scatterer .",
    "that is , the relevant phase space is now the unit tangent bundle of @xmath21 , which will be denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "let us fix a probability measure @xmath23 on @xmath22 . for random initial data @xmath24 with respect to @xmath23 , we can then view the billiard flow @xmath25 as a stochastic process .",
    "the central result of @xcite , @xcite is that , if @xmath23 is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesque measure , the billiard flow converges in the boltzmann - grad limit to a random flight process @xmath26 , which is defined as the flow with unit speed along a random piecewise linear curve , whose path segments @xmath27 are generated by a markov process with memory two .",
    "specifically , if we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , then the distribution of the first @xmath31 path segments is given by the probability density @xmath32 see theorem 1.3 and section 4 in @xcite .    before describing the transition probability densities @xmath33 and @xmath34 in more detail , let us explain the relation of our limiting stochastic process @xmath35 with the macroscopic dynamics of a particle cloud discussed earlier .",
