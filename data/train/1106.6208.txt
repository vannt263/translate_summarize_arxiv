    "supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theories ( guts ) are prompted as one of the most appealing extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . among other things",
    "they offer the opportunity to relate the flavour sector of the quarks and the leptons to each other .",
    "the most praised example for this is the fact that in many gut models the yukawa couplings of the bottom quark and the tau lepton unify at the gut scale , as it was at first obtained in @xcite . under the assumption that no new physics appears between the electroweak and the gut scale , the mass splitting observed at low energy would then be entirely owed to renormalization group running .",
    "in fact , if in a bottom - up approach the yukawa couplings are evolved under the above assumptions up to the gut scale , they do not unify , being their ratio @xmath0 roughly 1.3 for @xmath1 between 5 and 50 .",
    "yukawa unification could be recovered by finite susy threshold loop corrections @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) the susy breaking parameters would in this case have to fulfill a very peculiar pattern , for recent discussions see , e.g.  @xcite . in most of the cmssm parameter space the ratio is actually shifted to larger values .    in recent papers , one of the authors @xcite realised that there is an alternative to @xmath2 yukawa unification . if the yukawa couplings are generated effectively by a dimension five operator with an additional adjoint @xmath3 higgs representation , the @xmath0 ratio would be predicted to be @xmath4 , easily achievable within the cmssm for values of @xmath5 .    in this letter",
    "we go beyond these previous studies .",
    "first , we show the ratio @xmath0 at the gut scale in the @xmath6-@xmath7-plane for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is a useful tool for model builders , if their models predict either a certain susy breaking scheme close to the cmssm or a certain gut scale value for @xmath0 . for an illustrative discussion of the interplay between the susy spectrum and a non - standard @xmath9-@xmath10 yukawa coupling ratio , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "second , we provide not only the gut scale ratio @xmath0 , but also some up - to - date experimental constraints within these planes , to identify preferred parameter regions and values for @xmath0 .",
    "to calculate the susy spectrum we use softsusy @xcite and focus on the most important constraints on the cmssm for large @xmath1 .",
    "we collect the numerical values of the constraints as well as the most important sm input parameters in tab .  [",
    "tab : input ] .    in the flavour sector",
    "the two most prominent constraints for the large @xmath1 regime are given by the observables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , that are both @xmath1 enhanced .",
    "the calculation of these observables is performed with superiso @xcite . nevertheless , it turned out that only the former gives relevant constraints in the @xmath6-@xmath7 planes and therefore we present only this one in our final plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .    in the sm",
    ", there is an approximate 3@xmath13 tension between the experimentally determined anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and its theoretical prediction , @xmath14 @xcite . within susy models",
    "this tension can be relaxed by finite contributions , that are @xmath1 enhanced as well .",
    "we calculate these ones with the superiso package @xcite .",
    "we also show the 3@xmath13 region preferred by the experimental determination of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) relic density as provided by the wmap collaboration @xcite , which we calculate with darksusy including sommerfeld enhancement @xcite .",
    "this translates into a bound on the parameter space under the assumption that we have standard cosmology , r - parity is conserved , and dark matter is made of the lightest neutralino .",
    "furthermore , we include the lep mass limit for the chargino @xcite and the exclusion bound from the atlas susy search with one lepton , jets and missing transverse energy in the final state @xcite .",
    "the other atlas @xcite and cms results @xcite are similar or even weaker .",
    "the atlas bound is given only for a specific value of @xmath15 and @xmath1 , but as discussed , e.g.  in @xcite , it depends only weakly on these two parameters .",
    ".numerical values for the experimental input used in our scans .",
    "we only list third generation fermion masses and the value for @xmath16 , since the other sm parameters have a negligible influence on the gut scale @xmath0 .",
    "the errors for @xmath11 are added linearly .",
    "[ tab : input ] [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     for @xmath17 the situation changes .",
    "first of all , the disfavoured region , where the stau is the lightest susy particle , becomes quite large . for @xmath18",
    "there is no region in which both the tension for @xmath14 and that for @xmath11 are less than 2@xmath13 while simultaneously fulfilling the cdm bound . for the other two @xmath19 cases one clearly sees that @xmath14 prefers a rather light spectrum , while @xmath20 prefers a heavier spectrum . in combination with the cdm and higgs mass bounds in the case",
    "@xmath21 the light mass region is nevertheless disfavoured , while in the case @xmath22 @xmath20 excludes this region . for the heavier regions , despite not curing the sm tension with @xmath14 , we find a preferred @xmath23 .",
    "the collider constraints from atlas @xcite and cms @xcite are not important so far .",
    "we show here only the atlas exclusion bound coming from the susy search with one lepton , jets and missing transverse energy in the final state , but the other ones are similar or worse .",
    "we have checked that our preferred point as given in tab .",
    "[ tab : goodpoint ] is not excluded yet .",
    "this might change in the near future .",
    "the lhc has already taken more than 1  fb@xmath24 of data , while the exclusion bounds discussed here are derived from only 35  pb@xmath24 of data .",
    "therefore , in the next year most of the preferred regions discussed here will be tested .",
    "for realistic flavour models embedded into a susy gut it is essential to know the gut scale yukawa coupling ratios . in this letter we present the most prominent and generic one , the ratio @xmath0 , for different slices of the cmssm parameter space .",
    "the variation of this ratio in terms of the susy parameters is enhanced by the susy threshold corrections which are very important in the large @xmath1 regime . to determine preferred regions in these planes we also show various constraints from different experiments .",
    "the strongest one comes from the wmap measurement of the relic density .",
    "together with inputs from flavour physics ( @xmath20 ) and from measurements and calculations of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , we find a region with small tension to all observables , where @xmath0 at the gut scale is very close to 3/2 .",
    "this happens for a relatively light spectrum , with the first two generation squark and gluino masses around 1.2  tev , see tab .",
    "[ tab : goodpoint ] , which will be tested in the very near future by the lhc .",
    "we would like to thank stefan antusch and andrea romanino for useful discussions .",
