    "the superfluid transition of liquid @xmath5 offers a unique opportunity for testing the finite - size scaling theory of static and dynamic critical phenomena .",
    "recently , a sophisticated experimental study was carried out in microgravity environment , the so - called confined helium experiment ( chex ) .",
    "lipa et al.@xcite measured the specific heat of helium confined in a parallel plate geometry with a spectacular nanokelvin resolution , thus , providing experimental results within a few nanokelvin of @xmath6 .",
    "when the critical temperature is approached , the bulk correlation length @xmath7 of the fluid can become of the order of the confining length .",
    "chex approached so close to the lambda point that the correlation length became macroscopic in size . in this case the whole fluid acts in a correlated way and this changes the value of global properties , such as the specific heat , relative to their bulk values . in a parallel approach , mehta and gasparini@xcite",
    "have also reported earth - bound measurements on samples with smaller plate spacing @xmath8 .",
    "the size of @xmath8 used is these measurements is smaller so that the results are not significantly influenced by the change in @xmath6 between the top and bottom of the film because of hydrostatic pressure difference which exists due to the earth s gravitational field .    the finite - size scaling ( fss ) theory@xcite and the renormalization - group theory ( rgt)@xcite were expected to describe the behavior of the system at temperature close to @xmath6 .",
    "a testable implication of this theory is that very close to the lambda point , in a confined system with a confining length of size @xmath2 , a dimensionless quantity or the ratio of two quantities having the same dimensions , is only a function of the ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the values of a given observable @xmath10 , for various values of @xmath2 and of the reduced temperature @xmath11 , divided by its bulk value of @xmath12 should be a dimensionless scaling function @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the results of chex were in remarkable agreement with predictions which were available prior to the experiment based on scaling functions obtained from renormalization - group theory@xcite and those obtained by combining fss and the results obtained from large - scale simulations@xcite .",
    "a second equally important step toward understanding the fss theory is to study dynamical and transport properties near a critical point .",
    "a well - suited candidate problem for this study is the thermal conductivity @xmath15 of @xmath5 near @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath6 is approached from above , the thermal conductivity of the fluid diverges@xcite .",
    "the precise behavior of bulk @xmath15 as a function of @xmath16 was studied in great detail both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "there are several recent theoretical studies of dynamical critical phenomena and dynamical scaling .",
    "koch , dohm , and stauffer@xcite presented field - theoretical and numerical studies of the validity of dynamic finite - size scaling for relaxational dynamics in cubic geometry with periodic boundary conditions above and below @xmath17 .",
    "quantitative agreement between theory and monte carlo data was obtained by them .",
    "koch and dohm@xcite have provided a prediction for the dynamic finite - size scaling function for the effective diffusion constant of model @xmath18 of hohenberg and halperin@xcite .",
    "bhattacharjee@xcite derived an approximate form of the scaling function for the thermal conductivity using a decoupled - mode approximation and model @xmath19 .",
    "krech and landau@xcite calculated the transport coefficient of the out - of - plane magnetization component at the critical point , which is related to the thermal conductivity of liquid @xmath5 using monte carlo spin dynamics simulations of the @xmath20 model in three dimensions on a simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "they determined the critical exponent characterizing the thermal conductivity .",
    "accurate experimental studies have been carried out not only for dynamic bulk phenomena with improved resolution but also dynamic properties _ in confined geometries _ deeply in the critical region@xcite .",
    "rather recently , kahn and ahlers@xcite measured the thermal conductivity of liquid @xmath5 confined in a glass capillary array of thickness 3 @xmath21 with holes @xmath22 in diameter .",
    "their results show that long cylindrical samples have a transition from three - dimensional to one - dimensional behavior and there is no phase transition in the one - dimensional system .",
    "however , as measurements over a wide range of hole - diameter are required in order to test the finite - size scaling theory for transport properties , further experimental studies are planned@xcite in order to reveal dynamical exponents near the critical point and to study the finite - size scaling behavior of the thermal conductivity in such confining geometries . to avoid the limitations imposed by the earth s gravity",
    ", this experimental effort@xcite will be carried out under microgravity conditions on the low temperature microgravity facility on international space station .    in this paper",
    "we wish to study the thermal conductivity @xmath15 of confined helium and to calculate the scaling function associated with @xmath15 for a fixed geometry .",
    "since there are already experimental results@xcite for the scaling function of @xmath15 for the pore - like geometry , in this paper we will focus our attention to this geometry because we hope to compare with the experiment .",
    "we will examine the fss theory for the thermal conductivity of helium confined in a bar - like geometry i.e. , on an @xmath23 lattice with @xmath24 .",
    "this confining geometry is similar to that of kahn and ahlers@xcite because two of the dimensions of a pore used in their experimental studies are confining as is the case of the bar - like geometry .",
    "we will consider the limit in which our results are independent of the bar length @xmath8 .",
    "we will apply periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) in the @xmath8 direction because these bc approach the bulk limit faster . in the other two directions which are kept finite",
    "we will apply open boundary conditions .",
    "we will use the dynamics of planar - magnet model and monte carlo simulation to study @xmath25 .",
    "we find that @xmath26 plotted as a function of @xmath27 fall on the same curve for a wide range of values of @xmath2 and @xmath16 , using the known values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this demonstrates that finite - size is also valid for dynamical critical properties .",
    "in addition we obtain the scaling function which fits very well the experimental data of kahn and ahlers@xcite using the scale of temperature and the thermal conductivity scale as free parameters .",
    "we will first briefly describe the model and the numerical method used and show how the thermal conductivity is computed in our model . to describe the dynamics of a superfluid",
    ", we will use the planar magnet model which is classified as model @xmath30 ( or @xmath19 in the absence of an external field ) by hohenberg and halperin@xcite .",
    "matsubara and matsuda@xcite has proposed model @xmath30 to explain the properties of liquid @xmath5 .",
    "the problem of hard core bosons can be described by a lattice gas model which can be mapped to the quantum antiferromagnet in which the superfluid order parameter corresponds to @xmath31 while the density of the boson system corresponds to @xmath32 . in order to study equilibrium critical properties of a superfluid",
    "one uses the @xmath20 model@xcite because the planar magnet model and the @xmath20 model belong to the same universality class@xcite . for critical dynamics of a superfluid",
    ", however , one needs to use the full planar magnet model in which the role of the third component of the pseudospin is crucial.@xcite    in the pseudospin notation , the planar magnet model takes the following form : @xmath33 where the summation is over all nearest neighbors , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 sets the energy scale . in the usual @xmath20 model the two - component pseudo - magnetization corresponds to the superfluid order parameter . in the planar magnet model",
    ", the third component corresponds to the particle density and it is necessary in order to study the dynamics .    in our calculations , we use a bar - like geometry , i.e. a @xmath36 lattice with @xmath37 .",
    "this geometry is chosen in order to mimic the pore geometry used in experimental studies . in our calculations ,",
    "open boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath2 direction , and in the @xmath8 direction we applied periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we use a hybrid monte carlo procedure@xcite which consists of a combination of steps using the metropolis update , the cluster update@xcite , and the over - relaxation algorithm@xcite . using this hybrid algorithm",
    ", we generate approximately 3,000 - 10,000 uncorrelated configurations from the equilibrium canonical ensemble at a given temperature .",
    "each configuration is evolved using the equations of motion for the planar magnet model which are given as follows@xcite @xmath38 starting from a particular initial spin configuration , we perform numerical integration of these equations of motion . following ref.@xcite we use a recently developed decomposition method@xcite where the integration is carried out to a maximum time @xmath39 ( typically of the order of @xmath39=400 ) with a time step @xmath40=0.05 .",
    "we made sure that this way we determined the real - time history of every configuration within a sufficiently long interval of time ( 0@xmath41 ) .",
    "finally , we compute the thermal average of a time - dependent observable ( such as the thermal current - current correlation function ) by averaging over all the values of the observable obtained by evolving all the independent initial equilibrium configurations generated via the hybrid monte carlo procedure .    compared to calculating static critical properties , the computation of dynamical properties is far more cpu time intensive and demands large computational resources .",
    "the computations described here were carried out on a dedicated massively parallel cluster of 64 cpus which was designed by our group to achieve high performance to cost ratio .",
    "we computed the thermal conductivity on @xmath42 lattices , where @xmath2=6,8,10,12,14,20 and @xmath43 .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath15 of liquid @xmath5 at a given temperature @xmath44 can be calculated using the dynamic current - current correlation function@xcite : @xmath45 where the out - of - plane static susceptibility @xmath46 is needed for normalization .",
    "the @xmath47-component @xmath48 of the current density @xmath49 associated with the lattice point @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 where the notation @xmath52 denotes the nearest neighbor of the lattice site @xmath50 in the @xmath47 lattice direction .",
    "now , we would like to examine the finite - size scaling hypothesis for the thermal resistivity @xmath53 , and to compare our results with the existing experimental results@xcite .",
    "the dependence upon @xmath16 of the bulk thermal resistivity can be described by the power law @xmath54 where @xmath29 is a dynamic critical exponent .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ res1 ] , the finite - size scaling expression for the thermal resistivity @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where the function @xmath13 is universal and @xmath28=0.6705 is the critical exponent of the correlation length@xcite .",
    "in this section , we calculate the thermal resistivity , we examine its scaling behavior with respect to @xmath2 and then we compare the scaling function with the experimental results . to calculate these observables with small statistical errors",
    "even with our utilization of the most recent numerical advances and with using the 64-node dedicated cluster , it requires signinificant amount of time of high - throughput computation .     versus temperatures for bar - like lattices with sizes that correspond to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "the resistivity scale and the temperature scale are used as free parameters . ]",
    "obtained for bar - like geometry using the theoretical value of @xmath60 . ]",
    "[ fi-1 ] shows some of our results for the thermal resistivity @xmath61 as a function of temperature @xmath44 for various lattice sizes with open boundary conditions in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "our results for @xmath61 for several values of @xmath2 and @xmath44 are given in table   [ table1 ] and  [ table2 ] .",
    "we wish to make @xmath8 large enough so that finite - size effects due to @xmath8 are smaller than our statistical errors .",
    "we have found that taking @xmath62 and applying periodic boundary conditions along the direction of @xmath8 introduces insignificant finite size effects due to the finite size of @xmath8 for the temperature range studied here . since we wish to remain in the 3d critical region",
    ", it appears that keeping @xmath58 introduces small finite - size effects due to @xmath8 in this region .",
    "lowering the temperature further , when the correlation length becomes comparable to @xmath8 , the value of @xmath63 is influenced by the finite size of @xmath8 . in this region the system exits the 3d critical region and it behaves as a one - dimensional system .",
    "notice in fig .",
    "[ fi-1 ] that the thermal resistivity feels strong finite - size effects due to the bar thickness @xmath2 .",
    "the arrow shows the bulk transition temperature @xmath64 obtained from monte carlo simulation using the planar magnet model@xcite . in bulk",

    "the number in parenthesis gives the error in the last decimal places .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we wish to avoid using any adjustable parameters to obtain scaling of our results .",
    "thus , we need to examine if our results obey scaling using the known values of the critical exponents @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the value of @xmath28 is accurately known from theoretical and experimental studies of static critical properties and we shall use the value @xmath69 as determined by goldner and ahlers@xcite .",
    "there is less agreement between theory and experiment on the actual value of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath29 .",
    "ahlers@xcite used a power law fit to the data of tam and ahlers@xcite for their `` cell @xmath30 '' and he found the value @xmath70 .",
    "however , the dynamic scaling theory@xcite had predicted a divergence in @xmath15 with a critical exponent given by @xmath71 .",
    "[ fi-2 ] shows a scaling plot of the thermal resistivity scaling function @xmath72 versus the scaled reduced temperature parameter @xmath73 , where the reduced temperature is taken relative to the bulk transition temperature @xmath6 .",
    "our monte carlo data collapse onto a universal curve using the value of @xmath74 determined by ahlers@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fi-2 ] we compare our universal function @xmath13 with the experimental data obtained by kahn and ahlers@xcite represented by a solid line . in order to do this ,",
    "we used two multiplicative constants as free fitting parameters , one multiplying the scale of @xmath75 axis and another the scale of @xmath76 .",
    "the agreement between monte carlo simulation and experiment is quite satisfactory . in the past",
    "it has been demonstrated@xcite that the boundary conditions play a significant role in defining the universal function @xmath13 .",
    "we believe that if we use more realistic boundary conditions , such as dirichlet boundary conditions , along the @xmath2-direction we can reduce the number of fitting parameters to only one .    using the theoretical value of @xmath29 , the results of our simulation also collapse on a different scaling function given in fig .",
    "[ fi-2b ] . however , if we attempt to fit the scaling curve with the experimental resistivity of kahn and ahlers we obtained a lower quality fit than that of fig .",

    "we have been able to demonstrate the validity of finite - size scaling theory and we obtained the thermal resistivity scaling function @xmath13 using known values for the critical exponents and no adjustable parameters .",
    "in addition , the scaling function @xmath13 for @xmath55 agrees rather well with experimental data using the temperature scale and thermal resistivity scale as free parameters .",
