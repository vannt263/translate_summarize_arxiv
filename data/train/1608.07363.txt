    "phase transition in a physical system corresponds to a change from one phase ( behaviour ) of the physical system to another through changes in the environment of the system .",
    "for instance the liquid - vapour transition of water when it is boiled . in the words of j. willard gibbs a phase transition is a singularity in thermodynamic behavior , i.e. singularity in the free energy of the system @xcite .",
    "the nature of the singularity , according to p. ehrenfest , determines the order of the phase transition .",
    "for instance , first order phase transition is associated with a discontinous jump in some thermodynamic quantity called the order parameter of the system .",
    "an important theory that has offered a lot of insight into the study of phase transitions is the mean field theory .",
    "this theory says that each component of the physical systems feels the average influence of all the other components of the system .",
    "johannes diderik van der waals was the first to derive mean field theory in the 1870s in his attempt at understanding the 1869 experimental data of t. andrews @xcite that showed a phase transition curve separating the liquid - vapour phases of fluids . in 1895 , pierre curie observed that a ferromagnet admits a behaviour similar to that of fluids @xcite . a mean field theory for ferromagnet was derived in 1907 by pierre weiss @xcite . in the late 1960s",
    "mark kac developed a model for ferromagnets where every magnetic moment interacts with every other magnetic moment and this model is known in the literature as the curie - weiss ( cw ) model @xcite .",
    "the curie - weiss model after its intoduction has found other applications apart from what it was originally designed to do .",
    "notable among these applications are formation of opinion in societies @xcite , immigrants integration @xcite , democratization @xcite , etc .",
    "the present paper studies phase transition in curie - weiss model conditional on having certain minimum proportions of magnetic moments following each of the two possible spin alignments",
    ". this could serve as a model for opinion formation in a society segregated along two opinions . here",
    "the minimum proportions are proportions of individuals who have fixed their orientation on one of the two opinions and they will never change their views . phase transition here will imply emergence of consensus and lack of it will imply wild flactuation of group opinion and never settling on a specific collective opinion or decision , i.e. non - consensus emergence @xcite .    in a followup paper , we will study the case where the minimum proportions are fixed according to some distribution and we ask for the effect of the disorder in these proportions on the phase transtions in the associated quenched and annealed models .",
    "this will provide a natural example of random field ising type of model @xcite with non centered random field .",
    "the present paper is the first step towards investigating these class of random field ising models .",
    "further , such models will naturally set the stage for studying spin models on site percolation clusters generated from a random process of assigning three different colours to the vertices of the underlying graph .",
    "the spins on one of the three clusters , generated from the three colours , will be fixed to + 1 , one of the remaining two will also be set to -1 and the spins on the remaining cluster could pick any of the spin values .",
    "we then ask the question of phase transition in ising spin model on such a decorated graph .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s1.1 ]",
    "we recall the curie - weiss model and collect some fact about it .",
    "section [ s1.2 ] is devoted to defining our conditional curie - weiss model .",
    "the main results of the paper are collected in section [ s1.3 ] .",
    "the results in section [ s1.3 ] are discussed in section [ s2 ] and the proofs of the main results are found in section [ s3 ] .",
    "let @xmath6 be a positive integer , @xmath7 and @xmath8 be the vertex set and the edge set respectively for a complete graph with @xmath6 vertices .",
    "denote by @xmath9 , the set of configurations of the system indexed by the elements of @xmath10 .",
    "the curie - weiss model is a probability measure @xmath11 on @xmath12 given by @xmath13 where for any @xmath14 @xmath15-\\frac12\\cr & = -n\\left[\\frac{1}{2 } m_n^2+hm_n\\right]-\\frac12 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is a real number and @xmath16 is a positive real number .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is a normalization term called the partition function of the model . @xmath1 and @xmath16 are the parameters of the model called the interaction bais and interaction strength respectively .",
    "@xmath1 is usually called an external field and @xmath16 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the function @xmath18 on configurations set @xmath12 is called the hamiltonian/ energy function of the model .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian turns to align pairs of spins , while the second turns to align spins in the direction of the external field @xmath1 .",
    "it is known in the literature that the curie - weiss models undergoes a phase transition , namely the specific magnetization @xmath19 exhibits a discontinuity as @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , it is proved in theorem iv.4.1 ( b ) of @xcite that :    [ mainfact ] for @xmath0 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the specific magnetization @xmath25 is equal to @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the minimizer of the function @xmath27 in particular , @xmath28    thus when @xmath21 , any small change in @xmath1 , no matter how small it is , that we make around @xmath24 will lead to a dramatic change in the behaviour of the system .      for any positive integer @xmath6 , let @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 be positive real numbers such that @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 further , let @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 be such that there is a partition @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 of @xmath10 such that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "define a subset @xmath45 of @xmath12 consisting of configurations @xmath46 such that @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "thus all sites labelled by @xmath38 have fixed spin value of @xmath49 , those on @xmath37 are fixed to the spin value of @xmath50 and those labelled by @xmath39 are free to choose any of the two spin values . here",
    "@xmath49 corresponds to _ opinion one _ and @xmath50 to _",
    "opinion two_. thus the part of the population indexed by @xmath51 are those who have decided on opinion one and those with label set @xmath37 are those who have chosen opinion two with those in @xmath39 yet to decide . in this paper",

    "1 .   as we will see in section [ proof - of - mt ]",
    ", the conditional curie - weiss model @xmath52 is a curie - weiss model on the sites in @xmath39 with @xmath6-dependent coupling strength @xmath91 and @xmath6-dependent external field @xmath92 .",
    "theorem [ maintheorem ] says that , up to a constant term @xmath83 and a scaling factor @xmath4 , the large @xmath6-limit of the magnetization under @xmath52 is determined by the magnetization of a curie - weiss model with coupling strength @xmath4 and external field @xmath93 .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath4 is the effective size of the set of sites in @xmath39 .",
    "notice that if @xmath70=0 , then we get the original curie - weiss model with unit coupling strength and external field @xmath1 .",

    "the conditional magnetization is then equal to the magnetization of the curie - weiss model with external field @xmath1 and coupling strength scaled by the effective size @xmath95 of the conditional model .",
    "corollary [ cor1 ] says that in the regime where @xmath94 , the singularity in the magnetization as @xmath1 goes to zero and at @xmath16-values above @xmath96 is similar to that of the original model only that in the conditional model the jump in the magnetization is suppressed by a factor of @xmath95 .",
    "3 .   in the regime",
    "where either @xmath75 or @xmath76 , with @xmath59 , it is clear that the conditional model will always be negatively or positively magnetized depending on the sign of @xmath83 .",

    "corollary [ cor3 ] says the following : 1 .   for @xmath103 ,",
    "the discontinuity in the conditional magnetization is analogous to the case in corollary [ cor2 ] .",
    "the conditional model is magnetized along the sign of @xmath83 , with jump discontinuity at @xmath62 .",
    "we have a discontinous jump in an order parameter that is not accompanied by change in phase ( see figure [ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "2 .   in the case",
    "@xmath104 , there is also discontinuous jump in the magnetization .",
    "here there is a nonzero magnetization as @xmath1 approaches @xmath97 from the values of @xmath1 for which @xmath93 has the same sign as @xmath83 . on the other hand",
    ", there is no net magnetization as @xmath1 goes to @xmath97 from @xmath1-values for which @xmath83 and @xmath93 have different signs .",
    "thus the discontinuity here leads to a change from an ordered phase , with a net magnetization , to a disordered phase , with no magnetization or vice versa ( see figure [ fig4](b ) ) .",
