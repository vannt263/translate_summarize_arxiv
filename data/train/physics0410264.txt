    "the gamma irradiation facility , gif , located downstream of the final dump of the x5 beam , uses a @xmath1cs source of 20 @xmath2 to produce a large flux of 660 @xmath3 @xmath4 rays .",
    "a system of lead filters allow to reduce the flux up to a factor of @xmath5 .",
    "the x5 muon beam can also be sent into the area .",
    "a more detailed description of this facility and of the characteristics of the @xmath4 flux can be found in @xcite .",
    "three production atlas rpc chambers ( bml - d ) are installed in the area , along the beam line .",
    "the chambers have 2 detector layers which are read out by strips oriented in both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions the chambers are perpendicular to the beam line , with the long side ( about 4 m ) oriented in the vertical direction . for details on the chamber structure , see @xcite .",
    "the chambers are operated with the atlas gas mixture @xmath8 .",
    "[ trigger ]    the trigger is provided by the coincidence of three scintillator layers of 33x40 @xmath9 , each made of three slabs . during the beam runs ,",
    "the three layers are aligned along the beam line , while for the cosmic rays runs , they are arranged as a telescope with the axis oriented at 40 degrees with respect to the vertical direction , in order to maximize the trigger rate .",
    "signals from the frontend electronics are sent to a standard atlas `` splitter board '' @xcite as in the final architecture foreseen for the trigger and readout electronics , and subsequently to tdcs working in common stop mode ( see @xcite ) which record up to 16 hits per event per channel , in a 2@xmath10 gate .",
    "both the leading and falling edges of the signals are recorded .",
    "the data acquisition is performed using a labviewapplication .",
    "the dcs system , also implemented using labview , records both the low and and high voltages as well as the gap currents .",
    "gas composition , together with all relevant environmental data such as pressure , temperature and relative humidity are controlled as well .",
    "the gas relative humidity , also monitored by the dcs , is set in the range of 30%-50% by bubbling in water a fraction of the total gas flux .",
    "the integrated ageing from the beginning of irradiation ( november 2002 ) up to july 2003 , is equivalent to 4.1 atlas years . the ageing is evaluated assuming a total charge per count of 30@xmath11 and a counting rate 5 to 10 times larger than expected from the background simulations in the atlas cavern .",
    "two main ageing parameters were measured during the test : the electrode plate resistivity , which was shown in a previous test ( @xcite ) to gradually increase with the integrated detector current , and the noise current , which is an indicator of possible degradations of the electrode surface .",
    "all along the test , the chamber efficiencies are monitored using cosmic rays . the value of the detector plate resistivity are also periodically measured , as discussed below .",
    "gap currents are measured on a daily basis , both with fully open source and closed source . a typical plot of the current versus operating voltage is shown in figure [ fig : correnti].after 3.5 atlas years ( about 100 mc/@xmath0 integrated charge ) accurate efficiency measurements",
    "have been performed using the x5 muon beam .",
    "the plate resistivity is a crucial parameter for rpc performance because it determines the detector rate capability .",
    "two different methods were followed for the resitivity measurements :        _ hv drop correction . _",
    "this method is based on the comparison of the efficiency plateaus with and without source irradiation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : eff ] , the current driven under irradiation is much higher than the one just due to the muon beam or cosmic rays .",
    "this curent produces a significant voltage drop across the plates and the voltage applied to the gas can be written ( see @xcite ) as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the effective voltage on the gas gap , v is the power supply voltage and i is the current driven by the gap .",
    "this drop causes the efficiency plateaus under irradiation to be shifted at higher hv values , as shown in figure [ fig : eff ] .",
    "this shift , allows to evaluate the plate resistivity when the gap current is also measured .    _",
    "i - v characterstic in pure argon . _",
    "the standard atlas gas mixture is replaced by pure ar .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : argon ] , the i - v curve is characterized in this case by a transition region around v=2@xmath14 with a fast current increase . for higher",
    "voltages a linear current increase is observed .",
    "we assume that above the transition voltage , the drop across the argon remains constant , so that the slope @xmath15 in the linear region gives the plates total resistance .    during the test",
    ", the chamber efficiencies are monitored using cosmic rays triggered by the scintillators .",
    "high statistics efficiency measurements are made when the x5 muon beam is available .",
    "for each event , the muon trajectory is reconstructed .",
    "the scintillator slabs of the trigger system , of size 11x40@xmath9 , would only allow a very modest tracking , not sufficient to eliminate all accidental hits at very high counting rate induced by the source .",
    "the tracking capability is therefore improved using the hits recorded by the rpcs , as decribed below:(1 ) hits recorded by the rpc under test are ignored in the tracking.(2 ) only hits registered in a time window of 25ns around the beam peack are considered useful for the track reconstruction.(3 ) a track is considered reliable only if it is built upon at least three read out layers ( out of five ) with only one cluster .",
    "( 4 ) a reliable tracking in both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions is required .",
    "( 5 ) the layer is considered efficient if it shows a cluster aligned to the track within @xmath16 1 strip .",
    "high statistics measurements were made with the x5 beam .",
    "data sets were taken with different front end electronic thresholds , source intensities , and operating voltages .",
    "the plateaus shown in figure [ fig : eff ] , for example , refer to the gap number 1 , which is the nearest to the source ( at about 2.5@xmath17 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rate ] shows , for the same gap , the counting rate as a function of the hv for different irradiation intensities .",
    "at the beginning of july 2003 the gas closed loop was introduced on 4 out of the 6 tested gas gaps , in order to simulate the real working conditions in atlas .",
    "the two remaining gaps were left in open flow for comparison .",
    "the output gas of the chambers goes through a system of filters and then is sent again in the gaps , together with a fraction of fresh gas .",
    "the total gas flow is set at , and the fraction of recirculated gas has been gradually increased as reported in table 1.the gas at the input and at the output of the chambers was sampled and analyzed in order to find any polluting component related to the chamber operation .",
    "the analisys of the recirculated gas did nt show any excess of pollutant with respect to open flow operation .",
    "[ tab : gas ]    .fraction of recirculated gas with respect to total flux [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]",
    "the measurements performed at x5-gif on three atlas production rpcs have shown an increase of the electrode plate resistivity , as expected from previous tests ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rate capability of all tested chambers remains , however , much above the atlas requirements .",
    "indeed , all the gaps under test showed a very good detection efficiency even at fully opened source , with a counting rate of about 700@xmath18 .",
    "an increase of the source - off currents was observed during the summer .",
    "this effect , due to the extreme conditions of the test ( about 40 times the nominal atlas rate ) , has been shown to be amplified by low gas flow and operating temperature above 30@xmath19 .",
    "this effect was shown to be to some extent reversible , when the gas flow and temperature conditions are set again to acceptable values and the ageing rate is reduced .",
    "ohmic currents did nt show any significant increase all along the ageing test , except the variations due to temperature excursion .    9 s. agosteo et al .",
