    "wasp-12 , a late f - type main sequence star younger than 2.65gyr @xcite , hosts one of the hottest , most bloated known exoplanets , orbiting extremely close to the host star @xcite .",
    "wasp-12b is one of the most irradiated transiting planets known , and provides key tests of the `` blow - off '' hypothesis whereby a significant fraction of the planet s atmosphere is being eroded and escapes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analysed hubble space telescope ( hst ) near - uv ( nuv ) spectra obtained with the cosmic origin spectrograph ( cos ) , confirming the on - going blow - off , similar to that of hd209458 @xcite .",
    "nuv dips during the planetary crossings are up to three times deeper than the optical transits of wasp-12b , suggesting there is diffuse gas extending well beyond the planetary roche lobe .",
    "@xcite suggested that the gas lost by the planet could form an accretion disk around the star .",
    "the hst data revealed a variable and early ingress , contrary to model expectations , but with egresses compatible with the optical ephemeris .",
    "the early - ingress phenomenon has been modeled by various authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these models do not yet explain the presence of an ingress as early as orbital phase @xmath10.17 @xcite .",
    "the hst data further disclosed a remarkable anomaly in the stellar nuv spectrum : the apparent absence of the normally bright emission cores in the h&k resonance lines @xcite .",
    "significantly , the anomaly is always present , regardless of the planet s orbital phase .",
    "the absence of core emission was completely unexpected given the spectral type and imputed age of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure16 of @xcite compares the near - uv spectra of wasp-12 , hd102634 , hd107213 and procyon ; procyon is a mid - f subgiant commonly used as an inactive comparison star , while hd102634 and hd107213 are similar in temperature and age @xcite to wasp-12 .",
    "the comparison highlights the complete lack of emission in the wasp-12 line cores .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discussed scenarios that could lead to the anomalous line cores : ( 1 ) intrinsically low stellar activity ; or ( 2 ) extrinsic absorption , either from the interstellar medium ( ism ) or from material within the system , for example in a circumstellar disk .",
    "@xcite showed that the ism column density required to reproduce the apparent absorption was 10 times greater than expected along the wasp-12 line of sight , but that planetary mass loss potentially could produce the large column required to extinct the cores .",
    "opportunities to use the h&k lines to compare wasp-12 with other stars are few : inactive distant stars have rarely been observed at high resolution in the nuv , because of the bias of interest in nuv - bright stars , which either are active or nearby . the optical h&k resonance lines also display core emission of chromospheric origin closely related to that of the lines , although not as strong @xcite .",
    "the lines have been used to assess the activity of extensive samples of late - type stars , including planet - hosts , some of which indeed are inactive and distant @xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ ca ] we compare wasp-12 s h&k line profiles with those of other inactive and distant planet - hosting stars ; in sect .  [ ism ] we evaluate the ism absorption along the wasp-12 line of sight ; and in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] we discuss possible origins of the anomalously depressed resonance line cores .",
    "it is well known that chromospheric activity correlates with the stellar rotational velocity . for wasp-12",
    "the rotation rate is unknown , but the projected rotational velocity ( ) has an upper limit of only 1   ( e. simpson , private communication ) . because a low  could potentially imply an intrinsically low level of stellar activity , we must consider whether depressed chromospheric emission might be responsible for the core anomaly . ideally , we would compare with stars of similar type which do not host hot - jupiters .",
    "however , planet - hosts are far better studied at high spectral resolution in the visible , so we exploited planet - host spectra obtained for planet detection through doppler - reflex or stellar characterisation .",
    "figure  [ fig : corot1wasp1 ] compares the wasp-12 h&k lines with those of hat - p-7 and wasp-1 .",
    "the spectra were acquired with the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) on the kecki telescope .",
    "we obtained the reduced data from the hires archive , and focused on spectra with the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and taken with the same instrument settings as the out - of - transit phases of wasp-12 .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the three stars are listed in table  [ tab : comp ] . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the comparison stars are comparable in effective temperature ( ) to wasp-12 .",
    "reliable ages are not available for hat - p-7 and wasp-1 , but their low should be considered upper limits as @xcite ignored possible contributions from `` macroturbulence '' . ] and  values indicate they certainly are not young .",
    "distances were estimated based on the @xmath2-band magnitudes , , and radii ; reddenings e(@xmath3 ) then were derived from the extinction maps of @xcite .",

    "flux normalisation was performed in two steps .",
    "we removed the blaze function adjusting the continuum using a synthetic spectrum with atmospheric parameters appropriate to the three stars .",
    "we then matched the fluxes of the far line wings to wasp-12 , for the h and k lines separately , using the windows indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : corot1wasp1 ] .",
    "the latter adjustments were all @xmath85% .",
    "as anticipated from the earlier h&k line observations @xcite , the h&k line cores of wasp-12 are significantly deeper than those of hat - p-7 and wasp-1 , despite similarities in the stellar properties .",
    "the anomaly covers a @xmath54  wide region , similar to the h&k depression .",
    "the same comparison relative to corot-1 , hat - p-8 , hat - p-16 , hat - p-24 , hat - p-33 , hat - p-39 , kepler-8 , kepler-25 , tres-4 , and wasp-3 , always shows the central @xmath54  of the line core the most depressed in wasp-12 .",
    "the flux adjustment might seem to be challenging in this heavily blanketed spectral region , but there are enough relatively clean intervals in the wings that our results are very little affected by the normalization procedure .",
    "we carefully checked that background light under-/over - correction could not explain the observed anomaly in the wasp-12 line core .",
    "@xcite measured the  activity index in 50 transiting planet host stars , finding that wasp-12 was the least active , by that measure , with a remarkably low = @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig : logr ] shows that wasp-12 is an extreme outlier in a color ( @xmath3 ) vs. activity ( ) plane populated by the samples from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . as the  index is logarithmic , wasp-12 indeed falls well below the lower boundary of the envelope of activity displayed by the stars considered here . for solar",
    "metallicity dwarfs the lower bound is at @xmath10 @xcite and it decreases slightly to @xmath11 for stars with the somewhat enhanced metallicity of wasp-12 @xcite .",
    "the lower bound of the index results from a `` basal '' level of chromospheric emission which seems to depend mainly on  and only weakly on metallicity ( as noted above ) .",
    "stars with indices above the basal level are affected by varying degrees of dynamo magnetic activity , which does correlate with the rotational velocity .",
    "the basal flux level should be a hard lower bound on the chromospheric emission of a late - type main sequence star , and any otherwise normal dwarf that falls below the basal level must be affected by extrinsic absorption which attenuates the intrinsic core emission . to be sure , evolved subgiants can fall below the basal boundary , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : logr ] contains contamination by such subgiants , but they can be discriminated by the broadening of their emission cores by the `` wilson - bappu effect '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in short , as suggested in @xcite , it is likely that the abnormally low  index of wasp-12 derived by @xcite is simply biased by extrinsic absorption , hiding the chromospheric signatures that must be present intrinsically in h&k .",
    "wasp-12 ( blue triangle ) in @xmath3 vs.  plane , compared with stars with @xmath12 observed by @xcite ( squares ) , @xcite ( stars ) , and @xcite ( red pluses ) .",

    "the dotted line indicates the minimum activity value within the @xcite sample , accounting for contamination by subgiants @xcite.,width=642 ]",
    "to determine the contribution of interstellar absorption to the depressions in the cores of both and , we carried out a study of the ism column in the wasp-12 sightline .",
    "we used  @xcite at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and fies at the nordic optical telescope ( not ) to obtain high resolution spectra of three early - type stars ( hd257926 , hd258049 , hd258439 ) lying within 20@xmath0 of wasp-12 , and at about the same distance .",
    "we observed hot stars for three reasons : 1 ) they are brighter than wasp-12 at the same distance , allowing high - s / n measurements ; 2 ) they are typically fast rotators , simplifying identification of the sharp ism absorptions ; and 3 ) they do not exhibit stellar activity , which might otherwise affect interpretations of the h&k lines .    the  spectra cover 370010400 , with a resolving power of 80000 in the `` star only '' instrumental configuration , while the fies spectra cover 37007400 , with a resolving power of 67000",
    "the spectra revealed that hd258049 is a spectroscopic binary , while hd258439 is a chemically peculiar star ( possibly magnetic ) , and therefore less straightforward to model .",
    "for this reason we focused on hd257926 , apparently a chemically normal early a - type star .",
    "it lies 15.7@xmath0 away from wasp-12 on the sky , at about twice the distance ( @xmath5650pc ) .",
    "we estimated the fundamental parameters by comparing observed hydrogen line profiles ( h@xmath13 , h@xmath14 , h@xmath15 , and h@xmath16 ) with synthetic spectra calculated with the  code @xcite , utilizing  model atmospheres @xcite .",

    "we calculated synthetic ism line profiles for a range of `` @xmath17 '' parameters ( characterizing thermal and turbulent line broadening ) and column densities , and for each @xmath17 value determined the column density that reproduced the observed equivalent width . for , we then compared the derived h and k column densities , and determined the @xmath17 value for which the two column densities agreed .",

    "we then applied a monte carlo scheme to estimate the parameter uncertainties in the gaussian fitting .    in estimating the final and column densities , we considered the effect of the equivalent width uncertainties and the influence of the @xmath17 parameter , which was varied in the 2.84.0  range , compatible with the spread of values observed in the direction of wasp-12 @xcite .",

    "we estimated the corresponding column density assuming the solar abundance , obtaining logn=16.42 in agreement with the value proposed by @xcite , but far below the logn=17.30 required to reproduce the full line core depressions @xcite .",
    "in sections  [ ca ] and [ ism ] we showed that neither lack of activity nor strong ism absorption is likely to be responsible for the anomalously deep resonance line cores in wasp-12 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the anomaly might be caused by extrinsic absorption by diffuse material within the wasp-12 planetary system .",
    "@xcite searched for the infrared signature of a cool component to wasp-12 s sed , but found none .",
    "it is well established that wasp-12b is experiencing a blow - off phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the planetary atmosphere would be an obvious reservoir of gas to fill a circumstellar disk / cloud . given the variability of chromospheric activity and that the planet s orbit is only one stellar diameter away from the surface of wasp-12 , there are many processes stripping gas from the planet , and subsequently acting upon it , making the geometry complex and time variable .",
    "the broadband nuv transits reported by @xcite directly revealed dramatic variability in the diffuse gas distribution .",
    "@xcite suggested that gas lost by the planet would fall toward the star , forming an accretion disk interior to the planet . in contrast , @xcite interpret the observations in terms of bow - shocked material entrained in the planet s magnetosphere .",
    "it is certain that the stellar wind and the stellar radiation pressure , along with the dynamic magnetic fields of both planet and star , play important roles in determining the time - dependent behaviour of the gas . the diffuse gas , which shares the planet s specific angular momentum ,",
    "but has a greatly enhanced specific cross - section to radiation , is likely to move outwards from the planet s orbit as suggested in @xcite . in that scenario",
    ", it is easy to imagine that the gas will not be tightly constrained to the orbital plane , but will disperse to cover much of the disk of the star from our near - edge - on viewing angle . in the accretion disk scenario of @xcite it is less obvious that the diffuse gas will shadow the widespread bright chromospheric `` network '' on the stellar disk , but the simulation by @xcite , suggests that the planet could expel gas to distances as large as five planet radii perpendicular to the planet s orbit ( about half the stellar diameter , if the ejection is symmetrical about the orbital plane ) .",
    "the relatively high temperature of the disk should prevent it settling onto the orbital plane .",
    "but , if this indeed were to occur , the large mass of the material comprising the disk would force the settling time scale to be longer than the orbital period , therefore the planet could continually pump up the disk thickness by feeding new material into it .",
    "we have argued that the flux depression anomaly we detected in the cores of the and resonance lines of wasp-12 is evidence for the presence of a translucent circumstellar disk / cloud of material lost by the evaporating exoplanet .",
    "figure  [ fig : logr ] ( bottom - left corner and insert ) highlights five other stars , also hosting hot - jupiters , that have anomalously low stellar activity indices : x0 - 4 , corot-1 , wasp-13 , wasp-17 , and wasp-18 .",
    "the latter is particularly noteworthy given the many similarities with the wasp-12 system .",
    "the only significant differences are the planet mass ( wasp-18b is @xmath57 times more massive than wasp-12b ) and the stellar age ( wasp-18 is only @xmath50.6gyr old ; * ? ? ?",
    "the heavier companion and larger stellar activity would undoubtedly have an impact on the geometry and stability of a planet - fed disk / cloud .",
    "a practical advantage is that wasp-18 is 2.3 magnitudes brighter than wasp-12 , allowing more precise measurements of the planetary exospheric radius , as well as the prospect of acquiring far - uv spectra ( which would conclusively settle the `` activity '' issue ) .",
    "our findings and these considerations make the wasp-18 planetary system a key target for future uv observations to continue to build the legacy of hst studies of evaporating hot - jupiters .",

    "<S> near - uv observations of the planet host star wasp-12 uncovered the apparent absence of the normally conspicuous core emission of the h&k resonance lines . </S>",
    "<S> this anomaly could be due either to ( 1 ) a lack of stellar activity , which would be unprecedented for a solar - like star of the imputed age of wasp-12 ; or ( 2 ) extrinsic absorption , from the intervening interstellar medium ( ism ) or from material within the wasp-12 system itself , presumably ablated from the extreme hot jupiter wasp-12b . </S>",
    "<S> hires archival spectra of the h&k lines of wasp-12 show broad depressions in the line cores , deeper than those of other inactive and similarly distant stars and similar to wasp-12 s h&k line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we took high resolution  and fies spectra of three early - type stars within 20@xmath0 of wasp-12 and at similar distances , which show the ism column is insufficient to produce the broad depression observed in wasp-12 . </S>",
    "<S> the ebhis column density map supports and strengthens this conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> extrinsic absorption by material local to the wasp-12 system is therefore the most likely cause of the line core anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> gas escaping from the heavily irradiated planet could form a stable and thick circumstellar disk / cloud . the anomalously low stellar activity index ( ) of wasp-12 </S>",
    "<S> is evidently a direct consequence of the extra core absorption , so similar hk index deficiencies might signal the presence of translucent circumstellar gas around other stars hosting evaporating planets . </S>"
