    "quantum mechanics exhibits an odd dichotomy in the time evolution of states .",
    "a quantum state undergoes deterministic , unitary evolution until a measurement causes probabilistic , non - unitary collapse .",
    "while many physicists do not feel that there is anything wrong with this standard copenhagen picture , it seems less than economical to postulate two fundamental processes  unitary evolution and non - unitary measurement  if somehow one could suffice .",
    "everett @xcite proposed that unitary time evolution of a closed system is sufficient to account for the _ appearance _ of measurement collapse to observers inside the system ( see also hartle @xcite and dewitt and graham @xcite ) , in what has now become known as the many worlds ( mw ) formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the mw interpretation is regarded as extravagant , and hence implausible , by many ( including at least one of the authors ) , because of the huge multiplicity of branches of the wavefunction , each of which is presumed to be as real as the others @xcite . before the anti - mw reader abandons this paper",
    ", we note that the discussion that follows applies also to the conventional copenhagen interpretation , with measurement collapse , and may allow a derivation of probability in quantum mechanics from a weaker initial assumption , known as the certainty assumption , along the lines of hartle @xcite ( see also farhi , goldstone and gutmann @xcite and coleman and lesniewski @xcite ) . an attractive doctrine ( preferred by one of the authors )",
    "is the minimalist view outlined by hartle @xcite insisting that physics should be done without ill - defined words and slogans such as  the other worlds are just as real . \"",
    "our analysis could also be read within this post - everett or decoherent histories approach .",
    "we focus on the born rule in quantum mechanics , and the extent to which it can be derived .",
    "the born rule states that given an observable @xmath0 with spectrum @xmath1 and eigenstates @xmath2 , the probability of @xmath1 as the outcome of a measurement on state @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "_ it has been claimed by everett , hartle , and others , that this rule arises as a consequence of the assumption of unitary evolution , but as we discuss below , the derivation is unsatisfactory for any system with only a finite number of degrees of freedom . _",
    "( for recent discussions of the born rule in mw , see @xcite . )    in a recent paper @xcite we speculated that quantum gravity and related considerations may imply that quantum state space is itself discrete .",
    "we will review our argument in the next section . here",
    "we point out that one consequence of this discreteness in state space may be the emergence of the born rule , even in the case when the number of degrees of freedom is finite .",
    "the original derivation of the born rule given by everett @xcite , hartle @xcite , and others , is quite simple .",
    "consider an ensemble of identically prepared states @xmath5 and a sequence of outcomes @xmath6 obtained from measurements on each of the states .",
    "the probability @xmath7 of a given sequence , or class of sequences , calculated using the born rule , is identical to the norm ( magnitude ) squared of the projection of @xmath8 onto eigenstates with the eigenvalues @xmath9 , namely @xmath10 .",
    "as everett noted , it follows that an improbable sequence corresponds to a component of @xmath8 ( in the eigenstate basis ) with small magnitude . in the formal limit @xmath11 , components of @xmath8 which do not correspond to statistically typical sequences generated by the born rule have zero magnitude ( i.e. converge to the null vector ) , and therefore do not correspond to physical states . from the frequentist perspective on probability ,",
    "then , the born rule is a consequence of excluding zero norm states from the hilbert space .    to further elucidate ,",
    "consider a simple example using spin states .",
    "let @xmath12 , and define @xmath13",
    ". then a sequence of measurement outcomes will be of the form @xmath14 .",
    "if the sequence is generated by the born rule , then in the limit of large @xmath15 , the fraction of @xmath16 outcomes will be @xmath17 to very good approximation .",
    "any other value for the fraction of @xmath16 outcomes has zero probability at infinite @xmath15 . correspondingly , the magnitude squared @xmath18 is zero for any state @xmath19 in which the fraction of outcomes @xmath20 equal to @xmath16 is not @xmath17",
    ".    this can be generalized : if @xmath19 corresponds to a sequence @xmath21 which is statistically atypical according to the born rule , its overlap with @xmath8 will vanish when @xmath11 .",
    "everett referred to these branches of the wavefunction as `` maverick worlds''observers on these branches would not deduce the born rule .",
    "below , we will repeat this discussion for those readers who prefer a more standard copenhagen interpretation to the mw interpretation",
    ".    we can define parameters characterizing the deviation of a maverick world from the central born value .",
    "for example , in the spin example , we might consider @xmath22 to be the frequency of @xmath16 outcomes , so that @xmath23 is the deviation parameter .",
    "then any branch with non - zero @xmath24 will have vanishing norm in the large @xmath15 limit .",
    "when @xmath15 is strictly infinite all maverick worlds have zero norm .",
    "the remaining branches have outcomes @xmath25 which satisfy the born rule in the frequentist sense .",
    "the problem with this reasoning is of course that @xmath15 is never strictly infinite .",
    "in fact , given the finite size of the causal horizon of our universe and an ultraviolet cutoff on modes ( e.g. , from the planck scale ) , we obtain a finite , although very large , upper limit on the number of outcomes @xmath15 which characterize any particular branch of the mw wavefunction . without invoking something like the born rule  a correspondence between probability and norm ",
    "there is no reason to exclude branches with small but non - zero norm .",
    "the problem is exacerbated by the fact that maverick worlds are generally far more numerous than non - maverick worlds .",
    "the mw wavefunction branches with each measurement , regardless of how small either of @xmath26 is .",
    "this leads to @xmath27 total branches after @xmath15 measurements .",
    "even if , e.g. , @xmath28 is much larger than @xmath29 , both @xmath16 and @xmath30 outcomes will still occur at each branch , and the structure of the tree is independent of @xmath31 as long as neither is zero .",
    "the overwhelming majority of branches will have roughly equal numbers of @xmath16 and @xmath30 outcomes .",
    "thus the multiplicity of maverick worlds is enormously larger than non - maverick worlds , although their collective magnitude is vanishingly small . again , without assuming the born rule , we have no _  priori _ reason to exclude small ( but non - zero ) norm states .",
    "of course , a strict frequentist interpretation of probability requires an infinite sequence of outcomes .",
    "however , the use of probability by physicists is more bayesian than frequentist : confronted with a _",
    "finite _ sequence of outcomes , @xmath6 , our goal is to deduce a predictive model for subsequent outcomes . in this way , we deduce the born rule based on the limited number of measurements",
    "thus far performed on quantum systems .    as mentioned",
    ", our discussion may be of interest even to those who do not accept mw , as it pertains to the origin of the born rule within the copenhagen , or measurement collapse , interpretation .",
    "in particular , it has been proposed by hartle @xcite that the born rule can be derived from the weaker _ certainty assumption _ , stating that when a measurement of an observable @xmath0 is performed on an eigenstate @xmath32 of @xmath0 , the value @xmath33 is obtained with certainty .",
    "taking @xmath0 to be , for example , the frequency operator for @xmath16 outcomes , or any other statistical property , hartle found that for @xmath15 infinite , @xmath8 is an eigenstate of each of these statistical operators , with eigenvalues given by the born rule .",
    "the discussion parallels that in the mw interpretation . in the standard copenhagen picture",
    "the state @xmath8 is , in the eigenstate basis , a sum of @xmath27 terms , each term being in one - to - one correspondence with a mw branch or a universe . in the copenhagen interpretation",
    "the outcomes @xmath25 result from measurements on an ensemble , whereas in mw they specify a particular branch or decoherent history @xcite of the wavefunction of the entire universe .",
    "the mathematics is the same in either picture : maverick terms collectively have a very small norm that approaches zero as @xmath15 approaches infinity .",
    "this has the same weakness as the earlier mw argument .",
    "for any finite @xmath15 , the state @xmath8 is only approximately an eigenstate of the frequency operator .",
    "the certainty assumption does not specify the outcome of a measurement on an approximate eigenstate , and going further requires an assumption relating the norm of a state vector to the probability of a measurement outcome , which is essentially the born rule .",
    "consider normalized states @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "suppose that , due to fundamental discreteness , one can not distinguish @xmath36 and @xmath37 when @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the direct product states can not be distinguished when ( assuming @xmath39 ) @xmath40 ( we have assumed that @xmath41 is real , which would be the case if @xmath37 resulted from rotating @xmath36 slightly on the bloch sphere .",
    "relative phases could lead to order @xmath42 terms in eq .",
    "( [ dpsi ] ) , which allow an acceptable cutoff of maverick branches for even smaller discreteness scale @xmath43 . ) motivated by this observation , _ we assume that any ( maverick ! ) components of @xmath8 with norm less than @xmath44 can be removed from the wavefunction .",
    "_    we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that quantum gravity suggests a discreteness scale of order @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the characteristic energy of the system described by @xmath36 , in planck units .",
    "equivalently , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the characteristic size , or compton wavelength , of the system .",
    "we can motivate this result by noting that quantum gravity seems to imply a minimal length @xcite of order the planck length .",
    "a minimal length restricts our ability to distinguish two different orientations of an experimental apparatus , such as a stern - gerlach device for measuring the orientation of a spin .",
    "( rotation of the device by an angle less than @xmath49 does not displace any component by more than the planck length . ) thus , the resulting ambiguity in the spin state even after an ideal measurement is at least of order @xmath43 given above ( see fig .  [ figure ] ) .",
    "there is no way to ensure that the ensemble states @xmath36 are identical to accuracy better than @xmath43 .",
    "for example , each time we pass a spin through the stern - gerlach device to produce another @xmath36 there can be no guarantee that the stern - gerlach device remains in precisely the same orientation .    while some might consider fundamental discreteness of the space of quantum states ( previously referred to in the earlier paper @xcite as discrete hilbert space @xcite ) to be a radical notion , we find asserting its absolute continuity in the absence of any supporting experimental evidence to be perhaps just as speculative .",
    "consider the case of spacetime : few would claim that spacetime must be absolutely continuous ( in fact , most likely it is not @xcite ) ; why should quantum state space be different ?",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the discreteness we propose has nothing to do with the dimensionality of state space .",
    "rather , it has to do with whether the coefficients @xmath50 in an eigenstate expansion @xmath51 are continuous or can only take on a discrete set of values ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we have not specified the concrete realization of discreteness , other than to assume that states can be defined only modulo some fundamental uncertainty .",
    "there are many ways to define the evolution of a state in a discrete state space .",
    "one method would be to write the time evolution operator @xmath52 as a product of discrete evolution operators @xmath53 and apply this product of operators sequentially to the state , followed by the `` snap to '' rule ( `` snap to nearest lattice site '' ; see fig .",
    "[ figure ] ) after each step .",
    "this is equivalent to taking classical digital computer simulations literally .",
    "that is , by accepting the finite precision of the variable @xmath54 in an ordinary computer program , one obtains a naive discretization of hilbert space with the `` snap to '' rule implemented by simple numerical rounding . _ with limited numerical precision ,",
    "branches of the wavefunction with very small norm are eventually discarded .",
    "_ this scheme leads to small violations of linear superposition , but only at the level of @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath47 , the condition that discreteness have only a small effect on @xmath8 , @xmath55 , leads to a condition on the number of degrees of freedom reminiscent of holography @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath0 is the surface area of the region .",
    "this bound implies far fewer degrees of freedom than the usual extensive scaling @xmath57 .",
    "it can be deduced as a constraint from gravitational collapse @xcite . excluding states from the hilbert space of the @xmath58 volume which would have already caused gravitational collapse to a black hole , we find the stronger condition @xmath59 .    ) are identified .",

    "consider the spin example from the first section .",

    "@xmath63 has a sharp maximum at @xmath64 and rapidly decreases for @xmath65 sufficiently far from it . the maximum results from a competition between the combinatorial factor ( multiplicity ) , which is peaked at @xmath66 , and the product @xmath67 , which is peaked at either @xmath68 or @xmath69 , unless @xmath70 is extremely close to @xmath17 .",

    "@xcite offers a valid guide , the number @xmath43 may be much smaller than @xmath98 , so that even if @xmath15 is as large as avogadro s number , @xmath99 will still be a small number ( see example below ) .",
    "however , an experimenter is unlikely to be able to measure more than a small fraction of the outcomes that determine his branch .",
    "recall that in mw a particular branch of the wavefunction is specified by the sequence of outcomes @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath15 is the _ total number _ of decoherent outcomes on a branch , so it is typically enormous  at least avogadro s number if the system contains macroscopic objects such as an experimenter .",
    "the experimental outcomes available to test born s rule will be a much smaller number @xmath101 corresponding to a subset of the @xmath20 directly related to the experiment .",
    "any deviation from the born rule of order @xmath96 will be well within the experimental statistical error of order @xmath102 .",
    "therefore the born rule will be observed to hold in all the branches which remain after truncation due to discreteness .",
    "this would , however , not be true if we were to set @xmath43 to zero , in which case @xmath95 would be infinite .    for definiteness ,",
    "consider the following numerical example .",
    "let the discreteness scale be truly tiny : @xmath103 , and let @xmath104 , which is the hubble four - volume in fermis .",
    "then @xmath105 , so unless experimenters can measure more than @xmath106 quantum outcomes , they will have insufficient statistics to exclude any of the maverick branches which remain after truncation .",
    "if we assume the copenhagen ( collapse ) interpretation , our analysis describes when the born rule can be supplanted by the weaker assumption of certainty of measurement outcome when the measured state is an eigenstate . in a discrete hilbert space",
    "it is natural to extend the notion of eigenstate , so that states within the discreteness distance @xmath43 of an eigenstate will also be considered eigenstates .",
    "( more precisely , we can not distinguish between any two such states . ) as discussed in the previous section , for large ( but finite ) @xmath15 , @xmath8 is approximately an eigenstate of any statistical operator ( such as the frequency operator , but also higher moments ) with eigenvalue equal to the born rule value .",
    "for example , the wavefunction is sharply peaked at the born rule frequency value of @xmath107 .",
    "if , motivated by the discreteness scale @xmath43 , we simply modify the certainty assumption to include states which are approximate eigenstates , we will have deduced the born rule from a more elementary assumption .",
    "there is , however , a technical difficulty in defining how close a state @xmath8 is to being an eigenstate of an operator such as the frequency operator .",
    "it would be natural to impose a certainty criteria as follows . given @xmath8 satisfying @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an eigenstate of the frequency operator with eigenvalue @xmath110 , we identify @xmath8 with @xmath109 and require that a measurement of the frequency on @xmath8 return the value @xmath110 with certainty .",
    "the problem arises because , for finite @xmath15 , no choice of @xmath111 is an exact eigenstate of the frequency operator ( except in the trivial cases where @xmath36 is already an eigenstate such as @xmath112 or @xmath113 , and in those cases @xmath110 is either zero or one ) .",

    "( @xmath8 and @xmath114 live in hilbert spaces of very different dimensions . ) one has to rely on some other criterion for identifying a state @xmath8 as a frequency eigenstate .",
    "one possibility is to use the width of @xmath115 about the maximum , in comparison to some @xmath43-dependent quantity . when the width is sufficiently small , the certainty assumption is assumed to apply .",
