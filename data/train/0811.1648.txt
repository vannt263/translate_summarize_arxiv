    "its magnitude is large for energies close to the edge of the gap @xmath212 .",
    "let us now consider a single superconducting wire attached to the ring .",
    "as before , we must consider separately the contribution from states with energies within and away from the superconducting gap . to analyze the spectrum for energies @xmath213 , it is convenient to write the retarded green s function as follows : @xmath214 being @xmath215 and @xmath216 , with : @xmath217    substituting in ( [ teqring ] ) , the transmission function reads : @xmath218 being @xmath219 which results in a lorentzian - type profile as in the case of eq .",

    "( [ overg ] ) , which in the present case are the solutions of the following dyson s equations : @xmath223 within the gap , these functions have , respectively , quasiparticle and quasihole states , behaving as follows : @xmath224 being @xmath225/l$ ] , where @xmath226 for @xmath227 with @xmath228 integer while @xmath229 otherwise , and @xmath230/ \\partial \\omega | _ { \\stackrel{\\sim}{\\varepsilon}_m ( \\phi ) } /l \\}^{-1}$ ] . in what follows , we shall approximate @xmath231 , which becomes exact in the limit @xmath232 .",
    "the full retarded green s function is , in turn , determined from : @xmath233 as in the previous section , the ensuing solution has a quasiparticle bcs - like structure : @xmath234 with @xmath235 given in ( [ epm ] ) , with @xmath236 and @xmath237 given in eq .",
    ".    therefore , for a single superconducting wire connected to a large enough ring , andreev levels tend to coincide with free particle and hole energies : @xmath238 and @xmath239 , respectively , provided that @xmath240 , @xmath241 . the corresponding transmission function is formally given by eq .",
    "( [ teqf ] ) .    in conclusion , a single superconducting wire attached to",
    "the ring generates the same qualitative behavior as l superconducting wires attached in a translational symmetrical way , but the effect is @xmath242 and tends to be negligible as @xmath243 .",
    "we have presented a representation of keldysh green s functions for stationary transport problems in systems with superconducting and normal components .",
    "as most of the relevant observables , like the currents , depend on normal propagators , we have worked with dyson s equations in order to eliminate the anomalous ones .",
    "this procedure has been carried out by defining auxiliary hole propagators and effective self - energies that contain multiscattering terms . in the resulting representation ,",
    "the green s functions exhibit the same structure as in normal systems .",
    "this allows for the derivation of simple and compact expressions for the currents and the transmission functions , that are similar to the ones presented in refs . for normal systems .",
    "we have presented general expressions for the currents in stationary conditions , distinguishing two situations : biased systems where transport is induced by a voltage difference and equilibrium currents induced by a static magnetic flux . in the case of biased systems , we have defined normal and andreev transmission functions and we have compared them with results obtained in the framework of previous formalisms , in particular , the one presented by blonder , tinkham and klapwijk .",
    "we have , finally focused in the study of the behavior of the equilibrium currents in a tight - binding normal ring with attached superconducting wires .",
    "these currents result as superpositions of the currents of all the states of the ring with energies @xmath238 bellow the chemical potential of the wires , in which electrons circulate with velocities @xmath244 .",
    "our main conclusions on the qualitative behavior of these currents are the following : ( i ) the states with energies lying away from the energy window defined by the superconducting gap present an identical qualitative behavior as those of rings attached to n wires .",
    "in particular , they have a periodicity of @xmath160 as functions of the external flux .",
    "the spectral profile related to these currents is a collection of lorentzian functions which implies a decrease in the amplitude of the current due to inelastic scattering effects via the escape to the leads .",
    "\\(ii ) the states with energies within the superconducting gap of the wires , behave as isolated in the sense that the spectral weight related to them consists in a collection of delta functions , indicating the lack of inelastic scattering effects .",
    "the positions of the energy levels is , however , affected by the proximity effect and they are organized in a structure that replicates the quasiparticle spectrum of a bcs tight - binding superconducting ring with cooper pairs of momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the effective bcs tight - binding parameters are the hopping , which is the bare hopping of the ring renormalized by a factor @xmath208 and a gap , which is the gap of the superconducting wires renormalized by a factor @xmath245 .",
    "the renormalizing factors depend on the superconducting coherence length of the wires and the degree of coupling between the wires and the ring .",
    "the latter effect is controlled by the strength of the coupling between these systems as well as on the number of attached wires . for a single attached wire , it is @xmath242 and , thus , not significant for large enough rings .",
    "\\(iii ) although the proximity effect induces andreev levels that replicate the structure of quasiparticle states of a superconducting ring within the energy window defined by the superconducting gap of the wires , these states correspond only to the subspace with winding number @xmath0 .",
    "since the periodicity in @xmath164 of the persistent currents in superconducting rings is explained by a shift in the winding number @xmath207 commensurate with the reciprocal lattice of the ring , @xcite the restriction of the subspace with @xmath0 does not allow for such a mechanism .",
    "the consequence of this rigidity is that andreev states have the same periodicity @xmath160 as the states of the normal ring .",
    "let us , however , mention that the rigidity of the winding number could be due to the rigid bcs mean field approximation considered to model the external wires",
    ". there exists the possibility that a more flexible model allowing for spacial fluctuations of the parameter @xmath246 within a region of the external wires that is close to the contacts could also permit fluctuations in the winding number @xmath207 of the induced andreev sates within the ring . a possibility to explore",
    "this mechanism is by recourse to a self - consistent approximation similar to that of refs . and .",

    "we summarize the procedure introduced in ref . to eliminate the degrees of freedom of the external wires in the dyson s equation for the central system .",
    "it is convenient to change the basis in @xmath10 as follows : @xmath247 with @xmath248 , which leads to : @xmath249,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath250 , and @xmath251 being @xmath252 .",

    "these steps can be repeated with each contact , which allows for the one by one elimination of the degrees of freedom of all the wires .",
    "the limit to the size of the wires going to infinite is summarized in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "we now evaluate the spectral functions @xmath268 $ ] corresponding to the self - energies defined in the previous appendix in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath269 .",
    "this corresponds to replacing @xmath270 in the expressions ( [ self ] ) : @xmath271 the final result is : @xmath272s^+(\\omega)+ [ \\omega- r(\\omega)]s^-(\\omega ) \\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma^{gf}_{\\alpha}(\\omega)&= & [ \\gamma^{fg}_{\\alpha}(\\omega)]^*= \\mbox{sg}(\\omega ) \\frac{|w_{c , \\alpha}|^2}{2 w_{\\alpha}^2 } \\frac{\\delta_{\\alpha}}{r(\\omega ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times [ s^{+}(\\omega)+s^{-}(\\omega)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
