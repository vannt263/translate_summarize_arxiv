    "the fluids and plasma exhibit in two - dimensions a strong tendency to self - organisation in the undriven evolution towards stationary states . as shown by experiments and numerical simulation ,",
    "the @xmath0 fluids and plasmas reach states of high coherency of the flow , generated by concentration of vorticity in few large scale vortical flows .",
    "the process is essentially non - dissipative since the energy is almost conserved during this process .",
    "the presence of dissipation is however essential since breaking up of streamlines and reconnection into larger structures is only possible in the presence of irreversible resistive - like mechanisms .",
    "the vortex merging is the typical process and a large number of studies have been done both experimentally and by numerical simulation .",
    "when the initial state is turbulent one may invoke arguments related with the inverse cascade of energy in @xmath0 but this approach has limitted relevance when the process has evolved to the point where the number of cuasi - coherent structures is large : the high number of irreducible correlations necessary to describe a statistical ensemble of turbulence with embedded structures invalidates any perturbative considerations .",
    "the problem of evolution towards the asymptotic coherent flow states is very complex and possibly different approaches must be developed to examine different aspects of it . for the states close to the final , organised one , the field theoretical formulation seems adequate .",
    "this is confirmed by the purely analytic derivation of the _ sinh_-poisson equation ( describing the asymptotic states of the euler fluid ) and by the derivation of a new equation , for plasma and planetary atmosphere vortices , with substantial practical confirmation .",
    "the particular nature of the physical systems that are investigated is reflected in construction of the lagrangian of the field theoretical model : for point - like vortices we have to adopt an algebraic formulation of the fields , namely @xmath1 . for short range interaction",
    "we need the higgs mechanism to generate a mass for the photon , and this imposes a particular form for the scalar matter self - interaction .",
    "finally , in particular cases it appears possible that the @xmath1 structure is reduced to the abelian substructure ( this is possibly similar to the _ abelian dominance _ ) and the nature of the extrema of the action functional changes significantly .    in the present work",
    "we apply the results of the models developed before .",
    "since these models lead to equations describing the stationary states ( flows ) of lowest energy of the physical systems , the application should consists basically in solving these equations and confronting with experiments or observations .",
    "however some of these equations are already known and eventually they have been derived from different considerations , like the statistical theory .",
    "we will make a comparison between our approach and the statistical one .",
    "the following partial conclusions seem to be supported by the analysis of the applications that are presented below .    1 .",
    "the field theoretical model of the current profiles in tokamak is compatible with the liouville equation .",
    "comparison with the model of j. b. taylor gives interesting suggestions for the physical interpretation of the ft parameters .",
    "2 .   for the euler fluid",
    "we obtain in ft a possible confirmation of the existence of a current of vorticity leading to concentration into filaments .",
    "3 .   for the @xmath0 plasma in strong magnetic field",
    "we obtain patterns of vortical flows that confirm previous numerical calculations .",
    "4 .   for the lh transtion",
    ", we obtain , after a renormalisation of the larmor radius into an _ effective _ larmor radius , profiles of electric fields at the edge ( in h mode ) that are compatible with the experiments 5 .   for the density pinch",
    "we are able to build a physical picture that is consistent with the idea that the pinch of density is due to a pinch of vorticity .",
    "6 .   for the @xmath0 atmosphere",
    "we obtain quantitative results that compares ( very ) well with the observations of _ tropical cyclone_. 7 .   for the _ abelian dominance _",
    "model the first results show the existence of ring - type vortices .",
    "the various physically relevant cases are included in the following classification    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]",
    "there are at least three physical problems that may imply a description in terms of the liouville equation :    1 .",
    "the _ natural current profile _ in tokamak plasma 2 .",
    "the _ snake _ of density in jet and other tokamaks 3 .",
    "the _ filament _ of current density developed on a particular magnetic surface in tokamak ( see * huysmans * )    the last two phenomena seem to result from a concentration of a scalar field ( density and respectively the current density ) and show robustness .",
    "the last property is an indication that the system has reached an equilibrium that is of a purely nonlinear nature , analogous to the relaxed states , therefore they could be derived from the extremum of an action functional .      the statistical theory of j.b .",
    "taylor ( and also : montgomery , etc . ) relies on the principle of _ maximum entropy _ , keeping the total energy and the total number of particles constant .",
    "it leads to the liouville equation .",
    "the _ constant entropy _ principle used by minardi leads to the equation for the current and is well verified by statistical analysis of the peaking factors for current , density , pressure .",
    "the statistical studies carried out on a large set of discharges with the purpose of testing the prediction of the turbulent equipartition theory have suggested that the current density is given by the equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant . replacing @xmath4 and assuming that two space integrations are possible without introducing new physical effects , we would have the equation@xmath5that",
    "can be seen as a small @xmath6 approximation to@xmath7 = 0\\]]we just note that this equation is of a similar form as@xmath8that describes the superfluid streamfunction in the * abelian - higgs * model .",
    "actually these equations are _ not _ compatible , except when taking the lagrangian multiplier @xmath9 negative .",
    "this suggests that the principle of constant entropy used by minardi can not be derived from the topological theory of vortices in superfluids",
    ".    we will examine below the taylor approach to the natural current profile in tokamak .",
    "the _ snake _ phenomenon has been observed in jet during the experiments of pellet injection and consisted in formation of persistent density perturbations at rational-@xmath10 surfaces .",
    "these structures persist over several sawtooth collapses and are difficult to explain as magnetic perturbations . on the other hand",
    "there are indications that the tokamak plasma density has an anomalous radial pinch , much larger than that of the neoclassical origin . apparently in the class of phenomena",
    "one should also include the persistent impurity accumulation in laser blow - off injected impurity , observed in experiments in tcv .",
    "there are several studies of the statistical properties of the correlations between the peaking factors for density , current density or pressure , with plasma parameters and these studies seem to support the idea of turbulent equipartition of the theromodynamic invariants .",
    "however we should note that these studies involve quantities expressed as global variables ( like averages ) and they can hide other dependences not immediately obvious .",
    "we consider the possibility that the particle density behavior ( and particularly the _ snake _ phenomenon ) can be connected with the existence of attracting solutions of certain nonlinear integrable equations .",
    "the reason to consider the _ sinh_-poisson equation comes from the existing proofs that this equation governs the asymptotic states of ideal fluids , or , more generally , of @xmath0 systems that can be reduced to the dynamics of point - like elements interacting by the potential which is the inverse of the laplacean operator ( jackiw and pi , spineanu and vlad ) .",
    "this equation is however obtained when there are two kinds of elements ( like positive and negative vorticity ) and they are of equal number , @xmath11 .",
    "then the _ sinh_-poisson equation is obtained as governing the states with maximum entropy of the discrete statistical system at negative temperature ( montgomery _ et al . _ ) . since the equation for the current density mentioned above",
    "is derived under the assumption of turbulent equipartition , the two descriptions may be related .",
    "however , the solutions for the _ unbalanced _ system of elements , @xmath12 , @xmath13 $ ] have been obtained numerically ( pointin and lundgren ) and have been shown to have higher entropy and higher stability than those of the _ sinh_-poisson , precisely the characteristics we are seeking for .",
    "the limiting form of the unbalanced equation is the liouville equation , @xmath14 .",
    "the model is simplified in order to exhibit the essential aspect of current self - organization in tokamak .",
    "the equation is@xmath15or@xmath16with@xmath17    in the work of j.b . taylor ( 1993 )",
    "it is shown that a reasonable assumption is that the current density should consists of _ filaments _ , acted upon by @xmath18 as a velocity field and with @xmath19 as time .",

    "we can say that the passage of the system from a concentrated current profile to a hollow current profile includes a state of strong localisation , where the natural space unit is extremely small , which means that different parts of the system are separated and non - interacting ( physically this means chaos and uniform current everywhere ) .",

    "the vorticity @xmath417 and the particle density @xmath418 are strongly connected in @xmath0 tokamak plasma .",
    "then we must look to the intrinsic evolution of the vorticity profile since from this we can draw conclusions about the density pinch .",
    "when we apply the bogomolnyi procedure to the action functional for @xmath0 plasma and atmosphere we find equations describing the stationary states which formally would correspond to _ self - duality _ , plus an additional energy which does not have a topological character .",
    "we can assume that the equations describe states which are actually quasi - stationary and that the additional ( or residual ) energy term provides a estimation of the possibility that the system still continues to evolve .",
    "this assumption is valid if we can prove that the evolution is slow , which means that the system behaves adiabatically .",
    "although this perspective is not clear yet , we will take it as a basis to investigate the evolution of the vorticity profiles in tokamak , under the field theoretical formulation .",
    "we first recall that in the model of j.b .",
    "taylor of natural current profiles in tokamak it is identified a quantity playing the role of a _ magnetic temperature _ for the statistical ensemble of current filaments .",
    "this temperature is related with the peaking factor of the profile and it is shown that when the magnetic temperature reaches a critical value , @xmath419 , the profile of the current shows a high degree of concentration , in a form of a single current filament on the magnetic axis .",
    "this is valid for his statistical ( maximum entropy ) theory whose analytical result is the liouville equation for the flux function .",
    "however the theory does not provide a physical reason that a possible evolution of the system would consist of an evolution of the magnetic temperature toward the critical value .    in the field",
    "theoretical formulation of the same physical model ( which also derive the liouville equation ) the physical parameters are @xmath56 ( the coefficient of the chern - simons term in the lagrangian ) and the electric charge @xmath420 ( which is actually the elementary current @xmath21 of the discrete model ) .",
    "the later can be absorbed into the definition of the potential since the connection between the matter field @xmath242 and the interaction ( gauge ) potential @xmath421 needs not be parametrized in any physical way , being established at the level of the discrete model . therefore the quantity that is still present is @xmath56 . on the other hand , comparing the taylor model with the field theory model , we find the relationship between the parameters,@xmath422from which we see that a very peaked current profile in the form of a concentrated filament , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath423corresponds in field theory to very high values of @xmath56 .",
    "while in the statistical model we can not find an intrinsic reason for @xmath424 to approach ( from above ) the critical value @xmath48 , we can look for the presence of an equivalent tendency in the field theoretical model , asking when there can be reasons for @xmath56 to increase adiabatically its value .    in the field",
    "theoretical model for the @xmath0 plasma , where @xmath56 is identified as the sound speed@xmath425we can assume that @xmath56 behaves as @xmath297 , since we take the external confining magnetic field as constant , @xmath426const",
    ". then an increase of @xmath56 can result from an increase in @xmath297 .",
    "physically this is not acceptable when the variation of the temperature is not considered , as was one of our basic assumption .",
    "then what can provide us with an increase of the larmor radius ?",
    "a careful consideration of the physical model underlying the field theoretical formulation may clarify this problem .",
    "the discrete system is based on the idea that elements of vorticity interact on distances of the order of the larmor radius @xmath297 ( the inverse of the mass of the photon in our theory ) and this parameter is taken constant throughout .",
    "however in the plasma there is another ` field ' that has a strong connection with the vorticity : the density @xmath427 . due to the compressibility of the ion polarization drift velocity",
    ", the density is not constant in the chm plasma ( as opposed to the euler fluid case ) .",
    "the spatial variation of the density ( _ i.e. _ @xmath428 ) is the cause for the diamagnetic flow with the velocity @xmath429 .",
    "the interaction between point - like vortices of the discrete model adapts itself to the presence of two velocities : one is the velocity @xmath409 , simply associated with the vorticity , with which the cluster of point - like vortices ( _ i.e. _ the physical vorticity ) is in the relationship @xmath430 .",
    "the other is the diamagnetic velocity of the plasma , @xmath431 essentially induced by density gradients .",
    "the distance of interaction between two elementary vortices is modified with the factor@xmath432since this has been proven that affects directly the larmor radius , replacing the physical parameter @xmath297 with an effective one , @xmath413,@xmath433it is this quantity that appears systematically when vortical motion is examined in tokamak plasma , as illustrated below by the treatment for a drift wave vortex .",
    "then we should accept that our field theoretical formulation , based on a constant @xmath297 can only be valid on small patches , and there , with actually the _ effective _ larmor radius .",
    "then we have that the parameter @xmath56 , the coefficient of the chern - simons term in lagrangian , has a slow  spatial variation coming from the spatial variation of @xmath415 , which , in turn is given by the difference between the plasma _ rotation _",
    "velocity @xmath409 and the ion _ diamagnetic _ velocity @xmath431 .",
    "the first conclusion that we can draw at this moment is that an evolution of the density profile that leads to an increase of the gradient ( _ _ i.e .  _",
    "_ @xmath412 smaller ) will increase the diamagnetic velocity and then @xmath431 tends to approach from below the plasma rotation velocity @xmath409 . in consequence",
    "the factor @xmath434 becomes smaller and the effective larmor radius increases .",
    "this is translated in the field theoretical model in an increase of @xmath56 .",
    "if we follow the analogy presented above , according to which the increase of @xmath56 is equivalent to @xmath435 , we find that there is an enhanced clusterization of the elements of vorticity , with a possible evolution toward a single filament in the center .",
    "this process is not stationary since it has a positive feedback : the clusterization of the vorticity toward the center drags the density ( basically from ertel s theorem , but the process is more complex ) and the evolution of the density increases the gradient and consequently the diamagnetic velocity .",
    "the effective larmor radius increases and the parameter @xmath56 increases which still enhances the clusterization process for the vortical elements .",
    "however there is a limit to this process , coming exactly from the same reason for which the vorticity and the density evolve together and exhibit an inward pinch in tokamak .",
    "the limit consists of the fact that the factor @xmath436 ends up by saturating the process of pinching , due to a too large increase of the effective larmor radius .",
    "when the effective larmor radius is too big , the interaction between the elements of vorticity is no more of short range but can be considered of long range . or , this is the case of the euler fluid , where the range of interaction is coulombian ( _ i.e. _ @xmath437 ) . for the euler fluid",
    "there is no compressibility of the background density , the density and the vorticity are decoupled and the density can not follow the vorticity .",
    "the compressibility of the ion polarization drift is proportional with the _ inverse _ of the square of the effective larmor radius and this diminishes accordingly .",
    "the fluid becomes less hasegawa - mima and more euler .",
    "actually the state where @xmath438 corresponds exactly to the two fluids : hasegawa - mima ( because the density is adiabatic and then @xmath438 ) and euler ( since there the range of interaction is infinite , coulombian ) . but the directions from which the two fluids arrive at this state are completely different .",
    "this intuitive representation of the density pinch ( via the vorticity pinch ) may be useful .",
    "however the field theory introduces an additional factor in this model : the fact that intrinsically the _ quasi - self - dual _ solutions have an adiabatic evolution related with the existence of a residual energy which is _ not _ of a topological nature .    for the eq.([usplus ] )",
    "the residual energy puts severe limitations to the increase of the normalized value of the streamfunction .",
    "any @xmath6 that is greater than @xmath439 is strongly inhibited by a severe increase of this residual energy . or , the concentration in the center of the vorticity is in general accompanied by an increase of @xmath6 .",
    "we should note however that for a normalized domain of integration @xmath440 of the order greater than @xmath441 the value of @xmath6 is already smaller than @xmath442 , and the limitations imposed by the residual energy are far .",
    "moreover , the graph of this residual energy shows that there is a favorable slow evolution for the small values of @xmath6 since close to @xmath443 the energy is decreasing with increasing @xmath6",
    ".    we still have to work on that .      in *",
    "stationary vortices drift waves ( nycander ) * it is derived the equation @xmath445where @xmath446and the normalizations are usual : @xmath297 , @xmath447 and @xmath448 for space , time , potential . from here",
    "we derive , taking constant temperature @xmath449where we defined @xmath450such that when @xmath451we have @xmath452**the two velocities , * * @xmath410 * *  and * * @xmath409 * *  are in the same direction ( positive ) when the density decreases radially , which is normal in tokamak . *",
    "* therefore we have that @xmath453if the velocity of plasma rotation is higher than the diamagnetic rotation . when the diamagnetic rotation becomes comparable with the plasma rotation velocity , just slightly lower ,",
    "this factor is almost zero and the _ effective lamor radius _ becomes infinite .",
    "this work is intended to provide arguments in favor of validity and usefulness of the field theoretical approach to the description of fluids and plasmas in the evolution towards asymptotic , coherent structures .",
    "the basis material consisting of definition of the lagrangians , equations of motion and self - duality states are presented elsewhere and is not mentioned here .",
    "the applications are only shortly presented .",
    "we focused on various instruments , like the field - theoretical currents , energy and action functional in close proximity of the self - duality .",
    "we have noted that there are important aspects that can be examined using these instruments , specific to the field theory :    * the existence of the current of point - like vortices , which can explain the concentration of vorticity * the slowing down of the evolution in the cuasi - asymptotic state , where the number of vortices is still not the minimum that is obtained as the pure extremum of the action at self - duality * the importance of parameters like the coefficient of the chern - simons factor , in the adiabatic change of the regimes ; * the role of the effective spatial dimension , which is adjusted spontaneously via the gradients of the vorticity field .",
