    "in the last decades , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods have been extensively used in the field of quantum many - body physics .",
    "many of these numerical techniques rely on stochastic propagation in imaginary time and can provide extremely accurate results for the thermodynamic and static properties of many - body systems , even in those where quantum correlations make unavoidable the use of non - perturbative approaches.@xcite the main drawback of qmc methods is the difficulty arising in the calculation of spectral functions . these functions , which are particularly relevant for the study of the dynamical properties of quantum many - body systems ( e.g. the excitation spectrum or the transport coefficients ) , can be obtained as fourier transforms of real - time correlation functions .",
    "a qmc calculation of these quantities , however , is particularly inefficient since the rapidly oscillating exponentials appearing in the definition of real - time propagators make the statistical errors grow exponentially with time .",
    "many approximation schemes have been developed and used to investigate the dynamic properties of quantum many - body systems .",
    "for instance , centroid  @xcite or ring - polymer molecular dynamics@xcite has been successfully applied to the study of quantum many - body systems in the semi - classical regime . in the limit of zero temperature ,",
    "an alternative approach is to use correlated perturbation theory@xcite relying on the ground - state properties of the system obtained with qmc calculations .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless , the mainstream approaches to the calculation of spectral functions from qmc simulations consist in attempting a numerical inversion of a laplace transform .",
    "this integral transform relates the desired spectral functions to the correlation functions in imaginary time , easily attainable with qmc methods .",
    "however , the inverse laplace transform of noisy data is an ill - posed problem .",
    "this means that , given a particular set of data for the imaginary - time correlation function , it is hardly possible to recover a unique , well - defined solution to the problem .",
    "sophisticated regularization techniques can then be used to reproduce a reasonable estimate of the spectral function .",
    "@xcite in the last decades , several algorithms to deal with the inverse laplace transform of noisy data have been proposed ,  @xcite but these methods can only be reliably applied to the analysis of the low - energy dynamic properties of quantum systems , since the laplace kernel tends to suppress high - energy contributions . in order to overcome these limitations and to get more accurate results of spectral functions from qmc data ,",
    "it is necessary to develop new estimators for the quantum time correlation functions .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we propose to infer the dynamic structure function of a quantum system at zero temperature from a qmc estimation of the corresponding correlation function in complex time .",
    "similar approaches have been already used for studying the dynamic properties of quantum systems at finite temperature @xmath2 . in this case , the @xmath3 term ( with @xmath4 ) appearing in the definition of the thermal averages can be considered as an evolution operator in imaginary time .",
    "thus , the real - time correlation function can be rewritten in terms of a correlation function in complex time ,  @xcite which can be calculated using path - integral formalism@xcite and estimated in qmc calculations.@xcite even though this estimation is reliable only for times @xmath5 , the spectral functions obtained within this approach exhibit a significant improvement over the results derived from analytic continuation of imaginary - time correlation functions .",
    "@xcite    our goal is to extend this formalism to the calculation of ground - state time correlation functions , even considering that at zero temperature the notion of complex time has not a precise physical meaning .",
    "this strategy allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter , namely the phase @xmath0 of the complex time @xmath6 ) and real time ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "more precisely , we sample paths connecting two configurations distributed according to the ground - state wave function of the quantum system and calculate , over these paths , the propagator at the complex time @xmath8 . changing the phase @xmath0",
    ", we can find an optimal value for which the correlation functions estimated with qmc are affected by moderate statistical errors and , at the same time , present a relevant amount of information on the real dynamics of the quantum system .",
    "this approach makes it possible to infer the spectral functions using rather simple inversion techniques since the ill - posed character of the inversion procedure is appreciably reduced . in this way",
    ", more accurate and more stable results than the usual ones , based on the inverse laplace transform of imaginary - time data , can be obtained .",
    "similarly to what happens in the case at finite temperature , the qmc estimation of the ground state correlation function in complex time is reliable only up to a certain value of @xmath9 depending on @xmath0 , above which the statistical error becomes too large and makes the numerical results meaningless .",
    "it is therefore crucial to develop strategies that make the range of accessible times as large as possible . in this work",
    ", we propose to tackle this problem using high - order approximations for the quantum propagator .",
    "@xcite in particular , we show that the propagator derived by zillich _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is particularly suitable for the complex - time evolution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the qmc method that we have devised for the calculation of complex - time correlation functions and , more briefly , the inversion method that we have used to obtain the dynamic structure function . in sec .",
    "iii , the results obtained with this method in one - dimensional problems are shown and compared with the standard approach relying only on imaginary - time correlation functions . finally , the summary and main conclusions are reported in sec .",
    "the main objective of our work is the calculation of ground - state time correlation functions of a quantum system . at zero temperature ,",
    "a general time correlation function is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are time - independent quantum mechanical operators in the schrdinger picture corresponding to measurable observables , @xmath13 is the hamiltonian , and @xmath14 is the ground state . for the sake of simplicity , in the following we consider correlations among operators which are diagonal in coordinate space and use one - dimensional notation (",
    "the generalization to multi - dimensional space is straightforward ) .    the main idea of this work is to calculate @xmath15 , defined in eq . [ eq : definitionc ] , where @xmath8 has been analytically extended to the complex plane .",
    "we indicate with @xmath16 and @xmath17 the modulus and the phase of the complex time , @xmath18 , respectively . in order to elaborate a form for the estimator of @xmath15 implementable in computer simulations , we rewrite eq . [ eq : definitionc ] in the coordinate space , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the propagator from position @xmath21 to position @xmath22 in complex time @xmath8 , and",
    "@xmath23 is a normalization constant . in the general case of complex time @xmath8 ,",
    "the propagator @xmath24 is a complex function that becomes real and positive only when @xmath8 is a purely imaginary time .",
    "thus , the function @xmath24 can not be used as a probability distribution function for the sampling of coordinates in any qmc algorithm ( as it is normally done , for instance , in the pimc method ) .",
    "therefore , what we do is to sample first the positions @xmath21 and @xmath22 according to a probability distribution constructed from an accurate approximation to the ground - state wave function .",
    "this sampling can be performed using any conventional qmc technique at zero temperature . in this work",
    ", we use the path integral ground state ( pigs ) method .",
    "@xcite then , having sampled the positions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we calculate @xmath15 estimating the quantity @xmath25 .    in order to carry on this procedure one needs to know the exact form of the green s function @xmath24 for any value @xmath8 , but this is in general unknown .",
    "however , what is possible is to construct accurate approximations to the propagator in the limit of small @xmath26",
    ". then , to estimate @xmath15 for larger values of @xmath27 we use the path - integral formalism to rewrite @xmath28 as a convolution of @xmath29 propagators of a shorter time @xmath30 , @xmath31    within this approach , it becomes necessary to sample all the configurations @xmath32 , i.e. , to build paths from the position @xmath21 to the position @xmath22 .",
    "however , the choice of the probability distribution @xmath33 for these paths is not trivial and depends on the system studied .",
    "generally , we notice that using imaginary - time propagator to this end is not a good choice , because in this case the sampled paths would remain close to the minimum energy path and the estimator would not be able to capture all the contributions to @xmath34 coming from the excited states . as a simple and flexible enough option , it is possible to choose @xmath35 as the product of @xmath29 free propagators of imaginary - time step @xmath36 , @xmath37 with @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ eq : free ] , @xmath39 is the number of particles , @xmath40 is the dimensionality of the system , and @xmath41 .",
    "this choice indeed allows to construct the paths by means of simple sampling techniques which do not require a large computational effort , like for instance the staging algorithm .",
    "@xcite in the case of quantum systems interacting with a smooth potential , we notice that it is possible to obtain good results for @xmath15 using @xmath35 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ppath ] , provided that the parameter @xmath36 is properly chosen .",
    "indeed , we see that the variance of the estimator for @xmath15 is reduced when the free propagator in the imaginary time @xmath36 is similar to the modulus of the kinetic propagator in the complex time @xmath42 .",
    "since the purpose of this work is to test our qmc approach in two model systems interacting with smooth potentials ( the quantum harmonic and quartic oscillators ) , we decide to use this choice of @xmath35 with @xmath43)^{-1}$ ] to perform the sampling of the paths @xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless , this may not be the best choice in general , and one may have to use more sophisticated and more computationally demanding algorithms for the sampling of the paths .",
    "once the probability distribution @xmath35 is chosen , the expression of the ground state complex time correlation function becomes @xmath44    at this point , one has to choose an approximation scheme for @xmath45 in order to derive an analytical expression that can be implemented in computer simulations .",
    "increasing the number of convolution terms @xmath29 , and thus decreasing the modulus of @xmath42 , it is possible to systematically improve the quality of the approximation and to asymptotically recover the exact correlation function .",
    "nevertheless , every propagator @xmath46 introduces an oscillating phase term in the integrand of eq .",
    "[ eq : definitioncimportancesampling ] , and thus the statistical noise of the estimator for @xmath15 increases notably when @xmath29 becomes large . in order to obtain reliable results ,",
    "it is fundamental to develop numerical strategies that keep the number @xmath29 of convolution terms as low as possible .",
    "the simplest approximation to the propagator is the primitive approximation ( pa ) , which relies on the factorization @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the kinetic and potential operators , respectively . in this scheme",
    ", the complex - time propagator can be written as @xmath50    the pa approximation is easily implementable within our qmc procedure but requires a large number @xmath29 of convolution terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : definitioncimportancesampling ] . in order to improve the accuracy ,",
    "it is important to use higher - order approximations to the complex - time propagator . in conventional pimc simulations , a significant improvement in efficiency",
    "can be obtained using symplectic expansions of the time - evolution operator that incorporates double commutators between kinetic and potential operators .",
    "@xcite for local potentials , these commutators lead to extra terms that are exponentials of the gradient of the potential squared times the third power of the time step .",
    "the inclusion of this contribution in the propagator largely improves the efficiency of the pimc  @xcite and pigs  @xcite methods . in imaginary - time propagation",
    ", the contribution of the double commutator always appears in the argument of the exponential with a negative sign .",
    "however , in complex time this sign turns out to be positive for @xmath51 , producing largely increasing amplitudes and thus unreliable results that make the use of this high - order scheme unpractical ( see appendix a ) .",
    "therefore , it is very important to look for other expansions which can improve the pa but that do not include double - commutator terms .    a high - order approximation for the complex - time propagator without double commutator has been reported in ref . . in that work ,",
    "the authors were able to improve the quality of the small - time propagator by introducing a linear combination , with some negative coefficients , of different symplectic expansions on the same time .",
    "this expansion has some drawbacks when used in conventional pimc simulations , since it gives rise to an approximation for the imaginary - time propagator which is not positive definite .",
    "this feature does not represent a problem here , since in the calculation of @xmath15 the complex - time propagator is not used as the probability distribution of the monte carlo sampling but rather as the estimator .",
    "once we have chosen the approximation for the complex - time propagator , the only thing that is still lacking in order to calculate @xmath15 is the normalization constant @xmath52 .",
    "this can be computed imposing the autocorrelation function of the identity operator to be @xmath53 for any value of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , if we define the complex quantity @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the chosen approximation for the time propagator , the complex - time correlation function in eq .",
    "[ eq : definitioncimportancesampling ] can be written as @xmath56 the bracket @xmath57 indicates the averages over the configurations @xmath58 sampled following the scheme described above , i.e. , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 sampled according to a reasonable approximation of the ground - state wave function , and @xmath59 sampled according to the probability distribution @xmath60 .",
    "summarizing , the evaluation of @xmath15 ( [ eq : cmontecarlo ] ) for a given complex time @xmath61 consists of the following steps :    1 .   to generate the @xmath21 and @xmath22 configurations according to the probability distribution @xmath62 , by means of a qmc technique at zero temperature , like the pigs algorithm .",
    "2 .   to choose @xmath29 ( number of points of the discrete path from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) , so that the parameter @xmath63 is sufficiently small to recover the @xmath64 limit . in practice , one selects the value of @xmath29 that makes @xmath65 , where the parameter @xmath66 depends on the accuracy of the approximated action .",

    "[ eq : reversa ] is extremely sensitive to errors in the vector @xmath73 .",

    "the goal is however to keep the regularization parameter @xmath90 as small as possible yo avoid introducing unwanted artifacts in the reconstructed solution .",
    "in practice , the choice of the regularization parameter must avoid two different problems .",
