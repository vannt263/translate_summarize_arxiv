    "although the postshock ionization depends on the thermal history of the plasma , to zeroeth order the ionization is independent of the temperature history and the specific ionic species in the plasma @xcite , and can be characterized by the so - called ionization age , @xmath29 .",

    "solar abundances are assumed for each star / wind , and all simulations are performed in the centre of mass frame .",
    "the nature of the wcr is largely governed by the ratio of the cooling timescale for the shocked gas to the dynamical timescale for it to flow out of the system , which is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the preshock velocity in units of @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the stellar separation in units of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the stellar mass - loss rate in units of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "another key parameter governing the nature of the wcr is the ratio of the orbital speed to the pre - shock wind speed , @xmath42 .",
    "this ratio affects the aberration angle of the wcr [ @xmath43 and its degree of downstream curvature due to coriolis forces .    in this work",
    "we consider systems with identical or similar wind momenta .",
    "this means that radiative braking @xcite effects are negligble , and in all cases a normal wind - wind pressure balance exists . in future work",
    "we will extend our investigation to systems with higher wind momentum ratios , to study the effects of braking and the dynamics of the wcr when the more powerful wind overwhelms the weaker wind and the wcr collapses onto the surface of one of the stars .",
    "in model cwb1 we suppose that two identical o6v stars move around each other in a circular orbit with a period of 3 days .",
    "the stellar separation is @xmath26 , and each star has an orbital velocity @xmath44 .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath45 can be obtained by determining the speed of the winds at the stagnation point where momentum balance is achieved . ignoring for the moment effects due to the orbital motion of the stars and the presence of two radiation fields",

    "this implies that @xmath47 , and the postshock gas would not be expected to cool back to @xmath48k until it had left the central regions of the system .",
    "in fact , we shall see that once the simulation starts , the reduction in the net radiative flux due to the presence of the companion star reduces the acceleration of each wind towards its companion .",
    "this `` radiative inhibition '' @xcite reduces the pre - shock velocities below @xmath46 , which increases the cooling in this model ( see table  [ tab : keyparams ] , which summarizes some of the salient features directly obtained from the hydrodynamcial simulations ) . neglecting radiative inhibition again , we also find that @xmath49 , indicating that the wcr will display a reasonably large aberration angle and downstream curvature due to coriolis forces .",
    "these effects become more pronounced if there is a significant reduction in wind speeds along the line - of - centres due to raditive inhibition .",

    "* and references therein ) , hd165052 @xcite , and hd159176 @xcite .",
    "all of these systems have near identical main - sequence stars of spectral type o6-o7 , and circular or near - circular orbits with periods near 3 days .",
    "hence the hydrodynamics of and emission from the wcr in model cwb1 will be a reasonable approximation to the situations in these systems .",
    "in some of these systems it may be difficult for the winds to attain a normal ram - ram pressure balance , and the stronger wind may push the wcr onto the surface of the star with the weaker wind .",
    "detailed simulations of each individual system are needed to ascertain whether , in fact , this occurs .",
    "reflection and distortion effects may also well be important in these systems , but are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "model cwb2 uses the same stars as model cwb1 , but increases the orbital period to 10 days ( the stellar separation becomes @xmath27 ) . the pre - shock collision speed on the line of centers ( neglecting radiative inhibition ) increases to @xmath50 , as the winds now have more room to accelerate .",
    "the higher collision speed leads to higher postshock temperatures , and together with the increased stellar separation produces lower postshock densities .",
    "the result is that cooling within the wcr is dramatically reduced ( @xmath51 ) , and the postshock gas behaves largely adiabatically .",
    "the reduced orbital speed and higher pre - shock wind speeds also means that the aberration and curvature of the wcr will be smaller in this model than in model cwb1 . taking account of radiative inhibition we again find slightly increased cooling and orbital effects ( see table  [ tab : keyparams ] ) .",
    "model cwb2 is similar to hd93161a , an o8v + o9v system with a circular orbit and an orbital period of 8.566 days @xcite , albeit with slightly more massive stars and powerful winds .",
    "another system with not too dissimilar properties is plaskett s star @xcite , though this object contains stars which have evolved off the main sequence .",

    "hence in 3 days this travels a distance of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the minimum distance from the centre of the grid to its edge is @xmath79 , so we expect the wcr to curve through 16 per cent of a full rotation , or about @xmath80 .",

    "adopting a @xmath82 terminal wind speed in the dynamical model results in slightly less aberration and downstream curvature , while specifying a @xmath83 terminal wind speed results in much greater aberration and a much tighter downstream curvature compared to the hydrodynamical models .",

    "in contrast , the trailing edge of the wcr is very much denser , and remains much more normal to the wind .",

    "the expected postshock temperature behind a high mach number shock which is normal to the preshock flow is given by @xmath93k , where @xmath94 is the average mass per particle .",
    "given the observed preshock wind speeds along the line of centres we expect a postshock temperature @xmath95k , which is indeed what is seen .    in wide cwbs where the winds collide at their terminal speeds",
    "the maximum postshock temperature is produced at the apex of the wcr where the shocks are normal to the flow .",
    "for a given preshock speed , oblique shocks are less efficient at thermalizing the flow and produce lower postshock temperatures . however , in systems where the winds collide prior to reaching their terminal speeds the hottest temperatures in the wcr can in fact be obtained far downstream of the wcr apex , as we now explain .",
    "the increased distance from the stars to the shocks means that the winds have more time to accelerate and collide at higher speed .",
    "while these increased speeds may be offset by the increasing obliquity of the shocks , in cases where the wcr is strongly radiative and thus susceptible to kinking by thin shell instabilities , some parts of the wcr surface ( and thus the shocks ) can be normal to the preshock flow .",
    "this combination of high preshock speeds and normal shocks can result in the hottest plasma temperatures actually occuring far downstream .",

    "[ fig : statistics](b ) would seem to contradict this statement , but this is only because the ordinate as plotted does not extend to low enough values ) .    in model cwb1 , the densities between the stars are sufficiently high for the shocks to be collisional .",

    "the most striking difference is that the postshock gas remains largely adiabatic , flowing out of the system while still relatively hot .",
    "this was anticipated since the estimated value of @xmath45 is substantially larger than unity .",

    "[ fig : cwb123_density](b ) also shows that there is a density gradient across the flow direction in the downstream parts of the wcr ( i.e. there is a reduction in density from the contact discontinuity towards the leading shock , and an increase towards the trailing shock ) .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour already noted in model cwb1 , being caused by the slower exit out of the system of the gas in the wcr than in the winds , and the shadowing introduced by the curvature of the wcr which results in low densities ahead of the leading shock , and therefore seems to be a general property of cwbs with equal winds ( the unequal winds case , discussed in sec .",

    "we again overplot results from the dynamical model of @xcite .",
    "the contact discontinuity traced by the red line was calculated assuming terminal wind speeds of @xmath82 , while the green line is from a model with wind speeds of @xmath129 .",
    "both models assumed that the shocked wind flowed ballistically once it had reached 85 per cent of its terminal speed .",
    "clearly the model which assumes the higher terminal wind speeds is a better match to the hydrodynamical calculation , which indicates that the downstream morphology of the wcr is not solely dependent on the pre - shock wind speeds along the line of centres .",
    "@xcite noted that due to the curvature of the wcr by the orbital motion of the stars , kh instabilities occurred even when the winds had equal speeds .",
    "there is no sign of this in our model , but this could be because of the higher ratios of @xmath130 in some of lemaster et al.s models .",

    "the lower temperatures near the leading shocks arise because the leading shocks are more oblique at a given downstream distance than the trailing shock .",
    "hence , in systems with identical winds the gas near the leading shocks is both less dense and cooler than gas near the trailing shocks , and vice - versa .",
    "the situation changes slightly in systems with unequal winds , as noted in section  [ sec : dynamics_cwb3 ] .    in model cwb2 the postshock ion and electron temperatures at the apex of the wcr equilibrate in about 2 hours .",

    "a distinct difference between the wcr in model cwb3 compared to the other models is that its apex occurs closer to one star ( the o8v secondary star which has the weaker wind ) than the other star ( the o6v primary star ) due to the unequal wind momentum ratio ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb123_density]c ) .",
    "the gas downstream of the wcr apex is also pushed closer to the secondary star , due to the greater momentum flux of the primary wind . these effects , together with the fact that the winds are still accelerating when they collide , plus the enhanced terminal wind speed of the o6v star , lead to higher preshock and postshock speeds in the primary wind relative to the secondary wind .",
    "this has three major consequences : i ) there is a velocity shear along the contact discontinuity between the winds , which excites kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ; ii ) to maintain pressure balance , the preshock and postshock density of the secondary wind exceeds that of the primary wind ; iii ) higher postshock densities , together with reduced postshock speeds , results in the gas on the secondary side of the wcr radiating more efficiently ( this is discussed in more detail in a forthcoming paper on the x - ray emission ) .",
    "there is also a clear signature of radiative inhibition : at the primary wind shock on the line - of - centers , the pre - shock speed is @xmath157 , whereas without the companion star it is @xmath158 at this distance . hence the radiation field of the secondary star reduces the net acceleration of the primary wind towards it by @xmath159per cent .",
    "likewise , the pre - shock speed of the secondary wind on the line - of - centers is @xmath160 , whereas the single star solution has a speed of @xmath161 at this distance , indicating a reduction in the acceleration of @xmath162per cent .",
    "radiative inhibition thus has a greater effect on the secondary wind , as expected .",
    "there is no sign of radiative braking @xcite , though this is not surprising given the low wind momentum ratio ( hence wind opacity ratio ) in our model .    also overplotted on fig .",

    "gas in the denser parts of the wcr typically reaches speeds of @xmath167 in the orbital plane by the time it leaves the hydrodynamic grid .    using the measured pre - shock velocities along the line of centres to determine the cooling parameter @xmath45 , we find that @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",

    "as one might expect given the large differences between models cwb1 and cwb2 , the structure and properties of the wcr in model cwb4 undergoes rich and dramatic changes as a result of the varying separation between the stars as they progress in their respective orbits .",

    "fig : statisticscwb4 ] ) .",
    "for instance , the velocity profiles between the stars along the line of centres from model cwb4 at periastron and apastron are in good agreement with those from models cwb1 and cwb2 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , there are some interesting differences . for instance , some dense clumps of cool gas exist within the wcr even at apastron , in contrast to the entirely hot state of the wcr in model cwb2 .",
    "these clumps were formed during the previous periastron passage . because of their high density and inertia relative to the surrounding hot , more rarefied , plasma , it can take some considerable time for the faster flowing hot plasma to push the clumps out of the system .",
    "clearly this timescale is of the order of half the orbital period of the stars in model cwb4 .",
    "the slow acceleration of the clumps out of the system also results in some of the clumps crossing the global shocks bounding the wcr and moving into the fierce high speed environment of the unshocked winds ( this is clearly seen at phases @xmath196 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_density ] ) .",
    "this process occurs because the hot plasma in the wcr responds quite quickly to the movement of the stars ( and thus rotates with the stars ) , whereas the direction vectors of the dense clumps respond much less rapidly and the clumps tend to maintain straighter paths .",
    "for this reason the clumps exit only out of the trailing shocks of each arm of the wcr , and not out of the leading shock .",
    "once formed , the clumps are gradually destroyed by thermal evaporation and ablation , with larger and denser clumps surviving longer .",
    "the presence of clumps in or around an otherwise adiabatic wcr may affect some observational signatures .",
    "for instance , gas mixed from the clumps into the surrounding flow `` mass - loads '' it , making it denser .",
    "the effect of the clump on the temperature of the surrounding flow is more complex .",
    "a bowshock forms upstream when the surrounding flow is supersonic with respect to the clump , heating the surrounding flow .",
    "this is seen , for example , when the clumps move out of the wcr and into the unshocked winds .",
    "bowshocks also form upstream of clumps _ within _ the wcr when the clumps are far enough downstream that the hotter flow past them is supersonic - this is the case for the lowermost clump above the wcr apex in the apastron panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_density ] .",
    "friction between the clump and a surrounding subsonic flow also heats the flow .",
    "further downstream , the addition of mass into a flow generally leads to lower temperatures once the injected mass is fully mixed into the flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though this will require reconnection of field lines in a magnetic environment .",
    "the presence of clumps outside the main wcr may also lead to more of the winds kinetic power being processed through shocks than would otherwise be the case , and may affect the variation of , for example , the x - ray emission with phase .",
    "finally , the boundary layer between clumps and the surrounding diffuse flow contains intermediate densities , temperatures , and velocities , all of which affect the resulting emission @xcite . line emission is expected to be particularly sensitive to the conditions in this region , and such regions may help to explain discrepancies in current models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where mixing of cold material into a hotter medium is neglected .",
    "another difference with our previous models is that cold dense gas does not exist far downstream of the apex of the wcr when the stars are at periastron , whereas it does in model cwb1 ( compare the top left panels in figs .  [",
    "fig : cwb4_density ] and  [ fig : cwb4_temperature ] with figs .",

    "the hottest gas occurs at apastron ( @xmath207k ) , and its temperature is similar to the hottest gas in model cwb2 . while the maximum gas temperature attains a minimum around periastron ( @xmath208k ) , this value is found in localized bowshocks enveloping dense clumps in the downstream flow and is sensitive to rapid changes in the local dynamics .",

    "[ fig : cwb4_temperature ] also reveals that at periaston the trailing edge of each arm of the wcr is hotter than the leading edge .",

    "[ fig : statisticscwb4](d ) compares the distributions between models cwb2 and cwb4 at apastron .",
    "they are remarkably similar , except again model cwb4 displays a relative mass excess at speeds @xmath217 , which is likely due to the presence of cold clumps .",
    "the distributions of hot ( @xmath216k ) gas are also remarkably similar .",
    "[ fig : statisticscwb4](e ) shows mass versus temperature histograms from models cwb1 and cwb4 at periastron .",
    "model cwb4 has more than twice as much mass at temperatures above @xmath218k , but less mass at lower temperatures , due to the reduced cooling in the post - shock history of the downstream gas in model cwb4 . at apastron ,",
    "model cwb4 has slightly less mass at @xmath219k compared to model cwb2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : statisticscwb4]f ) , but significantly more mass between temperatures of @xmath220k .    the volume versus temperature histograms from models cwb1 and cwb4 at periastron",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : statisticscwb4](g ) .",
    "there is a significantly greater volume of gas at @xmath221k in model cwb4 .",
    "this excess combines with a reduction in the relative volume of gas at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath222k ) .",
    "these differences reflect the hotter thermal history of the shocked gas in model cwb4 prior to periastron . at apastron in model cwb4 , the volume of hot gas at temperatures above @xmath223k is @xmath224 per cent smaller than in model cwb2 .",
    "model cwb4 generally also has smaller volumes of gas at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath225k )  this is likely a numerical effect due to the higher resolution in model cwb4 compared to model cwb2 , which leads to a narrower layer of intermediate temperature cells at the unresolved shocks .",
    "model cwb4 has almost an order of magnitude greater volume of gas at @xmath226k than model cwb2 .",
    "such temperatures are encountered in the mixing regions downstream of the clumps in model cwb4 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : cwb4_3dtemp2 ] ) .",
    "the model results described above reveal a wealth of interesting dynamical effects which occur in short period , o+o binaries , including radiative inhibition , rapid postshock cooling , and powerful instabilities , all of which had been expected .",
    "however , there have also been some surprising findings , such as the ability of cold dense clumps to exist for substantial periods of time in the wcr when current postshock conditions are largely adiabatic .",
    "another surprise is that the slow exit velocity of these clumps out of the system allows some of them to exit the wcr through its trailing shock .",
    "more generally , the presence of clumps increases the complexity of the wcr , affecting the density , temperature and velocity of the shocked plasma , and allowing additional material to be processed through normal shocks . as a result",
    ", the emission from the wcr may be affected in a non - trivial manner",
    ".    in future work we will study the multi - wavelength emission from these models , and will repeat our study for wr+o systems where we expect radiative braking to have a significant effect on the dynamics , and the observed emission to show greater orbital modulation due to the larger differences in the attenuation through the stellar winds .",
    "braking should also be important in o+o systems where there is a larger ratio of wind opacities than explored here .",
    "we will also turn our attention to modelling specific systems , with the aims of determining key system parameters and understanding the natures of the diverse range of wind - wind interactions which occur .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank ken gayley , the referee , for a very helpful report , and stan owocki and ross parkin for many interesting and useful conversations .",
    "i would also like to thank the royal society for a university research fellowship .",
