    "although the standard model ( sm ) is successful in describing almost all experimental results of high energy physics in terms of gauge theory , the dynamics responsible for the elerctroweak symmetry breaking is unknown . in the minimal version of the higgs sector ,",
    "one higgs doublet field is introduced as an effective description of the dynamics below some cutoff scale @xmath27 .",
    "constraints from electroweak precision measurements indicate that @xmath27 is at least beyond 3 tev . on the other hand",
    ", this scale already introduces a fine - tuning problem of the higgs mass term at the @xmath28 % level .",
    "this is called a little hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "little higgs models  @xcite were proposed as a solution to the little hierarchy problem . in these models",
    ", the higgs doublet field appears as pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons of new strong dynamics at the cutoff scale .",
    "a remarkable property is that the one - loop quadratic divergence to the renormalization of the higgs mass term is cancelled by a proper choice of global and local symmetries , so that the cutoff scale can be pushed to @xmath29tev without a severe fine - tuning .",
    "a simple case is called the littlest higgs model  @xcite where the higgs field is realized as a part of the ng bosons associated with the global symmetry breaking of su(5 ) to so(5 ) and the gauge symmetry is [ su(2)@xmath30u(1)]@xmath31 .",
    "then the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass term in the sm is cancelled by the extra gauge bosons and the heavy partner of the top quark .",
    "subsequent studies  @xcite , however , showed that these heavy partners need to be heavier than several tev to satisfy severe constraints imposed by precise electroweak measurements , hence reintroducing some degree of the fine - tuning problem . in the littlest higgs model with t parity ( lht )",
    "@xcite , the model is extended to have a @xmath32 parity so that the heavy gauge bosons assigned to be t - odd particles do not directly couple with a pair of the sm fermions , and the phenomenological constraints are somewhat relaxed .",
    "flavor physics provides an interesting possibility to explore the lht . in order to assign t parity",
    ", we need to introduce extra fermions ( t - odd fermions ) which are left - handed su(2 ) doublets .",
    "then , the flavor transition can arise in the vertices of heavy gauge bosons , t - odd fermions and ordinary sm fermions .",
    "there are two 3@xmath303 unitary matrices describing these flavor transitions associated with quark and lepton sectors besides the ordinary flavor mixing matrices in the quark and lepton sectors i.e. the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm )  @xcite and pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns )  @xcite matrices .",
    "these matrices are new sources of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes in the quark sector and lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes in the charged lepton sector . in the early literature on this subject various observable quantities of fcnc and lfv processes were calculated in the lht and showed that the effects of t - odd partners can be sizable and the correlations among various observable quantities can be different from other new physics model such as supersymmetric ( susy ) models  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out later that calculations missed a type of diagrams and the logarithmic dependences on the cutoff scale in the fcnc and lfv amplitudes disappear thanks to new contributions  @xcite , thus reducing theoretical ambiguity associated with the physics at the ultraviolet cutoff scale . branching ratios of various fcnc and lfv processes",
    "were reevaluated including the new contributions  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative feature turned out to be similar to the previous calculation though there were sizable changes at the quantitative level .    in this paper , we present the results of further studies in tau and muon lfv processes .",
    "in addition to branching fractions , we also study observables defined with the help of polarizations of the initial muon and tau lepton  @xcite .",
    "polarized muon experiments can be done using surface muon beams that are 100% polarized in the opposite direction of the @xmath33 momentum .",
    "in fact , a @xmath34 experiment with initial muon polarization is under consideration @xcite . in the tau pair production at @xmath35 colliders ,",
    "the polarization information can be obtained by taking an angular correlation with tau decays on the opposite side @xcite .",
    "the study of polarized tau decays is also being considered for the @xmath7 process at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) where we can utilize the tau polarization from @xmath36 decays  @xcite . in the following , we consider the processes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( @xmath37 al , ti , au and pb ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath38 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath39 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and , @xmath25 .",
    "we define a parity asymmetry in two - body decays and two parity and one time - reversal asymmetries in three - body decays .",
    "in addition , we can define forward - backward asymmetry and forward - backward - angular asymmetries in the cases of @xmath40 and @xmath21 .",
    "we show that the parity asymmetries of two - body decays reflect the characteristic chirality structure of the lfv interactions . for three - body",
    "decays , we find that there are useful relations among various asymmetries .",
    "we calculate the rates of @xmath1-@xmath41 conversions for different muonic atoms and show that the ratios of the conversion rates can vary within 1 order of magnitude over most of the lht model parameter space .",
    "these features , as well as correlations of various branching ratios , can be useful in discriminating different new physics models .",
