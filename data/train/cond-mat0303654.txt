    "2 [ introduction ] a straightforward approach to improving the properties of polymeric materials , such as their stiffness , conductivity , toughness , is to blend two homopolymer species ( a and b ) into a single melt @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases , weak segregation tendencies between a and b monomers  @xcite usually cause such a direct blend to macroscopically phase separate below a critical temperature , or , equivalently , above a critical strength of interaction @xcite .",
    "such phase separation often leads to poor quality materials with non - reproducible morphologies and weak interfaces . to circumvent this problem",
    ", one typically introduces compatibilizers into the system , most commonly multicomponent polymers like block , graft , or random copolymers @xcite",
    ". such compatibilizers preferentially segregate towards the interfaces between the bulk a and b domains , thereby lowering interfacial tensions , stabilizing the formation of complex morphologies @xcite , and strengthening interfaces@xcite .",
    "the compatibilizers so added are usually the most expensive component of a blend , and consequently , theoretical studies of the phase behavior of such blends possess important ramifications in rendering such industrial applications more economically feasible .    here",
    "we examine the phase behavior of a ternary blend of symmetric a and b homopolymers with an added ab block copolymer as a compatiblizer .",
    "specifically , we consider symmetric diblock copolymers wherein the volume fractions of the two different blocks in the copolymer are identical .",
    "moreover , the ratio of the homopolymer and copolymer lengths is denoted as @xmath0 and is chosen as @xmath1 .",
    "this is largely motivated by a recent series of experiments by bates et al .",
    "@xcite on various realizations of the ternary ab+a+b system with @xmath2 .",
    "a combination of neutron scattering , dynamical mechanical spectroscopy , and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) was used to examine the phase behavior .",
    "an example of an experimental phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_exp ] .",
    "it will be discussed in detail further below .",
    "theoretically , one of the most established approaches to studying such polymer blends is the self - consistent field theory ( scft ) , first introduced by edwards @xcite and helfand @xcite and later used , among others , by scheutjens and fleer @xcite , noolandi et al .",
    "@xcite , and matsen et al .",
    "@xcite . in implementing scft @xcite ,",
    "one typically chooses ( a ) a model for the polymers and ( b ) a model for the interactions .",
    "most researches adopt the gaussian chain model , wherein the polymers are represented as continuous paths in space @xcite .",
    "it models polymers as being perfectly flexible , i.e. , there exists no free energy penalty for bending .",
    "instead , it features a penalty for stretching .",
    "( in contexts where the local rigidity or orientation effects are important , the wormlike chain model @xcite serves as a popular alternative . ) such a molecular model for the polymers is typically supplemented by a model for the interactions between unlike polymers , which is usually chosen as an incompressibility constraint plus a generalization of the flory - huggins local contact interaction term , whose strength is governed by the product of the segregation parameter , @xmath3 , and the polymerization index , @xmath4 .",
    "( 60,60 ) ( 10,0 ) ( 5,35 )    we have implemented scft for the above model of polymers , and investigated the phase behavior of the ternary a+b+ab blend .",
    "[ fig : ph_mf ] displays the resulting mean - field phase diagram in the coordinates of homopolymer volume fraction @xmath5 and segregation strength @xmath6 .",
    "note that the phase diagram shown is a slice along the `` isopleth '' where the two homopolymers are blended in equal proportions .",
    "it can be observed that on the copolymer - rich side of the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_mf ] , a line of order - disorder transitions ( odt ) separates the disordered region ( which occurs at low interaction strengths , @xmath6 ) from a periodically ordered ( i.e. , lamellar ) phase at higher @xmath6 . for pure copolymers ( @xmath7 ) , this transition is predicted within mean - field theory to occur at @xmath8 , and the line of odts , often referred to as leibler line , represents second - order transitions . on the homopolymer - rich side of the diagram , we find a line of second - order transitions from a disordered phase at low @xmath6 to a region of two coexisting homogeneous liquid phases at high @xmath6 .",
    "for the pure homopolymer system ( @xmath9 ) , the upper critical consolute point is found by mean - field flory - huggins theory to be at @xmath10 .",
    "this line of continuous transitions is referred to as scott line @xcite .",
    "the point where the leibler and scott lines meet is found , again within mean - field theory , to be an isotropic lifshitz critical point ( lp)@xcite , which in the case of @xmath11 becomes a lifshitz tricritical point ( ltp ) according to broseta and fredrickson @xcite , and is predicted to occur at a total homopolymer fraction of @xmath12 and an incompatibility of @xmath13 . the separation into microphases ( i.e. , lamellae ) observed along the leibler line displays a steady increase in the    ( 70,60 ) ( 10,0 ) ( 5,35 )    lamellar periodicity until it finally diverges at the lp , giving rise to macrophase separation along the scott line . below the lp in the ordered regime , the system undergoes a first - order transition from the lamellar ( l ) to the two - phase ( a+b ) region along the axis of homopolymer concentration , @xmath5 .",
    "contrary to a previous publication @xcite in which this transition was displayed as continuous , a careful reexamination of the mean - field theory reveals that it is indeed first - order with a three - phase ( l+a+b ) coexistence region reaching all the way up to the lp for any @xmath0 .",
    "this is further corroborated by recent results of naughton and matsen@xcite .    the mean - field phase diagram displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_mf ] differs substantially from the experimental phase diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_exp ] . in the experiments ,",
    "the lp was destroyed by fluctuations , giving rise to a bicontinuous microemulsion phase in its vicinity . at lower temperature @xmath14 ,",
    "the l and a+b phases were conjectured to be separated by a narrow channel of this microemulsion phase stretching down from the lifshitz region , while the leibler and scott lines were shifted from their mean - field locations to lower temperatures ( i.e. , higher @xmath6 , which is proportional to @xmath15 ) .",
    "experimental results are consistent with the picture that as the lamellar periodicity increases along the @xmath5 axis , the persistence length of composition fluctuations along the microdomain boundaries decreases until at some point the two become comparable in size and the lamellae begin to rupture forming a bicontinuous structure .",
    "the experimental results discussed above , while in contradiction to the mean - field scft calculations , are not entirely surprising when viewed in the context of theoretical studies pertaining to the effect of fluctuations on the mean - field phase diagrams .",
    "indeed , even in the context of the pure diblock copolymer ( i.e.  @xmath7 ) , leibler @xcite speculated that the order - disorder transition ( predicted to be second order within the mean - field theory ) would become a weakly first - order transition when the effects of fluctuations are accounted for .",
    "such a reasoning was confirmed quantitatively by fredrickson and helfand@xcite , who extended an earlier analysis by brazovskii @xcite to show that fluctuations change the order of the transition and also shift the transition to higher incompatibilities , @xmath6 .",
    "further , they quantified such shifts in terms of a parameter that depends on the polymer density ( or , equivalently in the context of a polymer melt , their molecular mass @xmath4 ) .",
    "this parameter , denoted generically as @xmath16 in this text , acts as a ginzburg parameter @xcite , and in the limit @xmath17 , the mean - field solution is recovered .",
    "the present study is motivated by the hypothesis that the fluctuation effects not accounted for within scft are responsible for the discrepancies noted between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions for the ternary - blend phase behavior . as a partial confirmation of our hypothesis , the experimental phase diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_exp ] ) of bates and co - workers deviate most clearly from the mean - field diagram for the pee / pdms / pee - pdms system , in situations where the molecular weights were much lower than in the other systems ( i.e. , where the @xmath16 parameter is small ) .",
    "this article presents a theoretical examination of the effect of thermal fluctuations upon the phase behavior of ternary blends .",
    "our primary goal is to understand and quantify the shift in both the leibler and scott lines and to examine the formation of the microemulsion phases in such systems .",
    "bicontinuous structures such as the ones observed in the above experiments are particularly interesting from an application point of view in that they are able to impart many useful properties on polymer alloys .",
    "for example , if one blend component is conducting or gas - permeable , these properties will be passed on to the entire alloy .",
    "also , mechanical properties such as the strain at break and the toughness index have been observed to exhibit maxima with co - continuous structures @xcite .",
    "previous simulation studies of fluctuation effects in ternary diblock copolymer / homopolymer blends @xcite , have mostly focused on the @xmath11 case . within a lattice polymer model , mller and schick @xcite",
    "have investigated the phase diagram of a corresponding symmetrical a+b+ab blend . according to their results",
    ", the disordered phase extends to higher @xmath6 than predicted by the mean field theory , and the ltp is replaced by a regular tricritical point .",
    "due to finite size effects , the transition to the lamellar phase could not be localized quantitatively .",
    "particle - based models have the disadvantage that one is restricted to studying relatively short polymers .",
    "this motivates the use of field theories in simulations .",
    "kielhorn and muthukumar @xcite have studied the phase separation dynamics in the vicinity of the ltp within a ginzburg - landau free energy functional , which they derived from the edwards model @xcite within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , in the spirit of the theories for pure diblock copolymer systems mentioned earlier @xcite . naively , one should expect that such a description is adequate in the weak segregation limit , where the correlation length for composition fluctuations is large .",
    "however , kudlay and stepanow @xcite have recently questioned this assumption .",
    "they pointed out that the fluctuations in rpa - derived hamiltonians have significant short wavelength contributions which can not be eliminated by renormalization and may lead to unphysical predictions .    in this work",
    ", we propose an alternative field - theoretic approach which rests directly on the edwards model , without resorting to the additional rpa approximation .",
    "the partition function is evaluated with a monte carlo algorithm . a related algorithm ,",
    "the complex langevin method , has been presented recently by two of us @xcite .",
    "here we study two - dimensional ternary blends at @xmath18 with both methods and compare the results .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we outline the field - theoretic formulation of our model .",
    "the simulation method is presented in section [ simulations ] . in section [ results ] , we present and discuss our results before we conclude in section [ summary ] with a summary and an outlook on future work .",

    "the segments are assumed to be perfectly flexible and are assigned a common statistical segment length @xmath28 .",

    "moreover , @xmath59 is real , whereas @xmath61 is imaginary , thereby rendering @xmath55 complex .",
    "the single - chain partition functions can be expressed in terms of the feynman - kac formulae @xcite as : @xmath63 where the propagators @xmath64 satisfy the diffusion equations @xmath65 @xmath66 an analogous diffusion equation applies to the conjugate propagators , @xmath67 , which propagate from the opposite end of a polymer .",

    "the integrand of ( [ eq8 ] ) is approximated by saddle points ( @xmath76 ) such that @xmath77 a homogeneous saddle point then corresponds to the disordered phase , whereas every ordered phase has a unique inhomogeneous saddle point . by examining ( [ eq8 ] ) , it is further apparent that @xmath16 plays the role of a ginzburg parameter in the sense that the mean - field approximation , i.e.  @xmath78)$ ] , becomes exact in the formal limit of @xmath79 , corresponding to @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "implementations of scft @xcite can thus be viewed as numerical strategies for computing the various saddle points .",
    "however , thermal fluctuation effects in the vicinity of phase boundaries invalidate the mean - field results in these regions , and strategies for evaluating ( [ eq8 ] ) must be found .",
    "analytical methods are quite limited , especially for systems dominated by inhomogeneous saddle points , and often involve weak segregation expansions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , earlier publications of two of us @xcite have detailed a new approach termed _ field - theoretic simulations _ , which is a methodology for numerically sampling functional integrals in field - theoretic models of polymer solutions and melts .",
    "the underlying idea is to numerically sample @xmath82 ( independently of the type of ensemble employed ) by generating a markov chain of @xmath83 states with a stationary distribution proportional to @xmath84)$ ] .",

    "such a numerical method is non - perturbative in nature , allowing for a more complete account of fluctuation effects .    in this article",
    ", we undertake field - theoretic simulations to address the effect of fluctuations upon the mean - field phase diagram .",
    "note that to numerically generate the markov chain of @xmath83 states , one needs to account for the fact that @xmath88 $ ] ( ( [ eq : hc ] ) and ( [ eq : hgc ] ) ) in general possesses both real and imaginary parts , implying a non - positive - definite statistical weight @xmath89 . in our previous researches we implemented a general `` complex langevin dynamics '' technique that had been proposed earlier to deal with such non - positive - definite statistical weights @xcite . in view of the fact that this method has been discussed in detail in our previous publications , we restrict our discussion to a brief outline of the technique which is presented in the appendix .",
    "it is to be noted that outstanding issues still remain as regards the theoretical foundations of this technique @xcite . while in our earlier studies we encountered no problems with the convergence or the uniqueness of the solutions , in the present study this method did encounter numerical difficulties , especially in the regions close to the lifshitz point .",
    "these difficulties are associated with strong fluctuations and complex phase oscillations and will be described more fully in a subsequent section . in an effort to probe and overcome the difficulties encountered in preliminary complex langevin simulations of the present ternary blend and",
    "quantify the effect of fluctuations on the phase diagram of this system , we present an alternative , albeit equally rigorous technique for implementing field - theoretic simulations , which we refer to as the _ field - theoretic monte carlo method_. in the discussion of our results , we compare explicitly the results obtained by the latter method with that obtained through the complex langevin method and find good agreement in the range of their validities .",
    "it is pertinent to also note that there also exist real langevin methods in the literature that focus specifically on the @xmath59 fluctuations @xcite .",
    "our approach to sampling ( [ eq8 ] ) is based on the monte carlo method .",
    "we recall that @xmath59 is real and @xmath61 imaginary , and that the fluctuations in @xmath61 are conjugate to the total density .",
    "although the incompressibility constraint implemented in our model effectively only constrains @xmath90 , one might guess that the effect of the @xmath61 fluctuations that impose this constraint is rather small compared to the composition fluctuations governed by @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we shall tackle @xmath59 and @xmath61 in two distinct steps , after which we will be able to argue that the effect of the @xmath59 fluctuations is indeed the dominant one .    to simulate the fluctuations in @xmath59",
    ", we pick a starting density configuration and use the scft mean - field equations @xcite to calculate a seed @xmath59 and @xmath61 .",
    "next , we proceed according to the following scheme :    \\(a ) make a global move in @xmath59 , i.e. , tentatively add a random number @xmath91 $ ] times a step width parameter to every @xmath92 , and denote by @xmath93 the old @xmath59 .",

    "the initial guess for @xmath94 in this iteration , @xmath97 , is taken to be the old @xmath94 from the last monte carlo cycle .",
    "the iteration , which employs a two - step anderson mixing scheme @xcite , is terminated once @xmath98-h[w_-^0,\\bar w_+^0]$ ] is determined to within 0.001 , or a few parts in @xmath99 .",
    "every step in this iteration requires the solution of the diffusion equation ( [ diff ] ) on the entire simulation lattice , and this is where practically all the computing time is spent . the number of iterations to find @xmath100 in most cases is roughly around 10 .",
    "\\(c ) accept or reject the move according to a standard metropolis criterion .",
    "in other words , we always accept the move if the resulting difference in @xmath101 , i.e. ,  @xmath102 , is negative , and otherwise , we accept with a probability @xmath103 .",
    "\\(d ) go back to ( a ) unless the maximum number of monte carlo steps has been reached .",
    "next , we turn to discuss the sampling of @xmath61 fluctuations . as a result from scft , we know that the saddle point @xmath104 of @xmath61 as well as the partial saddle point @xmath105 $ ] are purely real , despite the fact that the integration path of @xmath61 in ( [ eq8 ] ) is along the imaginary axis .",

    "furthermore , we split the argument of the integral in the partition function into a real part and a complex reweighting factor , leading to the following expression for the canonical ensemble : @xmath108 @xmath109)\\big)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath110\\big)\\big]\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the volume occupied by species @xmath30 . in the grand canonical ensemble",

    "each configuration then needs to be weighted with the factor @xmath118 for the purpose of computing averages .",
    "we note that the propagators and the field term in the diffusion equation ( [ diff ] ) are now complex , but the averages of all physical quantities will approach real values in equilibrium .    at this point , a remark concerning our numerical methods is due : the single most time - consuming part in doing our simulations is the solution of the diffusion equation ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "initially , we used either the crank - nicholson ( cn ) or dufort - frankel ( df ) finite differencing schemes @xcite to effectuate this task . as it turned out , however , a pseudo - spectral method that had been used successfully in the past to solve the mathematically very similar schrdinger equation and that had recently been applied to scft @xcite was far better suited for our needs . typically , it allowed for an order of magnitude higher values of contour step @xmath119 than either cn or df to achieve the same accuracy .",
    "implementing the scheme with highly optimized fast fourier transform routines like the publicly available fftw library @xcite , the computing time per contour step is only roughly double that needed for df and half that needed for cn on a single processor .",
    "we therefore regard it as the method of choice in the context of polymer field theory . for the larger system sizes to be discussed in the next section , a parallel version of the code",
    "was used .",
    "evidently , the @xmath61 fluctuations exert their influence on the simulation in two ways : ( a ) through the complex reweighting factor @xmath120 or @xmath121 and ( b ) through the difference of @xmath122 from @xmath102 .",
    "we consider first @xmath121 and to this end split the complex diffusion equation into two real equations for the real and imaginary parts of the propagator for polymers of type @xmath30 , denoted @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "note the symmetry properties of this coupled set of equations with respect to a sign change in @xmath115 : for @xmath125 we obtain @xmath126 we see that @xmath123 remains unchanged whereas @xmath124 goes to @xmath127 .",

    ", the exponent of the reweighting factor @xmath121 is antisymmetric in @xmath115 ( cf .",
    "( [ i_gc ] ) ) . since in the partition function ( [ z_gc ] ) we integrate over all possible configurations of @xmath115 ,",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath121 cancel out for each antisymmetric pair , and consequently , we effectively only need to apply the real part of @xmath121 : @xmath131\\right]\\right).\\ ] ]    these symmetries reveal that in a functional expansion of @xmath132 in @xmath115 around the partial saddle point , @xmath133 $ ] , the even - order terms coincide with the expansion of @xmath129 , and the odd - order terms with that of @xmath130 . moreover , @xmath134 and @xmath135 by virtue of the incompressibility constraint .",
    "hence , @xmath136 and finally @xmath137 + { \\cal o}(\\tilde\\omega_+^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    based on these analytical results , we should expect @xmath121 to deviate only very slightly from unity so that it can be neglected in most practical cases .",
    "hence , the impact of the @xmath61 fluctuations would materialize solely as a ( real ) @xmath138 contribution to @xmath139 .",
    "the above derivation of ( [ o6 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) was for the grand canonical ensemble but holds true if one is to derive analogous relations in the canonical ensemble , as well , because the leading term of @xmath140 is linear in @xmath115 , as in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "it should however be noted that in the canonical ensemble , the gauge invariance of the theory to a constant shift of the @xmath115 field allows the introduction of a spurious phase factor @xmath141 that preserves @xmath55 ( and hence @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "this @xmath144 field will freely move in canonical simulations unless constrained , e.g. , by demanding that @xmath145 .",
    "in contrast , in the grand canonical ensemble , @xmath146 and hence @xmath143 are to lowest approximation quadratic functions around @xmath147 . as a result",
    "the shape of the @xmath148 energy landscape is much steeper in the grand canonical ensemble than in the canonical , and no constraint is needed .    while the above considerations can only give us an indication of the insignificance of the @xmath61 fluctuations , we have also done test simulations to get more conclusive estimates .",
    "we therefore choose the grand canonical ensemble for testing our simulation technique of @xmath61 fluctuations . before starting a run at @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath1 , and @xmath151 , we fully equilibrated a simulation of @xmath59 fluctuations only with the same parameters , which started from a disordered configuration and ran a million monte carlo steps .",
    "this set of parameters is very close to the ( fluctuation - corrected ) order - disorder transition in the phase diagram , on the disordered side .",

    ", we used @xmath154 .",
    "we then took this equilibrated configuration and switched on the @xmath61 fluctuations , again making ten ( global ) moves in @xmath61 after each move in @xmath59 so as to roughly spend equal amounts of computing time for the two types of moves . note in fig .",
    "[ fig : hh ] how @xmath139 quickly increases and then plateaus off , indicating that the @xmath61 fluctuations have become saturated .",
