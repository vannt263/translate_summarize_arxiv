    "considerable progress is being made in advancing ingan light - emitting diodes ( leds ) . however , there are still concerns involving performance limitations .",
    "an example is efficiency loss at high current density ( efficiency droop ) @xcite , which can limit use of leds in applications requiring intense illumination .",
    "understanding and mitigating the efficiency droop mechanism is important .",
    "several explanations have been proposed , including carrier leakage @xcite , auger recombination @xcite , junction heating @xcite , carrier and defect delocalizations @xcite .",
    "the assertions are much debated .",
    "for example , in the case of auger scattering , discrepancy exists in the auger coefficient estimation between experimental - curve fitting and microscopic calculations shen , ryu , hader2,dellaney .",
    "discussions involving ingan led efficiency are commonly based on a rate equation for the total carrier density .",
    "the approach allows one to describe radiative and nonradiative carrier loss rates , where the latter typically includes ad - hoc terms for producing an efficiency droop .",
    "a particularly successful model , in terms of reproducing experimental efficiency versus injection current data , is the @xmath1 model .",
    "@xcite the model s name derives from the three phenomenological constants ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) introduced to account for shockley - read - hall ( srh ) , radiative - recombination and auger - scattering carrier losses , respectively .  bandstructure effects enter indirectly via these coefficients .",
    "it is known that the bandstructure in wurtzite quantum - well ( qw ) structures can change noticeably with carrier density because of screening of the quantum - confined stark effect ( qcse ) @xcite .  incorporating these changes into the @xmath1 model is challenging , without compromising the attractiveness of having only three fitting parameters , each with direct correspondence to a physical mechanism .",
    "this paper considers an alternative that allows direct input of bandstructure properties , in particular , the band energy dispersions , confinement energies and optical transition matrix elements , as well as their carrier - density dependences arising from screening of piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization fields .",
    "the model has the further advantage of providing a consistent treatment of spontaneous emission , carrier capture and leakage , and nonequilibrium effects .",
    "thus , the fitting parameter , @xmath3 is eliminated and effects , such as plasma heating , are taken in account within an effective relaxation rate approximation for carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon scattering .",
    "all this is accomplished by extending a previously reported non - equilibrium led  model that is based on dynamical equations for electron and hole occupations in each momentum ( @xmath5 ) state @xcite .",
    "the additions include an algorithm for simplifying and extracting bandstructure information relevant to the dynamical equations .",
    "detailed bandstructure properties are obtained from solving @xmath6 and poisson equations @xcite . furthermore , since distinction between qw and barrier states is sometimes difficult in the presence of strong internal electric fields , extension is made to treat optical emission from these states on equal footing .",
    "section 2 describes the model , derivation of the working equations and calculation of input bandstructure properties .",
    "section 3 demonstrates the application of the @xmath7resolved model by calculating internal quantum efficiency ( iqe ) as a function of injection current for a multi - qw ingan led .",
    "results are presented to illustrate iqe behavior that may be overlooked when not accounting for the excitation dependences of bandstructure .",
    "most interesting is a possible contribution to efficiency droop from a change in relative emission contributions from qws and barriers .",
    "simulation results are presented to demonstrate the robustness of this mechanism to input parameter variations .",
    "also in this section , a back - of - the - envelop derivation is used to associate the predicted droop to bandstructure changes from screening of qcse .",
    "section 4 further explains the bandstructure - induced droop mechanism by discussing the changes in qw confinement energies and envelop function overlap with increasing excitation .",
    "the section also presents a possible resolution to the discrepancy on the auger coefficient estimation between @xmath1 model and microscopic calculation . with the present model ,",
    "the auger coefficient necessary to maintain an efficiency droop at high injection current , as presently observed in experiments , is in the range of @xmath8 to @xmath9 , which is in closer agreement with microscopic calculations .",

    "<S> bandstructure properties in wurtzite quantum wells can change appreciably with changing carrier density because of screening of quantum - confined stark effect . </S>",
    "<S> an approach for incorporating these changes in an ingan light - emitting - diode model is described . </S>",
    "<S> bandstructure is computed for different carrier densities by solving poisson and k@xmath0p equations in the envelop approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the information is used as input in a dynamical model for populations in momentum - resolved electron and hole states . </S>",
    "<S> application of the approach is illustrated by modeling device internal quantum efficiency as a function of excitation . </S>"
