    "the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in our universe is now well established by a number of observational experiments , especially the very precise measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite .",
    "the measured value of the cdm relic density is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath2 km / mpc / s . though the gravitation nature of the dark matter is established , we know almost nothing about its particle nature , except that it is nonbaryonic and to a high extent electrically neutral .",
    "one of the most appealing and natural cdm particle candidates is _ weakly - interacting massive particle _ ( wimp ) .",
    "it is a coincidence that if the dark matter ( dm ) is thermally produced in the early universe , the required annihilation cross section is right at the order of weak interaction .",
    "the relation between the relic density and the thermal annihilation cross section can be given by the following simple formula @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the annihilation rate of the dark matter around the time of freeze - out .",
    "given the measured @xmath5 the annihilation rate is about @xmath6 pb or @xmath7 .",
    "this is exactly the size of the cross section that one expects from a weak interaction process and that would also give a large to moderate production rate of the wimp at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in general , production of dark matter at the lhc would give rise to a large missing energy .",
    "thus , the anticipated signature in the final state is high-@xmath8 jets or leptons plus a large missing energy .",
    "note that there could be nonthermal sources for the dark matter , such as decay from exotic relics like moduli fields , cosmic strings , etc . in such cases , the annihilation rate in eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) can be larger than the value quoted above .",
    "there have been many proposed candidates for the dark matter .",
    "instead of specifying a particular model we adopt an effective interaction approach to describe the interactions of the dark matter particle with the standard model ( sm ) particles @xcite .",
    "one simple realization is that the dark matter particle exists in a hidden sector , which communicates to the sm sector via a heavy degree of freedom in the connector sector . at energy scale well below this heavy mediator the interactions can be conveniently described by a set of effective interactions .",
    "the strength of each interaction depends on the nature of the dark matter particle and the mediator .",
    "an interesting set of interactions between the fermionic dark matter @xmath9 and the light quarks @xmath10 can be described by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and 1 .",
    "note that due to the following identity @xmath13 the axial tensor @xmath14 is related to the tensor @xmath15 and thus should not be regarded as an independent set .",
    "a more complete set of interactions involving fermionic and scalar dark matter candidates that we will study in this work are listed in table [ table1 ] . without a particular model in mind",
    "we will treat each interaction independently in our analysis .",
    "there have been some recent works on constraining the interactions at present and future collider experiments @xcite and using gamma - ray experiments @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite also wrote down the effective nonrelativistic interactions between the dark matter and nuclei .",
    "there was another work in which the dark matter couples only to the top quark and corresponding predictions at direct and indirect detection experiments as well as colliders are obtained @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we first estimate the lower bounds on the new interactions based on the fact that if a particular interaction is the only contribution that can thermalize the dark matter particle in the early universe , we require this interaction must be strong enough such that the resulting relic density would not overclose the universe .",
    "in addition , we proceed to calculate the antiproton flux coming from the effective interactions .",
    "we expect the latest antiproton data from pamela @xcite can put a strong constraint on the size of the interactions , based on the fact that the existing data do not allow excessive flux above the conventional background .",
    "on the other hand , the positron spectrum from pamela @xcite showed some excessive above the conventional background and thus if we used it to constrain the model , it in general gives a weaker constraint than the antiproton flux @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we focus on the constraints from antiproton flux . similar ideas of using the antiproton flux from earlier pamela data was considered in ref .",

    "iv , we calculate the annihilation rates during the freeze - out and make sure that the interactions would not overclose the universe . in sec .",
    "v , we calculate the antiproton spectrum due to the dark matter annihilation in galactic halo .",
    "we compare with other constraints and conclude in sec .",
    "let us start by assuming the dark matter is a dirac fermion and its effective interactions with light quarks via a ( axial ) vector - boson or tensor - type exchange are given by the following dimension 6 operators @xmath16 where @xmath17 or @xmath14 with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is an effective coupling constant of order @xmath20 .",
    "for majorana fermion the @xmath21 or @xmath22 type interaction is identically zero , and so for vector or tensor type interaction the fermion @xmath9 in eq.([eff - q ] ) is understood to be dirac .",

    "we use the current quark masses in the lagrangian given by @xcite : @xmath27 another light degree of freedom that couples to the dirac dark matter is the gluon field and @xmath28 bosons , because they decay into light quarks which then fragment into @xmath29 .",

    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 or @xmath25 and the strong coupling constant is evaluated at the scale @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dark matter mass .",
    "finally , we also write down the corresponding operators for complex scalar dark matter . again",
    ", we note that the interactions for real scalar dark matter is similar to complex one and differ by a factor of two .",
    "we simply focus on the complex scalar dark matter .",

    "we will consider one operator at a time , and set the coefficient @xmath39 for simplicity .",
    "note that in calculating the annihilation rate in the freeze - out in the early universe , we include all light - quark flavors ( @xmath40 ) as well as the heavy top quark which is relevant when @xmath33 rises above the top quark threshold .",
    "however , in the calculation of the antiproton flux from dark matter annihilation in the present galactic halo , we only include the light - quark flavors .",
    "we ignore the @xmath41 contribution , because the @xmath42 and @xmath43 first decay into @xmath44 before each light quark undergoes fragmentation into hadrons , including proton and antiproton .",
    "therefore , the antiproton spectrum would be significantly softer than the direct fragmentation as in @xmath45 @xcite .",

    "v , we are going to examine the dependence of the annihilation cross section on the velocity of the dark matter particle in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the current velocity of the dark matter in the universe around the sun is about @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the speed of the light . given such a small @xmath86 the dependence on @xmath86 is very important .",
    "for instance , the annihilation rate of the dirac dm with a scalar boson exchange , given by the interaction in @xmath87 , would suffer from a factor of @xmath88 .",
