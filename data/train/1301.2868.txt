    "statistical thermodynamics provides the basic tools needed for understanding macroscopic phenomena in the physical world . among the geometric representations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of physical systems known",
    "are included three kinds of riemannian metric structures to represent fluctuation theorem that have been introduced by weinhold and ruppeiner @xcite .",
    "one of these metrics depends on derivatives of internal energy , while the other depends on entropy .",
    "another useful metric was called fisher - rao metric @xcite .",
    "useful information can be gained about a system by using the thermodynamic curvature @xmath0 of the space of thermodynamic parameters expressed through the second and third derivatives of the partition function or an appropriate thermodynamic potential .",
    "the space of thermodynamic states is flat if there are no interactions between particles and it curves if interactions are present .",
    "the thermodynamic curvature has an interesting behavior close to the critical point which has been shown to be singular for some well - known thermodynamics systems at criticality in which correlation length is infinite ( for a useful review see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamic curvature determines information about interatomic interaction .",

    "janyszek and mrugala @xcite showed that @xmath0 is negative for fermi gas and positive for bose gas .",
    "mirza and mohammadzadeh @xcite worked out the fractional statistics and also ideal q - deformed bosons and fermions which show the proper sign .",
    "it has also been argued that scalar curvature is able to show that the fermion gas is more stable than the boson gas @xcite .",
    "other thermodynamic models , such as phase transition properties of the van der waals gas , have been investigated to find that the singular point of the thermodynamic curvature is consistent with the critical point of the system @xcite . +",
    "a standard scaling for free energy per site @xmath6 in the critical region may be assumed as f(t , h)= ^-1f(t^a_t , h^a_h)=t^(h  t^ ) where , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are scaling dimensions for energy and spin operators , respectively ( @xmath10 designates the critical point ) .",

    "a similar super - exchange model on the kagome lattice has been considered @xcite .",
    "it is known that special cases of the kagome ising model are soluble in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite . in one of the special cases , this model reduces to the fisher model . in this work , we calculated the scalar curvature for the fisher model under the presence of an external magnetic field .",
