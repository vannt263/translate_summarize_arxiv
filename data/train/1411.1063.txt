    "stellar oscillations in cool stars are excited by turbulent convection in the outer layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "oscillation modes can be described by spherical harmonics with spherical degree @xmath0 ( the total number of node lines on the surface ) , azimuthal order @xmath1 ( the number of node lines that cross the equator ) , and radial order @xmath2 ( the number of nodes from the surface to the center of the star ) .",
    "radial pulsations are therefore expressed as @xmath3 , while @xmath4 are non - radial pulsations . modes with higher spherical degrees",
    "penetrate to shallower depths within the star ( figure [ seismo : fig1 ] ) .",
    "oscillation modes can furthermore be separated into pressure modes ( p modes ) and gravity modes ( g modes ) .",
    "pressure modes are acoustic waves propagating through the compression and decompression of gas , and pressure gradient acts as the restoring force .",
    "gravity modes are pulsations due to the interplay of buoyancy and gravity , and buoyancy acts the restoring force .",
    "gravity modes are damped where convection is unstable , and are therefore usually confined to the deep interior for cool stars .",
    "pressure modes propagate in radiative zones , and hence are more easily excited to observational amplitudes on the surface .",
    "oscillation frequencies @xmath5 of high @xmath2 and low @xmath0 can be described by the asymptotic theory of stellar oscillations @xcite , which observationally can be approximated as follows :    @xmath6    here , the large frequency separation @xmath7 is the separation of modes of the same spherical degree @xmath0 and consecutive radial order @xmath2 , while modes with different degree @xmath0 and same order @xmath2 are separated by the small frequency separations @xmath8 . in the asymptotic theory ,",
    "@xmath7 can be shown to be equal to the inverse of twice the sound travel time through the stellar diameter @xcite :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the sound speed .",
    "assuming adiabacity and an ideal gas @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "hence , equation ( [ seismo : dnu_phys ] ) can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath14    the large frequency separation is therefore a measure of the mean stellar density .",
    "the small frequency separations can be written as @xcite :    @xmath15    the integral shows that @xmath16 is sensitive to sound - speed gradient in the stellar interior , which depends on the chemical composition profile .",
    "hence , @xmath16 is sensitive to changes in the chemical composition during stellar evolution and thus stellar age .",
    "equation ( [ seismo : smallsp ] ) can be qualitatively understood by the fact that modes of different @xmath0 travel to different depths within the star , and hence their frequency differences provide information about the radial structure .",
    "an additional asteroseismic observable is the frequency of maximum power , @xmath17 , which is related to the driving and damping of the modes .",
    "the frequency of maximum power has been suggested to scale with the acoustic cut - off frequency @xcite , which is the maximum frequency below which an acoustic mode can be reflected @xcite :    @xmath18    here , @xmath19 is the pressure scale height . for an isothermal atmosphere @xmath20 , which combined with the ideal gas equation yields :    @xmath21    hence , @xmath17 is mainly a measure of the surface gravity of a star .",
    "measurements of @xmath17 , @xmath7 , @xmath16 , or individual frequencies provide a powerful way to determine the stellar structure and fundamental stellar properties ( such as radius and mass ) , which are otherwise difficult to measure for field stars .",
    "validations of asteroseismic results with classical methods such as interferometry and eclipsing binary systems have shown good agreement within the typically quoted uncertainties ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "early efforts to detect stellar oscillations used ground - based radial - velocity observations . the first confirmed detection dates back to @xcite in procyon , followed by the first detection of regularly spaced frequencies in @xmath22boo by @xcite .",
    "the greatly improved sensitivity of doppler velocities for detecting exoplanets enabled the detection of oscillations in several nearby main sequence and subgiant stars such as @xmath23hyi @xcite , @xmath24cena @xcite and b @xcite as well as red giant stars such as @xmath25hya @xcite and @xmath26oph @xcite . at the same time , first space - based photometric observations led to detections with the canadian space telescope most ( microvariability and oscillations in stars , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in red giants @xcite and procyon @xcite .",
    "space - based observations were also performed using the startracker of the wire ( wide - field infrared explorer ) satellite @xcite , the smei ( solar mass ejection imager ) experiment @xcite and the hubble space telescope @xcite . in total ,",
    "observational efforts prior to 2009 yielded detections in @xmath27 stars ( see figure [ seismo : fig2 ] ) .    a major breakthrough ( and commonly referred to as the beginning of the space photometry revolution of asteroseismology ) was achieved by the french - led corot ( convection rotation and planetary transits ) satellite , which detected oscillations in a number of main sequence stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and several thousands red giant stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , corot showed that red giants oscillate in non - radial modes @xcite , which opened the door for detailed studies of the interior structure of red giants ( see section [ sec : redgiants ] ) .",
    "the _ kepler _ space telescope , launched in 2009 , completed the revolution of cool - star asteroseismology by covering the low - mass h - r diagram with detections , including dwarfs cooler than the sun @xcite and over ten thousand red giants @xcite . the larger number of red giants with detected oscillations is due to a combination of two effects : first , oscillation amplitudes increase with luminosity @xcite , making a detection easier at a given apparent magnitude .",
    "second , the majority of _ kepler _ targets were observed with 30-minute sampling , setting a limit of @xmath28 since less evolved stars oscillate above the nyquist frequency .",
    "for evolved stars the p - mode and g - mode cavity can overlap , giving rise to so - called `` mixed modes '' @xcite .",
    "mixed modes contain contributions from g modes confined to the core , but unlike pure g modes can have low enough mode inertias to be observed at the surface . as opposed to p modes , g modes",
    "are theoretically predicted to be equally spaced in period .",
    "the coupling of p modes with g modes causes mixed modes to be shifted from their original frequency spacing @xcite , yielding multiple frequencies per radial order which are expected to be approximately equally spaced in period .",
    "the detection of mixed @xmath29 modes in red giants by _ kepler _ @xcite led to several important discoveries in our understanding of the internal composition and rotation of giants . following the observational confirmation of equal period spacings @xcite",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that giants ascending the rgb and he - core burning red giants can be separated based on their mixed - mode period spacing ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "shortly after , @xcite showed that mixed modes are split into multiplets by rotation , and that frequency splittings for g - dominated mixed modes are substantially higher than for p - dominated mixed modes due radial differential rotation .",
    "core rotation rates were subsequently measured for hundreds of red giants , allowing an unprecedented view in the internal rotation evolution of evolved stars .",
    "figure [ seismo : fig3 ] shows seismically measured core rotation rates as a function of stellar radius for a sample of subgiants @xcite and red giants @xcite .",
    "the data show that the cores spin up as stars evolve towards the rgb , followed by a gradual spin - down as stars evolve towards the he - core burning main sequence .",
    "predicted core rotation rates in models are up to factors of 10100 larger than observed @xcite , pointing to a yet unidentified mechanism responsible for transporting angular momentum from the core to the envelope .",
    "the exquisite observational data promise significant advances in our theoretical understanding of the different roles of angular momentum transport mechanisms in stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "transit and radial velocity surveys measure exoplanet properties relative to stellar properties , hence requiring a precise characterizations of host stars .",
    "asteroseismology is a powerful tool to provide such characterizations in a systematic fashion . in particular , for observations with sufficiently high precision such as provided by _",
    ", both planetary transits and stellar oscillations can be measured using the same data ( figure [ seismo : fig4 ] ) .    to date",
    ", nearly 80 _ kepler _ host stars have been uniformly characterized using measurements of @xmath17 and @xmath7 , yielding precise ( @xmath30 3% ) radii for over 100 exoplanet candidates ( figure [ seismo : fig5 ] , * ? ? ?",
    "for a smaller sample detailed frequency modeling has yielded even more precise radii , masses and ages with typical uncertainties of 1% , 2% and 10% , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "efforts to derive precise and accurate seismic ages for more than 30 _ kepler _ host stars are currently under way ( davis et al , in prep ; silva aguirre et al .",
    ", in prep )",
    ".    comparisons with high - resolution spectroscopy for _ kepler _ hosts showed that previous estimates of @xmath31 for evolved host stars were significantly overestimated , while characterizations for dwarfs generally show good agreement ( figure [ seismo : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the majority of _ kepler _ host stars , however , still rely on photometric classifications from the kepler input catalog @xcite , which have been suggested to suffer from biases for dwarfs @xcite .",
    "asteroseismology will continue to play a key role to accurately quantify such biases through the calibration of less direct methods which are applicable to larger samples such as photometric flicker @xcite or spectroscopy .",
    "in addition to rotation periods , rotational splittings can be used to determine the line - of - sight inclination of the stellar rotation axis by measuring the relative heights of the @xmath32 modes in each multiplet @xcite . for dipole ( @xmath29 ) modes , a doublet implies a high inclination ( rotation axis perpendicular to the line of sight ) , while a triplet implies an intermediate inclination . observing a single peak does not constrain the inclination since the star can either have a low inclination ( pole - on ) or show no splittings because of slow rotation .",
    "stellar inclinations are important for studying the architecture and dynamical history of transiting exoplanets by constraining the angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit axis ( the obliquity ) . since the presence of transits shows that the orbital axis is perpendicular to the line of sight , a low stellar inclination automatically implies a misalignment of orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the star ( a high obliquity ) .",
    "high obliquities are frequently observed in stars hosting hot jupiters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while stars hosting multiple coplanar planets have been observed to have low obliquities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this has been taken as evidence that the formation of hot jupiters is related to dynamical interactions , rather than migrations through a protoplanetary disk .",
    "high - precision photometry by _ kepler _ and corot have enabled asteroseismic stellar inclination measurements for several exoplanet systems @xcite .",
    "an intriguing example is kepler-56 , a red giant hosting two transiting planets initially confirmed through transit - timing variations @xcite .",
    "the kepler-56 power spectrum shows dipole modes which are split into triplets ( figure [ seismo : fig6 ] ) . modeling the frequency triplets yielded an inclination of @xmath33 degrees , and demonstrated the first stellar spin - orbit misalignment in a multiplanet system @xcite .    follow - up radial velocity observations of kepler-56 with keck / hires revealed a long - term trend due to a massive companion on a wide orbit . assuming a significant mutual inclination between the outer companion and the inner transiting planets",
    ", dynamical simulations showed that the misalignment can be explained by the precession of the orbital axis of the inner planets due to the torque of the wide companion ( figure [ seismo : fig7 ] ) , a scenario which has previously been proposed theoretically @xcite .",
    "further simulations confirmed that the misalignment in kepler-56 is consistent with a dynamical origin due to an inclined perturber @xcite .",
    "kepler-56 demonstrated that spin - orbit misalignments are not confined to hot jupiter systems , which has since also been suggested for the innermost planet of the 55 cancri system based on rossiter - mclaughlin observations ( * ? ? ? * but see also lpez - morales et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "further asteroseismic inclination measurements of exoplanet host stars , which are independent of the properties of planets and hence applicable to a wide range of systems , will reveal whether spin - orbit misalignments in multiplanet systems are common .",
    "high - precision space - based photometry has triggered a revolution in asteroseismology of cool stars over the past few years .",
    "highlights of recent asteroseismic discoveries presented in this review include the study of the internal rotation evolution of red giant stars and the precise characterization of the properties and architectures of exoplanet systems . currently operating and planned space missions such as k2 @xcite , tess @xcite and plato @xcite , as well as ground - based networks such as song @xcite and lcogt @xcite , promise a bright future for asteroseismic studies of cool stars and their planets over the coming decades .                          , k. 2012 , in sf2a-2012 : proceedings of the annual meeting of the french society of astronomy and astrophysics , ed .",
