    "the anomalous or non - fickian diffusive transports have attracted a lot of interest in the past few years .",
    "there is a wide range of heterogeneous or pre - asymptotic systems in the fields of physics , astronomy , biology , chemistry , and economics , where anomalous diffusion occur @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is observed in diffusion on fractal structures in geophysical and geological media @xcite , charge transport in disordered and amorphous semiconductors @xcite , acceleration of particles inside a turbulent medium @xcite , transport process in the biological systems @xcite , and many other examples , for an extensive collection of references see @xcite .",
    "the well - known examples of anomalous diffusions are the continuous time random walk ( sub - diffusive processes ) @xcite and lvy flight @xcite . in this type of processes , the mean square displacement ( msd )",
    "obeys a power law equation with respect to the time with exponent @xmath0 .",
    "anomalous transport , especially the continuous time random walk and lvy flight can be studied within the fractional fokker planck equation approach @xcite .",
    "one of the most important characteristics in normal and anomalous diffusions is the first passage time ( fpt ) , which is defined as the time needed the dynamic variable to cross a given threshold value for the first time @xcite .",
    "the fpt has been used to characterize diffusive processes in various systems such as the spreading of disease @xcite , the passage of polymers and dna in sub - diffusive media and membranes @xcite , the firing of neurons @xcite , animals searching for food @xcite and lvy stable random motion @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting subjects of the diffusion problem is the study of fpt processes in fractal geometries such as percolating fronts , crack patterns , polymer chains , lightening paths , etc @xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in simple fractal objects with fractal dimension @xmath1 without any branch point . since the coordination number of all the points on the fractal is two it is easy to conclude that there should be lots of similarities between fpt processes in these systems and one dimensional systems .",
    "this was already discussed in @xcite and the important rule of the length of the fractal objects in fpt processes were understood . in @xcite",
    "the connection with the schramm loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite were also discussed , especially the important rule of the definition of the length in the sle studies @xcite were emphasized . in this work",
    "we will generalize the work done in @xcite , in many different directions .",
    "to have an idea of fractal objects with fractal dimension @xmath2 we will study the scaling exponents of msd and mean fpt ( mfpt ) of the diffusing particles on loop - erased random walk ( lerw ) , harmonic explorer ( he ) and percolation fronts ( pf ) on the upper half plane",
    ". we will study different random walkers such as fractional brownian motion and subordinated walk on the fractal curves .",
    "the scaling properties of the msd of the walker and mfpt will be discussed .",
    "finally we give a novel method to study diffusion on fractal curves by using sle .",
    "we show that all the scaling behaviors discussed for the discrete fractal curves can be rederived by using subordinated natural sle which is the time changed schramm loewner evolution.the central aim of this work is to use the subordinated natural sle to find a new connection between diffusion on the self similar traces and sle as a growth process .",
    "our analysis of msd and mfpt are the key points of this connection.the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we will fix the notation and introduce the scaling relations for the diffusion problem on semi-1d fractal paths , where we measure the scaling exponents of msd and mfpt , for two sided diffusion and diffusion with waiting times on the self similar curves with fractal dimension @xmath3 . in the third section we use the schramm loewner evolution ( sle ) as a mathematical model to introduce new classes of diffusion processes ( subordinated sle ) .",
    "the results of this section are compatible with the two - sided diffusion and diffusion with the waiting time on the discrete fractal paths . in the last section",
    "we conclude our findings . to be self explanatory we add three appendices explaining the details of our simulation methods .",
    "we begin by considering the diffusion problem on semi-1d random curves . for our purposes",
    "we restrict ourselves to the fractal curves with _ hausdorff _ dimensions @xmath1 @xcite that start from the origin and remain in the upper half - plane . to understand statistical properties of diffusion along such inhomogeneous paths",
    "it is important to first introduce diffusion problem in 1d case .      consider a one - dimensional diffusion @xmath4 with dynamics @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a one dimensional stochastic process .",

    "these special choices force diffusing particle to move only in @xmath9 .",
    "an interesting problem in the theory of stochastic processes is finding the time that a particle reaches a certain level .",
    "the problem of finding this time is called first passage time ( fpt ) @xcite .",
    "the first passage time is the time @xmath10 taken for the process having started from @xmath11 to be reached in @xmath12 @xcite @xmath13 where the infimum for every subset @xmath14 of real numbers is denoted by @xmath15 and is defined to be the biggest real number that is smaller than or equal to every number in @xmath14 .",
    "clearly fpt is a random variable which varies from one sample of @xmath4 to another one . in general",

    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "although studying diffusion in one dimensional systems is interesting for its own sake there are many examples of diffusion in self - similar interfaces with fractal dimensions @xmath1 .",

    "this process is stopped when it reaches a given length . to produce lerw curves started from the origin and conditioned to be in the upper half plane one can use reflecting boundary condition on the real axis for the random walker .",

    "although other studies such as @xcite have also used self similar traces to study the fpt problem they have not characterized the scaling relations in the measurable quantities such as msd and mfpt for the general diffusion processes e.g. two sided diffusion and diffusion with the waiting time which we have studied in our simulations .      in this subsection",
    "we study the statistical properties of the diffusing particles along self - similar curves .",
    "an interesting problem in this direction is the determination of the scaling exponents of the random displacement .",
