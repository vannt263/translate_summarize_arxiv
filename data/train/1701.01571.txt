    "till date , standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is the most appropriate theory to describe the interactions of fundamental particles . despite its enormous successes ,",

    "an unnatural fine tuning is needed to confine the higgs mass within tev scale .",
    "many attempts have been made to address this problem by considering the theories beyond sm of particle physics .",
    "few such candidates are - supersymmetry , technicolor and extra dimensions . among many such attempts @xcite ,",
    "randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite of warped extra dimension earned special attention since it resolves the gauge hierarchy problem without introducing any intermediate scale in the theory .    in rs model ,",
    "two 3-branes are embedded in a five dimensional spacetime compactified on a @xmath1 orbifold .",
    "the distance between these two branes is assumed to be @xmath2 of planck length so that the required hierarchy between the two branes is generated .",
    "one of the crucial aspects of this braneworld scenario is to stabilize the distance between the branes ( known as modulus or radion ) . for this purpose , it is necessary to generate an appropriate radion potential with a stable minimum consistent with the value proposed in rs model in order to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "goldberger and wise ( gw ) proposed a mechanism @xcite to create such a radion potential by introducing a bulk scalar field with appropriate boundary values .",
    "subsequently the phenomenology of radion field has also been studied extensively .",
    "this radion phenomenology @xcite along with the study of rs graviton @xcite and rs black holes @xcite are considered as key signatures to look for warped extra dimension in collider experiments in lhc @xcite .",
    "it is well known that einstein - hilbert action can be generalized by adding higher order curvature terms which naturally arise from diffeomorphism property of the action .",
    "such terms also have their origin in string theory due to quantum corrections .",
    "@xmath3 @xcite , gauss - bonnet ( gb ) @xcite or more generally lanczos - lovelock gravity are some of the candidates in higher curvature gravitational theory .",
    "higher curvature terms become extremely relevant at the regime of large curvature .",
    "thus for rs bulk geometry where the curvature is of the order of planck scale , the higher curvature terms should play a crucial role .",
    "motivated by this idea , in the present work , we consider a generalized rs model by replacing einstein - hilbert bulk gravity action with a higher curvature gravitational theory .",
    "moreover we choose @xmath3 model to represent the higher curvature theory due to the reason that any @xmath3 model can be mapped to scalar - tensor theory at the action level by a conformal transformation of the metric @xcite and for the purpose of modulus stabilization what one needs is a scalar field @xcite .",
    "however the important questions that remain are :    1 .   is the rs braneworld modified by @xmath3 gravity , stabilized even without introducing an external stabilizing field ? 2 .",
    "if the modified braneworld scenario is stabilized , then how the radion mass and coupling parameters will change from that of rs scenario due to the presence of higher order curvature terms ?",
    "we aim to address these questions in this work by using the equivalence between @xmath3 and scalar - tensor theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : following two sections are devoted to brief reviews of rs scenario and conformal relationship between @xmath3 and scalar - tensor ( st ) theory . in section iv , we extend our analysis of section iii for the specific @xmath3 model considered in this work .",

    "the opposite brane tensions along with the finely tuned five dimensional cosmological constant serve as energy - momentum tensor of rs scenario .",

    "all the dimensionful parameters described above are related to the reduced 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath15 as , @xmath16    in order to solve the hierarchy problem , it is assumed in rs scenario that the branes are separated by such a distance that @xmath17 . then the exponential factor present in the metric , which is often called warp factor , produces a large suppression so that a mass scale of the order of planck scale is reduced to tev scale on the visible brane .",
    "a scalar mass say mass of higgs is given as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are physical and bare higgs mass respectively .",

    "consequently the phenomenology of the radion field originating from 5d gravitational degrees of freedom has also been explored @xcite .",

    "moreover for @xmath112 , @xmath56 becomes negative which in turn makes the modulus @xmath106 negative ( see eqn.([stabilized.modulus.f(r ) ] ) ) , an unphysical situation . from the above two statements , it is clear that the self stabilization in @xmath3 model arises entirely due to the presence of higher curvature term @xmath113 only when @xmath54 .    from the above relation ( eqn.([stabilized.modulus.f(r ) ] ) ) and using the expression of @xmath56 ( eqn.([mass_phi ] ) ) , we obtain the figure [ plot alpha vs brane separation ] between @xmath114 and @xmath115 .     vs @xmath115,width=336,height=192 ]    the figure demonstrates that the brane separation ( @xmath106 ) increases with the higher curvature parameter @xmath43 .      a fluctuation of branes around the stable configuration @xmath106 is now considered .",

    "the action contains only the linear term in ricci scalar and the factor @xmath120 goes to @xmath121 which agrees with @xcite . with the redefined field ,",
    "kinetic part of radion field becomes , @xmath122 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d^4x ( \\partial_{\\mu}\\psi ) ( \\partial^{\\mu}\\psi )   \\nonumber\\\\\\ ] ] finally the kaluza - klein reduction leads to the potential part of radion field as follows , @xmath123 ^ 2   \\label{potential.radion.f(r)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it may be observed that @xmath124 goes to zero as @xmath43 tends to zero .",
    "this is expected because for @xmath111 , the action contains only the einstein part which does not produce any potential term for the radion field @xcite .",
    "thus for five dimensional warped geometric model , the radion potential is generated from the higher order curvature term @xmath113 .",
    "the potential in eqn.([potential.radion.f(r ) ] ) has a vev at @xmath125^{-1/\\epsilon }   \\label{vev.radion.f(r)}\\ ] ] which leads to the inter - brane separation as , @xmath126   \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the leading order of @xmath109 .",
    "this above equation exactly resembles with the eqn.([stabilized.modulus.f(r ) ] ) which again indicates that the five dimensional warped spacetime we considered , is self stabilized by higher curvature gravitational theory .",
    "we emphasize that due to the presence of conformal factor connecting the two theories , the value of @xmath114 ( in @xmath3 model ) is less than @xmath95 ( in st model ) .",
    "however we find that the stabilization of modulus remain intact in both the models .",
    "finally the squared mass of radion field is as follows , @xmath127 [ \\frac{v_h}{v_v } - 1]^2   \\label{radion.mass.f(r)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is noticed that the mass of radion field is enhanced by the higher curvature terms in five dimensional gravitational action .",
    "the radion field arises as a scalar degree of freedom on the tev brane and has interactions with the standard model ( sm ) fields . from the five dimensional metric ( eqn.([grav.sol2.f(r ) ] ) ) , it is clear that the induced metric on visible brane is @xmath128 ( where @xmath119 $ ] ) and consequently @xmath129 couples directly with sm fields .",
    "+ for example , consider the higgs sector of standard model , @xmath130     \\nonumber\\\\    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the higgs field . in order to get a canonical kinetic term , one needs to redefine @xmath132 .",
    "therefore for @xmath133 , the above action can be written as , @xmath134     \\label{higgs action }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath135 . considering a fluctuation of @xmath129 about its vev as @xmath136",
    ", one can obtain ( from eqn.([higgs action ] ) ) that @xmath137 couples to @xmath133 through the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the higgs field : @xmath138 so , the coupling between radion and higgs field become , @xmath139 .",
    "similar consideration holds for any other sm fields . for example for @xmath96 boson , the corresponding coupling is @xmath140 .",
    "thus the inverse of @xmath141 plays a crucial role in determining the coupling strength between radion and sm fields . in the present case ,",

    "we see that the coupling between radion and sm fields is suppressed due to the presence of higher curvature parameter @xmath43 which in turn modifies the phenomenology on visible 3-brane .",
    "in this work , we consider a five dimensional ads , compactified warped geometry model with two 3-branes embedded within the spacetime . due to large curvature ( @xmath2 planck scale ) in the bulk , the spacetime is considered to be governed by higher curvature like @xmath0 . in this scenario ,",
    "we address how the modulus stabilization and radion phenomenology are affected by higher curvature terms .",
    "the findings and implications of our results are as follows :    * the model comes as a self stabilizing system due to the presence of higher curvature term @xmath113 .",
    "the additional degree of freedom originated from the higher curvature term plays the role of a stabilizing field . for @xmath111 , the stabilization condition ( eqn.([stabilized.modulus.f(r ) ] ) ) leads the brane separation to be zero .",
    "* we scan the parametric space of @xmath43 for which the modulus is going to be stabilized .",
    "our result reveals that for @xmath112 , the inter - brane separation becomes negative which is an unphysical situation .",
    "thus the braneworld we considered is stabilized only when @xmath54 .",
    "this condition constrains the @xmath3 model itself",
    ". moreover the distance between the branes increases with the parameter @xmath43 which is clear from figure ( [ plot alpha vs brane separation ] ) . *",
    "quadratic term in curvature also generates the radion potential with a stable minimum .",
    "we find the radion mass as well as radion coupling with sm fields .",
    "the expressions of mass ( eqn.([radion.mass.f(r ) ] ) ) and coupling ( eqn.([coupling 1 ] ) and eqn.([coupling 2 ] ) ) clearly indicate that the mass is enhanced while the coupling is suppressed over the scenario where only einstein gravity is concerned @xcite .",
    "thus the cross section between radion and sm fields is overall suppressed due to the presence of higher order curvature terms in five dimensional gravitational action .",
