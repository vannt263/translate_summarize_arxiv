    "together with the development of photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) , a large amount of research has been devoted to investigate the possibilities of infiltrating the air holes of a pcf with different liquids@xcite , and thereby changing the optical properties of the fiber .",
    "depending on the refractive index of the liquid , the guiding effect of the fiber can possibly be changed from guiding based on modified total internal reflection ( mtir ) , to guiding based on the photonic band gap effect , where the core has a lower refractive index than the effective index of the cladding . also selective",
    "filling of pcfs , where only some of the holes are infiltrated , has experienced a considerable interest@xcite , because this can be used to tailor the optical characteristics of the pcf . among the various liquids that can be infiltrated in a pcf , liquid crystals ( lc )",
    "distinguishes themselves , because of their anisotropic nature , which allows the possibility of controlling the optical parameters of the waveguide by changing the orientation of the molecules@xcite",
    ". this orientation can be controlled in different ways , for example by applying an electric field externally .",
    "the optical characteristics of the fiber can also be changed by varying the temperature , since the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices of lcs are highly dependent on temperature .",
    "recently these tunable properties of lcs have been used in various experimental research projects@xcite .",
    "+ the lc can be infiltrated in the pcf using various techniques , one possibility is to use a pressure chamber , but this technique has shown to introduce orientational irregularities in the alignment of lc molecules@xcite . another possibility is to infiltrate the holes of the pcf using capillary forces , this technique has shown to give a regular alignment of the lc molecules .",
    "a disadvantage using capillary forces for the infiltration is that the length of the infiltrated region will only be of the order of a few centimeters , while longer infiltration lengths can be achieved using pressure infiltration .",
    "+ in the present work we address the problem of calculating chromatic dispersion curves for different waveguide designs , where the material dispersion of both the lc and waveguide material is taken into account .",
    "the lc infiltrated pcf structures we consider have previously been studied theoretically@xcite , without inclusion of material dispersion in the pcf material and lc , and only considering the special case where the extraordinary index of the lc and the index of the pcf material were identical .",
    "the material dispersion of lc is important to take into account , since lcs are highly dispersive , especially in the visible spectrum , where the dispersion can be much stronger than in for example silica .",
    "it has previously been shown that approximating the total dispersion simply by adding the waveguide and material dispersion gives the correct qualitative behavior of the dispersion curve@xcite , but is not sufficient if quantitative data for the dispersion is needed , for example to determine the position of zero dispersion wavelengths ( zdws ) .",
    "+ to calculate precise dispersion profiles , we must therefore include the material dispersion in the field equations .",
    "this destroys the well known scalability of maxwells equations , hence if all the physical dimensions of the fiber are multiplied by a constant factor , we are not able to calculate the new dispersion curve without having to solve the field equations again . in addition , if the computational method used to find the eigenmodes numerically takes the propagation constant as an input variable , and returns the corresponding frequency , we must ensure that this is done in a self - consistent manner , i.e. the values of the dielectric constants in the numerical calculation must correspond to the values of the dielectric constants at the frequency returned by the computational method .",
    "+ in this work we find the self - consistent frequencies based on a generalization of a perturbative method developed for isotropic waveguides@xcite .",
    "we consider dispersion profiles of both simple waveguides consisting of capillary silica tubes infiltrated with lcs , and more advanced selectively filled pcf structures .",
    "finally we investigate how a change in temperature affects the dispersion characteristics of the fiber .",
    "in all the fiber designs considered in this work the lc is contained inside a hollow circular cylinder . it is well known that an intense optical field will interact with the lc and change the orientation of the molecules@xcite , here we assume that the intensity of the optical field is so weak that we can neglect this interaction .",
    "the lc is assumed to be in the nematic phase , where the orientation of the molecules is correlated , resulting in a preferred local orientation of the molecules .",
    "this local orientation is described by the director axis @xmath0 which is a unit vector pointing in the same direction as the axis of the lc - molecules . in the general case @xmath0",
    "is found by minimization of elastic energy .",
    "for the cylindrical geometry considered here the director axis has the following form @xmath1 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 .",

    "order nonlinear ordinary differential equation , where the only parameters are the elastic constants of the lc .",
    "we assume that the molecules along @xmath7 are aligned parallel to the @xmath5-axis ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the boundary condition at the cylinder wall depends on the lc and the coating of the capillary .",
    "here we consider the two different possibilities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "the dielectric tensor of a nematic lc is described in terms of the perpendicular and parallel part of the optical permittivity @xmath12 and @xmath13 . if the orientation of the molecules is described by the angle @xmath6 , then the dielectric tensor has the following form in cylindrical coordinates@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
