    "one starting point for the theoretical investigation of the behavior of random magnets and related systems is to consider the system as consisting of finite ordered regions , called clusters , domains or droplets . in this article",
    "we want to consider the case of highly disordered systems where the magnetic structure consists of fractal domains with domain sizes on a broad range of length scales and we will derive a simple theoretical description based on scaling ideas .",
    "nearly all of the assumptions we make and scaling relations we use will be proven in detail by exact ground state calculations as well as by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the system we consider is the 2d diluted ising antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field ( daff ) which can be used to study typical behavior of strongly disordered systems as there are metastability , slow dynamics , and domain structures @xcite .",
    "related systems like random - field systems which are thought to be in the same universality class like the daff @xcite or spin glasses may behave similar .",
    "the hamiltonian of the daff in units of the next - neighbor coupling constant @xmath0 reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 denote ising - spins and @xmath3 a quenched disorder .",
    "the phase diagram of the 2d daff consists of an antiferromagnetic low temperature phase for magnetic field @xmath4 and a disordered phase for all finite values of @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , in three dimensions there exists a long - range ordered phase also for small magnetic fields @xcite . for higher fields and low temperatures the daff develops a disordered domain state , both in two and three dimensions .",
    "this domain state has many of the characteristics of a spin glass , as for instance a remanent magnetisation and an irreversibility line scaling like the dealmeida - thouless line @xcite . for large disorder",
    "the domains have been shown to have a fractal structure @xcite with a broad distribution of domain sizes and with scaling laws strongly deviating from the usual imry - ma assumptions @xcite which are thought to be correct in the limit of small disorder .",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the 2d daff during relaxation from a long - range ordered system to the fractal - domain state and describe this process in terms of a certain growth process dominated by thermal activation . in order to prove this approach in detail we use two numerical techniques to investigate 2d systems with a size of @xmath6 on a square lattice and a dilution of 30% .    in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite we use the standard heat - bath algorithm .",
    "due to the slow dynamics of the daff at low temperatures it is extremely difficult to investigate equilibrium properties using mc techniques .",
    "therefore , additionally we calculate the highly non - trivial ground states of the daff exactly using methods known from graph theory @xcite .",
    "the ising system is mapped on a graph and the maximum flow through the graph is determined by the ford - fulkerson algorithm @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two methods , mc simulation and exact ground state ( egs ) calculation , allows a precise investigation of both dynamics and equilibrium properties at finite temperatures and at @xmath7 .",
    "the geometrical properties of domains in random magnets are important as a starting point for theoretical considerations as well as for the interpretation of experimental results . in order to investigate the structure of the domain state of a simulated daff we perform a cluster analysis with a suitable adjusted hoshen - kopelman type algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm pieces the system into domains .",
    "a domain is uniquely defined as a group of spins which are connected and antiferromagnetically ordered . in this way , it is possible to compute directly the volume @xmath8 ( number of spins ) , surface @xmath9 ( number of unsatisfied bonds ) and radius @xmath10 ( root of the mean squared distance of spins ) of the domains formed ( note that in two dimensions @xmath8 is the area and @xmath9 the border of the domains ) . also one can compute the corresponding energy - relevant quantities , like domain wall energy @xmath11 ( number of broken bonds ) and volume - magnetization @xmath12 for all domains .",
    "the fractal properties of the domain state calculated by mc simulation have been reported earlier @xcite . for high disorder we discovered a fractal and interpenetrating structure of the domains fulfilling scaling relations which are strongly deviating from the assumptions of the imry - ma argument @xcite .",
    "these earlier findings are also correct for the egs reported here for the first time for the 2d daff . fig .",
    "[ mv ] shows the volume - magnetisation @xmath13 , i. e. the mean volume - magnetisation @xmath14 of domains with size @xmath8 . the scaling behavior is identical with that for the domains calculated by mc simulation  which are inevitably out of equilibrium . for 3d systems",
    "this has been shown earlier @xcite . as fig .",
    "[ mv ] shows the scaling relation @xmath15 holds for large enough @xmath8 .",
    "all scaling relations of the daff obtained so far are summarized in table [ table ] .",
    "an important quantity is the distribution of domain sizes found in the domain state of the 2d daff . in the next section",
    "we will use this distribution function for a description of the dynamics of the daff .",
    "[ nv ] shows the number of domains @xmath16 for a given volume @xmath8 from egs calculations .",
    "since the number of domains is a strongly fluctuating quantity the data are averaged over intervals of volumes @xmath17 .",
    "the width of these intervals is increased exponentially so that we have a constant distance between points on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the data are well described by a power - law with an exponential cut - off , @xmath18 the lines in fig .",
    "[ nv ] are fits to eq .",
    "the cut - off parameter @xmath19 is field dependent . although the fractal dimensions of the domains of the daff are the same as those known from percolation @xcite the exponent @xmath20 is between that for critical percolation clusters ( @xmath21 ) and that for lattice animals ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a possible small field dependence of this exponent can not be ruled out . also , the isolated clusters from the percolation problem lead to the systematic deviation from the power law in fig .",
    "[ nv ] for very small volumes @xmath23 .",
    "since there is no infinite domain in the system we do not consider a streched exponential cut - off in eq .",
    "[ e.nv ] ( the latter is known from the percolation problem if there is an infinite cluster ) . summed up",
    ", the domains of the daff have the structure of the lattice animals of the percolation problem but with a different exponent @xmath24 in the distribution function .    the distribution function eq .  [ e.nv ]",
    "is a central quantity of a domain state since other quantities follow from this distribution .",
    "e. g. the order parameter @xmath25 per spin can be rewritten as the sum over all domain sizes @xmath8 of the corresponding order parameters times the number of domains of that size , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distribution of domain sizes normalized in such a way that @xmath25 is the staggered magnetisation per spin .    in the next section",
    "we will use the equations above as the starting point for a description of the dynamics of the daff .",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the two - dimensional daff . as was discussed in the preceeding section the equilibrium state of the system in a finite field consists of",
    "antiferromagnetically ordered domains with a size distribution following eq .",
    "[ e.nv ] . when we start the dynamics with an antiferromagnetically long - range ordered system how does the system evolve into this fractal - domain state ?",
    "[ picture ] shows a ground state configuration from egs calculations ( bottom ) and two configurations of the same system ( i.  e. with same configuration of vacancies ) during the mc simulation . for these pictures",
    "we restrict ourselves to a small system of size @xmath28 .",
    "we start the simulation with a long - range ordered state ( white ) and switch on a field @xmath29 and a finite temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the ground state of our system is essentially unique ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "it is a domain pattern that is stored in the system through the vacancy configuration and the field and it is the equilibrium state of the system .",
    "how is this domain pattern reconstructed in our monte carlo simulation ?    as fig .",
    "[ picture ] suggests , during the relaxation from the long - range ordered initial state to the fractal - domain state the dynamics of the system can be understood as a kind of growth process . for shorter times",
    "only small domains arise .",
    "interestingly , these small domains are located at those places where later the larger domains will be . at later times , _ also _ larger domains occur and the size of the largest domains increases in time .",
    "the pictures lead us to the following description of the growth process : the equilibrium distribution of domains develops starting with the smaller domains and increasing the maximum domain size in time .    in order to investigate this process quantitatively",
    "we simulate the size distribution of domains during the relaxation process .",
    "[ nv_dyn ] shows the equilibrium distribution from egs calculations and distributions of domains that are reversed after five different times of mc simulation . for a given time",
    "@xmath31 the system has obviously a distribution that is equal to the equilibrium distribution @xmath27 corresponding to eq.[e.nv ] up to the largest domain size @xmath32 that has developed at that time by thermal activation .",
    "note that this time dependent cut - off in the distribution function is very abrupt since fig .",
    "[ nv_dyn ] shows data over a range of eight decades .",
    "these considerations lead to the following description of the time development of the order parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we start with a long - range ordered system , i. e. @xmath33 . since due to the dilution there are spins or clusters of spins that are not or only weakly connected to the infinite cluster .",
    "these clusters may have finite magnetisations which follow the external field immediately since there are no relevant energy barriers . ] after switching on the field the staggered magnetisation decreases to @xmath34 ( except of finite - size effects ) due to the growth of domains of the other phase : @xmath35    since a domain is defined as a group of spins which are antiferromagnetically ordered it is per definition @xmath36 for the reversed domains so that @xmath37 where the last line defines the function @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is defined by the normalisation condition @xmath40 according to the preceeding section the exponent is @xmath41 and the field dependent cut - off parameter can be obtained from egs calculations .",
    "thus @xmath38 is well defined without any unknown parameters .",
    "since the integration can not be done exactly it will be calculated numerically .",
    "furthermore , the integral @xmath38 is related to the so - called incomplete gamma - function @xmath42 the properties of which we will discuss later .",
    "it is highly plausible that the largest existing domain size @xmath32 for a time @xmath31 is connected to a thermal activation energy @xmath43 according to @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an exponent connecting the size of domains with a free - energy barrier @xmath46 which has to be overcome during the build - up of a domain of size @xmath47 .",
    "this assumption of thermal activation gives the time dependence of @xmath25 in eq.[e.gamma ] .    in order to prove the validity of our approach we use mc simulation data for the decay of the order parameter . in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] we show data for three different values of the magnetic field @xmath48 .",
    "the way we evaluate the simulation data is the following :    \\i ) first of all , due to the equations above data for the relaxation for different temperatures should collapse in a scaling plot @xmath25 versus any function @xmath49 where @xmath50 should be a microscopic time scale for the growth of the smallest domains .",
    "[ gamma ] the data for four ( @xmath51 ) respectively three ( @xmath52 ) different temperatures and a time window ranging from 95 mcs to 200000 mcs are seen to collapse very well using @xmath53 mcs .",
    "we do not consider time scales much shorter than 100 mcs because then thermal fluctuations can not be neglected .",
    "\\ii ) finding the correct barrier exponent @xmath45 and the prefactor @xmath54 we can determine @xmath55 and following eq .",
    "[ e.gamma ] the data for @xmath56 should be described by @xmath38 . as fig .",
    "[ gamma ] shows this works perfectly for the complete range of the scaling variable @xmath8 and for three different fields using @xmath57 .",
    "note that the reason for the field dependence of @xmath38 is the field dependence of the cut - off parameter @xmath19 which has been obtained by egs calculations ( see fig .  [ nv ] ) .    the data for the two higher fields are less accurate since in this case the dynamics is faster and has a shorter observation time .",
    "additionally for the higher fields we restricted ourselves to smaller lattices ( @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 for @xmath51 ) since the egs calculations are very time consuming .",
    "however , no field dependence of the barrier exponent can be seen .",
    "the prefactor @xmath54 is slightly field dependent ( @xmath60 .",
    "note that since the barrier exponent is very small we are close to the case @xmath61 which is the limit @xmath62 in eq .",
    "[ e.ar ] .    of course",
    ", other quantities can be described in a similar manner .",
    "e. g. for large enough volumes @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ mv ] ) the magnetisation @xmath63 can be written correspondingly as @xmath64 the magnetisation @xmath63 is a quantity that can be measured experimentally .",
    "its precise behavior has to be obtained from a numerical integration of eq .",
    "two for the description of experimental data relevant limits can however be obtained asymptotically as limits of the gamma - function .",
    "the first limit is that of short times and small temperatures where the exponential cut - off is irrelevant which means @xmath65 and consequently @xmath66 resulting in @xmath67 this is a logarithmic law with a temperature - independent exponent obtained from the fractality and the distribution of the equilibrium domains and from the free - energy barriers that have to be overcome to build up these domains .",
    "similar logarithmic laws are usually used to describe experimental data of the dynamics of the daff ( for a review of the experimental work see @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath68 is not zero but has a small finite value for the same reason that has been explained earlier  see the discussion of @xmath69 .",
    "the second limit is that close to equilibrium , i. e. for long times and higher temperatures .",
    "here we can use an asymptotic form of the gamma - function @xmath70 the restriction to the most relevant term  the e - function  results in @xmath71 the generalized power law eq .  [ e.gp ] has been used to fit experimental data as well as data from mc simulations for the remanent magnetisation of the 3d daff @xcite . for @xmath72 it simplifies to a simple power law with the exponent proportional to the temperature .",
    "this law has also been discussed as a description of the remanent magnetisation of the 3d daff @xcite and it is typical for the decay of the remanent magnetisation of spin glasses ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we derived a simple description for the dynamics of the 2d daff during the relaxation from long - range order to a fractal - domain state .",
    "the basic fundaments of this description are the fractality and the distribution of the domains the domain state of the system consists of in the limit of high disorder .",
    "this is the main extension to earlier theories for the case of weak disorder based on scaling assumptions for domains which are compact and non - fractal with for a certain time scale unique relevant length scale  the domain radius ( see e. g. @xcite for scaling theories of random - field models and @xcite for a description of domain dynamics in terms of domain wall motion ) .    as a result of our approach which is based on measured quantities of the domain state the dynamics",
    "can be described with the assumption of thermal activation analytically and is given by an incomplete gamma - function .",
    "as one advantage this function connects naturally two for disordered systems often observed laws as limiting cases  the logarithmic law in the limit of short times and low temperatures and the ( generalized ) power law in the limit of late times and higher temperatures .",
    "apart from that our approach illustrates that from the fact that a system has a distribution of domain sizes instead of one dominating size follows that the mean domain size of that distribution can grow following a power law ( eq .  [ e.pl ] ) even if the largest domain in the system is build by thermal activation , i. e. within a logarithmic time scale ( see e. g. @xcite for a summary of this apparent contradiction in spin glasses ) .",
    "the agreement with simulations is excellent .",
    "however , so far we are not aware of any direct experimental observation of this kind of dynamics in 2d daff although as mentioned above similar laws are often observed in the dynamics of disordered magnets and we assume that a similar description might also work for other strongly disordered systems like random - field systems or spin glasses .",
