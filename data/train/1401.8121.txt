    "the recent measurements @xcite-@xcite regarding the neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 have undoubtedly improved our knowledge of neutrino oscillation phenomenology .",
    "interestingly , this @xmath0 value which is unexpectedly ` large ' , being almost near the cabibbo angle , would have important implications for flavor physics .",
    "also , it may be mentioned that before the measurement of @xmath0 , assuming it to be zero or nearly equal to zero and considering the canonical values of the other two neutrino mixing angles , the effort was to discover some underlying symmetry @xcite in the leptonic sector .",
    "the non zero value of @xmath0 leads to parallelism between the mixings of quarks and leptons as well as signifies the difference between the mixing angles of quarks and leptons as the leptonic mixing angles are large compared with the corresponding quark mixing angles .",
    "ever since the observations regarding @xmath0 there has been a good deal of activity on the theoretical front in understanding the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "noting that there is a similarity between quark and lepton mixing phenomena @xcite , it becomes desirable to understand these from the same perspective as far as possible .",
    "however , there are some important differences which have to be kept in mind before considering a unified framework for formulating quark and lepton mass matrices on the same footing . for example",
    ", one may note that unlike the case of quark mixings which show a hierarchical structure , the pattern of neutrino mixings do not show any explicit hierarchy .",
    "further , at present there is no consensus about neutrino masses which may show normal / inverted hierarchy or may even be degenerate .",
    "furthermore , the situation becomes complicated when one realizes that it is yet not clear whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles .",
    "it may be mentioned that in the absence of any viable theory for flavor physics , one usually resorts to phenomenological models . in this context , texture",
    "specific mass matrices have got good deal of attention in the literature , for details and extensive references we refer the readers to a recent review article @xcite .",
    "in particular , fritzsch - like texture specific mass matrices seem to be very helpful in understanding the pattern of quark mixings and cp violation @xcite . keeping in mind quark lepton parallelism @xcite and taking clue from the success of these texture specific mass matrices in the context of quarks",
    ", several attempts @xcite have also been made to consider similar lepton mass matrices . however , noting the above mentioned complexities of neutrino masses and mixings , it seems necessary to carry out a detailed and case by case analysis of texture specific mass matrices for their compatibility with the mixing data .",
    "in particular , for any given texture , the analysis needs to be carried out for all the neutrino mass hierarchies as well as for both majorana and dirac neutrinos since the latter have not yet been ruled out experimentally @xcite .",
    "considering neutrinos to be majorana particles , after the recent measurements of @xmath0 , a few analyses have been carried out for texture specific mass matrices in the non flavor basis .",
    "in particular , fukugita _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated the implications of angle @xmath0 on minimal texture mass matrices ( fritzsch - like texture 6 zero ) for normal hierarchy of masses .",
    "this analysis has been extended further by fakay _",
    "_ @xcite wherein for all the hierarchies of neutrino masses , texture 6 and 5 zero mass matrices have been examined in detail . for the case of dirac neutrinos , although several authors have examined the possibility of these having small masses @xcite as well as their compatibility with the supersymmetric guts @xcite , however , similar attempts have not yet been carried out after the measurements of @xmath0 . in this context , it may be added that the original texture 6 zero fritzsch mass matrices have been ruled out in the case of quarks , therefore , in the light of similarity between the mixing patterns of quarks and leptons , it becomes desirable to examine similar mass matrices for the cases of neutrinos .    in the present paper , for the case of dirac neutrinos ,",
    "we have carried out detailed calculations pertaining to mass matrices with minimal texture for the three possibilities of neutrino masses having normal / inverted hierarchy or being degenerate . in particular , the analysis has been carried out by imposing fritzsch - like texture 6 zero structure on dirac neutrino mass matrices as well as on charged lepton mass matrices .",
    "the compatibility of these texture specific mass matrices have been examined by plotting the parameter space corresponding to the recently measured mixing angle @xmath1 along with the other two mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "further , for the normal hierarchy case , the implications of mixing angles on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath4 have also been investigated .",
    "the detailed plan of the paper is as follows . to set notations and conventions as well as to make the paper self contained , in section ( [ form ] ) we present some of the essentials regarding texture 6 zero dirac neutrino mass matrices .",
    "inputs used in the present analysis have been given in section ( [ in ] ) .",
    "the analysis pertaining to inverted , normal hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses have been respectively presented in sections ( [ inv ] ) , ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ deg ] ) .",
    "finally , section ( [ summ ] ) summarizes our conclusions .",

    "any general mass matrix m can be expressed as m = hu , where h denotes a hermitian and u a unitary matrix . in the present case",
    ", the matrix u can be absorbed by redefining the right handed singlet neutrino fields , therefore , enabling one to bring down the number of free parameters from 36 to 18 , which are further brought down by considering textures , discussed below .",
    "after defining the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , their texture 6 zero fritzsch structures are given as [ frmm6 ] m_l= ( 0 & a _ l & 0 + a_l^ * & 0 & b_l + 0 & b_l^ * & c_l ) , m_d= ( 0 & a _ & 0 + a_^ * & 0 & b _ + 0 & b_^ * & c _ ) , @xmath11 and @xmath7 respectively corresponding to charged lepton and dirac neutrino mass matrices .",

    "for the inverted hierarchy case also we have taken the same range for the lightest neutrino mass corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "it may be mentioned that our conclusions remain unaffected even if the range is extended further . in the absence of any constraint on the phases , @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "have been given full variation from 0 to @xmath58 .",
    "to examine the compatibility of texture 6 zero dirac neutrino mass matrices with the recent mixing data , we first discuss the implications of mixing angle @xmath0 for the case pertaining to inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "to this end , in figures [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) we present the plots of the parameter space corresponding to @xmath1 along with the other two mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . giving full allowed variation to other parameters , figure [ fig1](a ) has been obtained by constraining the angle @xmath3 by its experimental bound given in equation ( [ angles2 ] ) and similarly while plotting figure [ fig1](b ) the angle @xmath2 has been constrained by its experimental limits .",

    "range of this angle .",
    "interestingly , from this figure one can conclude that not only the @xmath61 c.l .",
    "range of @xmath3 again confirms the ruling out of this case of texture 6 zero mass matrices , but also corresponding to the @xmath59 c.l .",
    "range of this angle , one finds that again the ruling out is largely confirmed .",
    "it may be added in case we plot a graph of angle @xmath2 versus @xmath4 , it indicates towards compatibility of these mass matrices with the data .",
    "however , it needs to be noted that to rule out the matrices it is sufficient to do so from any one of the mixing angle versus the mass @xmath4 graph .",
    "the degenerate scenario of neutrino masses can be characterized by either @xmath63 or @xmath64 corresponding to normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy respectively . as mentioned earlier , the diagonalizing transformations for the above two cases are respectively the same as the ones obtained for normal hierarchy of masses , equation ( [ nhelement ] ) and for inverted hierarchy of masses , equation ( [ ihelement ] ) .",
    "therefore , the conclusions regarding the texture 6 zero dirac neutrino mass matrices corresponding to both normal and inverted hierarchy remain valid for this case also .    this can be understood from figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "while plotting figures [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) the range of the lightest neutrino mass is taken to be @xmath56 , which includes the neutrino masses corresponding to degenerate scenario , therefore by discussion similar to the one given for ruling out texture specific mass matrices for inverted hierarchy , these are ruled out for degenerate scenario of neutrino masses as well .",
    "similarly , for degenerate scenario corresponding to normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , figure [ fig2](b ) clearly shows that the values of @xmath3 corresponding to @xmath65 lie outside the experimentally allowed range , thereby ruling out the mass matrices for degenerate scenario .",
    "to summarize , for dirac neutrinos , we have carried out detailed calculations pertaining to minimal texture characterized by texture 6 zero fritzsch - like mass matrices .",
    "corresponding to these , we have considered neutrino masses having normal , inverted hierarchy as well as degenerate scenario .",
    "the compatibility of these texture specific mass matrices have been examined by plotting the parameter space corresponding to the recently measured mixing angle @xmath1 along with the other two mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "further , for the normal hierarchy case , the implications of mixing angles on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath4 have also been investigated .",
    "interestingly , the analysis reveals that using @xmath66 c.l.inputs , all the texture 6 zero cases of dirac neutrino mass matrices pertaining to normal , inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of the neutrino masses seem to be completely ruled out , for @xmath67 c.l .",
