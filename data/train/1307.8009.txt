    "precision measurements are important across all fields of science and technology . by employing quantum features like entanglement and squeezing , quantum metrology promises enhancing precision and",
    "has drawn a lot of attention in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "quantum metrology deals with the ultimate precision limits in estimation procedures , taking into account the constraints imposed by quantum mechanics , and allows one to gain advantages over purely classical approaches  @xcite . as a key component of the quantum metrology theory , quantum parameter estimation",
    "has many applications in experiments , such as the detection of gravitational radiation  @xcite , quantum frequency standards  @xcite , clock synchronization  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "quantum fisher information ( qfi ) is another significant concept in quantum metrology and has been studied widely  @xcite . as an extension of the classical fisher information in statistics and information theory ,",
    "qfi plays a paramount role in quantum estimation theory . in quantum metrology theory ,",
    "these two concepts are linked by the quantum cramr - rao inequality  @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the variance of an unbiased estimator @xmath3 of a parameter @xmath4 , @xmath5 represents the number of repeated experiments and @xmath6 is the qfi of the parameter .",
    "the inverse of the qfi provides the lower bound of the error of the estimation .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a fundamental parameter estimation task in which the parameter @xmath4 is generated by some unitary dynamics @xmath7 .",
    "this kind of parameter estimation task is common in many experimental setups such as mach - zehnder interferometers and ramsey interferometers .",
    "based on a recent expression of qfi @xcite , we show that the qfi of @xmath4 for a unitary parameterized dynamics is the mean variance of @xmath8 over the eigenstates minus the transition terms of @xmath8 .",
    "next we take a two dimension case as our interest .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a general @xmath9 density matrix have been given in terms of its determinant , difference between diagonal elements and phase of off - diagonal elements .",
    "for integrity we also give the eigenvalues and eigenstates for a density operator on a nonorthogonal basis of two dimensions .",
    "while exact results and analytical solutions are known for noiseless situations , the determination of the ultimate precision limit in the presence of noise is still a challenging problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "recently , j. joo @xmath10studied the entangled coherent states in a mach - zehnder interferometer under perfect and lossy conditions @xcite .",
    "they found the entangled coherent states ( ecs ) can reach better precision in comparison to n00n , `` bat '' , and `` optimal '' states in both conditions .",
    "in lossy conditions , they modeled the particle loss by fictitious beam splitters and adopted a numeric strategy to calculate the qfi of the ecs . utilizing our formula we give an analytic expression of the qfi .",
    "we find that even in a lossy condition , the ecs can still surpass the heisenberg limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the qfi and obtain an explicit formula of the qfi for a family of density matrices parameterized through a unitary dynamics . in sec .",
    "iii , we give the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a 2-dimensional density matrix in terms of its determinant , difference between diagonal elements and phase of off - diagonal elements .",
    "we also generalize the eigen problem in a nonorthogonal basis .",
    "afterward , in sec .",
    "iv , we apply our result to the ecs in a lossy mach - zehnder interferometer and get an analytical expression of the qfi .",
    "finally , the conclusion is given in sec . v.",
    "in this section , we briefly review the calculation of the qfi . for a parameterized quantum states",
    "@xmath11 , a widely used version of qfi @xmath12 is defined as @xcite @xmath13 where the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) operator @xmath14 is determined by @xmath15.\\label{eq : sld}\\ ] ]    consider a density operator @xmath11 on a @xmath16-dimensional system ( @xmath16 can be infinite ) .",
    "the corresponding spectrum decomposition is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the eigenvalue and @xmath19 is the eigenstate , and @xmath20 implying that there are @xmath21 zero eigenvalues . with the decomposition of the density matrix one",
    "can directly obtain the element of the sld operator from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sld ] ) as @xmath22 notice that the matrix element of @xmath14 is not defined when @xmath23 .",
    "it turns out that the qfi is completely determined in the support of @xmath11 , that is , the space spanned by those eigenvectors corresponding to the nonvanishing eigenvalues .",
    "it can be expressed as @xcite @xmath24    for the special case of a pure state ( @xmath25 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfi1 ] ) reduces to @xmath26.\\ ] ] using this form of the qfi for pure states , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfi1 ] ) as    @xmath27    it is clear that the first term can be regarded as the classical contribution  @xcite , and the second term as the mean qfi over the eigenstates .",
    "the third term can be regarded as a sum of harmonic mean of transition terms .",
    "there are several similar formulas in the literature where the summation in the last term runs over all the eigenstates , as long as  @xmath28 .",
    "( [ eq : qfi2 ] ) have some advantages over them both in analytical and numerical calculations since @xmath29 are symmetric and one only need to find the non - varnishing eigenstates of @xmath11 .      in quantum estimation theory ,",
    "the most fundamental parameter estimation task is to estimate a small parameter @xmath4 generated by some unitary dynamics @xmath30 here @xmath8 is a hermitian operator and can be regarded as the generator of parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this form of parameterization process is typical in interferometers .",
    "for instance , in a ramsey interferometer @xmath8 can be a collective angular momentum operator @xmath31  @xcite , which can be viewed as a generator of su(2 ) . in mach - zehnder interferometers , denoting @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( i=1,2 ) as the annihilation and creation operators for _ _ i__th mode , then @xmath8 can be ( 1 ) the photon number difference between two modes : @xmath34  @xcite , ( 2 ) the number operator in one mode : @xmath35  @xcite , ( 3 ) the number operator to the _ _ k__@xmath36 power : @xmath37 , in a nonlinear interferometer  @xcite .",
    "suppose the initial state @xmath38 has already been decomposed as @xmath39 here we assume @xmath38 is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "after the unitary rotation , @xmath11 can be decomposed as @xmath40 with @xmath41    substituting eq .",

    "since @xmath18 is independent of @xmath4 , the classical contribution vanishes . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfi3 ] ) is the mean variance of @xmath8 over the eigenstates , while the second term is a sum of transition probability of @xmath8 with a harmonic mean weight .",
    "if  @xmath38  is a pure state , we can take @xmath45 then @xmath46 if  @xmath38  only has two nonzero components , we take @xmath47 and @xmath48 when @xmath49 , then @xmath50 in the following , we take @xmath51 as our main interest .",
    "according to eq .  ( [ eq : qfi2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfi3 ] ) , we only need to find the non - vanishing eigenstates of the density operator rather than all its eigenstates .",
    "however , it is generally not feasible to get the analytical diagonalization of  @xmath11 . in that case",
    ", one has to resort to numeric methods or decompose the density operator into a nonorthogonal basis and use the convexity of qfi .    in this paper , we develop a systematic routine to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of a density operator of rank 2 and apply it to an interesting scenario .",
    "let us consider a @xmath9 density operator @xmath52 on a @xmath53 basis @xmath54 where @xmath55 are normalized states and @xmath56 are real numbers due to the hermiticity of density operator .",
    "the special case when @xmath57 and @xmath58 are orthogonal is discussed in appendix a. in order to get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath52 , we first recast it into an orthogonal basis ( one can also solve the eigen problem in the original nonorthogonal basis , see appendix b. )    denoting @xmath59 , we introduce a new set of basis by the gram - schmidt procedure @xcite @xmath60 , @xmath61 , the density matrix in the new basis reads @xmath62 the determinant of this density matrix , expectation value of @xmath63 and off - diagonal phase read @xmath64    according to appendix a , the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath52 can be expressed in terms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for clarity , we denote the eigenvalues and eigenstates as @xmath67 and @xmath68 correspondingly .",
    "the values of @xmath67 are @xmath69 and the eigenstates read @xmath70 hence the density matrix can be decomposed as @xmath71 alternatively , one can transform the eigenstates back to the nonorthogonal basis , @xmath72",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , the author analyzed the qfi of an entangled coherent state(ecs ) in the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the main idea of their proposition is as follows .",

    "then a parameter is imprinted in one of the mode by a unitary phase shift @xmath77 .",
    "they modeled particle loss in the realistic scenario by two fictitious beam splitters @xmath78 @xmath79 with the same transmission coefficient t. when @xmath80 , the interferometer has no photon loss . here",
    "the subscript @xmath81 represent the environment modes .",
    "after tracing out the environment modes , they got the density matrix of the original mode @xmath82 .",
    "to calculate the qfi of @xmath82 , they adopted numerical methods and truncated the coherent state at @xmath83 . using the approach developed in sec .",
    "( ii ) and sec .",
    "( iii ) , we can give the analytical expression of the qfi .",
    "in the following , we reformulate the density operator in a form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonorthrho ] ) .",
    "first , we denote the density operator before phase shift and particle loss as @xmath84 in the interferometer , @xmath85 suffers both particle loss and phase shift before exiting the second 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "the phase accumulation @xmath86 and the particle loss process , indicated by the fictitious beam splitters @xmath87 , @xmath79 , are interchangeable  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath79 satisfy the relation  @xcite @xmath88 thus the final reduced density operator can be written as @xmath89 the authors in ref .",

    "therefore we can calculate the qfi of @xmath93 by finding the decomposition of @xmath92 . with the denotation of @xmath94 @xmath92 can be specifically calculated as @xmath95.\\label{eq : rho12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can see @xmath92 has the same form of eq .",
