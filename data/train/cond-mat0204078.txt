    "the genetic code is the biochemical system for gene expression .",
    "it deals with the translation , or decoding , of information contained in the primary structure of dna and rna molecules into protein sequences .",
    "therefore the genetic code is both , a physico  chemical and a communication system .",
    "physically , molecular recognition depends on the degree of complementarity between the interacting molecular surfaces ( by means of weak interactions ) ; informationally , a prerequisite to define a code is the concept of distinguishability .",
    "it is the physical indistinguishability of some codon ",
    "anticodon interaction energies that makes the codons synonymous , and the code degenerate and redundant  @xcite .",
    "in natural languages  @xcite as well as in the genetic code the total redundancy is due to a hierarchy of constraints acting one upon another .",
    "the specific way in which the code departs from randomness is , by definition , its structure .",
    "it is assumed that this structure is the result of the hierarchical order of the interaction energies of the bases in codon  anticodon recognition .",
    "the hypercube structure of the genetic code as currently introduced  @xcite will be described and its implications for molecular evolution and test  tube evolution experiments will be discussed . as we shall see the genetic code may be represented by a six  dimensional boolean hypercube in which the codons ( actually the code  words ; see below ) occupy the vertices ( nodes ) in such a way that all kinship neighborhoods are correctly represented .",
    "this approach is a particular application to binary sequences of length six of the general concept of sequence  space , first introduced in coding theory by hamming  @xcite .    a code ",
    "word is next to six nodes representing codons differing in a single property .",
    "thus the hypercube simultaneously represents the whole set of codons and keeps track of which codons are one  bit neighbors of each other .",
    "different hyperplanes correspond to the four stages of the evolution of the code according to the co  evolution theory  @xcite .",
    "transitions within three of the `` columns '' ( four  dimensional cubes ) , consisting of the codon classes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , lead to silent and conservative amino acid substitutions ; while transitions in the same hyperplane ( four  dimensional subspace belonging to any of the codon classes @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) lead to non  conservative substitutions as frequently found in proteins .",
    "the proposed structure demonstrates that in the genetic code there is a good balance between conservatism and innovation . to illustrate these results several examples of the non ",
    "conservative variable positions of homologous proteins are discussed .",
    "two different behaviors were found :    * there are sites in which the different amino acids may be explained by one or two `` attractor nodes '' ( coding for the dominating amino acid(s ) ) and their one  bit neighbors in the codon hypercube , and * there are sites in which the amino acids correspond to codons located in closed paths in the hypercube .",
    "very recently the rapid evolution of a protein _ in vitro _ by dna shuffling has been accomplished by stemmer  @xcite .",
    "this experiment , called by smith `` sexual pcr '' , was further discussed in  @xcite .",
    "smith recalls that stemmer investigated the @xmath8lactamase gene tem1 which has a very low activity against the antibiotic cefoxtamine .",
    "] after three cycles of mutagenesis , recombination and selection he found the minimum inhibitory concentration to be @xmath9 times higher than that of the original clone .",
    "it will be shown that , without exception , the amino ",
    "acid replacements in tem1 mutants selected for high resistance to cefotaxime may be accounted by one bit changes of the corresponding codons .",
    "this shows that the structure of the code permits a very significant change in function of the coded protein by means of one  bit changes of some of the codons , provided that these mutations are integrated in a single polynucleotide by recombination .",
    "the four bases occurring in dna ( rna ) macromolecules define the corresponding alphabet @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "each base is completely specified by two independent dichotomic categorizations ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) :    * according to its chemical type @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are purines and @xmath14 are pyrimidines and * according to @xmath15bonding , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are weak and @xmath18 are strong bases .",
    "the third possible partition into imino / keto bases is not independent from the former ones . denoting by @xmath19 the chemical type and by @xmath20 the @xmath15bond category of the base @xmath21 at position @xmath22 of a codon",
    "our basic assumption says that the codon ",
    "anticodon interaction energy obeys the following hierarchical order : @xmath23    this means , that the most important characteristic determining the codon ",
    "anticodon interaction is the chemical type of the base in the second position ; the next most important characteristic is whether there is a weak or strong base in this position ; then the chemical type of the first base and so on .",
    "the above assumption goes beyond the early qualitative view that the optimization between stability and rate , that is always found for enzyme  substrate interactions , also applies to the codon ",
    "anticodon interaction  @xcite .",
    "besides , several authors have suggested that three bases are needed for effectively binding the adapter to the messenger . from this",
    "it maybe inferred that codon s size determines a range of codon  anticodon overall interaction strength within which recognition can occur .",
    "genetic translation rate is limited , among other things , by codon ",
    "anticodon recognition which , in turn , depends on base  pair lifetimes in a given structural situation .",
    "these life ",
    "times are influenced by the nature of the pairs : they are shorter for @xmath24 than for @xmath25 pairs  @xcite .",
    "the bases are represented by the nodes of a 2cube ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first attribute is the chemical character and the second one is the hydrogen ",
    "bond character . extending this association to base triplets ,",
    "each codon is associated in a unique way with a codeword consisting of six attribute values ( see table  1 ) .",
    ".gray code representation of the genetic code . in the first and fourth blocks the six  dimensional vectors ( code  words ) are shown . in the second and fifth blocks",
    "appear the corresponding codons . finally , in the third and sixth columns the amino acids in single letter notation .",
    "the first two digits correspond to the first base , the following two to the second base and the last two to the last base , according to the binary codification of the bases of fig .  1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in some of the hypercube directions single feature codon changes ( one  bit code  word changes ) produce synonymous or conservative amino acid substitutions in the corresponding protein ( when the transitions occur in three of the 4cubes displayed as `` columns '' in figs .",
    "[ fig2a ] and [ fig2b ] ) ; while in other directions lead to context dependent replacements which , in general , conserve only certain physical properties . however , if these properties are the only relevant ones in the given context , the substitution has little effect on the protein structure as well .",
    "these low  constraint sites facilitate evolution because they allow the transit between hypercube columns belonging to amino acids with very different physico  chemical properties ( e.g. hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids , respectively ) .",
    "an @xmath26dimensional hypercube , denoted by @xmath27 , consists of @xmath28 nodes each addressed by a unique @xmath26bit identification number .",
    "a link exists between two nodes of @xmath27 if and only if their node addresses differ in exactly one bit position .",
    "a link is said to be along dimension @xmath22 if it connects two nodes which addresses differ to as the @xmath22th bit ( where the least significant bit is referred to as the @xmath29th bit ) .",
    "@xmath30 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] .",
    "two nodes in a hypercube are said to be adjacent if there is a link between them .",
    "the ( hamming ) distance between any two cube nodes is the number of bits differing in their addresses .",
    "the number of transitions needed to reach a node from another node equals the distance between the two nodes .",
    "a @xmath31dimensional sub - cube in @xmath27 involves @xmath32 nodes which addresses belong to a sequence of @xmath26 symbols @xmath33 in which exactly @xmath31 of them are of the symbol @xmath34 ( i.e. the do nt care symbol which value can be @xmath29 or @xmath35 ) .",
    "the idea to propose a gray code representation of the genetic code goes back to swanson  @xcite where this concept is explained in detail ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "however , a great number of different gray codes can be associated to the genetic code depending on the order of importance of the bits in a code  word . in table  1",
    "our chosen gray code is displayed .",
    "it is constructed according to our main hypothesis @xmath36    for example , the first two lines of the table differ in the last bit corresponding to @xmath37 ; which is the least significant bit ; the second and the third lines differ in the next least significant bit , i.e. @xmath38 , and so forth .",
    "this section is more mathematical than the rest of the paper .",
    "it is not essential for the understanding of the rest of the paper .    in a pioneering paper danckwerts and",
    "neubert  @xcite discussed the symmetries of the sixteen @xmath39 codon doublets in terms of the klein4 group of base transformations . here",
    "their result will be recast in a form of a decision  tree ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) and their analysis will be extended to the @xmath40 doublets .",
    "they found the following structure for the set @xmath41 of @xmath39 doublets :    starting from @xmath42 generate the set : @xmath43 ac \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\       & = & \\left\\ { ac , cc , cg , cu \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ m_1 & = & \\left [ \\left(1,1\\right ) \\cup \\left(\\beta,1\\right ) \\right ]          m_0\\nonumber\\\\ m_2 & = & \\left(\\alpha,\\alpha\\right ) m_1\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 consist of four  fold and less than four  fold degenerate doublets , respectively .    the set @xmath41 can be expressed as : @xmath46 \\left[\\left(1,1\\right ) \\cup \\left(\\alpha , \\alpha\\right)\\right ] m_0\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the base exchange operators @xmath47 are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "they showed that : ",
    "a ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 are invariant by operating with @xmath48 on @xmath49 , but no operation on @xmath50 leaves @xmath44 or @xmath45 invariant . thus @xmath50 carries more information than @xmath49 and @xmath50 is therefore more important for the stability of @xmath44 and @xmath45 than @xmath49 ",
    "@xmath51 change of @xmath49 with respect to its hydrogen bond property does not change the resulting amino acids if all doublets of either @xmath44 or @xmath45 are affected .    reversing supposition and conclusion , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "may be defined as those doublet sets of 8 elements which are invariant under the @xmath52transformation .",
    "then experience shows that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are fourfold and less than fourfold degenerate respectively .",
    "    thus the third base degeneracy of a codon does not depend on the exact base @xmath49 , but only on its @xmath15bond property ( weak or strong ) .",
    "the above results can be simply visualized as a decision  tree ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the redundancy of a codon is determined only by the @xmath15bond character of @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath53 codons ( with 6 @xmath15bonds in @xmath39 ) belong to @xmath44 while @xmath54 codons ( with 4 @xmath15bonds in @xmath39 ) belong to @xmath45 .",
    "however , for codons @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( with 5 @xmath15bonds in @xmath39 ) it is not possible to decide unless one has more information about the second base : @xmath57 and @xmath58 belong to @xmath44 while @xmath59 and @xmath60 belong to @xmath45 . in all cases at most three attributes",
    "are necessary to determine the redundancy of a codon up to this point . of course",
    "the non  degenerate codons ( @xmath61 for methionine and @xmath62 for tryptophan ) will require the specification of the six attributes .    from the decision rules obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is clear that there are branches where the refinement procedure can not continue ( the branches which end in @xmath44 ) because no matter which base occupies the third codon position the degeneracy can not be lifted .",
    "this imposes a limit to the maximum number of amino acids which can be incorporated to the code without recurring to a `` frozen accident '' hypothesis .",
    "our proposal generalizes the `` 2out  of3 '' hypothesis of lagerkvist  @xcite which refers only to codons in the @xmath53 class .",
    "the sixteen @xmath39 doublets can be represented as the vertices of a four  dimensional hypercube .",
    "figure  [ fig4a ] shows that the sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 are located in compact regions .",
    "notice that this figure differs from the one introduced by bertman and jungck  @xcite who considered as basic transformations @xmath63 and @xmath64 , instead of @xmath64 and @xmath65 as we did .",
    "since the operator @xmath63 changes two bits we do not consider it as basic .",
    "let s consider now the structure of the set @xmath66 of @xmath40 doublets : exactly as before , define the sets @xmath67                 m_0^\\prime \\nonumber\\\\   m_2^\\prime & = & \\left(\\alpha,\\alpha\\right ) m_1^\\prime                  \\mbox { ( alternatively }   m_1^\\prime = \\left(\\alpha,\\alpha\\right ) m_2^\\prime \\mbox { ) } ~,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 consists of the doublets @xmath40 ending in a strong base ( ns ) and @xmath69 of the doublets ending in a weak base ( nw )",
    ".    then @xmath70 can be expressed as @xmath71\\left[\\left(1,1\\right ) \\cup \\left(\\alpha,\\alpha\\right)\\right ]   m_0^\\prime~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that the operator acting on @xmath72 has the same functional form as the operator acting on @xmath73 above , except that @xmath64 acts as the third base instead of the first .    the sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 are invariant under the @xmath74transformations .",
    "then experience shows that the 32 codons in the class @xmath75 , with @xmath40 in @xmath68 or @xmath69 constitute a complete code codifying for the 20 amino acids and terminator signal ( stop  codon ) , if allowance is made for deviating codon  assignments found in mitochondria  @xcite . for the codons in @xmath68",
    "this is true in the universal code ; for codons in @xmath69 @xmath76 should codify for @xmath41 instead of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 instead of stop signal .",
    "both changes have been observed in mitochondria .",
    "this more symmetric code has been considered more similar to an archetypal code than the universal code  @xcite . only after the last attribute",
    "@xmath80 was introduced the universal code was obtained , with the split of @xmath81 into @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and @xmath82 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath83 into @xmath62 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath78 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it has been speculated that primordial genes could be included in a @xmath85 open reading frame  @xcite .",
    "the same authors calculated that with two stop codons this open reading frames would have appeared too frequently . from the present view the assignment of @xmath78 to a stop codon was a late event that optimized this frequency ( this interpretation differs from the one proposed in  @xcite where a primordial code with three stop codons ) is assumed .",
    "other deviations of the universal code most likely also occurred in the last stages of the code s evolution .    in the same way as before the sixteen @xmath40 doublets can be represented as the vertices of a four  dimensional hypercube ( fig .  [ fig4b ] ) .",
    "the sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 are also located in compact regions .",
    "codons with @xmath40 in @xmath68 are frequently used in eukaryotes . in contrary ,",
    "codons with @xmath40 in @xmath69 are frequently used in prokaryots .",
    "the described structure of the code allows a modulation of the codon ",
    "anticodon interaction energy  @xcite .",
    "besides the results mentioned in the last section which refer to codon doublets , to further illustrate the significance of proposed approach , we are going to consider several examples of molecular evolution .",
    "the first example ( fig .  [ fig2a ] ) refers to the alignment studied using the method of hierarchical analysis of residue conservation by livingstone and barton ( fig .  2 in  @xcite ) .",
    "in position 11 appear the following amino acids @xmath86 , @xmath79 , @xmath15 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , which according to their approach have no properties in common . in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] this cluster of amino acids is shown . by looking at the atlas of amino acid properties  @xcite",
    "we see that from the properties proposed by grantham  @xcite ( composition , polarity and volume ) apparently the only requirement for the amino acids at this site is to maintain a certain degree of polarity . from this observation",
    "we may conclude that most probably it is an external site . simply by looking at such a diverse set of amino acids",
    "one can hardly realize that they have clustered codons .",
    "this clustering facilitates the occurrence of mutations that in the course of evolution were fixed , in view of the low physico ",
    "chemical requirements at the site .    as a second example ( fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] ) let us consider site 33 of the alignment of 67 @xmath89 domains , fig .",
    "6 of  @xcite .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] that the cluster around the codon @xmath90 ( @xmath15 ) explains , by one  bit changes , the amino acids @xmath86 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath15 , @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , a second cluster around the codon @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) explains the aminoacids @xmath86 , @xmath95 , @xmath94 , @xmath96 .",
    "finally , a silent change from @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) to @xmath97 ( @xmath94 ) accounts for the minor appearance of the small , neutral amino acids , @xmath51 , @xmath96 , @xmath98 . in a similar way",
    "the variation of the hyper  variable region of immunoglobulin kappa light fr1 at position 18 can be explained ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the number after the amino acid symbol in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the number of times the amino acid occurs in the alignment in  @xcite .    as a third example",
    "consider the residue frequencies in 226 globins displayed in table  3 of the paper by bashford et al .",
    "@xcite . from this table",
    "we find that there are variable positions in which one or two residues predominately occur and the rest are only marginally represented and others in which the frequencies are more evenly distributed among the amino acids .",
    "as it can be easily shown , the first class of positions may be associated , at the codon level , with one ( or two ) attractor node(s ) and its one  bit neighbors .",
    "the second one can be associated with closed trajectories in the hypercube .",
    "the corresponding figures are not included because of lack of space .",
    "finally , let us discuss the `` sexual pcr '' experiment . in the paper by smith  @xcite a table",
    "is displayed showing the positions in the tem1 gene where mutations occur , together with the substitutions found in the variant genes st1 , st2 and st4 which show increased resistance to cefotaxime .",
    "we refer to the mentioned paper for further details . locating these mutations in the hypercube ( fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] ) one can easily convince oneself that all mutations may be accounted by one  bit changes at the codon level .",
    "therefore only six codons ( four or five aminoacids ) are searched in each mutation and not 19 alternatives .",
    "this finding helps to explain why this _ in vitro _ realization of a `` genetic algorithm '' was so successful .",
    "it is well known in the field of genetic algorithms that a proper encoding is crucial to the success of an algorithm .",
    "furthermore in  @xcite it is shown the superiority of gray coding over binary coding for the performance of a genetic algorithm . as it was shown above the structure of the genetic code",
    "is precisely the structure of a gray code .",
    "therefore it is our claim that this is one of the reasons why very efficient variants were found after very few rounds of recombination .",
    "most probably other reasons are : the initial population was not random , but consisted of selected sequences and these sequences were very similar among themselves .",
    "this explanation of the results of stemmer s experiment differs from the explanation advanced by smith  @xcite .",
    "the present approach goes beyond the usual analyses in terms of single base changes , because it takes into account the two characters of each base and therefore it represents one  bit changes .",
    "besides , the base position within the codon is also considered .",
    "the fact that single bit mutations occur frequently is expected from probabilistic arguments .",
    "however , one could not expect , a priori , that a cluster of mutations would correspond , at the amino acid level , to a cluster of amino acids fixed by natural selection .",
    "we have found that this situation presents itself for many positions of homologous protein sequences of many different families ( results not included ) .",
    "the structure of the code facilitates evolution : the variation found at the variable positions of proteins do not corresponds to random jumps at the codon level , but to well defined regions of the hypercube .",
    "finally , the gray code structure of the genetic code helps to explain the success of `` sexual pcr '' experiments .",
