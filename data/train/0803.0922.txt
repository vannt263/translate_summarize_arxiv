    "solvable spin chains often provide a natural setting for testing or modeling interesting physical phenomena and mathematical results in such disparate fields as fractional statistics , random matrix theory or orthogonal polynomials . among these chains , those of haldane ",
    "shastry ( hs ) type occupy a distinguished position due to their remarkable integrability and solvability properties .",
    "the original chain of this type was independently introduced twenty years ago by haldane  @xcite and shastry  @xcite , in an attempt to construct a model whose ground state coincided with gutzwiller s variational wave function for the hubbard model in the limit of large on - site interaction  @xcite . in the original hs chain ,",
    "the spins are equally - spaced on a circle and present pairwise interactions inversely proportional to their chord distance .",
    "an essential feature of the spin chains of hs type is their close connection with the spin versions of the calogero  @xcite and sutherland  @xcite models , and their generalizations due to olshanetsky and perelomov  @xcite .",
    "this observation already pointed out by shastry in his original paper was elegantly formulated by polychronakos in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter reference",
    ", the author showed that the original hs chain can be obtained from the spin sutherland model  @xcite in the strong coupling limit , in which the dynamical and spin degrees of freedom decouple , so that the particles `` freeze '' at the equilibrium positions of the scalar part of the potential . in this regime , the integrals of motion of the spin sutherland model directly yield first integrals of the hs chain , thereby explaining its complete integrability .",
    "this procedure was also applied in  @xcite to construct a new integrable spin chain related to the original calogero model .",
    "the spectrum of this chain was numerically studied by frahm  @xcite , who found that the levels are grouped in highly degenerate multiplets . in a subsequent publication ,",
    "polychronakos computed the partition function of this chain ( usually referred to in the literature as the polychronakos  frahm chain ) by the `` freezing trick '' argument described above  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the partition function of the original hs chain was computed only very recently  @xcite .",
    "both the hs and the pf ( polychronakos  frahm ) chains are obtained from the sutherland and calogero models associated with the @xmath2 root system in olshanetsky and perelomov s approach .",
    "the @xmath1 versions of both chains have also been studied in the literature .",
    "more precisely , the integrability of the pf chain of @xmath1 type was established by yamamoto and tsuchiya  @xcite using again the freezing trick . on the other hand ,",
    "the partition function of the hs chain of @xmath1 type was computed in closed form in ref .",
    "the explicit knowledge of the partition function made it possible to study certain statistical properties of the spectrum of this chain .",
    "in particular , it was observed that for a large number of spins the level density is gaussian . as a matter of fact",
    ", this property also holds for the original hs chain , as shown in ref .",
    "the analysis of the distribution of the spacing between consecutive levels of the original hs chain was also undertaken in the latter reference .",
    "rather unexpectedly , it was found that this distribution is not of poisson type , as should be the case for a `` generic '' integrable model according to a long - standing conjecture of berry and tabor  @xcite .",
    "this behavior has also been recently reported for a supersymmetric version of the hs chain  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold . in the first place",
    ", we shall compute in closed form the partition function of the pf chain of @xmath1 type by means of the freezing trick . using the partition function",
    ", we shall perform a numerical study of the density of levels and the distribution of the spacing between consecutive energies .",
    "we shall see that the level density is again gaussian , and that the spacings distribution is analogous to that of the original hs chain .",
    "in particular , our results show that the distribution of spacings is neither poissonian nor of wigner type ( characteristic of chaotic systems ) .",
    "we shall next derive a simple analytic expression for the cumulative spacings distribution , which reproduces the numerical data with much greater accuracy than the empiric formula proposed in ref .",
    "in fact , we have strong numerical evidence that the new expression can also be applied to the hs and pf chains of @xmath2 type . in view of the berry  tabor conjecture , our results suggest that spin chains of hs type are exceptional among the class of integrable models .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ( antiferromagnetic ) su(@xmath0 ) pf chain of @xmath1 type is defined by @xmath3 + { \\beta}\\sum_i\\frac{1-{\\epsilon}s_i}{\\xi_i^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where the sums run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( as always hereafter , unless otherwise stated ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the operator which permutes the @xmath9-th and @xmath10-th spins , @xmath11 is the operator reversing the @xmath9-th spin , and @xmath12 . note that the spin operators @xmath8 and @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of the fundamental su(@xmath0 ) spin generators @xmath13 at the site @xmath14 ( with the normalization @xmath15 ) as @xmath16 the chain sites @xmath17 are the coordinates of the unique minimum in @xmath18 of the potential @xmath19 + \\sum_i\\frac{{\\beta}^2}{x_i^2}+\\frac{r^2}4\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the existence of this minimum follows from the fact that @xmath22 tends to @xmath23 on the boundary of @xmath24 and as @xmath25 , and its uniqueness was established in  ref .",

    ", one can infer  @xcite that for @xmath32 the density of sites ( normalized to unity ) @xmath33 is given by the circular law @xmath34 note that in this limit the sites density is independent of @xmath35 and is qualitatively similar to that of the pf chain of @xmath2 type  @xcite . integrating the previous equation ,",
    "we obtain the implicit asymptotic relation @xmath36 valid also for @xmath32 .",
    "the spin chain   can be expressed in terms of the spin calogero model of @xmath1 type @xmath37\\\\ + b\\sum_i\\frac{b-{\\epsilon}s_i}{x_i^2}+\\frac{a^2}4\\,r^2\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and its scalar reduction   as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath40 replacing the chain sites @xmath41 by the particles coordinates @xmath42 . since @xmath43 when the coupling constant @xmath44 tends to infinity the particles in the spin dynamical model   concentrate at the coordinates of the minimum of the potential @xmath22 , that is at the sites @xmath17 of the chain  .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath45 the spin and dynamical degrees of freedom of the hamiltonian   decouple , so that by eq .",
    "its eigenvalues are approximately given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are two arbitrary eigenvalues of @xmath49 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "we then have the obvious relations    @xmath62    on the other hand , the spectrum of @xmath63 can be easily computed by noting that this operator can be written in terms of the rational dunkl operators of @xmath1 type  @xcite @xmath64\\notag\\\\ & + \\frac b{x_i}\\,(1-k_i)\\,,\\qquad i=1,\\dots , n\\,,\\label{j-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as follows  @xcite : @xmath65\\mu^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the ground state of the hamiltonian   and @xmath67 since the dunkl operators   map any monomial @xmath68 into a polynomial of total degree @xmath69 , by eq .",

    "the diagonal elements of this matrix are given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 satisfy conditions ( i)(iii ) above .",
    "note that , although the numerical value of @xmath94 is independent of @xmath93 , the degeneracy of each level clearly depends on the spin through the latter conditions .    turning next to the scalar hamiltonian @xmath56 , in view of eq .",
