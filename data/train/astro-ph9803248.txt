    "while x - ray variability in seyfert galaxies has been the subject of intensive study ( see review by mushotzky , done & pounds 1993 , and green et al 1993 , nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) , the variability of quasars , being fainter , have received far less attention ( the zamorani et al .",
    "1984 study remains the most extensive to date ) .",
    "higher luminosity agn had been expected to be physically larger and so have slower , and most likely lower amplitude , variations .",
    "a typical quasar is 1001000 times more luminous than the highly variable seyferts , such as ngc  4051 , and so would vary at a significantly lower rate , i.e. a minimum of several days .",
    "it was probably this expectation that deterred extensive observing campaigns .",
    "this is unfortunate since we show here that x - ray variability is common , rapid and of quite large amplitude ( @xmath6 factor of 2 ) .",
    "the variability most likely originates in the innermost regions of quasar , and so can help unravel the basic parameters of the quasar central engine ( mass , geometry , radiation mechanisms , radiative transfer ) none of which are yet well constrained .",
    "these speculations are supported by compact galactic sources , for which the investigation of the `` variability properties vs. spectral shape '' and the `` variability properties vs. luminosity '' planes have brought a great improvement in our understanding ( see e.g. van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "the same is likely to happen for quasars .",
    "compact galactic sources are usually bright and variable on timescales as short as 1 ms , which means that their variability timescales can be probed by just a few observations of individual objects . for example , the galactic black hole candidate ( bhc ) cyg x-1 recently underwent two dramatic changes in its variability and spectral properties ( see e.g. cui et al .",
    "1997 ) , and it was possible to follow the whole cycle from the usual low and hard state , to a medium - high , softer state , and back to the low and hard state in the course of a few months .",
    "this is unlikely to happen in a luminous agn , even if there were similarities between agn and black hole candidates , because the variability timescales ( and the sizes and luminosities ) are probably much longer ( greater and higher ) in agn . instead , if the analogy between quasars and bhc holds",
    ", we will observe a population of quasars some in a ` high and soft ' state , and some in a ` low and hard ' state .",
    "hence the analogous observational way forward in quasars is to investigate the variability properties of samples of quasars , selected according to their spectral properties and luminosity .",

    "at this point we believe that a systematic study of a sample of normal quasars spaning the observed range of properties is needed .",
    "a systematic study of the variability properties of agns is not an easy task , since it requires :    1 .",
    "the selection of well defined and representative ( i.e. unbiased ) sample ; 2 .",
    "the availability of numerous repeated observations ; 3 .   a carefully designed observational strategy . in particular",
    ", it is very important that the sampling time is regular and that it is similar for all objects in the sample , so that the results on each object can be easily compared with each other .",

    "to compare the variability of the quasar groups more quantitatively we computed the logarithm of the ratio between each pair of flux measurements ( at two times @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the quasar rest frame ) .",
    "we then computed the median and the mean in 9 time bins for both flat and steep x - ray quasar samples :    @xmath36    the function using the mean is similar to the so called ` average structure function ' ( see e.g. di clemente et al .",

    "the error bars here are larger because of the different sampling times used .",
    "for the brightest quasar in our sample ( pg1440 + 356 ) it is possible to investigate timescales shorter than the duration of each single hri exposure .",
    "analysis of the hri light curves of each single obi reveals significant variability down to a time scale of a few hundred seconds . to quantify the amplitude of this variability we have computed a power spectrum for each of the single hri exposures and , to improve the statistics , we have added together the 12 power spectra .",
    "the resulting coadded power spectrum is shown in figure [ pds ] , along with the lower frequency power spectrum calculated at four reasonably well sampled frequencies using the full hri monitoring .",
    "the error bars represent the dispersion of the power in each bin .",
    "the power spectrum above @xmath4 hz is flat , and thus consistent with white noise .",
    "excess power is detected at @xmath38 hz , which is a factor @xmath39 smaller than that detected at @xmath40 hz , a mean 1/f distribution .",
    "unfortunately we do not have information on the power in the decade between @xmath41 and @xmath42 hz and therefore we can not tell whether the power spectrum decreases smoothly as 1/f above @xmath43 hz or rather if it breaks at an intermediate frequency . continuous monitoring up to several days is needed to answer to this question .    the uncertainty on the power below @xmath44 hz is large and then we can not assess whether the power spectrum stays constant below this frequency or rather decreases , as suggested by the low frequency point in figure [ pds ] .",
    "we can however exclude that the power spectrum continues to increase as 1/f below @xmath44 hz , although the precise break frequency is ill defined .",
    "systematic monitoring on weeks to months timescales can strongly constrain this frequency . in the framework of accretion disks models ,",
    "this timescale may be related with the thermal or viscous instabilities , and its measure could help to estimate important model parameters like the mass of the central black hole and the viscosity parameter @xmath45 ( e.g. siemiginowska & czerny 1989 )",

    "if the power spectrum stays more or less constant on these timescales then this difference is highly significant .",

    "1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "finally we note that the 1 kev x - ray luminosity and the spectral index are slightly anti - correlated ( r=0.20 ) in the sense that steeper objects tend to have lower 1 kev luminosities .",

    "( 1997 ) find a more significant correlation between @xmath20 and the 2 kev luminosity in their complete , optically selected sample of pg quasars ( @xmath52 , probability of 98 % ) .",
    "thus , low luminosity agns tend to be more variable because of the luminosity - variability correlation , but on the other hand they also tend to have flatter spectra , which diminishes their variability due to the spectral index - variability correlation . to remove the effect of the @xmath53 correlation from the @xmath54 and @xmath46@xmath20 correlations we performed a partial correlation analysis ( e.g. , kendall & stuart 1979 ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients turns out to be very similar to the previous ones ( -0.53 and 0.54 ) , giving a probability for a correlation again of 95 % .",
    "this is still a marginal result , which could be highly strengthened or weakened by adding just a few more points at low and high luminosities and at flat and steep @xmath20 .",
    "a correlation between variability and spectral shape , similar to that discussed in this paper , has been reported also by green et al .",

    "three of the six quasars discussed in this paper are also part of the di clemente et al sample ( the three x - ray flat quasars ) .",
    "di clemente et al .",
    "found that the variability amplitude increases with the rest frame frequency on both 0.3 and 2 years timescales .",
    "extrapolating their correlation in the x - ray band one would predict a @xmath56 of 0.75 and 0.83 for the 2 timescales .",
    "this is somewhat surprisingly close to the measured @xmath56 on these timescales , given that variability in the red band , uv and x - ray may well have a completely different origin .",
    "in our sample of six pg quasars we found clear evidence that x - ray steep quasars show larger amplitude variations than x - ray flat quasars on timescales from 2 days to 20 days . on longer timescales",
    "we do not find significant differences between steep and flat quasars , although the statistics are poorer . while the sample in this pilot study is small ( and expanded monitoring of a larger sample of quasars is surely needed ) , the distinction is so clean cut that we feel justified in speculating on its origin .",
    "large narrow band flux variability in sources with a steep spectrum could be induced by small changes in the spectral index without large variations of the spectrum normalization .",
    "if this is the case each source should show large spectral variability , with @xmath20 anti - correlated ( correlated ) with the observed flux if the pivot is at energies lower ( higher ) than the observed band .",
    "spectral variability of this kind has not been observed in the pspc observations of these and other quasars ( laor et al .",
    "1997 , fiore et al . 1994 ) and in nlsy1 ( boller et al 1997 , fiore et al .",
    "1998a , brandt et al .",
    "although our hri observations can not directly rule out this possibility , we therefore conclude that the observed temporal variability pattern is not likely the result of complex spectral variability .",
    "laor et al ( 1997 ) suggest that a possible explanation for the remarkably strong @xmath20@xmath24 fwhm correlation is a dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath1 .",
    "the line width is inversely proportional to @xmath57 if the broad line region is virialized and if its size is determined by the central source luminosity ( see laor et al .",
    "1997 ,  4.7 ) .",
    "so narrow - line , steep ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) spectrum agns emit close to the eddington luminosity and have a relatively low mass black hole .",
    "a similar dependence of spectral shape on @xmath1 is seen in galactic black hole candidates ( bhc ) as they change from the ` soft - high ' state to the ` hard - low ' state .    a physical interpretation for this effect , as described by pounds et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , is that the hard x - ray power - law is produced by comptonization in a hot corona and that as the object becomes more luminous in the optical - uv , compton cooling of the corona increases , the corona becomes colder , thus producing a steeper x - ray power - law . in bhc in ` soft - high ' states this power law component emerges above @xmath58 kev , while the spectrum below this energy is dominated by softer emission often associated with optically thick emission from an accretion disk . in this model quasar disc emission is at a too low an energy to observe , since the disc temperature scales with the mass of the compact object as @xmath59 , leaving the comptonized power law to dominate the 2 - 10 kev spectrum .",
    "the 0.2 - 2 kev quasar emission could be due to comptonization ( see e.g. czerny & elvis 1987 and fiore et al . 1995 ) by a second cooler gas component .",
    "the 0.2 - 2 kev and 2 - 10 kev spectral indices might well be correlated with each other , if the emitting regions are connected or if the emission mechanisms know about each other .",
    "we have undertaken a campaign of observations of the quasars in the laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample with asca and bepposax to clarify this point .",
    "preliminary results ( fiore et al .",
    "1998b ) shows that this is indeed the case : steep @xmath20(pspc ) quasars tends to have a steeper hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray power - law ( although the spread of the 2 - 10 kev indices seems smaller than that of the pspc indices ( as also found by brandt et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in a sample of quasars with similar luminosities , those emitting closer to the eddington luminosity will also be those with the smaller black hole and hence smaller x - ray emission region .",
    "thus light travel time effects would smear intrinsic x - ray variability up to shorter time scales in high @xmath60 objects , compared with low @xmath60 objects . based on this interpretation , and on figures [ stru_med ] and [ stru_mean ]",
    "it appears that the emission region of the steep soft x - ray quasars is a factor of @xmath61 smaller than that of flat soft x - ray quasars ( about @xmath62 cm and @xmath63 cm respectively ) .",
    "alternatively , the higher variability of steep spectrum objects may be a true intrinsic property , which could be induced by some increased instability in high @xmath60 objects .",
    "the range of luminosity in our sample is too small to tell if the variability amplitude appears to be better correlated with black hole mass , as expected for light travel time smearing , or with @xmath60 , which would indicate an intrinsic mechanism .",
    "it is interesting to note that a completely different analysis , based on the interpretation of the optical to x - ray spectral energy distribution in terms of emission from accretion disks also suggest a small black hole mass and an high arretion rate in two nlsy1 ( siemiginowska et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that cyg x-1 in the `` high and soft '' state ( cui et al . 1997 ) shows a total root mean square variability higher than that measured during periods of transitions and in the `` low and hard '' state .",
    "this is due to strong 1/f noise , extending down to at least a few @xmath4 hz , when the source is the `` high and soft '' state ( cui et al .",
    "when the source is in the `` low and hard '' state this 1/f noise is not present ( see e.g. the review of van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "ebisawa ( 1991 ) found in a systematic study of ginga observations of 6 bhc that the time scales of variability for the soft and hard components are often different .",
    "the soft component is usually roughly stable on time scales of 1 day or less , while the hard component exhibits large variations down to msec time scales .",
    "if the time scales of bhc and quasars scale with the mass of the compact object the above two time scales translate to @xmath64 years and 0.1 day respectively for our quasar sample . for a sample of quasars with similar redshifts and luminosities",
    "this predicts a rather small scatter in the soft component and a bigger scatter in the hard component . rosat",
    "results go in this direction .",
    "laor et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) find that ( for their sample of 23 low ",
    "z pg quasars ) the scatter in the normalized 2 kev luminosity is significantly larger than that in the 0.3 kev luminosity .",
    "we conclude that the analogy between agn and galactic bhc seems to hold qualitatively for their x - ray variability properties .",
    "an alternative and intriguing possibility to explain the correlation between x - ray variability amplitude and spectral shape is that a component generated closer to the black hole dominates the emission of steep @xmath20 quasars , as in the spherically converging optically thick flow proposed by chakrabarti and titarchuk ( 1995 ) to characterize bhc in the high and soft state .",
    "if this is the case then we would again expect that the spectrum of the steep @xmath20 quasars remain steep above 2 kev ( and up to @xmath65 according to chakrabarti and titarchuk ) .",
    "observations with the asca and bepposax satellites instruments , which are sensitive up to 10 kev , ( brandt et al 1997 , fiore et al 1998b , comastri et al 1998 ) suggest that this is indeed the case .",
    "schwartz and tucker ( 1988 ) suggested that agn emission can be produced by an ensemble of acceleration sites ( i.e. shock waves ) with different electron spectral indices and therefore emitting power laws with different photon indices .",
    "in this picture the spectrum is a quadratic function in log e and the mean index at a given energy arises from the greatest number of individual acceleration sites .",
    "variability would be greatest for both steepest energy index and flattest energy index sources , each of which are dominated by fewer individual regions .",
    "this is contradicted by the present observations , unless the soft x - ray flat quasars become still flatter ( and more variable ) above 2 kev .",
    "high energy x - ray spectroscopy and variability studies are again needed to obtain a definitive answer .",
    "a rossixte monitoring campaign of 4 pg quasars , with a sampling similar to that used in the hri campaign , is in progress and could allow us to clarify this point .",
    "we have studied the variability of 6 low redshift , radio quiet ` pg ' quasars on timescales from a few thousand seconds to years using the rosat hri and archive rosat pspc observations .",
    "the quasars were chosen to lie at the two extreme ends of the rosat pspc spectral index distribution and hence of the h@xmath0 fwhm distribution .",
    "the observation strategy of the rosat hri compaign has been carefully designed to provide even sampling on these three basic timescales and to provide a uniform sampling among the quasars    we have found clear evidence that the x - ray steep , narrow h@xmath0 , quasars show larger amplitude variations than the x - ray flat broad h@xmath0 quasars on timescales from 2 days to 20 days . on longer timescales",
    "we do not find significant differences between steep and flat quasars , although the statistics are poorer .",
    "we suggest that the above correlation between variability properties and spectral steepness can be explained in a scenario in which the x - ray steep , narrow optical line objects are in a higher @xmath60 state with respect to the x - ray flat , broad optical line objects .",
    "variability on short timescale ( a few hundred seconds ) is also evident in the steep @xmath20 quasars .",
    "the hri sensitivity allows to study the variability of the brightest of these objects down to a few hundred seconds . to investigate shorter timescale variability",
    "we will have to await missions with high throughput like axaf and xmm .",
    "the magnitude of the variability of steep @xmath66 quasar does not increase on timescales longer than @xmath61 days .",
    "in particular for pg1440 + 356 the power spectrum roughly follows a 1/f law between @xmath4 and @xmath44 hz , and below this frequency flattens significantly indicating a break in the power spectrum .",
    "the frequency of the break is however ill defined , because of the insufficient sampling on timescales between 1 week and several months .",
    "the fact that flat @xmath66 quasars have comparable variability to steep @xmath66 quasars at @xmath67 hz , but significantly smaller variability on @xmath68 hz suggests that the variability power spectrum of flat @xmath66 quasars may be similar in shape to that of steep @xmath66 quasars , but with a break point scaled to lower frequencies .",
    "the other option , that the power spectrum in flat @xmath66 quasars is just scaled down in amplitude for all @xmath69 , is less favoured by our results",
    ".    a systematic study of a significantly larger sample of quasars is called for .",
    "such a study would allow one to test the strength and significance of the @xmath70 correlation , to establish if the differences in variability power spectra is due to a scaling of the break frequency , or of the overall variability amplitude , and to eventually understand if the @xmath71 correlation is driven primarily by @xmath1 or by the black hole mass .",
    "the ideal instrument for such a study would be the rosat hri , which is the only x - ray telescope which allows the required large number of short exposures .",
