    "ultra - strong pulses with intensities of the order of @xmath0w/@xmath1 , and duration of the order of attoseconds , with just few optical cycles , are feasible with present day technology ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this technological development has been motivated by the large number of possible applications , several of which rely on coherent population transfer techniques .",
    "a partial list of such applications is : stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( sti - rap ) @xcite , adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) @xcite , raman chirped adiabatic passage ( rcap ) @xcite , temporal coherent control ( tcc ) @xcite , coherent population trapping @xcite , optical control of chemical reactions @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , efficient generation of xuv radiation @xcite , coherent raman umklappscattering@xcite , breakdown of dipole blockade obtained driving atoms by phase - jump pulses @xcite . moreover , recently two schemes for efficient and fast coherent population transfer have been presented @xcite , which use chirped and non - chirped few - cycles laser pulses .",
    "another recent application @xcite presents high - order harmonic generation obtained with laser pulses with a @xmath2-phase jump . finally , the field of quantum information processing benefits from these results , since many qubit realizations rely on precise quantum levels manipulation @xcite .",
    "the three functional shapes of the smooth phase jumps used : the red is a dropping hyperbolic tangent : @xmath3 $ ] , the blue is a rising hyperbolic tangent : @xmath3 $ ] , and the black one is a hyperbolic secant : @xmath4 . in all the simulations the numerical normalized value is @xmath5",
    "the presence of few optical cycles in the pulse gives a constant phase difference between the carrier wave and the pulse shaped envelope @xcite , in contrast with many cycle pulses @xcite .",
    "moreover , optimizing the pulses parameters is proven to enhance the excited state population @xcite or optimizing coherence in two - level systems ( tlss ) @xcite . in previous works",
    "we have already presented an analytical solution for the dynamics of a tls excited with pulses of arbitrary shape and polarization @xcite . since in the model we present the change rate of levels populations within a single optical cycle is not negligible , the rotating - wave approximation ca nt be used . in other words in the present model",
    "we ca nt neglect the contribution of the counter - rotating terms in the hamiltonian @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite we have presented a similar model , representing the interaction of a tls with few - cycle pulses , where at time @xmath6 the phase of the carrier wave jumps of an amount @xmath7 , this jump being sharp and step - like . in that work ,",
    "numerical analysis of the analytic model has lead to an enhancement by a factor of @xmath8 in the population transfer , with the optimal phase jump of @xmath9 and the optimal time coincident with the peak of the envelope . in the present work",
    "we improve that model , considering a _ smooth phase change _ , i.e. not step - like but happening over a finite interval of time .",
    "this new model more closely describes a realistic experimental scenario .",
    "the pulse is characterized by : rabi frequency @xmath10 , pulse width @xmath11 , carrier frequency @xmath12 , phase jump amplitude @xmath7 , phase jump time @xmath13 and phase jump duration @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , we consider two _ qualitative parameters _ : the phase jump shape , and the pulse envelope shape",
    ". we present an analytical solution for the time evolution of the excited state s population , together with a numerical simulation . in the numerical simulation",
    "we use 3 functional shapes for the smooth phase jump : rising hyperbolic tangent , dropping hyperbolic tangent , and gaussian peek , ( see figure 4 ) , whereas for the envelope a gaussian peak has been used . numerically optimizing the pulses parameters we have obtained enhancements for the population transfer of the order of @xmath15 .",
    "example of an excitation field with few oscillations and two different phases , thick solid(cosine ) and dashed lines(sine ) , encompassed by a pulsed envelope ( thick dashed line ) . here",
    "the field is written in the form e@xmath16 where @xmath17 for cosine and @xmath18 for sine pulse . ]",
    "be @xmath19 and @xmath20 the states of a two - level atom ( tla ) , with energy difference @xmath21 , and atomic dipole moment @xmath22 . if we let this system interact with a classic field @xmath23 , the equations of motion for the relative wavefunctions are @xcite :    [ tla1 ] @xmath24     +   +    where @xmath25 is the detuning from resonance . similarly to @xcite , defining @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we have the following riccati equation : @xmath28 the approximate solution for eq .",
    ", in terms of the tip angle @xmath29 is given as in @xcite @xmath30\\right.\\\\ & \\left .",
    "\\times \\exp\\left[2\\int_{t'}^{t}\\theta(t'')\\dot{\\theta}^{*}(t'')dt''\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the tip angle @xmath31 has been defined as @xmath32 from which we have @xmath33 .",
    "what is of interest is the asymptotic behavior of @xmath34 . in @xcite",
    "is shown good agreement between the analytical and a numerical simulation . to introduce the phase jump",
    ", we can write the rabi frequency as @xmath35 and then , using the same method as in @xcite , we can obtain an approximated analytic solution for the riccati equation : @xmath36,\\ ] ] the approximate analytical solution is in good agreement with the numerical simulation obtained by directly solving the coupled differential eq.(1 ) . from fig.(3 ) we see that even for complex phase function the agreement is good . for the sake of completeness , we have added an appendix in which we show the strength of this approach beyond standard tls .",
    "indeed the riccati equation approach gives a closed compact form from which both the temporal and steady - state behavior of the two and three - level system can obtained .",
    "an interesting observation is that it is possible to rewrite the rabi frequency in as @xmath37}\\ ] ] and then define @xmath38 and interpret this as a modulation of the atomic frequency , instead of a modulation of the excitation .",
    "experimentally this can be realized in several ways , e.g. using modulated zeeman or stark effect .",
    "now we move to discuss our numerical simulation of the dynamics of the two - level atom interacting with ultra - short , off - resonant and gradually changing phase @xmath39 .",
    "we have performed numerical solution of the riccati equation , using different types of phase change ( smooth phase jump ) functions .",
    "the result of this numerical analysis is shown in figure [ simulations - fig ] .",
    "the goal of this study is to find the best phase change which allows for the best coupling ( most efficient energy exchange ) of the excitation pulse with the excited state .    in figure [ simulations - fig ] we present the results of the numerical analysis .",
    "each of the three rows of plots refers to a different functional shapes of the smooth phase jump ( phase change function ) . for each row",
    "we have a plot of the smooth phase jump , a plot of the excited state s population as function of time , and a plot of the excited state s population left after the application of the pulse as a function of the normalized excitation frequency .",
    "similarly to figure [ comparison - fig ] , the functional form of the excitation pulse is @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , for the plots of of the excited state s population as function of time we have used the numerical value of @xmath41 .    for this numerical simulation",
    "we have considered the following three phase functions ( a)(b)(c ) : @xmath42 $ ] , ( d)(e)(f ) : @xmath43 $ ] and ( g)(h)(i ) @xmath44 .",
    "we can see how the phase change duration @xmath14 , i.e. the steepness of the @xmath39 function , has not an unique effect on the excited population , and depends on the general shape of the phase change . in particular , it is worth noting that for ascending and descending phase changes built on the @xmath45 function the effect of the steepness is opposite .",
    "we can observe a global behaviour which relates the characterizing parameters of the phase change with the amplitude of the population of the excited state .",
    "qualitatively , for the ascendent hyperbolic tangent we observe that by increasing the slope the population increases . on the other hand , for the descendent hyperbolic tangent the effect of this parameter",
    "is reversed : decreasing the slope of phase change leads to a decrease of the population .",
    "we remark that these behaviors are only global , and are reversed for some small ranges of frequencies . as an example , in plot 4.(f ) , for low ranges of laser frequencies , by decreasing the slope we increase the population , which is opposite of the behavior observed for higher frequencies . for the peaked shape ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "no general behaviors are observed .",
    "however , for the intermediate range of frequencies it can be observed a link between the increasing of the pulse width and the increase of the population .",
    "to conclude , here we report our analytical and numerical results to show the effect of smooth phase jump on the dynamics ( both transient and steady - state ) .",
    "we observed that the temporal profile of the phase jump function @xmath39 has a profound effect on the excited state population @xmath19 .",
    "the two - level considered here can be the zeeman - sublevels and the ultra - short ( few to multi - cycle ) pulse would be in the radio - frequency regime which has been reported in@xcite .",
    "for an optimized phase function ( within the set of parameters considered here ) , we were able to an observe an enhancement of @xmath15 in the population transfer .",
    "such enhancement is seen in fig .",
    "4(f ) ( blue curve ) which takes the value of @xmath47 at @xmath48 and phase function is @xmath43 $ ] where @xmath49 . when @xmath50 the excited state population is enhanced by factor of @xmath51 .",
    "similar enhancement is also observed for the phase function @xmath43 $ ] at frequency @xmath52(see fig .",
    "we not only can enhance excitation but for the same phase function and other choice of the parameter @xmath53 , we can also suppress it .",
    "for example at near resonant excitation ( see fig .",
    "4(f ) ) , the excited state population can be suppressed by @xmath54-fold when @xmath55 ( red curve ) in comparison to @xmath56 ( black curve ) . such control over excited state dynamics using smooth phase jump as an external parameter can be useful in microwave controlled raman@xcite , eit with superstructures@xcite to name a few while on the other hand with recent proposal on coherence - enhanced spaser@xcite and propagating surface plasmon polaritons@xcite also viable areas to explore phase effects .",
    "the approximate analytical solution are in excellent agreement for both delta function@xcite or smooth phase jump considered here .",
    "we also extended this approach beyond two - level atom to three - level in lambda configuration .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with yuri rostovtsev . p. k. jha acknowledges herman f. heep and minnie belle heep texas a&m university endowed fund held and administered by the texas a&m foundation and robert a. welch foundation for financial support .",
    "motivation to add an appendix on the approximate analytical soltuion for three - level system in lambda configuration is to enlighten the strength of the method used to find the solution for two level atom with and without phase jumps . for",
    "the sake of simplicity we will consider constant phase @xmath7 . let us consider a three - level atom(thla ) in @xmath57 configuration [ see fig",
    ". 5 inset ] . the transition @xmath58 is driven by the field @xmath59 , while the field @xmath60 couples the @xmath61 transition . for the time scale considered in this problem , we have neglected any decays ( radiative and non - radiative ) .",
    "the equation of motion for the probability amplitudes for the states @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the thla can be written as @xmath65@xmath66@xmath67 where @xmath68 is defined as the effective rabi frequencies @xmath69 to solve for @xmath70 and @xmath71 let us define @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 eqs.([e1 ] , [ e2 ] , [ e3 ] ) reduces to @xmath75 @xmath76     numerical(red dotted line ) and analytical ( blue solid line ) solutions of the amplitude of the state @xmath19 after long time in function of @xmath77 for the laser pulse envelopes @xmath78 .",
    "for numerical simulation we chose @xmath79 . ]    in order to solve these equations we extended the method developed@xcite . by neglecting the non - linear term @xmath80 and the term @xmath81 in eq.([e4 ] )",
