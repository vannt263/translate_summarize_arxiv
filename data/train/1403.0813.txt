    "sonyc - short for _ substellar objects in nearby young clusters _ - is a comprehensive project aiming to provide a complete , unbiased census of substellar population down to a few jupiter masses in young star forming regions .",
    "studies of the substellar mass regime at young ages are crucial to understand the mass dependence in the formation and early evolution of stars and planets .",
    "although the low - mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) has been the subject of intensive investigation over more than a decade , and by various groups , its origin is still a matter of debate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the relative importance of several proposed processes ( dynamical interactions , fragmentation , accretion , photoevaporation ) responsible for the formation of brown dwarfs ( bds ) is not yet clear .",
    "the sonyc survey is based on extremely deep optical- and near - infrared wide - field imaging , combined with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and @xmath14 photometry catalogs , which are correlated to create catalogs of substellar candidates and used to identify targets for extensive spectroscopic follow - up . in this work for the first time",
    "we also include a proper motion analysis , which greatly facilitates the candidate selection .",
    "our observations are designed to reach mass limits well below 0.01@xmath2m@xmath7 , and the main candidate selection method is based on the optical photometry . this way we ensure to obtain a realistic picture of the substellar population in each of the studied cluster , avoiding the biases introduced by the mid - infrared selection ( only objects with disks ) , or methane - imaging ( only t - dwarfs ) .",
    "so far we have published results for three regions : ngc 1333 @xcite , @xmath15 ophiuchi @xcite , and chamaeleon - i @xcite .",
    "we have identified and characterized more than 50 new substellar objects , among them a handful of objects with masses close to , or below the deuterium burning limit .",
    "thanks to the sonyc survey and the efforts of other groups , the substellar imf is now well characterized down to @xmath16m@xmath17 , and we find that the ratio of the number of stars with respect to brown dwarfs lies between 2 and 6 . in ngc1333 we find that , down to @xmath18m@xmath17 , the free - floating objects with planetary masses    in this paper we present the sonyc campaign in the lupus@xmath23 star forming region .",
    "the lupus dark cloud complex is located in the scorpius - centaurus ob association and consists of several loosely connected dark clouds showing different levels of star - formation activity ( see @xcite for a detailed overview ) .",
    "the main site of star formation within the complex is lupus@xmath23 , which contains one of the richest associations of t - tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the center of lupus@xmath23 is dominated by the two most massive members of the entire complex , the two herbig ae / be stars known as hr  5999 and hr  6000 .",
    "more than half of the known lupus@xmath23 members are found in the @xmath19 pc@xmath4 area surrounding the pair @xcite .",
    "the low - mass ( sub-)stellar content of lupus@xmath23 was extensively investigated using the data from the spitzer space telescope . @xcite compiled the most complete census of stars and brown dwarfs in lupus@xmath23 at the time , using the data from their survey , together with the results of previous surveys by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up in the optical ( flames / vlt ) by @xcite confirmed the effectiveness of mir - excess selection from @xcite , with about 80% of the 46 observed sources confirmed as members of lupus@xmath23 .",
    "two wide - area photometric surveys in lupus were conducted using the wide field imager ( wfi ) at the la silla 2.2-m telescope .",
    "@xcite identified 22 new low - mass member candidates in an area of 1.6 deg@xmath4 in lupus@xmath23 , with about half of the candidates confirmed spectroscopically in surveys by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite surveyed an area of more than 6 deg@xmath4 in the lupus  1 , 3 , and 4 clouds and identified @xmath2070 new candidate members of lupus@xmath23 .",
    "about 50% of the photometric sample was revealed to belong to a background population of giant stars in a follow - up spectroscopic study by @xcite .",
    "the deepest survey so far in lupus@xmath23 @xcite , did not report any brown dwarfs , despite the sensitivity to objects with sub - jupiter masses .",
    "however , the surveyed area of @xmath21 was very small compared to the total extent of the cluster , and thus contained only a minor fraction of the total population .",
    "the substellar population in lupus@xmath23 remains therefore poorly constrained .",
    "the distance to the lupus star forming region is still a matter of debate , with the distance determinations from different studies ranging from 140 pc to 240 pc @xcite .",
    "a widely - used value of @xmath22 pc was derived by @xcite using photometry and spectroscopy of f - g field stars in lupus . using an improved version of the same method",
    ", @xcite obtained a distance of @xmath23 pc , but also suggest that the apparent thickness of lupus might be the result of different lupus sub - clouds being at different distances .",
    "distances obtained from the moving - cluster method @xcite suggest a thickness of @xmath24pc , and places lupus@xmath23 at a distance of about 170 pc , or 25 pc farther than the center of the greater association .",
    "this spatial arrangement is in general agreement with the distances derived from hipparcos parallaxes of individual stars located in different sub - clouds @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "while a distance of 150 pc seems adequate for most of the clouds of the complex , a value of 200 pc is likely to be more appropriate for lupus@xmath23 .",
    "we therefore adopt a distance of 200 pc throughout the analysis presented in this paper . adopting the distance of 200 pc , and evolutionary tracks of @xcite , @xcite derive an age of 1 - 1.5 myr for most of their observed members .    in this work we present new observations of the lupus@xmath23 cloud using the mosaic - ii optical imager and newfirm near - infrared imager at the ctio-4 m telescope .",
    "observations and data reduction are explained in section  [ obs&dr ] .",
    "photometry , proper motions and criteria for candidate selection are presented in section  [ candsel ] , and the spectral analysis in section  [ specanal ] .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the main conclusions in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the imaging in the @xmath5-band was conducted using the mosaic - ii ccd imager at the ctio 4-meter telescope in chile .",
    "mosaic - ii is a wide - field imager with 8 ccds arranged in a @xmath25 array .",
    "it provides a field of view of 36@xmath268 on a side , with a pixel scale of @xmath27 per pixel .",
    "we observed four pointings arranged around the two bright herbig ae / be stars .",
    "the details of the observing run are summarized in table  [ t_obs ] , and the observed field is shown in figure  [ spatial ] .",
    "we reduced the mosaic - ii images using tools in the @xmath28 package within iraf .",
    "@xmath29 contains the standard reduction tasks for ccd images , but adapted for the use on multi - chip mosaics .",
    "series of dark frames and dome flats were combined to build an average zero and flatfield image .",
    "the zero and flatfield correction of the science mosaics was then carried out using the task ccdproc. this also includes the subtraction of the bias level , derived from unexposed areas of the chip .",
    "for each of the four fields , the total integration time was split in a series of 24 exposures .",
    "to coadd these exposures , we first derived matching coordinate systems for all of them , using a list of usno - a2 stars ( obtained from vizier ) as reference .",
    "the frames were then matched and stacked using the tasks mscimage and mscstack. apart from a small region close to the center of the mosaic , which was excluded , this matching algorithm produces very good results . note that the depth of the mosaics is not constant due to the small gaps between the detectors .",
    "photometry on the stacked images was carried out using daophot tools within iraf .",
    "after generating a source catalogue with daofind , the magnitudes were measured within a fixed aperture radius of 10 pixels using phot. the sky background was estimated from an annulus with inner / outer radius of 10/15 pixels . to calibrate the @xmath5-band photometry we compared our instrumental magnitudes with the magnitudes of sources with @xmath30 in lupus@xmath23 from the _ deep near infrared survey _ catalog ( denis ; @xcite ) , which used a gunn @xmath5 filter centered at 0.8@xmath31 m . for each field",
    "we calculate a zero point and apply it to all sources to create a final @xmath5-band catalog .",
    "the color - dependence of the calibration was investigated by calculating a coefficient @xmath32 in the color - term a@xmath33-band photometry from newfirm data ( section  [ nir_im ] ) . ] , which typically gives a@xmath200.002 .",
    "its effect on photometry would be much smaller than the involved photometric uncertainties , and therefore it was not taken into account .",
    "photometric uncertainties combine the errors returned by daophot , with the errors of the photometric calibration .",
    "typical photometric uncertainties are 0.05 mag at @xmath34 and 0.1 at @xmath35 .",
    "the completeness limit of the deep exposures is @xmath3620.3 , with the magnitude range of @xmath2015.3 - 22 .    for the proper motion calculation ( see section  [ pm ] ) we also used the @xmath37-band data obtained with the wide field imager ( wfi ) at the mpi - eso 2.2-m telescope at la silla observatory @xcite , that were previously published in @xcite .",
    "we therefore refer the reader to that paper for a detailed description of the data reduction procedures .",
    "the field observed with wfi is outlined with dotted line in figure  [ spatial ] .",

    "* @xmath58 photometric selection results in 409 candidates ( see section  [ cmd_sel ] ) . *",
    "we further narrowed the sample of @xmath58 photometric candidates from 409 to 59 , by applying the proper motion selection criterion ( see section  [ pm ] ) . in the following sections , we refer to this sample as `` @xmath59-pm '' sample . * to complement our main optical - nir selection , we selected mid - infrared excess sources using @xmath14 irac colors ( 75 candidates ) .",
    "this list contains 19 proper motion candidates ( see section  [ mir ] ) .",
    "we refer to this sample as `` irac - pm '' sample .",
    "section  [ specanal ] describes the selection of targets for spectroscopic follow - up from the above mentioned candidate lists .",
    "figure  [ ijcmd ] shows the ( @xmath5 , @xmath60 ) color - magnitude diagram of the sources observed in lupus 3 .",
    "very - low - mass ( vlm ) objects are expected to occupy a distinct region on the red side of the broad cumulation of the background main - sequence stars . as in all the previous sonyc works , we construct the selection box in the cmd such that it represents a continuation of the sequence of the known members .",
    "we note that the majority of the known members is brighter than @xmath5=15.5 , and are thus located outside the range of the cmd shown in figure  [ ijcmd ] ( the saturation level of our optical dataset is around @xmath61mag ) .",
    "green stars show a subset of known spectroscopic members from @xcite fainter than @xmath5=14.0 , with @xmath5 and @xmath38 photometry from denis and 2mass , respectively . for clarity , below @xmath61mag",
    "we show only the three members that overlap with the sources in our selection box ( green stars ) .    for comparison",
    "we show dusty00 @xcite and bt - settl @xcite isochrones for 1@xmath2myr , adjusted to the distance of lupus@xmath23 .",
    "the isochrones are shown in the same photometric filters ( denis and 2mass ) as our data . according to the bt - settl isochrone",
    ", the majority of the low mass members are expected to be within our selection box , while looking at dusty we might be missing some objects with masses above 0.02@xmath2m@xmath7 .",
    "however , it has to be taken into account that the isochrones have no extinction applied to them , while the potential members of lupus are expected to have a certain degree of extinction , i.e. we expect them to be located to the right of the isochrones . in total , 409 sources were found within the selection box and served as the initial list of candidates for spectroscopic follow - up with vimos .",
    "further selection was performed based on the proper - motion measurements , as described in the following section .",
    "proper motion measurements are based on the wfi dataset obtained between may 28th and june",
    "3rd 1999 and our newfirm data from june 2010 and may 2011 . whenever possible , we use the data from 2011 , to assure the longest time baseline . in the following",
    "we describe in detail all the steps performed : + ( 1 ) the overlapping fields were first divided into sub - regions with the maximum size of @xmath62 , and with an overlap of 05 between the adjacent fields .",
    "we find that an area of this size typically contains a high number of sources that can be used for astrometric transformations , while being reasonably small to minimize the effects of field distortions .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the absolute coordinate calibration shows systematic offsets of up to @xmath63 between epochs in some regions , which poses a problem with cross - referencing individual sources , given the on - sky source density in lupus@xmath23 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to apply an initial offset to the coordinates in one of the epochs , to assure the correct source registration in the two epochs . to determine the offset for each sub - region created in the first step , we create two images of the same size as the newfirm and wfi sub - region of interest .",
    "the images have value of 1 at the positions equivalent to the centroid pixels of bright stars , and zero elsewhere .",
    "these images are then cross - correlated to obtain an average shift applied to a particular region ; + ( 3 ) in this step we cross - match the catalogs based on right ascension and declination .",
    "this step is used only to identify individual sources in the two epochs , but not to calculate proper motions .",
    "the maximum matching radius of @xmath64 was used , which is equivalent @xmath65masyr@xmath66 over the 11 - 12 yr baseline .",
    "+ ( 4 ) we apply a cutoff in magnitude for the matching sources , in order to discard saturated and faint ones ( we keep all the sources with @xmath67 ) .",
    "the remaining sources are used in the next step to calculate a transformation of wfi positions to newfirm coordinates .",
    "the number of sources used for the transformation in each sub - region varies between 80 and 400 , with an average of 240 ; + ( 5 ) in the final step we calculate a polynomial that describes the transformation of the wfi detector ( @xmath68 ) positions into the newfirm coordinate frame for each sub - region , using the idl procedure polywarp . in order to avoid the uncertainties in the absolute coordinate calibration , this step was performed in detector coordinates relative from one dataset to the other .",
    "we tested a 2nd and a 3rd degree polynomial and find that the two transformations give very similar final results , which is expected given the large number of sources available to calculate the transformation .",
    "any polynomial with a degree @xmath69 corrects for shift and rotation between the fields , and also largely compensates for the distortions of the two detectors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "after applying the transformation , a proper motion was calculated for each source .",
    "since the vast majority of stars used to calculate the transformation between the epochs are not lupus members , we expect a circularly symmetric distribution around ( 0,0 ) in the proper motion space .",
    "we note that some of the members might have been included in the transformation , but their number compared to the total number of sources in our survey area is negligible , and thus does not influence the results .",
    "finally , proper motions for the sources towards lupus@xmath23 are shown as black dots in figure  [ pm_all ] .    in order to assess the uncertainties of the proper motion measurements , we use the fact that the chips were divided into overlapping sub - regions in step ( 1 ) described above .",
    "this allows us to derive the uncertainties by comparing proper motions of common sources that were obtained using different sets of reference stars . for each newfirm field , we adopt a common uncertainty calculated as a standard deviation of all the differences obtained from the overlapping regions in each field . for the sources with more than one measurement , the average is adopted as the final proper motion value .",
    "@xcite performed a kinematic study of the bright objects in the lupus regions and found the average proper motion of the lupus@xmath23 members to be @xmath70mas@xmath2yr@xmath66 , and @xmath71mas@xmath2yr@xmath66 .",
    "the uncertainties quoted here represent the standard deviation of the measurements for lupus@xmath23 given in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "we select all the sources within an ellipse centered at ( -10.7 , -22.8)@xmath2mas@xmath2yr@xmath66 and with the semi - major axes equal to two times the above quoted uncertainties .",
    "this list was cross - matched with the photometric candidate catalogue described in the previous section , resulting finally in the list of 59 high - priority candidate members ( `` @xmath59-pm '' sample ; shown as filled black circles in figure  [ ijcmd ] ) .",
    "the proper motions of the members in common with @xcite are shown as red symbols in the left panel of figure  [ pm_all ] , on top of the circular proper motion distribution of all other sources in our field ( black dots ) .",
    "the right panel shows the proper motions of the photometric candidates identified in this survey ( red points ) .",
    "figure  [ pm_comp_radec ] shows a comparison between the proper motions of the lupus@xmath23 members from @xcite and the proper motions of these same sources obtained in this work .",
    "there are in total 40 matching objects .",
    "while virtually all of these sources are saturated in wfi images , the brightest ones show severe saturation effects such as strong ccd leaking , which can seriously affect the astrometry .",
    "we therefore discard the extremely saturated sources with i@xmath72 .",
    "the agreement between the two sets of proper motions is satisfactory , with all proper motions agreeing within @xmath43 .",
    "we retrieved the spitzer irac and mips photometry of lupus@xmath23 from the legacy program data archive available at the spitzer science center , using the `` high reliability catalog '' ( hrel ) created by the `` cores to disk '' ( c2d ) legacy team , made available at the ssc web site.enhanced@xmath52v1/lupus/catalogs/ ]    the @xmath14 catalogue was cross - correlated with our @xmath5-band catalogue , requiring the separation of @xmath64 or better , and uncertainties @xmath73mag in the first four irac bands . to select the mir - excess sources , we require @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this selection contains 75 sources , shown in figure  [ mir_fig ] as dots to the right of @xmath74 line .",
    "squares mark the 11 sources selected for follow - up spectroscopy . of the 75 spitzer - irac candidates",
    ", there are 19 sources that satisfy the proper motion criterion applied to the @xmath57 candidate list , and were included in the high - priority candidate list supplied to the vimos allocation software ( we name this list the `` irac - pm '' sample ) .",
    "the spitzer - irac list and the @xmath57 photometric candidate list have 7 objects in common .",
    "slits were allocated to 123 out of 409 objects , selected from the optical cmd , using the vimos mask preparation software ( vmmps ) .",
    "vmmps allows for only two priority classes . in p89",
    "the high priority list included the two proper - motion selected samples , thus containing 59 candidates from the `` @xmath59-pm '' sample , and 19 candidates from the `` irac - pm '' sample , while the rest were the photometrically - selected candidates from @xmath59 and @xmath14-irac lists .",
    "in p87 , prior to our proper motion analysis , the high priority candidates were those from the selection box , and the rest were randomly chosen objects within the fov . in total , we obtained spectra of 123 objects from the selection box , and 44 outside of it . of the 123 spectra from the @xmath59 selection box ,",
    "32 are from the `` @xmath59-pm '' sample .",
    "diamonds in figure @xmath2[ijcmd ] mark all the candidates with spectroscopy inside our selection box .      our goal is to identify young , low mass stellar and substellar members of lupus@xmath23 . among the photometrically selected candidates , we may find contaminants such as embedded stellar members of lupus@xmath23 with higher masses , reddened background m - type stars , and ( less likely ) late m- and early l - type objects in the foreground . the red portion of m - dwarf optical spectra is dominated by molecular features ( mainly tio and vo ; @xcite ) , which allows a relatively simple preliminary selection of candidates based on visual inspection .",
    "here we included all the objects with clear evidence , but also , for the sake of caution , those objects with only tentative evidence of molecular features .",
    "another property that was used in the selection is the slope , which should be positive in the red portion of the optical regime for m - type stars .",
    "earlier stellar types typically have negative slopes , or appear flat ( late k - type ) . among the rejected spectra we mainly find flat spectra with no , or with very weak indication of molecular features ( late k - dwarfs , or reddened earlier - type stars ) , and reddened featureless spectra ( background or embedded stars of spectral type earlier than k ) .",
    "we also looked for the h@xmath11 emission at 6563  ; only in one case an object was selected solely on the account of showing h@xmath11 , and despite the spectrum showing no prominent features characteristic for the m - type stars .",
    "after this preliminary selection , our sample contains 27 spectra .",
    "26 of the selected spectra are photometric candidates , while 1 source appears bluer than expected for lupus members .",
    "this source , sonyc - lup3 - 6 , will discussed in more detail in section  [ s - l3 - 6 ] .",
    "vimos was used in the spectroscopic part of the sonyc campaign in cha - i @xcite . the analysis presented here is partly similar to the one in that paper . since the cha - i observations in the first half of 2009 , vimos was equipped with new , more red - sensitive detectors , which substantially decreased fringing that previously contaminated spectra longwards of 8000 .",
    "this is fortunate not only because our wavelength range is increased , but also because it allows us to analyze the gravity - sensitive na  i features at @xmath768200 , which can provide an important constraint for the age of each observed object .",
    "youth provides strong evidence for cluster membership .",
    "we use the following features to identify members of lupus@xmath23 : + ( 1 ) na  i doublet at 8183/8195  , which shows a change in equivalent widths , and a strong increase in the depth of absorption with increasing the surface gravity ( e.g. @xcite ) . although the individual lines of the doublet can not be resolved in our spectra , the overall strength of the feature can still be used to assess the membership in the cluster even at low spectral resolutions .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the spectral region @xmath77 , shaped by tio and cah bands , also strongly affected by gravity at m types @xcite .",
    "in particular , cah absorption shortward of 7050@xmath2  is stronger in m - type dwarfs , making the peak of the feature appear sharper in dwarfs , and rather blunt in giants .",
    "+ ( 3 ) h@xmath11 emission , which is usually interpreted as a sign of accretion , and thus can be used as additional evidence for youth .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the caii triplet lines in absorption at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662   are prominent in late - k through mid - m giants , and are weaker in dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this feature can help in identifying giant contaminants at early - m spectral types where na  i doublet becomes of limited use .",
    "the points ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) are demonstrated in figure  [ spt_seq ] , showing a part of the spectral sequence ( m1 to m9 with a step of 2 spectral subtypes ) of giants , dwarfs , and members of young star forming regions ( see section  [ spt_fit ] for detailed information on spectra and citations ) .",
    "the sodium absorption is much stronger in field dwarfs when compared to low - gravity atmospheres , and thus can be used to discard background field dwarfs with spt later then m4 from our sample .",
    "also , in the low - resolution spectra of dwarfs , the absorption feature is deepest at about the average wavelength of the na  i doublet ( vertical line in figure  [ spt_seq ] ) , and appears symmetric around it . on the other hand , the feature appears asymmetric in giants with the minimum slightly shifted towards longer wavelengths .",
    "this property can be used to distinguish between giants and low - gravity young objects at spectral types later than @xmath20m6 .",
    "determination of the spectral class is less straightforward at early spectral types ( m2-m3 ) , where the cah feature at 7000  and ca  ii triplet can provide additional help . at m1 and earlier ,",
    "the low - resolution spectra start to be of limited value for membership determination .    the equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath11 line in emission is often used to distinguish the accreting objects from the non - accretors . while the chromospheric h@xmath11 emission is expected to be found in most pre - main sequence m - dwarfs due to magnetic activity",
    ", larger equivalent widths observed in class ii objects are usually interpreted as a consequence of accretion and/or outflows ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "propose the ew(h@xmath11 ) for actively accreting stars to be larger than 3  for k0  k5 stars , @xmath7810  for k7  m2.5 , @xmath79  for m3  m5.5 , and @xmath80  for m6  m7.5 stars .",
    "a similar criterion , but with finer division with respect to spectral type , and extended to the substellar regime , was derived by @xcite .",
    "the ew(h@xmath11 ) for the sonyc objects in lupus@xmath23 are given in table  [ t_spec ] .",
    "sonyc - lup3 - 1 , 7 , and 10 are revealed as strong accretors , and sonyc - lup3 - 2 , 8 , and 11 are clearly non - accretors .",
    "the remaining objects with measured ew(h@xmath11 ) all appear to be undergoing accretion according to the @xcite criterion , whereas sonyc - lup3 - 5 , 6 , and 12 fall slightly below the thresholds set by for their respective spectral types .",
    "to determine spectral type and extinction of selected candidate members , we compare each spectrum to an empirical grid consisting of spectral templates of field dwarfs , giants , and members of young star forming regions with spectral types m1 to m9 .",
    "a grid of field dwarfs separated by the 0.5 spectral subtype was created by averaging a number of available spectra at each sub - type . in case of giants , the grid consist of a collection of available spectra , with a step of 0.5 - 1 spectral subtypes . ,",
    "and from @xcite ] the grid of young objects ( 1 - 3 myr ) consists of the spectra of objects in cha  i , taurus , and @xmath81cha @xcite , with steps of 0.25 - 0.5 spectral subtypes .",
    "spectral type and extinction can be fitted simultaneously .",
    "the template spectra were first smoothed to match the resolution of the vimos spectra , and rebinned to the same wavelength grid .",
    "the region around the h@xmath11 line was masked .",
    "the best fit parameters were determined by minimizing the test value @xmath82 defined as @xmath83 where o is the object spectrum , t the template spectrum , and n the number of data points .    as mentioned before",
    ", spectral classification becomes less reliable at low resolution for objects of spectral type m3 and earlier .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that at these early spectral types , the fitting scheme gives similar results for different spectral classes .",
    "some level of degeneracy with respect to spectral classes is also present at later spectral types , but only in a few cases .",
    "it is therefore clear that the final assessment of class ( i.e. membership ) can not be based on this fitting scheme only .",
    "however , there is much less degeneracy present with respect to the spectral subtype and a@xmath84 , also for the objects with degenerate spectral class . typically , several best - fit results cluster within @xmath85 spectral subtype and @xmath86mag in a@xmath84 , or less , from the best - fit value .",
    "we therefore adopt these values as typical uncertainties of the fitting procedure .    to determine membership status of an object , several best fits at each spectral class are inspected visually , in order to check for the presence or shape of the spectral features discussed in the previous section .    of the initial 27 spectra we started with ,",
    "9 objects are classified as field dwarfs because of the deep na  i absorption and the lack of h@xmath11 emission ( see figure  [ spec_dwarfs ] ) .",
    "two spectra are best represented by spectra of early - m giants , while four objects have m - dwarf features that are less pronounced than in m1 dwarfs , i.e. are probably of earlier spectral type ( bottom 6 spectra in figure  [ spec_giants ] ) .",
    "the spectra of the latter 4 objects ( sonyc - lup3 - 14 , 17 , 22 , and 23 ) all show evidence for caii triplet in absorption .",
    "the spectra of sonyc - lup3 - 17 and 23 also have very weak or non - existent na  i absorption , thus are probably background giants .",
    "the spectra of sonyc - lup3 - 14 and 22 have lower s / n , which poses a difficulty in final classification .",
    "the depth of the na  i in the spectrum of sonyc - lup3 - 14 hints to a high - gravity atmosphere , but for the sake of caution , we prefer to keep the membership status of both objects as uncertain .",
    "seven spectra are best fit by young dwarf templates with no degeneracy in spectral class ( sonyc - lup3 - 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 10 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the object sonyc - lup3 - 10 is best matched with a m8.75 young dwarf template , that was derived by averaging the spectra of taurus members kpno09 ( m8.5 ) and kpno12 ( m9 ) from @xcite .",
    "all of these 7 objects also show h@xmath11 emission , and appear to have weak na  i absorption , suggesting some kind of low - gravity atmosphere .",
    "all 7 objects are also proper motion candidates .",
    "sonyc - lup3 - 12 exhibits strong h@xmath11 emission , but its spectrum is outside our fitting grid ( earlier than m1 ) .",
    "the shape of the na  i feature reveals a low - gravity atmosphere , while the lack of the ca  ii triplet in absorption make it less probable to be a giant .",
    "furthermore , its proper motion argues in favor of its membership in lupus , and therefore we include sonyc - lup3 - 12 in the list of candidate members .",
    "the spectra of these 8 best candidates for membership in lupus are shown in figure  [ memb_spec_tmpl ] , with exception of sonyc - lup3 - 6 which is , for the reasons that will become apparent in the next sections , classified as uncertain and shown in figure  [ spec_giants ] .",
    "the nature of the remaining 4 objects of early m spectral type ( sonyc - lup3 - 2 , 8 , 9 and 11 ) remains uncertain at this stage . in figure  [ spec_giants ] we show their spectra together with the best - fit young dwarf templates , but we note that other classes might give equally satisfactory fit .",
    "the cah and na  i regions for all 4 objects fit better in the dwarf class , rather than giants .",
    "the caii triplet absorption is present , which indicates that none of these objects is young .      in order to derive effective temperatures for the sonyc objects , we perform the spectral model fitting using the bt - settl @xcite and ames - dusty @xcite models .",
    "model spectra are smoothed by a boxcar function beforehand , to match the wavelength step of the vimos spectra .",
    "the three main parameters that affect the spectral shape are the effective temperature ( @xmath87 ) , gravity ( log@xmath88 ) , and interstellar extinction ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "fitting the models to our low - resolution spectra does not allow an unambiguous determination of all the three parameters at the same time .",
    "we therefore keep log@xmath88 constant for each object , and assume the value of 3.5 ( or 4 in case of ames - dusty models above 3000  k ) for the objects identified as probable young dwarfs , 5 for the field dwarfs , and 3 for the giants ( in this case only bt - settl models are used ) . for all the spectra classified as uncertain , we use the intermediate value of log@xmath88 , i.e. the same as for young dwarfs .",
    "the fitting procedure of @xmath87 and @xmath89 is identical to the one described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath87 is varied between 2000@xmath2k and 4500@xmath2k in steps of 100@xmath2k , and @xmath89 from 0 to 10 , in steps of 0.5 mag . to de - redden our spectra",
    ", we apply the extinction law from @xcite , assuming @xmath90=@xmath24 .",
    "the spectra of objects in table  [ t_spec ] with the best - fit atmosphere models are shown in the appendix ( figures  [ memb_spec_bt ] and [ memb_spec_ad ] ) , and the results of our spectral fitting procedure for these objects are given in table  [ t_models ] .",
    "the uncertainty is 100@xmath2k for the derived effective temperature , and 0.5@xmath2mag for the extinction , which reflects the spacing of the grid .",

    "the remaining sources appear well below the 100 myr bt - settl isochrone .",
    "we compared our photometry with that from 2mass , to check for variability as a possible cause of the underluminosity for some of these 7 sources .",
    "while sonyc - lup3 - 6 is too faint to be detected by 2mass , all the rest have photometry of a good quality in at least one of the j- and k - bands .",
    "sonyc - lup3 - 1 shows a difference of 0.7 mag in j , and 0.1 mag in k - band ; sonyc - lup3 - 12 show a difference of 0.3 mag in the k - band ( only an upper limit in j in 2mass ) .",
    "the remaining sources show no evidence for variability , with differences between the two photometric datasets below 0.1 mag , i.e. comparable to the measurement errors .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ spt_fit ] , sonyc - lup3 - 2 , 8 , 9 and 11 were suspected to be non - members , and figure  [ hrd ] confirms it .",
    "the remaining three sources ( sonyc - lup3 - 1 , 6 and 12 ) deserve special attention and will be discussed below . finally , the lack of the objects with similar spectral types ( early - to - mid m ) having luminosities that would suggest membership in lupus is easily explained by the saturation limit of the @xmath5-band catalog used for the selection      in addition to being one of the strongest h@xmath11 emitters among our selected sources ( ew(h@xmath11)=-77.6 ) , the spectrum of sonyc - lup3 - 1 shows presence of forbidden lines , similar to those previously observed in spectra of lupus@xmath23 members par - lup3 - 4 , sz102 , and sz106 @xcite .",
    "we identify the [ oi ] lines at 6300  and 6364 , [ sii ] line at 6731  ( possibly blended with [ sii ] line at 6716 ) , and [ oii ] at 7329 .",
    "forbidden lines such as those identified here are commonly observed in actively accreting young stars , and their ratios can be used to estimate physical conditions in the circumstellar medium and mass - loss rates @xcite . however , as discussed in @xcite , forbidden lines in t - tauri spectra are usually split into separate components sampling different physical conditions , which can not be distinguished with our low - resolution spectra . moreover , our spectra do not allow definitive identification of some lines ( e.g. [ sii ] at 6731 and 6716  ) .",
    "we therefore refrain from physical interpretation of the conditions causing this emission , and leave this to future studies at higher spectral resolution .",
    "two sources in lupus@xmath23 are reported in the literature to exhibit similar properties .",
    "sz  102 appears underluminous for its spectral type , which was was first noted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found sz  102 to be associated with a bipolar jet and a herbig - haro object .",
    "this geometry suggests that we might be viewing the star through a nearly edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite report the underluminosity of par - lup3 - 4 , and a jet associated with par - lup3 - 4 was discovered in [ sii ] images by @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss three possible interpretations for the underluminosity and emission line spectra of the two objects : + ( a ) an edge - on disk blocking a part of the stellar light , ( b ) embedded class i sources where the star is seen via the light scattered by the walls of cavities in the envelope , and ( c ) accretion - modified evolution , similar to what is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "high - resolution spectra of par - lup3 - 4 @xcite reveal a double - peaked [ sii ] profile , implying that the low excitation jet is seen at a small angle with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "the authors argue that at this inclination , only a flared disk could hide a star .",
    "@xcite studied the target sed from the optical to the sub - millimeter regime , and compared it to a grid of radiative transfer models of circumstellar disks .",
    "they find that par - lup3 - 4 is a class ii source , with an edge - on disk that naturally explains its underluminosity .    in figure",
    "[ sed ] we show the sed of sonyc - lup3 - 1 in the range 0.8 - 70 @xmath104 m .",
    "open circles mark the optical and nir photometry from the sonyc campaign , the filled grey circles show the 2mass nir photometry , squares @xmath14 mir data , and diamonds the mir photometry from wise",
    ". the double - peaked shape of the sed with a dip around 10 @xmath104 m is characteristic for an edge - on disk , where the nir peak arises from the scattered light of the star obscured by a disk , and the emission at longer wavelengths comes from the dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radiative transfer sed modeling could shed more light on the properties of the putative disk around sonyc - lup3 - 1 , but since this is out of the scope of this paper , we refrain from discussing this source further .",
    "to calculate the luminosity of sonyc - lup3 - 1 in fig  [ hrd ] , we used the a@xmath84=3.0@xmath2mag derived from fitting a model to the spectrum .",
    "the extinction calculated from the @xmath105 color is , however , significantly higher ( a@xmath106mag ) , and shifts the point in the h - r diagram in the y - direction such that it falls roughly onto the 10 myr isochrone .",
    "we conclude that sonyc - lup3 - 1 is probably a member of lupus@xmath23 , with properties similar to par - lup3 - 4 and sz  102 .",
    "the mir excess and the double - peaked sed suggest a presence of an edge - on circumstellar disk .",
    "we obtained the spectrum of sonyc - lup3 - 6 by chance alignment of the slit that was placed on sonyc - lup3 - 7 , which belongs to our high - priority candidate list .",
    "sonyc - lup3 - 6 is located @xmath107 north of sonyc - lup3 - 7 . with the @xmath60 color of 1.8 ,",
    "sonyc - lup3 - 6 is too blue to be in our photometric candidate list , i.e. the colors suggest that the object is not a pre - main sequence source . in the hr diagram , it falls well below the 100 myr isochrone .",
    "however , the spectral fitting procedure identifies the object as a young star of the spectral type m4.75 .",
    "it shows low - gravity na  i signatures , h@xmath11 emission , and no evidence for ca  ii triplet absorption .",
    "furthermore , its proper motion satisfies the proper - motion membership criterion . from the ew(h@xmath11 ) it is not clear whether sonyc - lup3 - 6 undergoes accretion or not , as it falls close to the line that separates accretors from non - accretors ( yes according to the criterion by @xcite , and no according to ) . if indeed a member of lupus@xmath23 , sonyc - lup3 - 6 might be a primary of a very wide binary system containing the m8 brown dwarf sonyc - lup3 - 7 .",
    "the projected separation of this hypothetical system would be @xmath201400 au .",
    "it would be , however , very difficult to explain a m4.75 primary that is several magnitudes fainter than its supposed secondary .",
    "we therefore classify the membership of sonyc - lup3 - 6 as uncertain .",
    "this object s spectrum suggests a type earlier than m1 , but was nevertheless selected in our preliminary analysis based on the obvious h@xmath11 emission observed in its spectrum ( figure  [ memb_spec_tmpl ] ) . according to @xcite , early m - dwarfs have shorter activity lifetimes when compared to the later m - dwarfs , which speaks in favor of sonyc - lup3 - 12 being indeed young .",
    "however , as in the case of sonyc - lup3 - 6 , the ew(h@xmath11 ) falls right at the border separating accreting objects from non - accretors ( accretor according to the criterion by @xcite , and non - accretor according to ) .",
    "when compared to the spectra of other objects in our sample with similar early spectral type ( e.g. sonyc - lup3 - 17 , 22 , 23 ) , we notice the lack of the caii absorption lines , i.e. this object is likely not to be a giant . based on this evidence , we tentatively include sonyc - lup3 - 12 in the final list of the confirmed members .",
    "it shows no mir excess , and therefore the edge - on disk morphology does not seem to be a plausible explanation for its underluminosity .      from the candidate list containing 409 objects in the direction of lupus@xmath23 cloud ,",
    "123 objects were selected for the spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "27 showed spectral features consistent with spectral type m , or slightly earlier .",
    "fitting the spectra to an empirical grid of spectra of young dwarfs , field dwarfs and giants , combined with the proper motion assessment of membership , and the positions of the candidates in the hr diagram , we identify 9 field dwarfs , 4 background giants , and 7 probable members of lupus@xmath23 , among which two show significant underluminosity for their spectral type .",
    "the nature of 7 sources remains uncertain . in table",
    "[ t_spec ] we list the 27 analyzed sources , and give their coordinates , photometry , spectral types , proper motions , ew(h@xmath11 ) , membership status , and references for those identified in the literature .",
    "in this section we use the members of lupus@xmath23 confirmed in this work to derive a relation between spectral type and @xmath87 , and combine the outcome of our survey with the results from other works , in order to establish a census of vlm objects in lupus@xmath23 , and discuss the properties of the substellar population .      in figure  [ spt_teff ] , we plot the relation between @xmath87 and the spectral type for the objects classified as members of lupus@xmath23 and with @xmath108k ( sonyc - lup3 - 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 10 ) .",
    "the upper limit in @xmath87 is set because our spectral type fitting scheme does not extend to spectral types earlier than m1 .",

    "it is a scalar with values between 0 and 1 , where a small value of @xmath113 indicates a poor fit . ] .",
    "we also show the effective temperature scales available from other works .",
    "the long - dashed line shows the scale from @xcite derived for ic348 , while the dashed line represents the scale derived for the nearby young stellar associations by @xcite .",
    "the latter scale is extrapolated below 3000  k. dash - dotted line shows the scale derived from the spectroscopic data of collinder 69 @xcite , and the dotted line is a scale for ngc1333 , derived by using the h - band peak index ( hpi ) defined in @xcite .",
    "this scale was extrapolated to the spectral types earlier than m6 , since the hpi index is defined only for later spectral types .",
    "we note that the scale of @xcite was derived from the near - infrared data , while all the rest are based on optical spectroscopy .",
    "although the trend seen in our data is generally consistent with all the previous works , some systematic offsets between the classification schemes is evident .",
    "the hpi index seems to give systematically later spectral types for a given @xmath87 in comparison to other schemes . the same trend was already reported in the @xcite , where we used the hpi to derive spectral types from nir spectra in highly extincted cluster @xmath15  oph .",
    "there we speculated that the extinction might introduce additional uncertainties to spectral type derived from the hpi , because the index was defined on a sample of vlmos in ngc  1333 , a cluster with a@xmath84 typically below 5 .",
    "lupus@xmath23 , however , has extinction levels comparable to those of ngc  1333 , while we observe the same trend towards later spectral types .",
    "it seems therefore that for hpi the trend persist irrespective of differences in extinction of the samples , and wavelength ranges used for spectral classification ( optical versus nir ) .",
    "a widely - used relation between spectral type and @xmath87 from @xcite seems to deliver systematically lower @xmath87 for the same spectral type , compared to the relation derived here , especially for spectral types earlier than m6 .",
    "the most recent summary of the population of the lupus star forming region appeared in @xcite .",
    "since then , however , various studies have identified new low - mass members , and most importantly , there have been a significant efforts to provide spectroscopic confirmation of photometrically identified candidates .",

    "we can repeat the same calculation to get an approximate number of missing bd above the completeness limit . from the sonyc sources , 3 are most probably bds ( all existing spectral classifications @xmath124m6 ) , while two have spectral types around the substellar border . among the three sources from other works ,",
    "one is a star earlier than m0 , one is classified as m7.5 ( j16083304 - 3855224 in table  [ t_census ] ) , and the remaining one is classified as m6 ( m-66 ) .",
    "the total number of spectroscopically confirmed bds in our sample of 342 low mass candidates above the completeness limit is therefore between 4 and 7 , and only m-66 does not come from the proper motion selection .",
    "the calculation for missing bds is identical to the one above , but with different success rates . for the `` @xmath59-pm '' sample we have 4 to 6 bds over 32 objects , and for the photometric candidates 0 to 1 bd over 82 .",
    "the estimated number of unconfirmed bds is then @xmath125 .      in figure  [ spt_distr ]",
    "we show the distribution of spectral types for the spectroscopically confirmed m - type population in lupus@xmath23 , found within the field covered by our survey ( top left panel ; solid lines ) .",
    "the solid error bars are poissonian confidence intervals calculated with the method described in @xcite , and the dashed histogram shows the contribution of our survey to the census .",
    "the dotted histogram includes the estimate on the number of missing objects estimated in section  [ missing ] , assuming that 6 of the objects are bds ( i.e. found somewhere in the last two bins , and equally distributed for the purpose of this plot ) , and the remaining 5 are probably low - mass stars , which due to the saturation limit of our survey around 0.06@xmath2m@xmath7 , should fall in the bin above .",
    "the dotted - line errorbars combine in quadrature the ci from the binomial distribution , with the errorbars shown with solid lines .",
    "we also show a comparison with the results from other star forming regions : cha - i ( @xcite ; top right ) , ic  348 ( @xcite ; bottom left ) , and ngc  1333 ( @xcite ; lower right ) . in the stellar regime",
    ", the distribution resembles those seen in other star forming regions , with the peak around m5-m6 , and an increase in the number of objects between m0-m1 and m5 by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "cha - i and ic  348 show a drop in the number of objects in the substellar regime with respect to stars , and this is at a similar level seen also in lupus@xmath23 .",
    "although this sharp drop at spectral types m7 and later can partially be explained by the incompleteness of our survey at lowest masses , it is likely to be a real feature of the imf considering the analysis of the missing objects in our survey presented in the previous section .    in ngc",
    "1333 @xcite , we see a second peak around m7 , which might be due to a gap in the completeness between two different spectroscopic samples that were used in the stellar and substellar regimes , causing us to miss the objects around m6 . the double peak is also seen in the distribution of absolute j - magnitudes , but this distribution is consistent , within statistical errors , with a single broad peak . on the substellar side ,",
    "the sonyc survey in ngc  1333 is deeper than the surveys in cha - i , ic  348 and lupus@xmath23 , and the completeness limit is in fact outside the @xmath126-axis range in figure  [ spt_distr ] . from the statistical analysis in the previous section ,",
    "given the relatively large errors , we can say that the spt distribution down to m9 is consistent with that of ngc  1333 .",
    "in this section we use the results of our survey , combined with previous works to get some constraints on the imf in lupus@xmath23 , extending down to the completeness limit of our @xmath57 catalog . in the following",
    ", we will take into account the area of our combined @xmath57 survey ( solid line in figure  [ ijcmd ] ) .",
    "we note that the number of missing objects calculated in the previous section is partially based on the success rates of the candidates selected from the proper motions , i.e. from a somewhat smaller area than that of the photometric survey .",
    "we , however , choose not to apply any correction to account for this because , from figure  [ ijcmd ] , it is evident that the majority of the high - priority candidates concentrate in the cloud core , and very few candidate members are expected to be missed in the surroundings .",
    "the surveys of @xcite and @xcite have a comparable sky coverage in the area around the main lupus@xmath23 core , and they also cover the northeastern clouds of lower density , that are also considered to be part of the complex .",
    "this portion of the cloud contains a lower concentration of members ( only about 10% of all the members identified in @xcite and @xcite ) , and thus excluding it should not significantly affect our analysis .    for this calculation",
    ", we compile a list of all members and candidate members from the two most extensive surveys found in the literature , @xcite and @xcite , and combine it with the sources identified in this work . as for the other works , we note that almost all sources from table  11 of @xcite and @xcite , and all the confirmed sources by @xcite , are already included either in the merin et al",
    ". list , or the sonyc list .",
    "we also include the estimated number of still undiscovered stellar and substellar members of lupus@xmath23 , as determined in the previous section .",
    "@xcite confirm @xmath127 of the mir excess sources from @xcite as probable members of lupus@xmath23 , while the confirmation rate for the @xcite sample is @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "these factors are taken into account when estimating the total number of probable members of the two mentioned studies .",
    "another important correction factor that has to be taken into account is the disk fraction , which , according to @xcite , is 70 - 80% for lupus .",
    "therefore , the number of objects from this work is additionally multiplied by a factor of 1.25 .",
    "the sample from @xcite is complete down to 0.1m@xmath7 , and nicely complements the one of @xcite , whose method is only sensitive to the objects cooler than 3400@xmath2k .",
    "the 3@xmath129 detection limit of @xcite is at @xmath130 , but the completeness limits are not specified .",
    "however , given the depth of their observations , it is probably safe to assume that they are complete in the range of masses between 0.1m@xmath7  of @xcite , and the upper limit in mass set by saturation in our optical data ( @xmath200.06 m@xmath7 ) .    to assess the numbers of stars and bds",
    ", we use the approach described in @xcite . in short , by comparing the multi - band photometry with the predictions of the evolutionary models ( bt - settl in this case ) , we derive best - fit mass and a@xmath84 for each object , for the assumed distance of 200pc , age of 1 myr , and the extinction law from @xcite with r@xmath96 .",
    "we note that the several underluminous objects identified here and in previous studies are erroneously identified by this procedure as bds .",
    "however , these are clearly stars , and therefore are counted in this higher - mass bin .",
    "all the objects with estimated masses below 0.065@xmath2m@xmath7 are counted as bds , and all those above 0.085@xmath2m@xmath7 as stars .",
    "the remaining objects at the border of the substellar regime are once included in the higher mass bin , and then in the lower mass bin .",
    "the calculated number of stars is then 80 - 92 , and the number of bds is estimated to be 28 - 40 .",
    "finally , we obtain the star / bd ratio between 2.0 and 3.3 , in line with other star - forming regions , which typically show a span of values between 2 and 6 ( scholz et al . , 2013 , in press ) .",
    "clearly , there is a number of uncertainties involved in this calculation due to possible incompleteness at the overlap of the different studies , uncertainties in age and distance , as well as the choice of the isochrones used to derive masses .",
    "it is nevertheless an useful exercise at least for a first order comparison with other works .",
    "in this work , we have presented deep optical and near - infrared images of the 1.4@xmath2deg@xmath4 area surrounding the two brightest members hr5999/6000 of the lupus@xmath23 star forming region . from the optical+nir photometry we selected 409 candidate vlm cluster members .",
