    "the observed similarities in the timing properties of different black hole ( bh ) systems suggest that the same physical mechanism is at work in sources spanning a wide range of masses ( e.g. uttley et al 2005 , mchardy et al 2006 ) .",
    "this observational fact represents an important achievement in the context of the theory of unification of bh accretion . a breakthrough in this respect",
    "was the discovery of the mass - scaling law that regulates the characteristic time - scales of variability , identified with the high frequency break in the power spectral density function ( psd ) .",
    "this relation holds for objects of widely different size ( i.e. over about eight order of magnitudes in mass , from bh x - ray binaries , bhxb , up to active galactic nuclei , agn , mchardy et al 2006 , koerding et al 2007 ) and is in agreement with expectations from standard accretion disk models , whereby all the characteristic time - scales depend linearly on the bh mass , @xmath3 ( e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1973 , treves et al 1988 ) . +",
    "another fundamental analogy emerges from the comparison of time lags between x - ray energy bands .",
    "hard / positive lags ( i.e. hard x - ray variations lagging soft x - ray variations ) are generally observed in both bhxbs and agn , and can be interpreted in terms of propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations in the disc ( kotov et al 2001 and arvalo & uttley 2006 ) .",
    "those lags are usually detected at relatively low fequencies ( i.e. below the psd high frequency break ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , a relatively new and interesting perspective comes from the study of high frequency , soft / negative lags ( i.e. soft x - ray band variations lagging hard x - ray band variations ) .",
    "the first significant detection of a soft / negative lag in agn light curves was reported in the narrow line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) galaxy 1h0707 - 495 ( fabian et al 2009 , zoghbi et al 2010 ) , and interpreted as the signature of relativistic reflection which `` reverberates '' in response to continuum changes after a time equal to the light - crossing time from the source to the reflecting region .",
    "a different interpretation has been proposed in terms of a complex system of scatterers / absorbers located close to the line of sight , but at hundreds of gravitational radii , @xmath4 , from the central source ( miller et al 2010 ) , thus requiring us to have a special line of sight to the source .",
    "+ subsequently , soft lags have been observed in several other sources ( e.g. tripathi et al 2011 , emmanoulopoulos et al 2011 , zoghbi & fabian 2011 ) .",
    "one of the largest - mass sources ( @xmath5 ) showing a soft / negative lag is pg 1211 + 143 ( de marco et al 2011 ) , whose lag spectrum appears `` shifted '' by about one order of magnitude ( with the lag frequency , @xmath6 , and amplitude , @xmath7 , found at @xmath8hz and @xmath9 s , respectively ) with respect to those measured in other low mass sources ( i.e. @xmath10hz and @xmath11 s , emmanoulopoulos et al 2011 ) . in de marco et al ( 2011 ) we speculated that this difference could be simply explained if the time - scales in pg 1211 + 143 are scaled - up by the bh mass , estimated to be about 10 - 100 times the mass of the other agn for which x - ray lags have been recorded so far . in this paper",
    "we explore this hypothesis , by studying the properties of the lag frequency spectrum in a large sample of sources , spanning a wide range of masses ( about 2.5 decades ) .",
    "the time - scales of detected soft / negative lags are then used to study correlations with relevant parameters , such as luminosity and bh mass .",
    "the sources analysed are extracted from the _ caixavar _ sample  a subsample of the caixa sample by bianchi et al ( 2009a )  presented in ponti et al ( 2012 ) , which includes all the well - exposed , x - ray unobscured ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) , radio quiet agn observed by xmm-_newton _ in targeted observations as of june 2010 .",
    "we considered all the sources having at least one observation with a longer than 40 ks exposure ( 41 sources ) , and selected those with published black hole mass , @xmath3 , estimates ( 39 sources ) .",
    "finally , we selected all the sources showing significant variability in their light curves . to this aim we made use of the excess variance estimates provided by ponti et al ( 2012 ) , computed by sampling the 2 - 10 kev light curve of each source in 40 ks segments (",
    "note that also single - interval measurements were considered ) , and assuming a time resolution of 250 s. all the sources having excess variance different from zero at @xmath142@xmath15 confidence level were included in our sample , i.e. excluding all the sources consistent with having constant flux on the time - scales of interest for this work ( @xmath16ks ) . with the latter selection",
    "our final sample was reduced to a total of 32 sources . for each source all the available observations in the xmm-_newton _ archive have been used in our analysis , apart from those highly corrupted by background flares . in the computation of the lag - frequency spectra ,",
    "multiple observations have been combined to obtain better statistics .",
    "+ only data from the epic - pn camera were used , because of its high effective area and s / n over the 0.3 - 10 kev energy band .",
    "data reduction was performed using xmm science analysis system ( sas v. 10.0 ) , starting from the observation data files ( odf ) and following standard procedures .",
    "filtered events are characterised by pattern @xmath174 , and are free from background flares .",
    "typical source extraction regions are 45 arcsec radius circles .",
    "spectra were extracted and used to select the energy bands for the computation of time lags .",
    "they were grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin , while response matrices were generated through the rmfgen and arfgen sas tasks .",
    "the analysis of the time series was carried out using routines implemented through idl v. 6.1 .",
    "correction of sporadic count rate drops ( usually involving single time bins ) in the time series , which occur as a consequence of event losses due to telemetry dropouts , was performed by rescaling the count rate within the bin for the effective fractional time bin length .",
    "we computed time lag - frequency spectra between light curves in the soft and hard x - ray energy bands .",
    "the soft and hard energy bands were selected so as to single out energies dominated by the soft excess and the primary power law . to this aim",
    "we adopted a phenomenological approach , although we note that several tests have been done by slightly varying the selected energy bounds , and the obtained results are all consistent with each other .",
    "specifically , we first fitted the data in the 1 - 4 kev energy band with a simple power law absorbed by a cold column of gas ( which accounts for any warm absorber - induced extra curvature at high energies ) , with all the parameters left free to vary . for the soft band , we fixed at 0.3 kev the low energy bound , and selected , as high energy bound , the energy at which the soft excess significantly deviates ( at more than @xmath18 ) from the extrapolation of the best fit absorbed - power law . as the hard energy band we used the 1 - 5 kev range , excluding energies where significant deviations from the best fit power law were observed , e.g. due to the presence of troughs produced by complex absorption ( at @xmath19 kev ) or to the presence of a broad fe k line red tail ( at @xmath20 kev ) .",
    "data above 5 kev were , in general , excluded to avoid contamination from components of the fe k line complex .",
    "a detailed compilation of all the adopted energy bands can be found in tables [ tab : obs ] and [ tab : obs2 ] .",
    "+ the time lag - frequency spectra are computed following the techniques described in detail by nowak et al ( 1999 ) and applied to xmm-_newton _ data in de marco et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "the time lag is derived from the formula @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the frequency - dependent phase of the average cross power spectrum between the soft and hard time series .",
    "the resulting lag - frequency spectra are rebinned multiplicatively , i.e. the bin size is set equal to @xmath23times the frequency value , with step size , @xmath24 , chosen between @xmath25 depending on the quality of the data .",
    "sources for which a negative lag was reported in the literature have been re - analyzed with our procedures ."
