    "understanding general properties of systems that are far from equilibrium remains one of the most challenging problems in contemporary physics . in recent years",
    "some remarkable progress has been made in the study of fluctuations in nonequilibrium small systems , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this progress is mainly due to the formulation of various exact fluctuation and work theorems that provide very generic statements that hold true for large classes of systems .",
    "some of the fluctuation theorems deal with the rate of entropy production , either in systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state @xcite or in systems that initially are in equilibrium before being driven out of equilibrium by an external force @xcite .",
    "one also distinguishes between detailed @xcite and integral @xcite fluctuation theorems in cases where the system is driven from one steady state to another in finite time .",
    "in addition , work theorems @xcite relate the free energy difference between two equilibrium states to the amount of work done during the switching from one state to the other .",
    "many of these theorems have been verified in various experimental settings @xcite , thus illustrating their usefulness for characterizing nonequilibrium systems .    in the past diffusion - limited reaction systems",
    "have been proven to be extremely useful in order to understand the generic behavior of many - body systems far from equilibrium .",
    "especially , the study of these systems is at the origin of our understanding of the properties of nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "whereas phase transitions in reaction - diffusion systems are by now very well characterized , this is quite different away from these special points . in the present work we discuss different ways of characterizing the steady state and transient properties of generic reaction - diffusion systems , thus contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of these important systems .",
    "recently discussed extensions of exact fluctuation theorems to nonequilibrium systems with chemical reactions mostly focused on reversible reactions and reaction networks @xcite .",
    "however , many reaction - diffusion models are characterized by _ irreversible _ reactions , thus yielding a breaking of the usually assumed microscopic reversibility . by breaking microscopic reversibility",
    "we mean that if @xmath0 is the transition probability from configuration @xmath1 to configuration @xmath2 , it can happen that @xmath3 even though @xmath4 .",
    "a direct consequence of the absence of microscopic reversibility is that many observables discussed in the context of fluctuation theorems are then ill defined , as in their derivation one explicitly uses that for any path in configuration space the reversed path also exists @xcite .",
    "for this reason we focus in our study of fluctuations in reaction - diffusion systems on an observable that is well defined even in the absence of microscopic reversibility . for a system initially in an equilibrium steady state this quantity is identical to the work observable used in the jarzynski and crooks relations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that diffusion - limited systems with effective irreversible reactions can be prepared through a fast evacuation of some of the reaction products .",
    "this makes plausible a possible future verification of the intriguing features that are revealed in our study .    in the following we discuss , using a numerical exact method and numerical simulations , steady state and transient properties of various reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "especially , we study fluctuations in systems that are initially in a steady state before being driven away from stationarity by varying one of the reaction rates .",
    "this protocol allows us to measure the probability distribution of our observable when going from a steady state @xmath5 , characterized by the value @xmath6 of some reaction rate @xmath7 , to another steady state @xmath8 , characterized by the value @xmath9 of the same reaction rate . defining the reversed process as changing the reaction rate backwards from @xmath9 to @xmath6",
    ", we can measure also the probability distribution in that case and compare the distributions for the forward and reversed processes .",
    "even though no exact detailed fluctuation theorem is observed for the studied quantity in the absence of detailed balance , we show that the fluctuation ratios display intriguing signatures due to the specific dynamics of the nonequilibrium systems under investigation .",
    "a brief account of some of our results has been given previously @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we not only give a detailed study of the features observed in the ratio of the probability distributions for our observable , we also extend our investigation to other reaction schemes not studied previously .",
    "this allows us to gain a better understanding of fluctuations in truly nonequilibrium systems driven away from stationarity and to make the discussion in @xcite more quantitative .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we introduce the different reaction - diffusion models and discuss their steady state properties .",
    "in section iii we drive these systems out of stationarity through time - dependent reaction rates . using an observable that remains",
    "well defined even in the absence of microscopic reversibility , we study the probability distributions for this variable and show that the fluctuation ratios formed by the probability distributions computed in the forward and the reversed processes display features which can be related to the dynamical properties of the nonequilibrium system . finally , section iv gives our summary as well as an outlook on open problems .",
    "we consider one - dimensional lattices made up of @xmath10 sites with periodic boundary conditions where every lattice site can at most be occupied by one particle . because of the exclusion of multiple occupancy of the lattice sites , a total of @xmath11 configurations exist .",
    "particles are allowed to jump to unoccupied nearest neighbor sites with a diffusion rate @xmath12 and undergo various creation and annihilation reactions .",
    "we discuss in the following four basic reaction schemes , see table [ table1 ] , and we denote with model 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 the four models that result from these reaction schemes . in all four models we have an annihilation process , that takes place with rate @xmath13 , as well as a creation process where a new particle is created with rate @xmath14 .",
    "the different models differ by the way creation and annihilation take place .",
    "let us first discuss the annihilation process . in models 1 and 2 ,",
    "two particles on neighboring sites undergo a reaction which leads to the destruction of one of the particles .",
    "this is different in model 3 , where both particles are destroyed at the same time .",
    "finally , in model 4 three neighboring particles are destroyed in the annihilation reaction . for the creation process",
    "we note that whereas in models 2 , 3 , and 4 new particles are spontaneously created at empty sites , in model 1 a new particle can only be created at an empty site if one of the neighboring sites is already occupied .",
    ".the different reaction schemes discussed in this work . whereas model 1 is an equilibrium model , in models 2 , 3 , and 4 microscopic reversibility is partly or fully broken . in the modified models 2 , 3 and 4 we allow for reversible reactions with rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 3.00 in     as a second interesting observation we note that the oscillations in the fluctuation ratios are not restricted to cases where microscopic reversibility is broken but are much more widespread . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] for model 3 ( the same holds for model 4 ) peaks in the fluctuation ratios also show up in some systems where all reactions are reversible .",
    "= 3.00 in     in order to understand the origin of these oscillations we need to go back to the different reaction schemes summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the configuration space of a reaction - diffusion system can be thought to be composed of smaller units formed by the configurations with a common number @xmath19 of particles .",
    "a diffusion step conserves the number of particles , thereby connecting two configurations in the same unit .",
    "a passage from one unit to another always involves a change of particle number and is therefore exclusively due to a reaction process .",
    "this is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . keeping this in mind",
    ", a fundamental difference emerges between models 1 and 2 on the one hand and models 3 and 4 on the other hand . in the former systems every reaction changes the particle number by 1 , @xmath20 . in the latter systems , however , also larger changes in the particle number happen in the annihilation process , with @xmath21 for model 3 and @xmath22 for model 4 . as a consequence",
    ", loops in configuration space that connect a unit with constant @xmath19 with itself and that involve reactions will display an asymmetry in the number of creation and annihilation processes .",
    "thus for model 3 the smallest loop contains two creation processes and one annihilation .",
    "this effect is still present , even though in a weaker form , when we add the backreactions and end up with a microscopically reversible model like model 3 with a variable number of particles added or subtracted in the different reactions .",
    "it is this difference in the number of particles created in a creation process or destroyed in an annihilation event that yields contributions to the probability distributions which are not compensated in the fluctuation ratio .",
    "characterizing the out - of - equilibrium properties of interacting many - body systems remains one of the most challenging tasks in contemporary physics .",
    "the recent advent of exact fluctuation and work theorems yielded some excitement in the community as it indicated a possible way of characterizing large classes of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "in our work we try to characterize diffusion - limited reactions both in their nonequilibrium steady state and in the transient state when the systems are driven out of stationarity . for systems in their steady state we confirm the expectation that probability currents allow to distinguish between equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "in addition , they also allow to define a global quantity that quantifies the distance to equilibrium .",
    "this way of characterizing nonequilibrium steady systems remains valid even when microscopic reversibility is broken , as it is the case for many reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "the situation is more complicated if one wishes to characterize reaction - diffusion systems through fluctuation and work theorems .",
    "if one studies a system for which microscopic reversibility is fulfilled , one can define a work - like quantity , our quantity @xmath23 , see eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) , for which exact detailed fluctuation theorems not only hold in the steady states but are also valid when the system is driven out of stationarity through time dependent reaction rates . in absence of microscopic reversibility ,",
    "however , @xmath23 can not be used as it is no longer well defined .",
    "instead we propose to use the driving entropy production @xmath24 , see eq .",
    "( [ dphi ] ) , initially introduced in @xcite , as this quantity exclusively uses stationary probabilities and therefore remains well defined even in the absence of microscopic reversibility .",
    "whereas the driving entropy production always fulfills a global fluctuation theorem @xcite , it only fulfills a detailed fluctuation theorem for systems with equilibrium steady states . at first look",
    ", this seems to strongly reduce the usefulness of his quantity for the characterization of systems with nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "however , as we showed in this paper , the deviations of the fluctuation ratios for @xmath24 from a simple exponential behavior do contain non - trivial information on the trajectories in configuration space .",
    "indeed , in cases where the change in the number of particles is different for different reactions , we observe systematic deviations from a simple exponential behavior .",
    "these deviations , which take the form of peaks superimposed on an exponential , mainly result from trajectories in configuration space where exactly one reaction takes place .",
    "it is not an easy task to quantitatively relate the peak heights and the peak positions to the values of the system parameters . for this",
    ", a much more in - depth study is needed where all the parameters are varied in a systematic way @xcite .",
    "whereas the driving entropy production @xmath24 remains a well - defined quantity even in the absence of microscopic reversibility , we need to mention that in many cases this could be a quantity that is difficult to measure as the knowledge of the stationary probability distribution of the system is required . as a consequence , the practical importance of @xmath24 could be restricted , especially for experimental systems where the stationary probability distribution is often not easily accessible .",
    "how general are the results found in this work ? based on the reaction schemes discussed in this work and given in table [ table1 ] ,",
    "we expect the peaks to appear in the fluctuation ratios for @xmath24 for any reaction - diffusion system that allows for a variable number of particles to be created or destroyed in the different reactions .",
    "this also encompasses more complicated systems with two or more particle types .",
    "in addition , signatures of the same type should also be observed for other system classes with a configuration space topology that is similar to that of the the reaction - diffusion systems ( i.e. , composed by groups of configurations that are only connected in a very specific way ) and with a similar asymmetry in the configuration space trajectories .",
    "an extension of our work along these lines is planed for the future .",
    "we thank chris jarzynski and frdric van wijland for interesting and stimulating discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the us national science foundation through dmr-0904999 .",
    "in order to compute the probability distribution of @xmath24 , see ( [ dphi ] ) , when changing some rate @xmath7 from its initial value @xmath25 to the final value @xmath26 in @xmath27 steps , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , we first need to know the stationary probability distributions for any value @xmath30 .",
    "this is easily done by determining the null eigenvector of the liouville matrix .",
    "we then need to generate all possible sequences of configurations ( _ paths _ in configuration space ) @xmath31 , where only one reaction or diffusion takes place at every step . starting form every possible initial configuration , we have to built up a tree structure to all the configurations that can be reached in @xmath27 steps with non - zero probability .",
    "this is done recursively by a standard depth - first search algorithm that ends when we reach the @xmath27th step .",
    "we now have to attach a probability to every one of these generated paths . for this",
    "we are multiplying the probability to select the initial configuration @xmath32 with the product of the @xmath27 transition probabilities : @xmath33 having now determined every path and its probability , we need in addition the values of @xmath24 along these different paths , which we obtain through the equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the stationary probability to find the configuration @xmath1 at the value @xmath30 of the rate @xmath7 . putting everything together",
    ", the probability distribution is finally obtained through the expression @xmath36 in addition to the just described forward process we also study the reversed process where we start in configuration @xmath37 with the rate @xmath26 before changing the reaction rate in @xmath27 steps to its final value @xmath25 .",
    "the probability distribution for this process is then @xmath38 with @xmath39    in section iii we discuss not only the quantity @xmath24 but also the quantity @xmath23 defined by eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) .",
    "for this second quantity the procedure is exactly the same , only the calculation of the values of @xmath24 for the different paths has to be replaced by the values of @xmath23 .",
    "this numerical exact approach is limited to small system sizes @xmath10 and few steps @xmath27 , as the number of paths grows exponentially with both @xmath10 and @xmath27 , see fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath40 the number of paths increases from 404 for @xmath41 to 8.6 @xmath42 for @xmath43 ."
