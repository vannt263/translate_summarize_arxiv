    "this work is mainly devoted to the study of the length of bounded trajectories of the gradient flow of convex ( or quasiconvex ) functions in the plane .",
    "the motivation for this study comes from a well - known result due to s.  ojasiewicz ( see @xcite ) , asserting that if @xmath0 is a real - analytic function and @xmath1 is a critical point of @xmath2 , then there exist two constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that @xmath5 belonging to a neighborhood @xmath6 of @xmath7 .",
    "an immediate by - product is the finite length of the orbits of the gradient flow of @xmath2 lying in @xmath6 .",
    "the proof is straightforward using and is illustrated below : let @xmath8 be a gradient trajectory of  @xmath2 , that is , @xmath9 .",
    "then , @xmath10 = -\\langle \\dot\\gamma(t),\\nabla f(\\gamma(t)\\rangle \\ , f(\\gamma(t))^{-\\rho } = ||\\dot\\gamma(t)||^2 \\,f(\\gamma(t))^{-\\rho } \\geq c \\ , ||\\dot\\gamma(t)||,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yielding @xmath11 the aforementioned inequality has been extended by k.  kurdyka in  @xcite for @xmath12 functions belonging to an arbitrary o - minimal structure ( we refer to @xcite for the relevant definition ) , in a way that allows us again to deduce the finiteness of the lengths of the gradient orbits in this more general context . in @xcite and  @xcite , a further extension has been realized to encompass ( nonsmooth ) functions and orbits of the corresponding subgradient systems .",
    "it should be noted that in the above cases the functions enjoy an important structural property ( o - minimality ) and that , for general functions , there is no hope to prove a result like .",
    "a classical example of j.  palis and w.  de melo ( @xcite ) asserts that the bounded trajectories of the gradient flow of an arbitrary @xmath13 function need not converge ( in particular , they are of infinite length ) . in the aforementioned example",
    "the critical set of the function is not reduced to a singleton : in section  [ subsec:1 ] , we provide another example of a smooth function having a unique critical point towards which all corresponding orbits converge , but again are of infinite length .    the case when @xmath2 is a convex coercive function is particularly interesting in view of its potential impact in numerical optimization ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for example ) . but convex functions are far from being analytic and they do not satisfy neither the ojasiewicz inequality nor its generalized form established by kurdyka , unless a growth condition is assumed ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections  4.24.3 ) for a sufficient condition and a counter - example ) .",
    "nevertheless , their rigid structure makes it natural to think that the orbits of their gradient flow are of finite length .",
    "it is rather surprising that the answer of this question is not yet known in the literature except in some particular cases .",
    "let us mention that in the framework of hilbert spaces , this has been stated as an open problem by h.  brzis  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open problems , p.  167 ) . in infinite dimension , r.  bruck  @xcite proved that the ( sub)gradient orbits of convex coercive functions are converging towards a global minimizer of @xmath2 but this convergence holds only with respect to the weak topology .",
    "indeed , b.  baillon  @xcite constructed a counterexample of a lower semicontinuous convex function @xmath2 in a hilbert space whose gradient orbits do not converge for the norm topology .",
    "a straightforward consequence is that these orbits have infinite length .",
    "concurrently , there are some cases where a convex coercive function @xmath14 is known to have ( sub)gradient orbits of finite length .",
    "this is true when the set of minimizers of @xmath2 has nonempty interior in the hilbert space @xmath15 ( see h.  brzis  @xcite ) , or whenever @xmath2 satisfies a growth condition . for a detailed discussion and the proofs of these facts",
    ", we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 - 4 ) .",
    "the aforementioned results do not cover the simplest case of a convex smooth function defined in the plane and having a unique minimum .",
    "one of the main results of this work is to prove the following :    [ thm - intro - convex ] let @xmath16 be a smooth convex function with a unique minimum .",
    "then , the trajectories  @xmath17 of the gradient system @xmath18 have a finite length .",
    "the proof of this result does not use the whole convexity of @xmath2 but , instead , rather relies on the convexity of its level - sets .",
    "more precisely , the conclusion of theorem  [ thm - intro - convex ] remains also true for the orbits of the gradient flow of a quasiconvex function ( see corollary  [ corollary_quasiconvex ] ) .    actually , both results will follow as consequences of a much more general result ( theorem  [ theorem_main ] ) about bounded _",

    "let us finally mention that , even if gradient orbits of convex functions have finite length in the plane , they do not enjoy all the properties of the gradient orbits of real - analytic functions .",
    "indeed , on the one hand , the so - called thom conjecture for the gradient orbits of real - analytic functions holds true : if @xmath29 denotes the limit of the orbit @xmath30 , then the secants @xmath31 converge towards a fixed direction of the unit sphere ( see k.  kurdyka , t.  mostowski and a.  parusinski @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as we show in section  [ subsec:2 ] , an analogous result fails in the convex case .",
