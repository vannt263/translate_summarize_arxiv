    "we have implemented the results into computer programs , that are available on the web at ` http://theory.fnal.gov/people/afreitas/ ` .",
    "[ technical information on installing and running the programs are given at this web site . ]    a self - consistent analysis of the susy sector at the expected experimental precision will eventually have to take into account the impact of the parameters of all susy sectors in the theoretical predictions at the loop level . accordingly , a coherent study of many different channels in parallel  sleptons , charginos / neutralinos and squarks / gluinos  has to be performed @xcite .",
    "such a comprehensive study is currently pursued in the context of the spa project  @xcite , and will ultimately establish the access to the fundamental supersymmetric theory and its microscopic breaking mechanism at potentially high scales .",
