    "x - ray emission from accretion disks around compact objects often shows high - frequency flickering in the form of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) .",
    "several galactic binaries containing black holes show pairs of qpo of fixed , relatively high frequencies having ratios very close to 3:2 @xcite . these include gro j1655 - 40 with 300 and 450 hz qpo @xcite ; xte j1550 - 564 with 184 and 276 hz @xcite ; grs 1915 + 105 with 113 and 168 hz @xcite ; and h1743 - 322 with 165 and 240 hz @xcite .",
    "the origin of these quasi - periodic oscillations is still unclear .",
    "one possibility is that orbiting blobs or hot spots follow non - circular orbits whose epicyclic frequencies are related to the observed frequencies ( stella , vietri & morsink 1999 ) .",
    "this model has been investigated in detail by @xcite and @xcite , who use a ray - tracing code to model the power spectrum of light curve variations .",
    "the model has two serious shortcomings .",
    "first , special orbits must be chosen by hand ( e.g. , the radii of the nearly circular orbits ) to produce the correct frequencies , so this model lacks predictive power .",
    "moreover , the blobs can persist only a few rotation periods before being sheared apart by differential rotation .",
    "another model that can reproduce a 3:2 frequency ratio is the relativistic torus model of @xcite . to produce the 3:2 ratio",
    ", the model requires a black hole spin close to maximal .",
    "the actual value of frequency depends on the radial extent of the torus .",
    "this is a free parameter of the model , which therefore also lacks predictive power .    the fixed frequencies and 3:2 ratio of these qpo pairs suggests that they may represent nonlinearly driven resonant frequencies in the curved spacetime around the black hole ( abramowicz & kluniak 2001 ; rebusco 2004 ; lee , abramowicz & kluniak 2004 )",
    "this idea has been studied using a mathematical model for parametric resonance but has not yet been shown to arise automatically from nonlinear dynamics in general relativity .",
    "another possible explanation for the fixed frequencies of high - frequency qpo is diskoseismic waves similar to helioseismic @xmath0-modes @xcite .",
    "this model has the advantage of predicting a discrete set of frequencies .",
    "however , a frequency ratio of 3:2 only obtains for a few particular values of the black hole spin that are unlikely to obtain for all observed systems .",
    "thus , similarly to the hot spot model , this model requires tuning of parameters .",
    "the models can be classified as to whether the oscillating structures are particle - like ( blobs , with or without resonant interactions ) or wave - like ( oscillating tori , diskoseismic waves ) .",
    "blob models are in many respects the simplest , as the only important physics is gravity .",
    "it is natural to ask whether a similarly simple description is possible for waves .    in this paper",
    "we show that waves in an accretion disk can also be described using simple kinematics in curved spacetime .",
    "we investigate nearly kinematic density waves , which are waves of compression and rarefaction of particles freely orbiting in a disk .",
    "these density waves are very similar to the density waves which underlie the lin - shu hypothesis of galaxy spiral structure , apart from several important differences .",
    "our model neglects self - gravity , pressure , magnetic stresses , and all forces except the gravity of the central compact object . a kinematic model of perturbations in thin accretion disks around kerr black holes",
    "was considered in @xcite .",
    "however , they allow for fluid streamlines to intersect forming shocks , as we will describe below .    early models for galactic spiral structure ( lindblad 1957 , kalnajs 1973 ) failed to predict sufficiently long - lived patterns because differential rotation relatively quickly winds up material arms ; moreover , these models neglected self - gravity which is invalid for galactic disks ( toomre 1977 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "however , accretion disks around black holes contain relatively much less mass than their central `` bulge '' , so self - gravity is much less important . if other forces are unimportant  as might be expected for a thin disk  then the remaining challenge is to prevent the waves from becoming tightly wound in a short time .",
    "this is exactly the problem considered in the galactic context by @xcite .",
    "our model is a generalization of his kinematic density waves to arbitrary potentials and to the strongly curved spacetime around a kerr black hole .",
    "we choose to investigate a thin disk , since it is analytically tractable . in this case pressure forces are not important ,",
    "otherwise the disk would not remain very thin . for consistency",
    ", shocks must not form in the gas .",
    "thus the perturbations must evolve so that fluid streamlines avoid intersections .",
    "the boundary between regions where streamlines cross and where they do not is a caustic surface .",
    "our model attempts to find long - lived kinematic density waves free from caustics .",
    "in order to study the dynamics of thin accretion disks , we will perturb an initially stationary and axisymmetric thin disk and then impose the condition that particle trajectories do not intersect .",
    "the surface number density is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the radius of an unperturbed orbit .",
    "this assumes that the effective potential is axisymmetric and each orbit has a conserved angular momentum as well as energy .",
    "perturbations are added using the lagrangian framework based on individual particle trajectories .",
    "thus , at each instant of time , there exists a nonlinear mapping that takes the coordinates of a particle in the unperturbed disk to the coordinates of the same particle in a perturbed disk .",
    "we choose to map the lagrangian coordinates ( which we choose to call @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) of the particles in the unperturbed disk to the eulerian spherical coordinates ( @xmath4 ) of the same particles in the perturbed disk ; @xmath5 for the unperturbed disk .",
    "thus , the map is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are functions we will parameterize below .",
    "we require the mapping to be smooth and single - valued so that there are no intersections of particle orbits , which would lead to shock waves and invalidate our assumption that the disk remains cold and thin .",
    "in other words , the perturbed disk is given by a diffeomorphism of the unperturbed disk .",
    "the number density @xmath10 of the perturbed disk follows from the transformation of the disk area element @xmath11 . in the absence of intersecting orbits ,",
    "the number of particles @xmath12 contained in each surface element is constant : @xmath13 .",
    "the surface number density of the perturbed disk is then given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is an area element in the unperturbed disk .",
    "the requirement that no intersections occur translates as a condition on @xmath11 : @xmath16 .",
    "if the disk perturbations were coplanar displacements in flat space , the ratio @xmath17 would be a simple jacobian determinant .",
    "however , the displacements are ( in general ) three - dimensional and we allow for space curvature .",
    "thus a more careful calculation of the area element is needed .",
    "we do this using an orthonormal basis constructed on slices of constant coordinate time ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the line element on each time slice is @xmath19 , where the hatted indices give the components of a vector in the orthonormal basis and latin indices are summed over the spatial components ( with positive signature ) . here , @xmath20 are the spatial components of the full spacetime metric .",
    "orthonormal and coordinate components of three - vectors are related by a triad @xmath21 : @xmath22 . from the invariance of @xmath23",
    ", we find that @xmath24 . for a diagonal spatial metric @xmath20 ( i.e. , an orthogonal coordinate basis ) we can orient the triad so that its only non - zero components are @xmath25 ( no summation ) . throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", we will assume that the spatial metric is diagonal ( as it is for the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates ) .",
    "let us call the three spatial coordinates @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the usual equatorial surface .",
    "the components of the infinitesimal displacement vector @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30 , in the right - handed coordinate basis @xmath31 are @xmath32 . using the triad ,",
    "the vector components in the orthonormal basis to point in the @xmath33 direction ] @xmath34 are therefore given by @xmath35 the factors @xmath36 in general can be functions of @xmath26 .",
    "every vector is associated with a point @xmath26 in the perturbed disk and @xmath37 in the unperturbed disk .",
    "let us construct two displacement vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 whose origin is the point @xmath40 in the plane of the unperturbed disk as follows , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and analogously for @xmath43 . under the diffeomorphism ( [ coo ] ) , we find that the vectors are mapped to @xmath44 note that the origin of the vectors is changed under the map , and therefore @xmath45 are no longer barred .",
    "the area of the parallelogram in the unperturbed disk formed by @xmath38 and @xmath39 is given by @xmath46 .",
    "this parallelogram is mapped under ( [ coo ] ) to a parallelogram with area @xmath47 .",
    "note the vector @xmath48 is normal to the perturbed disk .",
    "thus , we have @xmath49 and therefore , from ( [ nn0 ] ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the jacobian of any functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in order to avoid caustics",
    ", we must impose that @xmath54 in the disk at each moment in time .",
    "for the spacetimes of interest , the triad factors @xmath36 are nonzero in the disk , implying that at least one of the three differential inequalities @xmath55 must always be satisfied at each point of the disk . in order to systematically solve these inequalities",
    ", we will work in the epicyclic approximation . throughout the rest of the paper",
    "we will assume that @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not vanish in the plane of the disk .",
    "for a generic potential the trajectories of test particles will not form closed non - circular orbits at all radii .",
    "since we want to avoid intersections of the particle orbits , any deformation we make to the orbits in the disk must be a perturbation to a circular orbit . in this case",
    "we can use the epicyclic approximation , in which radial and vertical perturbations are harmonic oscillations with coordinate frequencies @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . in this approximation , to first order in the perturbations @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the map ( [ coo ] ) can be written as    [ epic ] @xmath63\\ ,    \\label{epicr}\\\\    \\phi(t)&=&p(\\bar r,\\bar\\phi;t)=\\bar \\phi+\\phi_0(\\bar r,\\bar\\phi )      + \\omega_\\phi(\\bar r)t+\\beta(\\bar r)\\epsilon(\\bar r,\\phi )      \\sin[\\omega_r(\\bar r)t+\\chi(\\bar r,\\phi)]\\ ,    \\label{epicphi}\\\\    \\theta(t)&=&t(\\bar r,\\bar\\phi;t)=\\bar\\theta-\\gamma(\\bar      r,\\phi)\\cos[\\omega_\\theta(\\bar r)t+\\zeta(\\bar      r,\\phi)]\\ .\\label{epictheta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the horizontal epicycles have amplitude @xmath61 and phase @xmath64 ; the vertical epicycles have amplitude @xmath62 and phase @xmath65 ; in addition the azimuthal position is perturbed by @xmath66 .",

    "it s worth noting that in writing equations ( [ epic ] ) we are neglecting time - independent perturbations that arise from deforming one circular orbit into another .",
    "we could account for them simply by modifying the unperturbed disk . in our linearized treatment",
    "such perturbations are uninteresting because they cause no time variability .    in equations ( [ epic ] )",
    "we used the variable @xmath74\\times$ ] @xmath75 $ ] , which can be solved iteratively for @xmath76 , but such a solution is not necessary for our calculation .",
    "this expression can be rewritten using ( [ epicphi ] ) as @xmath77\\ .\\ ] ] the variables @xmath78 give the original coordinates of particles in the perturbed disk .",
    "the choice of functional dependence of the perturbation functions on @xmath76 will allow us to write @xmath79 and @xmath80 as functions of the mixed coordinates @xmath81 which will give the correct caustic structure provided that a certain initial condition is satisfied , as we will show below .",
    "the eulerian coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath83 at fixed @xmath84 must be periodic in @xmath67 . therefore , using ( [ epic ] ) we obtain    [ periodic ] @xmath85 @xmath86    for any integer @xmath87 .",
    "the function @xmath88 appearing in the two places above need not be one and the same , but we used the same symbol to economize notation . since the perturbation functions must be smooth , this implies that @xmath88 depends only on @xmath87 , and not on @xmath2 or @xmath84 for instance .    in the epicyclic approximation ( [ epic ] ) , for any two functions @xmath89 and",
    "@xmath90 we obtain @xmath91\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we do not want @xmath51 to become zero , hence we require @xmath92 .",
    "this requires that the initial conditions in the perturbed disk are such that the angle @xmath93 is a function of @xmath94 , otherwise from ( [ epic ] ) we see that the map will no longer be one - to - one , which in turn would lead to caustics in the initial conditions .",
    "since this term is time independent , once these initial conditions are satisfied , the zeros of @xmath51 and @xmath95 will coincide .",
    "thus , @xmath96 is a sufficient condition to justify our usage of @xmath78 to label the particles in the disk .    in complete analogy as above",

    "having developed the necessary background for kinematic density waves in possibly warped disks in flat or curved spacetime , we now ask whether there exist perturbations that last many orbital times before orbits intersect .",
    "we will find in general that orbits always intersect eventually in the absence of pressure or other non - gravitational forces .",
    "however , some patterns last many orbital times .",
    "we begin the examination in this section with perturbations that leave the disk flat .",
    "perturbations in the plane of the disk satisfy @xmath105 .",
    "thus , from ( [ r ] ) we see that to avoid caustics we need @xmath106 .",
    "let us write the jacobian of the two functions @xmath107 $ ] in terms of the jacobian of the functions @xmath108 $ ] defined by composition with @xmath109 . with @xmath76 as the angular variable",
    "the calculation simplifies somewhat as the unknown function @xmath110 is eliminated .    using ( [ epicr ] ) , ( [ epicphi ] ) and ( [ jacfinal ] )",
    "we can obtain @xmath111 .",
    "the jacobian has many terms , and to simplify things note that from ( [ periodic ] ) , the derivatives of all perturbation functions with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath76 are periodic in @xmath76 . also , we have to drop all terms proportional to @xmath112 , since our approximation does not conserve angular momentum at this order .",
    "however , this does not imply that we can drop terms such as @xmath113 and @xmath114 since the derivatives need not be small .    at @xmath115",
    "the jacobian evaluates to @xmath116 all partial derivatives with respect to @xmath2 are taken holding @xmath76 constant . in order to avoid caustics in the perturbed disk",
    "initially we require @xmath117 everywhere which will be satisfied if @xmath118 similarly , to avoid caustics forming within an orbit time it is sufficient to require @xmath119 if we assume that @xmath120 and the inequalities ( [ rders ] ) and ( [ phiders ] ) are strongly satisfied , then at late times the jacobian becomes @xmath121\\ , \\ ] ] where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath2 , e.g. @xmath122 , and @xmath123    to avoid intersection of orbits we require @xmath124 . at late times",
    "this requires @xmath125 these conditions may be integrated to give @xmath126 and @xmath127 where @xmath128 is an integration constant . from ( [ nperiod ] ) , the first condition implies @xmath129 is an integer .",
    "thus , to maximize the chance of having long - lasting waves we restrict perturbations to have the following form : @xmath130 the two functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 specify the planar perturbations .    from ( [ pertr ] )",
    "we see that the first of conditions ( [ nocaus ] ) can not be satisfied everywhere in the disk because @xmath133 is a function of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , intersections will inevitably occur : it is impossible to have an infinite - lived kinematic density wave except for special power - law potentials like kepler and the simple harmonic oscillator",
    ". however , the timescale for caustic formation can be made arbitrarily large if one restricts perturbations to small neighborhoods around the discrete radii @xmath134 such that @xmath135 .",
    "thus we consider a perturbation @xmath131 which is negligible everywhere except over a range @xmath136 about @xmath134 . from ( [ jrp ] ) and ( [ pertr ] ) ,",
    "the perturbation lifetime until caustic formation is @xmath137 in linear perturbation theory , @xmath136 should be interpreted as @xmath138 , i.e.  the initial displacement of the unperturbed disk .",
    "however , it is more accurate to evaluate the orbital frequencies at the displaced position , in which case one can regard @xmath136 as the maximum of the amplitude @xmath139 and the width @xmath138 of the perturbation field @xmath140 ( which might be , for example , a gaussian centered at @xmath134 ) .    thus , we have found relatively long - lived perturbations around discrete radii @xmath134 satisfying @xmath141 integer . combining ( [ epic ] ) , ( [ phit ] ) , and ( [ pertr ] ) we find that to first order in @xmath61 the perturbations have the form : @xmath142 , \\ \\    \\omega_m(\\bar r)\\equiv\\omega_r(\\bar r)-m\\omega_\\phi(\\bar r)\\ .\\ ] ] this perturbation represents an @xmath143-armed spiral and @xmath144 is called the modulation speed .. the corresponding pattern speed is @xmath145 .",

    "the modulation frequency of the spiral is @xmath149 , which is the frequency for an arm - to - arm displacement .",
    "note that @xmath150 at @xmath151 ; the modulation speed has an extremum at the radii of long - lived perturbations .    in order to produce observable modulation ,",
    "the pattern must not only survive against intersections , it must also not be too tightly wound .",
    "if , for fixed @xmath67 and @xmath84 , @xmath152 oscillates rapidly in the radial direction , the light curve will show little modulation .",
    "significant modulation can persist only for a winding - up timescale defined by the condition that the argument of the cosine in ( [ rsol ] ) change by less than @xmath153 as @xmath82 changes for fixed @xmath67 and @xmath84 . at arbitrary @xmath2 , this gives the condition @xmath154+\\eta'\\delta\\bar r|<2\\pi$ ] . at @xmath155 , @xmath156 and the lifetime against winding",
    "is ( if @xmath157 is neglected ) @xmath158 the long lifetime has a simple interpretation . if the pattern speed @xmath159 is constant over a range of radii , a density wave located over that range will remain constant in the frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath160 , hence will avoid winding up . note that if @xmath161 ( larger @xmath61 is forbidden by the requirement @xmath162 ) , the timescales for winding up and caustic formation are comparable ; in general winding up precedes caustic formation .",
    "had we retained nonzero @xmath157 , the winding up would have been faster on one side of @xmath151 and slower on the other .      in order to see",
    "whether the spiral arms are leading or trailing , we need to find the sign of @xmath163 evaluated along the spiral arms .",
    "thus , we first find the initial spiral arm positions .",
    "these follow from the extrema of @xmath164 . from ( [ jrp0 ] ) and ( [ pertr ] ) , setting @xmath165 to maximize the perturbation lifetime , we obtain @xmath166 setting the gradient to zero gives conditions for extrema : @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "for generic @xmath61 and @xmath169 this corresponds to the loci : ( 1 ) @xmath170 and @xmath171 ; and ( 2 ) @xmath172 and @xmath173 ; where @xmath174 is an integer . from the second partial derivatives we find that the first locus corresponds to saddle points in the density , while the second corresponds to overdensities if @xmath175 and @xmath176 at these points .",
    "if the signs are reversed , then we would have underdensities ; and if the signs are mixed then we have a saddle .",
    "an example of this result is given in the first snapshot of figure [ fig : disk ] for the @xmath177 mode in the kerr metric .",
    "there we have a gaussian @xmath131 for which we obtain four minima and four maxima in the density . if at each radius we maximize @xmath178 with respect to @xmath76 , we find that initially the spiral arms are radial segments lying at @xmath173 .",
    "thus , there are @xmath179 overdensities for the mode with azimuthal number @xmath147 .",
    "the pattern makes a @xmath153 revolution with a period @xmath180 , which implies that @xmath181 along the spiral arms .",
    "since we need only the sign of @xmath182 , we can work to zeroth order in @xmath61 .",
    "the sense of winding up of each spiral arm is then given by @xmath183 thus , assuming that @xmath184 is monotonic across the perturbation , we can conclude that overdensities which lie inside @xmath134 have opposite sense of winding than those lying outside .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier result that the pattern speed changes sign across the radii @xmath134 .",
    "this behavior is exemplified figure [ fig : disk ] for the @xmath177 mode in the kerr metric .",
    "leading waves correspond to a pattern speed increasing with radius , or @xmath185 .",

    "the reason is that when @xmath260 the pattern frequency is determined by the radial oscillation frequency , while for the rest of the modes @xmath144 is determined mainly by @xmath262 .     in the kerr metric .",

    "@xcite show that the lower of the two frequencies is approximately 1860 @xmath247 hz for these systems , too small to be consistent with the modulation frequencies of figure [ fig : fm ] for @xmath264 .",
    "this is a shame , given that the frequency ratios for @xmath177 and @xmath265 have nearly a 3:2 ratio over a wide range of black hole spin .",
    "thus , the simplest model of kinematic density waves fails to account for the black hole high - frequency qpos .    our results for the pattern speed and @xmath134 of the @xmath147-th mode",
    "exactly reproduce the frequency and radius of the same g - mode as derived in the diskoseismology model of @xcite in the pressureless limit ( cf . our figure [ fig : fm ] and their figure 5 ) . in the limit of large vertical mode number ,",
    "the frequency difference between our and the diskoseismic result is proportional to the sound speed and the radial mode number , and is inversely proportional to the vertical mode number [ as indicated in @xcite , equation ( 5.3 ) ] .",
    "since we consider only pressureless disks , we recover no analogs of p- and c - modes . however , our analysis of g - modes in pressureless disks is valid for generic potentials , and it allows for the interpretation of the perturbations as kinematic density spiral arms , as well as for the visualization of the patterns that form in the disk .",
    "thus , we are able to see that the @xmath147-th mode has @xmath179 overdensities ( see below ) resulting from pure kinematics , which might double the expected frequency of the x - ray modulations .",
    "this result has been missed by the diskoseismic models .",
    "the reason for that is that in the diskoseismic analysis , @xcite assume a time dependence of the lagrangian perturbations of the form @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is independent of @xmath2 . comparing this with our equation ( [ epicr ] ) ,",
    "we can read off the @xmath268 for the diskoseismic models : @xmath269 thus , the choice of time dependence in the diskoseismic analysis breaks the epicyclic approximation after a timescale of @xmath270 which is @xmath271 times shorter than the lifetime of the perturbations that we find . in the pressureless limit , nothing can break the validity of the epicyclic approximation . in the diskoseismic models",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the radial width of the perturbations vanishes in that limit .",
    "therefore , our result generalizes the result of the diskoseismic models for pressureless disks by allowing for transients and maximizing their lifetimes .     around a kerr black hole with a spin parameter @xmath272 .",
    "time advances from left to right and top to bottom .",
    "the dark circle shows the circle where @xmath273 , i.e. @xmath274 .",

    "the spiral pattern is formed by a small - amplitude perturbation in the plane , as described in the text . since the perturbation is nonzero only in an extremely thin annulus around the black hole , we have cut out the central portions of the disk for clarity .",
    "thus , the center of the polar plot does not correspond to @xmath200 , but to @xmath276 , and the plot extends to @xmath277 .",
    "the last two snapshots already have formed caustics . note that although @xmath177 , there are in fact 4 overdense regions because the waves are leading inside @xmath278 and trailing outside @xmath278.,width=302 ]    to illustrate the kinematics of the planar density waves , in figure [ fig : disk ] we plot the @xmath177 spiral pattern for several times .",
    "the initial perturbation was chosen with @xmath279 and @xmath280 $ ] , with @xmath281 .",
    "the arm - to - arm displacement period is 0.87 ms .",
    "the timestep between the snapshots is 9.3 s , and we have made it to be an exact multiple of the pattern frequency .",
    "therefore , the pattern appears stationary , although it rotates counterclockwise .",
    "the winding - up timescale is about 30 s , and the caustic - formation timescale is about 1 minute .",
    "we ran similar calculations for a set of perturbations with different @xmath147 , @xmath71 , @xmath61 and @xmath128 , and we found that our analytical estimates for the winding - up timescale and the lifetime of the pattern are consistent with the numerical results .",
    "figure [ fig : disk ] verifies the analytic expectations of section 4.2 .",
    "we see that for @xmath165 the spiral pattern for a mode with mode number @xmath147 has @xmath179 overdense regions  @xmath143 trailing waves on the outer edge of the perturbation and @xmath143 leading waves on the inner edge in agreement with equation ( [ leadtrail ] ) .",
    "if these overdensities produce comparable modulation of the intensity , then an observer would see a modulation at a frequency @xmath282 , exacerbating the problem of matching kinematic density waves to observed black hole qpos .",
    "if simple density waves can not explain the observed qpos , maybe a beat frequency between an orbiting blob and density waves can do the job .",
    "consider a blob of gas orbiting the black hole near @xmath134 with angular frequency @xmath283 .",
    "it must be small and dense enough not to be tidally sheared apart .",
    "for @xmath284 the spiral arms will rotate faster than the blob around the disk and thus the blob will be compressed every time the spiral waves pass over it .",
    "this leads to a beat frequency in the emission from the blob given by @xmath285 , i.e.  the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "while the blob remains on one side of @xmath134 , its beats lead to a flickering frequency of @xmath286 .",
    "if the blob straddles @xmath134 hence is overtaken by both leading and trailing density waves , the flickering frequency is @xmath287 .",
    "the radial frequency @xmath286 is plotted in figure [ fig : fr ] .",
    "the radial frequency in the kerr metric is less than the azimuthal frequency and goes to zero at the isco ( corresponding to modes with @xmath252 ) .",
    "this frequency is too low to account for high - frequency qpos , even if it is doubled .",
    "maybe the black hole mass estimates are in error .",
    "if so , the predicted frequencies are wrong but frequency ratios are robust . thus in figure",
    "[ fig : frat ] we plot all frequency ratios of low-@xmath147 modes that are close to 1.5 .",
    "both the density wave modulation frequencies @xmath288 and the radial ( blob - wave beat ) frequencies @xmath286 are included .",
    "the only ratios that come close to 1.5 are the pairs with @xmath265 and @xmath177 .",
    "however , the density wave frequencies are too high ( the lower frequency is at least 2500 hz for one solar mass ) and the beat frequencies are too low ( the lower frequency is less than 420 hz or 840 hz if it is doubled ) compared with the observed range 1100 to 2000 hz . the nearest frequency match occurs for spiral density waves with @xmath177 for @xmath289 , which would require that the black hole masses be about 25% larger than the upper range of observational estimates . for grs 1915 + 105 , for example , the lower 113 hz qpo could be explained by @xmath290 if the black hole mass were 22 @xmath291 .",
    "the frequency ratio @xmath292 is close to @xmath293 .",
    "however , the spiral density wave model also predicts modulation at frequencies twice as high ( from the combination of inner leading and outer trailing arms ) , which has not been seen .    for completeness we present in figure [ fig : tauw ] the lifetimes of various modes to winding up .",
    "the lifetimes must be at least 10 times the inverse frequency in order that mode decay not broaden the peaks in the power spectrum to a lower @xmath294 value than is observed . however , this condition is very easily satisfied for modes concentrated near the discrete radii @xmath134 .",
    "the broadening of the timing peaks is probably not due to finite mode lifetime unless the modes extend in radius a significant fraction of the distance to the next discrete mode radius @xmath134 .",
    "in addition to the beating of a blob with a wave , one might consider the nonlinear interaction between waves of different pattern speeds .",
    "however , this leads nowhere because the pattern ( or modulation ) speed is a function of radius , and spiral density waves of different mode number have different frequencies only because they are localized at different radii .",
    "the application to kerr has until now considered only planar perturbations .",
    "vertical perturbations can also be excited and are long - lived when concentrated at the discrete radii @xmath228 such that @xmath295 . for the kerr metric",
    "there are only two solutions outside the isco :    1 .   for @xmath296",
    "there exists a solution with @xmath297 at @xmath298 .",
    "the frequencies are @xmath299 khz , with a winding - up timescale of about @xmath300 min for @xmath301 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath302",
    "there exists a second solution with @xmath303 at @xmath304 .",
    "the frequencies are @xmath305 khz , @xmath306 khz , with a winding - up timescale of about @xmath307 min for @xmath308 .    because these modes occur outside the isco only for @xmath309 close to maximal , the mode radii and frequencies are nearly constant over the small range of black hole spin where they exist . given the very narrow range of spins for which these long - lived warps exist , and given their very high frequencies , they are likely to be observationally unimportant .    at larger radii and for smaller black hole spins ,",
    "the lifetime of vertical waves becomes relatively large even though @xmath133 and @xmath254 are not integers .",
    "to order of magnitude the winding time multiplied by mode frequency is @xmath310 and similarly for the vertical modes .",
    "also , the horizontal and modulation frequencies become comparable : for the same mode number , @xmath311 for radii corresponding to pattern frequencies in the range @xmath312 hz to @xmath313 hz ( multiplied by @xmath247 ) .",
    "this frequency range includes the low - frequency qpos seen in the soft power - law state of black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "the qpo frequency varies with x - ray flux , implying that the modulation does not arise at a fixed radius ( unlike the high - frequency qpos ) .",
    "one explanation for the low - fequency qpos is lense - thirring precession ( stella et al .  1999 ,",
    "schnittman et al .  2006 ) , with modulation speed @xmath314 . at large radii ,",
    "@xmath315 , so vertical density waves with @xmath230 are long - lived and have pattern speed equal to @xmath316 . however , planar perturbations have @xmath317 and are comparably long - lived .",
    "therefore , either planar ( spiral waves ) or vertical waves ( warps ) are candidate explanations for low - frequency qpos , and they have practically the same frequencies and lifetimes . instead of having no density wave solution consistent with observations ( the situation for high - frequency qpos ) ,",
    "the low - frequency qpos have a plethora of kinematic solutions with little to distinguish them .",
    "starting with a simple kinematical consideration  fluid streamlines should not intersect  we were able to classify all long - lived linear perturbations in pressureless thin accretion disks in generic potentials including the kerr metric .",
    "the result is a set of patterns ( planar spiral arms , vertical warps , and linear combinations ) whose mode functions are concentrated at discrete radii satisfying a simple condition : the pattern frequency for non  self - intersecting orbits must be approximately constant over a range of radii , i.e.  its derivative with respect to radius must vanish .",
    "this condition automatically picks out discrete set of frequencies for modes with a long lifetime against winding up .",
    "the lifetimes are @xmath318 oscillation periods where @xmath136 is the radial extent of the mode .",
    "although our treatment neglected pressure , the results are in excellent agreement with the diskoseismic @xmath0-modes investigated by @xcite , when the sound speed is much less than the orbital speed .",
    "our treatment , based on the epicyclic approximation , is much simpler than the solution of the relativistic fluid equations .",
    "one of our goals was to investigate the possibility of explaining the @xmath319 ratio in high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations observed in accreting black hole binaries .",
    "our model gives several mode pairs with a frequency ratio close to 1.5 for a wide range of black hole spin .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the discrete radii at which the spiral patterns exist .",
    "however , we can not recover naturally the correct frequencies unless the black hole mass estimates are seriously in error .",
    "planar spiral density waves have frequencies too high , while the beat frequency between a blob and these waves is too low , compared with the observed frequencies .",
    "moreover , the best matches follow for modes with @xmath320 and @xmath321 , with no explanation for the failure to observe the mode with @xmath322 .    because our analysis classified all long - lived perturbations of pressureless disks , the failure to reproduce the observed high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations implies that pressure or other non - gravitational forces ( e.g.  magnetic stresses or radiation pressure ) must be important in producing the qpos .",
    "based on the diskoseismic results , we would expect that small non - gravitational forces do not significantly change the mode frequencies .",
    "large non - gravitational forces would thicken the disk and might destroy the coherence and longevity of modes , although this remains to be seen .",
    "even so , some mechanism is needed to pick out discrete frequencies of the high - frequency qpos .",
    "these results make more attractive the possibility that nonlinear coupling between modes , e.g.  parametric resonance , is responsible for selecting the frequency ratios ( abramowicz & kluniak 2001 ; rebusco 2004 ) .",
    "one approach to investigating this process is to carry the perturbation methods of the current paper to one higher order , to include a coupling between radial and vertical oscillations ."
