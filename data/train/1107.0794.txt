    "quantum computation stems from a simple observation@xcite : any computation is ultimately performed on a physical device ; to any input - output relation there must correspond a change in the state of the device .",
    "if the device is microscopic , then its evolution is ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics . + the question of whether the change of evolution rules can lead to a breakthrough in computational complexity theory is still unanswered @xcite .",
    "what is known is that a quantum computer would outperform a classical one in specific tasks such as integer factorization @xcite and searching an unordered database @xcite .",
    "in fact , grover s algorithm can search a keyword quadratically faster than any classical algorithm , whereas in the case of shor s factorization the speedup is exponential .",

    "+ nonetheless , quantum computation is nowadays an active research field and represents a fascinating example of two way communication between computer science and quantum physics .",
    "on one side , computer science used quantum mechanics to define a new computational model , on the other the language of information and complexity theory has allowed a sharper understanding of some aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "+ moreover , it is clear that quantum mechanics will sooner or later force its way into our classical computing devices : intel@xmath5 has recently ( feb 2010 ) announced the first 25 nm nand logical gate : 500 bohr radii .",
    "+ in this paper we present an introduction to quantum adiabatic computation and quantum annealing , or quantum stochastic optimization , representing , respectively , a quantum and a quantum - inspired optimization algorithm . in section [ sec : transition ] we introduce the class of problems that are hard for a quantum computer .",
    "we consider the problem 3-sat , its mapping into a quantum problem and the quantum adiabatic technique . in section [ sec : qa ] we describe quantum annealing , a classical algorithm which captures the features of the quantum ground state process to provide good heuristics for combinatorial problems .",
    "section [ sec : dissipation ] is devoted to dissipative quantum annealing and to the presentation of preliminary heuristic results on the dynamics of a dissipative system .",
    "concluding remarks and possible lines of future research are presented in the last section .",
    "the need of considering the features of quantum computing devices led to the definition of the quantum counterpart of some classical complexity classes .",
    "quantum algorithms are intrinsically probabilistic , since the result of the measurement of an observable of a quantum system is a random variable .",
    "not surprisingly , the quantum correspondent of p is bqp ( bounded - error quantum polynomial - time ) , the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a quantum turing machine , with error probability at most 1/3 .",
    "+ qma ( quantum merlin arthur ) is the quantum counterpart of the class np@xcite .",
    "it is defined as the class of decision problems such that a `` yes '' answer can be verified by a 1-message quantum interactive proof .",
    "that is : a quantum state ( the `` proof '' ) is given to a bqp ( i.e. quantum polynomial - time ) verifier .",
    "we require that if the answer to the decision problem is `` yes '' then there exists a state such that the verifier accepts with probability at least 2/3 ; if the answer is `` no '' then for _ all states _ the verifier rejects with probability at least 2/3 .",
    "+ all the known complete problems for the class qma are promise problems , i.e. decision problems where the input is promised to belong to a subset of all possible inputs .",

    "given an assignment @xmath24 , the function @xmath25 will return 0 if the clause @xmath16 is satisfied , 1 otherwise .",
    "+ the cost @xmath26 of an assignment can be defined therefore in terms of the functions @xmath25 as : @xmath27 that is the total number of violated clauses .",
    "an instance of @xmath6-sat is therefore satisfiable if there exists a configuration of zero cost .",
    "+ the translation of a @xmath6-sat problem to the corresponding @xmath6-local hamiltonian , problem is straightforward .",
    "+ to each variable @xmath19 we assign a _ qubit _ ,",
    "i.e. a 2-level quantum system . for the sake of definiteness",
    "we will consider spins @xmath28 , @xmath29 and their component @xmath30 along the @xmath31 axis of a given reference frame as computational direction .",
    "furthermore , we decide that if an assignment assigns the value 1 ( @xmath32 ) to the variable @xmath19 then the corresponding qubit is in the state @xmath33 ( spin up ) and in the state @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "+ to each clause we associate the hamiltonian term : @xmath35 which acts non trivially only on @xmath6 qubits .",
    "the total hamiltonian : @xmath36 is @xmath6-local and plays the role of a cost function : if an assignment satisfies all the clauses simultaneously then the corresponding energy is zero .",

    "+ though these results do not prove that 3-sat is qma - complete , they hint nevertheless that 3-sat is hard for quantum computers as well .",
    "recent studies focused on determining _ why _ 3-qsat has instances which are hard for adiabatic quantum computation and what general features they possess .",
    "the idea is to use typical , but not necessarily worst , random cases with a specific density of clauses @xmath71 ( @xmath0 number of clauses , @xmath2 number of variables ) and to investigate how @xmath60 varies ( on the average ) as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite and references therein .",
    "so far we discussed if and how quantum computational devices could be used to tackle problems which are hard to solve by classical means . in this section",

    "the potential profile is reproduced on the vertical axes . in the inset",
    "we reproduce the potential @xmath86 ( dashed line ) and the ground state for the this example ( solid line ) . for the example chosen the probability distribution is more concentrated around a local rather than the global minimum . what matters , however , is that the process jumps between stable configurations , the absolute minimum included.,width=377 ]     + quantum annealing , or _ quantum stochastic optimization _",
    "( qso ) , in the original proposals of refs.@xcite , did not intend to reproduce the dynamics of a quantum mechanical system ( a task computationally untractable @xcite ) , but rather to simulate the ground state process of the hamiltonian @xmath88 as @xmath87 .",
    "the algorithm is completely classical and intends to capture the features of the quantum process which can allow an efficient exploration of the solution space described above .",

    "a direct diagonalization of @xmath78 is impossible , given the dimensionality of the operator which scales exponentially with the dimension of the system .",

    "+ when implemented in a working computer program , the procedure described above requires a variety of approximations .",
    "first of all , equation ( [ eqn : feynmankac ] ) reproduces the ground - state only in the limit @xmath106 , corresponding to sample paths of infinite length .",
    "the expected value of the right hand side of ( [ eqn : feynmankac ] ) , moreover , will be estimated by means of a finite size sample .",
    "finally , the number of neighbours of a configuration may be too large to allow the estimation of @xmath77 on the whole neighbourhood of a given solution .",

    "some `` engineering '' is also in order @xcite ( see the pseudo - code of quantum stochastic optimization reported here ) : for example , we can call a local optimization procedure every @xmath110 quantum transitions .",
    "in addition , if the search looks to be stuck for in a local minimum , we can force a jump to another local minimum . + in fig .",
    "[ fig : qasa ] we show the results produced by qso applied to random instances of the graph partitioning problem : given a graph @xmath111 , where @xmath75 denotes the set of vertices and @xmath112 the set of edges , partition @xmath75 into two subsets such that the subsets have equal size and the number of edges with endpoints in different subsets is minimized .",

    "the ground state @xmath77 is estimated by the same estimation procedure used in qso .",
    "for some optimization problems , such as the graph partitioning described above , itqmc performs better than sa , for others , e.g. 3-sat , it does not .",

    "+ interestingly enough , it has been shown that itqmc performs at least as well as the _ real time _",
    "adiabatic approximation @xcite described in the previous section .",
    "the intuitive reason behind this result has been clearly stated in @xcite : the projection mechanism proper of imaginary time makes the evolution of the initial condition much more stable than the one determined by the schrdinger equation .",
    "the adiabatic theorem , in fact , relates the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state to the annealing time : the smaller the energy gap , the slower must be the change of the hamiltonian @xmath135 in order to avoid landau - zener transitions of the system from the ground to excited states ( which do not correspond to the solution we are looking for ) .",
    "since the projection mechanism suppresses the amplitude associated to excited states by accidental landau - zener transitions , the interpolation between the initial hamiltonian @xmath136 and the target hamiltonian @xmath48 ( the annealing ) can be carried out more rapidly .",
    "it becomes quite natural to ask whether a `` projection '' mechanism similar to the one operated by the unphysical imaginary time evolution is available in some real time quantum dynamics .",
    "if it were possible , we could hope to exploit it to speed up quantum adiabatic computation without worrying too much about landau - zener transitions . _ dissipative quantum annealing _ , a novel model proposed in @xcite , represents one first step in answering this question .",

    "@xcite , modeling the effective interaction of the quantum system with an environment which absorbs energy . in the continuous case",
    "the schrdinger - kostin equation reads : @xmath137 where @xmath78 is the hamiltonian of ( [ eq : schr1 ] ) and @xmath138 by rewriting the state @xmath139 _  la _ de broglie , @xmath140 the nonlinear part @xmath141 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : kostin ] ) assumes the form @xmath142 , whose gradient corresponds to the current velocity @xcite .",
    "this justifies the names _ friction _ for the term @xmath141 and _ friction constant _ for @xmath143 .",
    "+ given a solution @xmath144 of the schrdinger equation @xmath145 the following inequality holds : @xmath146 it means that the energy of the system is a monotone non increasing function of time : the system dissipates energy .",
    "+ in ref.@xcite we showed that friction can play a useful role in suppressing two genuinely quantum effects which can affect the exploration of the solution space : bloch oscillations and anderson localization .",
    "bloch oscillations @xcite are due to the relation @xmath147 between momentum @xmath148 and velocity @xmath149 of a particle moving on a regular lattice : as the momentum of the particle increases monotonically , the velocity can change sing and the particle starts moving backward along the lattice .",
    "+ anderson localization @xcite , instead , appears when the lattice presents irregularities , manifesting themselves as a random potential on the sites of the lattice .",
    "the state of a quantum particle moving in a highly irregular potential landscape is spatially localized and the probability of tunneling through large regions is exponentially suppressed .",
    "+ in @xcite we considered the simple case of a spin chain of finite size @xmath150 governed by an @xmath151 hamiltonian , that is : @xmath152 we took an initial configuration having a single spin up and all the others down .",
    "the spin up plays the role of a _ quantum walker _ and , by a suitable choice of the initial conditions @xcite , it behaves as an excitation moving ballistically along the chain as in figure [ fig : ballistic ] .",
    "the excitation , initially localized at the beginning of the chain , moves ballistically forth and back.,width=207 ]    we introduce a simple potential / cost function @xmath154 .",
    "the motion of the walker is affected as shown in figure [ fig : bloch ] : bloch oscillations appear hindering an exhaustive exploration of the solution space . as figure [ fig : nobloch ] shows , the oscillations can be suppressed by adding the frictional term , in the discretized form : @xmath155 to the system hamiltonian . here",
    "the phase function @xmath156 is defined as in eq.([eq : debroglie ] ) .",
    "+ moreover , the convergence toward the ground state is witnessed by a progressive concentration of the probability mass at the end of the chain were the ground state is localized .",
    "+ potential profiles determined by optimization problems are usually quite irregular .",
    "figures [ fig : anderson ] shows the consequence of the addition of a random potential to the free hamiltonian ( [ eq : freeham ] ) : the probability amplitude remains trapped in the first half of the chain , because of anderson localization .",
    "figure [ fig : noanderson ] shows how dissipation can contrast anderson localization : the probability mass percolates through irregularities and concentrates in the region where we chose to localize the ground state by adding a linear potential @xmath157 as in the previous example .",
    "quantum annealing is an example of cross contamination between two different research areas : computer science and physics .",
    "the `` constructive interference '' goes in two ways : on one side , a genuinely quantum effect , _ tunneling _ , suggested a completely classical approximation algorithm which provides good heuristics to hard combinatorial problems . in this paper we presented in details the earliest version of quantum annealing , quantum stochastic optimization .",
    "+ on the other side , a trick used to estimate the state of minimal energy of a quantum system by classical means , imaginary time evolution ( [ eq : proiezione ] ) , suggested the idea of exploiting dissipation to stabilize the evolution of quantum systems . + a mechanism able to suppress anderson localization would be most welcome in quantum adiabatic computation .",
    "in fact , altshuler _ et al . _ in ref.@xcite advanced the conjecture that _ `` anderson localization casts clouds over adiabatic quantum optimization''_. the preliminary results presented here on the effects kostin friction on simple toy models are promising : anderson localization is suppressed .",
