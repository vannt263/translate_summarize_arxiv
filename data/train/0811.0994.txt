    "ageing is the change of materials properties over time .",
    "ageing phenomena often involve chemical degradation , but there are also many cases of purely physical property changes .",
    "a well - known example is the slight shrinking of plastic rulers over years deriving from an extremely slow density increase with time . understanding physical ageing is obviously important for applications , but physical ageing also presents fundamental scientific challenges and provides valuable insight into materials properties .",
    "this paper shows that utilizing the peltier thermoelectric effect ageing studies may be extended to considerably shorter times than have so far been possible , adding almost two decades to the span of observable ageing times .",
    "a prime example of physical ageing is that of a viscous liquid s properties relaxing close to its glass transition . in equilibrium a liquid s properties",
    "do not change with time , of course .",
    "if temperature is changed , properties gradually adjust themselves to new equilibrium values .",
    "if temperature is lowered , a glass is produced ; recall that by definition a glass is nothing but a highly viscous liquid that has not yet had time to relax fully to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "a glass gradually approaches the equilibrium liquid state .",
    "this state that can only be reached on laboratory time scales , however , if the system is kept just below its glass transition temperature ( `` annealed '' )  contrary to the popular myth windows do not flow observably .",
    "ageing is an intrinsically nonlinear phenomenon .",
    "this is because the ageing rate is structure dependent and itself ages with time @xcite .",
    "therefore ageing studies provide information beyond those obtained by linear - response experiments like dielectric relaxation measurements .",
    "a simple ageing experiment consists of a temperature step , i.e. , a rapid decrease or increase of temperature to a new , constant value .",
    "ideally the new temperature should be well - defined homogeneously throughout the sample and constant in time before any relaxation has taken place .",
    "if that is achieved , it is possible to monitor the complete relaxation to equilibrium of the physical property that is being probed .",
    "what are the requirements for such an ideal ageing experiment ? first , one should obviously have very good temperature control .",
    "secondly , a physical observable is needed that may be monitored fast and accurately and which  preferably  changes significantly for small temperature changes .",
    "third , the set - up should allow for fast temperature changes .",
    "as regards the last point , in current state - of - the - art ageing experiments the characteristic thermal equilibration time @xmath0 is at least 100 s ( @xmath0 is defined by writing the long - time approach to equilibrium @xmath1 ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that heat conduction is a notoriously slow process .",
    "experience shows that in order to monitor a virtually complete ageing curve for a temperature down jump , at least four decades of time must be covered .",
    "thus with present methods , in the best cases one needs of order @xmath2 to perform an ideal temperature down - jump experiment . this is more than a week .",
    "m gap between disks of the dielectric cell .",
    "the peltier element either heats or cools the dielectric cell , depending on the direction of the electrical current powering the element .",
    "the current is controlled by an analog temperature control system that receives temperature feedback information from an ntc thermistor embedded in one disk of the dielectric cell .",
    "a stainless steel electrode pin keeps the cell pressed against the peltier element and provides the electrical connection to one of the disks.,width=453 ]    feynman is famous for his prophesy of the nano - revolution by remarking that there is `` plenty of room at the bottom . '' for ageing experiments",
    "there is also plenty of `` room at the bottom '' , but here at the bottom of the time axis : clearly much is to be gained if it were possible to equilibrate sample temperatures much faster . in order to be able to make faster temperature - jump experiments we have designed a dielectric cell based on a peltier thermoelectric element by means of which heat flow",
    "is controlled via electrical currents ( fig .",
    "the characteristic thermal equilibration time of the new microregulator is two seconds @xcite .",
    "this is 50 times faster than the best conventional equipment .",
    "if required , temperature may be kept constant over weeks , with fluctuations smaller than 100 @xmath3k .",
    "for monitoring ageing , measuring the dielectric loss at some fixed frequency is probably the best choice . with modern equipment",
    "this quantity may be monitored fast and accurately . moreover , for viscous liquids in the right frequency range the dielectric loss changes considerably for small temperature variations .",
    "the use of dielectric relaxation measurements for monitoring ageing was pioneered by leheny _",
    "_ @xcite and by lunkenheimer _",
    "_ @xcite .    using the microregulator we studied ageing of dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) ,",

    "the tn formalism is standard and widely used in industry for predicting ageing effects .",
    "but it is not known whether the material clock has real physical existence or is only a convenient mathematical construct .",
    "this question can not be answered definitively , but the assumption that an inner clock does exist implies a definite prediction . thus if a material time exists controlling all relaxations , the relaxation of the clock rate activation energy must be determined by the same material time that controls the dielectric ageing process . we proceed to formulate a quantitative , model - free test of this .",
    "the dielectric loss of dbp has a high - frequency power - law decay described by @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "we normalize @xmath18 such that it equals the loss peak frequency when the liquid is in equilibrium .",
    "details are given in the supplementary information , but the main idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "2(c ) : even out of equilibrium the dielectric relaxation rate @xmath18 may be determined by measuring the high - frequency loss utilizing    @xmath19    if structural relaxation is also controlled by @xmath18 , this expression allows us to determine the structural relaxation clock rate via    @xmath20    the constant @xmath21 is found by calibrating using equilibrium data from higher temperatures where the loss peak is within the observable frequency range ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) .    the material time @xmath22 is the actual time measured in units of the ( time - dependent ) inverse clock rate @xcite , @xmath23 , i.e.    @xmath24    according to the tn formalism , for all temperature jumps the normalized relaxation function @xmath25 is some function of the material time that has passed since the jump , a function that is independent of the sign and size of the temperature jump : @xmath26 .",
    "generally the function @xmath27 depends on the quantity that is monitored .    the existence of an inner clock , i.e.",
    ", the assumption that the dielectric clock rate equals the structural relaxation clock rate , can be checked without evaluating @xmath22 explicitly or fitting data with analytical functions .",
    "this is done by proceeding as follows .",
    "first , define the dimensionless km relaxation rate by    @xmath28    this quantity is given directly by experiment since both @xmath29 and @xmath18 are determined from @xmath30 .",
    "next , we note that @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath27 is a unique function of @xmath22 , i.e. , independent of sign and size of the temperature jump , then @xmath32 is also unique . in turn",
    "this implies that @xmath11 is a unique function of @xmath33 :    @xmath34    figure 2(d ) shows that this prediction is fulfilled within the experimental uncertainty : the upper part of that figure plots the km relaxation rates @xmath9 as functions of @xmath33 for the four temperature jump experiments of fig .",
    "2(a ) , the lower part plots @xmath11 as functions of @xmath33 .",
    "the long time limit corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "the fact there is data collapse confirms the existence of a material time that controls both dielectric ageing and the ageing of the relaxation rate itself ( the supplementary information provides mathematical details ) .",
    "hz.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]   hz.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    we repeated the experiment for four other liquids , diethyl phthalate , 5 poly - phenyl ether , 2,3 epoxy phenyl propylether and triphenyl phosphite .",
    "these liquids all have high - frequency dielectric losses proportional to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the results for the km rates @xmath36 are plotted in fig .",
    "3(a ) and the corresponding dimensionless km rates in fig .",
    "the spread in km rates at @xmath37 reflects the already mentioned fact that relaxation rates are almost impossible to determine accurately at long times where the noise is of the same magnitude as the distance to equilibrium . in all cases we find good data collapse , confirming the existence of a material time for these liquids .",
    "we here detail the assumptions that must be made in order to arrive at the proposed model - free test of the material clock hypothesis . we first define a generally time - dependent dielectric relaxation rate @xmath38 by generalizing time - temperature superposition , then define the structural relaxation rate @xmath39 , and finally arrive at the test .",
    "the simple power - law high - frequency dielectric loss of dbp and the other liquids studied here , @xmath17 @xcite , is utilized to monitor the dielectric relaxation rate @xmath38 as the structure ages following a temperature change by proceeding as follows . by definition @xmath40 in the equilibrium liquid phase where @xmath41 is the dielectric loss - peak frequency .",
    "if temperature is lowered in a step experiment , the dielectric loss curve continuously moves to lower frequencies as the system relaxes to equilibrium .",
    "the idea is now ( compare fig .",
    "2(c ) ) that how much the dielectric relaxation rate @xmath42 has changed , i.e. , how much the loss peak is displaced , may be determined from how much the loss at some fixed frequency in the high - frequency power - law region changes .",
    "thus if the loss is continuously probed at a fixed frequency , the dielectric relaxation rate is determined from    @xmath43    although this idea seems fairly straightforward , the concept of a dielectric relaxation rate has no obvious definition in a non - stationary situation as that of a relaxing structure . in order to specify the precise assumption needed to define @xmath38 and justify eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , we reason as follows : according to standard linear - response theory , for a system in thermal equilibrium the measured output is calculated from a convolution integral involving the history of the input previous to the measuring time . a convenient way to summarize time - temperature superposition for the equilibrium liquid is to formulate the convolution integral in terms of a dielectric `` material '' time @xmath22 : if @xmath42 is the equilibrium liquid s dielectric relaxation rate ( @xmath40 ) , the dielectric material time is defined from the actual time @xmath44 by @xmath45 . in terms of @xmath22 , if the input variable is the electric field @xmath46 and the output is the displacement vector @xmath47 , the convolution integral is of the form    @xmath48    equation ( [ 2 ] ) describes time - temperature superposition because it implies that , except for an overall time / frequency scaling , the same frequency - dependent dielectric constant is observed at different temperatures ( we ignore the temperature dependence of the overall loss , an approximation which introduces an error of just 1% over the range of temperatures studied ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) the dielectric material time is defined from the actual time by scaling with @xmath42 , a quantity that is of course strongly temperature dependent . in the out - of - equilibrium situations following a temperature jump",
    ", the simplest assumption is that eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) also applies during the ageing process , but with the dielectric material time generalized by now assuming a time - dependent dielectric relaxation clock rate @xmath38 :    @xmath49    as @xmath15 @xmath38 approaches the equilibrium liquid s loss peak frequency @xmath41 at the new temperature , of course .",
    "the equilibrium liquid s power - law dielectric loss @xmath50 applies whenever @xmath51 .",
    "equation ( [ 2 ] ) thus implies that @xmath52 whenever @xmath53 .",
    "it now follows that the proposed generalization of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) now implies that the dielectric relaxation rate @xmath38 may be determined from of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we define the dielectric relaxation rate activation ( free ) energy @xmath54 , which generally depends on time , by writing ( where @xmath55 and the prefactor @xmath56 is taken to be @xmath57 s )    @xmath58    the activation energy depends on structure and it relaxes during strucural relaxation . from the tool - narayanaswami formalism one",
    "expects that after temperature changes the activation energy relaxes following a convolution integral over the temperature history , with a properly defined material time . for convenience",
    "we include the inverse temperature in the defining equation by writing for small temperature variations @xmath59    @xmath60    here the structural relaxation material time is defined by    @xmath61    where @xmath39 is the rate of structural relaxation ( one may have different structural relaxation rates and thus different material times for differing physical quantities relaxing ( volume , enthalpy , ... ) ) .      the assumption that the material clock has real physical existence implies that the dielectric relaxation rate is identical to the structural relaxation rate :    @xmath62    this is not a trivial assumption",
    ". thus eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) may both well apply , but with different definitions of the reduced time .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) is obeyed , however , eq . ( [ 1 ] ) implies that after a temperature jump the logarithm of the measured loss ,    @xmath63    relaxes with the rate that is determined from itself via eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it is this prediction that is tested in the main paper s eq .",
    "( [ prediction ] ) : the dimensionless km relaxation rate @xmath11 of eq .",
    "( [ gammadim_def ] ) is defined by dividing the km relaxation rate @xmath9 by the structural relaxation rate @xmath64 ; this quantity however is determined by means of eq .",
    "( [ clockrate ] ) that actually gives the dielectric relaxation rate @xmath42 .",
    "by measuring several relaxing quantities the existence of a material clock can easily be checked by simply investigating whether or not the quantities relax following the same function of time for various temperature jumps .",
    "this is a direct , model - free test , i.e. , one that neither involves free parameters nor the fitting of data to some mathematical expression . for measurements of just one relaxing quantity as in this paper",
    "we believe that the above is the first model - free demonstration of the existence of an inner clock .    by modern micro engineering it should be possible to extend ageing experiment to even shorter times , thus making it realistic to perform a series of ideal temperature - jump experiments over just hours .",
    "thus it is not unlikely that  eventually  ageing studies could become routine on par with , e.g. , present - day dielectric measurements .",
