    "the photons that penzias & wilson ( 1965 ) detected coming from all directions with a temperature of about @xmath4k have traveled freely since their last thomson scattering , when the universe became cool enough for the ions and electrons to form neutral atoms . during this recombination epoch ,",
    "the opacity dropped precipitously , matter and radiation were decoupled , and the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) were essentially frozen in .",
    "these anisotropies of the cmb have now been detected on a range of scales ( e.g.  white , scott , & silk 1994 ; smoot & scott 1998 ) and developments in the field have been very rapid .",
    "recently , two post-_cobe _  missions , the microwave anisotropy probe ( _ map _ ) and the _ planck _  satellite , were approved with the major science goal of determining the shape of the power spectrum of anisotropies with experimental precision at a level similar to current theoretical predictions .",
    "detailed understanding of the recombination process is crucial for modeling the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies . since the seminal work of the late 1960s ( peebles 1968 ; zeldovich et al .  1968 ) , several refinements have been introduced by , for example , matsuda , sato , & takeda ( 1971 ) , zabotin & naselskii ( 1982 ) , lyubarsky & sunyaev ( 1983 ) , jones & wyse ( 1985 ) , krolik ( 1990 ) , and others , but in fact little has changed ( a fairly comprehensive overview of earlier work on recombination is to be found in section  iiic of hu et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter hssw ) .",
    "more recently , refinements have been made independently in the radiative transfer to calculate secondary spectral distortions ( dellantonio & rybicki 1993 ; rybicki & dellantonio 1994 ) , and in the chemistry ( stancil , lepp , & dalgarno 1996b ) .",
    "these improvements may have noticeable effects ( at the 1% level ) on the calculated shapes of the power spectrum of anisotropies .",

    "our view is that this is in principle such a simple process that it should be so well understood that it could never affect the parameter estimation endeavor .",
    "our motivation is to carry out a ` modern ' calculation of the cosmic recombination process .",

    "s computing power , there is no need to make the sweeping approximations that were implemented 30 years ago .",
    "we therefore attempt to calculate to as great an extent as possible the _ full _ recombination problem .",
    "the other difference compared with three decades ago is that we are now concerned with high precision calculations , because of the imminent prospect of high fidelity data .",
    "it is our intention to present here a coupled treatment of the non - equilibrium radiative transfer and the detailed chemistry .",
    "the present investigation was motivated by indications ( hssw ) that multi - level non - equilibrium effects in h and he , as well as in some molecular species , may have measurable effects on the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies by affecting the low-@xmath3 and high-@xmath3 tails of the visibility function @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the optical depth ) .    to that effect this paper presents a study of the recombination era by evolving neutral and ionized species of h and he , and molecular species of h simultaneously with the matter temperature .",
    "we believe our work represents the most accurate picture to date of how exactly the universe as a whole became neutral .",
    "we will assume that we live in a homogeneous , expanding universe within the context of the canonical hot big bang paradigm .",
    "the general picture is that at some sufficiently early time the universe can be regarded as an expanding plasma of hydrogen plus some helium , with around @xmath7 photons per baryon and perhaps some non - baryonic matter . as it expanded and cooled there",
    "came a time when the protons were able to keep hold of the electrons and the universe became neutral .",
    "this is the period of cosmic recombination .",
    "in cosmology it is standard to use redshift @xmath3 as a time coordinate , so that high redshift represents earlier times .",
    "explicitly , @xmath8 is the scale factor of the universe , normalized to be unity today , and with the relationship between scale factor and time depending on the particular cosmological model .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only hydrogen and helium recombination , since the other elements exist in minute amounts .",
    "the relevant range of redshift is then @xmath9 , during which the densities are typical of those astrophysicists deal with every day , and the temperatures are low enough that there are no relativistic effects .      in describing the radiation field and its interaction with matter",
    ", we must use a specific form of the radiative transfer equation .",
    "it should describe how radiation is absorbed , emitted and scattered as it passes through matter in a medium which is homogeneous , isotropic , infinite , and expanding .",
    "the basic time - dependent form of the equation of transfer is @xmath10 here the symbols are : @xmath11 is the specific intensity of radiation at position @xmath12 , traveling in direction @xmath13 ( the unit direction vector ) , with frequency @xmath14 at a time @xmath15 ( in units of ergs s@xmath16@xmath17hz@xmath16sr@xmath16 ) ; @xmath18 is the path length along the ray ( and is a coordinate - independent path length ) ; @xmath19 is the emissivity , which is calculated by summing products of upper excitation state populations and transition probabilities over all relevant processes that can release a photon at frequency @xmath14 , including electron scattering ; and @xmath20 is the absorption coefficient , which is the product of an atomic absorption cross section and the number density of absorbers summed over all states that can interact with photons of frequency @xmath14 .    in the homogeneous and isotropic medium of the early universe",
    ", we can integrate equation  ( [ eq : radtrans ] ) over all solid angles @xmath21 ( i.e.  integrating over the unit direction vector @xmath13 ) : @xmath22\\ , d\\omega . \\label{eq : angleav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the mean intensity , the zeroth order moment of the specific intensity over all angles ( in units of ergs @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is the flux of radiation , which is the net rate of radiant energy flow across an arbitrarily oriented surface per unit time and frequency interval , and @xmath26 is the speed of light . if the radiation field is isotropic there is a ray - by - ray cancellation in the net energy transport across a surface and the net flux is zero .",
    "also , because of the isotropy of the radiation field and the medium being static , we can drop the dependence upon angle of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in equation  ( [ eq : angleav ] ) . with the definition of @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath28 , this simplifies equation  ( [ eq : angleav ] ) to : @xmath29    the above equation is for a static medium .",

    "the density change will be simply a @xmath30 factor , while the redshifting term will involve the frequency derivative of @xmath23 and hence a @xmath31 factor .",
    "then the equation for the evolution of the radiation field as affected by the expansion and the sources and sinks of radiation becomes @xmath32 , \\label{eq : radfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "this equation is in its most general form and difficult to solve ; fortunately we can make two significant simplifications , because the primary spectral distortions are of negligible intensity ( dellantonio & rybicki 1993 ) and the quasi - static solution for spectral line profiles is valid ( rybicki & dellantonio 1994 ) .",
    "the first simplification is that for the purposes of this paper ( in which we do not study secondary spectral distortions ) , we set @xmath34 , the planck function , which is observed to approximate @xmath35 to at least 1 part in 10@xmath36 ( fixsen et al .",
    "thus we eliminate explicit frequency integration from the simultaneous integration of all equations (  2.6 ) .",
    "the validity of this assumption is shown in  [ sec - distortions ] where we follow the dominant secondary distortions of h ly@xmath37 and h 2-photon by including their feedback on the recombination process , and find that the secondary spectral distortions from the other lyman lines and he are not strong enough to feed back on the recombination process .",
    "the second simplification is in the treatment of the evolution of the resonance lines ( ly@xmath37 , etc . ) which must still be treated explicitly  because of cosmological redshifting they cause @xmath38 in the lines .",
    "these we call the primary distortions .",
    "we use escape probability methods for moving ( expanding ) media (  [ sec - sobolev ] and [ sec-3level ] ) .",
    "this simplification is not an approximation , but is an exact treatment  a simple solution to the multi - level radiative transfer problem afforded by the physics of the expanding early universe .",
    "not only does using @xmath39 with the escape probability method instead of @xmath23 simplify the calculation and reduce computing time enormously , but the effects from following the actual radiation field will be small compared to the main improvements of our recombination calculation which are the level - by - level treatment of h , and , calculating recombination directly , and the correct treatment of triplet and singlet states .",

    "equilibrium among the excited states n  @xmath280 is assumed , meaning that the net bound - bound rates are zero .",
    "4 shows that the net bound - bound rates are actually different from zero at @xmath281 .",
    "the reason for this is that at low temperatures , the strong but cool radiation field means that high energy transitions are rare due to few high energy photons .",
    "more specifically , photoexcitation and stimulated photodeexcitation for high energy transitions become rare ( e.g.  7010 , 504 etc . ) . in this case",
    "spontaneous deexcitation dominates , causing a faster downward cascade to the n=2 state .",
    "in addition , the faster downward cascade rate is faster than the photoionization rate from the upper state , and one might view this as radiative decay stealing some of the depopulation ` flux ' from photoionization . both the faster downward cascade and the lower photoionization rate contribute to the faster net recombination rate .",
    "the cool radiation field is strong , so photoexcitations and photodeexcitations are rapid among nearby energy levels ( e.g.  7065 , etc .",
    "; see fig .",
    "4 ) . what we see in fig .",
    "4 is that with time , after @xmath281 , the n=70 energy level becomes progressively decoupled from the distant lower energy levels ( n=2,3, ... 20 , ... ) , but remains tightly coupled to its nearby ` neighbors ' ( n=60,65 , etc . )",
    "this explains the departures from an equilibrium boltzmann distribution ( in the excited states ) as seen in the shape of the curves in fig .",
    "5 illustrates the non - equilibrium of the excited states by showing the ratio of populations of the excited states compared to a boltzmann equilibrium distribution with respect to n=2 .",
    "we find that the upper levels of the hydrogen atom are not in thermal equilibrium with the radiation , i.e.  the excited levels are not populated according to a boltzmann distribution .",
    "the excited states are in fact overpopulated relative to a boltzmann distribution .",
    "this is not a surprise for the population of the n=2 state , which is strongly overpopulated compared to the n=1 ground state , and so should be all n  @xmath280 states because all lyman lines remain optically thick during recombination .",
    "what _ is _ surprising is that all excited states develop a further overpopulation _ with respect to _ n=2 and each other .",
    "note that this is not a population inversion",
    ". the recombination rate to a given high level is faster than the downward cascade rate , and this causes a ` bottleneck ' creating the overpopulation .",
    "5 shows that all states are in equilibrium at high redshifts , with the highest states going out of equilibrium first , followed by lower and lower states as the redshift decreases .",
    "the factor by which the excited states are over - populated approaches a constant at high n for a given redshift , with this factor increasing as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "the ratio is constant because the high energy level rydberg states have very similar energy levels to each other , with a relatively large energy separation from the n=2 state ( i.e.  the exponential term in equation  ( [ eq : boltz ] ) dominates over the @xmath282 ratios , and the exponential term is similar for all of the rydberg states . )",
    "5 also shows an enormous ratio at low redshift ( @xmath283 ) for number densities of the actual excited states to the number densities of a boltzmann distribution of excited states , on the order of @xmath284 . at such a low redshift , there are almost no electrons in the excited states ( @xmath285 @xmath286 ) , and so unlike at higher redshifts , the ratio is only an illustration of the strong departure from an equilibrium distribution ; the actual populations are very low in any case .    in comparison with the standard equilibrium capture - cascade calculation for @xmath95 ,",
    "the unusual situation described above ( caused by the strong but cool radiation field ) leads to higher effective recombination rates for the majority of excited states without increasing photoionization proportionally .",
    "this results in a higher net rate of production of neutral hydrogen atoms , i.e.  a lower @xmath2 .      to demonstrate why the non - equilibrium in the excited states of h affects the recombination rate",

    "an important new benefit of our level - by - level calculation lies in replacing the recombination coefficient with a direct calculation of recombination to and photoionization from each level at each redshift step . in other words",

    "the important point here is that our method allows redistribution of the h level populations over all 300 levels at each redshift step , which feeds back on the recombination process via equation  ( [ eq : feedback ] ) , and leads to the lower @xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "this redistribution of the level populations is not possible in the standard calculation s equation  ( [ eq : nofeedback ] ) which only considers the populations @xmath55 , @xmath291 , and @xmath104 , and considers the excited level populations @xmath292 to be proportional to @xmath104 in an equilibrium distribution .",
    "a small improvement in our new recombination treatment over the standard treatment is in our distinguishing the various temperature dependencies of recombination .",

    "collisional ionization and collisional recombination rates for the highest energy levels are of the same order of magnitude as the photoionization and recombination rates , though not greater than them ( see fig .  6 )",
    "case b recombination excludes recombination to the ground state and considers the lyman lines to be optically thick ( i.e.  photons associated with all permitted radiative transitions to n=1 are assumed to be instantly reabsorbed ) .",
    "an implied assumption necessary to compute the photoionization rate is that the excited states ( n  @xmath90 ) are in equilibrium with the radiation .",
    "unlike the standard recombination calculation , our method allows departures from case b because the lyman lines are treated by the sobolev escape probability method which is valid for any optical thickness , and our method allows departures from equilibrium of the excited states (  [ sec - resultsmulti ] ) .",
    "we find that the excited states depart from equilibrium at redshifts @xmath1 , so case b does not hold then .",

    "the previous study that was closest in approach to our own was that of dellantonio & rybicki ( 1993 ) , who calculated recombination for a ten - level hydrogen atom in order to estimate the spectral distortions to the cmb blackbody radiation spectrum .",
    "ten levels are insufficient to calculate recombination accurately , because the higher energy levels of the atom are completely ignored ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "however the accuracy of the ionization fraction ( @xmath2 ) was sufficient to determine the magnitude of the spectral distortions .",
    "their recombination model treated individual levels , but used a recombination coefficient to each level of the form @xmath296 . because the form of the recombination coefficient dominates the h recombination process , our models are not equivalent , and",
    "so there is little use in comparing the results .",
    "more recently , boschan & biltzinger ( 1998 ) derived a new parameterized recombination coefficient to solve the recombination equation of the standard calculation , and to generate spectral distortions in the cmb .",
    "their calculation differs from ours in that their recombination coefficient is pre - calculated .",
    "hence it is not an interactive part of the calculation , and does not allow the advantages that our calculation does , mainly the feedback of the non - equilibrium in the excited states on the net recombination rate . while they include pressure broadening for a cutoff in the partition function , they neglect thermal broadening .",
    "a more serious problem is their method of inclusion of stimulated recombination , as originally suggested by sasaki & takahara ( 1993 ) , who included stimulated recombination as positive recombination instead of negative ionization .",
    "the physics ( as described in  [ sec - recomb ] ) and our computational results are the same regardless of whether stimulated recombination is treated as positive recombination or negative ionization",

    "the main improvement in our calculation over previous treatments of helium is that we use a multi - level atom , a multi - level atom with triplets and singlets treated correctly , and evolve the population of each energy level with redshift by including all bound - bound and bound - free transitions .",

    "we give the helium saha equations here : + for @xmath301 @xmath302 and for @xmath301 @xmath303 here the @xmath304s are ionization potentials , @xmath252 is the total number density of hydrogen , @xmath305 is the total number fraction of helium to hydrogen @xmath306 , and our definition of @xmath307 results in the complicated - looking left hand sides .",
    "the extra factor of 4 on the right hand side for @xmath301 arises from the statistical weights factor .",
    "while our improved @xmath2 agrees fairly closely with saha recombination for ( see   [ sec - heii ] ) , the difference in @xmath2 from saha recombination during recombination is dramatic . our new detailed treatment of shows recombination finishing just after the start of h recombination ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , i.e.  significantly delayed compared with the saha equilibrium case .",
    "this is different from the earlier calculations ( e.g.  mst ) , in which recombination is finished well before h recombination begins . in this previous case",
    ", recombination still affected the cmb anisotropy power spectrum on small angular scales because the diffusion damping length grows continuously and is sensitive to the full thermal history ( hssw ) . in our new case , particularly for our low @xmath294 models recombination is still finishing at the very beginning of h recombination , which further affects the power spectrum at large angular scales ( see   [ sec - powerspectrum ] ) .",
    "we show a ` blow - up ' of the two helium recombination epochs in fig .  10 .      the physics of recombination can be summarized as follows .",
    "there are three major aspects to it : ( 1 ) the has excited states which are able to retain charge ; but ( 2 ) being very close to the continuum , the highly excited states are easily photoionized by the radiation field at @xmath308 ; then ( 3 ) we have a standard hydrogenic - like case b recombination , which is unaffected by neutral h removing @xmath309@xmath298 ( resonance line ) photons .",
    "the atom has a metastable , i.e.  very slow , set of states  the triplets ( e.g.  n@xmath310n@xmath311 ) .",
    "therefore , overall the excited states of can naturally retain more charge than a simple hydrogenic system under boltzmann equilibrium .",
    "the situation would resemble what we found for h recombination with the enhanced populations of the higher states , and would lead to faster reduction of @xmath2 .",
    "however , the high excited states of are much more strongly ` packed ' towards the continuum compared to those of h ; the energy difference between the @xmath312 levels and the continuum is @xmath313ev for versus @xmath314ev for h , compared to @xmath315ev versus @xmath316ev for the ground state ",
    "continuum energy difference .",
    "this is enough to depopulate the triplets ( whose ` ground state ' is n=@xmath317 ) , given the much higher radiation temperature during recombination .",
    "left on its own under these circumstances , would recombine much like the standard case  b effective 3-level h atom , i.e.  slower than saha recombination .",
    "there is one possible obstacle ",
    "it is the existence of some neutral h , which could ` steal ' resonance line photons , invalidate the effective case  b and make it a saha recombination instead .",
    "however , our detailed calculation shows that neutral h during recombination is not able to accomplish that , and the process is _ not _ described by saha equilibrium .",
    "11 shows that saha equilibrium recombination is invalid for , by comparing the three possible destruction processes of the @xmath309@xmath298 ( in h this is ly@xmath37 ) photons : ( 1 ) cosmological redshift ; ( 2 ) the @xmath299@xmath298 two - photon rate ; and ( 3 ) the photoionization rate of the ground state of h by the same @xmath309@xmath298 photons . fig .",
    "11 clearly shows that process ( 3 ) is negligible ( in contradiction to the discussion in hssw ) . to be doubly sure that absorption of these photons by hydrogen is negligible we explicitly included the relevant rate in our models and found no discernible effects . in order for recombination to be approximated by saha equilibrium , one of the 3 processes described above would have to be faster than or equal to the saha equilibrium rate , which we do not find to be the case .",
    "the recombination of is slow for the same reasons that h recombination is , namely because of the optically thick n@xmath297@xmath298 transitions which slow cascades to the ground state , and the exclusion of recombinations to the ground state . in other words",
    "follows a case b recombination . because the ` bottleneck ' at n=2 controls recombination , it is not surprising that and h recombination occur at a similar redshift ; the ionization energy of n=2 is similar in both .",
    "recombination is slower than h recombination because of its different atomic structure .",
    "the excited states of are more tightly packed , and the @xmath309@xmath298 energy difference greater than that of h. the strong radiation field keeps the ratio of photoionization rate / downward cascade rate higher than in the h case , resulting in a slower recombination .",
    "we find the strong radiation field also causes the triplet states to be virtually unpopulated .",
    "the lack of electrons in triplet states is easily understood by considering the blackbody radiation spectrum . at recombination ( z @xmath318 3000 ) , the blackbody radiation peak is around @xmath319ev , so there are around 11 orders of magnitude more photons that can ionize the lowest triplet state 2@xmath320s ( @xmath321ev ) , than the singlet ground state ( @xmath315ev ) , since both are on the steeply decreasing wien tail .",
    "it is interesting to note that in planetary nebulae where the young , hot ionizing star produces most of its energy in the uv , the opposite occurs : the atoms have few electrons in the singlet states ; instead most of them are in the triplet states .",
    "there is one more possible method to speed up recombination , and that is collisional rates between the triplets and singlet states .",
    "if fast enough , the collisional rates would provide another channel to keep hold of captured electrons  by pumping them into the triplet states faster than they can be reionized .",
    "the triplets are 3 times as populated as the singlets due to the statistical weight factors . by forcing the collisional rates to be greater than the recombination rates and the bound - bound radiative rates",
    ", we find an extremely fast he i recombination  approximated by the saha equilibrium .",
    "essentially we force electrons from the singlets into the triplets faster than they can cascade downwards , and faster than they can be photoionized out of the triplets . in reality , the collisions are negligible , a few orders of magnitude less than the radiative rates .",
    "it is important to note that apart from collisions , the singlet and triplet states are _ only _ connected via the n@xmath310n@xmath311 transitions , which are orders of magnitude slower than the @xmath317@xmath298 rate .",
    "we note here that mst stated that the collisional rates were high enough to cause equilibrium between the triplet and singlet states .",
    "one must be careful to compare all relevant rates , and we keep all of them in our code .",
    "we find the allowed radiative rates ( e.g.  photoexcitation and photodeexcitation ) are greater than the collisional rates . therefore the allowed",
    "radiative rates control the excited states population distribution , _ not _ the collisional rates .",
    "in other words , electrons in the singlet states are jumping between bound singlet states faster than the collisional rates can send them into the triplet states .",
    "we note here that mst used an effective 3-level singlet atom and calculated recombination in the same way as the standard h calculation ( equation  ( [ eq : standard_xe ] ) ) with the appropriate parameters .",
    "when we follow their treatment , we get essentially the same result as our multi - level calculation .",
    "we are not sure why mst obtained such a fast recombination .    as with hydrogen",
    ", we have also investigated what is required to achieve an accurate solution for helium , without modeling the full suite of atomic processes .",
    "we have found that the use of the ` effective 3-level ' equations for helium ( as described in mst ) , together with an appropriate recombination coefficient for singlets only ( equation  ( [ eq : hecoefficient ] ) ) , results in a very accurate treatment of @xmath259 during the time of helium recombination . in detail",
    "it is necessary to follow hydrogen and helium recombination simultaneously , increasing the number of differential equations to solve .",
    "however , little accuracy is in fact lost by treating them independently  since recombination is governed by dramatic changes in time scales through boltzmann factors and the like , and is affected little by small changes in the number of free electrons at a given time .",
    "further details are discussed in seager , sasselov , & scott ( 1999 ) .",
    "although our model does not explicitly use a recombination coefficient , it does allow us to calculate one easily .",
    "to aid other researchers it is worth presenting a fit for the singlet - only case  b recombination coefficient for ( including recombinations to all states except the ground state ) from the data in hummer & storey ( 1998 ) .",
    "hummer & storey ( 1998 ) compute photoionization cross sections that are more accurate than the ones we use ( hofsaess 1979 ) , but are not publicly available . following the functional forms used in the fits of verner & ferland ( 1996 ) we find @xmath322^{-1}\\!\\!\\ ! m^3 s^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath323m@xmath320s@xmath16 , @xmath324 , @xmath325k , and @xmath326 fixed arbitrarily at @xmath4k .",
    "this fit is good to @xmath327 over the relevant temperature range ( 4,00010,000k ) , and still fairly accurate over a much wider range of temperatures .",
    "recombination occurs too early to affect the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies . for completeness , we mention it briefly here .",
    "recombination is fast because of the very fast two photon rate .",
    "14 shows that for most cosmologies the two - photon rate is faster than the net recombination rate , meaning that as fast as electrons are captured from the continuum they can cascade down to the ground state . because of this , there is essentially no ` bottleneck ' at the n=2 level . in high baryon models",
    ", recombination can be approximated using the saha recombination .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "9 , recombination is slightly slower than the saha recombination for low baryon models .",

    "13 and  14 show the same rate comparison for and .",
    "the three figures all have the same scale on the @xmath146 and @xmath329 axes , for easy comparison .",
    "recombination is controlled by the @xmath309@xmath298 rate rather than the @xmath299@xmath298 rate as previously stated ( e.g.  mst ) .",
    "13 ( for ) also illustrates the slow net recombination rate , which is the primary factor in the slow case b recombination .",
    "14 also illustrates that in the high @xmath294 and @xmath330 models has a @xmath243@xmath328 rate faster than the net recombination rate , meaning that there is no slowdown of recombination due to n@xmath331 , and the saha equilibrium approximation is valid .",
    "the rates change with cosmological model .",
    "physically this is because all of the rates are very sensitive to the baryon density .",
    "the @xmath309@xmath298 rates are further affected by the hubble factor because the sobolev approximation ( equations  ( [ eq : indofphi ] ) and  ( [ eq : sobtau ] ) ) , depends on the velocity gradient . whether most of the atoms in the universe recombined via a @xmath277@xmath328 or",
    "a @xmath243@xmath328 two - photon transition depends on the precise values of the cosmological parameters . a confident answer to that question",
    "is still not known , given today s parameter uncertainties .",
    "our approach in this work has been to include all relevant degrees of freedom of the recombining matter in a consistent and coupled manner .",
    "this requires special attention to the quality of the atomic data used .",
    "the challenge lies in building a consistent model for @xmath332 energy levels and transitions , not just for the low - lying ones , which are often better known experimentally and theoretically .",
    "hydrogen ( and the hydrogenic ion of helium ) have exactly known rate coefficients for radiative processes from precise quantum - mechanical calculations ( uncertainties below 1% ) .",
    "we use exact values for the bound - bound radiative transitions and for radiative recombination , as in e.g.  hummer ( 1994 ) . for more details",
    "see hummer & storey ( 1987 ) , but also brocklehurst ( 1970 ) and johnson ( 1972 ) .",
    "in particular , the rate of radiative recombination to level n of a hydrogenic ion can be evaluated from the photoionization ( bound - free ) cross section for level n , @xmath333 , with the standard assumption of detailed balance ( see   [ sec - recomb ] ) .",
    "for hydrogenic bound - free cross sections , we follow in essence seaton s work ( seaton 1959 ) with its asymptotic expansion for the gaunt factor ( see brocklehurst 1970 ) .",
    "note that the weak dependence of the gaunt factor on wavelength has a noticeable effect in our final recombination rate calculation .",
    "given our application , we do not require the resolution of resonances , as achieved for a few transitions by the opacity project ( topbase , canto et al .",

    "certainly do not exceed the 1% level .",
    "collisional rate coefficients can not be calculated exactly .",

    "we basically followed hummer & storey ( 1987 ) and hummer ( 1994 ) in building the model atom . for our application ,",
    "collisional processes are negligible , so that the large uncertainties that still persist for the collisional rates have no impact on our results .",

    "no exact solutions to the schrdinger equation are available for helium . however",
    ", very high precision approximations are now available ( drake 1992 , 1994 ) which we have used .",
    "these approximations are essentially exact for all practical purposes .",
    "the largest relativistic correction comes from singlet - triplet mixing between states with the same n , @xmath131 , and @xmath27 , but is still small .",
    "transition rates were calculated following the recent comprehensive model built by smits ( 1996 ) and some values in theodosiou ( 1987 ) .",
    "the source of our photoionization cross sections was topbase ( cunto et al .",
    "1993 ) and hofsaess ( 1979 ) for small n ; above n=10 we used scaled hydrogenic values .",
    "new detailed calculations ( hummer & storey 1998 ) show that the photoionization cross sections become strictly hydrogenic at about n  @xmath336 .",
    "the uncertainties in the radiative rates are at the 5% level and below .",
    "the situation with the collisional rates for is predictably much worse than for radiative rates , with good r - matrix calculations existing only for n  @xmath337 ( sawey & berrington 1993 ) .",
    "the collisional rates at large n are a crucial ingredient in determining the amount of singlet - triplet mixing , but fortunately collisions are not very important for the low density conditions in the early universe , so the large uncertainty in these rates does not effect our calculation .",
    "the born approximation , which assumes proportionality to the radiative transition rates , is used ( see smits 1996 ) to calculate the collisional cross sections for large n.    for the @xmath299@xmath298 two - photon rate for we used the value @xmath338 ( drake et al . 1969 ) which differs from a previously used value ( dalgarno  1966 ) by @xmath339 .",
    "an uncertainty even of this magnitude would still make little difference in the final results .",

    "dielectronic recombination for is not at all important during recombination .",
    "while dielectronic recombination dominates at temperatures above @xmath342k , for the range of temperatures relevant here it is at least 10 orders of magnitude below the radiative recombination rate ( using the fit referred to in abel et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we have gathered together the uncertainties in the atomic data in order to estimate the resulting uncertainty in our derivation of @xmath2 .",
    "the atomic data with the dominant effect on our calculation are the set of bound - free cross sections for all h and levels  not so much any individual values , but the overall consistency of the sets ( which are taken from different sources ) .",
    "the differences between our model atom and hummer s ( 1994 ) reflect the uncertainty in the atomic data . to test the effect on our hydrogenic results , we compared the @xmath2 results of an effective 3-level atom using hummer s ( 1994 ) recombination coefficient with the results using a recombination coefficient calculated with our own model h atom .",
    "we find maximum differences of 1% at @xmath343 , which corresponds to measurable effects on cmb anisotropies of much less than 1% .",
    "the error in @xmath2 arising from is more difficult to calculate .",
    "we estimate it to be considerably less than 1% , because the low level ( n  @xmath344  4 ) bound - bound and bound - free radiative rates dominate recombination , and as described above , those data are accurate .      in our recombination calculation",
    "we follow ` secondary ' distortions in the radiation field that could affect the recombination process at a later time .",
    "the secondary distortions are caused by the primary distortions that are frozen into the radiation field . at a later time",
    "they are redshifted into interaction frequency with other atomic transitions .",
    "explicitly , we follow : ( 1 ) h ly@xmath37 photons ; ( 2 ) h @xmath243@xmath328 photons . by the time of h recombination these photons have been redshifted into an energy range where they could photoionize h(n=2 ) .",
    "in addition we follow : ( 3 ) @xmath309@xmath298 ; ( 4 ) @xmath299@xmath298 . by the time of h recombination",
    "these photons have been redshifted into an energy range which could photoionize h(n=1 ) . and",
    "finally we also follow : ( 5 ) ly@xmath37 photons ; ( 6 ) @xmath243@xmath328 photons . by the time of h recombination these photons have been redshifted into an energy range which could photoionize h(n=1 ) . these photons bypass because the photons have not been redshifted into a suitable energy range for interaction .    here",
    "we only attempt to investigate the maximum effects of secondary spectral distortions . to that end",
    "we do not include additional distortions which are smaller .",
    "for example , lyman lines other than ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 5 ) , whose distortions are smaller than ly@xmath37 , will produce a comparably smaller feedback on photoionization .",
    "the singlet recombination photons could theoretically photoionize triplet states , but as previously discussed there are virtually no electrons in the triplet states , so this process is also negligible .",
    "another possible effect is due to the similar energy levels of h and : @xmath345 .",
    "for example , the transition from ( n=4 ) to ( n=2 ) produces the same frequency photons as the transition from h  ( n=2 ) to ( n=1 ) .",
    "these transitions are theoretically competing for photons , and this effect can be important for other astrophysical situations ( e.g.  planetary nebulae ) where h and simultaneously exist .",
    "however , any such effect is negligible for primeval recombination because during recombination the amount of neutral h is very small ( [ h/ ] @xmath346 ) , and during h recombination , there is almost no ( [ /h]@xmath347 ) .    because we are only investigating maximum effects we assume the photons were emitted at line center and are redshifted undisturbed until their interaction with h(n=1 ) or h(n=2 ) as described above .",
    "we also assume two photons at half the energy for the @xmath243@xmath328 transitions , compared to the @xmath277@xmath328 transitions .",
    "the distorting photons emitted at a time @xmath348 are absorbed at a later time @xmath3 , where @xmath349 here @xmath350 is the photoionization edge frequency where the photons are being absorbed , and @xmath351 is the photon s frequency at emission .",
    "the distortions are calculated as @xmath352\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\mbox{}- n_i(z_{\\rm em})b_{ij }   b\\big(\\nu_{\\rm em},t_{\\rm r}(z_{\\rm em})\\big)\\bigg\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath353 is the planck function at the time of emission ; @xmath354 and @xmath355 are the einstein coefficients ; @xmath117 is the sobolev escape probability for the line ; and the other variables are as described previously .",
    "the distortions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were previously discussed by rybicki & dellantonio ( 1992 ) .",
    "they pointed out that the effect from ( 1 ) should be small , because the ly@xmath37 distortion must be redshifted by at least a factor of 3 to have any effect .",
    "this means that the ly@xmath37 photons produced at @xmath356 will only affect the balmer continuum at @xmath112 when the recombination process ( and any possibility of photoionization ) is almost entirely over .",
    "we find that including the distortions ( 1 ) through ( 6 ) improves @xmath2 during h recombination at less than the @xmath357 level .",
    "this difference is far too small to make a significant change in the power spectrum , and it is negligible compared to the major improvements in this paper , which are the level - by - level treatment of h , , and , allowing departures of the excited state populations from an equilibrium distribution , calculating recombination directly to each excited state , and the correct treatment of triplet and singlet states .",
    "however , the removal of these distorting photons by photoionization must be taken into account when calculating spectral distortions to the cmb blackbody , which we plan to study in a later paper .      including the detailed hydrogen chemistry ( see   [ sec - chem ] )",
    "marginally affects the fractional abundances of protons and electrons at low @xmath3 .",
    "however , the correction is of the order @xmath358 at @xmath359 .",
    "this change in the electron density would change the thomson scattering optical depth by @xmath360 , too little to make a difference in the cmb power spectrum .    on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "15 , the different @xmath259 that we find will lead to fractional changes of similar size in molecular abundances at low @xmath3 , since h@xmath164 for example is formed via h@xmath361 which is affected by the residual free electron density .",
    "the delay in recombination compared to previous studies causes a similar delay in formation of he molecules ( p.  stancil , private communication ) . however , with the exception of he@xmath362 , no changes are greater than those caused by the residual free electron density at freeze - out . since molecules can be important for the cooling of primordial gas clouds and the formation of the first objects in the universe , the precise determination of molecular abundances is an important issue ( e.g.  lepp & shull 1984 , tegmark et al .",
    "1997 , abel et al .",
    "1997 , galli & palla  1998 ) .",
    "however , the roughly 10 - 20% change in the abundance of some chemical species is probably less than other uncertainties in the reaction rates ( a.  dalgarno , private communication ) . with this in mind",
    ", we suspect no drastic implications for theories of structure formation .",
    "even relatively small differences in the recombination history of the universe can have potentially measurable effects on the cmb anisotropies .",
    "and so we might expect our two main changes ( one in h and one in he ) to be noticeable in the power spectrum . as a first example fig .",
    "16 compares the difference in the anisotropy power spectrum derived from our new @xmath259 to that derived from the standard recombination @xmath2 ( essentially identical to that described in hssw ) , for hydrogen recombination only . here",
    "the @xmath363s are squares of the amplitudes in a spherical harmonic decomposition of anisotropies on the sky ( the azimuthal index @xmath364 depends on the choice of axis , and so is irrelevant for an isotropic universe ) .",
    "they represent the power and angular scale of the cmb anisotropies by describing the rms temperatures at fixed angular separations averaged over the whole sky ( see e.g.  white , scott , & silk  1994 ) .",
    "these @xmath363s depend on the ionization fraction @xmath2 through the precise shape of the thickness of the photon last scattering surface ( i.e.  the visibility function ) .",
    "since the detailed shape of the power spectrum may allow determination of fundamental cosmological parameters , the significance of the change in @xmath2 is evident . to determine the effect of the change in @xmath2 we have used the code cmbfast written and made available by seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) , with a slight modification to allow for the input of an arbitrary recombination history .",
    "the dominant physical affect arising from the new h calculation comes from the change in @xmath2 at low @xmath3 .",
    "a process seldom mentioned in discussions of cmb anisotropy physics ( which are otherwise quite comprehensive , e.g.  hu , silk , & sugiyama  1997 ) is that the low-@xmath3 tail of the visibility function results in _ partial erasure _ of the anisotropies produced at @xmath365 .",
    "the optical depth in thomson scattering back to , for example , @xmath366 ( @xmath367 ) can be several percent .",
    "this partial rescattering of the photons leads to partial erasure of the @xmath368s by an amount @xmath369 .",
    "let us look at the standard cdm calculation first ( fig .",
    "our change in the optical depth back to @xmath370 ( see fig .  2 ) is around 1% less than that obtained using the standard calculation , and so we find that the anisotropies suffer less partial erasure by about 2% .",
    "there is no effect on angular scales larger than the horizon at the scattering epoch ( here redshifts of several hundred ) , so that all multipoles are effected except for the lowest hundred or so @xmath237s .",
    "hence this effect is largely a change in the overall normalization of the power spectrum , with some additional differences at low @xmath237 which will be masked by the ` cosmic variance ' .",
    "in addition there are smaller effects due to changes in the _ generation _ of anisotropies in the low-@xmath3 tail , giving small changes in the acoustic peaks , which can be seen as wiggles in the figure .",
    "since the partial erasing effect is essentially unchanged in the case of the @xmath371 model , these otherwise sub - dominant effects are more obvious in fig .",
    "16(b ) .",
    "differences in the power spectra are rather small in absolute terms , so fig .",
    "16 plots the relative difference .",
    "we have shown this for our two chosen models , one being standard cold dark matter ( a ) , which we will refer to as scdm , and the other being an extreme baryon - only model ( b ) .",
    "these models are meant to be representative only , and changes in cosmological parameters will result in curves which differ in detail .",
    "we describe how to calculate an approximately correct recombination history for arbitrary models in a separate paper ( seager , sasselov , & scott  1999 ) .",
    "since the main effect is similar to an overall amplitude change , we normalized our cmb power spectra to have the same large - scale matter power spectrum , which is equivalent to normalizing to the same amplitude for the initial conditions .",
    "the amplitude of the effect of our new h calculation clearly depends on the cosmology . for the high @xmath294 and @xmath330 case ,",
    "the freeze - out value of @xmath2 is much smaller ( around @xmath372 ) , and since the fractional change in @xmath2 is similarly @xmath373% , the absolute change in ionization fraction is much lower than for the scdm model .",
    "the integrated optical depth is directly proportional to @xmath374 , which is small , despite the increase in @xmath294 and @xmath330 .",
    "hence we see a much smaller increase from our hydrogen improvement in fig .",
    "the normalization change is rather difficult to see , since it is masked by relatively small changes around the power spectrum peaks , giving wiggles in the difference spectrum .    the dashed lines in fig .",
    "16 show the effect on the power spectrum for cmb polarization . in standard models polarization",
    "is typically at the level of a few percent of the anisotropy signal , and so will be difficult to measure in detail ( see hu & white  1997b for a discussion of cmb polarization ) .",
    "we show the results here to indicate that there are further observational consequences of our improved recombination calculation ( explicitly we have plotted the ` e ' mode of polarization , see e.g.  seljak 1997 ) . the effect of our improvements on the polarization can be understood similarly through the visibility function . since the polarization power spectrum tends to have sharper acoustic peaks , the wiggles in the difference spectrum are more pronounced than for the temperature anisotropies .",
    "note that the large relative differences at low @xmath237 are actually very small in absolute terms , since the polarization signal is so small there .",
    "the polarization - temperature correlation power spectrum and the ` b ' mode of polarization ( for models with gravity waves ) could also be plotted , but little extra insight is gained , and so we avoid this for the sake of clarity .",
    "the other major difference we find compared with previous treatments is in the delayed recombination of . in fig .",
    "17 we show the effect of our new calculation , again as a fractional change in the cmb anisotropy power spectrum versus multipole @xmath237 .",
    "the change in the recombination of affects the density of free electrons just before hydrogen recombination , which in turn affects the diffusion of the photons and baryons , and hence the damping scale for the acoustic oscillations which give rise to the peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "the phases of the acoustic oscillations will also be affected somewhat , which shows up in the wiggles in the difference spectrum . for cdm - like models",
    "the main effect is the change in the damping scale , since we now think there are more free electrons at @xmath3752000 .",
    "the resulting change in the @xmath368s is essentially the same as assuming the wrong angular scale for the damping of the anisotropies ( see hu & white  1997a ) , which is the same physical effect that hssw found in arguing for the need to include recombination _",
    "at all _ for obtaining percent accuracy in the @xmath368s .",
    "the effect of this improved on the power spectrum will depend on the background cosmology through the baryon density ( @xmath376 ) and the horizon size at last scattering through @xmath377  hence there is no simple fitting formula , and it is necessary to calculate the effect on the anisotropy damping tail for each cosmological model considered .",
    "there are really two parts to the effect .",
    "firstly the extra @xmath2 makes the tight coupling regime tighter , so that the photon mean free path is shorter , and the length scale for diffusion is smaller .",
    "secondly , the effective damping scale comes from an average over the visibility function , so an increase in the high-@xmath3 tail also leads to a smaller damping scale .",
    "the cmb anisotropies can be thought of as a series of acoustic peaks multiplied by a roughly exponential damping envelope , with the characteristic multipole of the cut - off being determined by the damping length scale . as a result of this smaller damping scale ,",
    "the high @xmath237 part of the power spectrum is _ less _ suppressed , and so we see an increase in fig .",
    "17(a ) towards high @xmath237 . for the @xmath378 model ( fig .  17(b ) ) we see only a very small effect at the highest @xmath237s .",
    "this is easily understood by examining fig .",
    "10 , where we see that recombination is pushed back to higher redshifts than for the scdm case , and also that h recombination happens earlier , which , together with the higher @xmath294 and @xmath330 , shifts the peak of the visibility function to lower redshifts relative to the recombination curve .",
    "hence the the high-@xmath3 tail of the visibility function is much less affected in this case , and our improved calculation has essentially negligible effect .",
    "however , for less extreme models we find that the effect is always at least marginally significant .",
    "taking the two main effects together , for the scdm model , we find that they have essentially the same sign , so that the total effect of our new calculation is more dramatic ( see fig .",
    "both effects lead to a slight increase in the anisotropies , particularly at small angular scales ( high @xmath237 ) .",
    "although the exact details will depend on the underlying cosmological model , we see the same general trend for most parameters we have looked at",
    ". the change can be higher than 5% for the smallest scales , although it should be remembered that the absolute amplitude of the anisotropies at such scales is actually quite low .",
    "nevertheless , changes of this size are well above the level which is relevant for future determinations of the power spectrum . as a rough measure",
    ", the cosmic variance at @xmath379 is about 3% .",
    "hence a 1% change over a range of say 1000 multipoles is something like a @xmath380 effect for a cosmic variance limited experiment .",
    "what we can see is that although the effects are far from astonishing , they are at a level which is potentially measurable . hence our improvements are significant in terms of using future cmb data - sets to infer the values of cosmological parameters ; if not properly taken into account these subtle effects in the atomic physics of hydrogen and helium might introduce biases in the determination of fundamental parameters .      with the model described in this paper we plan to calculate spectral distortions to the blackbody radiation of the cmb today ( see also dubrovich  1975 ; lyubarsky & sunyaev 1983 ; fahr & loch 1991 ; dellantonio & rybicki  1993 ; burdyuzha & chekmezov 1994 ; dubrovich & stolyarov 1995 , 1997 ; boschan & biltzinger  1998 ) . the main emission from ly@xmath37 and the two - photon process will be in the far - infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "transitions among the very high energy levels , which have very small energy separations , may produce spectral distortions in the radio .",
    "although far weaker than distortions by the lower lyman lines , they will be in a spectral region less contaminated by background sources .",
    "detecting such distortions will not be easy , since they are generally swamped by galactic infra - red or radio emission and other foregrounds .",
    "our new calculation does not yield any vast improvement in the prospects for detection .",
    "however , confirmation of the presence of these recombination lines would be a definitive piece of supporting evidence for the whole big bang paradigm . moreover , detailed measurement of the lines , if ever possible to carry out , would be a direct diagnostic of the recombination process . for these reasons we will present spectral results elsewhere .",
    "one point we would like to stress is that our detailed calculation agrees very well with the results of the effective 3-level atom .",
    "this underscores the tremendous achievement of peebles , zeldovich and colleagues in so fully understanding cosmic recombination 30 years ago .",
    "however , the great goal of modern cosmology is to determine the cosmological parameters to an unprecedented level of precision , and in order to do so it is now necessary to understand very basic things , like recombination , much more accurately .",
    "we have shown that improvements upon previous recombination calculations result in a roughly 10% change in @xmath2 at low redshift for most cosmological models , plus a substantial delay in recombination , resulting in a few percent change in the cmb power spectrum at small angular scales . specifically , the low redshift difference in @xmath2 is due to the h excited states departure from an equilibrium distribution .",
    "this in turn comes from the level - by - level treatment of a 300-level h atom , which includes all bound - bound radiative rates , and which allows feedback of the disequilibrium of the excited states on the recombination process .",
    "the large improvement in @xmath2 during recombination comes from the correct treatment of the atomic levels , including triplet and singlet states . while it was already understood that recombination would affect the power spectrum at high multipoles ( hssw ) , our improved recombination affects even the start of h recombination for traditional low @xmath294 models .",
    "there is thus a substantially bigger change in the @xmath368s , reaching to larger angular scales .",
    "careful use of @xmath67 rather than @xmath66 can also have noticeable consequences , as to a lesser extent can the treatment of ly@xmath37 redshifting using the sobolev escape probability .",
    "our other new contributions to the recombination calculation produce negligible differences in @xmath2 .",
    "collisional excitation and ionization for h , and for are of little importance .",
    "inclusion of additional cooling and heating terms in the evolution of @xmath67 also produce little change in @xmath2 .",
    "the largest spectral distortions do not feed back on the recombination process to a level greater than @xmath357 in @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the h chemistry occurs too low in redshift to make any noticeable difference in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "although we have tried to be careful to consider every process we can think of , it is certainly possible that other subtle effects remain to be uncovered .",
    "we hope that we do not have to wait another 30 years for the next piece of substantial progress in understanding how the universe became neutral .",
    "the program recfast , which performs approximate calculations of the recombination history is available at http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/recfast.html ( fortran version ) and at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/ @xmath381sasselov / rec/ ( c version ) .",

    "<S> in addition we find that recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations , and occurs only just before h recombination . </S>",
    "<S> these changes in turn can affect the predicted power spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few percent level .    </S>",
    "<S> other improvements such as including molecular and ionic species of h , including complete heating and cooling terms for the evolution of the matter temperature , including collisional rates , and including feedback of the secondary spectral distortions on the radiation field , produce negligible change to @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . the lower @xmath2 at low @xmath3 found in this work affects the abundances of h molecular and ionic species by 1025% . </S>",
    "<S> however this difference is probably not larger than other uncertainties in the reaction rates . </S>"
