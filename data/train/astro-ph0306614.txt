    "proving the existence of black holes remains a key goal of observational high energy astrophysics .",
    "while dynamical evidence ( e.g. charles 1998 ) convincingly demonstrates the existence of compact accreting objects in binary systems which have masses in excess of the highest theoretical limit for a neutron star ( @xmath0 ) , and are therefore strong black hole candidates ( bhcs ) , we can not rule out the possibility that some as - yet - unconsidered state of matter may provide an alternative explanation .    as an alternative approach , in recent years",
    "much attention has been focussed on finding evidence for black hole event horizons .",
    "one promising and actively pursued route has been a comparison of the x - ray luminosities of bhc and neutron star ( ns ) x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) in ` quiescence ' . in such states ,",
    "black hole accretion could be advection dominated and considerably fainter than neutron stars .",
    "this is indeed what has been found observationally , with ` quiescent ' bhcs being typically two to three orders of magnitude ( in eddington units ) less luminous than their ns xrb equivalents .",
    "this has been claimed to represent some of the strongest evidence to date for the existence of black hole event horizons ( narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997 ; menou et al .",
    "1999 ; garcia et al .",
    "however , alternatives to this interpretation have also been discussed ( campana & stella 2000 ; bildsten & rutledge 2000 ; abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ) .",
    "abramowicz et al . ( 2002 ) , in particular , stress that ` absence of evidence is not evidence of absence ' , and draw attention to alternatives to black holes .",
    "even if bhcs _ do _ contain black hole with event horizons , it is important to establish how much , if any , of the potential accretion energy may be being advected across their horizons .    in a series of important and related observations , in recent years it has been established that jets are an integral and relatively ubiquitous component of the process of accretion in both black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries ( e.g. mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ; fender 2002 ) .",
    "we are now beginning to understand just how powerful these jets may be .",
    "corbel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discovered that , over four orders of magnitude in x - ray luminosity , the relation between radio and x - ray luminosity for the bhc x - ray binary gx 339 - 4 has the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 for @xmath3 in the 39 kev range ( @xmath4 increases slightly with the increasing energy of the x - ray band used for comparison ) .",
    "gallo , fender & pooley ( 2003 ) demonstrated that the same relation holds over a comparable range in x - ray luminosity for the transient v404 cyg ( gs 2023 + 338 ) , and furthermore that the data for all measured low / hard state sources is consistent with a such a universal relation holding for all of them .",
    "this power law relation between radio and x - ray luminosity is a key observational discovery providing clues to the underlying physics of the disc  jet coupling .",
    "are there differences in jet power between the bhcs and ns xrbs ?",
    "fender & kuulkers ( 2001 ) found that bhc xrbs were , in general between 10100 times more ` radio loud ' ( in the sense of the radio to soft x - ray ratio ) than neutron star binaries .",
    "migliari et al .",
    "( 2003 ) compared the radio strength of the atoll - type neutron star binary 4u 1728 - 34 with the comparable state and x - ray luminosity of bhcs , and found a ratio of radio loudness @xmath5 .",
    "the origin of this difference in radio loudness is not clear ( see fender & kuulkers 2001 for a discussion ) .",
    "in the following all luminosities and accretion rates are in eddington units , where the eddington luminosity is @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass of the accreting compact star .",
    "the eddington accretion rate , defined as that accretion rate at which the eddington luminosity is achieved , is , for an accretion efficiency of @xmath9% ( ie .",
    "@xmath10 is liberated during the accretion process ) approximately @xmath11 g s@xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the total power output @xmath12 from an x - ray binary in a ` low / hard ' or analogous state is a combination of the radiative luminosity of the flow ( @xmath3 , directly observed as x - rays ) and jet power ( @xmath13 indirectly traced by e.g. radio flux density ) :    @xmath14    now we already know ( corbel et al . 2002 ; gallo et al . 2003 ) the relation between radio ( @xmath15 ) and x - ray luminosity :    @xmath16    how does observed radio flux relate to jet power ; i.e. what is the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath13 ? in models of optically thick jets ( e.g. blandford & knigl 1979 ; falcke & biermann 1996 ; markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ; heinz & sunyaev 2003 ) , the following scaling applies :    @xmath17    combining equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) :    @xmath18    therefore    @xmath19    which provides the relation between total power and x - ray luminosity .",
    "the normalisation @xmath20 between can be estimated .",
    "fender ( 2001 ) and corbel & fender ( 2002 ) conservatively estimate @xmath21 for cyg x-1 and gx 339 - 4 at an accretion luminosity of @xmath22 .",
    "fender et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimated that , at an accretion luminosity of @xmath23 , the black hole transient xte j1118 + 480 had @xmath24 ( see also corbel & fender 2002 for an estimate for gx 339 - 4 ) . conservatively adopting the equality for xte j1118 + 480 corresponds to @xmath25 in eddington units . equivalently the relation between total power and jet power is given by :    @xmath26    in the following we shall assume that @xmath12 is proportional to the mass accretion rate @xmath27 ( i.e. all the available accretion power goes either into the x - rays or the jet ) . in eddington units",
    "this corresponds to    @xmath28    which is the condition of no advection of accretion energy across the event horizon",
    ".    we can then plot the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath13 as a function of mass accretion rate .",
    "these are plotted for black holes in the top panel of fig 1 .",
    "we note that there are two regimes , ` x - ray dominated ' at higher mass accretion rates , and ` jet dominated ' at lower accretion rates . in the x - ray",
    "dominated regime , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "however in the jet dominated regime @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the transition between the two regimes occurs at @xmath33 or , equivalently , @xmath34 .",
    "the shaded region in the top panel of fig 1 indicates the observed range of x - ray luminosities of black hole x - ray binaries in ` quiescence '  if our model is correct then _ all _ of these systems are in the jet - dominated regime , with accretion rates @xmath35 , and with jet powers one to two orders of magnitude greater than the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "a major uncertainty in knowing if the arguments outlined above apply to neutron stars is that the relation @xmath36 has not yet been measured .",
    "migliari et al . (",
    "2003 ) note that the relation seems steeper ( @xmath37 ) for the atoll - type x - ray binary 4u 1728 - 34 , but this is over a small range in x - ray flux compared to that measured for black holes . at present",
    "we must consider that this relation remains unmeasured , due primarily to the relative faintness of atoll - type sources in the radio band compared to black holes ( fender & hendry 2000 ) , which results from the greater ` radio loudness ' of black holes ( fender & kuulkers 2001 ; migliari et al .",
    "however , we will make the assumption in what follows that the same relation does indeed apply for atoll - type ns xrbs .",
    "as already noted , the ratio of ` radio loudness ' between bhc and ns xrbs is @xmath38 . using equation ( [ jetradio ] )",
    ", this translates into a difference in jet power of a factor 10 , i.e. @xmath39 . the x - ray luminosity below which neutron star systems would be jet - dominated is therefore @xmath40 .",
    "this is comparable to the lowest x - ray luminosity measured from a neutron star in quiescence ( garcia et al .",
    "2001 ) implying that , quite unlike black holes , we may have never observed a neutron star in a jet - dominated state . in the lower panel of fig 1",
    "we plot the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath13 as a function of mass accretion rate for neutron star binaries . as for the bhcs",
    ", the shaded region indicates the observed range of ` quiescent ' x - ray luminosities .    in the absence of core / crustal emission ( see below ) which is decoupled from the accretion flow on all but the longest timescales , the observed x - ray luminosities of ` quiescent ' ns xrbs correspond to a range in accretion rate of @xmath41 , overlapping with the range in @xmath27 for ` quiescent ' black holes .",
    "therefore , in at least this respect , in the model presented here the data are consistent with both ns and bhc xrbs in ` quiescence ' accreting at the same rate .",
    "brown , bildsten & rutledge ( 1998 ) have argued that , once accretion has halted , neutron stars will have a luminosity in the range @xmath42  @xmath43 erg s@xmath7 from crustal emission .",
    "this model seems to be supported by observations of transient neutron star binaries in quiescence ( e.g. rutledge et al .",
    "2001a ; rutledge et al .",
    "2001b ; rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ; see also wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ) , although garcia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that even at ` quiescent ' levels the x - ray luminosity is dominated by accretion . indeed , the quiescent emission of sax j1808.43658 is uncomfortably low ( 5@xmath44 ) and hard ( power law index 1.5 with a blackbody contribution of less than 10 per cent ) for the neutron star crustal emission model unless the neutron star is more massive than 1.7 m@xmath45 ( campana et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "if this crustal emission does exist then it adds a new term to the total observed x - ray emission :    @xmath46    in fig 1 ( lower panel ) we also indicate the solutions with the addition of persistent ` crustal ' emission to the observed x - ray flux from a neutron star , at a level of @xmath47 erg s@xmath7 , approximately the lowest luminosity observed from a quiescent neutron star .",
    "this has a significant effect , since this crustal luminosity , at @xmath48 is above that at which neutron stars would enter the jet - dominated regime .",
    "whereas in the case of accretion - only luminosity , while we had not observed neutron stars in jet - dominated regimes they were still possible , if such crustal luminosities are ubiquitous then neutron stars will not enter the jet - dominated regime , unless their time - averaged mass accretion rates are very low ( @xmath49 @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , note that at the lowest accretion rates neutron stars will make just as powerful jets as bhcs ( see next section ) .",
    "this work leads naturally to some interesting consequences if correct .",
    "we outline these below .",
    "we have seen in the above that below a certain mass accretion rate bhc x - ray binaries probably enter a jet - dominated state . because of their higher ` radio loudness ' ,",
    "black holes make the transition to this jet - dominated state at a higher mass accretion rate than neutron stars ( by a factor @xmath51 ) .",
    "consequently , if there are no other effects , once both ns and bh are in the jet - dominated regime , the ns systems will be a factor @xmath51 brighter in x - rays than the bh systems .",
    "since @xmath52 then we expect a ratio of @xmath53 between quiescent x - ray luminosities at the same accretion rate .",
    "in fact , while the expressions and plots given so far are specifically for the condition in equation ( 3 ) and the estimated values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , there is a more general expression for the ratio of x - ray luminosities when both classes of object are in the jet - dominated regime :    @xmath56    since @xmath38 and @xmath57 , we expect a ratio of x - ray luminosities in quiescence of @xmath58 , when both bhcs and ns xrbs are in the jet - dominated regime , and at the same mass accretion rate .",
    "this is consistent with what is observed .",
    "the x - ray luminosities as a function of @xmath27 are illustrated in fig 2 ( top panel ) .",
    "as already noted , the quiescent ns xrbs may not be quite in the jet - dominated regime ; however , the bhc xrbs are clearly in this regime , and the difference in x - ray luminosities at the same accretion rate is already one order of magnitude at @xmath59 , increasing to @xmath60 at @xmath61 ( fig 2 , top panel ) .",
    "we therefore find that the observed @xmath62 scaling , combined with the order of magnitude greater radio loudness of bhc xrbs , naturally results in a signficant difference in the quiescent luminosities of ns and bhc xrbs , as observed .",
    "more precisely , we expect there to be three regimes in which the ratio of x - ray luminosities , @xmath63 has different values :    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     where ( a ) corresponds to both classes of objects being ` x - ray dominated ' , ( b ) corresponds to bhcs being jet - dominated and ns not , ( c ) corresponds to both classes being jet - dominated . from this study",
    "it appears that @xmath64 , and that observed ` quiescence ' corresponds to regimes ( a ) or ( b ) , which consistent with the observations without requiring any accretion energy to be advected across an event horizon .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the jet - dominated regime , the scaling of x - ray luminosity with mass accretion rate , @xmath65 is exactly the same as that predicted theoretically by adaf models ( e.g. narayan et al .",
    "1997 ; mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "it would be a mistake to assume that the persistent difference in x - ray luminosity will result in a difference in jet powers between ns and bhc systems at the lowest luminosities .",
    "in fact , below an accretion rate of @xmath66 both ns and bhc systems are putting the same amount of power into the jet ( fig 2 , lower panel ) , which dominates the power output of the system .",
    "the tiny fraction of the total power released as x - rays is insignificant whether its a bhc or a ns xrb one hundred times brighter .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the ratio in radio loudness , @xmath67 is maintained throughout this scenario , but for somewhat different reasons in the two regimes .",
    "when ` x - ray dominated ' , bhcs are more ` radio loud ' because they match the ns xrbs in x - rays but put out more radio power .",
    "however , at the lowest accretion rates the radio power is the same but the x - ray luminosity of the bhcs is lower , maintaining the ratio .      it has been suggested that the hard x - ray spectra observed from low / hard state bhcs may be in some , maybe all , cases optically thin synchrotron emission directly from the jet ( markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ; markoff et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this is at odds with the more standard view of the hard x - ray spectrum as being dominated by thermal comptonisation from electrons with a temperature of @xmath53 kev ( e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; poutanen 1998 , zdziarski et al .",
    "if it is the correct interpretation , how does it affect the analysis performed here ?",
    "since in those models the bhcs are already completely jet dominated at @xmath68 , then @xmath69 ( as @xmath70 [ equation ( 4 ) ] and @xmath32 this is always the case for jet - dominated emission ) .",
    "in fact it can be shown that the same ratio of ` quiescent ' luminosities is achieved as in the previous analysis , as long as the ns xrbs are _ not _ already jet - dominated at @xmath71 ( otherwise @xmath3 in both classes of objects would track each other ) .",
    "however , the transition to the jet - dominated regime would occur at a higher @xmath27 ( by approximately two orders of magnitude ) , meaning the observed ` quiescent ' mass accretion rates would be considerably higher than those indicated in fig 1 .",
    "the results presented in this letter are necessarily a subset of the possible consequences of the empirical relations and model upon which they are based . of the more general results , to be expanded upon in a further work ,",
    "only one is given , namely that once both bhc and ns xrb are in jet dominated states the ratio of x - ray luminosities depends only upon two quantities which have already been measured , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath67 :    @xmath72    we suggest that based upon existing observational data , ` quiescent ' bhcs are in the ` jet - dominated ' regime and that ns xrbs are , if not jet - dominated , close to the transition to this regime .",
    "specifically , if a similar value of @xmath4 holds for ns xrbs as for bhcs ( and this is the key observational uncertainty ) then quiescent ns xrbs are , in the most conservative case , putting @xmath73% of their power into jets .",
    "thus the observed ratio of x - ray luminosities should be close to @xmath60 , consistent with what is observed .",
    "an additional core / crustal contribution to the x - ray emission from ns xrbs will only widen the discrepancy . essentially , we find that the difference in quiescent x - ray luminosities between ns and bhc xrbs can be mostly , if not entirely , explained by a difference in the efficiency of jet production between the two types of sources ( the origin of which remains unclear ) .",
    "therefore we find that the observed difference in quiescent luminosities of neutron star and black hole candidate xrbs _ does not require the presence of black hole event horizons_. this should not be taken as a statement to the effect that we do not believe that black hole candidates contain black holes ( see related discussion in abramowicz et al .",
    "certainly there are differences between the neutron star and black hole candidate xrbs , which may be naturally explained by the fact that black hole candidates do in fact contain black holes . however , since there is no requirement for significant energy to be advected into the black hole in order to explain the ratio of quiescent x - ray luminosities , these luminosities can not in turn be taken as ` proof ' of the existence of event horizons .",
    "furthermore , even if , as seems probable , the bhcs do contain black holes with event horizons , this work shows that there is no requirement for the advection of any significant quantity of accretion energy across the horizon .",
    "rather , the relative radiative inefficiency of bhcs compared to ns xrbs at low @xmath27 is due to the low radiative efficiency of the _ jets _ they are powering , not the accretion flow itself .",
