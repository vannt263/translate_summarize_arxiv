    "glassy systems , like supercooled liquids , polymers , granular material , vortex glasses , ionic conductors , colloids , plastic crystal and spin glasses , can be defined as materials characterized by a slowing down of one or more degrees of freedom which prevents the system to reach the equilibrium as the temperature decreases ( angell 1984 , gtze 1989 , angell 1995 , ediger _",
    ".    in particular , spin glasses ( sg ) are dilute alloys of magnetic atoms in low concentration in a non - magnetic matrix where the relevant degrees of freedom are the impurities spins interacting via random magnetic couplings .",
    "the randomness gives rise to _ frustration _",
    ", i.e. a competition that prevents the systems to minimize the global free energy ( mezard _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) .",
    "one of the characteristic phenomenon of glassy systems is their complex dynamics well above the calorimetric glass transition at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "for example there is a dynamical transition at @xmath5 from high - temperatures exponential to low - temperatures non - exponential correlation functions .",
    "another feature is the crossover at @xmath6 with @xmath7 between a high - temperature power law growth of correlation times to an arrhenius behaviour @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the activation energy .",
    "this phenomenology is well seen in experiments ( angell 1984 , angell 1995 , ediger _",
    "_ 1996 andreozzi _",
    "_ 1998 ) .    here",
    "we show the numerical results on frustrated models with and without disorder , the potts sg ( psg ) and the potts fully frustrated ( pff ) model respectively , where the dynamical anomalies correspond to static transitions , giving some insights on the relation between dynamics and statics in glassy systems and clarifying the role played by frustration and by disorder",
    ". the model could be also useful to understand some recent experimental results on finite - temperature diverging static susceptibility in glassy systems ( see for example dixon _",
    "_ 1990 , menon and nagel 1995 , leheny and nagel 1997 ) .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian @xmath10 \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where to each lattice site is associated an ising spin @xmath11 and a @xmath0-state potts spin @xmath12 .",
    "the sum is extended over all nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites , @xmath13 is the sign of interaction and @xmath14 is the strength of interaction .",
    "when the @xmath15 are quenched random variables we will refer to the model as the psg , while when they are distributed in a deterministic way to frustrate each lattice cell we will refer to it as the pff . for @xmath16 the psg ( pff ) model recovers the ising sg ( ff ) model .",
    "the model can be interpreted as a system with @xmath0-states orientational degrees of freedom frustrated by means of coupled ising spins which take into account for effects due to geometrical hindrance ( e.g. like in plastic crystals , where the centers of mass of the molecules form a regular crystal but the molecules are frustrated respect to the orientational degrees of freedom , or in o - terphenyl or in glycerol ) .",
    "the way in which the frustration is introduced distinguishes this model by other models , e.g. the potts glass ( kirkpatrick and wolynes 1987 , thirumalai and kirkpatrick 1998 ) , used to study structural glasses .",
    "both psg and pff models can be mapped on a fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) percolation model ( fortuin and kasteleyn 1972 , coniglio and klein 1980 ) , defining the fk clusters as maximal sets of spins connected by bonds activated between nn spins with probability @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant ) when both the nn potts and ising spins minimize the coupling energy and using the relation @xmath19 where @xmath20 if the cluster configuration @xmath21 contains any frustrated loop ( defined below ) , otherwise @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of clusters in the configuration @xmath21 , @xmath24 is the number of activated bonds and @xmath25 is total number of interactions .",
    "a frustrated loop is a closed path that has an odd number of antiferromagnetic interactions ( coniglio _ et al .",
    "while the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is defined only for integer @xmath26 , the partition function ( [ partition_function ] ) is meaningful for any values of @xmath0 ( fierro _ et al .",
    "the numerical phase diagrams of psg and pff model are shown in ( franzese and coniglio 1998 , franzese 1999 ) and are qualitatively reproduced in figure [ fig1 ] for the 3d case .",
    "two transition temperatures are seen .",
    "the lower temperature @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) corresponds to a sg ( or ff respectively ) transition in the universality class of @xmath29 ising sg ( or ising ff ) model . the higher @xmath3 corresponds to the percolation transition of fk clusters and for any integer @xmath26 marks a real thermodynamic transition in the universality class of a ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model ( wu 1982 ) . at @xmath3",
    "the susceptibility of potts spins diverges ( franzese and coniglio 1998 , franzese 1999 ) . in the psg model , above @xmath3 , there is the griffiths temperature @xmath1 defined as the critical temperature of a ferromagnetic model with the same number of states of the disordered model ( @xmath30 for the @xmath0-state psg model ) .",
    "this transition is consequence of the presence of ferromagnetic regions , due to disorder , and vanishes for vanishing external field ( griffiths 1969 ) .",
    "from the dynamical point of view we have studied ( franzese and coniglio 1999 , franzese 1999 ) for @xmath31 both for psg and pff the time dependent nonlinear susceptibility @xmath32 ^ 2\\right\\rangle } \\label{chi_sg_t}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath33 is the total number of spins and @xmath34 is the equilibrium time ) that converges asymptotically for @xmath35 to the usual static nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "the normalized correlation function is @xmath36 with @xmath37 . following ( campbell and bernardi 1994 )",
    "the infinite size behavior of @xmath38 has been extrapolated at every @xmath39 plotting the data for finite linear sizes @xmath40 , 25 , 30 , 40 vs @xmath41 .    to test the form of @xmath38 we fitted the data @xmath42 with a simple exponential",

    "the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 used in the fit @xmath43 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 are plotted in figures [ parpsg ] , [ parpff ] for psg and pff respectively . in the same figures",
    "is shown also the integral correlation time defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the generic correlation function .    in figure [ parpsg ] for psg it is possible to distinguish three dynamical regions .",
    "a high temperatures region for @xmath52 where the correlations functions are exponential ( @xmath53 ) ; an intermediate region for @xmath54 where @xmath55 and the correlation time s growth is a power law forecasted by the mode coupling theory ( mct ) ( gtze 1989 ) or mean field ( mf ) theory ( see for example bouchaud _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 and references therein ) ; a lower temperatures region for @xmath56 where activated processes dominate the dynamics ( i.e. the correlation times follow an arrhenius law ) as in the experimental glasses ( angell 1984 , angell 1995 , ediger _",

    ", the intermediate region disappears and both the dynamical transition at @xmath58 and the crossover at @xmath6 occur at a temperature numerically consistent with @xmath3 .    for the pff model we have calculated also the correlation functions for the potts order parameter @xmath59/(s-1)$ ] ( where @xmath60 is the density of potts spins in the @xmath61-th state ) defined as @xmath62 , \\label{corrm}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath63 and @xmath34 is the equilibration time ) . at the potts transition temperature @xmath3 the static susceptibility related to @xmath64 diverges ( franzese 1999 ) and the parameter @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the fit forms @xmath43 and @xmath48 of @xmath65 becomes less than one and diverging respectively , as shown in figure [ pff_m ] .",
    "the divergence of @xmath47 comes out from the observation that @xmath66 grows for increasing @xmath67 at any @xmath68 and there is a cusp at a temperature consistent to @xmath3 within the numerical error .",
    "psg and pff model reproduce the experimental phenomenology of fragile glasses above the glass transition , recovering the dynamical transition between exponential and non - exponential correlation functions and the crossover between the power law growth , predicted by mf theories and mct , and the activated arrhenius regime for the correlation times .",
    "in particular , the disordered psg model shows three different dynamical regimes experimentally seen for spin @xmath69 probes in glass - forming liquids like o - terphenyl ( andreozzi _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "the models show that these dynamical transitions and crossovers can be related to static thermodynamic transitions : in the psg to the griffiths transition and to the potts transition . while in the pff model only to the potts transition .",
    "the mapping of these models on fk percolation model , show that the potts transition coincides with a percolation transition where frustrated loop are excluded , giving a geometrical interpretation of the effects of frustration .",
    "furthermore at the potts transition the susceptibility associated to the potts variables diverges .",
    "this result is reminescent of recent experimental findings ( see for example dixon _",
    "_ 1990 , menon and nagel 1995 , leheny and nagel 1997 ) . in the models presented here",
    "this divergence is explained by the ordering of the orientational degrees of freedom",
    ". if such a divergence is present also in structural glasses like plastic crystals is matter of debate ( schneider _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "moreover the pff model emphasizes that dynamical anomalies are not related to the presence of frustration _ and _ disorder , but also to the sole frustration and in this case @xmath70 , that is the ordering temperature of the orientational degrees of freedom , marks the onset of these anomalies .",
    "this could be relevant in the study of dynamical behavior of experimental ff systems like josephson junction arrays ."
