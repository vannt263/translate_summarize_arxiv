    "type ia supernova ( sn ia ) is thought to originate from an accreting carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system @xcite .",
    "however , it is uncertain what is the companion star supplying its mass .",
    "there are two scenarios to explain sne ia .",
    "one is the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario , in which the companion star is a main sequence or a red giant star @xcite .",
    "the envelope of the companion star overflows the roche lobe , and transfers to the surface of the wd .",
    "the other is the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario , in which two wds merge and end up with explosion @xcite . to distinguish the two scenarios , we need to find observable differences between them .    in the sd scenario , sn ejecta collide with its companion .",
    "@xcite simulated this collision and found that high energy photons are emitted from the shock - heated region into a certain limited solid angle and that the emission becomes prominent before the peak of the light curve due to @xmath1 decay .",
    "this emission is strong especially in a wd + red giant system .",
    "@xcite investigated early phases of observed light curves gathered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to see whether they have this prompt emission . by comparing its early light curve with the observations",
    ", they found that there is no obvious emission feature in the light curves , which constrained the event rate of each model . as a result , a progenitor system with a main sequence companion more massive than @xmath2 or a red giant is ruled out as the primary source of sne ia .",
    "@xcite assumed the lte condition and further that whole matter is composed of radiation dominated gases with @xmath3 . we suspect that they overestimated the radiation temperature of the emission regions .",
    "in fact , based on their detailed calculations of spectra from the same hydrodynamical models presented here , @xcite argued that hydrogen rich matter filling in the hole excavated by the companion star prevents the photosphere from quickly receding to the ni - rich region and makes the sn redder than expected by the previous study @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite focused only on the impacts on light curves .",
    "we investigate also the influence on spectra .",
    "if the material stripped from the companion does not spread in a wide solid angle , hydrogen lines from the companion might appear in the spectrum , depending on the line of sight .",
    "@xcite investigated nebula spectra of some sne ia and found the upper limit of @xmath4 for solar abundance material .",
    "several authors @xcite calculated the mass of the material stripped from the companion star by the collision",
    ". @xcite performed hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the stripped mass . according to their results , the stripped masses are @xmath5 for the @xmath6 main sequence companion , @xmath7 for the @xmath6 red giant companion . on the other hand , there is no spectral feature of the stripped material in observed spectra .",
    "recently , @xcite adopted a more realistic profile for a main sequence companion from a binary evolution theory and found that the stripped mass decreases to @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite investigated signatures of hydrogen lines in the phase later than the maximum light when the shock heating due to the collision has been already consumed by adiabatic expansion .    in this study",
    ", we relax the assumption of the instantaneous coupling between gas and radiation to examine whether or not the decoupling of gas and radiation changes the influence on light curves found by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we investigate whether hydrogen in the stripped material leaves its trace in spectra especially before maximum light . in later phases",
    ", @xcite already studied spectra for the same model presented here . at first",
    ", we simulated the collision of a sn ia with its companion with a radiation hydrodynamical code .",
    "secondly , we calculated spectra by ray - tracing snapshots of the distributions of density , temperatures , and velocity obtained from the simulation .",
    "section 2 describes our models .",
    "section 3 and 4 present the numerical methods for the simulation and ray - tracing . in section 5",
    ", we describe our results .",
    "section 6 concludes this study .",
    "as progenitor systems , we consider three models named ms , rga , and rgb ( table.[model.tbl ] ) .",
    "model ms is a close binary system with a main sequence companion .",
    "we use a polytropic star with the index @xmath9 to model the structure of the companion star .",
    "we assume the companion star composed of a solar abundance material .",
    "its mass @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "the binary separation @xmath12 is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "this model is the same as the @xmath11 main sequence model in @xcite .",
    "model rga is a close binary system with a red giant companion . in this model ,",
    "the companion star consists of the helium core and the hydrogen - rich envelope with the solar abundance .",
    "its core mass and total mass @xmath10 are equal to @xmath14 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the binary separation @xmath12 is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "we assume a fully convective envelope with @xmath16 . in the hydrodynamical simulation ,",
    "the core is treated as a point source of gravity .",
    "this model is the same as the @xmath11 red giant model in @xcite .",
    "model rgb is the same as model rga but with a longer separation , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "the radii @xmath18 of the companion stars in the above models are obtained by an empirical law for close binary systems assuming that the companion stars fill the roche lobe .",
    "@xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the mass of the progenitor wd , which is equal to @xmath21 .",
    "thus @xmath22 .",
    ".models in our calculation . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when neutral hydrogen is located outside the photosphere where the temperature is lower than the photospheric temperature , h@xmath0 line might appear as absorption in the spectrum .",
    "results from the simulation and ray - tracing explained in the previous sections are presented in the following subsections .      from the above simulation",
    ", we obtain spatial structures of the ejecta and the stripped material .",
    "the stripped mass from the companion star is calculated by adding up the mass of hydrogen rich gas with the fluid velocity exceeding the escape velocity .",
    "the masses are @xmath23 in model ms , @xmath24 in model rga , and @xmath25 in model rgb . in model",
    "ms , the amount is overestimated , compared to the previous studies ( about @xmath8 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is because we do not have enough resolution in the low velocity region around the companion star due to the remapping process .",
    "on the other hand , in models rga and rgb , the amount is slightly smaller than the previous studies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the trend that the entire envelope is stripped by the impact is consistent with these studies .",
    "figures  [ pict2d-ms.eps]-[pict2d-rgb.eps ] show distributions of density @xmath26 and total number abundance @xmath27 at days 1 and 20 after the explosion in each model .",
    "as shown in the figures , the hydrogen - rich material is stripped along the line @xmath28 . at day 20",
    ", the ejecta and the stripped material are already expanding homologously .",
    "a cavity is created around the axis @xmath28 with the spread angle of @xmath29 .",
    "if we view this sn with a viewing angle in this range , the stripped hydrogen is not hidden by the surrounding ejecta .",
    "figure  [ pict1d.eps ] shows one - dimensional structures of the density @xmath26 , the gas temperature @xmath30 , and the radiation temperature @xmath31 along the line @xmath28 at day 1 .",
    "we calculate the position of the photosphere where thermalization length is equal to unity , which is indicated by the dotted vertical line .",
    "the photospheric temperature is equal to @xmath32 for model ms , @xmath33 for model rga , and @xmath34 for model rgb .",
    "@xcite analytically estimated the effective temperature of the prompt emission as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the electron scattering opacity , and @xmath38 is the time in days . at @xmath39 , @xmath40 is estimated as @xmath41 for model ms , @xmath42 for model rga , and @xmath43 for model rgb , in comparison , the temperatures become lower in our simulation .",
    "this is because the collision heats the gas first in our simulations , which separately treat the temporal evolutions of the radiation and gas energy densities .",
    "the subsequent emission from the gas is not enough to raise the photospheric temperature as high as this formula due to the low densities .",
    "bolometric light curves with viewing angles @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are shown in figure  [ lcurve.eps ] .",
    "the collision radiates prompt emission especially in the range of @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite analytically estimated bolometric luminosities due to the collision at day 1 to be @xmath50 for the @xmath6 main sequence model , @xmath51 for the @xmath2 main sequence model , and @xmath52 for the @xmath6 red giant model . in comparison with our results , the luminosity is equal to @xmath53 for model ms , @xmath54 for model rga , and @xmath55 for model rgb .",
    "the luminosities in models ms , rga are dimmer than the previous study .",
    "this is because the temperature of emission region becomes lower than their results . in the analysis of @xcite , the luminosity in the @xmath2 main sequence model",
    "is the threshold above which a progenitor system is ruled out from the primary source of sne ia .",
    "the luminosity in model rga is on this threshold .",
    "a model with a slightly longer separation as model rgb is to be ruled out because the emission can yet be detected . here",
    "one should note that our models may underestimate the strength of the coupling between the gas and radiation because the free - free emission and the energy exchange by compton scattering , which our models do not include , accelerate the equilibration as pointed out by @xcite . as a result",
    ", we may significantly underestimate the luminosity due to the shock heating .",
    "more elaborate numerical studies including the comptonization are needed to assess this effect . in figure",
    "[ rvcurve.eps ] , we compare our results of model light curves in the r and v bands viewing from the side of the companion star ( @xmath56 ) with two well observed type ia sne 2011fe and 2014j .",
    "though the early light curve of sn 2014j is of unfiltered observations or of approximate @xmath57 magnitudes estimated from narrowband detections using h@xmath58 filters@xcite , the shape indicates some influence from the collision between the sn ejecta and the companion star .",
    "therefore sn 2014j might have a red giant as the ex - companion star and prefers the sd scenario .",
    "note that we do not intend to fit the observed light curve of sn 2014j with our current models .",
    "a detailed comparison will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we calculate spectra with several viewing angles @xmath59 every 5 days up to 40 days since explosion .",
    "figures  [ spectra-ms-2.eps]-[spectra-rgb-2.eps ] show spectrum of each model . here",
    "the monochromatic luminosity @xmath60 is normalized by the continuum luminosity @xmath61 . in the early spectra ,",
    "strong absorption features come from c ii line ( @xmath62  ) and si ii line ( @xmath63  ) . on the other hand ,",
    "h@xmath0 feature is quite weak or hidden by the c ii absorption , because w7 model retains a large amount of carbon in the outer ejecta . in reality , c ii absorption features are weak and rarely detected in observed sn ia spectra @xcite .",
    "we overestimate their absorption feature and therefore there is a possibility to detect h@xmath0 feature in some sne ia depending on the carbon content and the viewing angle .",
    "especially , model ms has a strong h@xmath0 feature on its spectra before day 10 and after day 30 .",
    "as was mentioned before , the overestimate of the stripped mass in this model enhances the feature as compared with reality . in models",
    "rga and rgb , h@xmath0 absorption becomes prominent only after day 30 . on the other hand ,",
    "c ii feature already becomes weak in this epoch and does not disturb the h@xmath0 feature .",
    "the s / n ratio needed for the 3@xmath64 detection of these features is written as @xmath65 at day 35 , the s / n ratio to detect the most strong feature in the spectrum is calculated as 59 for model rga , and 125 for model rgb .",
    "figure  [ ew.eps ] shows the time evolution of the equivalent width of h@xmath0 line .",
    "the peak value of the equivalent width with the viewing angle @xmath28 is 6  for model ms , 5  for model rga , and 4  for model rgb . with @xmath66 ,",
    "the peak value decreases by a factor of about two compared with the above value in each model .",
    "thus , in models rga and rgb , the h@xmath0 feature can be detected when the viewing angle is in the range of @xmath67 , or within the solid angle of @xmath68 .",
    "the event ratio in each model is estimated as @xmath69 . however",
    ", this h@xmath0 feature has never been observed in sn ia spectra .",
    "thus , these systems are ruled out from the progenitor candidates . here , it should be noted that these calculations assume that the ionization states are in thermal equilibrium and that we need to know the continuum spectra with sufficient accuracies in advance .",
    "@xcite already discussed hydrogen lines in this late phase in more detail including the paschen lines . as another spectral feature to be investigated",
    ", figure  [ vel-si.eps ] shows time evolution of silicon velocity with different viewing angles .",
    "the differences of velocities between @xmath44 and @xmath48 are about @xmath70 for all models .",
    "a spectral resolution of about 20  could distinguish the differences .",
    "this variation occurs because the edge of the ejecta is decelerated and masked by the companion star .",
    "we usually observe a sn from a single direction and it is difficult to distinguish this effect from the variety of expansion speeds of individual sne ia .",
    "one possibility to extract this effect is a sn ia for which a several light echoes are discovered .",
    "they will have different silicon velocities depending on the viewing angles , and can be compared with our results .",
    "@xcite obtained a light echo spectrum of snr tycho with the spectral resolution of 24 , observed by the focas camera on the subaru telescope .",
    "the resolution we require is higher .",
    "furthermore , the light echo spectrum is constructed by a mixture of sn spectra for about 10 days .",
    "thus , it is not feasible to detect the variation at present .",
    "these spectral features confirmed the results obtained by more sophisticated treatment of radiative transfer in the same models @xcite except that the temporal evolution of silicon line .",
    "@xcite obtained the silicon velocities independent of viewing angles at day @xmath71 while we always see lower velocities when viewing from the companion side",
    ". this difference might be partly due to different treatments of the shock heating .",
    "@xcite redetermined the temperature by imposing the radiative equilibrium condition ignoring the shock heating .",
    "higher temperature due to the shock heating reduces the number of si ii ions and lowers the velocities at the absorption minima .",
    "in later phases , the adiabatic cooling diminishes contributions of the shock heating and the results of the two different simulations converge .",
    "in the sd scenario of sne ia , the collision between the ejecta and its companion occurs . due to this collision ,",
    "their light curve and spectra are changed from the case of sn ia without the companion .",
    "these characteristics are expected to constrain progenitor systems . in this study",
    ", we perform radiation hydrodynamical simulations of this collision for three binary systems in the sd scenario . using the obtained snapshots , we solve the radiation transport equation , and obtain their light curves and spectra with several viewing angles .",
    "then , we determine whether they can constrain the event rate of the sd progenitor .",
    "the results are as follows .    in comparison to @xcite , the prompt emission due to",
    "the collision becomes weaker , since the photospheric temperature becomes lower by the weaker coupling of gas and radiation . in models",
    "ms and rga , the luminosity does not exceed that of the @xmath2 main sequence model in @xcite , above which the emission can be detected in observed sne ia . on the contrary , in model rgb",
    ", the luminosity still exceeds the threshold .",
    "thus , we conclude that binary systems with the separation @xmath72 is allowed as a progenitor of sne ia . as exemplified by sn 2014j , photometric observations during the first few days for a large sample of sne are crucial for distinguishing the two scenarios .    in all models ,",
    "the equivalent widths of h@xmath0 absorption become a few   30 days after the explosion .",
    "however , in model ms , the stripped mass is overestimated and the absorption will become weaker in reality .",
    "on the other hand , in models rga and rgb , the h@xmath0 feature can be detected if the viewing angle @xmath67 .",
    "then , 2% of sne ia in these models should have the feature on their spectra , while there is no sign of h@xmath0 absorption in the observed spectra .",
    "if a sufficient number of spectra were obtained with good s / n ratios and were not showed this feature , a model with a red giant companion filling the roche lobe could be ruled out from sne ia progenitors .",
    "the central wavelength of si ii absorption varies depending on viewing angles .",
    "if more than one light echoes are discovered in a single sn , we obtain its spectra with different viewing angles .",
    "since the difference of silicon velocities depending on the viewing angles is about @xmath70 , the required resolution is about 20 .",
    "the current observation has not reached this resolution for light echo spectra .",
    "we need higher resolution which will be reached by future observations .",
    "as shown above , our models indicate that the prompt emission can not constrain binary systems with a short separation .",
    "one should note here that our models may significantly underestimate the luminosity due to the shock heating because we do not take into account the coupling of radiation and gas through compton scattering .",
    "thus we need to address the effects of compton scattering before reaching a conclusion on this issue . at the same time",
    ", we also found that the spectral feature might constrain the occurrence of thermalization through compton scattering .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath0 feature brings us additional information of the progenitor of an individual sn ia . because we can not predict where and when a sn will occur , the prompt emission is difficult to be found .",
    "it will be detected only when a monitoring telescope is occasionally viewing around its site .",
    "in contrast , some hydrogen features become prominent after the maximum light , which relaxes the required observing cadence .",
    "if we continuously observe the sn and take spectra with a right viewing angle , we will never miss it .",
    "this is a great advantage ."
