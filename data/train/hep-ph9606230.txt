    "the measurement of the total cross section for electron positron annihilation into hadrons allows for a unique test of pertubative qcd .",
    "the decay rate @xmath5 provides one of the most precise determinations of the strong coupling constant @xmath6 . in the high energy limit",
    "the quark masses can often be neglected . in this approximation",
    "qcd corrections to @xmath7 have been calculated up to order @xmath8 @xcite . for precision measurements the dominant mass corrections",
    "must be included through an expansion in @xmath9 .",
    "terms up to order @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite are available at present , providing an acceptable approximation from the high energy region down to intermediate energy values . for a number of measurements , however , the information on the complete mass dependence is desirable .",
    "this includes charm and bottom meson production above the resonance region , say above @xmath12  gev and @xmath13  gev , respectively , and of course top quark production at a future electron positron collider .    to order @xmath6 this calculation",
    "was performed by klln and sabry in the context of qed a long time ago @xcite . with measurements of ever increasing precision , predictions in order @xmath14 are needed for a reliable comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "furthermore , when one tries to apply the @xmath15 result to qcd , with its running coupling constant , the choice of scale becomes important .",
    "in fact , the distinction between the two intrinsically different scales , the relative momentum versus the center of mass energy , is crucial for a stable numerical prediction .",
    "this information can be obtained from a full calculation to order @xmath14 only .",
    "such a calculation then allows to predict the cross section in the complete energy region where perturbative qcd can be applied  from close to threshold up to high energies .",
    "the two - loop result had been calculated in analytical form @xcite in terms of polylogarithms .",
    "the strategy employed in @xcite was based on a direct evaluation of the imaginary part of the vacuum polarization ( and thus of the cross section ) in a first step followed by the calculation of the real part via dispersion relations .",
    "in fact , this strategy was also applied in the two - loop calculation of the polarization function @xmath16 for the unequal mass case which enters e.g. the @xmath17 parameter @xcite .",
    "the same holds true for a special class of three - loop contributions @xcite to @xmath16 which are present in qed and qcd as well  those induced by massless fermion loop insertions into the internal gluon propagator .",
    "the imaginary part was calculated in terms of polylogarithms with a method fairly similar to the one employed in order @xmath18 , with infrared cutoffs introduced to calculate separately real and virtual contributions .",
    "however , the calculation techniques of @xcite were tailored to the `` double bubble '' topology and can not be generalized to those which arise for purely photonic or gluonic corrections .",
    "a complete different approach has been employed for example in the original calculations of the @xmath1 corrections to @xmath19 for massless quarks : the full analytical function @xmath0 is calculated first , and the imaginary part is obtained as a trivial by - product . the pitfalls from infrared divergencies due to the separation into real and virtual radiation are thus circumvented .",
    "however , the feynman integrals to be solved are generally not available in closed analytical form once the quark masses are different from zero .",
    "we will demonstrate in this paper that this drawback can be circumvented by numerical methods which allow to calculate real and imaginary part simultaneously .",
    "those methods exploit again heavily the analyticity of @xmath0 .",
    "important ingredients are the leading terms of the expansion in the high energy region @xmath20 , the taylor series around @xmath21 which has been evaluated up to terms of order @xmath22 and information about the structure of @xmath16 in the threshold region .",
    "the method can be tested in the case of the `` double bubble '' diagrams against the known analytical result with highly satisfactory results . increasing the number of terms in the large and small @xmath23 region ,",
    "the @xmath0 can be reconstructed with arbitrary precision .",
    "however , the results presented below should be sufficiently precise for comparison with experimental results in the forseable future .",
    "the contributions @xmath24 and @xmath25 have to be treated separately since they differ significantly in their singularity structure . for each of the three functions an interpolation",
    "is constructed which incorporates all data and is based on conformal mapping and pad approximation suggested in @xcite .",
    "since the result for @xmath26 is available in closed form the approximation method can be tested and shown to give excellent result for this case .",
    "reliable predictions for @xmath19 to order @xmath14 and arbitrary @xmath9 are thus available .    in this paper only results without renormalization group improvement and resummation of the coulomb singularities from higher orders are presented .",
    "resummation of leading higher order terms , phenomenological applications and a more detailed discussion of our methods will be presented elsewhere .",
    "this work decribes the used method in detail and extends the analysis from @xcite , where mainly results were presented .",
    "it is organized as follows : the notation and a brief layout of our methods are presented in section [ secnot ] .",
    "the large @xmath23 behaviour of @xmath16 is listed in section [ seclar ] , the ansatz for the threshold singularities in section [ secthr ] .",
    "most of the calculational efforts were spent on the evaluation of the seven lowest taylor coefficients of @xmath0 presented in section [ secsma ] . as a simple application of the result for the first taylor coefficient the contribution of a massive quark to the relation between the qed coupling constant in the @xmath27 and the on - shell scheme is presented in section [ secqed ] .",
    "an approximation which makes use of the analyticity structure of @xmath16 and the results of section [ seclar ]  [ secsma ] is constructed in section [ secoptappr ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ secres ] , together with compact representations in terms of simple functions .",
