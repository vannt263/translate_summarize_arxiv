    "stellar li abundances are at once very informative and difficult to interpret .",
    "this follows from the relative delicacy of li nuclei in the shallow surface layers of stars , where they are destroyed via @xmath1 reactions when they are mixed to regions with warm protons .",
    "li abundances in dwarf star photospheres are observed to correlate with effective temperature ( t@xmath2 ) , age , rotation , binarity and metallicity .",
    "however , even within a single coeval population ( such as the open cluster m67 ) variations in li abundance are observed among stars that otherwise appear identical @xcite .",
    "some have suggested that the presence of a protoplanetary disk is the missing parameter that accounts for the observed spread in li abundances among similar stars .",
    "the the surface li abundance of a star could be altered via accretion of protoplanetary disk material @xcite or via a change in its rotation @xcite .",
    "thus , while li has the potential to serve as a useful probe of stellar and planetary processes , their effects on li abundances are difficult to disentangle given our present level of understanding .",
    "nevertheless , several studies have attempted to isolate the effects of planets on li abundance .",
    "@xcite first suggested that stars with planets ( swps ) , when corrected for simple linear trends with t@xmath2 , metallicity or [ m / h ] as a proxy for stellar metallicity . ] and age , display smaller li abundances than field stars .",
    "@xcite examined the li abundance trends more carefully and concluded that any possible differences were not significant .",
    "@xcite , employing a larger sample , agreed with his conclusion .",
    "@xcite revisited this topic and reported a significant depletion of li among swps relative to a comparison star sample , but only in the t@xmath2 range 5600 to 5850 k. @xcite largely confirmed their findings for the t@xmath2 range 5800 to 5900 k. @xcite , restricting their attention to t@xmath3 5600 to 5900 k , also confirmed the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite , employing a larger comparison star sample , did not find a significant difference between swps and a comparison sample .",
    "they attribute the li abundance difference found by @xcite to a systematic difference in the temperature scales in their study and the study of @xcite , the results of which they had used to supplement their small comparison sample .",
    "most recently , @xcite measured li in 118 nearby solar analogs . while they included only a few swps in their study , they again concluded that swps tend to have smaller li abundances .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to resolve the conflicting findings concerning li abundances in swps .",
    "it continues our series of studies on the chemical abundances of nearby swps ( for a summary of previous papers , see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "we combined the chemical abundance data from multiple studies in a consistent way and compared the chemical abundances of swps and comparison stars for several elements ; we did not include li in the comparison , because it requires a fundamentally different analysis .",
    "we employ similar methods in the present study . in section 2",
    "we present new samples of swps and comparison stars formed by combining the li abundance results from multiple studies . in section 3",
    "we use these new samples to determine whether swps have different li abundances than stars without detected planets .",
    "we also examine vsini and the @xmath0 activity index in swps .",
    "we discuss our findings within the context of planet formation models in section 4 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in @xcite we presented the results of our chemical abundance analyses of 18 elements ( including li ) in 31 swps .",
    "we also calculated corrections needed to place our data and the data from other similar studies on the same abundance scale .",
    "this procedure allowed us to construct larger and more accurate swp and comparison star samples , which we employed to compare c , o , na , mg , al , si , ca , sc , ti and ni abundances . we concluded that there is evidence for significant differences between the two samples for some elements .",
    "we adopted a similar procedure for li .",
    "we begin with the li abundance values listed in table 1 of @xcite for 31 swps . to these data we added li abundance values ( and upper limits ) of other swps from our previous papers .",
    "we excluded swps with t@xmath4 k and @xmath5 g @xmath6 .",
    "the derived stellar properties tend to be less accurate for cooler stars , and few stars with t@xmath4 k have detectable li .",
    "the limit on surface gravity restricts the sample to main sequence stars ; a star that has evolved off the main sequence onto the subgiant or giant branch undergoes dramatic changes in its internal structure that results in changes in the surface li abundance . having applied these limits , the total number of swps with li abundances ( and upper limits ) from our studies comes to 52 .",
    "next , we compiled li abundances ( and upper limits ) for swps with t@xmath7 k and @xmath5 g @xmath8 from the following studies ( number of swps retained from each study is also indicated ) : @xcite  83 , @xcite  48 , @xcite  27 , @xcite  5 . the same studies include li abundances for stars without planets ; the totals ( after applying the same limits ) are : @xcite  34 , @xcite  112 , @xcite  98 , @xcite  113 .",
    "we selected these studies for analysis because they have similar temperature scales , and their data are of comparable quality .",
    "one complication that we did not have to consider for the elements examined in @xcite is the presence of upper limits in the abundance data .",
    "the minimum detectable li abundance varies among the studies we employed , because their spectra have differing s / n ratios .",
    "the li abundance values from our series of studies typically have the lowest upper limits , while those from @xcite have the highest ( but the upper limits from the other studies are not much lower ) .",
    "we show the stars from @xcite that have li abundance upper limits in figure 1 .",
    "we also include in the figure a straight line that matches the upper envelope of the upper limits for t@xmath9 k ; it is described by the equation @xmath5 li @xmath10 t@xmath2 .",
    "we will employ this line as a cutoff for selecting li abundance values to include in our final sample preparation below .",
    "next , we selected the @xcite study as the reference and adjusted the data from the other studies to be consistent with it .",
    "first , we adjusted the t@xmath2 values in each study by applying a simple linear equation calibrated using swps in common between it and @xcite .",
    "we then adjusted the @xmath5 g values using a linear equation including a term with the adjusted t@xmath2 values .",
    "the adjustments to [ fe / h ] and li are simple constant offsets ; typical [ fe / h ] and li abundance offsets are about 0.02 and 0.05 dex , respectively .",
    "the cutoff line shown in figure 1 is only valid for t@xmath9 k , since two of the stars without planets from @xcite above this temperature have upper limits much higher than predicted from the extrapolated cutoff line .",
    "one possible reason for this discrepancy is the fact that faster rotation is more common among earlier spectral type dwarfs , resulting in broader , shallower absorption lines .",
    "therefore , in our second cut of the data , we removed stars with t@xmath11 k ; we also excluded stars with t@xmath12 k , given the paucity of swps with detected li in this range .",
    "our upper t@xmath2 limit also excludes stars that might display the li dip phenomenon ( see @xcite ) , which would further complicate our analysis below .",
    "finally , we excluded all the stars with @xmath5 li values falling below the cutoff line ( whether upper limits or detections ) .     for swps ( dots ) and stars without planets ( open circles ) from @xcite .",
    "the upper limit cutoff curve is shown as a dashed line.,width=336 ]    for those stars present in multiple studies , we calculated simple averages of their parameters .",
    "we show the resulting li abundances plotted against t@xmath2 in figure 2 .",
    "the final samples include 37 swps and 147 stars lacking planets .",
    "the corrected individual t@xmath2 values differ from the @xcite values with a typical dispersion of about @xmath13 70 k. the corresponding dispersion for @xmath5 g is about @xmath13 0.13 dex , while for [ fe / h ] and @xmath5 li they are @xmath13 0.03 and @xmath13 0.08 dex , respectively .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the quoted typical measurement uncertainties in the individual studies .",
    "of course , the standard error of the mean ( s.e.m . )",
    "values for the average values of these quantities for those stars included in multiple studies are smaller .    .",
    "symbols have the same meanings as in figure 1.,width=336 ]",
    "objective comparisons between the li abundances of swps and comparison stars have proven to be difficult .",
    "some studies have done nothing more than simple visual comparisons on a plot like figure 2 , while others have attempted to correct for differences in t@xmath2 , [ fe / h ] and chromospheric activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we propose a new approach to comparing these samples .",
    "observations of stars in open clusters and in the field indicate that li abundances are most sensitive to t@xmath2 and age ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the rate of li destruction in a star s envelope should be sensitive to [ fe / h ] , since a star s convection zone is deeper for larger [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "for each star in our samples we have t@xmath2 , @xmath5 g , [ fe / h ] and m@xmath14 , all corrected for small systematic differences among the various studies .",
    "isochrone - based stellar ages can be derived from the t@xmath2 , [ fe / h ] and m@xmath14 values , and this has been done in several studies of swps ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "uniform age estimates are not available for all the stars in our swp and comparison star samples .",
    "however , our method of comparison does not require that we calculate ages .",
    "instead , we calculate an index that is a measure of the proximity of two stars in t@xmath2 , @xmath5 g , [ fe / h ] , m@xmath14-space . it is based on the following equation :    @xmath15}^{\\rm comp } - { \\rm [ fe / h]}^{\\rm p } \\vert \\\\",

    "therefore , two stars with identical ages , masses and compositions will also have a @xmath16 value of zero .",
    "our motivation in choosing these particular coefficients is to give comparable contributions to @xmath16 from each term for two stars that differ by about 2@xmath17 in each parameter .",
    "we increased the contribution of the @xmath5 t@xmath2 term , however , to account for its greater importance in determining the li abundance . and",
    ", we reduced the contribution of @xmath5 g , given the relatively lesser importance of this quantity .",
    "we calculated @xmath16 for each swp relative to each comparison star , resulting in 5439 values . for each swp , we then selected the comparison star with the smallest value of @xmath16 .",
    "we plot the differences in li abundances between each swp and the closest matching comparison star in figure 3a .",
    "one weakness of this approach is that only a small subset of the data is used to calculate the differences in the li abundances .",
    "these results are sensitive to outliers .",
    "we can improve upon our analysis as follows . in our second approach we calculated",
    "weighted average values of li abundance differences for each swp using all the comparison star data .",
    "the weights are given by @xmath18 .",

    "although the effect is small , vsini apparently does have an effect on the li abundances of swps . to further explore the relationship between vsini and the presence of planets , we calculated vsini differences using the @xmath16 index .",

    "the pattern of li abundance differences between swps and comparison stars shows a remarkable correspondence with the pattern of differences in vsini .",
    "both li and vsini are smaller for cool swps and larger for hot swps .",
    "these results confirm the preliminary finding of @xcite that solar analogs with slower rotation have lower li abundances .",
    "they reached this conclusion after having conducted detailed spectroscopic analyses of 118 solar analogs .",
    "they measured line widths , which allowed them to determine vsini+macroturbulence for each star .",
    "unlike @xcite , however , they did not determine separate vsini and macroturbulence velocities .",
    "what s more , they only included 5 swps in their sample , limiting their conclusions about the possible relationship between swps , rotation and li abundance .",
    "stellar chromospheric activity is known to correlate with rotation .",
    "if the pattern in vsini values we found among the swps is a real effect , then there should be similar patterns in measures of chromospheric activity .",
    "we can test this prediction using the @xmath0 chromospheric activity index , which has been measured for many sun - like stars .",
    "the best source of @xmath0 values for our purposes is @xcite .",
    "they tabulate @xmath0 values for the stars included in the @xcite study . in our first cut of the data , we cross referenced the stars in @xcite with those in @xcite to produce new samples of swps and comparison stars . after applying our t@xmath2 and @xmath5 g cuts , we produced samples of 52 swps and 411 comparison stars .",
    "we show the resulting @xmath0 differences in figure 8 , calculated using the @xmath16 index .",
    "as expected from the vsini results , swps tend to have smaller @xmath0 values . from the results shown in figure 8b",

    "differences versus t@xmath2 for swps and comparison stars from @xcite and @xcite.,width=336 ]    we should note that some scatter in the vsini and @xmath0 difference plots is expected . first , the equatorial velocity of a star is viewed from random angles .",
    "second , like the sun most fgk dwarfs display variable @xmath0 .    before we can attribute these results to physical causes , we need to consider the possible effects of biases .",
    "one important bias is the variation in the s / n ratio of the spectra , which we already discussed in section 2 .",
    "we dealt with it by excluding stars with li abundances below the level where they could be uniformly determined .",
    "other biases are caused by differences in vsini and chromospheric activity , which affect the detectability of planets with the doppler method ( all the swps included in our comparisons above were discovered with the doppler method ) .",
    "a large vsini value results in broad lines , and a large value of @xmath0 is accompanied by greater photospheric  jitter , \" which is a source of noise in doppler measurements @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria of planet search groups includes a requirement that the spectra be sufficiently sharp - lined to detect the small doppler shifts induced by an orbiting planet .",
    "spectroscopic analyses of the type used to derive the basic stellar parameters ( including li abundance ) also require sharp - lined spectra . therefore ,",
    "both the swp and comparison star samples exclude stars with large vsini and @xmath0 values .    in order to test for possible swp selection bias resulting from stellar activity",
    ", we produced a second set of swp and comparison stars samples .",
    "this time we excluded stars with @xmath38 dex ; this is the largest value of @xmath36 measured for an swp ( hd 22049 ; @xcite quote a value of @xmath39 dex , while @xcite quote a value of @xmath40 dex ) .",
    "this second set contains the same number of swps ( hd 22049 is too cool to have been included in our swp samples ) and 393 comparison stars .",
    "we plot these data in figure 9 .",
    "the average difference in @xmath36 for the swp data in figure 9b with t@xmath2 between 5800 and 5950 k is @xmath41  ( s.e.m . ) dex .",
    "therefore , the activity bias can only account for a small part of the difference in @xmath0 between swps and comparison stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that the star with the largest positive anomaly in figures 8b and 9b , hd 179949 , is the best candidate for star - planet magnetic interactions .",
    "@xcite reported significant synchronous enhancement of ca ii h and k emission with the planet in orbit around the star .",
    ".,width=336 ]    we also consider the vsini bias to have negligible effect on our results .",
    "first , the stars in the @xcite spocs database have median and maximum vsini values of 2.4 and 54.7 km  s@xmath27 , respectively , and only 44 stars have vsini values greater than 11 km  s@xmath27 .",
    "only about 5 per cent of the comparison stars have vsini values greater than that of the swp in the spocs sample with the largest vsini value ( hd 120136 with vsini @xmath42 km  s@xmath27 ) . in addition , all the stars in the spocs database with vsini values above 16.5 km  s@xmath27 are beyond the upper cutoff in t@xmath2 ( 6250 k ) that we employed in our sample preparations .",
    "second , given that it would be more difficult to detect planets around stars with the highest vsini values , we would expect the swps sample to have a smaller average vsini value than a comparison sample that included stars with higher vsini values .",
    "however , we actually find that swps have positive vsini anomalies for t@xmath43 k , the very range having the highest vsini values in the spocs database .",
    "third , vsini tends to decline with age .",
    "therefore , if the swp sample is significantly older than the comparison star sample , then the observed vsini values of the swps will be smaller than those in the comparison sample .",
    "we have greatly minimized this possible source of bias in our analysis above . by weighting the vsini and li abundance differences according to the similarities of the stars , we are , in effect , comparing stars that are similar in age .",
    "@xcite also excluded spectroscopic binaries and chromospherically very active stars .",
    "again , we do nt consider these biases to significantly affect our results for the reasons we gave above .",
    "are the li abundance differences caused by differences in rotation or are they both caused by something else ?",
    "the results shown in figure 5b imply that vsini can not fully explain the differences in li abundance .",
    "the more likely explanation for the correlation between li and rotation among swps is that both are the result of process related to planet formation .",
    "this is not the first time li abundance has been linked with rotation in stars .",
    "the low li abundances observed over a narrow temperature range centered near spectral type f5 on the main sequence ( called the li dip ) are accompanied by low vsini values ; a similar phenomenon is observed among giants and subgiants at lower t@xmath2 in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "@xcite suggests that the simultaneous decrease of both li and rotation velocity in these two classes of stars is caused by evolutionary changes leading to deep mixing , which destroys li at the higher temperatures at the base of the envelope and redistributes angular momentum .",
    "in addition , li is known to be preserved in short period synchronously rotating binaries , confirming stellar models that include rotationally induced mixing @xcite .",
    "clearly , processes that affect mixing at the base of convection zone must be included in any theory offered to explain the correlation between li abundance and rotation .",
    "@xcite proposed two hypotheses to account for the low li abundances they measured for swps with t@xmath2 near 5800 k. first , they suggested that since the protoplanetary disk around a young star contains a large fraction of the system s angular momentum , it can cause rotational breaking of the star .",
    "the breaking , in turn , results in deeper mixing in the star and thus more efficient destruction of li .",
    "second , in a system with a migrating giant planet , tidal forces from the planet could create a shear instability at the interface between the convective and radiative zones , leading to more mixing and hence destruction of li .",
    "our results for swps near 5800 k confirm the correlation between li abundance and rotation based on the first hypothesis .",
    "testing the second hypothesis would require examining the orbits of the planets as well . to be effective ,",
    "such an analysis should employ a larger sample than ours .    any theory must also account for the higher li abundances and faster rotation we found for the swps near 6200 k. in this temperature regime the mass of the convection zone is much smaller . such a star might have weaker coupling to the protoplanetary disk .",
    "in addition , a less massive convection zone would be more susceptible to alteration of the surface composition by accretion of refractory material @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the anomalous chemical abundance pattern ( including extremely high li and be abundances ) of the early f dwarf j37 in ngc 6633 is best explained by accretion of chondritic material .",
    "this `` self - enrichment '' process could account for the li excesses ( though much smaller in magnitude ) we found for the late f swps . in this context",
    "it is notable that @xcite found be abundance excesses near 0.1 dex relative to comparison stars for swps between 6000 and 6200 k. this is comparable to the li excesses we determined for the same stars .",
    "unfortunately , they only observed two comparison stars in this temperature range , so their results should be considered as preliminary . finally , accretion should also increase the @xmath44li abundance in a star s atmosphere , possibly to detectable levels @xcite .",
    "the self - enrichment hypothesis could also account for the higher vsini values of the hotter swps .",
    "a migrating planet orbits its host star in the same direction as it rotates . as material falls onto the star ( whether small planetary building blocks or planets ) , it adds angular momentum to the star s envelope .",
    "we prepared new swp and comparison star samples by combining published spectroscopic data in a consistent way .",
    "our analyses confirm those recent studies that have reported smaller li abundances for swps near 5800 k. in addition , the data suggest that swps with t@xmath2 near 6100 k have excess li abundances .",
    "the transition occurs near t@xmath45 k.    we also find that the patterns of vsini and @xmath0 anomalies with t@xmath2 correlate with the li anomalies ; the vsini and @xmath0 values are smaller among the cooler swps .",
    "the low li abundance , vsini and @xmath0 values among the cool swps is consistent with the suggestion that a protoplanetary disk causes rotational breaking of its host star , leading to additional mixing in its envelope .",
    "the additional mixing , in turn , accelerates the destruction of li in the star s envelope . on the other hand ,",
    "the preliminary finding of high li abundance and vsini values of the hot swps can be counted as evidence for the self - enrichment hypothesis .",
    "additional measurements of be and @xmath46li in swps and stars without planets near t@xmath47 k can help us test the self - enrichment hypothesis for swps in this temperature range .",
    "the number of swps with detected li is still relatively small .",
    "the present situation can be improved by conducting detailed spectroscopic analyses on the more recently discovered swps .",
    "in addition , several published studies of swps are based on spectra of modest s / n ratio ( @xmath48 ) , preventing detection of li in many of the cooler stars .",
    "it would be straightforward to obtain spectra of higher s / n ( @xmath49 ) for these stars .",
    "it would also be helpful to observe additional stars without detected planets with comparable s / n ratio .",
    "our findings bring to five the number of stellar parameters that correlate with the presence of doppler detected planets : metallicity , mass , li abundance , vsini and @xmath0 .",
    "there might also be additional secondary parameters , such as the @xmath44li/@xmath50li isotope ratio and al / fe and si / fe abundances ratios , but these require confirmation .",
    "taken together , these five parameters should make it possible to select stars with a high probability of hosting planets .",
    "we thank the anonymous reviewer for helpful comments and suggestions .",
