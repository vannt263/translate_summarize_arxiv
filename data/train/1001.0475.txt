    "the inception of the idea of a possible time variation of the gravitational constant @xmath1 by dirac  @xcite and subsequent supportive works , both at theoretical  @xcite and observational  @xcite level opened up a new pathway in cosmological research .",
    "numerous works in this direction have been done by taking @xmath1 as a variable .",
    "after the discovery of the scenario of accelerating universe  @xcite , investigations within the framework of variable @xmath1 is also not uncommon in the literature .",
    "one of the techniques of dark energy investigation is to include a @xmath0 term in the field equations of einstein . since a constant @xmath0 is handicapped by the well known cosmological constant problem and coincidence problem , so it is not unnatural to consider @xmath0 as a variable quantity .",
    "when the @xmath0 term is placed in the right hand side of the field equations and is considered as a part of the energy - momentum tensor , then instead of @xmath6 , the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 is conserved . on the other hand , as an extension of dirac s large number hypothesis ( lnh ) , zeldovich  @xcite established a connection ( to be shown explicitly afterwards ) between the cosmological parameter @xmath0 and the gravitational constant @xmath1 by considering @xmath0 as the gravitational energy of the vacuum .",
    "so , variability of @xmath0 admits the variability of @xmath1 also provided one considers the other quantities of the relation of zeldovich  @xcite as constant .    as a part of dark energy investigation , ray et al .",
    "@xcite considered @xmath0 models in four dimensional space - time by taking @xmath1 as time - dependent .",
    "so , it is not unnatural to make an attempt for exploring new physical features by venturing into dimensions higher than the usual @xmath8 .",
    "this is the motivation behind the present work where a @xmath9 dimensional study of time - dependent @xmath0 model has been done within the framework of variable @xmath1 .",
    "we have addressed here some key issues of modern cosmology , viz .",
    "the age problem , the amount of variation of @xmath1 and the nature of expansion of the universe .",
    "the scheme of the study is as follows : section 2 deals with field equations and their solutions while some physical features arising out of this investigation are described in different subsections of section 3 .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in section 4 .",
    "the @xmath9 dimensional metric for homogeneous and isotropic universe is given by @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the scale factor and @xmath12 for a flat ( @xmath13 ) universe , the above metric yields the field equations given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the barotropic equation of state is given by @xmath18 where the barotropic index @xmath19 , assumed to be constant here , can take the values @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for pressureless dust , electromagnetic radiation , stiff ( zeldovich ) fluid and vacuum fluid respectively .",
    "some other limits on @xmath19 coming from sn ia data  @xcite and a combination of sn ia data with cmb anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics  @xcite are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "now , the relation of zeldovich  @xcite between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] then , for pressureless dust ( @xmath71 ) we get from equation ( 19 ) , @xmath72 it has been already shown that in four dimensional case ( @xmath42 ) we can get the exact age of the universe , so far as observational results are concerned , for @xmath53 .",
    "now , for @xmath42 and @xmath53 we get @xmath73 which means that the universe expands with a uniform velocity .",
    "so , we are not getting an accelerating universe what the present cosmological scenario demands .",
    "another interesting point is , corresponding to every value of @xmath30 for which we get the exact age , we get the value of @xmath68 as zero whatever may be the spatial dimension .",
    "this means that the universe expands with uniformly in every dimension .",
    "this situation can be compared with the so called ` hesitation period ' ( when the quasars were supposed to be formed ) of the eddington - lematr model . while in the eddington - lematr model the universe behaves like de - sitter model for large @xmath74 , here the universe expands uniformly for all the time .",
    "however , an accelerating universe can be obtained from this model also under proper tuning of  @xmath30 .",
    "for example , in four dimensional case ( @xmath42 ) with pressureless dust , @xmath68 becomes @xmath75 for @xmath76 and in that case the age of the universe comes out as @xmath77 gyr which is not an unreasonable estimate .",
    "similar is the case for all other dimensions.it may be mentioned here that khadekar and butey  @xcite also obtained @xmath73 for @xmath78 where under the assumption @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 being constants it is interesting to note here that for all those tuned values of @xmath30 which give us the exact age of the universe , the scale factor increases linearly .",
    "it may be mentioned here that linear expansion in a robertson - walker universe is shown to be possible also by usmani et al .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 model @xmath82 .",
    "in the present work , some new features of an widely used @xmath0-dark energy model has been explored through an ( @xmath2 ) dimensional analysis with variable @xmath0 and variable @xmath1 .",
    "recently khadekar and butey  @xcite have studied a similar higher dimensional cosmological model where both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are variable . while khadekar and butey  @xcite have chosen @xmath1 by following eddington - weinberg empirical relation  @xcite and singh  @xcite , here in the present case a particular relation of zeldovich s",
    "@xcite in connection to the cosmological parameter is used for obtaining an expression for the so - called gravitational constant .",
    "the approach of the present work is also completely different from that of khadekar and butey  @xcite .    in the present investigation",
    "we have been addressed , by using a well known @xmath0 model , some key issues of modern cosmology , viz .",
    "the age problem , the amount of variation of @xmath1 and the nature of expansion of the universe .",
    "the results we have shown are as follows :    \\(i ) for any dimension , the accepted age of the present universe can be attained under proper tuning of the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "\\(ii ) the amount of variation of the gravitational constant is shown to be compatible with theoretically and observationally established values without any prior assumption on the value of the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "this is an improvement over the work of ray and mukhopadhyay  @xcite where the fine - tuning of the parameters were essential for obtaining the currently accepted values so far as the amount of variation of @xmath1 is concerned .",
    "but , here no such precondition is required .",
    "\\(iii ) the present model has been successful in obtaining both negative and zero values of the deceleration parameter @xmath68 which correspond to accelerating and uniformly expanding universe respectively .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that although in the present work emphasis is given on the zero value of the equation of state parameter @xmath19 , but the present model also admits negative values of @xmath19 with the restriction @xmath83 .",
    "one of the authors ( sr ) is thankful to the authority of inter - university centre for astronomy and astrophysics , pune , india for providing visiting associateship under which a part of this work was carried out .",
