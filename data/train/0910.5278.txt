    "the averaged value @xmath21 of @xmath17 ( over all periodic points ) and the hausdorff dimension of @xmath0 , @xmath22 , satisfy @xmath23 . up to conformal transformations , @xmath0 is obtained from a curve of higher regularity and lower hausdorff dimension than @xmath0 , by replacing pieces of the more regular curve by increasingly rescaled basic `` bricks '' obtained from the transseries expression .",
    "this is analogous to the way elementary fractals such as the koch snowflake are obtained .",
