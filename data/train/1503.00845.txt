    "hadron spectroscopy is an essential part of the investigation to understand the non - perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in principle , an ab - initio approach to hadron resonance physics can be provided by lattice qcd simulations . in particular , the spectra of excited baryons observed in the recent lattice simulations  @xcite hold the promise of explaining the rich dynamics in the resonance energy region in the near future .",
    "once quark masses drop towards more reasonable values and finite volume effects are fully under control , a close comparison to experimental data will be possible .",
    "other approaches such as the dynamical dyson - schwinger  @xcite , constituent quark models  @xcite , and the skyrme model  @xcite also generate resonance spectra .",

    "a reliable reaction theory capable of identifying resonances and extracting the corresponding resonance parameters is required .",
    "such reaction theories , based on a coupled - channel approach , have been developed at various degrees of sophistication and are being improved  @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the experimentally extracted baryon resonances come from the pion - induced reaction experiments , especially the @xmath11 scattering , and about 16 nucleon resonances and 11 @xmath12 resonances have been identified  @xcite .",

    "although the multi - strangeness baryons ( @xmath16 ) have played an important role in the development of our understanding of strong interactions , and thus , should be an integral part of any baryon spectroscopy program , the current knowledge of these baryons is still extremely limited .",
    "in fact , the su(3 ) flavor symmetry allows as many @xmath17 baryon resonances , called @xmath18 , as there are @xmath19 and @xmath12 resonances combined ( @xmath20 ) ; however , until now , only eleven @xmath18 baryons have been discovered  @xcite . among them , only three [ ground state @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 have their quantum numbers assigned . has not been measured explicitly yet , but its assignment is based on quark models and su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "] this situation is mainly due to the fact that multi - strangeness particle productions have relatively low yields .",
    "for example , if there are no strange particles in the initial state , @xmath18 is produced only indirectly and the yield is only of the order of nb in the photoproduction reaction  @xcite , whereas the yield is of the order of @xmath24b  @xcite in the hadronic @xmath25-induced reaction , where the @xmath18 is produced directly because of the presence of an @xmath15 @xmath25 meson in the initial state .",

    ", we avoid the problems found in the usual implementations of tree - level effective lagrangian approaches that need to phenomenologically suppress @xmath2-channel contributions dominating the high - energy behavior  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ground states @xmath105 and @xmath111 , the present model also includes the @xmath3 , @xmath31 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 resonance contributions .",
    "the available total and differential cross sections , as well as the recoil asymmetry data , in both the @xmath7 and @xmath273 processes are well reproduced by the present model .",
    "we have found that the above - threshold resonances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are required to achieve a good fit quality for the data . among them , the @xmath4 resonance is the most critical one .",

    "the multi - strangess hyperon production programs using an intense antikaon beam at j - parc is of particular relevance in providing the much needed higher - precision data for the present reaction .",
    "the present analysis also reveals a peculiar behavior of the total cross section data in the threshold - energy region of the @xmath216 production channel , where the higher partial - waves ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) dominate instead of the usual @xmath10-wave ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ psigma ] ) .",
    "if this behavior of the cross section data is corroborated in future experiments , it will cast serious doubts on the validity of model calculations that neglect higher partial - waves even for energies very close to threshold .",
    "this peculiar low - energy behavior of the total cross section in @xmath25-induced reaction seems to be present also in the @xmath11 and @xmath231 production channels , in addition to the @xmath35 channel @xcite .",
    "apart from the recoil asymmetry , we have also predicted the target - recoil asymmetries for which there are currently no experimental data . in contrast to the recoil polarization  which are small  these observables are quite sizable and may help impose more stringent constraints on the model parameters . in principle , one requires the four independent observables calculated here to completely determine the reaction amplitude  @xcite .",
    "of course , measurements of the spin obervables , in particular , are challenging experimentally by any standard , but one may exploit the self - analyzing nature of the produced hyperon to help extract these observables  @xcite . for the target - recoil asymmetry measurements ,",
    "one requires a polarized target in addition to spin measurements of the produced @xmath18 . polarized targets available at some of the world s major laboratories combined with the availability of intense beams make measuring these spin observables no longer out of reach .",
    "in fact , various single- and double - polarization observables in photoproduction reactions are currently being measured at major facilities such as jlab , elsa , and mami , aiming at so - called complete experiment sets in order to model - independently determine the photoproduction amplitudes .",
    "while it may perhaps not be entirely clear which role any particular resonance plays for the @xmath276 reaction , the present and other calculations based on effective lagrangians  @xcite , and also the unitarized chiral perturbation approach  @xcite , seem to agree that some @xmath15 hyperon resonances seem to be required to reproduce the existing data . to pin down the role of a particular resonance among them",
    "requires more precise and complete data , in addition to more complete theoretical models . in any case",
    ", the present reaction is very well suited for studying @xmath15 hyperon resonances .",
    "finally , the present work is our first step toward building a more complete reaction theory to help analyze the data and extract the properties of @xmath18 resonances in future experimental efforts in @xmath18 baryon spectroscopy .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 reaction is studied for center - of - momentum energies ranging from threshold to 3  gev in an effective lagrangian approach that includes the hyperon @xmath1- and @xmath2-channel contributions as well as a phenomenological contact amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the latter accounts for the rescattering term in the scattering equation and possible short - range dynamics not included explicitly in the model . </S>",
    "<S> existing data are well reproduced and three above - the - threshold resonances were found to be required to describe the data , namely , the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . for the latter resonance we have assumed the spin - parity of @xmath6 and a mass of 2265  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 resonance is crucial in achieving a good reproduction of not only the measured total and differential cross sections , but also the recoil polarization asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> more precise data are required before a more definitive statement can be made about the other two resonances , in particular , about the @xmath5 resonance that is introduced to describe a small bump structure observed in the total cross section of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis also reveals a peculiar behavior of the total cross section data in the threshold energy region in @xmath7 , where the @xmath8- and @xmath9-waves dominate instead of the usual @xmath10-wave . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for the target - recoil asymmetries of the @xmath0 reaction are also presented . </S>"
