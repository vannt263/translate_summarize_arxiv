    "the idea that one may see a periodic lattice as built from interacting blocks of sites , rather than as interacting sites , is computationally and intellectually attractive and has received several exploitations .",
    "this process consists in a scale change .",
    "wilson s bright proposal of real space renormalization group ( rsrg)@xcite is certainly the most elegant illustration of this idea , since it can be infinitely iterated and asymptotically converges on physically meaningful accumulation points . the method in its original version consists in a simple and severe truncation of the hilbert space by considering only the lowest states of each block and the products of the selected block eigenfunctions to approach the eigenfunctions of blocks of blocks .",
    "the method happened to be numerically inefficient .",
    "recent works have shown that its performances can be dramatically improved when one defines effective interactions between the blocks .",
    "these effective interactions are calculated from the knowledge of the exact spectrum of the dimers ( or trimers ) of blocks using bloch s theory@xcite of effective hamiltonian .",
    "the so - called contractor renormalization ( core ) technique @xcite considers blocks , retains a few eigenstates @xmath0 of each block @xmath1 and defines inter - block effective interactions @xmath2 , using the spectrum of the @xmath3 problem and the bloch s theory@xcite of effective hamiltonians . in most applications",
    "the size of the blocks remains small , several states per blocks are kept , and three and / or four blocks effective interactions are introduced from the knowledge of the spectrum of trimers and / or tetramers of blocks .",
    "a specific variant of the method has been proposed by two of the authors under the name of rsrg - ei @xcite ( rsrg with effective interactions ) which treats spin lattices by considering blocks with an odd number of sites and a doublet ground state which is the only one to be explicitily retained .",
    "the blocks are then quasi - spin . from the spectrum of dimers or trimers of blocks",
    "one may define an inter - block heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "a proper design of the blocks frequently results in an isomorphism between the original lattice and the lattice of blocks .",
    "hence the process may be iterated , exhibiting critical ratios of the elementary interactions and accumulation points .",
    "the methodological studies have examined the following dilemma in the research of accuracy    * consider larger blocks and only dimers of blocks ( i.e. , two - body effective interactions only ) or * consider smaller blocks and trimers or tetramers ( i.e.,three and four blocks interactions )    showing that in most cases the former solution is sufficient . in a rather similar spirit one",
    "may mention the block correlated coupled cluster method@xcite which employs the coupled cluster formalism @xcite starting from the product of the ground state eigenfunctions for each block .",
    "a similar philosophy ( with small blocks ) is present in the applications of self - consistent perturbation formalism to periodic lattices.@xcite these last two methods do not provide information on the gaps , while core and rsrg - ei bring good estimates of them .    the present work is closely related but is focused on a direct research of the gap .",
    "one starts now from blocks constituted of an even number of sites and having a non - degenerate singlet ground state .",
    "the blocks may be identical or not , but they must lead to a periodic picture of the lattice in terms of blocks ( hence with larger unit cells ) .",
    "the ground state will be built from products of block ground states .",
    "considering the exact energies of dimers or trimers of blocks , one will define effective interactions between blocks in their ground states , producing an additive energy systematics .",
    "for the study of excited states , one will also consider the lowest states of the blocks and of the various dimers and eventually trimers of blocks .",
    "the knowledge of the lowest states of the dimers and trimers ( energy and eigenvectors ) enables one to define the effective interactions between an excited block and neighbor ground state blocks and effective excitation transfer integrals from one block to its neighbors .",
    "these quantities will be defined through the bloch s theory of effective hamiltonians .",
    "then the lattice lowest excitations are treated through an excitonic model that makes use of these effective quantities .",
    "the theory is developed in section ii .",
    "section iii first shows the improvement brought by the use of effective interactions rather than of bare interactions on elementary mono - electronic problems where the original rsrg version failed .",
    "the efficiency of the method will then be illustrated on three spin lattices , namely the 1-d frustrated chain , the 1/5-depleted 2-d square lattice and the plaquette lattice .",
    "the three problems exhibit phase transitions ( of second and first order ) which are satisfactorily treated with the here - proposed renormalized excitonic method ( rem ) .",
    "let us consider a lattice constituted of blocks @xmath4 having a non - degenerate singlet ground state .",

    "this will lead to an excitonic treatment of the excitation @xmath26 in order to establish the corresponding model hamiltonian one needs to calculate    * the effective interaction between an excited block and neighbor blocks in their ground state * the excitation hopping integrals which propagate an excitation from one block to other blocks .",

    "one sees that the derivation leads to a renormalized excitonic method , where the excitation transfer integrals @xmath75 are renormalized , therefore including to all orders some indirect processes going through higher - energy ( multiple ) excitations on neighbor blocks or inter - block excitations as will be shown hereafter . of course the results",
    "will be dependent on the shape and size @xmath76 of the blocks .",
    "it is possible to use the eigenstates of trimers of blocks to extract three blocks interactions . for a given shape of the elementary blocks one",

    "one should however remark that when one increases the number of blocks the identification of the eigenstates having the largest projections onto the model space may become ambiguous .",

    "of course the method is anly applicable to the study of gapped systems and to locate the phase transition between a gapped phase and a gapless phase .",
    "this limit is due to the fact that one uses different model spaces for the ground state and for the excited states .",
    "the method can not provide the low energy physics of gapless anti - ferrmagnetic lattices .",
    "for such phases the method is unable to give a strictly zero gap nor the density of states .",

    "the knowledge of the excited states of dimers or trimers of blocks enables one to define the effective interactions between an excited block and its ground state neighbors , as well as effective excitation hopping integrals , which delocalize the excitations .",
    "the effective interactions incorporate complex processes , including multiple excitations or / and inter - block excitations .",
    "these informations are used to build an excitonic hamiltonian for the infinite lattice , and to estimate the gap .",
    "the method does not provide any information on the low energy physics of gapless phases but solves some dramatic failures of the use of bare interactions ( as they manifest in the original rsrg formalism ) .",
    "it can be applied to various hamiltonians ( tight - binding , hubbard , heisenberg , ab - initio ) .",
    "the method has been presented ( and tested ) in its simplest version on spin lattices , with identical blocks , one excited state per block , and extraction from dimers and trimers .",
    "it is possible to generalize it to blocks of different sizes or topologies , and one may keep several excited states per block .",
    "the renormalized excitonic method has been tested so far to the research of singlet - triplet gaps but it is applicable as well to singlet to singlet excitations .",
    "the bottleneck is the size of the dimers or trimers of blocks , the lowest states of which have to be calculated . in the few benchmark problems tested in the present work the results are surprisingly accurate and the method seems to be able to locate phase transitions between gapped and gapless phases in 1-d and 2-d lattices at a very low computational cost .",
    "an other application concerning the shastry - sutherland,@xcite shows the relevance the here proposed method for the study of phase transition in frustrated 2-d spin lattices .",
