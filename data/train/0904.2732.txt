    "the development of novel techniques for efficient detection and spectroscopy of individual quantum emitters in the solid state is essential for an understanding of the emitter and its relationship with the surrounding environment .",
    "challenges involved with spectroscopy of such systems include tight focusing requirements and separation of the signal of interest from background scattered light due to the host crystal . in recent years",
    ", tools such as high numerical aperture objectives @xcite and near - field scanning optical microscopy tips @xcite have been used for both efficient photoluminescence ( pl ) collection and resonant optical spectroscopy .",
    "a related problem is optical spectroscopy of microphotonic resonators , where wavelength - scale focusing and effective separation of the signal from background scattered light are also necessary .",
    "the optical fiber taper waveguide is a tool that has been investigated for such experiments .",
    "these structures , sometimes referred to as silica nanofibers , are standard single mode optical fibers that have been heated and stretched down to a wavelength - scale minimum diameter . at such small dimension",
    ", the evanescent field of the waveguide mode extends into the air cladding and can be used to interrogate surrounding structures . by conducting the tapering process adiabatically and symmetrically , a double - ended device with standard single mode fiber input and output can be produced , with a typical overall transmission loss of less than 10@xmath0 .",
    "the combination of low loss , single mode guidance , and access to a wavelength - scale evanescent field has made tapered fiber probes invaluable for a wide number of microcavity - based experiments , including those in single atom and quantum dot cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "these properties also suggest that they can be effective tools for single emitter spectroscopy . indeed , theoretical work @xcite has indicated that silica nanofibers can be used to efficiently collect fluorescence from single gas phase atoms , and experimental progress to this end has been made @xcite .",
    "the above studies indicate that optical fiber taper waveguides can be a general spectroscopic tool for nanophotonic systems , providing motivation for the present work . here",
    ", we study their potential for efficient non - resonant and resonant fluorescence collection experiments on single solid state emitters embedded in a dielectric slab .",
    "additional motivation is provided in previous experimental work @xcite , where a fiber taper waveguide was used in non - resonant pl measurements of a single inas quantum dot embedded in a 256 nm thick gaas membrane on top of an al@xmath1ga@xmath2as pedestal . there , a luminescence collection efficiency of @xmath3 was estimated based on the measured saturated photon count rates , neglecting possible radiation rate modification due to the host structure , a non - resonant microdisk cavity , and any quantum dot non - idealities .",
    "important questions left unanswered include how close this efficiency was to the theoretical maximum for the particular geometry considered , and how the geometry may be modified to lead to higher efficiencies .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of studying resonant fluorescence , not addressed in   @xcite , should also be considered .",
    "as described in other recent works @xcite , resonant spectroscopy has advantages in comparison to non - resonant pl measurements in terms of greatly improved spectral resolution , potentially improved temporal resolution , the ability to avoid generation of decoherence - inducing excess carriers , well - defined state preparation , and possible utility in quantum information processing experiments .    to address these points , we consider the spontaneous emission of a dipole embedded in a semiconductor slab surrounded by air and in contact with a micron diameter silica optical fiber .",

    "the emitter may be optically pumped through an external fiber - coupled source , and radiates in both directions into the fiber , with a total coupling efficiency @xmath4 into the fundamental fiber mode ( both backward and forward directions ) .",

    "we find that fiber collection efficiencies in excess of @xmath5 may be achieved for dipole moments horizontally ( vertically ) oriented with respect to the membrane plane , exceeding what may be achieved with standard free - space optics pl collection schemes by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "these results suggest that optical fiber taper waveguides are potentially quite valuable in future studies of single solid state quantum emitters .",
    "to determine ways of further improving collection efficiency , we analyze the dependence of both the modified spontaneous emission rate and pl collection efficiency on the electromagnetic supermodes of the probing structure .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is  @xcite , which determines the modified spontaneous emission rate of a multi - level atom near a silica fiber .",
    "addition of the semiconductor slab is a non - trivial modification of this problem , requiring the use of finite - element method ( fem ) simulations to compute the guided and radiation modes of the composite slab - fiber system .",
    "these modes are used along with fdtd to determine the individual supermode contributions to the spontaneous emission fiber coupling fraction @xmath4 , under the assumption that the embedded emitter can be approximated as a two - level system .",
