    "the first comment concerns the baryon one - pion coupling constants appearing in eq . ( 18 ) .",
    "the chiral formalism employed in @xcite implies that all such constants are proportional to the factor @xmath247 associated with the pion field . in rtqm approach they are described by eq.(9 ) and are proportional to the pion - quark coupling @xmath105 which is determined by the compositeness condition discussed in sec.ii .",

    "hence the pion constant @xmath157 effectively appears as a dimensional parameter in our expressions for the baryon one - pion coupling constants .",
    "the second comment concerns the relation of the rtqm approach to the constituent quark model based on the @xmath249 symmetry for the light diquark system @xcite . exploiting this symmetry",

    "we emphasize that the @xmath249 symmetry is not realized in the rtqm approach .",
    "for instance , differing from the @xmath249 approach the light diquark current in @xmath99-baryon is not related to that in @xmath97 ( see table i ) . yet",

    "our results are quite close to the results of the nonrelativistic quark model @xcite . in @xcite",

    "a first rough estimate of the unknown coupling parameters can be obtained by setting them equal to 1 on dimensional grounds @xcite . as is evident from table v such an estimate",

    "we do not agree with the predictions on the charm and bottom p - wave decay rates of @xcite except for the @xmath259 rate where we are closer to the rate calculated in @xcite .",
    "recently the radiative decays of bottom baryons were studied with the use of the light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite in the leading order of heavy quark effective theory . for the decay rates of the @xmath260 and @xmath261 baryons to @xmath262 the authors of @xcite obtained @xmath263 where the couplings @xmath264 and @xmath265 are approximately equal to each other .",

    "we have obtained predictions for the values of couplings of charmed baryons with pions and for the rates of the one - pion transitions @xmath272 .",

    "although the @xmath277 one - photon decays have now been seen @xcite it will be close to impossible to obtain rate values for these decays because the @xmath278-states are far too narrow to be experimentally resolvable .",
