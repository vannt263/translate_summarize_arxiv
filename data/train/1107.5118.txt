    "equations that describe ideal fluid and plasma dynamics in terms of eulerian variables are hamiltonian in terms of noncanonical poisson brackets , degenerate brackets in noncanonical coordinates .",
    "because of degeneracy , such poisson brackets possess casimir elements , invariants that have been used to construct variational principles for equilibria and stability .",
    "however , early on it was recognized that typically there are not enough casimir elements to obtain all equilibria as extremal points of these variational principles . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that this casimir deficit is attributable to rank changing of the operator that defines the noncanonical poisson bracket .",
    "thus , a mathematical study of the kernel of this operator is indicated , and this is the main purpose of the present article .    recognizing a hamiltonian flow as a differential operator , the point where the rank of the poisson bracket changes is a singularity , from which singular ( or intrinsic ) solutions stem .",
    "when we consider a hamiltonian flow on a function space , the problem is an infinite - dimension generalization of the theory of singular differential equations ; the derivatives are functional derivatives , and the construction of singular casimir elements amounts to integration in an infinite - dimension space . in order to facilitate this study ,",
    "it is necessary to place the noncanonical hamiltonian formalism on a more rigorous footing , and this subsidiary purpose is addressed in the context of euler s equation of fluid mechanics , although the ideas presented are of more general applicability than this particular example .",

    "it is evident that equilibrium points of the dynamics , i.e.  points for which @xmath13 , satisfy @xmath14 however , in the noncanonical case these may not be the only equilibrium points of a given hamiltonian @xmath15 , because degeneracy gives rise to _ casimir elements _",
