    "the absorption lines in quasar spectra can place important constraints on the basic properties of quasar environments , such as the outflow velocities , column densities , mass loss rates , and elemental abundances .",
    "additionally , if quasars reside in the nuclei of massive galaxies , then we can use the chemical abundances to probe indirectly the extent and epoch of star formation in young galaxies ( schneider 1998 , hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "quasar absorption lines can be divided into three categories based on the line widths : broad absorption lines ( bals ) , narrow absorption lines ( nals ) , and intermediate mini - broad absorption lines ( mini - bals ) .",
    "the divisions between these categories are arbitrary .",
    "classic bals typically have full widths at half minimum ( fwhms ) of order 10,000 km s@xmath3 , but lines as narrow as 2000 to 3000 km s@xmath3 are often still considered bals ( weymann et al .",
    "a useful working definition of the nals is that they have fwhms smaller than the velocity separation of major absorption doublets ( e.g. , 500 km s@xmath3 for c iv @xmath61548,1551 , or 960 km s@xmath3 for n v @xmath61239,1243 ) , but often these lines are much narrower .",
    "mini - bals have widths intermediate between the nals and bals .",
    "bals appear in about 10% to 15% of optically selected quasars ( weymann et al .",
    "they appear at blueshifted velocities ( relative to the emission redshift ) ranging from near 0 km s@xmath3 to @xmath730,000 km s@xmath3 , and they clearly form in high velocity outflows from the quasar engines .",
    "mini - bals appear to be less common , although to our knowledge no one has yet done a quantitative inventory .",
    "nonetheless , mini - bals appear at the same range of blueshifted velocities as the bals and it is thought that they too form in quasar winds ( hamann et al",
    ". 1997a , jannuzi et al . 2003 ) .",
    "even though they may have complex profiles , high resolution spectra show that both bal and mini - bal profiles are `` smooth '' compared to thermal line widths , and therefore these lines are not simply blends of many nals ( barlow & junkkarinen 1994 , hamann et al .",
    "1997a , junkkarinen et al .",
    "2001 , hamann et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "nals appear at a wide range of velocity shifts .",
    "they are further classified as associated absorption lines ( aals ) if the absorption redshift , @xmath8 , is within @xmath25000 km s@xmath3 of the emission line redshift ( @xmath9 ; weymann et al .",
    "1979 , foltz et al .",
    "1986 , anderson et al .",
    "1987 , foltz et al .",
    "1988 ) . a significant fraction of aals are believed to have a physical relationship with the quasars , based on statistical correlations between the occurrence of aals and quasar properties ( see also aldcroft et al .",
    "1994 , richards et al .",
    ". however , in general , aals and other nals can form in a variety of locations , such as cosmologically intervening clouds , galaxies that are unrelated to the quasar , and clouds that are physically associated with , or perhaps ejected from , the quasar ( weymann et al . 1979 ) .",
    "nals must therefore be examined individually to determine if they are intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "several diagnostics have been proposed for this purpose , including i ) line strength variations over time , ii ) profiles that are smooth and broad compared to thermal line widths , iii ) partial line of sight coverage of the background emission source , and iv ) high densities based on excited - state absorption lines ( e.g. , barlow & sargent 1997 , barlow , hamann & sargent 1997 , hamann et al .",
    "1997a and 1997b ) .",
    "line strength variations can be caused by bulk motions across the line of sight or by changes in the ionization state of the gas .",
    "a change in the radial velocity of the absorbing material could also produce a shift in the wavelength ( redshift ) of the measured lines ( although this type of shift appears to be extremely rare , gabel et al .",
    "2003 , this paper ) . in either case ,",
    "variations over short time scales are incompatible with absorption in large intergalactic clouds .",
    "a firm lower limit on the size of intergalactic hi - absorbing clouds is approximately a few kpc ( foltz et al . 1984 , mcgill 1990 , bechtold & yee 1995 , rauch 1998 ) , which is similar to recent direct estimates of the sizes of intergalactic c  iv - absorbing clouds ( tzanavaris et al .",
    "2003 ) . assuming the clouds are uniform and",
    "do not have sharp edges , the time scale for absorption line strength variations occurring via bulk motions will be roughly the time needed for this minimum cloud to cross our line of sight . if the clouds have maximum transverse velocities of @xmath11000 km s@xmath3 ( comparable to the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in massive galaxy clusters ) , then in the @xmath130 years spanned by modern observations the cloud would travel just @xmath1@xmath10 kpc , roughly five orders of magnitude less than its diameter",
    ". variability due to changes in the ionization state is also problematic for intergalactic absorbing clouds .",
    "changes in the ionization state are nominally limited by the time scale for recombination , e.g. , if the cloud is in ionization equilibrium .",
    "recombination on time scales of @xmath1130 years requires densities of @xmath12 @xmath5 ( see  5.1 below ) , which is exceedingly high compared to the densities @xmath13 @xmath5 expected in intergalactic h i clouds ( miralda - escude et al . 1996 , rauch 1998 ) .",
    "the variation time scales might be shorter for lines forming in the ( relatively ) dense interstellar medium of intervening galaxies , but these absorption systems should be recognizable , e.g. , via damping wings in ly@xmath14 .",
    "therefore , line strength variations in nal systems that do not include damped ly@xmath14 strongly suggest that the absorption is intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "we are involved in a multi - faceted program to identify intrinsic nals and use them to place constraints on the physical properties of quasar environments . in this paper , we examine multi - epoch rest frame uv spectra of eight redshift @xmath12 quasars known to have aals and mini - bals .",
    "we find variability in 2 out of 8 aals and 2 out of 2 mini - bals .",
    "we use these results to constrain the densities and locations of the absorbing gas , and briefly discuss the implications for quasar wind models .",
    "we obtained spectra of eight quasars at the shane 3 m telescope at the university of california observatories ( uco ) lick observatory as well as at the smithsonian institution and university of arizona multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) observatory .",

    "the sbs88 spectra have a higher resolution than our lick spectra ; we therefore smoothed the sbs88 data using a boxcar routine to match the resolution of the lick spectra and facilitate comparisons .",
    "we compared the spectra from the different observations of each quasar to look for variations in the absorption line strengths . every absorption line within our wavelength coverage",
    "was examined , except those in the ly@xmath14 forest .",
    "table 2 presents the main results .",
    "two out of the eight quasars showed aal variability .",
    "two out of two mini - bals varied , and one quasar showed probable variations in a high - velocity c iv nal .",
    "notes on the variable systems are provided in  4 below .",
    "spectra showing the variations are also plotted in figures 14 .",
    "the wavelength ranges in these plots were chosen to show only the specific nals or mini - bals that varied .",
    "the peak flux in the plotted wavelength range of the reference spectrum ( solid curve ) is normalized to unity in all cases .",
    "other spectra are over - plotted and scaled to match approximately the reference spectrum in the continuum near the lines of interest .",
    "our ability to detect line variability depends on the line strength and the signal to noise ratio of the spectra .",
    "for the six aals that did not vary , we estimate upper limits on the changes , by inspection , of the strongest measured lines ( generally c iv and n v ) .",
    "in particular , we estimate that the aal equivalent widths varied by @xmath1120 % in q0207@xmath18003 , q0348@xmath16061 , pg0935@xmath16417 , and q0958@xmath16551 , and @xmath1115 % in q1159@xmath16123 .",
    "figure 1 shows four epochs of observations for q0151 + 048 .",
    "we measured clear variations in a c  iv mini - bal at @xmath19 and tentative changes in a high - velocity c  iv nal at @xmath20 .",
    "no other lines are detected at these redshifts .",
    "sbs88 report that both components of the narrow c  iv doublet at @xmath20 are blended with si  ii @xmath171526 absorption ( see fig .",
    "however , much higher resolution keck spectra ( hamann et al . 2003 ) obtained in december 1996 provide no evidence for these si  ii lines .",
    "in particular , we do not detect other low ionization lines such as feiv @xmath171608 or cii @xmath171334 .",
    "also , the redshifts and profiles of the individual c  iv doublet lines at @xmath20 match each other very well , indicating that all of the absorption is due to c  iv ( at least for the epoch december 1996 ) . the data shown in figure 1 suggest that these lines varied . in particular , the equivalent width of the short - wavelength component of the c  iv doublet is roughly twice as strong in 1981 and 1996 compared to 1997 .",
    "however , the two doublet components seem to have varied by different amounts , which is unphysical .",
    "therefore , the variability in this system is questionable .",
    "if this system is intrinsic , its displacement from the emission lines implies an outflow velocity of @xmath132,900 km s@xmath3 .",
    "sbs88 describes the c iv mini - bal in q0151@xmath16048 as a blend of four narrow c  iv absorption systems with redshifts ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "we consider this blend rather to be a mini - bal , based on its appearance in the sbs88 spectrum and on the absence of discrete narrow components in our high resolution keck spectrum ( hamann et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we measure the observed frame equivalent widths in this feature over the epochs monitored from 0.38   to 3.8  , signifying a factor of @xmath110 variation .",
    "the fwhm of the mini - bal ( as observed in oct .",
    "1981 ) is @xmath11020 km s@xmath3 , and its displacement from the emission redshift is @xmath1828,400 km s@xmath3 .",

    "the short wavelength component of the c  iv doublet is blended with an unrelated line of feii at @xmath24 .",
    "ly@xmath14 in this aal system is not clearly detected because of blending with another unrelated line .",
    "we also do not detect si  iv absorption at the aal redshift .",
    "the equivalent widths of the n  v and c  iv aals varied by 55% and 17% , respectively , between the two observations .",
    "petitjean et al . (",
    "1994 ) published high resolution ( 0.3  ) spectra of pks0424@xmath18131 obtained in 1992 .",
    "they report a total observed frame equivalent width in the n  v doublet of 1.62  , compared to 3.57   and 1.72   in our data from 1981 and 1997 , respectively .",
    "petitjean et al . (",
    "1994 ) also measured an equivalent width of 0.31 in the unblended long - wavelength component of the c iv doublet , compared to our equivalent width measurements of 3.9   and 0.36   in our 1981 and 1997 spectra .",
    "these comparisons suggest that the largest variations in these aals occurred between the 1981 sbs88 and 1992 petitjean et al .",
    "observations .",
    "higher resolution spectra ( hamann et al . 2003 ) confirm that there are several aal systems in this quasar .",
    "the two systems that sbs88 identified at @xmath25 and @xmath26 are blended together in our lick spectra",
    ". we will therefore refer to them hereafter as one system at @xmath8 = 1.9165 .",
    "there is another aal system at @xmath8 = 1.9105 that sbs88 did not identify , but that is unmistakable in our high resolution keck spectrum ( hamann et al . 2003 ) .",
    "figure 3 provides some evidence for variability in these aal systems .",
    "comparisons involving the february 1983 spectrum are ambiguous because the underlying emission lines varied substantially between that epoch and the more recent lick observations .",
    "however , the two 1997 observations suggest that similar variations occurred in the n  v and c  iv doublets . the evidence for variability is perhaps stronger for the system at @xmath8 = 1.9105 , where the equivalent width in the unblended short - wavelength component of the n  v doublet declined by approximately 50% .",
    "the aals at @xmath27 might also have varied in 1997 , but the changes coinciding with the short - wavelength doublet components in this system might be due at least in part to the variability at @xmath28 .",
    "the variability in the accompanying ly@xmath14 lines is masked by blending with ly@xmath14 forest lines .",
    "we do not detect the si  iv ( or other ) lines in these systems .",
    "figure 4 shows distinct variation in a c  iv mini - bal that is blueshifted by @xmath152,000 km s@xmath3 with respect to the emission lines ( see also hamann et al .",
    "the identification of this feature with highly blueshifted c  iv is confirmed by the appearance of n  v and o  vi absorption at the same velocity ( rodriguez hidalgo & hamann 2003 ) .",
    "this is the second highest observed velocity for a mini - bal , at nearly @xmath10.2@xmath29 , after pg2302@xmath16029 ( jannuzi et al .",
    "high - resolution keck observations of pg0935@xmath16417 ( hamann et al .",
    "1997a ) show that the mini - bal remains smooth down to a resolution of 7 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this mini - bal is therefore truly a broad line with a continuous range of absorption velocities , and not a blend of many nals .",
    "the most dramatic variation occurred between january 1993 and march 1996 ( figure 4 ) , where the observed frame equivalent width in the mini - bal increased from @xmath15.12   in 1993 to @xmath16.14   in 1996 ( @xmath119% ) .",
    "however , the change is most obvious in the shape and centroid of the mini - bal profile .",
    "the centroid of the line moved from @xmath13917   to @xmath13865 (corresponding to a shift of @xmath14000 km s@xmath3 ) between 1993 and 1996 .",
    "the fwhm of the mini - bal was @xmath11885 km s@xmath3 in 1993 and @xmath11320 km s@xmath3 on the other dates .",
    "the complex of aals in this quasar did not vary ( see also hamann et al .",
    "the line variability time scales place constraints on the physical properties of the absorbing clouds . here",
    "we assume the variations were caused by changes in the ionization state , which leads to estimates of the minimum electron density and maximum distance from the continuum source ( for a photoionized plasma ) .",
    "the results are listed in table 3 , where @xmath30 is the smallest observed variability time in the quasar rest frame , @xmath31 is the electron density , and @xmath32 is the distance from the continuum source .",
    "note that the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are limits because we measure only upper bounds on the variability times .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the gas is in ionization equilibrium and the ions we measure are the dominant ionization stages . in that case",
    ", the variability time is limited by the recombination time given by , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the rate coefficient for recombination from the observed ion stage @xmath35 to the next lower stage @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the corresponding recombination time ( see hamann et al .",
    "arnaud and rothenflugh ( 1986 ) give recombination rates for c iv @xmath38 ciii and n v @xmath38 niv as 2.8 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 s@xmath3 and 5.5 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these values , together with a nominal temperature of 20,000 k ( hamann et al . 1995 ) and the maximum recombination times set by our observations , give the minimum electron densities presented in table 3 . because of the particular values of the recombination rates , the calculated minimum electron densities for n v are consistently a factor of @xmath12 less than those for c iv .",
    "thus , we list constraints on the minimum electron densities in table 3 based only on the c iv recombination rates .",
    "we derive the maximum distance between the absorbing clouds and the continuum source by assuming the gas is in photoionization equilibrium with an ionization parameter given by , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the hydrogen density , @xmath44   is the wavelength at the lyman limit , and @xmath45 is the quasar luminosity distribution .",
    "we assume all of the quasars in our sample have the same continuum shape characterized by a segmented power law , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 from 1000   to 100,000   , @xmath180.4 from 10   to 1,000   , and @xmath181.1 from 0.1   to 10   ( zheng et al .",
    "1997 , telfer et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we also assume that the absorbing clouds are not `` shielded '' from the continuum emission source .",
    "thus the continuum spectrum incident on the absorbing clouds is diminished only by the geometric 1/@xmath48 dilution .",
    "integrating over our adopted continuum shape in equation 2 yields a convenient expression : @xmath49 where l@xmath50 is the bolometric luminosity in units of 10@xmath51 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath52 is the density in units of 10@xmath53 @xmath5 , and @xmath54 is the distance from the continuum source in parsecs .",

    "the marginal detection of variability in the high - velocity nal system of q0151 + 048 is surprising but not unprecedented .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argued that a significant fraction of nals at blueshifted velocities from 5000 to 75,000 km s@xmath3 are intrinsic to quasars , based on statistical correlations between the appearance of these lines and the quasar radio properties .",
    "the high - velocity nal system in q0151 + 048 might be one specific example at a velocity shift of @xmath132,900 km s@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , with one exception , the variable absorption lines remained fixed in velocity . the exception is the mini - bal in pg0935 + 417 whose changing centroid and fwhm was noted previously by hamann et al ( 1997a ) .",
    "however , it is not clear that these velocity changes represent real changes in the absorber kinematics",
    ". it could be that the apparent velocity changes are caused by variations in the line strength ( optical depth ) across a fixed range of absorption velocities .",
    "a more likely example of a real velocity shift involves an aal system in the seyfert i galaxy , ngc 3783 ( gabel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "all of the variable absorption lines in our sample appear at _ blueshifted _ velocities , clearly indicating outflows from the quasars",
    ". however , the wind geometry implied by these aals and mini - bals must be different from the classic bals .",
    "in particular , the line widths are small compared to the wind speed .",
    "bals typically have @xmath61/fwhm of order unity ( where @xmath61 is the outflow speed ) . in contrast , the mini - bal in q0151 + 048 has @xmath61/fwhm @xmath64 28 , and the high - velocity nal in that quasar has @xmath61/fwhm @xmath64 55 . another intrinsic absorber in q2343 + 125 ( hamann et al .",
    "1997c ) has @xmath61/fwhm @xmath64 60 .",
    "absorption lines like these with @xmath61/fwhm @xmath66 1 probably do not form in continuous outflows that accelerate from rest along our line of sight to the continuum source .",
    "if that were the case , we should see absorption at all velocities from @xmath61 to 0 , unless , perhaps , there is a peculiar ionization structure that somehow favors c iv and similar ions only at the very narrow range of observed line velocities .",
    "a more likely possibility is that the observed lines form in discrete `` blobs '' of gas that were ejected / accelerated sometime prior to the observations .",
    "however , the nature of these blobs as coherent entities is unclear .",
    "the large velocity dispersions implied by the line widths ( fwhm @xmath7 1000 km s@xmath3 for the mini - bals ) should quickly lead to a spatially extended structure .",
    "another possibility is that the flows intersect our line of sight to the continuum source ( and become observable in absorption ) only after they reach the observed high speeds ( see also hamann et al .",
    "1997c , elvis 2000 ) .",
    "thus the acceleration occurs somewhere outside of our sight line to the continuum source . in this case",
    "the flow could be continuous ",
    "simultaneously spanning a wide range of velocities and radial distances , @xmath32 , but the absorption lines sample only a limited range of these parameters , depending on the specific geometry and orientation .",
    "one plausible geometry involves a wind emanating from the quasar accretion disk ( murray et al .",
    "1995 , proga , stone & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "if the lines we measure form anywhere near the point of origin of these winds , within several parsecs of the central black hole and possibly much closer , then simple considerations based on equation 3 suggest that the actual gas densities are @xmath67 @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , the lower limits on @xmath31 in table 3 are not very constraining .",
    "they are inconsistent with only the most extreme lower densities and large radial distances ( @xmath6810 kpc ) derived for some aal systems ( based on excited - state absorption lines , e.g. , morris et al .",
    "1986 , tripp , lu & savage 1996 , hamann et al .",
    "we observed eight aal quasars to test for variability in their absorption line strengths as an indicator of intrinsic absorption .",
    "two of these quasars were also known previously to have high - velocity mini - bals . in our limited time sampling of 24 observations per quasar , we found variability in both of the mini - bals , 2 out of 8 aal systems , and possibly one additional high - velocity nal system .",
    "these results agree with previous reports of frequent variability in mini - bals ( hamann et al .",
    "1997a , jannuzi et al . 2003 ) , and with the recent finding of aal variability in 3 out of 15 quasars studied by wise et al .",
    "the short time scales over which the lines varied in our study ( sometimes @xmath690.28 years in the quasar rest frame ) implies that the absorbers are dense , compact , and physically associated with the quasars .",
