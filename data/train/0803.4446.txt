    "loop quantum cosmology @xcite  an application of methods of loop quantum gravity @xcite to symmetry reduced models  constitutes a promising way of studying quantum - gravitational effects in cosmological models . in particular one of the simplest models ,",
    "a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe was analyzed within its framework @xcite . in that case ,",
    "the structure of the hamiltonian constraint allowed to treat the constrained system as a free one , evolving with respect to the scalar field which thus plays the role of an emergent time .",
    "this , in turn , allowed the construction of a physical hilbert space and a set of dirac observables , which were used next to extract the physics by means of numerical methods .",
    "the results were quite surprising : the analysis has shown that , when the matter energy density approaches the planck scale , the quantum - geometric effects cause gravity to become repulsive . in consequence ,",
    "a large semiclassical expanding universe is preceded by a ( also large and semiclassical ) contracting one , deterministically connected to the former by a quantum bridge .",
    "the transition point of the evolution ( called quantum bounce ) is characterized by an energy density which , at this point , equals the critical value @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , even when quantum corrections actually dominate the dynamics , the state representing the universe remains semiclassical  its evolution is to great precision described by the so called classical effective dynamics @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for the flat frw model were next generalized to the spherical one @xcite ( the @xmath2 frw model ) .",
    "the properties of the hilbert space and an evolution operator were investigated analytically @xcite and the robustness of their features was confirmed through the analysis of its approximation ( known as _ slqc _ ) @xcite .",
    "further generalizations to anisotropic ( and further inhomogeneous ) models by different research groups are in various stages of progress @xcite .    thus far ,",
    "however , the only models described rigorously were universes with a vanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 and a massless scalar field .",
    "in this article , we extend the analysis of @xcite to include the universes with negative @xmath0 .",
    "although the observations favor a positive @xmath0 , this model constitutes a convenient way of testing which features of the previously investigated model we can hope to generalize to more realistic systems . also ,",
    "since it is a classically recollapsing system , we can use it to investigate semiclassicality issues ( dispersion after many cycles of evolution ) .",
    "the specific questions we intend to address here are the following :    * do the qualitative features of the @xmath1 model survive also in this case ?",
    "in particular , are the big bang / crunch singularities replaced by quantum bounces as in the previously investigated cases ?",
    "all the models analyzed so far not only experienced the bounce , but for gaussian states the observed dispersion of the wave packet after the bounce was severely restricted by the values of the spreads before it . in the flat case",
    "this result was next generalized analytically to a space of states admitting semiclassical epoch . ]",
    "@xcite within the context of slqc .",
    "therefore , it is important to ask whether such behavior will occur also in the considered model , or it was just a result of the extreme simplicity of the previous ones . *",
    "if the answer to the previous question is in the affirmative , then is the critical energy density @xmath4 still a fundamental bound ? in both the @xmath5 and @xmath2 models for physically sensible megaparsec ) scales before recollapsing . ]",
    "states , the matter energy density at the bounce point agreed to great precision with @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , later investigations within the slqc model have shown that @xmath4 is indeed a fundamental energy bound . but",
    "again , we do not know a priori whether this feature is characteristic just of the models investigated so far and how ( if at all ) it generalizes .",
    "* does this model possess any new feature not observed in @xmath1 or @xmath2 case ?",
    "a preliminary investigation of the @xmath6 model has been conducted already in @xcite .",
    "however , the physical hilbert space was not constructed ; the goal there was only to verify the persistence of the bounce .",
    "recently , a heuristically constructed effective classical hamiltonian was used @xcite to obtain the effective trajectories of both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 systems and analyze the effect of the quantum - geometric corrections on the universe s dynamics . however , since the effective hamiltonian was not derived systematically , the results have to be confirmed against genuine quantum evolution .",
    "in addition to the problems described above , we also address the concerns about the choice of the symmetric sector of the physical hilbert space that is sometimes raised . because of the absence of fermions , the triad orientation reflection is a large gauge symmetry .",
    "this allowed one to restrict the physical hilbert space to the states symmetric under parity reflection .",
    "however , since the choice of antisymmetric states is equally justified , it is natural to ask whether the results of lqc are robust and will continue to hold if the antisymmetric sector is chosen .",
    "we address this issue by analyzing , in addition to the standard symmetric states , also the space of antisymmetric ones and establish robustness .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with a brief summary of the basic framework ( introduced already in earlier papers ) in section [ sec : frame ] .",
    "its content is divided into three parts : the classical theory , the kinematics of lqc and the derivation of the quantum hamiltonian constraint . in section",
    "[ sec : wdw ] we consider a geometrodynamical equivalent of the model  the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) one .",
    "the reason for that is two - fold : first , it will allow us to compare the results of lqc against a standard quantum model and identify the nonperturbative quantum - geometric effects .",
    "second , it will serve as an introduction to the methodology of extracting physics , used next on the lqc model .",
    "the analytical solvability of the wdw model will allow us to show these methods without having to deal with the complications of numerical analysis .",
    "analysis of the physical sector is carried out in section [ sec : lqc ] .",
    "there , we extensively use the results of the numerical study described in turn in section [ sec : num ] .",
    "that section contains also a description of the construction and analysis of the states semiclassical at late times .",
    "the final results and their discussion are placed in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "apart from the main body , the article contains two appendices : in section [ sec : antisymm ] , we analyze the space of antisymmetric states , whereas [ sec : heu ] contains a description of the heuristic methods used to extract some of the results .",
    "in this section , we introduce the quantization framework used in later sections of the paper .",
    "since we directly apply the framework described in detail in @xcite , we will just present a brief sketch of it . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "the reader is referred to the above mentioned articles .",
    "the content of this section is divided into three parts . in the first , we present the classical theory used as a basis for quantization . the second part is dedicated to the description of the lqc kinematics .",
    "finally , we recall the derivation of the lqc hamiltonian constraint .",
    "a flat ( @xmath5 ) frw model represents a spacetime admitting a foliation by spatial isotropic @xmath8-surfaces @xmath9 of topology @xmath10 .",
    "its metric tensor can be written in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a time parameter ( the _ cosmic time _ ) , @xmath13 is a unit ( fiducial ) cartesian metric on the surface @xmath9 and the function @xmath14 is called a scale factor .    due to the homogeneity and noncompactness of @xmath9 , one can not write an action or hamiltonian as an integral of the appropriate density over the entire @xmath9 . instead , we can define them as integrals over a chosen fiducial cubical cell @xmath15 , constant in comoving coordinates .",
    "given such a cell , one can define a triad @xmath16 ( and cotriad @xmath17 dual to it ) as directed along the edges of @xmath15 and orthonormal with respect to @xmath13 .    as gravitational phase space variables , we choose the connections @xmath18 and the density - weighted triads @xmath19    [ eq : ae - def]@xmath20    where @xmath21 is a volume of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath13 . the real parameters @xmath22 called respectively _ connection _ and _ triad coefficients _ coordinatize the ( @xmath23-dimensional ) phase space of the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "appropriate scaling by @xmath21 ensures the invariance of the symplectic structure of this phase space ( when written in terms of @xmath22 ) under different choices of @xmath13 .",

    "is described by two global variables : the field value @xmath31 and its conjugate momentum @xmath32 , with poisson bracket between them @xmath33 the pair @xmath34 coordinatizes the phase space corresponding to the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "the full phase space of the system is thus @xmath35-dimensional .",
    "the complete hamiltonian constraint is of the form @xmath36 the above constraint defines a @xmath8d hypersurface in the @xmath35d phase space .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath37 does not depend explicitly on @xmath31 , the momentum @xmath32 is a constant of motion .",
    "therefore , the dynamical trajectories can be represented as a ( parametrized by @xmath32 ) family of functions @xmath38 @xmath39 their form implies that the considered system recollapses .",
    "each trajectory starts at the big bang singularity and ends in a big crunch .      to quantize the system , we follow the dirac program .",
    "first we construct a kinematical hilbert space : in our case , it is the tensor product of spaces corresponding to , respectively , gravitational and matter degrees of freedom : @xmath40 .",
    "for the matter we apply the standard schrdinger quantization .",

    "due to the lack of a parity violating interaction in the model considered in this article , the change in the triad orientation is a large gauge symmetry .",
    "this allowed us to restrict the physical hilbert space to the subspace of states invariant with respect to the reflection in @xmath76 corresponding to this orientation change  the symmetric sector . in principle , however , we could choose instead the space of states which are antisymmetric under considered transformation .",
    "there is no physical reason to favor one of these two choices over the other .",
    "this raised a concerns on whether the results of lqc are tied to the selection of symmetric sector and whether they will still hold in the antisymmetric one .",
    "we address these concerns here by repeating the constructions of section [ sec : lqc ] , this time building the physical hilbert space out of antisymmetric states .",
    "first , following section [ sec : lqc ] we divide the kinematical hilbert space @xmath99 onto superselection sectors , i.e.  the spaces @xmath170 of functions supported on lattices @xmath187 .",
    "the results of @xcite ( self - adjointness of @xmath95 and discreteness of its spectrum on each of these spaces ) were derived without any symmetry assumption , thus they hold also in our case .",
    "furthermore , as we will show below , the spectrum is non - degenerate also when we restrict the space of eigenfunctions to the antisymmetric ones . in consequence",
    ", we can construct the physical hilbert space as specified in , but by imposing on the relevant eigenfunctions @xmath384 the condition @xmath385 instead of the symmetry requirement .    to check the effect of the above modification on the dynamics",
    ", we have to examine how it changes the exact form of @xmath386 .",
    "that , in turn , depends on the value of the superselection sector label @xmath177 .    * for @xmath387 ( generic lattices ) , the symmetric eigenfunction on @xmath187",
    "is completely determined ( see discussion in section [ sec : num - eig ] ) by its restriction to the lattice @xmath200 , with the remaining part supported on @xmath388 determined via a symmetry relation .",
    "furthermore , symmetry does not impose any constraint on the part supported on @xmath200 itself and we can complete it to the antisymmetric eigenfunction by simply acting with @xmath389 on it . in consequence , there exists a @xmath390 correspondence between these two types of eigenfunctions .",
    "namely , each antisymmetric eigenfunction @xmath391 is related to the symmetric one @xmath189 via : @xmath392 this implies that , in the antisymmetric sector , the spectrum of @xmath95 is the same as in the symmetric one .",
    "* when @xmath393 , the situation is similar to the generic case .",
    "the solutions to on two sublattices @xmath394 and @xmath395 are independent , thus each eigenfunction is again determined by its restriction to @xmath394 . in consequence , we again have the @xmath390 correspondence between the symmetric and antisymmetric eigenfunctions @xmath396 and the spectra of @xmath95 in both sectors are identical . * the case when @xmath331 requires a bit more care . in section [ sec : num - eig ] , the symmetry assumption imposed on solutions to an additional constraint , allowing to determine @xmath397 for known @xmath398 .",
    "antisymmetry replaces this constraint by a different one : @xmath399 .",
    "therefore the whole procedure of identifying the normalizable eigenfunctions has to be redone .",
    "we can however apply exactly the same procedure as in section [ sec : num - eig ] .",
    "the results are as follows : * * the qualitative features of the eigenfunctions remain the same . in particular , we can still distinguish the same 5 zones of exponential / oscillatory behavior ( see fig.[fig : antisymm]a ) .",
    "their boundaries @xmath400 , @xmath245 are exactly the same as in the symmetric case . * * the spectrum of @xmath95 in the antisymmetric sector is different than in the symmetric case , however the eigenvalues of one sector approach the ones of the other very quickly ( see fig.[fig : antisymm]b ) . in consequence , the separation between the eigenvalues approaches , as @xmath296 , the same limit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dw]b .",
    "the rate of approach to this limit also remains the same .",
    "the similarity between eigenfunctions of the two considered sectors implies an analogous similarity between the physical states . in particular , for @xmath401 , if the eigenfunctions satisfy equations ( [ eq : sa - eg]-[eq : sa - e2 ] ) , so will the wave functions",
    ". then if we take two physical states , a symmetric and an antisymmetric one with the same spectral profile @xmath308 , the expectation values of ( all the powers of ) the observables defined in section [ sec : lqc - obs ] will be _ exactly the same _ for both of them .    for @xmath204 , due to the slight difference in the spectrum",
    ", we have to repeat the analysis of [ sec : num - state ] .",
    "but again the numerical checks reveal no measurable deviations from the results obtained in the symmetric sector .    in summary the results obtained for both @xmath401 and @xmath204",

    "the numerical tests described in the main body of the paper have shown that if a state is semiclassical at some epoch , it will remains so for a large fraction of the evolution ( i.e. , a large number of cycles of bounces and recollapses ) .",
    "in particular it remains sharply peaked even in the regions where the quantum gravity corrections modify the dynamics .",
    "this indicates the existence of a ( n effective ) classical theory whose predictions well agree with those of lqc .    at the rigorous level ,",
    "such theory was derived for @xmath1 @xcite with the use of the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite . up to the second order",
    "quantum corrections ( remaining always small during the evolution ) , its results confirm the predictions of the classical effective dynamics proposed earlier @xcite , derived heuristically by replacing the connection @xmath24 in classical hamiltonian by @xmath406 . here",
    "we apply this heuristic method to the system with a cosmological constant considered in the main body of the paper .",
    "an analogous derivation of the effective dynamics ( to the level of quadratures ) and the analysis of the resulting trajectories was done in @xcite , however the trajectory parametrization used there makes the direct comparizon with the results of quantum evolution difficult .",
    "the classical hamiltonian of the system is related to the constraint ( [ eq : classhgrav ] , [ eq : classhcompl ] ) via @xmath407 .",
    "application of the rule @xmath408 yields the result @xmath409 hamilton s equations @xmath410 and @xmath411 are identical to the @xmath1 case . written in terms of @xmath76",
    "they are respectively      taking the square of ( [ eq : ham]a ) and supplying @xmath413 via , we arrive to an analog of friedmann equation : @xmath414 where @xmath379 and @xmath4 are the total matter energy density and the critical energy density found in @xcite      applying ( [ eq : ham]b ) , we can rewrite the resulting friedmann equation in the form involving @xmath76 and @xmath31 only @xmath416^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ .\\ ] ] the sign in front of the right hand side of the above equation depends on the evolution epoch , and in particular changes during recollapse .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to rewrite in the second order form ( obtained by differentiating it ) : @xmath417 \\ .\\ ] ]    to compare the results of the numerical evolution , we integrated equation numerically using a fifth - order adaptive runge - kutta method ( known as _ rk45 _ ) .",

    "an example of the comparison results is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : vr - traj ] ,  [ fig : v - zoom ] ,  [ fig : rho - zoom ] .",
    "the trajectories agree with the results of the quantum evolution everywhere .",
    "the differences between them are much smaller than the spreads of the wave packets even near the bounce .",
    "the analysis of section [ sec : num ] has shown that the states that are semiclassical at a given initial time @xmath155 remain so for many cycles of bounces and recollapses . however , due to non - uniformity of the spectrum of the @xmath95 operator , the initially coherent wave packet slowly spreads out . here",
    "we derive an upper bound on this spread growth using some heuristic estimates and applying the knowledge about the spectrum of @xmath95 presented in section [ sec : num - eig ] .    to start with ,",
    "let us note that for large @xmath419 the distance between neighboring eigenvalues is almost constant @xmath420 ( see ) . in consequence ,",
    "the wave function is almost periodic in @xmath31 , with an approximate period equal to @xmath421 now , if we consider two classical ( effective ) trajectories corresponding to @xmath32 equal respectively to @xmath422 and @xmath423 , the difference between periods is determined by the corrections to the uniformity of @xmath282 .",
    "they are in turn bounded by the function @xmath424 ( see ) . applying this bound to ( i.e. taking @xmath425 ) and neglecting terms of higher order in @xmath426",
    ", we obtain the following difference in @xmath427 : @xmath428 which can be now used to estimate the growth of @xmath429 within one cycle . to do so",
    ", we note that , since the cosmological constant term acts like a positive @xmath430 potential , the speed @xmath431 is bounded from above by the speed @xmath432 of a classical universe with @xmath1 @xmath433 in consequence : @xmath434    in order to arrive to this bound , we used some heuristic methods that need to be confirmed using numerics . unfortunately , due to the extremely small values of @xmath435 , we were able to check only for small values of the frequency , @xmath436 .",
    "to do so , we calculated the semiclassical states in two intervals of @xmath31 separated by a large ( @xmath437 ) distance in @xmath31 and compared the difference between the maximal relative dispersion in @xmath76 observed within one cycle in both of the chosen intervals . to compute the wave functions , we used a direct summation method specified in section [ sec : num - state ] . within the checked range @xmath438 ,",
