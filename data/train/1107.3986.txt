    "interestingly , there is growing evidence that an environment characterized by high galaxy number density and low galaxy velocity dispersion , such as the one found in compact groups , plays a key role in accelerating galaxy evolution by enhancing star - formation processes in galaxies and favoring a fast transition to quiescence ( tzanavaris et al .",
    "2010 ; walker et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "such an environment could represent the immediate progenitor of a fossil system .",
    "this is straightforward if such a progenitor is a compact group , and compact groups are interpreted as transient phases in the dynamical evolution of looser groups ( barnes 1989 ) .",
    "alternatively , an environment with the previous characteristics can be produced if the existence of fossil systems is primarily driven by the relatively early infall of massive satellites ( donghia et al .",

    "( santos , mendes de oliveira & sodr 2007 ) clearly reveals the existence of many shells ( eigenthaler & zeilinger 2009 ) . according to hernquist & spergel ( 1992 ) ,",
    "many shell systems among elliptical and spheroidal galaxies may have originated through major mergers of disc galaxies with comparable masses rather than via minor mergers - between a massive elliptical galaxy and a small disc companion ( quinn 1984 ; hernquist & quinn 1988 , 1989 ) or a small elliptical / spiral companion ( dupraz & combes 1986 ) - or accretions ( thomson & wright 1990 ; thomson 1991 ) .",
    "we speculate that the relatively early infall of massive satellites can better justify the formation of a rather massive fossil group in a denser region of the lss , like cxgg095951@xmath140140.8 , whereas compact groups can more likely be the progenitors of observed low - mass and isolated fossil groups , like cxgg095951@xmath140212.6 .    on one hand",
    ", the lss surrounding the progenitor of a fossil group could be responsible more for the growth of the total mass of the system than for the growth of the stellar mass of its bcg ( see khosroshahi , ponman & jones 2006 ) .",
    "this is consistent with both the shallow dependence of the median luminosity of bcgs on the total mass of the parent halo observed in the local universe ( yang , mo & van den bosch 2008 ) and the result from the hydrodynamic simulations of cui et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that x - ray bright groups are disproportionally rare in low - density regions .",
    "on the other hand , it is reasonable to assume that isolated fossil groups can be identified as such for longer times than non isolated ones of similar mass , because it is more difficult either that their magnitude gap is replenished by infalling galaxies , or that they fall into larger bound structures . in a low density environment ,",
    "a loose group has more chances to keep its identity and dynamically evolve into a fossil group after a compact group phase ( cf .",
    "barnes 1989 ) . either in the case of early assembly",
    "( donghia et al . 2005 ; dariush et al .",
    "2007 ) or in the case of final evolution of a loose group ( barnes 1989 ) , a rapid build - up of the stellar mass and the following quick end of the star - formation activity in most of the brightest member galaxies need to be invoked . interestingly , this is what compact groups in the local universe seem to have experienced ( tzanavaris et al .",
    "2010 ; walker et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "if two channels lead to the formation of a fossil group and there is a sort of density environment bias on identification and inference on the progenitor from observations , the stellar populations of the bcg of a fossil group do not necessarily have to be remarkably different from those of field , massive early - type galaxies of similar optical and x - ray luminosities at @xmath134 ( cf .",
    "la barbera et al .",
    "furthermore , the size of environmental effects on typical red - sequence galaxies is still a controversial issue , and might be quite small at large stellar masses ( cf .",
    "e.g. , thomas et al . 2005 , 2010 ; pannella et al .",
    "2009 ; cooper et al .",
    "hence , there might be less tension between our conclusions and the result of la barbera et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "future multi - wavelength studies of statistical samples of fossil groups with different masses and redshifts ( e.g. , santos et al . 2007 ) , located in different density regions of the lss , will provide a test of our interpretation and hypotheses .      here",
    "we discuss if the contribution from low - surface brightness , diffuse stellar emission not associated with galaxies ( the so - called intracluster light - icl ) could explain the rather low value of @xmath81 found in sect .  2 for the more massive fossil group , cxgg095951@xmath140140.8 .",
    "the impact on the total stellar mass budget of the icl has already been pointed out in the literature , and with different scales , from observations ( cf .",
    "e.g. , zibetti et al . 2005 and gonzalez et al .",
    "2007 ) . in simulations ,",
    "most of the icl seems to be associated with the build - up of the bcg ( e.g. , murante et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "the expected amount of icl is uncertain as well as the observed one - 3% to 30% of all stars in groups at @xmath35 ( e.g. , kapferer et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) - and seems to be independent of the mass - scale of the galaxy system ( e.g. , dolag , murante & borgani 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "groups of galaxies that formed early ( as fossil groups , potentially ) might be particularly effective at producing icl , as interactions in the group environment begin to liberate tidal material .",
    "galaxy systems as massive as the two fossil groups under study have smaller velocity dispersions than do massive clusters , meaning that interactions on the group scales can be slow and damaging as opposite to the impulsive high speed encounters , e.g. by harrassment , on the cluster scale .",
    "these slow tidal interactions can strip material from rotating disc galaxies into loosely bound tidal structures , forming long tails of stars and gas ( donghia et al .",
    "it is then interesting to estimate this additional amount of unbound stars that can escape detection in the present data .",
    "in particular , we use the approximations developed in donghia et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to compute the fraction of icl that a disc galaxy with a dynamical mass equal to @xmath135 ( of which @xmath136 is in the disc ) produces passing on a parabolic orbit within the potential of a typical group .",
    "such a galaxy has a stellar mass of the order of @xmath137 .",
    "figure 5 shows that the smaller the pericentric distance the larger the fraction of light stripped into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the fraction of icl computed for the model galaxy is given by the ratio of the number of unbound stars to the total amount of stars bound to all the galaxies of the group .",
    "this galaxy , passing at 30 - 40 kpc from the group center , can contribute up to 3% of the total light in the group galaxies .",
    "hence , slow tidal interactions likely provide a marginal contribution to the total stellar budget of a low - mass fossil group as cxgg095951@xmath140212.6 , but a non - neglible one for a fossil group as massive as cxgg095951@xmath140140.8 . given these rough estimates",
    ", we will estimate the icl contribution to the total stellar luminosity of the two fossil groups under study in the future , thanks to the deep b- and r - band photometry recently obtained by us with the wide field imager ( baade et al .",
    "1999 ) , mounted at the cassegrain focus of the mpg / eso @xmath138 telescope in la silla , chile .",
    "for the first time , the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) was computed , down to a stellar mass @xmath139 and in a robust statistical way , for two fossil groups discovered at @xmath55 : cxgg095951@xmath140212.6 and cxgg095951@xmath140140.8 .",
    "these groups have also well - determined total masses ( @xmath2 ) equal to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this was possible because of the high - quality multi - wavelength information available for the @xmath38 area of the cosmic evolution survey ( _ cosmos _ ; scoville et al .",
    "2007 ) where the two systems were initially detected in x - rays ( finoguenov et al . in preparation ; g09 ) .",
    "in particular , the identification as fossil and the selection of the member - candidate galaxies of either group rest on robust photometric redshifts , and @xmath8 limited spectroscopy .",
    "interestingly , the large - scale structure ( lss ) in which the two fossil groups are embedded is very different : cxgg095951@xmath140212.6 appears isolated , whereas cxgg095951@xmath140140.8 belongs to a lss that covers the entire @xmath38 area of the _ cosmos _ ( corresponding to a cross size of about @xmath73 at @xmath55 ) and is traced by a total of 28 x - ray emitting groups .",
    "comparison of the gsmf of these fossil groups and the composite gsmf of the _ cosmos _ x - ray emitting groups at @xmath9 that span a similar range in total mass ( giodini et al . in preparation ) highlights a lack of star - forming galaxies with @xmath105 in the two fossil groups .",
    "consistently , the distribution of their photometric member galaxies in the @xmath12 vs @xmath5 colour  magnitude diagram reveals a well - defined red sequence and a lack of significantly bluer , luminous galaxies out to the virial radius @xmath59 of either fossil group .",
    "in addition , the total stellar mass fraction of these groups within @xmath60 is relatively large for their total masses ( g09 ) , in particular for the less massive one ( i.e. , cxgg095951@xmath140212.6 ) .",
    "this evidence suggests that the overall conversion of ( cold ) gas into stars was accelerated and/or more efficient in fossil groups with respect to the average x - ray emitting group in the same mass range and at similar redshift .",
    "the star - formation activity in member galaxies rapidly ceased afterwards .",
    "at the same time , no significant infall of galaxies with @xmath13 took place in the last 36 gyr for either fossil group at @xmath55 .",
    "if the processes shaping the galaxy component of a fossil group seem to be independent of the lss , the progenitor of an observed fossil group may depend on it . on the basis of the measured stellar mass fractions ( g09 ) and x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratios ( giodini et al . in preparation ) , we propose that compact groups are the most likely progenitors of observed low mass and isolated fossil groups , like cxgg095951@xmath140212.6 .",
    "conversely , the relatively early infall of massive satellites likely originates massive fossil groups in dense regions of the lss , like cxgg095951@xmath140140.8 .",

    "<S> we report on two fossil groups of galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 and @xmath1 discovered in the cosmic evolution survey ( _ cosmos _ ) area . selected as x - ray extended sources , they have total masses ( @xmath2 ) equal to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , as obtained from a recent x - ray luminosity  mass scaling relation . </S>",
    "<S> the lower mass system appears isolated , whereas the other sits in a well - known large - scale structure ( lss ) populated by 27 other x - ray emitting groups . </S>",
    "<S> the identification as fossil is based on the @xmath5-band photometry of all the galaxies with a photometric redshift consistent with that of the group at the @xmath6 confidence level and within a projected group - centric distance equal to @xmath7 , and @xmath8 limited spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> both fossil groups exhibit high stellar - to - total mass ratios compared to all the x - ray selected groups of similar mass at @xmath9 in the _ cosmos_. at variance with the composite galaxy stellar mass functions ( gsmfs ) of similarly massive systems , both fossil group gsmfs are dominated by passively evolving galaxies down to @xmath10 ( according to the galaxy broad - band spectral energy distributions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relative lack of star - forming galaxies with @xmath11 is confirmed by the galaxy distribution in the @xmath12 vs @xmath5 colour  magnitude diagram . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the two fossil groups appear as more mature than the coeval , similarly massive groups . </S>",
    "<S> their overall star formation activity ended rapidly after an accelerated build up of the total stellar mass ; no significant infall of galaxies with @xmath13 took place in the last 3 to 6 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity holds although the two fossil groups are embedded in two very different density environments of the lss , which suggests that their galaxy populations were shaped by processes that do not depend on the lss . </S>",
    "<S> however , their progenitors may do so . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss why the late merging of a compact group is favoured over the early assembly as a formation scenario for the isolated , low - mass fossil group .    </S>",
