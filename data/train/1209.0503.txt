    "<S> it is identical for the trajectories in opposite directions , whereas the abps due to the real magnetic field are of opposite sign for these trajectories.@xcite consequently , the trajectories with opposite circulation , acquires different effective abps , namely , the sum and difference of it due to two fields . in hall conductivity measurement , </S>",
    "<S> the terminals need to be attached to the regions with at least finite strain , though @xmath26 can be zero . in _ _ molecular graphene__@xcite , and strained graphene on ru substrate @xcite , the axial field can possibly be realized in the entire sample . </S>",
    "<S> hence the peculiar hall conductivity , we propose here , may become easily observable in those systems .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we here demonstrate the possible quantization of hall conductivity ( @xmath6 ) in strained graphene , subject to magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the strain - induced pseudo magnetic field is stronger than the real one , hall conductivity remains bounded between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , in electron and hole doped graphene respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the zeeman coupling introduces additional hall plateaus at @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> such quantization relies on sufficient backscattering among the counterpropagating edge modes , and is only true in the vicinity of the cnp , where ll crossing can safely be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the relative strength of the finite - ranged components of the coulomb interaction , various broken - symmetry phases can be realized within the zll . </S>",
    "<S> for example , on - site and next - neighbor repulsion respectively favors anti - ferromagnetic and spin hall ground states . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the conventional situation , the antiferromagnetic order , in the strain dominated regime ( @xmath29 ) , is always tied with a ferromagnetic order . for fixed @xmath26 , the many - body gaps inside the zll scale linearly with real magnetic field ( b ) and sublinearly with interaction ( @xmath146 ) , as long as @xmath29 .    </S>",
