    "first , the number of parameters , @xmath127 , is linear in @xmath39 , the dimension .",
    "second , as will be seen in section [ sec : methods ] , assuming a parametric form for the factor s distribution , one can estimate the related parameter @xmath128 by maximum pseudo - likelihood , thus learning valuable information about a variable which , by definition , is never directly observed .",
    "finally , one can control the growth rate of the dependence structure , relative to the change of the factor s value .",
    "for instance , in , a decrease in @xmath129 leads to an increase in @xmath130 , @xmath131 being the correlation parameter .",
    "if one set @xmath132 , then @xmath133 , and thus the correlation parameter , hence the conditional copula @xmath18 , does not depend on @xmath17 anymore : we call this _ conditional invariance _ , not to be mistaken with conditional independence .",

    "natural parametric one - factor copulas can be built with the help of kendall s tau and spearman s rho .",
    "recall that , given a bivariate copula @xmath141 , kendall s tau is a dependence coefficient in @xmath142 $ ] defined by @xmath143 ^ 2}c(u , v)\\,dc(u , v)-1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a value of @xmath144 hints at independence , and @xmath145 ( respectively @xmath146 ) indicates negative ( respectively positive ) dependence .",

    "the procedure works as follows .",
