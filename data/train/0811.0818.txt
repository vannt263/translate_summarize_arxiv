    "it is well - known that using the light - cone perturbation theory one can decompose the total scattering cross section of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) into a convolution of a light - cone wave function squared ( @xmath8 ) for a virtual photon to decay into a @xmath9 pair and the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude for the @xmath9 pair ",

    "we will model the nucleus by a smeared shock wave in ads@xmath1 with the following metric @xcite ( note that in this approximation there is no @xmath13-dependence , which we will henceforth suppress in the arguments of @xmath17 and @xmath2 ) @xmath25.\\ ] ] here @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the nucleus of radius @xmath28 has @xmath29 nucleons in it with @xmath30 valence gluons each .",
