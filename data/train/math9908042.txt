    "in a recent paper  @xcite , j. r. prajs remarks without proof that there are infinitely many topologically different locally connected plane continua that are homogeneous with respect to monotone open mappings .",
    "these spaces are described as _ two _ dimensional and monotone open equivalent to the sierpiski curve . here ,",
    "using the construction techniques developed in  @xcite to prove that the sierpiski curve is monotone open homogeneous , we prove that there are continuum many one dimensional locally connected plane continua that are monotone open homogeneous .",
    "a continuum , @xmath0 , is _",

    "we say two continua , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , are _",
    "monotone open equivalent _ if there is a monotone open map from @xmath0 onto @xmath4 and vice versa .",
    "this paper makes use of the fact that there is a continuous decomposition of the sierpiski curve into acyclic continua , one of which is an arc lying in the boundary of the unbounded complementary domain , such that the decomposition space is homeomorphic to the sierpiski curve .",
    "the details of the construction of such a decomposition are given in section 35 of this paper and are almost identical to the continuous decomposition described in  @xcite ; the only difference being that there in the final stage of the construction the decomposition elements are wrapped around a bounded complementary domain , while here the decomposition elements are stretched and bent in order to lie alongside an arc on the boundary of the unbounded complementary domain .",
    "this decomposition can be used to show that there is a continuous decomposition of the sierpiski curve into acyclic continua so that the decomposition space is homeomorphic to the continuum which results from taking the sierpiski curve and identifying two points on the boundary of a bounded complementary domain . combining this result with those of @xcite",
    ", we get that this last continuum is monotone open equivalent to the sierpiski curve and so is also monotone open homogeneous .",
    "a generalization of this result shows that there are continuum many locally connected plane continua that are monotone open homogeneous .",
    "this result , however , leaves open the question asked by j. prajs on whether or not there might exist a nondegenerate locally connected plane continuum that is monotone open homogeneous but is not either a simple closed curve or monotone open equivalent to the sierpiski curve .",
    "in this section we will assume the following theorem , which will be proved in the remaining sections of the paper .",
    "the proof of the theorem in sections  35 in no way depends on the results in section  2 .",
    "[ thm : construction ] there exists a continuous decomposition of the sierpiski curve into acyclic continua , one of which is an arc lying in the boundary of the unbounded complementary domain , such that the decomposition space is homeomorphic to the sierpiski curve .    we will call a bounded complementary domain of the sierpiski curve a _",

    "we remark that using the same techniques that are used in @xcite by g.  t.  whyburn to prove that two @xmath6-curves are homeomorphic , we can prove that if we have two sierpiski curves each with one pinched hole with @xmath5 lobes , then they are homeomorphic .",
    "we will also need the notion of a pinched hole with a _",
    "pinched lobe_. by a sierpiski curve with one pinched hole with @xmath5 lobes one of which is pinched we mean the continuum that results from identifying two points of the boundary of a lobe of a pinched hole where neither of the points are the center of the pinched hole .    by the standard square sierpiski curve ,",
    "we mean the sierpiski curve that results from removing open square holes from the unit square @xmath7\\times [ 0,1]$ ] in the standard way .",
    "specifically , let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the continuum that results from dividing @xmath10 into @xmath11 identical squares and removing the interior of the center one . for @xmath12 , we obtain @xmath13 by taking each of the @xmath14 squares that make up @xmath15 and dividing it into @xmath11 identical squares and then removing the interior of the center one .",
    "the standard square sierpiski curve is @xmath16 .    using theorem  [ thm : construction ] we are able to prove the following theorem :    [ thm : stob ] let @xmath17 be a sierpiski curve with one pinched hole with two lobes .",
    "then there is a continuous decomposition of the sierpiski curve into acyclic continua so that the decomposition space is homeomorphic to @xmath17",
