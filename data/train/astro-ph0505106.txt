    "the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) is easily studied with the 21-cm line absorption because the hi opacity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the column density and @xmath6 the temperature .",
    "the cnm has been an important subfield for the interstellar medium ( ism ) in general and radio astronomy in particular .",
    "theoretically the cnm is understood as being one of two thermal equilibrium states of the neutral medium @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarized the expected properties for the cnm clouds : a constant density of 42 @xmath7 , temperature of 80 k , cloud size between 0.4 and 10 pc ( with the mean value of 1.6 pc ) , the hi column density ranging between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath1 , with the mean value of @xmath10 @xmath1 .",
    "although thermal properties of the cnm are very well understood theoretically and observationally , its other aspects remain mysterious and not well - studied , primarily because of a paucity of observational knowledge .",
    "this observational paucity includes such very basics as cloud shapes ( morphology ) and the column - density distribution ; accompanying it is the theoretical paucity involving production mechanism of the cnm , the dynamic equilibrium between the cnm and its environment ( specifically , condensation , evaporation , and turbulent mixing ) , and the time scales for formation and destruction .",
    "two important recent observational works are stimulating further work on this topic .",
    "one is the millennium survey of 21-cm line absorption , of which the latest paper ( heiles & troland 2005 ; ht05 ) provides statistical distributions of the fundamental parameters : column density , temperature , turbulence , and magnetic field .",
    "the second is the detection of reliable , very weak hi absorption lines towards three high - latitude sources by @xcite and braun & kanekar ( 2005 ; bk05 ) .",
    "these latest very sensitive hi absorption observations were undertaken with the westerbork radio telescope , in the directions of four continuum sources , all located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath11 ) and relatively close to each other .",
    "the peak hi emission in these directions is very low , 25 k only . for",
    "three out of four sources multiple absorption lines were detected , with the peak optical depth of only 0.1 to 2% .",
    "bk05 discovered cold hi clouds with the lowest hi column densities ever detected for cold interstellar clouds , more than 30 times lower than what is expected for the smallest cnm clouds .",
    "fascinated by the discoveries of bk05 , and desiring to confirm their reality , we repeated their observations for two sources , 3c286 and 3c287 , with the arecibo telescope .",
    "we easily confirmed findings by bk05 for 3c286 . against 3c287",
    "we see only a weak feature with too little signal / noise to include in our discussion .",
    "in this paper we report on the arecibo observations of 3c286 and 3c287 and discuss implications of these findings .",
    "our main aim is to emphasize the existence of cold cnm clouds with the hi column densities @xmath0 @xmath1 , to discuss these data in the context of previous observational results , and to initiate discussion on the possible origin of these clouds , as well as their importance in the ism . in section 2",
    "we briefly outline our observing and data processing methods .",
    "section 3 presents basic properties of cold hi clouds in the directions of 3c286 and 3c287 .",
    "a comparison of these clouds with cnm components found in previous observational studies is given in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss several different possibilities for the formation of these clouds .",
    "the observations were conducted with the arecibo telescope .",
    "several hours of observing time were granted at the discretion of the arecibo observatory director sixto gonzalez to evaluate the viability of future very sensitive hi absorption measurements .",
    "the observing procedure was the same as in @xcite . a specific observing pattern , developed in @xcite ,",
    "was performed to estimate the ` expected ' hi emission profile .",
    "this pattern generates one on - source spectrum and 16 off - source spectra which are used to derive first and second derivatives of the hi emission on the sky .",
    "the final velocity resolution is 0.16 .",
    "the final rms noise level in the absorption spectra is @xmath12 over 0.5  channels ( or @xmath13 over 1  channels ) . after the data reduction , for both sources ,",
    "3c286 and 3c287 , we have an hi absorption ( @xmath14 ) and and an hi emission spectrum ( @xmath15 ; note that this is the emission spectrum that would be observed in the absence of the continuum source ) .",
    "we next employed the technique by @xcite to estimate the spin temperature for the cnm clouds .",
    "this technique assumes that the cnm contributes to both hi absorption and emission spectra , while the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) contributes only to the hi emission spectrum .",
    "the technique is based on the gaussian decomposition of both absorption and emission spectra , and it takes into account the fact that a certain fraction of the wnm gas may be located in front of the cnm clouds resulting in only a portion of the wnm being absorbed by the cnm .",
    "we note though that this technique may not be applicable for the case when cnm occupies a solid angle significantly smaller than that of the arecibo telescope beam ( fwhm=3.5 arcmin ) , as is most likely the case with some cnm components we find in section 4.3 . in this case",
    "the observed absorption spectrum may not correspond to the absorption that would be seen from all gas included in the emission spectrum , and hence a direct comparison of the hi absorption and emission spectra may not be a valid approach . for those very small clouds that do not fill the beam our emission intensity is underestimated , resulting in the derived spin temperature being too low .",
    "thus , we should regard our derived spin temperatures as lower limits .",
    "another issue regarding this technique is the use of gaussian functions to represent the cnm absorption profiles .",
    "@xcite discussed pros and cons of this approach in some detail .",
    "in fig .  [ f:3c286 ] we show hi emission and absorption spectra for 3c286 ( on the left side ) and 3c287 ( on the right side ) .",
    "three panels are shown for 3c286 : ( _ top : _ ) the hi emission spectrum ( a main beam efficiency of 0.9 was used to convert this spectrum from the antenna temperature units to the brightness temperature scale ) and separate contributions from the cnm and wnm to the hi brightness temperature are shown with different lines ; the final ( simultaneous ) fit to the spectrum is also overlaid .",
    "( _ middle : _ ) the hi absorption spectrum with fitted individual gaussian components .",
    "we detect three cnm components towards 3c286 .",
    "( _ bottom : _ ) the residuals of the absorption spectrum for 3c286 after the fitting process .",
    "these random - looking residuals demonstrate that the fit is perfect at the present level of signal / noise , and that the gaussian representation of cnm components is valid in this case . in the case of 3c287",
    "we have only a marginal detection at this stage .",
    "the hi absorption spectrum shows three distinct features , in good agreement with bk05 .",
    "we have fitted them with three gaussian functions centered at lsr velocities @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the spin temperature is well - constrained at the @xmath19 level for the first two gaussian components .",
    "the contribution to the hi emission profile from the last cnm component appears to be very small , resulting in its spin temperature not being well constrained ( @xmath20 level ) .",
    "the resultant hi column densities are directly proportional to these temperatures and are given in table 1 ( column 7 ) .",
    "they are all very low , @xmath21 @xmath1 .",
    "table 1 also provides upper limits to @xmath5 assuming that the linewidths are thermal , in which case the spin temperatures are equal to @xmath22 .",
    "even these are small for the first two components , a few times @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "we compare our results with bk05 , who also found three distinct absorption features at velocities and with peak optical depths very similar to ours .",
    "they fitted simultaneously hi emission and absorption spectra as resulting from spherically symmetric , isobaric clouds with an exponential hi volume density distribution . assuming a representative spin temperature of 100 k , their estimated hi column densities for absorption features is @xmath25 @xmath1 @xcite .    using our derived temperatures from table 1 , the three absorption components sum to the total estimated cnm column density @xmath26 @xmath1 , while the total wnm column density is @xmath27 @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the cnm comprises only 4% of the total hi column density in this direction .",
    "neither @xcite nor bk05 detected absorption features in this direction , indicating that the peak optical depth must be @xmath28 .",
    "we have only a marginal detection , at a 3-@xmath29 level , of an absorption feature at the lsr velocity of @xmath30  with the peak optical depth of only 10@xmath31 . as the signal / noise for this feature is too low we will place only an upper limit for the cnm in this direction .",
    "future observations will be able to clarify this detection .",
    "our upper limit on the peak optical depth ( at a 5-@xmath29 level ) is @xmath32 . if we assume a hypothetical cnm component with @xmath33 , @xmath34 k , and fwhm@xmath35 km s@xmath36 , then @xmath37 @xmath1 . as the total wnm column density in this direction",
    "is @xmath27 @xmath1 , the cnm would comprise less than @xmath38 of the total hi column density towards 3c287 .",

    "the detected peak optical depths here and in bk05 are among the lowest ever detected for galactic cnm clouds .",

    "are all @xmath64 @xmath1 , more than 30 times lower than what is traditionally expected for the smallest cnm clouds @xcite .",
    "clearly , the cnm clouds in the directions of 3c286 and 3c287 have very low hi column density , and as shown in the previous section , these cnm clouds comprise only @xmath654% of the total measured hi column density .    but how unusual are these low cnm columns ? in the most recent hi absorption survey with the arecibo telescope , @xcite found that the median hi column density for cnm clouds is @xmath66 @xmath1 ( note that the sensitivity of this survey is @xmath67 @xmath1 ) .",
    "ht05 provided statistical distributions of the fundamental parameters : hi column density , temperature , turbulence , and magnetic field .",
    "they found that the observed probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath5 , for sources primarely at high galactic latitudes , is well - approximated by @xmath68 between the limits given by :    [ nobsobsnumbers ] @xmath69    @xmath70    where the subscript 20 means units of @xmath46 @xmath1 .",
    "ht05 regarded the lower limit ( @xmath71 ) to be real , not an observational result imposed by the lack of sensitivity .",
    "however , the presence of three weak absorption components towards 3c286one of ht05 s sightlines  shows that their sensitivity estimate was optimistic .",
    "s pdf of equation [ nobsobsnumbers ] certainly applies to their sources with strong absorption lines which have received a large amount of integration time for measuring zeeman splitting .",
    "but it appears that there is a new population of cnm components that is unrepresented in their survey .",
    "mckee and ostriker ( 1977 ) predicted the cnm to form @xmath72 of the total hi .",
    "observers have traditionally found smaller column - density fractions , for example @xcite found that the majority of sightlines have the cnm column density fraction @xmath73 , while the wnm fraction is @xmath74 .",
    "this wnm column density fraction translates to a volume fraction of @xmath75 . @xcite",
    "have updated the theory of ism neutral phases and slightly refined values for the wnm pressure and density ; these refinements bring the observed wnm volume fraction to 0.8 .",
    "however , sightlines towards 3c286 and 3c287 have much smaller fractions of the cnm column density , @xmath2 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "these echo the small fractions found by ht05 , who found 19 ( out of 79 ) lines of sight with no detectable cnm ; 3c286 was one of these , so perhaps we should take their non - detections to indicate a possible representative upper limit of a few percent for this cnm / total hi ratio .    these small cnm fractions might be a problem for the theory .",
    "alternatively , the particular sightlines having small cnm fractions might lie in special regions affected by energetic processes that have temporarily destroyed the cnm .",
    "in fact , sightlines towards 3c286 and 3c287 pass through the north galactic pole region where @xcite already noticed that about 50% of hi is infalling towards the plane , while warm hi occupies about 40% .",
    "this question needs further investigation .",
    "a second population of low - column cnm clouds are those often referred to as the tiny - scale atomic structure ( tsas ) .",
    "the tsas size scale is inferred from time variability of hi absorption profiles against pulsars or vlbi imaging of extra - galactic continuum sources and ranges from a few au to a few hundreds of au .",
    "tsas typically has @xmath5 somewhat higher than our table 1 components , namely from @xmath77 to @xmath78 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found persistent variations in the hi optical depth profiles of psr b1929 + 10 which indicate structure in the cold hi with @xmath79 @xmath1 . with these column densities and small sizes",
    ", the tsas must be overpessured with respect to most of the ism .",
    "thus tsas features are thought to be very dense and over - pressured , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 reaching values up to @xmath82 @xmath7 and @xmath83 k @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that our low column density cnm clouds towards 3c286 and 3c287 are similarly overpressured , then the implied size scale is even smaller than the typical tsas scale because our column densities are somewhat smaller . alternatively , if our cnm components are at the standard ism pressure , with @xmath84 @xmath7 k @xcite , then their hi volume densities are @xmath85 @xmath7 and the implied size scales are @xmath86 au .",
    "even these larger sizes are not too much higher than the inferred sizes for much of the tsas .",
    "another indication that the low column density clouds could be related to tsas comes from direct interferometric imaging . over a range of velocities bk05 found compact emission clumps with a fwhm of 12  and an intrinsic size of 30 arcsec ; at an assumed distance of 100 pc",
    "this corresponds to a plane - on - the - sky size of about 3000 au .",
    "this morphology is distinctly different from the clumpy sheet - like model of the cnm suggested by @xcite , and may point again to a distinctly different origin of these clouds .",
    "the compact clumps at apparently random locations may be suggestive of fluctuations in the distribution of hi optical depth over a wide range of spatial scales , rather than the presence of distinct physical entities .",
    "if the low column density hi clouds and tsas features have a common origin , then tsas is significantly more abundant in the ism , and with significantly lower optical depths , than what is expected theoretically if the tsas is simply the low - size - scale extension of the interstellar turbulence spectrum as discussed by @xcite .",
    "perhaps the tsas is characterized by a range of column densities and pressures , with the classical absorption observations presented here sampling the low - density end and the pulsar / vlbi observations , which are less sensitive , the ( possibly much rarer ) high - density end .",
    "we discuss some current theoretical approaches which can lead to the production of cold clouds in the ism with column densities similar to what is found observationally . these comprise two general classes : clouds that are long - lived and can be characterized as semi - permanent structures , and transient clouds .        in the well - accepted theory of @xcite",
    "the cnm resides within warmer phases .",
    "however , it is expected that different phases are separated by an interface region through which heat flows between the two phases .",
    "the interface is a surface of transition where , for small cnm clouds , the cnm evaporates into the warmer medium and , for large cnm clouds , the warmer medium condenses onto the cnm .",
    "the classical evaporation theory @xcite predicts a critical radius for cnm clouds at which radiative losses balance the conductive heat input and at which the cloud neither evaporates nor condenses . clouds smaller than the critical radius evaporate , while clouds larger than the critical radius accrete by condensation of the surroundings .",
    "@xcite estimated the characteristic scale length for different temperature layers in the interface region .",
    "from there , in the case of the least intrusive interface , cnm to wnm with the intercloud temperature of @xmath87 k , the expected lower limit on the column density of the interface region is about @xmath88 @xmath1 .",
    "higher intercloud temperatures are more intrusive , for example for @xmath89 k the interface region would have several temperature layers with different column densities , adding up to the total column density @xmath90 @xmath1 , mainly ionized though .    in the case of the least intrusive interface with the wnm ,",
    "the cloud critical radius ( @xmath91 ) times the density of the intercloud region ( we assume @xmath92 @xmath7 ) is about @xmath93 @xmath1 ( from fig . 2 in mckee & cowie 1977 ) .",
    "the expected critical radius is then @xmath94 au , meaning that clouds smaller than this size evaporate , while cnm clouds larger than @xmath95 accrete the wnm by condensation .",
    "these small , evaporating clouds are surprisingly long - lived , typical evaporation time scale is of order of @xmath96 yr ( we have assumed the mass - loss rate of @xmath97 gr yr@xmath36 and @xmath98 @xmath7 , and used equation 47 in mckee & cowie 1977 ) .",
    "the estimated sizes for the low-@xmath99(hi ) clouds in section 4.3 are all below the critical cloud radius even in the case of the least - intrusive wnm .",
    "these cnm clouds , protected from ionization by large wnm envelopes , should be evaporating but over long time scales , and hence could be common in the ism .",
    "recent numerical simulations by @xcite show that a collision of incoming turbulent flows can initiate condensation of wnm into cold neutral clouds .",
    "this model hence naturally explains a formation of cold clouds at high galactic latitudes . in the simulations ,",
    "a collision of incoming wnm streams creates a thermally unstable region of higher density and pressure but lower temperature , which further fragments into cold structures .",
    "the thermally unstable gas has a filamentary morphology and its fragmentation into cold clouds is promoted and controlled by turbulence .",
    "typical properties of cold clouds formed in the simulations are : @xmath100 @xmath7 , @xmath101 k , @xmath102 pc . also , a lot of small clouds , with sizes reaching the numerical resolution of 0.02 pc , were found .",
    "these cold clouds are thermally stable and long - lived , in the case of stronger turbulence they are more roundish , while a weaker turbulence is responsible for more elongated morphology of cold clouds .",
    "the simulations show that the fraction of cold gas ranges from 10% in a strong turbulent case , to about 30% in a weak turbulent case .",
    "these fractions are larger than our observed fractions ; perhaps further refinement of the models can produce better agreement .",
    "in fact , it is known that the cnm fraction and the cnm column density depend also on the input mean thermal pressure and the input velocity of colliding flows which are free parameters in the simulations and could be better constrained from hi observations ( p. hennebelle , private communication ) .",
    "these simulations show that a collision of turbulent wnm streams is capable of producing a large number of small cnm clouds with low column densities , and not confined to the galactic plane .",
    "the cnm clouds are thermally stable and embedded in large , unstable wnm filaments .",
    "the abundance of cold clouds , as well as their properties , depend heavily on the properties of the underlaying turbulent flows . in a similar approach",
    ", @xcite showed that a thermally unstable shock - compressed layer can also fragment into small , cold , turbulent condensations .",
    "a cnm cloud is normally pictured as an entity in quasi - equilibrium with its surroundings .",
    "a contrasting viewpoint , stimulated by the recent flurry of numerical simulations of interstellar turbulence , envisions the clouds as dynamic entities that are constantly changing in response to the turbulent `` weather '' ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , vazquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes , & rodriguez ( 1997 ) performed simulations that produced a lot of clouds with very small sizes and low column densities ( @xmath103 @xmath1 ) .",
    "these clouds are out of equilibrium and probably very transient .    in mhd simulations by @xcite cold clouds form at the interfaces of expanding shells .",
    "their typical size is @xmath104200 pc ( see fig . 5 in vazquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes , & rodriguez 1997 ) , and for",
    "any given size the mean volume density of clouds ranges from @xmath105 to 60 @xmath7 .",
    "clouds are found to have irregular and filamentary shapes .",
    "the cloud column density ranges from @xmath106 to @xmath46 @xmath1 , while a typical fwhm is from 2 to 15 .",
    "qualitatively different is the interaction of shocks with pre - existing clouds , as opposed to clouds forming within shocks .",
    "nakamura , klein , mckee & fisher ( private communication ) find that when a supernova shock hits a pre - existing cloud , the cloud is torn up into small pieces ( ` shreds ' ) with a velocity dispersion of several .",
    "some of the predicted properties of these ` shreds ' appear close to what we observe .",
    "further advances in this area are eagerly awaited for more detailed comparison with observations .    in summary , several properties predicted by numerical simulations",
    "do not match our observations very well , others do .",
    "these theoretical efforts are in their early stages and are developing rapidly .",
    "we can expect rapid evolution in the future .",
    "recently , braun & kanekar ( 2005 ) discovered several cold hi clouds at high galactic latitudes with small hi optical depths .",
    "we have confirmed their detections in the direction of 3c286 and added an additional weak upper limit to this set .",
    "we have found the absorption components to be well - represented by gaussian functions and have derived their spin temperatures and hi column densities .",
    "these clouds have hi column densities among the lowest ever detected for the cnm features and could represent a new population of interstellar clouds .",
    "we have compared them with the tsas detected by time - variable pulsar absorption lines and vlbi and concluded that they might be of the same general class .",
    "these observational techniques used for detecting tsas might highlight the high - volume density and pressure members of this class , while the more traditional emission / absorption observations highlight the lower - volume density / pressure members .",
    "the sightlines towards 3c286 and 3c287 have very low cnm fractions .",
    "similarly low fractions have been found for 24% of continuum sources in the large hi absorption line survey by @xcite .",
    "such low cnm fractions are not theoretically predicted .",
    "this might be either a problem with the theories or might indicate that some sightlines are special , traversing regions from which cnm has been removed perhaps by energetic processes .",
    "we have investigated briefly three different theoretical approaches for the production of cold , low column density clouds in the ism .",
    "two of these envision the cnm clouds as semi - permanent entities .",
    "the third envisions the clouds as transitory structures .",
    "cnm clouds may be formed by cooling and condensation in colliding turbulent streams of wnm , whereby cold clouds are stable discrete entities surrounded by thermally unstable wnm filaments .",
    "alternatively , many numerical simulations envision cold clouds being transient and constantly changing phenomena in the turbulent ism .",
    "theory and observations are not in full accord regarding the fraction of cnm gas and its column densities .",
    "further work in both observations and theory is called for .",
    "observationally , it is essential to quantify how common these clouds are in the ism and whether they are related to some local events , such as stellar winds or large scale atomic flows .",
    "we need to increase the statistical sample to establish the probability density function of the column density in the vicinity of its current lower cutoff where most of the low-@xmath99(hi ) clouds are found .",
    "in addition we need to more firmly determine the relationship between the cnm components found here and tsas .",
    "we are grateful to telescope operators at the arecibo observatory for their help in conducting these observations , particularly to william torres and norberto despiau .",
    "we would also like to thank hector hernandez and sixto gonzalez for prompt scheduling of this project .",
