    "the bosonic hubbard model ( bhm ) has continued to attract interest since its introduction by fisher _",
    "this interest stems from the versatility of the model and its use in understanding many physical phenomena such as adsorption of bosonic atoms on surfaces@xcite , effect of disorder on superfluids and the appearance of the compressible bose glass phase  @xcite , quantum phase transitions between strongly correlated exotic phases _ etc_. in addition , in the hardcore limit , the bhm can be mapped onto heisenberg spin models and thus offers the opportunity to study these important systems under various conditions .",
    "study of the bhm intensified with the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates and the ability to load them in optical lattices  @xcite . under experimentally realizable conditions , these systems are described by the bhm and its extensions  @xcite with highly tunable parameters and in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "an increasing focus of the physics of strongly correlated quantum systems over the last several years has been the existence of unconventional phases and phase transitions .",
    "in addition to well studied mott insulating behavior caused by an on - site repulsion , or charge order driven by a near - neighbor repulsion , usurping superfluidity , more exotic scenarios are realized in which different types of order are simultaneously present , or entirely new patterns arise . an additional motivation for studying the extended one - dimensional bhm",
    "is that it provides a concrete hamiltonian in which this physics can be examined with powerful numerical methods .    in its simplest form which has only on - site contact interactions , the ground state of the bhm exhibits two phases  @xcite . at integer",
    "filling and strong repulsion , boson displacement is sterically suppressed and the system is in an incompressible mott insulating ( mi ) phase which is replaced by a superfluid ( sf ) phase at weak coupling . at incommensurate fillings ,",
    "the system is always sf . extending this model with the addition of longer range interactions or anisotropic hopping terms leads to new exotic phases .",
    "for example , extensive quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations have shown that a strong enough near neighbor repulsion can lead to insulating incompressible density wave order ( cdw ) at integer and half odd integer fillings .",
    "doping these phases can lead to phase separation or to supersolid ( ss ) phases  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of mapping the bhm onto a heisenberg model invites the question of whether the same phases of the latter are present for the former .",
    "for example , odd integer heisenberg spin systems in one - dimensional lattices can exhibit the exotic haldane phase which is a gapped phase characterized by a non - local ( string ) order parameter  @xcite .",
    "it was shown for the extended one - dimensional bhm with near and next near neighbor interactions that , at an average filling of one particle per site , the system can be mapped approximately onto the spin-@xmath5 heisenberg model and admits a haldane insulating ( hi ) phase sandwiched between mi and cdw phases  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram at unit filling for the system with only contact ( @xmath0 ) and near neighbor ( @xmath1 ) interactions was studied more extensively with conflicting results for the phase diagram . in refs .",
    "[ ] the phase diagram was shown to exhibit mi , sf and cdw phases but the hi was not found due to the very limited sizes possible to simulate at the time .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath6 phase diagram of the extended bhm , for a fixed @xmath7 ratio , was obtained using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , but showed only evidence for mi , sf and cdw .",
    "recent work  @xcite , also based on the dmrg , has shown the presence of the hi phase between the mi and cdw phases but found no evidence of ss at unit filling .",
    "even more recent work  @xcite on the same model has confirmd the hi phase .",
    "curiously , however , there seems to be no consensus on the nature of the phase in the ( @xmath8 ) plane at unit filling for small @xmath0 and large @xmath1 .",
    "references [ ] show it to be sf while ref . [ ] shows it to be cdw and reference [ ] claims it to be supersolid .",
    "we will show in this paper that it is none of the above .",
    "the above results give rise to some questions .",
    "does the hi exist for other integer fillings of the system or is it a special property of the unit filling case ?",
    "the ss phase found in one dimension @xcite was obtained by doping a cdw phase : does this phase also exist for commensurate fillings in one dimension for parameter choices similar to those in two @xcite and three dimensions @xcite ? if the ss phase exists for commensurate fillings , where is it situated in the phase diagram relative to the cdw , mi and hi phases ?",
    "theoretical studies of this system using bosonization have also led to mixed results : the hi was obtained and characterized@xcite but consensus is absent on whether the ss phase exists in this model . even though older studies did not specifically mention it  @xcite or even argued that it did not exist  @xcite",
    ", more recent studies seem to demonstrate the presence of the ss phase  @xcite , even without nearest neighbor interaction  @xcite , for both commensurate and incommensurate fillings . however , the precise nature of order and the decays of the relevant correlation functions are still far from settled .",
    "for instance , some studies predict that the single particle green function decays exponentially in the ss phase while the density - density correlation function decays as a power @xcite ; others predict that both of these correlation functions decay as powers  @xcite . finally , the universality class of the transition to the ss phase remains largely unexplored .    in this paper",
    "we extend our work in ref .",
    "[ ] using the stochastic green function ( sgf ) qmc algorithm  @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) to study the phase diagram of the one dimensional extended bhm as a function of the contact ( near neighbor ) interaction @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and the filling . for the dmrg calculations we use the code available in the alps library  @xcite .",
    "we mention that the fermionic version of this model was also studied by means of bosonization and dmrg@xcite and a hi phase established .",

    "several quantities are needed to characterize the phase diagram .",
    "it was shown recently@xcite that the well - known expression of the superfluid density as a function of the fluctuations of the winding number@xcite is valid only for hamiltonians that satisfy @xmath19 = \\frac{i\\hbar}{m } p , \\label{valeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the position and momentum operators and @xmath22 is the mass of a boson . here",

    "it is straightforward to verify that eq.([ham ] ) satisfies this condition and , therefore , the superfluid density is given by@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the winding number of the boson world lines , @xmath27 is the dimensionality and @xmath28 the inverse temperature .",
    "the cdw order parameter is the structure factor , @xmath29 , at @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the momentum distribution , @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33 the charge gap is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the ground state energy of the system with @xmath37 particles and is obtained both with qmc and dmrg .",
    "the neutral gap , @xmath38 , is obtained using dmrg by targeting the lowest excitation with the same number of bosons . in both cdw and hi phases ,",
    "the chemical potentials at both ends are set to ( opposite ) large enough values , in dmrg , such that the ground state degeneracy and the low energy edge excitations are lifted  @xcite . with the sgf we did simulations in both the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",

    "the system exhibits , in this phase , long range anti - ferromagnetic order but with no characteristic momentum . in the bhm at @xmath3 , when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are large ( with @xmath44 ) , most sites are singly occupied .",
    "quantum fluctuations allow some sites to be unoccupied or doubly occupied , but higher occupations are suppressed .",
    "one can therefore make the analogy with spin systems and define @xmath45 ( @xmath3 ) and define two nonlocal order parameters for the bhm , the string and the parity parameters : @xmath46 in practice we take the order parameters to be @xmath47 where , in qmc with pbc , @xmath48 and in dmrg , with obc , @xmath49 is the longest distance possible before edge effects start being felt . for higher",

    ", it is not enough to look at order parameters since if the system is in a phase separated state ( a mixture of two or more thermodynamic phases ) , there will be contributions from the order parameters of all the phases present . to preclude or confirm the presence of phase separation",
    ", we study the behavior of the density @xmath52 as a function of the chemical potential , @xmath2 , and also the density profile in the system .",

    "the physical quantities discussed above ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) are calculated and the various phases deduced from table [ phases ] .",

    "the string order parameter , @xmath57 , vanishes for @xmath64 ( not shown in the figure ) and takes on a finite value for @xmath65 .",
    "according to table [ phases ] , this means that for @xmath64 the system is in the mi phase ; for @xmath66 the system is in the hi phase and for @xmath67 , the system enters the cdw phase .",

    "the system is sf since @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , upon examining the other quantities such as @xmath56 ( nonzero ) and @xmath54 ( vanishes ) we conclude that the system is in the mi phase .    the behavior of the system in the region at small @xmath0 and large @xmath1 is shown in fig .",

    "this simultaneous finiteness of @xmath58 and @xmath54 seems to indicate that the system is in the supersolid phase . to confirm this , however , one must show that this is a thermodynaimcally stable phase and not a mixture of two phases . to this end",

    "[ rhovsmu ] the density , @xmath52 , as a function of the chemical potential , @xmath2 , for several values of @xmath1 and fixed @xmath84 .",
    "all these curves , which were obtained by qmc in the grand canonical ensemble , exhibit discontinuous jumps in the density at critical values of @xmath2 which depend on @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that , for these values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the system exhibits a first order phase transition .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ rhovsmu ] that for @xmath85 ( and @xmath84 ) the discontinuous jump in @xmath52 includes the value @xmath3 .",
    "this means that if the number of particles is fixed at @xmath3 , _",

    "the question then is : what are the phases into which the system separates ? to answer this , we examine the density profiles ( in the canonical ensemble ) in the system at various fillings . in fig .",
    "[ denprof ] we show the density profiles for five fillings , @xmath87 on a lattice with @xmath70 . for @xmath88 ( dashed line in fig [ denprof](a ) )",
    "the density is uniform and the system is sf . as more particles are added , for example for @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ denprof](a ) , the system becomes inhomogeneous developing two regions , one with uniform density ( and still sf ) and one with alternating site densities giving the appearance of a developing cdw phase . as more particles are added , the region with alternating site densities expands at the expense of the uniform one , fig .",
    "[ denprof](c)(d ) . when enough particles are added , the system becomes uniform displaying an oscillating local density profile indicative of a cdw phase . however , the site density alternates between @xmath90 and @xmath91 indicating that it is , in fact , a supersolid ( ss ) phase because in a true cdw phase , the local density will alternate between @xmath90 and an integer value .",
    "this is confirmed by measurement of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the observed phase separation is between the sf and ss phases .",
    "note that in the qmc simulation , the cdw region does not always appear in the same place .",
    "since these simulations are done with periodic boundary conditions , we have centered these regions to facilitate comparison .",
    "in addition , results obtained with the dmrg exhibit similar density profiles and give rise , therefore , to the same boundaries for the phase separation in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "from a mean - field point of view , the usual gutzwiller ansatz  @xcite only predicts a second order sf - ss phase transition and , therefore , no phase separation for @xmath3 . finally , since the occupation number in the density profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ denprof ] ranges from 0 to almost 2.5 , a mapping of the bosonic hubbard model to a spin chain model would require values of the total spin @xmath92 larger than 1 , which explains that this phase separation is not present in the @xmath93 chain .",
    "actually , for a fixed value of @xmath1 , one can clearly see that @xmath92 increases with decreasing values of @xmath0 : for @xmath94 , the cdw can have an arbitrary number of bosons on every other site .",
    "it is therefore tantalizing to map this situation to the classical anisotropic heisenberg model with a single ion anisotropy , which does have a first order phase transition as a function of the magnetic field ( @xmath2 for bosons ) , the spin - flop transition .",
    "however , this transition is between the neel order and the spin - flop phase , which , in the bosonic language , corresponds to a transition between the cdw and the sf phases , not between the ss and the sf ones .",
    "a proper mean - field understanding of the present transition is thus still lacking .    the resulting phase diagram at fixed @xmath3 is shown in fig .",

    "in addition , the @xmath9 phase diagram exhibits a supersolid phase not present at @xmath3 .",
    "the absence of the hi at @xmath9 is likely due to the fact that here , unlike for @xmath3 , the bosonic system can not be simply mapped on to a heisenberg spin chain system .",
    "in this section we study the phase diagram in the ( @xmath98 ) plane at fixed ratio @xmath11 . this value of @xmath7 is chosen because the cdw phase is favored over the mi phase at large @xmath0 and integer filling@xcite .",
