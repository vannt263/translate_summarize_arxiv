    "<S> we note that the emulation of electrons under the influence of a constant force has been achieved as well : the wannier - stark ladder in vibrations of aluminum rods @xcite and the observation of bloch oscillations in photonic structures @xcite seem to be the simplest realizations . among the most sophisticated </S>",
    "<S> , we may single out the propagation of bose - einstein condensates in periodic optical traps @xcite with the possibility of producing a stark ladder by means of a gravitational field .    </S>",
    "<S> in this note we study the more general case of a homogeneous force field modulated by an arbitrary time - dependent intensity , with the aim of offering another interesting possibility to the already existing configurations and emphasizing the external control of the system through such a field </S>",
    "<S> . we shall refer to it as a time - dependent stark ladder , pointing out to its generalization through the time dependence of the potential and not merely to an equispaced spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our task is therefore to find the corresponding propagator in closed form . in the case of emulations outside of the quantum regime </S>",
    "<S> , we may simply refer to our result as the green s function . </S>",
    "<S> armed with the result , we shall proceed to characterize the behaviour of caustics emerging from a point - like initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also find the explicit relation between the propagation of the corresponding wavefronts and the time - dependent modulation of the discrete potential , giving the opportunity to discuss the maximal speed of propagation of a signal and how it can be controlled within the restrictions of the lieb - robinson bound @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two recent studies in theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite grounds exemplify the relevance of these ideas .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the problem of finding the propagator for a discrete schrdinger equation in the presence of a time - dependent field . </S>",

    "<S> n(t ) = i , [ 1 ] which can be obtained from ( [ s1 ] ) through the following definitions : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> some years ago , yellin @xcite found the propagator of ( [ 1 ] ) for the case @xmath11 by means of the algebraic properties of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> for our problem , the hamiltonian operator reads    h(t ) = t + t^ + ( t ) n [ 2 ] with @xmath12 a discrete translation operator and @xmath13 the position operator with integer eigenvalues . </S>",

    "<S> [ 5 ] in order to obtain the evolution operator corresponding to ( [ 1 ] ) , the use of a dyson series seems mandatory . </S>",
    "<S> we may circumvent such a cumbersome calculation by writing down the mello - moshinsky ( mm ) equations for the _ discrete representation  _ of the evolution operator @xmath15 ( see chapter vii of @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an operator is related to the discrete propagator by the relation @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we may obtain @xmath17 by solving the mm equations through elementary techniques for recursion relations .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to mention that this procedure was used long ago by moshinsky and quesne @xcite with the purpose to show that linear canonical transformations were represented by gaussian kernels . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic oscillator with a time - dependent frequency is a good example of this , as it generates a linear canonical evolution and its propagator is given by a gaussian in the spatial variables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we employ these tools to show that the corresponding discrete version leads quite naturally to bessel functions of field - dependent arguments .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we solve the equations of motion for the operators @xmath18 and @xmath13 in the heisenberg picture :    t = -i ( t ) t , t^ = i(t ) t^ , n = i ( t - t^ ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ 6 ] using the convenient definitions    f(t ) = _ 0^t d ( ) , f(t ) = _ 0^t d , [ 7 ] we have the following linear evolution map    t(t ) = u^ t(0 ) u = e^-if t(0 ) , [ 8 ] t^(t ) = u^ t^(0 ) u = e^if t^(0 ) , [ 9 ] n(t ) = u^ n(0 ) u = n(0 ) + if t(0 ) - i f^ * t^(0 ) . </S>",

    "<S> . we note that @xmath19 are not canonically conjugate opertators , but this is not a true obstacle , as they are independent variables and we may employ them in the computation of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we might equally resort to the canonical pair    p ( t - t^ ) , x \\ { ( t+t^ ) ^-1 , n } [ 11 ] evolving under @xmath20 , but using ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 9 ] ) and [ 10 ] ) leads to mm equations which are simpler to solve . </S>",
    "<S> the sought mm equations are the following recurrence relations :    _ m , n = u_m+1,n = e^-if _ m , n = e^-if u_m , n-1 [ 12 ] _ </S>",
    "<S> m , n = u_m-1,n = e^if _ m , n = e^if u_m , n+1 [ 13 ] _ </S>",

    "<S> v_m - n , [ 15 ] where @xmath21 is so far an arbitrary function . replacing ( [ 15 ] ) in ( [ 14 ] ) yields    ( m - n ) v_m - n = if e^if/2 v_m - n+1 - if^ * e^-if/2v_m - n-1 . </S>",
    "<S> [ 16 ] finally , we obtain the familiar recursion relation of the bessel functions @xcite by defining @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we get    v _ ( ) = e^i v_+1()+ e^-i v_-1 ( ) , [ 17 ] which is solved by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a bessel function of the first kind . </S>",
    "<S> we exclude the bessel function of the second kind due to its irregular behaviour at @xmath27 , violating @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> our new propagator reads    k_m , </S>",
    "<S> n(t ) = ( t ) i^n - m ^n - m e^-i m f(t ) j_m - n(2|f(t)| ) , [ 18 ] where all the functions can be given explicitly in terms of the external field @xmath29 , as indicated in ( [ 7 ] ) . some properties of ( [ 18 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be noted immediately . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when @xmath30 , we recover     propagator for the time - independent stark ladder . </S>",
    "<S> another important limit comes from the discrete equation ( [ s1 ] ) , where one can let @xmath31 and obtain the propagator of a particle in continuous variables . for a detailed derivation , </S>",
    "<S> see the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to note that under translations , the propagator ` picks up ' a phase in the form    k_n+d , m+d(t ) & = & ( -id _ 0^t ( ) d ) k_n , m(t ) + & = & ( -i _ 0^t _ 0^d ( , ) dd ) k_n , m(t ) , [ 20 ] and reminds us of the contribution of the field @xmath32 to the classical action of a particle in continuous space . </S>",
    "<S> but the most important feature for the present work is that @xmath33 is not necessarily periodic , opening the possibility of modifying bloch oscillations by the direct control of @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> our interest now is to characterize the propagation of point - like initial conditions in this kind of scenario . </S>",
    "<S> placing the particle initially at the origin gives the probability distribution at time @xmath34 as @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well understood @xcite that even in the free case , the speed of propagation @xmath36 in a tight - binding chain has an upper bound ( in our units @xmath37 ) and that the spreading of point - like wave packets occurs at a finite velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this can be recognized also in our general problem by means of the integral representation @xcite of the bessel function :     fold - type caustic can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the ray equation obtained by the method of stationary phase is    n - m + 2|f| k_n , m = 0 . [ </S>",
    "<S> 22 ] solving for @xmath38 and replacing in the integral of ( [ 21 ] ) , gives the curves    ( n - m ) ( ) = + 2q , q  . </S>",
    "<S> [ 23 ] for the main caustic , we simply have zero phase : @xmath39 , with solutions     @xmath40 dimensional space - time and separates the propagation ( or slow ) region from the tunneling ( or fast ) region .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     now we turn to the problem of controlling the propagation by means of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we design the shape of our wavefronts in space - time by imposing @xmath33 and solving for the field . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to the inversion of ( [ 7 ] ) and it is a matter of simple algebra to show that    \\(t ) = - , [ 25 ] where @xmath41 gives directly the position as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath42 can be recovered by setting @xmath43 as a trigonometric function . </S>",
    "<S> for propagation speeds @xmath44 , we note that the second term in ( [ 25 ] ) contains a lorentz factor that becomes imaginary . </S>",
    "<S> turning @xmath29 into a complex quantity leads to non - unitary evolution and exponential decrease , in compliance with the lieb - robinson bound . in the propagation region , we always have @xmath45 . also notable </S>",
    "<S> is the presence of the acceleration of the wavefront @xmath46 in ( [ 25 ] ) , which should not be confused with the acceleration of a classical particle due to the homogenous field .    </S>",
    "<S> let us demonstrate the use of our formula with three types of ` engineered ' motion of the wavefronts : a ) uniform acceleration , b ) uniform velocity with a perfectly reflecting mirror placed at @xmath47 and c ) exponential ` freeze out ' of the wave packet expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> the condition on @xmath43 for example a ) reads @xmath48 , where the intial packet starts at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a field of the form    \\(t ) = - . [ </S>",
    "<S> 26 ] the example gives limited motion , since uniform acceleration can not be sustained forever without obtaining an imaginary lorentz factor . </S>",
    "<S> the motion demands an infinite force at times @xmath49 and a vanishing force at an intermediate time . </S>",
    "<S> see the blue curves in fig.[fig:1 ] , where the force and the motion of the wavefront are shown as functions of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting intensity pattern is shown in fig.[fig:2](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for the motion proposed in example b ) , we set @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the field intensity becomes    \\(t ) = - . [ 27 ] here it is important to note that in order to achieve a uniform @xmath51 , we can not simply turn - off the interaction , as this would strictly produce unit speed of propagation . instead </S>",
    "<S> , we have a non - trivial solution in ( [ 27 ] ) even in the absence of the mirror , producing a slow but uniform motion . at the event of reflection @xmath52 ( mirror at @xmath53 ) </S>",
    "<S> the field has a delta singularity . for a depiction , </S>",
    "<S> see the red curves in fig.[fig:1 ] and panel ( b ) of fig.[fig:2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , example c ) provides a method to stop the propagation of the pulse by applying a field . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath54 , leading to    \\(t ) = + . </S>",
    "<S> [ 28 ] the curves for @xmath29 are shown in green in fig.[fig:1 ] and the intensity pattern in fig.[fig:2](c ) . the resulting force ( [ 28 ] ) tends to a non - zero constant as @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a constant field does not produce bloch oscillations of the packet , since at the origin of time we had a very strong ( singular ) force and the wavefront depends on the history of the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> one can be convinced of this statement by inspecting the time integrals in ( [ 7 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude this note by emphasizing that exact propagators are rather uncommon objects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a collection of these kernels has been given in @xcite and a number of different paths have been devised for their calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done mainly for continuous problems , including relativistic ones @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete case should not be an exception . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xcite contains a feynman path integral version of the free discrete kernel . </S>",
    "<S> what we have presented here is a method that is common to both continuous and discrete realms and that explains the resulting solvability for a wide class of systems : the spatial representations of canonical transformations .    in a less technical order of ideas , </S>",
    "<S> let us mention that the examples presented here are of an illustrative character . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should not disregard completely their applicability to experiments designed _ ex professo ,  _ which may range from the simplicity of torsional waves in a piece of metal to the ambitious control of bose - einstein condensates in a dilute regime .    </S>",
