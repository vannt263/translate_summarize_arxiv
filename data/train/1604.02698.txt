    "the two connected components of the resulting piece with classical harmony by themselves comply , but the entire piece is not correctable because the modulation between the two keys is missing . for an example for such a piece , see figure [ rosszpelda0 ] .",
    "[ rosszpelda0 ]     knowing the fundamental theorem of tonality , we can embed the basic chord - changing compositional principles of classical harmony ( see e.g. @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.11 ) ) in our mathematical axiom system .",
    "we present a scheme how these compositional principles can be stated , according to theorem [ vcsey ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be a tonal , feasible , pauseless homophonic four - part piece and @xmath108 a chord - changing point of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 complies with classical harmony in @xmath108 , then [ _ conditions on the chord change in @xmath108 _ ] .",
    "this scheme guarantees that new chord - changing compositional principles can be added to the axiom system of classical harmony as long as the compositional principles do not contradict each other .",
    "we note that one of the chord - changing rules , the _ principle of least motion _",
    ", is very hard to formalize mathematically precisely in full generality .",
    "but there exist interesting mathematical results about this principle in the literature , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this last section , we sketch the classical compositional principles for modulations with seven chords . here",
    "we do not enumerate all exact details of the technically rather complicated compositional principles themselves , neither the _ altered chords _ , the elements of the convergence areas of the keys not detailed so far .",
    "our whole model for modulations that can be found in my bachelor s thesis at @xcite , in which all the altered chords of the keys and precise formulations of the modulational axioms takes place , is mathematically complete but still far from universal , as it only describes modulations consisting of seven chords .",
    "the seven chords of the modulation do not have to ensure that there is tonality with key @xmath91 in the starting point of the modulations , but the new key @xmath92 has to be established by a complete authentic cadence , according to the compositional principles .",
    "definition [ modka ] for modulations guarantees that in the context of modulations it is enough to consider feasible and pauseless homophonic four - part pieces .",
    "pauselessness ensures that chords that can not follow each other by actual chord - changing also will not occur directly after each other , separated by a pause . in general",
    ", pauses can weaken the impact of irregular chord progression and there are some examples in music history when composers use this .",
    "but in the case of modulations , in viennese classicism , the basic aim is to make the key change as smooth as possible and to find some connection between the beginning key and the target key , therefore such trickery is not advised .    in the following ,",
    "we establish the notions that are necessary to state the remaining compositional principles for modulations .",
    "first , we define pauseless extensions of general homophonic four - part pieces , in order to obtain a completely pauseless paradigm for the modulations that incorporates non - pauseless pieces as well . using these ,",
    "we define chord sequences , which provides a simpler interpretation for feasible pieces than the one described in section [ top ] . in the same time , note that the chorales can not be defined mathematically precisely using only chord sequences , therefore also the continuous time construction from section [ top ] is useful .",
    "let @xmath2 be a homophonic four - part piece that has no packing point apart from its endpoint , then we have a ( possibly finite ) sequence of disjoint consecutive intervals @xmath190 of which @xmath161 consists , for all of which either @xmath191 and @xmath2 has the constant value of a chord with @xmath192 and @xmath193 being either chord - changing points or boundary points of @xmath93 , or @xmath194 is a maximal general pause interval in the sense that @xmath192 and @xmath193 are boundary points of @xmath93 . in this case , there is a simple way to construct a pauseless extension @xmath195 of @xmath2 , given by an extension from @xmath93 to @xmath161 , this is called the _ right - invariant pauseless extension _ of @xmath2 : @xmath196=m(\\sup \\lbrace u \\in \\mathrm{dom}~m \\vert u < t \\rbrace ) , ~\\text{if } ~t \\in i_{i+1},i_{i+1 } \\cap \\mathrm{dom}~m=\\emptyset . \\end{cases}\\ ] ] + in this case , @xmath197 is called the _ chord sequence _ of @xmath2 , here @xmath198 s follow each other in their order in @xmath199 .",
    "we omit the proof of the following proposition , which shows the role of the playing function group @xmath200 in the topology of four - part pieces .",
    "when describing modulations , we will not make any difference between feasible homophonic four - part pieces which have the same chord sequence .",
    "the expressions ",
    "a chord sequence is tonal / is correctable / complies with classical harmony will be used in the sense that every homophonic four - part piece with the given chord sequence has this property .",
    "firstly , we have to establish a connection between modulational axioms and the definition of the correctable piece .",
    "we call modulations which satisfy not only definition [ modka ] but also the first modulational axiom ( compositional principle [ modi ] ) _ basic modulations_. for a @xmath101 modulation that complies with classical harmony apart from chord changes , the next necessary condition that we require is tonality in the starting point of the first degree triad of @xmath91 that opens the modulation , with key @xmath91 , and to also tonality in the endpoint of the first degree triad of @xmath92 that opens the modulation ( the existence of these chords is guaranteed by the first modulational axiom ) .",
    "now we can turn to the basic idea of modulations complying with classical harmony : the chord sequence of the pauseless , feasible @xmath101 modulation section has to be able to be divided into three disjoint segments ( left - closed , right - open intervals ) that cover the whole chord sequence @xcite :    neutral phase _",
    "( n ) _ : :    in this segment , which is opened by the ist degree triad , the key of    the piece is still @xmath91 ( i.e. , each element of    @xmath119 is a member of @xmath205 ) , but there are    no secondary dominant chords . in the whole modulation after the first    chord there is neither in @xmath91 nor in @xmath92    any root position ist degree triad until the tonic main triad of    @xmath92 occurs and closes the modulation . fundamental step _ ( f ) _ : :    if @xmath91 and @xmath92 are of the same type and    they are neighbours in the circle of fifths , this whole segment may be    empty . otherwise here",
    "dominant chords of different keys follow each    other .",
    "only the last can be a ( major / diminished / in the case of minor    @xmath91 and minor @xmath92 augmented ) triad , the    ones before have to be seventh chord inversions . these seventh chords    have to follow each other by _ _",
    "elision__. the    last chord of @xmath206 may be a triad and the previous chord    may resolve to it .",
    "( c ) _ : :    the modulation has to be finished by a complete authentic cadence in    the new key @xmath92 , this shows and stabilizes the tonality    in the new key .",
    "it may occur that we do not write a cadence in each    key , but a modulation progress is only finished when we reach a    cadence in some key .",
    "it is sure that the last chord before the closing    degree i triad is the degree v triad or degree v dominant seventh    chord of @xmath92 in the segment @xmath207 .",
    "the tonic    and subdominant chords of @xmath92 that preceed this chord    belong already to @xmath207 ( and not @xmath206 ) if and    only if they are built up from scale tones in @xmath92 ,    otherwise they belong to @xmath206 .",
    "if a chord sequence of a basic modulation has all the properties that we have introduced in this section , and it is the member of one of the following three modulation types , then we say that it complies with classical harmony apart from its chord - changing points .",
    "if its chord - changings are also correct , we say that the modulation complies with classical harmony .",
    "the three possible modulation types are :    diatonic : :    for the last chord @xmath208 of @xmath119 we have    @xmath209 , and every chord after this is convergent    in @xmath92 .",
    "this time @xmath206 usually consists of at    most one chord .",
    "this is the smoothest possible key change type , but it    is often not possible between keys further away from each other .",
    "enharmonic : :    the last chord of @xmath119 or the first chord of    @xmath206 is an element of @xmath91 that is enharmonic    with some element of @xmath210 .",
    "the most common enharmonic    modulation types use the enharmonic equivalence of diminished seventh    chords or augmented triads in different keys .",
    "after this chord occurs ,    we consider it as an element of @xmath210 , and make a    chord progression in @xmath92 ending with an authentic    cadence .",
    "chromatic : :    there is elision in the modulation chord sequence . very far away",
    "leading modulations , such as c major @xmath85    f@xmath63 major can be most conveniently feased this way .    in most of the cromatic modulations @xmath211    holds .",
    "these three categories do not exclude each other pairwise , while it is difficult to accomplish a modulation that is both diatonic and enharmonic at the same time . in the music score collection of the thesis",
    "we show examples of both enharmonic and chromatic and both diatonic and chromatic modulations .",
    "modulational compositional principles finish our axiomatization work . by providing more and more detailed chord - changing compositional principles based on the research of real classical music pieces and bach s chorales ,",
    "the four - part model can be refined again and again .",
    "the logical ordering of musical notions and the mathematically simpler results in this paper can now be used for writing a new classical harmony coursebook .",
    "we also plan to do experiments on the possibilities and barriers of composing four - part chorales by markov models , revising the results of @xcite .",
