    "interactions of fermions with nontrivial gauge field configurations carrying a finite winding number , @xmath4 , lead to chiral imbalance between the densities of right - handed , @xmath5 , and left - handed , @xmath6 , chiral fermions . the imbalance  induced via the adler - bell - jackiw ( abj ) anomaly  @xcite  is characterized by the finite chiral density , @xmath7 . in finite - temperature quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "the topological gauge field configurations in minkowski space are named sphalerons , whose production rate has been estimated to be quite large  @xcite . the large number of sphaleron transitions at high temperature suggests the possibility that net chirality might be abundant ( locally ) in the quark - gluon plasma phase of qcd .",
    "this observation stimulated many studies of various exotic effects , see  @xcite and references therein .    in order to describe equilibrium systems with a finite chiral density @xmath8",
    "it is customary to introduce the chiral chemical potential , @xmath9 , conjugated to the chiral density @xmath10  @xcite . because of the chiral abj anomaly as well as of chirality changing processes the chiral density @xmath10 is not a strictly conserved quantity . one might , however , assume that the chiral chemical potential @xmath11 describes a system in thermodynamical equilibrium with a fixed value of the chiral charge @xmath10 on a time scale which much larger than the typical chiral relaxation time scale @xmath2 which is needed for @xmath10 to equilibrate .",
    "for example , this equilibration has been recently studied in  @xcite where @xmath10 is generated dynamically via the chiral anomaly activated by the simultaneous presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields .    in this article",
    "we compute the chiral relaxation time , @xmath2 , in a two flavor nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model which is invoked to mimic the qcd thermal bath in the temperature range @xmath12 mev where the crossover from color confinement phase to quark - gluon plasma takes place .",
    "the main processes we consider are quark - quark scatterings mediated by collective excitations with the quantum numbers of pions , hence we simply call these processes one - pion exchange",
    ". we also consider , for completeness , scattering mediated by @xmath1-meson exchange , which however is less relevant both because of the larger @xmath1 mass and because of the smaller weight of the diagrams with @xmath13exchange compared to the ones with a pion exchange .",
    "we use the njl model to evaluate the chiral condensate at finite temperature , which allows to compute the constituent quark mass in the thermal bath .",
    "once the quark mass is known , we use the well established njl formalism to compute the scattering kernel of the microscopic processes we consider , and the collision integral ( which represents the main numerical computation of this work ) that allows to estimate the relaxation time of chirality .",
    "the main result of our article is that we find @xmath14 fm in the aforementioned crossover temperature range .",
    "we also find that the relaxation time decreases with temperature , regardless of the fact that chiral symmetry gets partially restored at the crossover .",
    "this is explained taking into account that although the scattering kernel of chirality flipping processes becomes smaller with increasing temperature , the portion of phase space for the scattering increases with temperature , eventually leading to an increase of the scattering rate and a lowering of the relaxation time .",
    "the behavior of @xmath2 versus temperature computed here is in some disagreement with the ansatz @xmath15 used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath16 corresponds to the constituent quark mass , which was admittedly too simple as it did not take into account properly the phase space opening at finite temperature .",
    "we also consider a computation in which we merge by hand the njl model below the critical temperature with a quasiparticle model above the critical temperature : the latter differs from njl because the quasiparticle thermal mass , that is obtained by a numerical fit of lattice data about pressure , entropy and energy density , is assumed to arise as a pole in the propagator dressed with a chiral invariant self - energy rather than from a term @xmath17 in the lagrangian .",
    "this thermal mass is generated by many body effects that are not present in a mean field njl : in fact the latter decribes only the constituent mass arising from both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking . in quasiparticle models the thermal mass",
    "is generally found to be large around the chiral crossover and increasing with temperature @xcite ; this large mass suppresses thermal quark excitations , therefore we expect that interpolating between njl and quasiparticles around the chiral crossover will lower the collision rate , hence increase the relaxation time .",
    "this rough idea is in agreement with our results .",
    "we however do not push very much the results of this calculation since it is far from being rigorous : our only purpose is to illustrate how the collision rate would be affected if beside the njl constituent quark mass one introduces in an effective way many body effects encoded in a large thermal mass above @xmath18 .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we state the problem and set up the main equations needed to compute the relaxation time . in section",
    "iii we discuss the one - meson exchange within the njl model . in section iv",
    "we summarize our main findings , in particular the relaxation time shown in figg .  4 and  8 .. finally in section",
    "v we draw our conclusions .",
    "the main aim of this article is to compute the relaxation time @xmath2 for chirality flips @xmath19 in a thermal bath at given temperature temperature @xmath20 . in our effective - model approach the specific microscopic process responsible for",
    "the the chirality flips is to pion - exchange between left- and right - handed quarks",
    ". we will discuss this process in details below . in this section",
    "we begin with a brief statement of the problem of chiral density relaxation , then we define the microscopic process that change chirality in the thermal bath and then we compute the relevant scattering matrix .    in order to state the problem we consider quark matter in the background of parallel electric and magnetic fields  @xcite . in this case",
    "the evolution of the chiral density @xmath10 with time is given by @xmath21 where the first term on the right hand side describes a relaxation of the chiral density due to chirality - changing processes in the thermal medium , while the second term comes from the abj chiral anomaly supplemented with the exponential prefactor which takes into account the finiteness of the quark mass @xmath22 .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 in eq .",
    "eq : gamma corresponds to the rate of the chirality flips while its inverse defines the chiral relaxation time , @xmath24    physically , eq .",
    "eq : gamma indicates that in parallel electric and magnetic external fields the abj anomaly creates a chiral imbalance @xmath10 .",
    "according to the second term of eq .",
    "eq : gamma , the chiral density should start grow linearly with time if even the chiral imbalance was initially absent in the system , @xmath25",
    ". this process would continue forever  as long as the external fields are not screened by the media  if there were no other processes in the system .",
    "however , in the thermal bath certain microscopic processes may flip the chirality of quarks and the significance of the chirality - flipping process increases with the increase of the chiral density @xmath10 .",
    "these processes are encoded in the first term in eq .",
    "eq : gamma where @xmath23 is the chirality - changing rate which defines the characteristic chiral relaxation time @xmath2 , eq .",
    "if one waits long enough , @xmath26 , the value of chiral density @xmath10 exponentially equilibrates at the following value : @xmath27 the knowledge of the relaxation time @xmath2 is therefore crucial since it allows to determine the equilibrium value of chiral density , @xmath28 , and to compute the thermodynamically conjugated chiral chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "as we describe in more details below , the microscopic processes we are interested in are quark - quark scattering mediated by collective modes with the quantum numbers of pions , hence we refer to these processes as one - pion exchange for simplicity . the computation of @xmath2 for the physical setup described above ",
    "i.e. for the system of quarks in external electromagnetic fields  is too complicated because the external fields create a finite chiral density @xmath10 which is associated with nonzero chiral chemical potential @xmath9 ; the nonzero @xmath9 and the fields affect the quark propagators , indirectly changing meson properties and scattering amplitudes , making the consistent calculation very tough . therefore , here we limit ourselves to a much simpler problem , namely to the computation of relaxation time @xmath2 for a system without external fields at negligibly small value of the chiral chemical potential @xmath29 . in this paper",
    "we are not interested in concrete physical mechanism which creates the chiral imbalance .",
    "similar approach has already been used in  @xcite to estimate @xmath2 in quark - gluon plasma , where gluon- and photon - mediated compton scattering processes have been taken as the microscopic mechanisms for chirality flips in the thermal bath . here",
    "we differ from ref .",
    "@xcite because in the region of the chiral crossover the pion - exchange processes are much more effective compared to the compton scattering .",
    "below  are about one- or even two - order to magnitude faster compared to the compton scattering . ]    by the very definition of the chiral density , @xmath30 where @xmath31 denote distribution functions for the right - handed and left - handed quarks respectively , we get @xmath32 the overall @xmath33 takes into account that @xmath10 is defined as a sum over color and flavor ; keeping this in mind , @xmath31 denote distribution functions for a quark with color and flavor fixed .",
    "time evolution of @xmath31 is given by the boltzmann collision integral , @xmath34 where @xmath35 corresponds to the standard momentum space measure , @xmath36 and the kernel @xmath37 takes into account the population of the incoming and outgoing particles in the process .",
    "eq : ps2 the squared transition amplitude @xmath38 is the main ingredient in the collision integral and it can be computed once a microscopic process has been chosen .    the microscopic processes on which we focus in this article are the transitions @xmath39 and vice - versa .",
    "the change of chiral density produced by these processes would cancel if in the thermal bath is chirally balanced , @xmath40 .",
    "however the presence of the chiral imbalance @xmath41 implies a different population of @xmath42- and @xmath43-handed quarks , which in turn results in a finite rate for the chiral density equilibration .",

    "assuming the point of view of a quasiparticle model implies that above @xmath18 quark mass can be quite large even if chiral symmetry is restored : this can affect the collision rate because of the reduction of momentum space occupied by quarks .",

    "we find that the overall effect of the quasiparticle model mass is to increase the relaxation time : as a matter of fact the increase of quark mass induces a lowering of the available phase space for the collisions , leading to a smaller collision rate and a larger relaxation time in comparison with the njl calculation .",
    "although relaxation time within the quasiparticle model is larger than the one we obtain within the njl model , the effect of increasing temperature leads to a non monotonic behavior of the relaxation rate @xmath2 : in fact the increasing of @xmath22 given by eq .",

    "these processes are good candidates for inducing chirality flips in quark matter around the chiral crossover within the effective - model approach based on the njl model .    in order to compute the chiral relaxation time , @xmath2",

    "secondly , we calculated scattering amplitudes due to meson exchanges .",
    "thirdly , we used the latter to compute the collision integral for the chirality changing processes which is directly related to the relaxation of the chiral density , @xmath231 , and we used again the njl model to relate the chiral density @xmath10 with chiral chemical potential @xmath9 in the thermal bath .",
    "we assumed a weak chiral imbalance @xmath29 in order to be able to work at the lowest order in @xmath50 what allowed us to drastically simplify the computation of the collision integral .",
    "finally , we compute the collision rate @xmath23 and the chiral relaxation time @xmath2 via the relation @xmath232 .",
    "we focused on a temperature range around the chiral crossover because at this region the quark degrees of freedom should have solid physical meaning .",
    "we found that the results for the chiral relaxation time @xmath2 do not depend on the statistics used to calculate the collision integral as , according to fig .  4 , both boltzmann and fermi - dirac distributions give very similar results in the chiral crossover region",
    "moreover , the same figure demonstrates that the chiral relaxation time @xmath233 due to the @xmath1-meson exchange is much larger compared to the relaxation time @xmath234 corresponding to the pion exchanges , @xmath235 .",
    "this feature can be explained by the fact that in the low temperature phase the @xmath1 exchange is suppressed because @xmath1-meson mass is larger than pion mass . around and above the chiral crossover the masses are of the same order , @xmath236 , but",
    "still the relaxation time related to the @xmath1-exchange is much larger compared to the one of the pion exchange due to larger number of the diagrams that contribute to the latter .",
    "thus , the pion exchanges are dominating the chiral relaxation processes .",
    "we have computed also the relaxation time in hybridized njl model . where the constituent quark s mass in the chirally restored region is tuned to the thermal mass of the quarks obtained by a fit to lattice data about qcd thermodynamics in @xcite .",
    "our results for the chiral relaxation time @xmath2 in the chiral crossover region are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig:4hjklm ] .",
    "we find that regardless of the choice of the thermal quark mass , the chiral relaxation time follows an almost monotonic behavior with increasing temperature , even if the effect of the thermal mass is to keep @xmath2 higher compared to the one computed within the njl model .",
    "globally , the relaxation time falls down with increase of the temperature from @xmath237fm at the lower - temperature end of the crossover at @xmath238mev and till much faster chiral flips , @xmath239fm at the higher - temperature at @xmath240mev .",
    "the fast increase of the collision rate ( i.e. the lowering of @xmath2 ) with rising temperature can be understood as a combination of two factors : on the one hand , the scattering matrix weighted by the distribution functions decreases with temperature , but on the other hand it also broadens in the momentum space thus effectively leading to a growing of the phase space volume involved in collisions .",
    "the latter dominates over the former , thus enhancing the collision rate and lowering the relaxation time with increase of temperature .",
