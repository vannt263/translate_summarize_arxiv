    "in the standard model(sm ) , the fermions and gauge bosons get masses through higgs mechanism with a single weak - isospin doublet higgs field . after the electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", three goldstone modes were absorbed to build up the longitudinal w and z gauge bosons , only one physical scalar called the sm higgs boson is left . although the value of the higgs mass can not be predicted in the sm , for the theoretical self - consistence , the unitarity@xcite require @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis of all the lep measurements@xcite leads to the best fitting higgs mass @xmath1 or the one - side @xmath2 cl upper limit of @xmath3 . once the higgs mass is known in the sm , the properties of the higgs boson , such as the decay width and production cross section , can be predicted .",
    "nevertheless , if there exists new physics beyond the sm , the production cross section and decay width of the higgs boson as well as the mass constraint to the higgs boson can be different .",
    "it has been shown that if the sm higgs mass lies between 130 and 200gev@xcite , the sm can in general be valid at energy scales all the way up to the planck scale .",
    "nevertheless , the sm can not be a fundamental theory , there are still some unknown puzzles in the sm , such as the origin of @xmath4 violation , the smallness of neutrino masses , the dark matter and so on .",
    "they all suggest the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "thus , many extensions or modifications of the sm have been studied . in this paper",
    ", we are going to focus on the simplest extension of the sm with adding an extra higgs double motivated from spontaneous @xmath4 violation(scpv)@xcite , such a general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with spontaneous @xmath4 violation is also called type iii 2hdm .",
    "it has been shown that if one higgs doublet is needed for the mass generation , then the additional extra higgs doublet is necessary for the origin of @xmath4 violation , so that the @xmath4 violation is originated from a single relative phase of two vacuum expectation values , which gives not only an explanation for the kobayashi - maskawa @xmath4-violating mechanism@xcite in the standard model , but also leads to a new type of @xmath4-violating source@xcite which has been studied broadly .",
    "the complex higgs doublets in the type iii 2hdm are generally expressed as  @xcite @xmath5 and the higgs potential is @xmath6 the yukawa interaction terms have the following general form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real yukawa coupling constants , so that the interactions are @xmath4 invariant .",
    "the major issue with respect to the model is that it allows flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) at the tree level through the neutral higgs boson exchanges , which should strongly be suppressed based on the experimental observations . in order to prevent the fcnc at the tree level , an _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry@xcite",
    "is often imposed : @xmath10 which leads to the so called type i and type ii 2hdm relying on whether the up- and down - type quarks are coupled to the same or different higgs doublet respectively .",
    "some interesting phenomena for various cases in such types of models without fcnc have been investigated in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "when the discrete symmetry was introduced , there will be @xmath11 and @xmath12 which implies no spontaneous cp violation any more @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the supersymmetry also requires more than one higgs doublet .",
    "the higgs sector and the relevant yukawa interactions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is analogous to the type ii 2hdm .",
    "as the fcnc is the interesting phenomena observed in experiments in the weak interactions though it is strongly suppressed , we shall abandon the discrete symmetries and consider the small off - diagonal yukawa couplings concerning the fcnc , the naturalness for such small yukawa couplings may be understood from the approximate global u(1 ) family symmetries@xcite .",
    "this may be explained as follows : if all the up - type quarks and also the down - type quarks have the same masses and no mixing , the theory has an u(3 ) family symmetry for three generation , while when all quarks have different masses but remain no mixing , the theory has the @xmath13 family symmetries and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix is a unit matrix , in this case both the direct fcnc and induced fcnc are absent . in the real world , there are some fcnc processes observed , thus the u(1 ) family symmetries should be broken down .",
    "as all the observed fcnc processes are strongly suppressed , the theory should possess approximate u(1 ) family symmetries with small off - diagnoal mixing among the generations . in this sense , the approximate u(1 ) family symmetries are enough to ensure the naturalness of the observed smallness of fcnc .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the neutral higgs bosons will get the vacuum expectation values @xmath14 where one of the phases can be rotated away due to the global u(1 ) symmetry . without losing generality , we may take @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is then convenient to make a unitary transformation @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . after making the above transformation",
    ", we can re - express the higgs doublets as follows : @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 which is the same as in the standard model .",
    "thus the higgs doublet @xmath23 in the new basis plays the role of the standard model higgs and gives masses to the gauge bosons ( @xmath24 ) and quarks and leptons . the fermi constant is then given by the same value as in the standard model @xmath25 .",
    "the higgs field @xmath26 are the goldstone particles absorbed by the gauge bosons , while @xmath27 are mass eigenstates of the charged scalar higgs , and ( @xmath28 ) are the neutral higgs bosons in the electroweak eigenstates , they are in general not the same ones ( @xmath29 ) in the mass eigenstates , but can be expressed as linear combinations of the mass eigenstates ( @xmath29 ) via an orthogonal so(3 ) transformation which depends on the @xmath30s and @xmath31s in the higgs potential . in the new basis after the unitary transformation , the phase @xmath32 appears in the yukawa coupling terms @xmath33 where @xmath34 as the yukawa coupling terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 become complex due to the vacuum phase @xmath32 , the resulting mass matrices are also complex .",
    "it then requires a unitary transformation to diagonalize the mass matrices for transforming the quark and lepton fields from the weak interaction states to the mass eigenstates . in the mass eigenstates ,",
    "the yukawa interaction terms are given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 it can be seen that the scalar @xmath40 plays the role of the higgs in the sm except considering the large mixing effects among @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which will be discussed later on . here",
    "we shall use @xmath43 and the masses of quarks as the independent input parameters instead of the original yukawa couplings in eq.([eq : oyukawa ] ) and the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "note that the type ii 2hdm can be regarded as a special case of the type iii 2hdm with spontaneous @xmath4 violation by setting @xmath45 and @xmath46 which are ensured by a discrete symmetry , @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 being the mass matrices .",
    "thus in the type ii 2hdm , the yukawa couplings are almost fixed by the masses of quarks and cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements , the angle @xmath44 or the ratio of two vacuum expectation values is manifestly an important parameter as it uniquely characterizes the amplitude of yukawa couplings for the up - type quarks @xmath50 and down - type quarks @xmath51 in the mass eigenstates .",
    "the similar situation occurs for the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) .",
    "when parameterizing the yukawa couplings by using the quark mass scales , @xmath52 where the smallness off - diagonal elements is characterized by the hierarchical mass scales of quarks and the parameters @xmath53 . in terms of this parametrization , one has the following simple relations in the type ii 2hdm @xmath54 the situation is obviously different from the general type iii 2hdm with spontaneous @xmath4 violation , where each higgs doublet couples to both up - type and down - type quarks , there are physically meaningful yukawa coupling constants which are twice as the ones in the type ii 2hdm , thus the dependence on parameter @xmath44 is not manifest as in the type ii 2hdm .",
    "there are more free parameters in the yukawa interactions , they are in general determined only through various experiments like in the standard model . whereas it provides , from the phenomenological points of view , an interesting window for exploring possible new physics effects inspired from the type iii 2hdm with spontaneous @xmath4 violation .",
    "it is seen that an additionally imposed discrete symmetry is much stronger than the @xmath4 symmetry in the 2hdm .",
    "it would be interesting to have a detailed study for both the type ii ( or type i ) 2hdm and type iii 2hdm , as the type ii or type i model was motivated from the assumption of natural flavor conservation , while type iii model was initiated from the origin of @xmath4 violation with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it was observed in the type iii 2hdm @xcite that the charged higgs interactions involving the yukawa couplings @xmath55 in eq.([eq : lagrangian ] ) lead to a new type of @xmath4-violating fcnc even if the neutral current couplings @xmath43 are diagonal . for the parameters concerning the third generation",
    ", we may express as @xmath56-quark and @xmath57-quark @xmath58 , @xmath59 meson decays@xcite even when the neutral higgs masses are taken to be the typical low values @xmath60    for the charged higgs mass , when @xmath61(or @xmath62 ) , the lower bound for the charged higgs mass can reach to be about @xmath63 gev from the @xmath64 mixing at the @xmath65 level ( or about @xmath66gev at @xmath67 level ) .",
    "in general , a smaller value of @xmath68 leads to a lower bound on the charged higgs mass .",
    "the strong constraints may arise from the radiative bottom quark decay @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , its mass was found to be severely constrained from the @xmath69 decay in the type ii 2hdm , the lower bound on the charged higgs mass can be as large as @xmath70 gev , which is corresponding to the special case in the type iii 2hdm with the parameter @xmath71(or @xmath72 ) and a relative phase @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , the constraints can significantly be relaxed in the type iii 2hdm due to the freedom of the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 as well as their relative phase @xmath76 . in general ,",
    "when the combined parameter @xmath77 becomes smaller , the resulting bound to the charged higgs mass goes to be lower .",
    "while an interesting feature arises in the type iii 2hdm , when the relative phase makes the charged higgs amplitude to interfere destructively with the standard model amplitude , the allowed charged higgs mass can remain small even for a large value of combined parameter @xmath77 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath78(or @xmath79 ) , the allowed charged higgs mass can be in all range for a large range of the relative phase ( @xmath80)@xcite , even when taking the combined parameter to be large @xmath81(or @xmath82 ) , the resulting bound on the charge higgs mass can still be as low as @xmath83 gev for a certain range of the relative phase . some strong constraints to the charged higgs mass may arise from the neutron electric dipole momentum , but we shall not consider such possible constraints as it involves large uncertainties caused by the hadronic matrix elements and also receives various contributions from several cp - violating sources in the type iii 2hdm@xcite .",
    "some upper limit on the charged higgs mass may arise from the @xmath84-parameter@xcite , which needs a more precise measurement .",
    "in 2hdm , there are three neutral and one charged higgs bosons .",
    "the charged higgs is totally different to the particles in sm , and its effect to lower - energy phenomenology and direct search have been studied by many authors . as there are more neutral higgs , in paper @xcite the authors discussed the pair production of the neutral higgs @xmath85 which is sensitive to the triple couplings in the higgs potential .",
    "in our present paper , as we only study the neutral higgs production and decays , which does not involve the charged higgs boson and the triple couplings in the potential at lowest order , thus we may consider the allowed parameter space of @xmath74 and @xmath75 to be as large as possible , and take the combined parameter @xmath77 to range from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , which is covered from the above given three typical parameter spaces .",
    "where the values of @xmath88 are taken to be small so as to fit the constraints from the @xmath64 mixing . for a large value of @xmath89",
    ", it may naturally be resulted for a large value of @xmath90 , but it is not a necessary requirement in the type iii 2hdm . for any given values of @xmath91 , one can always find appropriate parameter space of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , so as to fit the bottom quark mass @xmath94 and meanwhile allow a large yukawa coupling @xmath95 and @xmath96 to yield a small yukawa coupling @xmath97 with simultaneously fitting the top quark mass .",
    "therefore , we shall take the independent parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 as the free parameters in the type iii 2hdm instead of using the parameter @xmath91 which is unique in the type ii 2hdm and mssm .    in the following sections",
    ", we shall calculate the neutral higgs productions and decays with the above three typical yukawa couplings and free neutral higgs masses ( @xmath98tev ) .",
    "we first consider the higgs production in section [ section : productions ] , and then the higgs decay in section [ section : decays ] . in section [ section : mixings ]",
    "we shall discuss the effects of the mixing between the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "our conclusion is presented in the final section .",
    "according to qcd , the quarks and gluons are the fundamental degrees of freedom to participate in strong interactions at high energy , the qcd parton model plays a pivotal role in understanding hadron collisions@xcite . due to the gluon luminosity",
    ", the gluon fusion is the main production channel of higgs bosons in proton - proton collisions throughout the entire higgs mass range both in sm and 2hdm , and the first prediction for the production cross section of the sm higgs was carried out in@xcite .",
    "the gluon - gluon couple to the higgs boson through the quark loop is shown in fig.[fig : gg2h ] .",
    "although the higher order corrections by qcd@xcite and electroweak@xcite to the process have been calculated and discussed , here we only take the lowest order for our present purpose as the parameters in 2hdm have not well been constrained and the uncertainty remains large .",
    "to lowest order , the parton cross section can be expressed as@xcite : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the yukawa coupling of @xmath101-quark .",
    "the scaling variable is defined as @xmath102 and the loop amplitude @xmath103 has the form @xmath104/\\tau^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath105 ^ 2 , &    \\tau>1 .",
    "\\label{eq : ft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] namely if the higgs mass is smaller than the threshold of the @xmath101-quark pair production , the amplitude is real , while above the threshold , the amplitude becomes complex according to the cutkosky rule .",
    "as the yukawa coupling of top - quark is much larger than the yukawa coupling of bottom quark in sm , the higgs production is mainly through the triangular loop of top quark , and the contributions from other quarks can be omitted .",
    "while for the new neutral higgs boson in 2hdm , the situation can be different due to the possible large yukawa couplings of the @xmath106-quarks such as shown in eq.([eq : case ] ) .",
    "the running strong coupling @xmath107 is known to be as follows@xcite : @xmath108 where : @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "this formula is valid at @xmath111 with @xmath112 when @xmath113 and @xmath114 when @xmath115 .",
    "the corresponding hadronic cross section @xmath116 can be obtained by convolution with the gluon - gluon luminosity @xmath117 : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the center - of - mass energy of the proton - proton collisions , and @xmath120 is the parton distribution function ( pdf , @xcite ) of the gluon from the @xmath121-th incoming proton .",
    "we have shown in fig.[fig : pph ] the production cross - section on lhc for the neutral higgs bosons with the three typical yukawa couplings mentioned in the previous section ( eq.([eq : case ] ) ) . where @xmath122 denotes the sm - like higgs in the 2hdm and h the new higgs boson in the 2hdm .",
    "from the figure one can see that when the higgs masses are light ( @xmath123 gev ) , the production cross - section for @xmath124 is larger than the one for @xmath122 .",
    "the reason is that at the lower mass the light quark contributions to the higgs @xmath124 production can not be omitted for the possible large yukawa couplings .",
    "when the higgs mass goes to be heavy , the loop contributions from top quark become dominant , as the top quark yukawa coupling of @xmath124 is smaller than the one of @xmath122 , thus the production cross section of @xmath124 is smaller than the one of @xmath122 when they are heavy .    note that as the sm higgs is similar to @xmath122 in the 2hdm when neglecting the possible mixing among neutral higgs bosons , therefore it is hard to distinguish with the sm higgs , unless the charged higgs is very light , so that @xmath122 in the 2hdm can decay to @xmath125 , while the vertex comes from the higgs potential which is strongly model - dependent . in this note , we will not consider the possible charged higgs effect to the neutral higgs decay modes .",
    "we are going to pay attention to the neutral higgs mixing effect which also make the @xmath122 in the 2hdm differ to the sm higgs .",
    "it is seen that when the masses of @xmath122 and @xmath124 are both at @xmath126 , the cross section of @xmath122 and @xmath124 are similar , but it will be shown below that they have very different decay modes",
    ".    in general , the yukawa couplings of the new neutral higgs bosons can be complex , namely one can write @xmath127 , so that the yukawa interactions of the neutral higgs bosons in eq.([yukawa ] ) can be written into two parts : @xmath128 where the second part leads to additional contributions through a kind of anomaly loop diagrams , the resulting amplitude has the following form@xcite : @xmath129 where the @xmath130 and @xmath106 are the color index and the function @xmath131 is given by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is defined as es.([eq : ft ] ) .",
    "the cross section is calculated as the function of @xmath134 with @xmath135 and @xmath136 plotted in fig.[fig : complex_top ] , and as the function of @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 plotted in fig.[fig : complex_bottom ] , where we have also considered three typical cases given in eq.([eq : case ] ) with the absolute values of the yukawa couplings .",
    "it can be seen from the figures that : for the case a , the effect of the phase in top quark yukawa coupling becomes significant when the mass of the higgs @xmath124 increases , which is very different from the case with real yukawa couplings and implies that the top quark loop contribution to the cross - section in gluon - gluon fusion is dominant for a heavy higgs @xmath124 , while for a light higgs @xmath124 , the bottom quark contribution becomes important .",
    "however , the situation becomes different for the case b and case c when the top quark yukawa coupling goes to be small , especially for the case c where the bottom quark loop contribution becomes dominant , and the phase of the top quark yukawa coupling has less effect to the cross - section .",
    "as the neutral higgs bosons can not be directly detected , they are probed only through the final states of their decays . for the sm - like higgs @xmath122 in the general 2hdm , without considering the mixings among the neutral higgs , it has the same yukawa coupling as the higgs in sm at tree level ( except the couplings with other higgs ) . as shown in fig.[fig : smdecay ] , which likes the sm higgs decay@xcite , when its mass is lower than the ww threshold , the @xmath140 pair production is a dominant decay mode . however , the process @xmath141 is also sizable as shown in fig.[fig : smdecay ] , which is known to be a golden channel for detecting the light neutral higgs due to the clean background .",
    "it can also be seen from fig.[fig : smdecay ] that if @xmath142 gev there are two dominant processes concerning the w and z bosons , where the w and z bosons can decay to quarks and leptons .",
    "they are the golden channels for searching the heavy neutral higgs @xmath122 .",
    "the situation is very different for the new neutral higgs @xmath124 .",

    "our results are shown in fig.[fig : mixing_h1zz ] , fig.[fig : mixing_h2zz ] , fig.[fig : mixing_gm1 ] and fig.[fig : mixing_gm2 ] . from the fig.[fig : mixing_h1zz ] and fig.[fig : mixing_gm1 ] , it can be seen that the mixing effects could become significant for the sm - like higgs @xmath122 , its cross section can be much suppressed when the mixing angle becomes large .",
    "we have investigated , in the general 2hdm with spontaneous @xmath4 violation , the production and decays of the sm - like higgs @xmath122 and the new neutral higgs @xmath124 .",
    "numerically , we have considered three typical sets of yukawa couplings for the higgs boson @xmath124 , which is consistent with the current experimental bounds from the flavor sector even when the higgs boson mass is as low as @xmath194 gev .",
    "it has been seen that when @xmath122 and @xmath124 are both light , i.e. , @xmath195 gev , the production cross section of @xmath124 is in general larger than the one of @xmath122 , while for @xmath196 gev , the production cross section of @xmath122 becomes larger than the one of @xmath124 . as the yukawa couplings of @xmath124 can be complex ,",
    "its production cross section can strongly rely on the @xmath4-violating phase and be affected significantly .",
    "the @xmath140 decay mode is the dominant channel for both @xmath122 and @xmath124 , while the @xmath158 and @xmath197 are both smaller than @xmath161 and @xmath198 , thus it is not difficult to distinguish them .",
    "the sm - like higgs @xmath122 can be detected via the golden channel @xmath199 , while the new neutral higgs @xmath124 has no such a channel at tree level if without considering the neutral higgs mixing , it is mainly detected via @xmath200 as it can be very different from @xmath201 due to different yukawa coupling .",
    "when the mixing between @xmath122 and @xmath124 becomes very large and their mass difference is very small , it is then not very easy to distinguish them from the production signals . it is noted that lhc does not favor 2hdm with all parameter spaces , especially in the decoupling limit with a small yukawa coupling @xmath202 and a small mixing @xmath203 between @xmath122 and @xmath124 , in this case @xmath122 looks the same as the sm higgs and it then becomes hard to detect the new higgs bosons , thus one is not able to distinguish the type iii 2hdm and sm from a direct detection . in general , the mixing between the neutral higgs bosons @xmath122 and @xmath124 is characterized by a free parameter @xmath185 which can be large , so that the production cross section and decays of the neutral higgs boson can significantly be different from the predictions from the standard model .",
    "it would be very interesting to search for the possible new higgs boson effects at lhc or at ilc .",
