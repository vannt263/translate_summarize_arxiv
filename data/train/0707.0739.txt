    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short period binary systems in which a ( typically ) late main - sequence star ( the secondary ) transfers material via roche - lobe overflow to a white dwarf primary star . for an excellent review of cvs ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "although cvs are largely observed to study the fundamental astrophysical process of accretion , it is the roche - lobe filling secondary stars themselves that are key to our understanding of the origin , evolution and behaviour of this class of interacting binary .    in particular , the magnetic field of the secondary star",
    "is thought to play a crucial role in the evolution of cvs  driving cvs to shorter orbital periods through _ magnetic braking _ ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the transition of the secondary star to a fully convective state and the supposed shutdown of magnetic activity that this transition brings is also invoked to explain the period gap  the dearth of cvs with orbital periods between @xmath11 23 hours . on more immediate timescales , magnetic activity on the secondary stars are also thought to explain variations in cv orbital periods , mean brightnesses , mean outburst durations and outburst shapes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "that the secondary star and its magnetic field should have such a large and wide - ranging impact on cv properties should come as no surprise  the secondary star essentially acts as the fuel reserve that powers these binaries . therefore , an understanding of the magnetic field properties of the secondary stars in cvs ( e.g. spot sizes , distributions and their variation with time ) is crucial if we are to understand the behaviour of these binaries .",
    "in addition , detailed studies of the rapidly rotating secondary stars in cvs can also provide tests of stellar dynamo theories under extreme conditions .",
    "for example , questions regarding the impact of tidal forces on magnetic flux tube emergence ( e.g. @xcite ) and its effect on differential rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) are particularly pertinent ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .    despite this ,",
    "until recently there had been little direct observational evidence for magnetic activity in cvs .",
    "@xcite used tio bands to infer the presence of spots on the secondary star in ss cyg and estimated a spot filling factor of 22 per cent .",
    "unfortunately , this technique does not allow the surfaces of these stars to be imaged and hence the spot distributions could not be ascertained .",
    "most recently , @xcite used roche tomography to map the starspot distribution on a cv secondary ( ae aqr ) for the first time . in @xcite",
    "we estimated that starspots covered approximately 18 per cent of the northern hemisphere of ae aqr .",
    "the roche tomogram of ae aqr also showed that starspots were found at almost all latitudes , although there was a relative paucity of starspots at a latitude of @xmath1140@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we found that , in common with doppler images of single rapidly rotating stars , ae aqr also displayed a large high - latitude spot . in this work",
    "we continue our series of papers on roche tomography ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) by mapping starspots on the long period ( 0.61-d ) dwarf nova bv cen for the first time .",
    "we also report on the serendipitous discovery of the binarity of hd220492 .",
    "simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations were carried out over 3 nights on 2004 july 810 .",
    "the spectroscopic data were acquired using the 6.5-m magellan clay telescope and the simultaneous photometry was carried out using the carnegie institution s henrietta swope 1.0-m telescope .",
    "both telescopes are situated at the las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of bv cen were carried out using the dual - beam magellan inamori kyocera echelle spectrograph ( mike  see  @xcite ) . the mit lincoln labs ccd-20 chip with 2046 @xmath12 4096 pixels was used in the blue channel , and the site st-002a chip , again with 2046 @xmath12 4096 pixels , was used in the red channel .",
    "the standard setup was used , allowing a wavelength coverage of 3330  ",
    "5070  in the blue arm and 4460   7270  in the red arm , with significant wavelength overlap between adjacent orders . with a slit width of 0.7 arcsec , a spectral resolution of around 38,100 ( @xmath117.8 km s@xmath10 ) and 31,500 ( @xmath119.5 km s@xmath10 )",
    "was obtained in the blue and red channels , respectively .",
    "the chips were binned 2@xmath122 resulting in a resolution element of @xmath11 2.3 binned pixels in the red arm and 2.6 binned pixels in the blue arm for our chosen slit .",
    "the spectra were taken using 400-s exposure times in order to minimise velocity smearing of the data due to the orbital motion of the secondary star .",
    "comparison thar arc lamp exposures were taken every @xmath1150 minutes for the purposes of wavelength calibration .    with this setup",
    "we obtained 63 usable spectra in each arm .",
    "since the main goal of the magellan run was to observe ae aqr , we were restricted to 3-hour windows each night to observe bv cen . over our allocated 4 nights",
    "this would have allowed over 80 per cent of the orbit of bv cen to be observed , but unfortunately we lost the final night due to bad weather .",
    "other than that , the seeing was typically 0.60.7 arcsec on the first night and 0.9 arcsec on the next two nights , with occasional degradation to 1.5 arcsec .",
    "the peak signal - to - noise of the blue spectra ranged from 29  56 ( typically @xmath1150 ) in the blue arm , and from 38  76 ( typically @xmath1165 ) in the red arm .",
    "table  [ table : log ] gives a journal of the observations .",
    "it should be noted that when using mike it is not possible to change the slit orientation on the sky . in order to compensate for this , and reduce atmospheric dispersion across the slit , mike is mounted at a 30@xmath0 angle to the naysmith platform .",
    "this means that at zenith distances greater than @xmath1150@xmath0 dispersion across the slit becomes significant . to avoid this , all observations of bv cen were carried out at low airmasses and no exposure of bv cen was carried out for an airmass above 1.39 ( zenith distance @xmath13 44@xmath0 ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in addition to the many starspot signatures that are visible in bv cen s trailed spectra ( see fig  [ fig : trails ] ) , a curious narrow feature is also evident between phases 0.328 and 0.366 on the blue edge of the profile .",
    "this feature appears as a narrow continuation of the main track through the profiles during this block of observations , but lies outside the stellar absorption profile and therefore can not lie on the stellar surface .",
    "closer inspection of the individual profiles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sling ] ) reveals a narrow , weak emission feature in the continuum of 5 lsd profiles . in order to confirm the reality of this feature , we have visually inspected the profiles",
    "that were deconvolved from the blue and red spectra separately to see whether they are present in both sets of profiles . indeed",
    "this feature is present ( albeit very weakly ) in both sets of profiles which makes it unlikely to be due to noise or a systematic effect arising during the lsd process .",
    "this feature is also not due to contamination from lunar or solar light during the observations as this would appear as an absorption feature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , moon - rise did not occur until at least 2 hours ( extending to 4 hours on the final night ) after observations of bv cen were concluded .",
    "the fact that the feature is at zero velocity with respect to bv cen s systemic velocity of -22 km s@xmath10 rules out a ` terrestrial ' origin , which would be centred at 0 km s@xmath10 .",
    "we are therefore confident that this feature is real .",
    "since the emission feature lies outside the stellar line profile , and hence lies off the stellar limb , it can only be attributed to circumstellar material .",
    "solar prominences appear as bright emission loops when they are viewed off the solar limb , and it is probable that we are also seeing a prominence structure on bv cen .",
    "indeed , large prominences have been reported on other rapidly rotating stars such as ab dor ( e.g. @xcite ) and speedy mic ( @xcite ) and are often observed as transient absorption features passing through the doppler broadened h@xmath14 stellar line .",
    "recently , however , analysis of vlt data of speedy mic by @xcite has revealed rotationally modulated emission outside of the stellar h@xmath14 line due to loops of emission seen off of the stellar disc , but which can also be associated with prominences seen to transit the stellar disc at other times . in addition , peculiar low - velocity emission features seen in ss cyg and ip peg during outburst have also been interpreted as ` slingshot prominences ' ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discovered the presence of highly - ionized low velocity - dispersion material located between the @xmath1 point and the centre of mass in am her which they attributed to a slingshot prominence .",
    "similarly , triple - peaked h@xmath14 lines following the motion of the donor star in am her has been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors interpreted these as long - lived prominences on the donor star and noted that one component was consistent with stellar activity lying vertically above the @xmath1 point .",
    "the emission feature we see in bv cen appears stationary at @xmath110 km s@xmath10 within the binary frame .",
    "this is in keeping with the stationary slingshot prominences seen in ss cyg and ip peg by @xcite , and the low - velocity emission observed in other cvs ( @xcite ) .",
    "generally , we would expect the emission from prominences observed off the stellar limb to be weak and undetectable for cvs given their faintness . however , it is possible that the prominences are illuminated by the accretion light , causing prominences forming between the donor star and the white dwarf to become visible when otherwise they would be undetectable .",
    "certainly , the low velocity of the emission suggests a position close to the centre - of - mass of the binary at a point between the donor star and white dwarf where such illumination is most likely .",
    "given that prominences are normally only seen in lines that form above the photosphere ( e.g. the hydrogen balmer lines ) , observing them in the lsd profiles which are obtained from photospheric lines is unexpected under normal conditions .",
    "we believe that the emission seen in bv cen s photospheric lines is due to excitation of these species within low density gas in the prominence due to the impact of irradiation .",
    "thus , we suspect that not only does irradiation cause the prominence to become highly visible , but also causes it to be observable in some photospheric lines in which prominences in a normal , unirradiated environment would not normally emit . we have considered that the emission could be due to a wind launched from the accretion regions",
    ". such a wind , however , would exhibit a radial velocity modulation due to the orbital motion of the primary star which we do not observe .",
    "furthermore , presumably the velocities of material in such a wind would produce a far broader emission line than observed in bv cen .",
    "for these reasons , and the fact that it kinematically matches previous observations of slingshot prominences in cvs , we prefer the interpretation that this feature is the result of an irradiated prominence .",
    "we find that the emission feature in bv cen is very narrow , with a velocity width ( @xmath15 ) of @xmath11 10 km s@xmath10 .",
    "using this width we can place an upper limit on the emission source size , @xmath16 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume the prominence is co - rotating with the secondary star , so we can write , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the radial velocity amplitudes of the white dwarf and donor star , respectively , and @xmath20 is the orbital separation . for the parameters derived for bv cen in section  [ sec : pars ] , this places an upper limit of 75,000 km .",
    "naturally , the velocity dispersion is increased by instrumental resolution , thermal broadening , saturation broadening and turbulence within the prominence itself . for a 10,000 k prominence",
    "the thermal doppler velocity of hydrogen is 12.9 km s@xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ) . since the lines included in our lsd are mainly heavier elements such as fe and ca , the thermal broadening will be far smaller at @xmath112 km s@xmath10 .",
    "solar prominences exhibit turbulent motions of several km s@xmath10 , and @xcite estimate a turbulent velocity of 5 km s@xmath10 for the prominences observed on speedy mic .",
    "however , the dominant broadening mechanism is the @xmath119.5 km s@xmath10 instrumental resolution of our observations . considering these limitations , our estimated maximum source size of 75,000 km",
    "should be viewed with caution as it is possible that the source is actually unresolved .",
    "we have further analysed the lsd profiles to check whether or not we can see the zero - velocity prominence as it tracks across the stellar disc .",
    "we were unable to positively identify any feature with zero - velocity between phases 0.3740.522 during the first night s data .",
    "this may be due to the large emission bump feature that traverses the profile due to irradiation and/or starspots ( see section  [ sec : maps ] ) which probably masks the prominence itself .",
    "analysis of the second night s data , however , does reveal a narrow emission bump at zero - velocity between orbital phases 1.9742.058 .",
    "this is quite conspicuous ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sling ] ) as the emission feature moves across the profile in the opposite direction to the starspot features , and roche tomography is clearly unable to fit it .",
    "this agrees with the picture of a prominence holding material near the centre - of - mass of the binary , and that at orbital phase @xmath110 we are effectively looking over the top ( or possibly under the bottom ) of the star at the prominence on the other side .",
    "this , therefore , means that the prominence structure must be raised above or below the orbital plane in order for it not to be eclipsed by the donor star at this phase .",
    "given the lack of eclipse and the parameters found for bv cen in section  [ sec : pars ] , combined with the assumption that the prominence is located above the centre - of - mass of the binary ( the point of zero - velocity ) , we find that the prominence must lie at least 160,000 km above the orbital plane .",
    "if we assume that the prominence lies below the centre - of - mass ( i.e. we are looking ` underneath ' the star around phase 0 ) then it lies out of the orbital plane by at least 2,400,000 km .",
    "we feel that this latter case is highly unlikely .",
    "first , a prominence below the orbital plane is far more likely to be eclipsed by the accretion regions around orbital phase @xmath110.35 , when it is clearly seen in the data .",
    "second , if we assume that the prominence is only visible due to illumination from the accretion regions then a prominence below the orbital plane is located too far away from the irradiating source .",
    "three nights of consecutive ( albeit interrupted ) observations allows a limited discussion of the evolution of the slingshot prominence observed on bv cen .",
    "the prominence is certainly seen at the start of the first night ( @xmath21 = 0.3280.366 ) before it transits the stellar disc , where",
    "it then becomes invisible .",
    "we have assumed that , rather than the prominence disappearing at this point , its signature is lost in the complex structure present in the stellar line profile .",
    "we are able to pick up an emission feature with the same position in velocity space again at the start of the second night ( @xmath21 = 1.9742.038 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sling ] ) .    curiously",
    ", this prominence feature then disappears after orbital phase 2.038 . since , unlike the first night , the prominence on the second night appears quite clearly in the middle of the stellar line profile it is , on this occasion , difficult to explain how the feature could suddenly be lost within the stellar line",
    "this suggests that the disappearance may be due to rapid evolution of the prominence itself .",
    "indeed , it does seem as though the emission feature weakens during the second night before its apparent disappearance ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sling ] ) .",
    "though the interpretation of a prominence rapidly evolving on timescales of hours is speculative , @xcite also find evidence of individual prominences evolving on timescales of @xmath119 hours on speedy mic .",
    "certainly , we can find no evidence for the prominence feature on the 3rd night .",
    "this is despite the fact that the emission should be well separated from the stellar line profile after orbital phase 3.645 .",
    "this supports the idea that the prominence material is not long - lived , only lasting a couple of days before either draining back to the stellar surface or being ejected .",
    "@xcite found that , while some prominences on speedy mic were still visible after 5 nights , others formed or disappeared over the course of one night .    finally , unlike the prominences seen on speedy mic and ab dor which lie typically between 2 to 9 stellar radii from the stellar rotation axis ( with a concentration at the co - rotation radius ) , the feature observed in bv cen is far closer to the stellar surface .",
    "if the prominence is located above the centre - of - mass of the binary , then this places it just 1.5 r@xmath22 ( assuming the roche - lobe volume radius for bv cen ) from the rotation axis of the secondary star .",
    "although this is at odds with most h@xmath14 observations which show prominences at or beyond the co - rotation radius , clouds substantially closer to the stellar surface have been reported in hk aqr ( @xcite reported prominences 0.34  3.2 r@xmath22 above the stellar surface ) and re j1816 + 542 ( heights as low as 0.88 r@xmath22 , @xcite ) .",
    "the height of the prominence feature seen in bv cen also agrees with x - ray observations of rapidly - rotating isolated stars , even when h@xmath14 observations of prominences of the stars in question reveal high cloud heights .",
    "for instance , in chandra x - ray observations of ab dor , @xcite found that a significant fraction of the emission arose from compact regions near the stellar surface with heights of less than 0.3 r@xmath22 , and that the emitting corona does not extend more than 0.75 @xmath23 above the stellar surface .",
    "obviously , the formation mechanism of these prominences and active regions necessitates more work . in particular ,",
    "the apparent preference for ` slingshot prominences ' observed in cvs to form at low - velocity sites requires satisfactory explanation .",
    "we have shown that the donor star in bv cen is highly spotted , the second cv donor for which this has been shown to be the case .",
    "[ fig : plan ] highlights the striking similarities in spot distribution between bv cen and ae aqr , despite their quite different binary parameters and spectral types .",
    "although bv cen has a higher spot coverage and more low - latitude spots than ae aqr , both show a high latitude spot displaced towards the trailing hemisphere . it would be interesting if all donor stars in cvs showed high latitude spots displaced in the same direction .",
    "such a deflection could be the result of the orbital motion of the binary .",
    "since the rotation axis lies outside the donor stars in these binaries , one may expect the play of coriolis ( and/or centrifugal ) forces on magnetic flux tube emergence to be different from single stars .",
    "further observations , however , are required before we can definitely say that such a deflection of high - latitude spots takes place in cv donors .",
    "another striking similarity between the two tomograms presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : plan ] is the apparent chain of spots extending down from the polar regions to the @xmath1 point .",
    "this is more evident in the tomogram of ae aqr , but probably only because there are fewer low latitude features which allows these spots to stand - out more on ae aqr .",
    "we believe that this chain of spots is probably due to the impact of tidal forces due to the close proximity of a compact companion , and such a ` sub - white dwarf ' concentration of spots is also seen on the pre - cv v471 tau ( @xcite ) .",
    "a concentration of starspots on the inner face of the donor stars in cvs may also have consequences for the accretion dynamics of these objects .",
    "it has long been thought that starspots may be able to quench mass - transfer from the donor as they pass across the @xmath1 point , leading to the low - states seen in many cvs ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in their study of the mass - transfer history of am her , @xcite concluded that such a model would require an unusually high spot - coverage near the @xmath1 point , or otherwise some mechanism that drives spots towards the @xmath1 point .",
    "certainly , both ae aqr and bv cen do seem to show increased spot coverages towards the @xmath1 point in support of their conclusions .",
    "the fact that we see more active regions near the @xmath1 point may also explain why we appear to see a preference for ` slingshot prominences ' to form above the donors inner face ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite  and again in this work ) .",
    "certainly , the fact that prominence material at these locations will be illuminated by the accretion regions also means that observations will be biased towards detecting prominences in the region between the white dwarf and donor star in cvs .",
    "furthermore , if surface magnetic fields are strong enough in the neighbourhood of the @xmath1 point this may also cause fragmentation of the mass flow , resulting in the inhomogeneous or ` blobby ' accretion seen in some cvs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bv cen is the second cv donor star for which starspots have unambiguously been imaged on . again , as with ae aqr , we find a high ( 25 per cent ) spot coverage , and the high activity - level is further confirmed by the detection of a slingshot prominence .",
    "comparison with the roche tomograms of ae aqr from @xcite show many similarities between the two systems despite the quite different fundamental parameters of these two binaries .",
    "these spot distributions hint at the impact of tidal and/or coriolis forces on the emergence of magnetic flux tubes in these binaries , and suggest that the inner faces of cv donor stars are unusually heavily spotted . as always , further observations are recommended in order to confirm that such spot distributions are widely seen on cv donors .",
    "if a fixed spot distribution were to be found , this would also suggest that differential rotation is suppressed ( or at least weak ) in cv donors , as suggested by @xcite .",
