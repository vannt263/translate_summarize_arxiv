    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment is a long term project focusing on detection and monitoring of microlensing events in crowded fields . during the second phase of the experiment ,",
    "data are collected with the dedicated 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory ( lco ) , chile ( udalski , kubiak and szymaski 1997 ) . in 1997 , ogle started a monitoring program for two multiply imaged lensed quasars : qso 2237 + 0305 and he 1104 - 1805 . in qso 2237 + 0305 ( huchra s lens )",
    "one expects individual quasar images to vary due to microlensing in the bulge of the macrolensing galaxy ( webster et al .",
    "1991 , schneider et al .",
    "theoretical models predict high magnification events at caustic crossings .",
    "the sharpest features in the light curve provide in principle a size measurement of the source , in this case a quasar ( e.g. wambsganss et al . 1990 ) .",
    "this letter presents observations made in 1999 , previously unpublished except for a web site release .",
    "also we would like to call the attention of astronomical community to the fact that good photometry of qso 2237 + 0305 is available practically in real time , and encourage follow up programs .",
    "the ogle monitoring of huchra s lens is being carried out with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory , chile , which is operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the `` first generation '' camera uses a site @xmath2 ccd detector with @xmath3 pixels resulting in 0.417 arcsec / pixel scale .",
    "images of qso 2237 + 0305 are taken in normal mode ( still frame ) at `` medium '' readout speed with the gain 7.1 @xmath4/adu and readout noise of 6.3 @xmath4 .",
    "for the details of the instrumentation setup , we refer the reader to udalski , kubiak and szymaski ( 1997 ) .",
    "good seeing is essential for ground based measurements of huchra s lens .",
    "therefore , observations are restricted to nights with seeing better than about 1.4 arcsec , preferably with low sky background .",
    "the median fwhm of the seeing disk was 1.3 arcsec in the data presented here .",
    "in satisfactory weather conditions between late april and mid december , when qso 2237 + 0305 is visible from lco , two 4 minute exposures in the standard v photometric band are taken , shifted by few arc seconds with respect to each other .",
    "this can be done typically once or twice per week without a significant slow down of the primary program .",
    "the method which enabled reliable difference image photometry of qso 2237 + 0305 was developed by alard and lupton ( 1998 ) and further generalized for spatially variable kernels by alard ( 1999 ) . by taking the difference of each frame with the reference image ( a stack of 20 best frames )",
    "one avoids many complications associated with the presence of a barred spiral and the small separations of quasar images .",
    "the photometric pipeline consists of a set of stand - by programs for detections of stars , registration of frames with the reference frame , actual subtraction and fitting a 4 psf model of huchra s lens .",
    "a detailed description of the implementation can be found in woniak et al .",
    "the ogle ii data pipeline automatically detects new frames and performs bias and flat - field corrections ( udalski , kubiak , & szymaski 1997 ) .",
    "initially reduced frames are passed to image subtraction programs . within 10 minutes after exposure",
    "a new photometric point is e - mailed and can be posted on the ogle web page .",
    "however for practical reasons new data usually appear on the web the next morning .",
    "photometry of the four components of qso 2237 + 0305 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the light curve of the 18.14 mag comparison star is also included .",
    "the star was measured with exactly the same method as quasar images .",
    "wyithe et al . ( 2000 ) interpret these observations . based on their models",
    "we may expect a caustic crossing in the near future . in the upcoming 2000 observing season for qso 2237 + 0305 , the time sampling of our photometry should be comparable to the season of 1999 .",
    "after september 2000 ogle will suspend operation for an upgrade .",
    "observations will resume in season of 2001 .",
    "machine readable data can be obtained from the ogle web page at http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/@xmath0ftp/ogle and its usa mirror http://www.astro.princeton/@xmath0ogle . )"
