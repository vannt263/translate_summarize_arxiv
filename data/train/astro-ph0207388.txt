    "we have also included @xmath13 gem which is just hotter than 9000  k , but the results are in agreement with its fundamental and irfm @xmath6 values .    the rapidly rotating star @xmath4 aql has recently been studied by van belle et al .",

    "in addition , the balmer profiles change little with relatively large changes in @xmath6 .",

    "however , until we do have stars with accurate fundamental @xmath3 values , we can not be totally sure that there is not a problem with the model predictions in this @xmath6 region .",
    "balmer line profiles have been fitted to the fundamental binary systems . to within the errors of the fundamental @xmath6 values , neither the h@xmath4 or h@xmath5 profiles exhibit any significant discrepancies for the cm and mlt without approximate overshooting models . as in previous work ,",
    "the mlt with overshooting models are found to be discrepant",
    ". moreover , there are no systematic trends , such as offsets , between results from h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 as long as @xmath4 in mlt models is chosen small enough ( e.g. 0.5 ) .",
    "the discrepancies exhibited by the fundamental @xmath6 stars in gardiner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) can be explained by rapid rotation in two cases and by the fact that the balmer profiles become sensitive to @xmath3 and less sensitive to @xmath6 in the other two cases .",
    "however , for the time being the lack of any stars with fundamental values of both @xmath6 and @xmath3 in this region precludes the conclusion that there is not a problem with the models in the @xmath6 range 8000 @xmath0 9000  k.      this work has made use of the hardware and software provided at keele by the pparc starlink project .",
