    "it was realized relatively early that the transverse momenta of initial ( before a hard process ) partons may play an important role in order to understand the distributions of produced direct photons , especially at small transverse momenta ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "the simplest way to include parton transverse momenta is via gaussian smearing @xcite@xcite .",
    "this phenomenological approach is not completely justified theoretically .",
    "the unintegrated parton distribution functions ( updfs ) are the basic theoretical quantities that take into account explicitly the parton transverse momenta .",
    "the updfs have been studied recently in the context of different high - energy processes @xcite@xcite .",
    "these works concentrated mainly on gluon degrees of fredom which play the dominant role in many processes at very high energies . at somewhat lower energies also quark and antiquark degrees of freedom become equally important .",
    "recently the approach which dynamically includes transverse momenta of not only gluons but also of quarks and antiquarks was applied to direct - photon production @xcite .    up to now",
    "there is no complete agreement how to include evolution effects into the building blocks of the high - energy processes  the unintegrated parton distributions . in ref .",
    "we have discussed in detail a few approaches how to include transverse momenta of the incoming partons in order to calculate distributions of direct photons .",
    "in general , there are no simple relations between unintegrated and integrated parton distributions .",
    "some of updfs in the literature are obtained based on familiar collinear distributions , some are obtained by solving evolution equations , some are just modelled or some are even parametrized . a brief review of unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugdfs ) can be found in ref .  .    in some of the approaches mentioned above one",
    "imposes the following relation between the standard collinear distributions and updfs : @xmath1 where @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "since familiar collinear distributions satisfy sum rules , one can define and test analogous sum rules for updfs .",
    "we have discussed this issue in more detail in ref .  .",
    "some other approaches for updfs are discussed e.g. in ref .  .",
    "the cross section for the production of a photon and an associated parton ( jet ) can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are transverse momenta of incoming partons . in the leading - order approximation : @xmath7 , etc .",
