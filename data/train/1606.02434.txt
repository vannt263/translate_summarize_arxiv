    "it has been claimed that this results in an additional @xmath15 contribution to the magnetic moment , which is not captured by the @xmath15 qed correction from the four - loop vacuum polarization function  @xcite .",
    "this claim has been quickly refuted @xcite  indeed , it is clear from ( [ aevp ] ) that the vacuum polarization is probed only in the euclidean region far from the electron - positron threshold , where an ordinary loop expansion is valid  , but the arguments presented leave an interesting point open , namely whether and how an order - by - order calculation of the spectral function gives the correct result for the magnetic moment when the dispersive representation ( [ dispaevp ] ) is used .",
    "the answer to this question , which we provide in this note , leads to more general considerations on the formulation of the dispersion relation for spectral functions whose perturbative expansions become more and more singular near pair - production thresholds as the order of the expansion increases .",
    "this in turn has interesting ramifications for pair production of heavy particles such as top quarks at the large hadron collider as will be discussed .",
    "the vacuum polarization function develops poles of @xmath12 bound states right below the electron - positron threshold .",
    "they can not be obtained at any finite order in qed perturbation theory , but arise diagrammatically from the summation of an infinite number of coulomb - photon exchanges between the electron and positron .",
    "the systematic resummation can be performed within the framework of non - relativistic effective field theory , and the relevant counting is @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the summation generates the bound - state poles and also significantly affects the @xmath19 continuum near threshold . for the present discussion of @xmath15 effects both",
    "are adequately described by the leading - order coulomb green function .",

    "the coulomb green function sums terms of order @xmath24 to all orders in @xmath2 through the digamma function @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , and the poles of the digamma function at positive integer @xmath27 correspond to the @xmath28-wave positronium bound states .",
    "the imaginary part of the green function for real energies reads @xmath29 where the second term is the continuum contribution known as the sommerfeld factor and the positronium bound states at energies @xmath30 are explicit in the first term .",
    "we shall now compute the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment in two ways .",
    "first , `` non - perturbative '' , that is , using the all - order resummed spectral function above .",
    "second , we show that exactly the same result can be obtained at fixed five - loop order in perturbation theory .",
    "we then explain why this implies that no additional contribution has to be added to the known result  @xcite .    for the `` non - perturbative '' ,",
    "resummed evaluation we multiply ( [ eq : img0 ] ) by @xmath31 and insert the result into ( [ dispaevp ] ) , obtaining @xmath32 the first term represents the positronium contribution . at @xmath16",
    "we can neglect the @xmath33 corrections , and the expression evaluates to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the integral over the continuum spectral function contains lower order contributions starting from @xmath36 , which are of no interest here , and is divergent at large @xmath20 , which is an artifact , since the employed approximation to @xmath37 applies only for small @xmath38 .",
    "subtracting the lower order contributions and applying a cut - off @xmath39 to the energy integral , we are left with @xmath40 note that we are allowed and must choose @xmath41 such that @xmath42 in order to include the non - perturbative modification of the threshold region .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the largest contribution to the integral is @xmath43 and arises from the region @xmath44 , while for @xmath45 the integrand behaves as @xmath46 and hence the contribution from that region is at most of order @xmath47 .",
    "this allows us to set the upper integration limit @xmath41 to infinity and to obtain the analytic result @xmath48 ( already given in @xcite ) for the above expression ( [ eq : contint ] ) . to the integrand factor in ( [ eq : contint ] ) and to compute @xmath49 which extracts the contribution from @xmath50 , which can not be obtained from the taylor expansion of the integrand in @xmath2 . ]",

    "this step , while mathematically correct , is nevertheless physically somewhat dubious , since it should not be necessary to appeal to the behaviour of the coulomb green function outside its range of applicability .",
    "2 ) the direct expansion in @xmath2 of @xmath37 in ( [ eq : img0 ] ) using @xmath66 would yield the wrong result , namely @xmath67_{{\\cal o}(\\alpha^4 ) } & = \\frac{\\pi \\alpha^4\\zeta_3}{4 } \\ , m \\delta(e)\\ , , \\label{eq : img0pert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which differs from the correct result ( [ eq : impipert ] ) by a factor of two .",
    "one must either integrate the resummed spectral function properly _ or _ derive the perturbative spectral function from the expansion of @xmath68 in the distribution sense .",
    "3 ) although the threshold contribution ( [ eq : resummed2 ] ) or ( [ eq : f ) ] ) is non - zero , this does _ not _ imply that it has to be added to the result of  @xcite . in this paper @xmath4",
    "is computed directly , and ( [ aevp ] ) is employed to obtain the anomalous magnetic moment , hence the subtlety of the threshold - localized @xmath60 in term in the four - loop spectral function never arises .",
    "]    the @xmath69-loop vacuum polarization behaves as @xmath70 when @xmath71 .",
    "the existence of non - integrable singularities at the @xmath12 threshold starting at @xmath11 calls for a careful analysis of the dispersion relation ( [ disprel ] ) . the first equality in ( [ disprel ] )",
    "holds order by order , hence @xmath72 the integration contour in the variable @xmath20 ( with @xmath73 ) is drawn in figure  [ fig : intcircuit ] .",
    "for the terms relevant in this paper the functions @xmath74 have a two - particle cut starting at @xmath13 , equivalently @xmath75 . in order to avoid touching the singular point at @xmath75 , we separate an infinitesimal circle @xmath76 of radius @xmath77 , parametrized as @xmath78 , @xmath79 from the remainder of the integration contour . the straight lines above and below the cut extend from @xmath77 to @xmath80 and involve the difference @xmath81 with @xmath57 positive - infinitesimal .",
    "the circle at infinity does not contribute to the once - subtracted dispersion relation , hence ( [ polfunc ] ) can be written as @xmath82 the contribution from the small circle @xmath83 vanishes for @xmath84 , if the vacuum polarization is less singular than @xmath55 at @xmath75 ; however , this condition is not satisfied in general . for the computation of the small - circle contribution @xmath85 we can use the expansion @xmath86 of @xmath87 around threshold .",

    "the next - to - leading term @xmath91 is suppressed by @xmath92 , and equals the leading - order one times an @xmath93 hard matching coefficient  @xcite : @xmath94 similarly , @xmath95 can be extracted from the non - relativistic expansion of vacuum polarization at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , and so on .",

    "once @xmath97 is included , integrals logarithmic in energy appear , but the generalization of the considerations below to this case is straightforward . since we are only interested in the region @xmath98 , we can expand the denominators in the integrands of ( [ disprele ] ) in @xmath99 and @xmath100",

    "<S> 0.2cmwe show how to correctly treat threshold singularities in fixed - order perturbative calculations of the electron anomalous magnetic moment and hadronic pair production processes such as top pair production . </S>",
    "<S> with respect to the former , we demonstrate the equivalence of the `` non - perturbative '' , resummed treatment of the vacuum polarization contribution , whose spectral function exhibits bound state poles , with the fixed - order calculation by identifying a threshold localized term in the four - loop spectral function . in general , we find that a modification of the dispersion relation by threshold subtractions is required to make fixed - order calculations well - defined and provide the subtraction term . </S>",
    "<S> we then solve the apparent problem of a divergent convolution of the partonic cross section with the parton luminosity in the computation of the top pair production cross section starting from the fourth - order correction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the computation is performed in the usual way as an integral of real and virtual corrections over phase space at a given order in the expansion in the strong coupling , an additional contribution has to be added at n3lo .    </S>",
