    "the study of @xmath0 interactions at the hera collider , where 26.7 gev electrons collide with 820 gev protons , has lead to the observation of many interesting effects , with highlights such as the strong rise of the proton structure function @xmath9 in the region of low bjorken @xmath10 even at moderate momentum transfers @xmath11  @xcite and the production of large rapidity gap ( lrg ) events in the deep inelastic neutral current interactions  @xcite and in high @xmath1 jet photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "particles produced in inelastic , non diffractive hadron hadron interactions , are known to populate a cylindrical phase space ( with limited @xmath1 ) available for their production , with three characteristic domains : the two fragmentation regions corresponding to the initial beam particles and the central region .",
    "a similar picture emerges in @xmath0 interactions  @xcite when viewed from the @xmath12 frame after removing the scattered electron . on the other hand particles originating from a diffractively excited @xmath13",
    "will only populate the photon fragmentation region and lead to a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) extending through ( part of ) the central and proton fragmentation regions .",
    "the initial study of the lrg events observed in nc dis interactions at hera  @xcite led to the conclusion that : ( 1 ) the @xmath14 dependence was consistent with originating from a leading twist effect , ( 2 ) the ratio of lrg events to all the events was almost constant with @xmath15 , ( 3 ) a small fraction of about 3% of the lrg events had large @xmath1 jets in the final state , thus leading to a picture of predominantly soft hadronic configurations .",
    "the emerging picture was consistent with the assumption of a dis scattering on a quark originating from a pomeron like object , in good agreement with models such as that of ingelman - schlein  @xcite , donnachie ",
    "landshoff  @xcite or of nikolaev - zakharov  @xcite .",
    "the zeus detector  @xcite consists of the vertex detector , the central tracking chamber , the high resolution uranium / scintillator calorimeter ( cal ) and a muon spectrometer consisting in turn of an iron backing calorimeter sandwiched between precision muon chambers . in the forward ( defined along the momentum vector of the incoming proton ) and rear ( defined by the momentum vector of the incoming electron ) directions the tracking is supplemented by the forward and rear tracking chambers .",
    "the maximal rapidity acceptance is given by the cal and extends from 4.2 to -3.8 units of pseudorapidity @xmath16 ( @xmath17 with @xmath18 the polar angle measured with respect to the proton direction ) .    a leading proton spectrometer , lps , consisting of a chain of roman pots surrounding the beam pipe is located in the forward region to tag and measure diffractive photon dissociation reactions . a forward neutron calorimeter , fnc , has been designed to tag high energy neutrons originating from the @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the luminosity is determined by measuring the integrated bethe - heitler photon spectrum ( @xmath19 ) , measured in the luminosity gamma detector located downstream of the electron beam .",
    "the @xmath0 interactions are classified as nc dis if the scattered electron is detected in the cal and as photoproduction otherwise .",
    "the separation occurs typically for photon virtualities of @xmath20  gev@xmath21 .    in this presentation",
    "the operational definition of diffractive events is adopted following bjorken  @xcite :  a diffractive process occurs if and only if there is a large rapidity gap in the produced particle phase space which is not exponentially suppressed .  in the hera regime diffractive photon dissociation can be tagged by a presence of a lrg for masses up to about 20 gev which can be fully contained in the acceptance region of the central detector .       to select large rapidity gap events we define for each event @xmath22 as the @xmath16 of an energy deposit in the detector above 400 mev closest to the proton direction .",
    "the distribution of @xmath22 for selected dis nc events with @xmath23  gev@xmath21 is presented in figure  [ etadis ] and compared with a dis monte carlo ( mc ) based on the color dipole model ( ariadne  @xcite ) for the production of the hadronic final state .",
    "a clear excess of events with large rapidity gaps is observed , in the region of @xmath24 which corresponds to an effective rapidity gap of more than 2 units of @xmath16 in the detector and possibly more than 5 units of @xmath16 relative to the initial proton . in the mc",
    "the lrg events are strongly suppressed in this region .",
    "the lrg events can be described by the following set of inclusive variables : the negative of the four momentum transfer squared between the incoming and the scattered electron ",
    "@xmath14 ; the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark determined by bjorken @xmath10 ; the invariant mass of the hadronic final state @xmath15 equal to the center of mass energy of the @xmath12 system ; the square of the momentum transfer , @xmath25 , between the initial and final proton ; the invariant mass of the hadrons excluding the final state proton , @xmath26 ; and finally the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the ( generic ) pomeron @xmath27 .",
    "it is customary to introduce a variable which denotes the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the struck quark , @xmath28 .",
    "assuming @xmath29 and neglecting the mass of the proton @xmath30 to study the factorization properties of lrg events it is convenient to rewrite the differential dis @xmath0 cross section as a function of @xmath31 and @xmath27 , @xmath32 f^{d(3)}_2 ( \\beta , q^2,x_{{{i\\!\\!p } } } ) \\ , , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath33 with @xmath34 the @xmath0 center of mass energy squared and @xmath35 denotes the contribution of lrg events with a given @xmath27 integrated over @xmath25 to the @xmath9 structure function of the proton for a given @xmath14 and @xmath36 . for simplicity the contribution from the @xmath37 structure function has been omitted in the above formula .",
    "should the mechanism of diffractive production in dis be similar to that ruling the soft hadron hadron interactions , the @xmath35 is expected to factorize into a flux factor @xmath38 and the structure function of the pomeron @xmath39 : @xmath40 .",
    "moreover if the lrg events are induced by the @xmath41 trajectory of the regge phenomenology , @xmath42 with @xmath43  @xcite and @xmath44 gev@xmath45 , the @xmath27 dependence of the flux integrated over @xmath25 is expected to be @xmath46 the term of @xmath47 comes from the slope of the @xmath41 trajectory and the variation depends on the assumed @xmath25 dependence of the diffractive peak ( @xmath48 with @xmath49 gev@xmath45 ) .",
    "the structure function @xmath50 would then depend on the partonic structure of the pomeron .",
    "this is the essence of the ingelman ",
    "schlein  @xcite and donnachie ",
    "landshoff  @xcite models for diffraction in dis .",
    "note that the separation of @xmath35 into a flux term and @xmath50 is not unique since the normalization of @xmath50 is not known .",
    "in the nikolaev - zakharov model  @xcite the pomeron is modelled by a two gluon exchange with an addition of multi  gluon exchanges parameterized by the triple regge formula .",
    "this leads to an explicit factorization breaking , although the effect is small . in the model of capella",
    "@xcite the flux of the @xmath41 is determined by the intercept of the bare pomeron and the structure function of the @xmath41 is related to that of the deuterium .",
    "the results reported here correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.54 pb@xmath51 collected during the 1993 running period .",
    "the selection of events on the basis of the @xmath52 cut leads to a very clean sample of lrg events , yet it restricts the analysis to relatively small masses ( typically @xmath53 ) . the efficiency to select larger masses",
    "can be improved at the expense of an increased background from the non - diffractive dis events . in the analysis presented here the lrg events",
    "were selected requiring @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where the sum runs over all calorimeter clusters assigned to the hadronic final state .",
    "the latter cut allows to separate large mass diffractive events which do not exhibit a lrg in the calorimeter from non - diffractive events in which due to the fragmentation of the proton system the hadronic energy measured in the forward calorimeter is large and thus @xmath56 .",
    "the remaining background from non - diffractive events is estimated with the dis mc based on the color dipole model including boson gluon fusion diagrams  @xcite and subtracted . the contribution from double diffractive dissociation",
    "is estimated to be @xmath57 and is not subtracted .",
    "it is assumed to be independent of @xmath27 .",
    "only events with @xmath58 were used in the analysis .",
    "the upper cut is applied in order to limit the contribution from the unknown longitudinal structure function for the lrg component .",
    "= 90 mm       the results of the @xmath35 determination are presented in bins of @xmath59 and @xmath14 as a function of @xmath27 in figure  [ f2d3 ] .",
    "the data can be well represented by a fit of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is kept fixed for all @xmath59 , @xmath14 bins and @xmath62 is a constant allowed to vary from bin to bin .",
    "the result of the fit yields @xmath63 all the data are well described by @xmath64 with no @xmath14 dependence .",
    "the result of the fit is presented in figure  [ f2d3 ] .",
    "it is within errors compatible with diffractive production being driven by the soft @xmath41 .",
    "we define @xmath65 as @xmath66    = 90 mm       the @xmath59 dependence for fixed @xmath14 values and the @xmath14 dependence for fixed @xmath59 values of @xmath65 is presented in figure  [ f2bq2 ] .",
    "the @xmath59 distribution is compared to the form @xmath67 expected in the splitting of the @xmath41 into a @xmath68 pair .",
    "a clear excess of low @xmath59 events is observed . within the statistical and systematic errors",
    "the result is compatible with no @xmath14 dependence even at the largest value of @xmath59 .",
    "= 90 mm       the comparison with the various models discussed above presented in figure  [ models ] shows that the models of nikolaev - zakharov and of capella et al .",
    "give the best description of the data .",
    "the model of donnachie  landshoff reproduces the data well in the region of @xmath69 where the contribution of the @xmath70 trajectory is negligible . the original model of ingelman ",
    "schlein ( not shown ) , which assumes that quarks saturate the momentum sum rule for the @xmath41 overestimates the cross section by a large factor .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath71 dependence on @xmath27 , @xmath59 and @xmath14 is also well reproduced by the model of buchmueller and hebecker  @xcite which does not use the concept of the pomeron , but rather describes the production of lrg through one gluon exchange with a non - perturbative color cancellation induced by wee partons .",
    "the first observation of the partonic substructure of diffractive proton dissociation was reported by the ua8 experiment  @xcite in two jet production associated with a tagged leading proton .",
    "an analogous measurement was performed by zeus  @xcite where large @xmath1 jet production was studied for photoproduction events with a lrg , @xmath72 .",
    "the inclusive cross section @xmath73 was determined in the energy range @xmath74 for @xmath75 , requiring the transverse jet energy @xmath76 .",
    "the cross section was then compared with expectations of a model in which jet production with a lrg in the forward region is due to a hard scattering between the partons of the pomeron and the photon .",
    "both the direct photon and resolved photon contribution were taken into account , with the @xmath77 structure function as given by the gs  ho parameterization  @xcite .",
    "the flux of the @xmath41 was assumed to be given by the donnachie ",
    "landshoff parameterization  @xcite and the pomeron was assumed to consists of either only quarks or only gluons , soft or hard , in each case saturating the momentum sum rule . the results of the comparison are shown in figure  [ etajet ] .",
    "= 80 mm       also shown is the contribution expected from fluctuations of the hadronic final state in non - diffractive jet photoproduction .",
    "the excess of events with lrg is best described by a pomeron consisting of hard gluons .",
    "it is clear though that a combination of gluons and quarks would also reproduce the cross section .",
    "the photoproduction data alone can not be used to decompose the content of the pomeron without further assumptions about the flux of the @xmath41 and the associated momentum sum rule .",
    "the dis data on the @xmath71 structure function , sensitive to the quark content , and the jet photoproduction cross section , sensitive to both the quark and gluon content , can be combined to estimate the percentage of the @xmath41 momentum carried by the quarks and the gluons .",
    "this is done in the following way .",
    "the pomeron flux is assumed to be the same in photoproduction and in dis and given by the donnachie ",
    "landshoff parameterization .",
    "the shape of the quark distribution is taken as determined from the dis measurement and is normalized to one .",
    "the gluon distribution is assumed to be of the form @xmath67 and also normalized to one .",
    "then both the dis and the jet photoproduction cross sections are calculated assuming that the gluons carry @xmath78 fraction of the pomeron momentum , the rest being carried by the quarks . for each @xmath78 the overall normalization @xmath79 needed to reproduce the measured cross section is determined separately for the two reactions .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ pomcon ] .",
    "= 80 mm       the region where the @xmath79 is the same for both reactions determines the gluon content of the pomeron .",
    "this happens for @xmath80 , where the range is determined by the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the cross section measurements . note that this result does not depend on the assumed pomeron flux , nor on the contribution of the proton dissociation .",
    "it is also independent of any assumption on the validity of the momentum sum rule for the pomeron .",
    "the conclusion is thus that the gluon content of the pomeron is substantial .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from the lack of @xmath14 evolution of @xmath50 at large @xmath59 , assuming that the dglap evolution equation applies to the pomeron  @xcite . since , as is the case for the proton , parton radiation leads to the depletion of quarks at large @xmath59 ( @xmath10 in the proton case ) , the only way to compensate this depletion is by adding quarks from another source - gluon radiation of quarks .",
    "these gluons have to be then at @xmath81 .",
    "the numerical estimate of this effect can be found in  @xcite .",
    "another example of a reaction which leads to lrg in the final states of electroproduction is the exclusive production of vector mesons  ( see contribution by j. whitmore to this conference ) such as @xmath82 . the previously existing data from photoproduction  @xcite and electroproduction  @xcite were compatible with expectations based on the pomeron phenomenology . in a model proposed by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite",
    "the @xmath41 consists of two non  perturbative gluons and the large @xmath14 @xmath83 production cross section is predicted to have the following form : @xmath84 where the @xmath10 dependence of the @xmath85 is determined by the intercept of the soft @xmath41 . thus the @xmath2 production cross section is expected to rise only slowly with @xmath15 , @xmath86 .",
    "= 85 mm       this expectation is to be contrasted with the recent calculation of brodsky et al .",
    "@xcite which leads within perturbative qcd to a similar formula as the one of donnachie and landshoff but where , for a longitudinally polarized virtual photon at @xmath87 , the gluon distribution entering the formula is that of the proton , as measured in dis . in this case one expects the cross section to rise almost linearly with @xmath15 .",
    "the zeus measurements of @xmath88 for photoproduction  @xcite and for @xmath89 and @xmath90  @xcite are presented in figure  [ sigmarho ] and compared with measurements at lower @xmath15 . while the photoproduction cross section is slowly rising with @xmath15 , that for @xmath91 exhibits a much stronger increase relative to lower @xmath15 data . in accordance with expectations the contribution of longitudinally polarized photons was found to be larger than that of the transversely polarized one ( assuming @xmath34 channel helicity conservation ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath14 dependence turns out to be @xmath92 with @xmath93 , again closer to the expectation of the perturbative calculations in which the increase of the gluon density with @xmath14 compensates partly the @xmath94 dependence due to the two gluon exchange  @xcite .",
    "the production of large rapidity gap events in @xmath0 interactions at hera has opened a unique opportunity to study diffractive dissociation in reactions associated with at least one hard scale , like the deep inelastic scattering or production of large transverse momenta jets .",
    "the emerging picture , if interpreted in terms of a factorizable pomeron exchange , leads to a pomeron consisting of quarks and gluons with a rather hard momentum distribution .",
    "the appearance of jets in the deep inelastic scattering and the large cross section for vector meson production measured at large @xmath14 and large center of mass energies could well be due to a perturbative mechanism , implying a more complicated nature of the pomeron .",
