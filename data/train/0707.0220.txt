    "ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic grains dispersed in a solvent . to keep such dispersions stable , one must avoid aggregation and counterbalance the attractive van der waals interaction by repulsive forces , either electrostatic ones , if the particles are charged , or steric ones , if their surface is coated with polymers or surfactants . each particle of a ferrofluid possesses a permanent magnetic dipole moment so that the ferrocolloids have much in common with dipolar liquids @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction of such magnetic particles can be modeled by the stockmayer potential , which is the sum of an isotropic lennard - jones ( lj ) and the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction @xcite . within this approach",
    "the lj interaction parameters are considered to be effective ones , incorporating the effects of the solvent .",
    "( in a more refined approach one would model the suspension as a binary mixture of a nonpolar solvent and a polar solute component @xcite . )",
    "based on previous experience @xcite , here we substitute the lennard - jones potential by a hard core yukawa potential . for a homogeneous isotropic dipolar yukawa ( dy )",
    "fluid this substitution provides the valuable benefit that one can solve analytically the corresponding ornstein - zernike equation within the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) .",
    "it turns out that the thermodynamic properties of a dy fluid can be calculated easily from the corresponding results for a hard core yukawa and a dipolar hard sphere ( dhs ) fluid .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of a dy fluid differ from those of the dhs fluid but the magnetic susceptibility of the dy fluid is the same as that of the dhs fluid , which was predicted first by wertheim @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the msa is that it can predict the magnetization only for weak magnetic fields because it is a linear response theory . in order to eliminate this shortcoming ,",
    "first lebedev @xcite suggested a semi - empirical method for using msa at finite magnetic fields .",
    "later morozov and lebedev @xcite extended the applicability of dhs msa to the case of arbitrary strengths of the magnetic fields on the basis of the lovett - mou - buff equation @xcite , relating the single particle distribution function and the direct correlation function . within the framework of density functional theory , here",
    "we also propose an equation for the magnetization of ferrofluids , which turns out to be simpler than the corresponding equation of morozov and lebedev @xcite . in order to facilitate the calculation of the phase diagrams , we present also the magnetic field dependence of the chemical potential and of the pressure .",
    "we study so - called hard core dipolar yukawa fluids which consist of spherically symmetric particles interacting via a yukawa ( y ) potential characterized by parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 : @xmath3 . \\label{yu}\\ ] ] in addition there is a dipolar interaction due to point dipoles embedded at the centres of the particles : @xmath4 with the rotationally invariant function @xmath5 [ \\widehat{\\mathbf{m}}_2(\\omega_2)\\cdot\\widehat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12 } ] -[\\widehat{\\mathbf{m}}_1(\\omega_1)\\cdot\\widehat{\\mathbf{m}}_2(\\omega_2 ) ] , \\label{d}\\ ] ] where particle 1 ( 2 ) is located at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and carries a dipole moment of strength @xmath8 with an orientation given by the unit vector @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) with polar angles @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ; @xmath13 is the difference vector between the centres of particle 1 and 2 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a unit vector with orientation @xmath16 .",
    "the hard core dipolar yukawa potential is defined by the aforementioned interaction potentials as @xmath17 in the following we consider the dy fluid in a homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath18 ( the direction of which is taken to coincide with the direction of the @xmath19 axis ) .",
    "the contribution of the latter to the interaction potential is @xmath20 where the angle @xmath21 measures the orientation of the dipole of a single particle relative to the field direction .",
    "in general , an inhomogeneous and anisotropic dipolar fluid is described by the one particle distribution function @xmath22 . for bulk fluid",
    "phases the number density @xmath23 is spatially constant and @xmath24 is the orientational distribution function at the point @xmath25 . in a homogeneously magnetized bulk phase",
    "the orientational distribution function depends only on @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and it is normalized to 1 , i.e. , @xmath28 . in these terms",
    "our subsequent bulk analysis is based on the minimization of the following grand canonical variational functional : @xmath29= f_{dy}[\\rho,\\{\\alpha(\\omega)\\},t ] -\\int{d^3rd\\omega\\rho\\alpha(\\omega)(\\mu - u_{ext}(\\omega))},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the helmholtz free energy functional of the dy fluid , @xmath31 is the temperature and @xmath32 is the chemical potential .",
