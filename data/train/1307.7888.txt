    "furthermore , assessing rigorously the stability of material surfaces requires an accurate characterization of the fate of infinitesimally small perturbations to such surfaces . using the fsle in locating lcss accurately , therefore , is a diversion from its original mandate , the description of finite - size perturbations to trajectories .",
    "here we discuss in detail some marked differences between the fsle and ftle that contradict the broadly presumed equivalence of these two scalar fields .",
    "the differences stem from irregularities of the fsle field , which include local ill - posedness , spurious ridges , insensitivity to changes in the dynamics past the separation time , and intrinsic jump - discontinuities .",
    "families of such jump - discontinuity surfaces turn out to be generically present in any nonlinear flow , creating sensitivity in fsle computations with respect to the temporal resolution of the underlying flow data .",
    "we also establish mathematical conditions under which select fsle ridges do signal the presence of nearby ftle ridges , which in turn mark hyperbolic lcss under further conditions . the key tool used in proving this result",

    "the separation rates in this maximization are compared over a common length of time @xmath25 , and hence describe the stretching properties of the flow map @xmath26 near @xmath3 .",
    "an alternative assessment of separation in the flow is provided by the finite - size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) .",
    "as already noted in the introduction , for a fixed separation factor @xmath1 , and initial separation @xmath0 , the separation time @xmath2 is defined as @xmath27 from which the fsle field @xmath28 is computed as in .",
    "the only setting in which fsle and ftle are directly related by a formula is that of linear dynamical systems .",
    "such systems exhibit spatially homogeneous separation properties at all scales , and hence the quantities @xmath6 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are all independent of the initial condition @xmath3 and the initial separation @xmath4 .",

    "more generally , the philosophy behind computing fsle is not in line with classical , observation - driven assessments of flow properties between fixed initial and final times .",
    "all basic concepts in dynamical systems and lagrangian continuum mechanics build on properties of the flow map , and hence fall in the latter observational category . specifically , material surfaces that show locally extreme repulsion or attraction over a fixed observational period ( i.e. , hyperbolic lcss ) have no immediate connection with the fsle field .",
    "despite the above conceptual differences between the ftle and fsle , they are often assumed to be operationally equivalent . below we give several reasons why such an equivalence can not hold in general .      while the ftle is well - defined for any choice of its arguments ( any initial condition and integration time ) , the fsle is not defined at @xmath3 if the local separation around @xmath3 never reaches @xmath32-times the initial separation over the duration of the available velocity data .",

    ", the fsle will become insensitive to any further changes in stretching rates along a trajectory @xmath48 .",
    "by contrast , the ftle , when computed over increasing integration times , keeps monitoring the same trajectory beyond the time @xmath2 , continually revising the averaged largest exponential stretching rate along @xmath48 .",
    "for instance , consider the incompressible flow @xmath49 with the smooth function @xmath34 again defined as in .",
    "this flow turns from a linear saddle into a nonlinear saddle gradually over the @xmath35 $ ] time interval .",

    "example [ ex : ridge_nocont ] shows that in flows violating this requirement , either no or several @xmath121-close ftle ridges may exist .",
    "therefore , the types of conditions required in are indeed necessary for fsle ridges to be meaningful in hyperbolic lcs detection , even though the constants arising in these conditions are not readily computable from our proof .",
    "while select fsle ridges signal the presence of nearby ftle ridges by theorem [ thm : ridge2ridge ] , this does not imply that there is always a corresponding hyperbolic lcs in the flow .",
