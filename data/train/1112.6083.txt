    "the spectral properties of quasars in ultraviolet - optical range have been a subject of a number of studies .",
    "the smooth part ( continuum ) of this uv bump , called the `` big blue bump '' , is traditionally considered to be thermal emission from an accretion disk , while the emission lines are attributed to this emission reprocessed in surrounding clumped gas in a form of broad and narrow line regions ( blr and nlr ) as well as in a dust obscured torus , but many details of this paradigm are still purely understood , as well as the nature of broad absorption lines ( bal ) , possessed by about 10% of quasars .",
    "thus , on the one hand , the detailed study of the quasar spectra plays an important role in understanding of the quasar nature . on the other hand , the accurate quasar spectrum shape , which does not vary significantly from one object to another ,",
    "is needed as a template for quasar redshift measurements in large redshift surveys .",
    "finally , the precise knowledge of the intrinsic quasar spectrum shape , prior to absorption in intergalactic medium , is required for studying the intergalactic gas , manifested as absorption features in the quasar spectra , first of all as the hydrogen ly@xmath0-forest .    in all of the fields , mentioned above the composite ( mean ) spectra",
    "are widely used .",
    "the possibility of their utilisation is related to the fact that quasar spectra are remarkably similar from one object to another . due to their high signal - to - noise ratio composite spectra",
    "reveal weak features that are rarely detectable in individual quasar spectra .",
    "the composite spectra were compiled for a wide set of quasar samples , e.g. the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) @xcite , the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , quasar spectra from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite , and far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) @xcite .",
    "the part of uv - optical quasar spectrum redward of the ly@xmath0 ( 1215.67 ) emission line ( free of hydrogen lyman - series forests of absorption lines ) is studied quite well . as it was shown e.g. by @xcite this region up to @xmath7",
    "is described with a smooth continuum , well approximated with a power law @xmath8 over some limited wavelength range , broad emission and , in some cases , absorption lines .",
    "@xcite reported on @xmath1 to be @xmath9 within 13504230 , that agrees well with the values @xmath9 and @xmath10 which were obtained by @xcite within 14505050  for spectra from lbqs and fbqs respectively , and also with the results of @xcite , who obtained the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 within 13003000  and 30004500   ranges respectively for a sample of radio - loud quasars . throughout this paper",
    "the indicated wavelengths are rest - frame ones , unless other is specified .",
    "the most complete to - date list of emission lines redward of the ly@xmath0 emission line found in quasar composite can be found in @xcite .",
    "some statistical studies were also conducted with samples of individual spectra , e.g. @xcite studied the strong uv and optical emission line properties using a sample of 85 bright quasars .",
    "the part of the spectrum blueward of the ly@xmath0 emission line , used for the ly@xmath0-forest studies , is much worse investigated due to the presence of the lyman series forests .",
    "direct reconstruction of intrinsic quasar spectral shape in this region is possible only for high resolution spectra , the number of which is not large , that does not allow to conduct statistical studies of the subsamples with different characteristics , e.g. luminosity",
    ". several - parametric modelling of the continuum level within the ly@xmath0 forest region suffers from the degeneration between the mean transmission and parameters of lines and continuum , that is why extrapolation of the continuum from the red part of spectrum seems to be more reliable in some cases ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but in practice it is only an approximation of the real continuum , because the centre of the `` big blue bump '' is located at @xmath13 .",
    "this is confirmed by the values of @xmath1 obtained from hst and fuse spectra , @xmath14 within 10502020  @xcite , @xmath15 within 5001200  @xcite , @xmath16 within 6301155  @xcite , when comparing with the same values for longer wavelengths mentioned above . due to lower signal - to - noise ratio in the lyman series forests region detection of emission lines",
    "is more complicated here .",
    "for example , @xcite listed only three emission features between ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath17 ( 1025.72 ) with large uncertainties in the central wavelength .",
    "the other studies of composites and individual spectra have not enlarged significantly their number . in table  3",
    "we tried to summarise the known emission features , found in optical @xcite and uv @xcite composites , and in some individual spectra @xcite , within the range of @xmath18  ( between the ly@xmath17 and civ lines ) , used for studies in the present work .",
    "the spectral properties of quasars described above can be considered only as some generalised ones , because despite of general similarity in spectral shapes , they differ in spectral index ( also called spectral slope ) , intensity of continuum and emission lines , lines equivalent widths , etc . some of these parameters are found to have some dependence on each other , e.g. , the inverse correlation of equivalent width of some emission lines on monochromatic flux in uv region , known as the baldwin effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , compilation of composite spectra from subsamples with similar properties ( e.g. , with similar luminosity ) is of interest for studying these properties and there relation to other parameters .",
    "e.g. , @xcite studied the baldwin effect constructing composite spectra of quasar subsamples , chosen on the base of civ ( 1549 ) emission - line properties ( equivalent width and blueshift ) .",
    "they also found , that the mean blueshift of civ line is approximately twice larger for radio - quite quasars , than that of radio - loud ones .",
    "@xcite studied the spectral properties of broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars , compiling composites from subsamples with different ionization levels of bals , and found that there are substantial differences in the emission - line and continuum properties of high- and low - ionization bal quasars , which , in their opinion , can be related to intrinsic quasar properties such as the continuum spectral index . also using the composite spectra",
    ", @xcite studied the spectral properties of quasars depending on luminosity and redshift , and concluded that aside from the baldwin effect the average spectral properties are similar , e.g. the quasars with different luminosity have similar spectral index .    in the present paper",
    "we use the composite spectra compiled for subsamples of spectra with similar spectral index and study the possible effects , related to neglect of the difference in this parameter .",
    "the data used in this work , the sample selection and the composite spectra compilation processes are described in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the difference in redshift measurements made with the obtained composite spectra as templates compared to that with the sdss quasar template is studied in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] gives an estimation of errors introduced into the ly@xmath0 forest mean transmission measurement by neglect the difference in @xmath1 when using the composite spectra for such studies . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we present the results of our search for emission lines in our composites .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "our sample is taken from the public available release of the sky - residual subtracted spectra for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) legacy release 7 @xcite .",
    "this release ( ` wh sample ' hereafter ) , which is described in @xcite , contains a total of 106006 spectra , generated using the @xcite scheme from the spectra of the objects from the @xcite quasar catalogue .",
    "this scheme includes a significantly improved technique of the oh sky lines subtraction .",
    "the strong oh sky emission lines extend over almost half of the wavelength range ( @xmath19 ) of the sdss spectra and is not subtracted optimally enough with the previous sdss pipelines .",
    "the redshifts in sdss are measured mainly with the help of two techniques  emission line measurements and cross - correlation , or one of them .",
    "the errors of redshift ( due to intrinsic line shifts etc . )",
    "could affect the results of our study hence we tried to minimize their influence using the improved redshifts of the objects from the @xcite quasar catalogue , which was generated using the @xcite scheme , instead of redshifts in the headers of each fits - file .",
    "according to @xcite , their redshifts possess systematic biases , which are for a factor of 20 smaller compared to the sdss redshift values .",
    "all the quasar spectra ( 15154  objects ) from the hw sample with redshifts within the range 2.3@xmath204.6 and redshift determination confidence level @xmath21 were firstly selected . because the sdss is an automatic survey",
    "there is a possibility of pollution of the sample with ` wrong ' objects whose general photometry or spectroscopy properties required by the automatic selection pipelines are similar to the ones of ` real ' objects .",
    "thus a visual examination was carried out . except the non - quasar spectra the spectra of quasars with low signal - to - noise ratio , spectra of bal quasars and those with the damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) systems",
    "were also excluded during this examination .",
    "the presence of the bal quasars in the sample could introduce additional errors into an estimation of the quasar mean continuum level .",
    "the dla systems are a class of quasar absorbers selected for the presence of h  i column densities @xmath22  @xmath23 ( see e.g.  @xcite for review ) .",
    "they are identified as absorption features with the rest equivalent width exceeding 5 .",
    "the nature of these systems is still not understood , however due to their high density they are usually related to the galaxy formation and therefore could not be used as representatives of the linear perturbations in the neutral intergalactic medium .",
    "after the visual examination the sample contains 4779  spectra .",
    "redshift distributions of these objects and all the objects initially selected from hw sample are presented in figure  [ fig : zdistr ] ( _ dash - dot _ and _ dotted _ correspondingly ) .      generating composite spectra of quasars includes three steps : ( i ) normalization of each spectrum , ( ii ) setting each spectrum to the rest frame and ( iii ) calculation of the mean spectrum . before we smoothed all spectra with a simple moving average over 3 points .",
    "following @xcite we removed the following wavelength regions from our analysis because of calibration problems due to strong sky lines : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where the second region is 1  wider than that presented in @xcite , because we added also nai ( 5894.6 ) interstellar line to it .",
    "normalization of each spectrum is needed to be applied due to different apparent flux densities .",
    "taking into account the similarity of quasar spectra and following @xcite and @xcite we normalize each spectrum on the ( arithmetic ) mean flux in all pixels within the rest wavelength range 14501470 .",
    "this range lies blueward from the civ emission line and is usually considered to be free of obvious emission and absorption .",
    "the last claim appears to be not precise because of weak emission lines , which can be seen in composite spectra , but we neglect this fact , because intensity of these lines is comparable to noise level in individual spectra . for further study to reduce possible uncertainties we used only spectra with the rms of the normalization constant @xmath28 less than 15% ; the number of them is 3493 and its redshift distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : zdistr ] ( _ solid _ line ) .",
    "considering the continuum redward of ly@xmath0 emission line to be a power - law @xmath8 , we calculated its index @xmath1 for each individual spectrum within the range between ly@xmath0 and civ emission lines .",
    "for this purpose we selected the following wavelength ranges from the composite spectrum compiled from all the spectra : 1278@xmath201286 , 1320@xmath201326 , 1345@xmath201360  and 1440@xmath201480 .",
    "the distribution of the obtained indices is shown in figure  [ fig : alpha - distr ] .    using the obtained values of @xmath1 ,",
    "we selected 16 subsamples each of 200 spectra with @xmath1 closest to @xmath29 , @xmath30 . then dividing each @xmath31-th selected spectrum onto its normalization constant @xmath32 , rebinning them with @xmath33  and stacking the spectra into the rest frame , we obtained the mean arithmetic composite spectra .",
    "the dispersion @xmath34 of each pixel of the composite spectrum was calculated from the noises @xmath35 of pixels of individual spectra constituting it .",
    "these spectra within 10251650  are shown in figure  [ fig : all - spec ] .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the laboratory wavelengths of the lines identified by @xcite in this range .",
    "the first row of table  [ tab : samples ] contains the spectral indices of obtained composite spectra . in this case",
    "they were calculated in the way mentioned above , but the parts of the spectra which are the most free from emission lines were selected manually in each spectrum .",
    "the part of spectra used for @xmath1 determination is shown in figure  [ fig : lena ] .",
    "the regions selected for continuum fitting slightly vary from spectrum to spectrum and not all four parts used in calculation of indices of the individual spectra were taken into account in the case of composite spectra .",
    "this is clearly seen on example of the region with the shortest wavelengths : with the steepening of the spectrum its centre moves from @xmath36  to @xmath37 .",
    "it means that determination of the spectral index using the same regions as it was done for individual spectra is only an approximation , but it is sufficient for rough separation of spectra for compilation of composites .",
    "the second row of table  [ tab : samples ] contains the mean redshift of each subsample .",
    "it is seen , that the mean redshift slightly increases with @xmath1 , that might be an evidence for redshift evolution of the quasar spectral shape . on the other hand , the absence of such evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : z - slo ] for the whole sample of 3493 quasars means , that increase of the mean redshift for subsamples is probably a result of some selection effect .",
    ".the mean redshift @xmath38 and the mean monochromatic luminosity @xmath39 of subsamples and the spectral indices @xmath1 of their composites .",
    "the quoted error bars of @xmath39 and @xmath38 are the root mean squares for corresponding distributions .",
