    "we use the rigorously proved  @xcite effective potential approach developed independently of each other in refs .",
    "the effective potential approach is valid in the regime of low kinetic energies where the soliton is energetically forbidden to classically break apart , thus corresponding to a mean - field regime where reflection at a barrier leads to steps in the transmission coefficient  @xcite . in this energy regime",
    "both mesoscopic schrdinger - cat states  @xcite and , for two - component bose condensates , mesoscopic bell states  @xcite have been predicted theoretically to occur in the many - particle quantum dynamics of quantum matter - wave bright solitons . for a single - species , attractively interacting bose condensate and repulsive barrier ,",
    "the effective potential approach  @xcite is a powerful tool to model the many - particle quantum dynamics both for solitons of the order of @xmath0 atoms  @xcite but also for much smaller particle numbers of @xmath1  @xcite .",

    "in order to model attractively interacting atoms ( @xmath2 ) in one dimension , the integrable lieb - liniger-(mcguire ) hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath3 is available , where @xmath4 denotes the position of particle @xmath5 of mass @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite can be proved rigorously  @xcite .",
    "this parameter - regime coincides with a complete break - down of the validity of the gross - pitaevskii equationthe mean - field approach via the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe )  @xcite @xmath16 is a useful tool to explain ongoing state - of - the art experiments with matter - wave bright solitons like the experiments of refs .",
    "however , the mean - field approach fails in the quantum regime  @xcite that makes the quantum - enhanced interferometry proposed in the current paper possible . ] for describing scattering matter - wave solitons off , for example , a narrow barrier  @xcite .",
    "if the center - of - mass wave function is a delta function and the particle number is @xmath17 , then the single - particle density can be shown  @xcite to be equivalent to the mean - field result based on the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite ( cf .",

    "is shifted and a narrow _ repulsive _ scattering potential switched on at the new center of the trap .",
    "after the scattering potential is hit for the first time , schrdinger - cat states occur , after the second collision all particles are on the site opposite to the initial condition ( cf .",

    "[ fig : signature ] we compare what happens to a single atom ( @xmath33 ) to a @xmath0 quantum bright soliton : in the limit that the effective potential behaves similar to a delta - function , the length - scales are a factor of 10 smaller for the @xmath0 solitonfor ^7^li and @xmath34 , the set of parameters used is the slightly modified parameter set ( we doubled the strength of the radial trapping frequency ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the _ s_-wave scattering length  @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "in addition we chose @xmath37 .",
    "the intial distance from the trap center is chosen to be @xmath38 ; this can easily be reduced for bright solitons ( but not for single particles or weakly interacting bose - einstein condensates ) . for the soliton it corresponds to @xmath39 , within the regime of validity of the effective potential approach [ cf .",
    "eq.([eq : canevenbe ] ) ] . ] compared to @xmath33 . in passing we note that the signature demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : signature ] b ( and also in [ fig : quantum - enhanced ] b ) is not accessible on the mean - field ( gpe ) level as it involves intermediate schrdinger - cat statesin the energy regime in which the many - particle quantum mechanics predicts schrdinger - cat states , the gpe shows strong jumps  @xcite in the transmission behavior .",
    "when colliding with the scattering potential twice , the solitons are either reflected or transmitted in both cases . thus , the gpe - soliton ends on the same side as the initial condition ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and on the opposite side to the many - particle quantum prediction . ]",
    "as the soliton is not energetically allowed to break into smaller parts , thus what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signature].b for times @xmath40 corresponds to a quantum superposition of all particles being either on the left or right of the scattering potential .",
    "the main difference between the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : signature ] is that the upper panel is only for one particle .",
    "while one might choose to call this a schrdinger cat  @xcite , if describing a non - interacting bose - einstein condensate with @xmath19 particles in a rather classical product state , the following section shows that the state displayed in the upper panel lacks the many - particle entanglement properties necessary for quantum - enhanced interferometry for which the state displayed in the lower panel is particularly useful .",
    "in order for the signature displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : signature ] to work , the time - scale for decoherence events via , for example , single- or three- particle losses has to be large compared to the total time of the experiment from the first time the soliton hits the barrier to being detected at the site opposite to its initial condition .",
    "reference  @xcite shows a possible parameter set for ^7^li , using conservative estimates for the loss rates ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , thus justifying that using trapping frequencies in the direction of motion of the order of @xmath41 is indeed justified .",
    "for interferometric purposes , we define the `` classical '' accuracy as being the @xmath33 result , while `` quantum - enhanced '' refers to many - particle entangled states , in our case many - particle schrdinger - cat states .    as a practical example showing how much this improves the accuracy , we perform a thought measurement of a horizontal gradient in the gravitational potential , modeled as a linear potential added to eq .",
    "( [ eq : schreffective ] ) , @xmath42 which would lead to a shift of the zero of the harmonic trapping potential and thus to a non - vanishing distance @xmath43 between trap center and scattering potential .",
    "in order to estimate the accuracy of our interferometric measurement , we need to determine the position of a maximum by repeating the measurements @xmath44 times .",
    "the interference pattern as a function of @xmath45  namely the transmission coefficient after scattering at the potential twice  is given by  @xcite @xmath46\\\\    \\omega & = \\frac{nm\\omega x_0}{\\hbar}. \\label{eq : omega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to derive the last line , we used energy conservation to derive the center - of - mass momentum @xmath47 via @xmath48 together with the text - book  @xcite result that scattering a particle of mass @xmath49 with a plane wave with momentum @xmath47 from a delta function potential @xmath50 leads to fifty - fifty splitting if @xmath51 while the true effective potential will be broader than the delta - function used here , this only affects the amplitude , not the spatial period of the oscillations ( see fig .  3 from  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the delta - function approximation is sufficient for the purpose of estimating the accuracy of our interferometric setup .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) we find a distance between minima / maxima of @xmath52 while this seems to beat the @xmath33 case in accuracy by a factor of @xmath53 , comparing the @xmath19-particle bright soliton with an ideal bose - einstein condensate of @xmath19 particles leads , combined with the central limit theorem , to the fairer comparison that schrdinger cats beat non - interacting particles by a factor of @xmath54 in accuracy . at first glance ,",
    "[ fig : quantum - enhanced ] seems to demonstrate an improvement in accuracy @xmath55 in measuring the position of the maximum by a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "however , we should not compare measuring a single soliton with measuring a single particle .",
    "we need to repeat the soliton experiments @xmath44 times to determine the position of the maximum , each time measuring @xmath19 particles , thus we use the central - limit theorem to compare this to measuring @xmath56 noninteracting particles to gain a factor of @xmath54 , @xmath57    ( color online ) our signature that everything is on the side opposite to the initial condition after colliding with the barrier twice as a function of distance between trap minimum and scattering potential [ see .",
    "[ fig : signature ] also for parameters used ] for ( a ) a single particle and ( b ) a quantum bright soliton of @xmath0 particles [ eq .  ( [ eq : t ] ) ] .",
    "the spatial period is smaller by a factor of @xmath0 for the soliton which corresponds to a gain in accuracy of @xmath54 . ]    thus , our thought experiment can measure differences in the gravitational acceleration of at least @xmath58 which yields a difference in acceleration of @xmath59 this yields a difference in the acceleration potential of @xmath60 which takes into account the fact that we effectively average @xmath61 over a distance @xmath62 .",
    "thus , within the definition  ( [ eq : accuracy ] ) , the accuracy is independent of our choice of @xmath26 .",
    "the strength of quantum bright solitons lies in particular in the fact that one can get much closer to the scattering potential than for non - interacting particles , thus exploring shorter length - scales .    for ^7^li , @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , footnote  [ footnote : parameters ] ) and @xmath63 , if our thought experiment involves measuring @xmath44 solitons , it can detect differences smaller than @xmath64 . by replacing ^7^li by ^85^rb",
    "we could gain another order of magnitude in accuracy .",
    "while at first glance it might appear to be tempting to propose to both further reduce the trapping frequency and further increase the particle number , the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : accuracy ] ) relies on the occurence of intermediate schrdinger - cat states and thus will work better for not too large particle numbers and not too long time - scales .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the potential differences we intend to measure on micrometer scale ( gravity was just an example ) , the accuracy might actually be too large to easily determine the distance of the scattering potential from the trap center . to work out a clever way to start with reduced accuracy ( with non - interacting atoms and/or higher trapping frequencies ) in order to roughly determine the position and to continuously increase the accuracy could still be an engineering challenge .",
    "nevertheless , our results clearly indicate the feasibility of such a device .",
    "similar to the case of the spin - squeezed states realized in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrating interferometric accuracy surpassing what is possible classically , schrdinger - cat states can also be used for quantum - enhanced measurements  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose to use small , harmonically trapped quantum matter - wave bright solitons for quantum - enhanced measurements .",
    "the signature we propose to measure  the probability to find all particles at the side opposite to the initial condition  is not accessible on the mean - field ( gpe ) level as it involves intermediate schrdinger - cat states ( see footnote  [ foonote : notgpe ] ) . when shifting the position of the scattering potential away from the center , our signature oscillates .",
    "the spatial oscillation period scales @xmath65 with the number of particles , thus providing the `` usual '' increase in accuracy by a factor of @xmath54 quantum - enhanced measurements can provide . here ,",
    "it occurs when the position of the maximum is determined via repeated measurements .",
    "a potential experimental realization of such a setup might be useful to measure small horizontal gradients in the gravitational force on micrometer scales in an approach complementary to existing experiments combining bose - einstein condensates and gravity  @xcite .",
