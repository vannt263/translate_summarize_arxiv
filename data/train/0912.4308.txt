    "quasar absorption lines are an important tracer of the gas in and around galaxies , and in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "many important diagnostic lines lie in the far - ultraviolet , however , so that studies of low redshift absorbers require such observations .",
    "the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) @xcite have provided high resolution uv spectra along many lines of sight , covering multiple transitions for many low redshift absorption systems . having access to transitions with a range of ionization states allows us to study gas with a wide range of densities ( @xmath12@xmath13  @xmath4 ) in order to probe a large fraction of the volume of the universe .    on the high density end of the scale , the damped absorbers ( with @xmath14  @xmath15 )",
    "produce strong , saturated absorption in many neutral and singly ionized species .",
    "they are associated with the densest regions in a variety of structures at low redshift , including regions in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies as well as in luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "most of the cross section of luminous galaxies gives rise to lyman limit ( @xmath16 ) and strong  absorption @xcite .",
    "those  absorbers with @xmath17 are collectively called the  forest ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these are responsible for @xmath18% of the baryonic content of the universe @xcite at low redshift , down from @xmath19% at @xmath20 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most of the  forest clouds have @xmath21 and many are expected to be diffuse ( overdensities @xmath22 of order 5 ) and photoionized @xcite .",
    "other populations of absorbers also exist , associated with galaxy haloes and environments , that are denser and with different sources of ionization @xcite , including , , and weak  absorbers .",
    "these are important because they trace regions of emerging structure formation where processes like interactions and feedback shape the properties of intergalactic gas .",
    "another important species is , a possible tracer of the shock - heated warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , which would generally have temperatures of @xmath23 to @xmath24 @xcite and overdensities of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "if collisionally ionized ,  lines would trace gas at @xmath26 , particularly near @xmath27 .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "simulations predict that the whim density would be @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "other simulations done by @xcite suggest the presence of a whim component with temperatures of less than @xmath23 . this component would be shock - heated and would be arranged into sheets @xcite .",
    "most of it would have @xmath29 .",
    "the cooler whim would comprise @xmath30 of the baryons @xcite .",
    "searching for the whim has become a key issue in accounting for local baryons , and  is an important tracer ; however the origin of  absorbers is likely to be varied , with some likely to be cooler and photoionized , but with some  absorbers also consistent with higher temperature , collisionally ionized gas and/or with multiphase conditions ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; * ? ? ?",

    "specifically , @xcite have analysed a sample of 51 @xmath31 intervening  absorbers , with a particular emphasis on a comparison between the  and the  absorption .",
    "the majority of  absorbers with aligned  and   components tend to be relatively cool ( @xmath32  k ) , and consistent with photoionized gas and not with collisional ionization .",
    "however , roughly half of the  absorbers also have evidence for multiple phases , with the possibility of a hotter , collisional component in addition to the cooler one .",
    "other diagnostics have been proposed for gauging the whim density , such as broad lyman absorption @xcite , and other transitions like , , and  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have found that  absorbers with @xmath33 are identified with haloes of bright galaxies , extending to @xmath34 , with a covering factor of nearly unity .",
    "they proposed that these  haloes were formed from debris stripped from satellite galaxies .",
    "roughly half of these  systems at low redshift also have weak  detected , which is typically housed in a thinner , higher density layer ( @xmath35  @xmath4 ) within the lower density , higher ionization region that gives rise to the  @xcite .",
    "a survey of weak  absorbers , using  and  as representative tracers , found @xmath36 for weak  absorbers with @xmath37   at @xmath38 .",
    "thus these absorbers are only a small fraction of  absorbers .",
    "weak  absorbers at @xmath39 have typical metallicities @xmath40  solar and even greater than solar in many cases , despite their location far from the luminous part of bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "they have been proposed to arise in extragalactic analogs of milky way high velocity clouds , in superwind structures , and generally in metal - rich regions in the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is overlap between the different classes of absorbers , especially in view of phase structure ( gas with two different densities at similar velocity ) being common .",
    "however , there is a clear progression with , , and  tracing progressively lower density photoionized gas ( @xmath41  @xmath42@xmath4 ) , but with  also sometimes arising in collisionally ionized gas at higher temperature .",
    "thus dense structures give rise to low ionization gas and diffuse structures to highly ionized gas , providing a convenient way to map the distribution of gas in and around galaxies .",
    "an important complication to this picture occurs due to the evolving extragalactic background radiation incident on these systems . for gas at the same density , the ionization parameter , @xmath43 , decreases by about an order of magnitude from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , leading to less ionized structures in the present than in the past .",
    "for example , @xcite found that clouds that produced  absorption and no detected  ( @xmath46 ) at @xmath47 would produce weak , but detectable  absorption at @xmath48 .",
    "thus the fundamental nature of the population of absorbers for a given line has changed with time , even if the density distribution of structures does not change .    at low redshift ,  977 provides an important diagnostic of the physical conditions of gas since it is such an intrinsically strong line for gas with an intermediate ionization state , i.e. for @xmath49 @xcite , or an intermediate temperature , i.e. for @xmath50 @xcite .",

    "@xcite argue that the large range of @xmath57 , and the correlation of @xmath58 with @xmath59 imply two phases in many  absorption systems .",
    "their model involves a ` warm neutral medium ' ( wnm ) core with @xmath60 , which would often produce  absorption , and a whim sheath giving rise to  absorption @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 absorber along the line of sight towards the quasar phl  1811 @xcite is a  absorber in which  and  are only weakly detected , thus we expect it has an intermediate ionization state .",
    "similar systems include the @xmath61 system towards pg 1116 + 215 @xcite and the @xmath62 system towards pg 1634 + 706 that we have identified in archival _ hst_/stis and keck / hires spectra of that quasar . in this paper",
    ", we aim to constrain the physical conditions of the phl  1811  absorber , using the excellent coverage of many metal line transitions and of the lyman series lines , with _ hst_/stis and fuse .",
    "this system was among the 51 intervening  absorbers studied by @xcite , who found three components of absorption with differing ionization states offset by @xmath18  @xmath1 , but did not consider it specifically in great detail . in this paper , for the @xmath0 system toward phl  1811 , we perform cloudy @xcite photoionization modelling and consider whether collisional or photoionization is more likely .",
    "we compare the density , temperature , and metallicity to those of weak , , and  absorbers at low and intermediate redshift in order to see how dominant  systems fit in .",
    "we then consider information from the @xcite imaging of the field and discuss which part of the galactic environments and intergalactic medium this system and other systems like it might be probing .",
    "the data reduction and modelling methods are covered in   [ sec : methods ] . in section   [ sec : spectrum ] we present the relevant metal line transitions and lyman series lines used to constrain the properties of the @xmath0 system towards phl  1811 .",

    "the implications for the origin and environment of the @xmath0 system towards phl  1811 and other similar systems are discussed in   [",
    "sec : discussion ] .",
    "we reduced the phl 1811 spectra from both stis and fuse .",
    "phl  1811 was observed with the e140 m grating of stis ( @xmath63 aperture ) for a total of 18.4  ks in program 9418 ( pi jenkins ; @xcite ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 11501730   .",
    "our stis data reduction is described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the @xmath64 e140 m data were downloaded , and the pipeline was run on the data @xcite . because of the low @xmath65 of individual exposures , the averaging of exposures was a simple weighting by exposure times , as in @xcite .",
    ".fuse observations used . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     for comparison , the mean baryonic number density of the universe is @xmath66 .",
    "these cooling times assume that the ionization is from collisional ionization only ; at high @xmath67 ( low density ) , photoionization can keep the cloud in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we find that @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for @xmath70 .",
    "collisionally ionized clouds are dense , so they will necessarily have very short cooling times : a few million years or less .",
    "the constraints are more severe for cloud b than cloud a , but they are the same order of magnitude for both . even at @xmath71 , approaching the photoionization regime , @xmath72 , vastly shorter than time - scales of large scale structure formation .",
    "only when the density is comparable to the critical density of the universe ( @xmath73 ) are the cooling times comparable to the hubble time .",
    "another reason that we prefer a photoionization explanation of the system is the detected  absorption in cloud a  and  absorption in cloud b. photoionization models could explain the presence of these species , but our collisionally ionized models could not account for all the observed absorption without overproducing .",
    "however , it is possible that the system contains otherwise hidden phases that would produce this absorption .",
    "furthermore , as we discussed in ",
    "[ sec : acolion ] and   [ sec : bcolion ] , it is possible that our grids were too coarse to find collisional ionization solutions . while we argued against this possibility for cloud a , because of the  and  absorption , it remains a possibility for the  absorption of cloud b.    based on these arguments , we conclude that photoionization works better as the source of ionization for these clouds than collisional ionization , especially for cloud a. the system is not likely to be part of the whim , whether cool or warm . that still leaves the question of which photoionized phase of the igm the absorber is a part of .",
    "is each component part of the low density  forest , a high density cloud associated with a galaxy , or even a transitional state with a density normally associated with the whim ? from the densities given in table  [ table:2photphys ] , it is clear that both clouds are relatively high density . with a number density of @xmath74 ( overdensity @xmath75 ) in our preferred model , cloud a is far too dense to be a part of the  forest or any photoionized whim .",
    "therefore , it is probably ` condensed ' and associated with some galaxy @xcite .",
    "cloud b is still far too dense to be a part of the  forest , with @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) in our favoured model , it is fairly dense for the whim , and an order of magnitude denser than typical cool whim gas .",
    "however , cloud b is also underdense for a typical condensed  absorber ( @xmath78 ) in the models of @xcite . because it is probably photoionized and relatively cold ( @xmath79 )",
    ", it does not cleanly fall into either the whim phase or the condensed phase .",
    "if it is primordial , it may represent some kind of transitional absorber .",
    "this may also be seen from its larger size ( about @xmath80 ) . if cloud b is collisionally ionized , it will be denser , and more clearly associated with an individual galaxy .",
    "this discussion assumes that the absorbers are primordial , in that the gas has not been processed by a galaxy and returned to the igm , but is still undergoing structure formation .",
    "however , it is also possible that low density gas has been ejected out of a galaxy , perhaps as a wind or as tidal debris .",
    "then , cloud b may still be associated with a galaxy , even with its low density , and however it is ionized . since cloud b can not be clearly identified with the usual igm phases , a galactic origin of this kind may be preferred .",
    "the possibility of an origin from within a galaxy will be considered more in   [ sec : association ] .",
    "when they identified the @xmath81 absorber along the phl 1811 line of sight , @xcite proposed that it was a tidal debris cloud .",
    "they noted the existence of absorption systems on this sight line at @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "these are fairly close in redshift to the nearby galaxy g 158 , at @xmath86 .",
    "that galaxy lies at a projected distance of @xmath87 from the sightline @xcite .",
    "another galaxy , g 169 , is at @xmath88 with impact parameter @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "a follow - up acs image revealed a third bright galaxy coincident with the quasar , probably the quasar host , though it is remotely possible that it lies at another redshift @xcite .",
    "because of the relatively few metal lines visible in these systems , they initially proposed that all the clouds are linked with the galaxy g158 and are the result of tidal debris @xcite .",
    "galaxy interactions are known to produce large tidal tails of gas and stars , stripped off from the interacting galaxies .",
    "neutral hydrogen is among the constituents of these tails .",
    "famous among tidal tails is the magellanic stream , which has a velocity gradient of up to @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "other examples include ngc 4676a and b , with a  velocity amplitude of @xmath91 ; and arp 295 a and b , with a  velocity amplitude reaching @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "column densities of  can be up to @xmath93 in tidal tails , with total  masses of @xmath94 .",
    "spatially , they may extend 100 @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the velocity difference for the @xmath81 system is still rather large , with @xmath96 to g 158 and @xmath97 to g 169 @xcite .",
    "these large velocities could be problematic for the tidal debris scenario , as stated by @xcite .",
    "another , less dramatic scenario is that the @xmath81 system towards phl 1811 is associated with the local large scale structure .",
    "there are a number of galaxies at nearly the same redshift .",
    "one of the nearest is sdss j215513.70 - 091805.8 at @xmath98 , which is 5.3 away from phl 1811 @xcite , implying an impact parameter of @xmath99 .",
    "several other galaxies cluster at this redshift , including several at @xmath100 .",
    "@xcite investigated the large scale structure at @xmath101 on the phl 1811 sightline .",
    "the supercluster aquarius b is in its direction at the same redshift @xcite .",
    "@xcite list five clusters in aquarius b with @xmath102 .",
    "they note that the phl 1811 sightline passes between two pairs of these clusters : a2376 and a2377 , as well as a2402 and a2410 @xcite . however , the phl 1811 sightline does not pass near any of the clusters themselves , coming only within 50 @xcite .",
    "therefore , absorbers on the phl 1811 sightline could be in cosmic filaments connecting the clusters , but not the clusters themselves .",
    "@xcite note that the velocity dispersions of the @xmath103 absorbers , up to 2250 @xmath1  for the @xmath104 absorber , could arise from motions in superclusters .",
    "sdss data does not cover phl 1811 , but does extend to near regions in the sky . from that sdss data , @xcite found that there is a filament of galaxies near phl 1811 s sightline that includes two s0 galaxies at @xmath105 .",
    "several studies have found that while strong  absorbers @xcite and  absorbers @xcite may be associated with galaxies , weak  absorbers do not cluster as much . according to @xcite ,",
    "a third to two - thirds of all strong  absorbers are within galaxies .",
    "they also found an inverse relationship between the impact parameter and the equivalent width of the  line @xcite .",
    "however , their study focused on strong  absorbers .",
    "furthermore , they did not find a relationship between equivalent width and type of galaxy , which is what would be expected if galaxies were responsible @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the majority of weak ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) absorbers have no bright galaxy within @xmath108 .",
    "instead , they appear to fall along filaments connecting the galaxies @xcite . clouds like these are reported in cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "perhaps the system at @xmath81 towards phl 1811 is part of the large scale structure linking the aquarius b supercluster , including groups at @xmath100 and the one containing g 158 .",
    "the projected distance between sdss j215513.70 - 091805.8 and the phl 1811 line of sight is nearly the median projected distance between galaxies and  absorbers , @xmath109 ( @xmath110 @xcite . if the phl 1811 @xmath81 system is part of a supercluster filament , its redshift near those of sdss j215513.70 - 091805.8 and g 158 may be explained .",
    "we should note , however , that the system at @xmath81 towards phl 1811 is a relatively strong  absorber .",
    "in fact , the implied overdensity would be far greater than that typical of a large scale structure associated  absorber ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "rather , the temperature and density are more like that of the ` condensed ' galactic  clouds , especially for cloud a ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cloud b , with a lower overdensity , may indeed be associated with structure on the hundred kiloparsec scale in some way .",
    "a final possibility to consider is that the system at @xmath81 on the phl 1811 line of sight is associated with a dwarf galaxy too faint to see .",
    "the dwarf , of course , may be located within a filament of galaxies in the large scale structure .",
    "this could reconcile the high density of phl 1811 @xmath81 with the lack of an observed galaxy .",
    "such a dwarf might even be in the same group as g 158 or g 169 .",
    "@xcite proposed that ` vanishing ' dwarf galaxies are responsible for  absorption .",
    "the dwarfs would form late in cosmic history .",
    "an initial burst of star formation will result in supernovae , creating winds that clear out the galaxy centres .",
    "this terminates star formation . as a result ,",
    "the galaxy glows only with residual starlight .",
    "however , an outer halo of neutral gas , enriched with metals , remains @xcite .",
    "at least one absorber , with similar properties to the @xmath81 system towards phl 1811 , is likely to be associated with a dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite found an impact parameter of @xmath112 between the system at @xmath113 towards 3c 273 and a dwarf galaxy at approximately the same @xmath114 .",
    "the dwarf galaxy has magnitude @xmath115 , and metallicity @xmath116 , compared to @xmath117 for the absorber , derived along the absorber sightline @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81 system towards phl 1811 is consistent with a similar metallicity of @xmath118 . at @xmath81 , and assuming @xmath119 = 0.7 , @xmath120 = 0.3 , and @xmath121 , the distance modulus would be @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , if the host galaxy for phl 1811 z = 0.0777 was similar to the dwarf galaxy described in @xcite , it would appear at magnitude @xmath123 .",
    "it would thus be well below the magnitude limit of @xmath124 in the @xcite initial survey , and would not have been detected .",
    "if the system at @xmath81 towards phl 1811 is a condensed structure associated with a galaxy , it is likely to be related to other classes of absorbers in galactic environments .",
    "a common tracer of denser gas in galactic haloes is .",
    "if it is in a less dense phase , galactic halo gas appears as  absorption .",
    "finally , at very low densities , the gas shows up as  absorption lines .",
    "other lines may be used to discern the same phases ; for example ,  and  for cooler gas , and  for hotter gas .",
    "the exact temperature and densities highlighted by each line depends on the photoionizing background , which in turn depends on the redshift .",
    "absorption in  would trace intermediate phase gas , with physical conditions between gas probed by  lines and gas probed by  lines .",
    "however , the @xmath81 system towards phl 1811 has two distinct components , with different inferred physical conditions .",
    "could either of these clouds be identified with known phases in galactic haloes ?",
    "the low redshift igm is not as well studied as the high redshift igm , because many of the important lines lie in the far ultraviolet .",
    "most low redshift studies concentrate on the overall statistics of absorbers , in particular , their number distribution and the fraction of the igm they comprise . none the less ,",
    "some studies have considered which igm phase is representative of each ion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that cloud a is a member of a small subset of the  absorbers studied by @xcite .",
    "this is evident simply based on the number of absorbers with detected weak and absorption ( @xmath36 for @xmath126   ; @xcite ) relative to ( @xmath127 for @xmath128   ; @xcite ) .",
    "this subset is characterised by higher densities compared to the typical photoionized clouds described by @xcite , i.e. a lower ionization parameter .",
    "the typical ionization parameter for photoionized  clouds is in the range @xmath129 and we have found cloud a to be at the very lower end of this range to explain the observed  absorption .",
    "our favoured cloudy photoionized cloud models predict a  rest frame equivalent width of @xmath130   for cloud a ( @xmath131 ) and a negligible value for the more highly ionized cloud b ( @xmath132 ) . a value of @xmath133   would have been detected at high spectral resolution if the data had covered that spectral range . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "only some of the e230 m spectra in the stis archive had high @xmath65 data for wavelengths 2800  3110  so that a total of @xmath134 weak  absorbers might be expected in the small total path length . because of this , direct knowledge of weak  absorbers at low redshift is limited . in the case of this @xmath0 absorber , the only spectrum covering the relevant near - uv region",
    "was obtained with the stis g230l grating @xcite and does not have a resolution sufficient for detection of a weak  line . however , the  1260 and  1335 equivalent widths of the absorber imply that cloud a is the equivalent of a weak  absorber @xcite .",
    "so , this subclass of  systems may largely coincide with the class of weak  systems at @xmath48 .",
    "although cloud b does not have low ionization absorption , it is detected in  and can be compared to  absorbers . @xcite studied very low redshift ( @xmath135 )  absorbers that were slightly stronger than cloud b ( @xmath136 compared to @xmath137 for cloud b ) .",
    "they found that there was little correlation between @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "they interpreted this to mean that  and  arise in different phases .",
    "furthermore , there was some correlation between @xmath139 and @xmath140 , suggesting that @xmath141 was collisionally ionized , or at least of the same phase as .",
    "interestingly , there does seem to be  absorption associated with cloud b , with an equivalent width of @xmath142 according to our voigt profile fits (   [ sec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "this detection was confirmed by @xcite in their study of low-@xmath114  absorption .",
    "our more detailed modelling of the system suggests that it is photoionized , though not necessarily associated with an individual galaxy ( see   [ sec : discussioncolion ] ) .",
    "while  absorbers may be collisionally ionized , some may be photoionized ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that @xcite discovered @xmath143 haloes in low redshift galaxies that appeared as  absorption . in their picture , galaxies have haloes that become more rarefied and ionized with increasing radius .",
    "so , the inner regions of galactic haloes would contain high density absorbers , such as those associated with , while the outer regions of would produce .",
    "the inferred size of cloud b ( @xmath144 ) in our favoured photoionized model , is of the same order as their extended haloes .",
    "since the density of cloud a already suggests that it is associated with a galaxy , the @xcite scenario would present a unified framework for interpreting the system : cloud a is an overdensity in the inner halo of a galaxy , contained in cloud b , the outer halo .",
    "however , the @xcite study was for @xmath145 galaxies , which should have been detected if present . for this scenario to apply , the galaxy involved would have to be of lower luminosity .    in short ,",
    "for this system ,  coincides with both  and  phases .",
    "however , neither cloud a nor cloud b seem to be completely typical  absorbers in the @xcite samples . instead , typical  absorbers would have conditions intermediate between cloud a and cloud b. this implies that  actually traces several distinct phases of the igm , and  absorbers are not a homogeneous population in terms of underlying physical conditions .",
    "more information about galactic absorbers and their physical conditions is available at higher redshift , because the lines are redshifted into more convenient wavelengths . since the photoionizing background changes with redshift , becoming more intense at high @xmath114",
    ", we should not expect that the system would look the same at @xmath11 . to compare the system at @xmath81 towards phl 1811 with @xmath11 systems ,",
    "we used cloudy to produce a simulated spectrum at @xmath146 given the same physical conditions .",
    "we used our favoured model ( @xmath147 and @xmath148 for cloud a and @xmath149 and @xmath148 for cloud b ) at @xmath81 as the baseline .",
    "density , size , metallicity , and abundance were kept the same . however , the cloud was subject to the @xmath44 haardt & madau spectrum , so that both the resulting ionization parameter and background ionizing spectrum were different .",

    "the  absorption remains , but has grown weaker .",
    "similarly , the higher order lyman series lines are also weaker .",
    "there is also some very weak  absorption .",
    "however , the  absorption has disappeared entirely . at @xmath11 , then , cloud a does not display low ionization lines but remains a  absorber .",
    "cloud b , the less dense component , is only weakly detected , and only in  and  absorption .",
    "the  absorption has about the same strength as at @xmath81 , but the  line has nearly vanished ( compare with fig .  [",
    "fig : s4s6 ] ) , because more of the hydrogen has been ionized .",
    "according to our simulated spectrum ,  absorption would still come from the same phase as the denser  clouds at @xmath125 , those like cloud a. however , at high redshift , higher ionization clouds like cloud b would cease displaying . not only does  appear to come from several different phases at low redshift , but the set of phases it traces changes with redshift .",
    "this will complicate studies of  that span a large range in @xmath114 .",
    "systems with similar spectral features are known to be associated with galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "again ,  and  are commonly used tracers of highly ionized and moderately ionized gas . cloud a , with a predicted radius of hundreds of parsecs , and a predicted density of @xmath151 , is comparable to the inferred sizes and densities of @xmath11 high ionization  clouds",
    ". furthermore , at @xmath11 , while high ionization clouds do occur without low ionization clouds at the same velocity , the converse is rarely true @xcite .",
    "clouds with the same physical conditions as these @xmath11 are expected to manifest as , , and  absorption at low redshift @xcite .",
    "indeed , cloud a does show  absorption at low redshift , just as  absorbers at @xmath11 are expected to .",
    "there are clear differences between this system and typical single cloud weak  absorbers at @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath11 absorbers are often found , with photoionization modelling , to have smaller sizes and higher densities than any of the clouds in the @xmath81 system towards phl 1811 .",
    "@xcite constrained the iron - rich weak  absorbers to have low ionization parameters , high density ( @xmath152 ) , and thicknesses of only @xmath153 pc @xcite .",
    "those absorbers with little iron , like the @xmath81 absorber towards phl 1811 , were less well constrained , with sizes that could be larger than 10 pc and densities that could be lower than 0.1 @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite inferred depths of 0.1 to 100 pc , with average densities near 0.01 @xmath4 . in comparison ,",
    "the predicted density of @xmath151 for our favoured model for cloud a is quite small , and its size of @xmath154  pc is large . based on the inferred physical conditions of cloud a and its predicted absorption at @xmath11 , we expect that cloud a would have been a  absorber at those times , possibly of the same kind that envelops  absorbers at that redshift .",
    "however , it would not have been a weak  absorber at @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite , however , note a problem with  phases at @xmath146 becoming lower ionization phases at @xmath155 .",
    "because @xmath156 increases with time for a given system , more weak  absorbers would be expected to be detectable at present .",
    "their survey of  analogs , based on  and  lines , suggests that @xmath157 for weak  absorbers at @xmath155 .",
    "this implies that they are more rare in the present than in the past . since",
    "high ionization phases are expected to contribute more @xmath125  absorbers than low ionization phases , this suggests that the objects producing the  phases seen at @xmath146 are evolving away by @xmath125 .",
    "this could be because weak  absorbers may be persistent but shedding their high ionization material with time , or because the high ionization phases are transient and are being regenerated less often in the present .",
    "however , our modelling of the system at @xmath81 towards phl 1811 suggests that at least a few of these high ionization clouds survive to ( or continue to be formed in ) the present .",
    "on the other hand , if cloud a corresponds to the high ionization phase found in weak  systems , then what is cloud b ?",
    "cloud b appears to be still larger , less dense , and even higher ionization .",
    "it seems to be another phase beyond those considered by @xcite , enshrouding the  components . at high redshift",
    ", this phase may be visible in  or .",
    "it may be some kind of photoionized whim in which cloud a and any host galaxy is embedded , as discussed in  [ sec : discussioncolion ] .",
    "this scenario is consistent with photoionization modelling done by @xcite on the system at @xmath158 on the pg 1634 + 706 line of sight .",
    "that system is a ` multicloud weak  absorber ' , with low ionization  clouds , intermediate ionization  clouds , higher ionization  clouds , and still higher ionization broad  components @xcite",
    ". if the  components at the same velocity as the  components are from a separate phase , then the  clouds are best fit with sizes of several kiloparsecs , resembling cloud a @xcite .",
    "however , the broad  and  absorption in that system is fit by clouds with sizes of 12 @xmath95  and 257 @xmath95 , comparable to our predictions for cloud b @xcite .",
    "our ( @xmath132 , @xmath159 ) model produces the small detected  absorption feature from cloud b. compared with cloud b , the  absorption is stronger in @xcite with @xmath160 being a factor of @xmath161 times greater for each of their  clouds , because those clouds had greater total column density , as well as higher metallicity or ionization parameter @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied a pair of sightlines that pass through the virgo cluster , 3c 273 and rx j1230.8 + 0115 .",
    "they found several  absorbers at the redshift of the virgo cluster , with ionization parameters of @xmath162 , conditions similar to those for weak  absorbers , and detected weak  and   absorption @xcite .",
    "photoionization modelling implied sizes of a few tens of kiloparsecs @xcite .",
    "none the less , absorbers were found to be ` correlated ' between the sightlines , though the separation was nearly @xmath163 @xcite . @xcite were sceptical that the absorbers were part of ` contiguous ' filaments , because of velocity dispersions within the virgo cluster and because the absorbers on the two sightlines were not identical .",
    "they also found that only one of the absorbers , the v = 1589 @xmath1  system towards 3c 273 , could be associated with a galaxy @xcite .",
    "so , they suggested a scenario in which the absorbers were part of different overdensities in the same large scale structure .",
    "the overdensities could be from dwarf winds , though this explanation requires a large amount of initial  gas in the dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this appears to be a similar situation to the @xmath81 system on the phl 1811 sightline , which is embedded in known large scale structure filaments , near several galaxy clusters , but has no identifiable host .    when considering single cloud weak  absorption systems at @xmath164 , @xcite use a statistical argument to show that the high ionization  phases are identified with the @xmath34  ( @xmath165 haloes seen around bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "our favoured model of the system at @xmath81 on the phl 1811 sightline argues against this conjecture , at least as applied to @xmath146  absorbers .",
    "cloud a seems to be a descendant of the high ionization phase surrounding weak  absorbers seen at @xmath11 , corresponding to  clouds with sizes of order a half a @xmath95 . on the other hand ,",
    "cloud b is probably a  cloud ( at @xmath125 ) with a size of tens of @xmath95 , similar to the size of the  haloes inferred by @xcite .",
    "cloud b , therefore , itself seems to be reminiscent of the  haloes described in @xcite  yet , at @xmath11 with more intense ionizing radiation it would be an  absorber .",
    "so , the higher ionization  phases seen in weak  absorbers at high redshift , which are similar to cloud a , may not be the  haloes at low redshift , which are similar to cloud b. instead , the  absorbers seen at @xmath11 ( similar to cloud a ) may be overdensities in relatively spherical haloes ( including cloud b ) .",
    "alternatively , the large  haloes may be large scale structure associated with the host galaxies of more compact absorbers , like cloud a , or denser , filamentary  absorbers at @xmath11 .",
    "we have modelled the @xmath81  absorption system towards phl  1811 in order to derive its physical conditions and to compare to other classes of absorbers .",
    "we find the system to be best fit by two photoionized  clouds , separated by @xmath166  @xmath1 , with @xmath70 : cloud a , with @xmath167 , which also gives rise to  and weak  absorption , and cloud b , with @xmath168 , which also gives rise to weak  and  absorption ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : s4s6 ] ) .",
    "these parameters are constrained to within @xmath169  dex .",
    "photoionization models explain these two clouds better than collisional ionization models , both because they can simultaneously produce all observed metal line transitions and because collisional ionization models have very short cooling times .    for our favoured model ,",
    "cloud a has a density of @xmath170  @xmath4 and a thickness of @xmath5  kpc .",
    "if we had coverage of the appropriate wavelength range , we would expect to observe weak  absorption from this cloud , with @xmath171 .",
    "we predict with a photoionization model ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : z1spectrum ] ) that , had it existed at @xmath11 , cloud a would have appeared as , , and  absorption , while cloud b would have been an  absorber . despite its identity as a weak , low ionization absorber at low redshift , cloud",
    "a has a lower density and large size than the large population of weak low ionization absorbers studied at @xmath39 through  absorption . the cloud a properties are similar to those of  absorbers ( without detected low ionization ) at @xmath39 , but the decreased extragalactic background radiation at low redshift leads to a shift towards a lower ionization state .",
    "cloud b has a density of @xmath172  @xmath4 and a thickness of @xmath7  kpc , suggesting that it may be analogous to  absorbers at @xmath11 .",
    "physically , we suggest that the two  clouds  in this absorber are significantly condensed regions , with cloud a ( overdensity @xmath75 to within a factor of @xmath173 ) in some way related to a galaxy environment , and with cloud b ( overdensity @xmath77 to within a factor of @xmath173 ) embedded in the large scale structure .",
    "the two clouds are different phases of the igm .",
    "neither seems typical of  absorbers : cloud a shows the rarer , while cloud b shows  and , which @xcite argues is from a different igm phase than .",
    "we conclude that  absorbers in general represent several igm phases , including the two phases of our system .",
