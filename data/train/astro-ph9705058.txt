    "the x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies enables direct probing of gravitationally bound and virialized regions with virial radii @xmath4 of a few mpcs , comprising total masses @xmath5 mostly in dark matter ( dm hereafter ) .    on the one hand ,",
    "the x - ray temperature @xmath6 measures the depth of the potential wells . on the other hand , the bolometric luminosity @xmath7 emitted as thermal bremsstrahlung by the intracluster plasma measures the baryon number density @xmath8 within the volume @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath3 relation constitutes a crucial _ link _ between the physics of the baryon component and the dynamical properties of the dm condensations .    the simplest model describing the former holds @xmath8 to be proportional to the average dm density @xmath10 , and @xmath11 to @xmath4 , so that @xmath12 obtains ( self - similar model , hereafter ss , kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "if so , the luminosity would scale as @xmath13 , which is inconsistent with the observed correlation close to @xmath14 ( edge & stewart 1991 ; mushotzky 1994 ; tsuru et al .",
    "1996 ) . further steepening at the temperatures of galaxy groups is indicated for the emission not associated with single galaxies ( ponman et al .",
    "in addition , the ss model when combined with the standard hierarchical cosmogony ( see peebles 1993 ) yields for the clusters a local x - ray luminosity function too steep or too high compared with the data ( evrard & henry 1991 ; oukbir , bartlett & blanchard 1996 ) .",
    "so the indication is that the ratio @xmath15 is to depend on @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "it will be convenient to write the volume  averaged @xmath18 in terms of two factors : the compression factor @xmath19 , describing the gas overdensity relative to the outer value at the `` boundary '' , taken here to be at @xmath4 as discussed in  3 ; and the inner shape factor @xmath20 , with the main contribution coming from inside @xmath11 .",
    "the result is : @xmath21 where the last term follows from expressing @xmath4 from @xmath22 . to obtain the _ average _ @xmath3 relation to be compared with data , the factor @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) has to be averaged over the cluster histories , as we carry out in  2.3 .",
    "so , the difference of eq .",
    "( 1 ) from the ss model has been factored out into the terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are determined by the hydro- and thermodynamics of the gas in the forming cluster wells . at @xmath25",
    "the gas is expected to be _ preheated _ by feedback effects of star formation : injections of energy of stellar origin like supernova winds eject the gas from the shallower potential wells , and heat the residual and the ejected gas to temperatures @xmath26 ( dekel & silk 1986 ; kaiser 1991 ; ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; david et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 ; cavaliere , colafrancesco & menci 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , preheating is necessary to prevent too short cooling times ( as pointed out by cole 1991 , and addressed by blanchard , valls gabaud & mamon 1992 ; see also white & rees 1978 ) in early potential wells , shallower on average but containing denser gas .",
    "subsequent evolution will lead to an increasing recovery of the universal baryonic fraction ( white et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "previous attempts ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) to tackle the @xmath3 relation are based on the _ extreme _ assumption that the gas inside the x - ray core @xmath11 is preheated but never subsequently shocked or mixed . here we discuss the _ other _ extreme , i.e. , the effects of shocks and mixing on the gas density inside clusters .",
    "as in the collapses the gas velocity becomes supersonic , shock fronts form at about @xmath4 , and separate the infalling from the inner gas already at virial temperatures .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations ( see evrard 1990 ; takizawa & mineshige 1997 ) of isotropic collapses show that , when the outer gas temperature is appreciably lower than the virial value @xmath17 , a spherical shock front forms and , in the vicinity of @xmath4 , slowly expands outwards leaving the gas nearly at rest and with a nearly flat temperature profile . when realistic , _ anisotropic _ collapses are considered ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 , tormen 1996 ) shock fronts still form and convert into heat most of the hydrodynamical energy ( schindler & mller 1993 ; schindler & bhringer 1993 ; rttiger , burnes , & loken 1993 ) .    across the shock",
    "the gas entropy rises , and correspondingly a jump in the gas density and in the temperature is established from the exterior values @xmath27 , @xmath28 to the interior ones @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the density jump provides a _ boundary _ condition for the inner gas distribution in the form of the compression factor @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the interior temperature @xmath30 governs , at equilibrium in a given gravitational potential , the inner density _ profile _ and hence the shape factor @xmath24 .",
    "these two effects enter eq .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath32 , and will be discussed in turn .",
    "the values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and of the interior gas velocity @xmath33 are related to their outer counterparts @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath34 by the requirements of mass , momentum and energy conservation across the shock .",
    "the plasma behaves as a perfect gas with three degrees of freedom , and the hugoniot adiabat ( see landau & lifshitz 1959 ) yields the compression factor @xmath35^{1/2}~.\\ ] ] for strong shocks with @xmath36 , this saturates to the value @xmath37 , while for @xmath38 it attains its lowest value @xmath39 .",
    "the pre - shock temperature @xmath28 is provided by the stellar ( thermonuclear ) energy feedbacks recalled in  1 , or by the virial ( gravitational ) temperature inside the clumps which are to merge with the cluster during its merging history considered below .",
    "in fact , the stellar feedbacks set for @xmath28 the lower bound @xmath40 which we identify with the lowest temperatures ( around @xmath41 kev , ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) measured in groups .",
    "pre - shock temperatures of this order do not affect the rich clusters ; instead , they affect the compression factor in the shallower potential wells with @xmath42 kev , as prevail at redshifts @xmath25 but are also present at @xmath43 .",
    "the full behavior of @xmath44 in shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 when @xmath45 and the latter is in the range @xmath46 kev .",
    "the actual values of @xmath28 will be discussed in  2.3 , taking into account the merging histories .",
    "the post - shock temperature @xmath30 can be calculated from the pre - shock velocity @xmath34 .",
    "the latter is driven by the gravitational potential @xmath47 , and reads @xmath48^{1/2}$ ] with @xmath49 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath50 is the radius where infall becomes nearly free ; its upper bound is obtained by equating the hubble flow to the free - fall velocity , which yields @xmath51 .",
    "the post - shock condition is closely hydrostatic , i.e. , @xmath52 , as shown by the simulations .",
    "then , using the equations in landau & lifshitz ( 1959 ) with the above value of @xmath34 , we find @xmath53    the inner gas profile relative to that of dm , @xmath54 say , is governed at equilibrium by the scale - height ratio @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the gas mean molecular weight , @xmath57 the proton mass , and @xmath58 the one  dimensional velocity dispersion of the dm .",
    "the profile @xmath59^{\\beta(t)}\\ ] ] ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) , applies for a nearly flat @xmath60 const @xmath61 .",
    "the function @xmath62 entering the profile ( 4 ) is easily computed from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , for a given dm potential v(r ) corresponding to @xmath63 . for the king potential ( see sarazin 1988 ) @xmath64/r$ ] with the core radius @xmath65",
    ", we obtain @xmath66 increasing somewhat from the value @xmath67 for @xmath68 to @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "a similar result obtains using the potential proposed by navarro et al .",
    "these two instances are illustrated in fig . 2 , and",
    "demonstrate that in all cases the static gas density profile is _ shallower _ for lower @xmath17 clusters .      for a given @xmath28 the compression factor @xmath71",
    "is computed after eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and the shape factor @xmath72 is obtained by integration of @xmath73 computed after eq .",
    "( 4 ) ; then the @xmath3 relation may be obtained from eq .",
    "( 1 ) . but",
    "@xmath28 depends on the thermal conditions of the infalling gas , which is preheated by supernovae and _ further _ heated through virialization inside merging clumps .    in the former case , we take @xmath74 kev with a flat distribution , and obtain for @xmath75 the dashed line in fig",
    ". 1 . in the latter case ,",
    "repeated merging events introduce fluctuations of @xmath28 above @xmath40 , and hence of the interior density @xmath76 , which modify @xmath75 .",
    "the average effect is shown by the solid line in fig . 1 , and the corresponding variance is illustrated by the shaded area .    to include both conditions , we take @xmath28 to be the _ higher _ between the preheating value @xmath40 and the virial temperatures prevailing in the clumps accreted by the cluster .",
    "we perform a statistical convolution of the @xmath3 relation over such merging histories , using monte carlo realizations of hierarchical merging trees of dark halos as introduced by cole ( 1991 ) .",
    "the code , written by one of us ( p.t . ) , is based directly on the excursion set approach of bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to the mass distribution .    for each merging event concerning a cluster with a current virial temperature @xmath77 ,",
    "we compute @xmath78 for the clumps being accreted , weighted with the associated mass fraction .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the quantity @xmath79 averaged over the histories ending into a cluster of temperature @xmath17 , along with its dispersion .",
    "these two quantities are used in eq .",
    "( 1 ) to predict the average @xmath3 correlation and its scatter .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 , for the dm potential of navarro et al . 1996",
    "; a different @xmath47 , like king s , only steepens somewhat the low-@xmath17 behavior .",
    "here we have proposed a model for the intracluster gas , to capture in a simple way one essential component of the complex gravitational systems constituted by groups and clusters .",
    "the model is focused on the formation of _ shocks _ between the the gas nearly in equilibrium with the cluster potential , and the infalling one .",
    "the latter is preheated by the release of thermonuclear energy , or by the gravitational energy in subclusters .",
    "shock heating and compression determine the @xmath3 relation .",
    "the latter comprises both clusters and small groups in a single dependence , which smoothly _ flattens _ from @xmath0 ( for groups with @xmath80 kev ) , to @xmath81 ( for clusters with 2 kev@xmath827 kev ) , toward @xmath2 ( for higher @xmath17 ) .",
    "such behavior fits both the cluster data ( edge & stewart 1991 ) and those for groups ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) which  if considered separately  would require a much steeper @xmath3 relation .",
    "correspondingly , the volume - averaged baryonic fraction grows by a factor around 3 from small groups to rich clusters , but remains within 1.3 times the universal value .",
    "in addition , we predict the gas density profiles to have a flat central region ( the gas `` core '' , see fig . 2 ) , independently of the detailed shape of the dm potential ; the profiles are actually _ steeper _ for larger virial temperatures .",
    "correspondingly , the size @xmath11 of the x - ray core ( defined , e.g. , at one half the integrated emission ) grows with mass slower than @xmath83 .",
    "the average cooling time within @xmath11 exceedes the hubble time out to @xmath84 , differently from the ss model .",
    "we have checked that these results _ persist _ when we relax the approximation of a flat temperature profile in the cluster , and adopt instead a polytropic distribution with index @xmath85 ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ; for for @xmath88 the temperature declines from the center toward the shock position .    in time",
    ", the shocked region expands and outgrows @xmath4 , the infall velocity decreases , and the shock weakens with @xmath30 approaching @xmath28 .",
    "however , this occurs only over several dynamical times as shown by the n - body simulations ( see takizawa & mineshige 1997 ) ; meanwhile , the shock positions remain close to @xmath4 , as taken here .",
    "we do not stress , instead , the @xmath89-dependence @xmath90 of the normalization provided by the factor @xmath91 appearing in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in fact , such dependence is easily swamped by the place - to - place variations of @xmath92 and by the systematic increase in contrast of the large scale structures hosting groups and clusters ( see ramella , geller , & huchra 1992 ) .",
    "the robust predictions of the shock model do not require spherical symmetry , but only a small bulk velocity of the inner gas compared to @xmath93 .",
    "thus the model includes _ anisotropic _ , recurrent merging with other clumps of dark and baryonic matter .",
    "the effects of extreme merging events are as follows .",
    "the few events involving _ comparable _ subclusters reshuffle the baryonic content and mix its entropy , but only moderatly affect temperature and density . at the other extreme , the more isotropic accretion to a cluster of many _ small _ condensations _ gravitationally _ heated at temperatures",
    "@xmath94 kev yields the highest compression and the largest contribution to the x - ray luminosity .",
    "our _ monte carlo _",
    "simulations span the range between these extremes .",
    "the stellar preheating at @xmath40 of the external gas is essential to provide a lower limit for @xmath28 .",
    "this ensures that the accreting gas , even when in a very shallow well or in a diffuse state , starts on a relatively high adiabat , corresponding to @xmath95 kev .",
    "such a heating of _ thermonuclear _ origin breaks down the otherwise self - similar form @xmath96cost of the ratio of gas to dm density to yield , at the boundary , the form @xmath97 shown in fig .",
    "values of @xmath40 smaller than 0.5 kev would lead , in a strictly self - similar evolution of dm halos , to @xmath2 at variance with the data ; larger values to a severe depletion of the gas and of the luminosities in groups and clusters .",
    "the merging histories also produce the considerable scatter in the @xmath3 relation shown in fig.3 , since the different virial temperatures of the stochastically merging clumps induce intrinsic variance in the internal density @xmath76 .",
    "further scatter may be contributed by the vagaries in the ambient density @xmath92 , and by the possible lack of dynamical equilibrium in some groups , see discussion by governato , tozzi & cavaliere 1996 .",
    "the shock model in the simple form presented here applies to the gas settled to equilibrium after each dynamical perturbation .",
    "this takes sound propagation times , somewhat shorter than the dynamical timescale taken anyway by the dm to adjust to equilibrium ( tormen 1996 ) .",
    "the residual converging motions , even in spherical n - body simulations ( takizawa & mineshige 1997 ) , tend to balance the expansion of the shocked region to yield only small net velocities @xmath98 km / s . these may be associated with some adiabatic compression of the central regions , but the resulting heating is only mild , as long as shocks form at radii of order @xmath4 .",
    "the other extreme is tackled by the model proposed by kaiser ( 1991 ) and refined by evrard & henry ( 1991 ) .",
    "this assumes that , after preheating , the central cluster region visible in x - rays contains the same gas ( about 10 % of the present total ) engaged in a smooth adiabatic compression .",
    "however , we find only @xmath99 of the largest single progenitors to have masses ( dm and hence gas ) exceeding @xmath100 of the present values at @xmath101 , when most stellar preheating takes place . on the other hand , n - body simulations ( see refs . in  2 ) and observations ( see zabludoff & zaritsky 1995 ) show that each cluster history includes a few merging events between comparable structures , which will reset the core gas to a higher adiabat .",
    "the adiabatic model ( with preheating ) predicts a single , scale - free relation @xmath81 , or @xmath14 if the gas equilibrium holds out to @xmath4 as in evrard & henry ( 1991 ) .",
    "however , on the largest scales that ought to sample fairly the universal baryonic fraction ( white et al .",
    "1993 ) one expects saturation toward the scaling @xmath2 of the ss model ; in addition , at the group scales a much steeper dependence is indicated by observations .",
    "such opposite departures of the @xmath3 correlation from a single power - law are beyond the reach of the adiabatic model , but within the predictions of the shock model .",
    "the model we propose leads ( cavaliere , menci , tozzi 1997 ) to a local luminosity function @xmath102 in agreement with the data , and to @xmath103 with the mild or no evolution shown by recent data , and confirmed by the deep x - ray counts .",
