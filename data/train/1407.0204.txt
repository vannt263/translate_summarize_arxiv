    "computer models are powerful tools that enable researchers to investigate complex systems from almost every imaginable field of studies in natural sciences , engineering , social sciences and humanities .",
    "computer models can be stochastic or deterministic ; we consider deterministic computer models . when the computer code representing a computer model is expensive to run , it is desirable to build a cheaper surrogate model .",
    "computer experiments are concerned with the building of a statistical surrogate model based on the data consisting of a set of carefully selected inputs and the corresponding outputs from running a computer code .    designing a computer experiment ,",
    "that is , the selection of inputs , is a crucial step in the process of model building .",
    "no matter how elaborate and sophisticated a model building process is , a statistical model contains no more information than what the data can offer . in the past two decades",
    ", space - filling designs have been widely accepted as appropriate designs for computer experiments .",
    "a space - filling design refers to , in a very broad sense , any design that strews its points in the design region in some uniform fashion .",
    "the uniformity of a design may be evaluated using a distance criterion [ @xcite ] or a discrepancy criterion [ @xcite ] .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more details .",
    "orthogonality has also been playing a significant role in constructing designs for computer experiments as it , in addition to being useful in its own right , provides a stepping stone to achieving uniformity [ @xcite ] .",
    "the curse of dimensionality , however , makes it extremely difficult for the points of a design to provide a good coverage of a high dimensional design region .",
    "even 10,000 points are not enough for a @xmath1 grid in an @xmath2 dimensional space , not to mention that such a regular grid leaves a deep hole in the center of the @xmath1 points . in such situations , it makes more sense to consider designs that are space - filling in lower dimensional projections of the input space .",
    "the idea of latin designs is to achieve the maximum uniformity in all one - dimensional projections [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xmath3-based latin hypercubes [ @xcite ] carry this idea further , which give designs that , in addition to being latin hypercubes , achieve uniformity in @xmath4-dimensional margins when orthogonal arrays of strength @xmath4 are employed .",
    "one could also use orthogonal arrays directly [ @xcite ] but such designs do not perform well in one - dimensional projections when orthogonal arrays have small numbers of levels .",
    "@xcite introduced , constructed and studied a new class of arrays , _ strong orthogonal arrays _ , for computer experiments .",
    "a strong orthogonal array of strength @xmath4 does as well as a comparable orthogonal array in @xmath4-dimensional projections , but the former achieves uniformity on finer grids than the latter in all @xmath5-dimensional projections for any @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , latin hypercubes constructed from a strong orthogonal array of strength @xmath4 are more space - filling than comparable @xmath3-based latin hypercubes in all @xmath5-dimensional projections for any @xmath7 .",
    "the concept of strong orthogonal arrays is motivated by the notion of nets from quasi - monte carlo methods [ @xcite ] .",
    "the formulation of this new concept has two advantages .",
    "first , strong orthogonal arrays are more general than nets in terms of run sizes ; and second , strong orthogonal arrays are defined in the form and language that are familiar to design practitioners and researchers .",
    "this not only makes existing results from nets more accessible to design community but also allows us to obtain new designs and theoretical results .",
    "the present article focuses on strong orthogonal arrays of strength three . through a notion of semi - embeddability",
    ", we provide a complete yet very simple characterization for such arrays . though the characterization using generalized orthogonal arrays in @xcite is general , our new characterization for strength three is more direct and revealing .",
    "apart from this main result , some other results on strong orthogonal arrays of strength three are also obtained . in particular , we construct two strong orthogonal arrays of 54 runs , five factors , 27 levels and strength three .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] introduces some notation and background material . in section  [ sec3 ] , a notion of semi - embeddability is defined , through which we present the main result of the paper , stating that a strong orthogonal array of strength three exists if and only if a semi - embeddable orthogonal array of strength three exists .",
    "we then examine the semi - embeddability and nonsemi - embeddability of some orthogonal arrays .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] constructs two @xmath8 s .",
    "a discussion is given in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "this section provides a preparation for the rest of the paper by introducing necessary notation and some background material .",
    "an @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 with its @xmath11th column taking levels @xmath12 is said to be an orthogonal array of size @xmath13 , @xmath14 factors , and strength @xmath4 if for any @xmath15 sub - matrix of  @xmath10 , all possible level combinations occur equally often .",
    "such an array is denoted by @xmath16 in this paper .",
    "if at least two @xmath17 s are unequal , the array is said to be asymmetrical or have mixed levels . when @xmath18 , we obtain a symmetrical orthogonal array , in which case , the array is denoted by @xmath19 .",

    ", monte carlo methods evaluate the integrand at a set of points selected randomly , whereas quasi - monte carlo methods do so at a set of points selected in a deterministic .",

    ", the set of points for quasi - monte carlo methods should therefore be chosen to have a small star discrepancy .",
    "when an infinite sequence of points is considered , we use @xmath76 to denote the star discrepancy given by the first @xmath13 points of the sequence .",
    "the best general lower bounds on @xmath74 and @xmath76 are those of @xcite stating that @xmath77 for a point set and @xmath78 for an infinite sequence , where @xmath79 is a constant independent of  @xmath13 .",

    "what makes @xmath82-nets and @xmath83-sequences attractive is that they have much smaller implied constants while satisfying the lower bounds in ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath82-nets and @xmath83-sequences contain an orthogonal array structure , which was pointed out by @xcite and used by @xcite to construct nested space - filling designs for multi - fidelity computer experiments .    in what follows",

    "this is in the same spirit as the generalization of orthogonal latin squares to orthogonal arrays of strength two .",
    "@xcite discussed several families of strong orthogonal arrays that can not be obtained from @xmath84-nets .",
    "because of lemma  [ lemma2 ] , it is not unreasonable to expect that the star discrepancy of strong orthogonal arrays would also be @xmath100 just like nets , although a precise presentation and rigorous derivation of this result may require some serious work .",
    "since our focus is the finite sample space - filling properties of strong orthogonal arrays , we choose not to dwell any further on the issue of discrepancy in this paper .",
