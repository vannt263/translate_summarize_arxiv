    "finally , in section  [ sec : modk ] we concludes with some remarks .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new class of partitions as well as a key decomposition that will be the main tools to obtain all of our results .",

    "we need two more definitions to present our decomposition .",
    "given @xmath58 , we shall consider two special subsets of @xmath9 as follows :    * @xmath66 : the set of @xmath0-strict partitions ; * @xmath67 : the set of partitions with parts @xmath68 , and each part occurs even times .",
    "we denote @xmath69 as @xmath70 for short , then by definition  [ kstrictdef ] , one checks easily that @xmath71 , but @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the above observation hopefully makes it clear that when we associate @xmath0-strict partitions with recent results on new little gllnitz identities ( section  [ sec : mod2 ] ) and capparelli s new companion ( section  [ sec : mod3 ] ) , why the @xmath51-strict case has more intricate conditions than the @xmath53-strict case .",
    "let @xmath58 be a positive integer . given a partition @xmath7",
    ", we label the cells in the odd - indexed ( resp .",
    "even - indexed ) rows of @xmath74 diagram cyclically from left to right with @xmath75 ( resp .",

    "remove the first @xmath95 appearances of @xmath92 from @xmath7 . as for the labelling on these removed parts ,",
    "if the first copy of @xmath92 is odd - indexed in @xmath7 , then keep their original @xmath77-labels , if the first copy is even - indexed , then swap @xmath96 for the labellings in these @xmath95 copies , since these are even number of copies , so the total weight is preserved .",
