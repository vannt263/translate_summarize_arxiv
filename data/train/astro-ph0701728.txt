    "in a recent paper ( @xcite ) we demonstrated that galaxy bimodality is not just evident in color ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) but also in the joint color - structure plane ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in that work we used sdss photometry and single srsic ( 1963 ;",
    "@xcite ) profile fits to investigate the distribution of 10,095 relatively nearby luminous ( @xmath6 mag ) galaxies in the color - srsic index plane .",
    "the red peak is comprised of highly concentrated , high - srsic index systems while the blue peak contains more diffuse , low - srsic index systems .",
    "this is important as any movement from the blue peak to the red peak will require modifying the orbits , angular momentum and energy of the entire stellar population .",
    "a simple inert process ( e.g. , exhaustion of the gas supply , stripping , etc . ) could not achieve this , although a violent major merger event could ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps more importantly , when the population was segregated by hubble type we found that while the early - type galaxies ( e / s0s , i.e. , bulge dominated ) lay almost exclusively in the red - concentrated peak , and the late - type spirals ( sd / irr , i.e. , disc dominated ) in the blue - diffuse peak , the mid - type spirals ( sabc , i.e. , bulge plus disc systems ) straddled both peaks with no obvious sign of bimodality .",
    "we inferred from this that galaxy bimodality arises because of the two component nature of galaxies and that spheroidal structures ( i.e. , ellipticals and bulges ) will lie exclusively in the red - compact peak and discs in the blue - diffuse peak .",
    "as classical bulges lie within thin rotating disc systems this argues for early spheroid formation ( via rapid merging or collapse ) followed by a more quiescent phase in which the extended disc can form . to explore this further",
    "we have performed bulge - disc decomposition of all 10,095 galaxies in the millennium galaxy catalogue ( see @xcite ) by fitting two - component srsic - bulge plus exponential - disc models using gim2d ( @xcite ) . in this letter",
    "we report the luminosity functions derived for various component samples ( e.g.  ellipticals , bulges , discs ) and tabulate the associated luminosity and stellar mass densities for each component class .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and adopt @xmath10(100 km s@xmath11",
    "mpc@xmath11 ) for ease of comparison with other results .",
    "the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) is a deep ( @xmath12  mag  arcsec@xmath13 ) , wide area ( @xmath14  deg@xmath15 ) , @xmath16-band imaging and redshift survey covering a @xmath17  deg wide strip along the equatorial sky from 10h to 14h 50@xmath18 .",
    "the mgc contains 10,095 galaxies down to @xmath19  mag , of which 9,696 have redshift information .",
    "full details of the imaging survey can be found in liske et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with the spectroscopic follow - up described by driver et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter d05 ) . in allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) the bulge - disc decompositions were reported for all 10,095 @xmath20  mag galaxies , and a final structural catalogue produced , consisting of bulge - only ( srsic profiles ) , disc - only ( srsic or exponential profiles ) and bulge plus disc systems ( srsic plus exponential profiles ) .",
    "luminosity functions are computed using the standard step - wise maximum likelihood ( swml ) estimator originally described by efstathiou , ellis & peterson ( 1988 ) , with samples divided into bins of absolute magnitude .",
    "the mgc spectroscopic sample has a nominal kron magnitude limit of @xmath19  mag .",
    "however , here we will use the gim2d total magnitudes ( derived by integrating the light profiles to infinity ) so that there is no longer a single limit that applies to the sample as a whole . to accommodate for this",
    ", each galaxy now has a unique magnitude limit , defined by : @xmath21 .",
    "following d05 , we restrict our sample to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath22 and within carefully defined size and surface brightness boundaries ( see d05 and liske et al .",
    "2006 for full details ) .      in d05 individual k - corrections were derived for each galaxy by comparing the total galaxy broad - band colors ( @xmath23 ) to the 27 spectral templates given in poggianti ( 1998 ) and identifying the best fitting spectrum .",
    "having now separated the mgc galaxies into bulges and discs ( see @xcite ) the global k - correction is not necessarily valid .",
    "however , approximately @xmath24 per cent of our sample are best fit by one component profiles ( i.e. , bulge - only or disc - only galaxies ) and for these systems we adopt the k - corrections as previously derived in d05 . for the remaining , two - component systems we consider our component colors too coarse to be used to derive robust individual k - corrections ( as our decompositions are done in a single filter only ) . for the case of blue bulges and blue discs",
    "the global k - correction is likely to be appropriate for both ( assumming that the blue bulge has formed from the disc ) . in the case of discs surrounding classical red bulges we note that for low-@xmath25 systems the k - correction is likely to be appropriate for the discs but not the bulges . in the case of high-@xmath25 systems",
    "we note that peletier & bacells ( 1996 ) report that such discs are typically redder .",
    "we therefore consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the global k - correction for both our discs and blue bulges .",
    "for the red bulges , however , we adopt the spectral template most frequently adopted by our single component red ellipticals ( a sa 15 gyr spectrum ) .",
    "this spectrum can be represented by a fourth order polynomial valid over the redshift range @xmath26 only : @xmath27 we note that if we follow a similar procedure for the discs and blue bulges the implied characteristic turnover luminosities ( shown in table  1 ) are systematically reduced by @xmath28  mag and the implied stellar masses reduced by @xmath29 per cent . to model evolution",
    "we assume pure luminosity evolution of the following form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is set to @xmath32 for the global luminosity function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath33 for blue components ( discs , blue bulges , blue ellipticals ) , and @xmath34 for red components ( red bulges and red ellipticals ) .",
    "these values are based on the recent results reported in zucca et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for red and blue systems ( their type 1 and 4 respectively ) .",
    "we do not model number evolution as the redshift range is small and our merger rate estimates , based on dynamically close pairs within the mgc , are low ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "1 shows the luminosity distributions and schechter function fits for our full galaxy sample ( upper left ) , ellipticals only ( upper right ; i.e.  objects with @xmath35 after logical filtering , see fig .",
    "13 of allen et al .  2006 ) , discs ( lower left ) and bulges ( lower right ) .",
    "note that the schechter function in the upper left differs from that shown in d05 because the magnitudes are now based on srsic profiles integrated to infinity rather than kron magnitudes .",
    "this difference is significant , resulting in a brighter @xmath36 value by about @xmath37  mag but a comparable faint - end slope , @xmath38 .",
    "analysis of independent repeat observations of @xmath39 galaxies suggests that our decompositions are valid to good accuracy ( @xmath40  mag and @xmath41  mag , see allen et al .",
    "2006 ) for componentss with luminosities with @xmath6  mag .",
    "below this limit our decompositions become increasingly less reliable and these data are shown with open symbols . the most striking result from fig .  1 is the rapidly rising faint - end slope for the elliptical population .",
    "this was noted previously in driver et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and was shown to be due to contamination of the classical elliptical sample by low luminosity blue spheroids ( see also @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the color - structure plane defined by sdss core ( @xmath42 ) psf color versus component srsic index for the ellipticals ( upper left ) and galaxy bulges ( upper right ) . the bimodality of the ellipticals is striking , with a blue and red population being apparent .",
    "the blue sample defines what we label blue ellipticals which were identified in ellis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and quantified in driver et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . a cut at @xmath43  mag provides a clear division .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "2 show the luminosity distributions and schechter function fits for the blue and red samples .",
    "we see that red ellipticals and blue ellipticals follow markedly different trends and it is indeed the blue ellipticals which are responsible for the apparent upturn in the total elliptical galaxy luminosity function at very faint absolute magnitudes .",
    "we note that when the bulges are divided in the same manner , the blue bulge luminosity function is very similar to that of the ellipticals , possibly indicating some common origin .",
    "it is tempting to associate the blue bulges with pseudo - bulges ( see kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) , which are believed to arise from inner disc instabilities giving rise to a swelling of the disc in the central region . as many of our blue bulges have @xmath44  mag , where our bulge - disc decompositions become unreliable , we can not unambiguously confirm this population as pseudo - bulges but for the moment adopt this nomenclature for ease of discussion .",
    "the blue ellipticals remain somewhat intriguing and appear to define a new class of object as previously noted by ellis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and driver et al .",
    "( 2006 ; see also @xcite who identify them as a rapidly fading population ) .",
    "we are currently exploring these systems further ( @xcite ) and for the moment simply flag them as interesting . from their distinct luminosity function",
    "it is clear they are predominantly low luminosity systems and could potentially represent the local counterparts to the luminous blue compact galaxies studied by guzman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and phillips et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "3 shows the final component luminosity functions with the red ellipticals and red bulges combined into a single red spheroid group and the blue ellipticals and blue bulges grouped together into a single blue spheroid class .",
    "the justification for this is the similarity in the shapes and ranges of the luminosity distributions from fig .  2 .",
    "table  1 shows the schechter function values for the luminosity function fits shown in figs .  1 , 2 & 3 , along with their associated @xmath45-band luminosity , @xmath46 , and stellar mass densities , @xmath47 .",
    "these are derived using the following expressions : @xmath48 and @xmath49 the latter expression is first shown in driver et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and is based on the color to mass - to - light ratios given by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) which assume a salpeter-lite imf .",
    "note that the @xmath50 colour for each galaxy was obtained by matching the mgc to the sloan digital sky survey first data release ( abazajian et al .",
    "from table  1 we see that @xmath1 per cent of the stellar mass is in the form of galaxy discs , @xmath3 per cent in red elliptical galaxies and @xmath4 per cent in classical red bulges .",
    "previously it has been reported ( bell et al .  2003 ; baldry et al .",
    "2004 ; driver et al .",
    "2006 ) that @xmath51 per cent of the stellar mass lies in the red peak dominated by early - type galaxies .",
    "as we have now separated the early - type galaxies into bulges and discs one expects that the spheroid ( elliptical+bulge ) stellar mass density should be lower than the early - type stellar mass density , which of course includes the associated disc components of the lenticular galaxies . examining the color - structure plane ( fig .",
    "2 upper panels ) for ellipticals and bulges we see that the red populations ( of each type ) lie in the same location .",
    "this is indicative of a shared origin for red ellipticals and classical red bulges .",
    "when combined the red spheroids account for @xmath2 per cent of the stellar mass density .",
    "hence the bulk of the stellar mass ( @xmath52 per cent ) exists in the two classical structures originally defined by de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath53 per cent lie in the form of blue ellipticals ( @xmath54 per cent ) and blue bulges ( @xmath5 per cent ) .",
    "these latter two populations can therefore be considered minor from a cosmological perspective .",
    "furthermore , as the blue bulges are likely to represent either difficulties in the decomposition ( e.g. , bars ) or pseudo - bulges ( disc swelling ) , their stellar mass could arguably be added , in either case , to that of the galaxy discs ( i.e. , @xmath55 per cent ) .",
    "the nature of the blue ellipticals ( previously dubbed blue spheroids ) remains uncertain but they appear to constitute a very small fraction of the stellar mass budget , although we must note the near divergent faint - end slopes .",
    "the primary conclusion then is that the stellar mass is mainly divided between two distinct structures : blue 2d discs and red 3d spheroids .",
    "finally we note that the results presented in this letter are based on @xmath16-band data and therefore susceptible to dust attenuation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "bell & de jong ( 2001 ) argue that the effect on an individual galaxy s stellar mass is less than one might expect ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) because the observed decrease in total luminosity is offset by the increased stellar mass - to - light ratio inferred from the redenned colors , therefore yielding comparable final stellar masses . we explore this in detail in driver et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and note that while the masses are modified somewhat the final stellar mass breakdown is not dramatically altered .",
    "the millennium galaxy catalogue consists of imaging data from the isaac newton telescope and spectroscopic data from the anglo australian telescope , the anu 2.3 m , the eso new technology telescope , the telescopio nazionale galileo , and the gemini telescope .",
    "the survey has been supported through grants from the particle physics and astronomy research council ( uk ) and the australian research council ( aus ) .",
