    "the study of superconductor ( s)/ ferromagnet ( f ) proximity systems allows a direct investigation of the interplay between the two competing orders of superconductivity and ferromagnetism . in a highly transparent s / normal - metal ( n ) junction , superconducting correlations are induced in n while they are weakened in the s side .",
    "the mechanism underlying the proximity effect ( pe ) is the andreev reflection ( ar ) : a hole - like quasiparticle impinging on the interface from the n side is retro - reflected as an electron - like quasiparticle with opposite momentum and spin while destroying a cooper pair in the s. consequently , in s / f junctions , the properties of the pe are significantly modified due to the spin polarization and the presence of an exchange field in f. theoretical works predict a rapid oscillatory decay of the induced superconducting order parameter inside f. @xcite these predictions , that were confirmed by various experiments @xcite , stem from the singlet pairing in the s , and hold for both _ s_-wave and _ d_-wave ( along antinodal directions ) superconductors.@xcite however , the understanding of how the anisotropy of the _ d_-wave symmetry within the a - b plane manifests itself in the pe in the presence of an exchange field , is still rudimentary . in particular , it is still unclear what happens to the andreev bound states ( abs ) that reside at the nodal surfaces of _",
    "d_-wave s and how , in turn , they affect the density of states ( dos ) of f. + splitting the current carrying abs requires the removal of either their directional or spin degeneracy . the former may result from the admixture of a subdominant order parameter @xcite while the latter may be due to a small magnetization at the surface .",
    "a possible origin of such a surface magnetization is the background antiferromagnetic correlations in the underdoped regime of the high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "@xcite alternatively , a magnetization inside the s may also result from a proximity to a magnetic layer .",
    "recent theoretical works that considered the inverse pe in s / f bilayers predict an induced magnetization in the s side over a length - scale of the superconducting coherence length , @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the direction of the induced magnetic moment near the interface may be parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization in f , depending on the interface transparency , the thickness of f and the strength of the exchange field .",
    "experimentally , there is little evidence for such an induced magnetization.@xcite the induced magnetization is expected to remove the spin degeneracy of the abs at the s / f interface and shift them to finite energies .",

    "the penetration is reflected in the dos of the f layer as a split zbcp with a pronounced imbalance between split peak heights .",

    "this island topography enabled us to measure , on the same sample , the evolution of the dos from that of a bare ( 110)ybco surface to the dos of a ferromagnet in proximity to a ( 110 ) surface .",

    "it is important to note that in thin sro films of thicknesses lower than 5 unit cells , @xmath9 decreases substantially.@xcite therefore it is expected that the exchange field and local magnetization in films that feature thickness variations at these ranges will not be uniform .",
    "1b depicts a squid magnetometer magnetization measurement performed on a 3 nm thick sro layer over - coating a ( 110)ybco layer .",
    "the onset of the ferromagnetic transition at @xmath10 k is clearly observed , indicating that our sro layers at these thicknesses are ferromagnetic .",
    "however , it is also apparent that there is a distribution of the value of @xmath9 : the transition is not sharp and takes place over a range of temperatures starting from 150 k down to 130 k ( marked by arrows in fig .",

    "this inhomogeneity stems from two main factors .",

    "the zbcp is shifted to + 3 mev and the peak appears to be broadened .",
    "in fact , our overall accumulated data ( see below ) implies that this shifted and broadened peak reflects a split zbcp in which the negative energy peak ( in this case ) is largely suppressed and smeared ( due to noise and life - time broadening effects ) .",
    "+ the typical tunneling spectra that were obtained on the sro crystallites featured a pronounced split of the zbcps with a varying degree of imbalance between the positive and negative peak heights .",
    "this imbalance ranges from a nearly symmetrical , double - peak structure to an asymmetrical split in which one of the peaks is fully suppressed .",
    "interestingly , the suppression of both the positive and negative peaks were observed with roughly the same occurrence ( even on the same sample ) .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the split ( energy shift of abs ) also featured pronounced changes ranging between less than 1 mev and a maximum energy shift of @xmath12 mev ( much larger than the known split amplitude due to the admixture of a sub - dominant op at optimal doping).@xcite we note that a wide range of both the degree of imbalance and the energy shift were observed on all samples with average sro thickness up to 9 nm .",

    "3c is roughly the same as in 3a but here the negative energy peak is suppressed . in fig .",
    "3d the suppression is , again , at the negative side and only a trace of the negative peak is still detectable , yet more than in 3b .",
    "+        the range of the energy shift is demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 . here , the di / dv curves were acquired sequentially at equal steps along a 200 nm long line taken on a 2 nm thick sro layer .",
    "the zbcp evolves from a centered zbcp ( bottom curve ) into a shifted zbcp where the energy shift increases up to a value of 4.5 mev ( upper curve ) .",
    "this variation of the energy shift occurs on a single sro island ( as demonstrated also in fig .",
    "it is important to note that there is no clear correlation between the magnitude of the split ( energy shift ) and the degree of imbalance between peak heights ( e. g. , compare figure 3a and 3b ) , suggesting that these two effects have a different origin .",
    "+        we shall first address the mechanism by which abs can penetrate the f layer .",
    "the formation of abs at the bare nodal ( 110 ) surface in ybco can be understood within the framework of a quasiclassical insulator ( i)/n / s quantum well model@xcite , where an effective n layer of thickness @xmath2 results from the pair breaking nature of nodal surfaces . here ,",
    "the current carrying abs correspond to closed quasiparticle trajectories consisting of ars at the s / n interface and normal reflections at the free interface .",
    "a metallic n layer , that is in good electrical contact with the s , serves as an extension of the above - mentioned inherent n region at the nodal surface and the ins model is still valid .",
    "@xcite the picture is more intricate if the n layer is replaced with a spin polarized f layer .",
    "the ar is suppressed due to the imbalance between up and down spin populations . moreover ,",
    "the wave - vector mismatch between quasiparticles with up and down spins in f leads to breaking of the retro - reflectivity of the ar process.@xcite this means that after two consecutive andreev and normal reflections the quasiparticle will reach the s / f interface at some distance , l , from the originally impinging quasiparticle and thus a closed trajectory will not be realized .",
    "however , as long as @xmath14 , abs can still be formed .",
    "the above constraints , and the virtual andreev reflection process@xcite , will result in a decreased spectral weight of the abs .",
    "nevertheless , the penetration of abs into an f layer is still possible and is observed here by the pronounced zbcp we measured in the dos of the f layer .",
    "the reduced spectral weight is also demonstrated in the above data ( figures 2 and 4 ) .",
    "the abs will survive in the f layer as long as its thickness is smaller then the mean free path and phase coherence is maintained between the electron - like and hole - like quasiparticles along their trajectories .",
    "our results show a clear penetration of the abs up to thicknesses of 9 nm .",
    "the mean free path in our sro islands could be significantly smaller than 50 nm , the value measured in single - crystals at 1.8 k.@xcite phase coherence in f is maintained on the length - scale of the the f - coherence length , which is estimated to be 3 nm in the clean limit.@xcite therefore , one should not expect penetration to distances larger than @xmath15 9 nm .",
    "we emphasize that the measured zbcp was continuous all over the sro crystallites and was not localized along narrow and elongated strips .",
    "for that reason , the observed penetration of abs into the sro layer can not be accounted for by effects related to magnetic domain walls , as was the case in our previous work on ( 110)ybco / sro ( antinodal - ybco / sro ) bilayers .",
    "@xcite in that study , the op penetrated the f layer to distances above 26 nm , an order of magnitude larger than the f - coherence length .",
    "this penetration , however , took place only along narrow and elongated strips , separated by at least 200 nm , consistent with the known magnetic domain wall structure in @xmath16 .",
    "this behavior was attributed to crossed andreev reflections , taking place in the vicinity of the magnetic domain walls.@xcite + the observed imbalance between peak heights is a consequence of the spin polarization inside the f layer : the peak that corresponds to the minority spins in f is suppressed with respect to that corresponding to the majority spins .",
    "however , the exchange field in f is not expected to split the penetrating abs , as it does not split the coherence peaks of the observed@xcite induced gaps in s. we therefore suggest that the splitting of the abs takes place at the interface or inside s. our observation that the negative and positive energy peaks are suppressed with the same occurrence supports this conjecture .",
    "when the spin degeneracy of the abs is lifted and the zbcp is split , the peak that corresponds to the minority ( majority ) spins is shifted to positive ( negative ) energies .",
    "consequently , if the splitting occurs inside f , then the spin polarization should always suppress the peak that corresponds to the minority spins , i. e. , the suppression is always expected to occur in the same side regardless of the direction of magnetization in f. which of the sides ( positive or negative ) will be suppressed in f is determined by the sign of its spin polarization , which is known to be negative in sro ( i.e. , the majority spin at the fermi surface is antiparallel to the bulk magnetization).@xcite therefore , only the negative peak is expected to be suppressed in that case , in contrast to our observation .",
    "this strongly indicates that the splitting can not occur inside the f islands .",
    "moreover , the lack of correlation between the degree of splitting and imbalance provides further evidence that the splitting does not occur inside f. we believe that the observed splitting is a consequence of an induced magnetization inside s that penetrates it to a distance of @xmath2 . as noted above , this induced magnetization can be parallel or antiparallel to that in f , depending on local changes in the thickness of the f layer and the interface transparency .",
    "@xcite therefore , both negative and positive sides can be suppressed ( on the same sample ) , depending on the relative direction of magnetization with respect to that of f. + we now turn to discuss the magnitude of the split .",
    "the relevant energy scale is the exchange energy , @xmath17 , which sets the upper limit for the value of the energy shift . in sro , @xmath18 and",
    "would correspond to a maximum energy shift of @xmath19 mev to each side .",
    "the induced magnetization should be weaker and hence the lower values we typically observe .",
    "as demonstrated in figures 2 and 4 , the observed energy shift can change at different lateral locations on the same f layer , even on the same crystallite .",
    "this can be explained by local changes in thickness of the f layer and/or the interface transparency that cause a non - uniformity in the induced magnetization . in general , the energy shift ( or split amplitude ) become larger as we move towards the center of the island , where the thickness is usually larger compared to the rims .",
    "this is consistent with stronger magnetization and consequently stronger induced magnetization in s , yielding larger splits ( shifts ) at the ybco side of the interface .",
    "the magnetic non - uniformity of the sro layer , manifested in the distribution of the sro s @xmath9 in fig .",
    "1b , supports this assumption .",
    "the junction transparency , on the other hand , is not expected to change within an island over such distances .",
    "so , it seems that the local magnetization affects our spectra , although the interface transparency and its variations ( mainly from island to island ) may also play an important role .",
    "+ a theoretical model that is seemingly related to our experiment was introduced by kashiwaya et al . , who studied the conductance properties of ferromagnet / ferromagnet - insulator / d - wave superconductor junctions .",
    "@xcite their calculated i - v characteristics exhibit ( in the case of the nodal s surface ) spectral features similar to some of those observed in our measurements , namely , an asymmetric split of the zbcp , where the peak at positive energy is suppressed . as in our case",
    ", the polarization of the f electrode suppresses the peak that corresponds to the minority spins .",
    "however , in their model the splitting of the zbcp is a consequence of spin filtering , namely , different effective barrier heights that are felt by quasi - particles with opposite spins that tunnel through the ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "@xcite in spite of the fact that we could achieve good fits to our spectra using this model , we do not believe that it applies to our experiment , as explained below .",
    "very low f / s interface transparencies are needed in order to reproduce our spectral features by this model , even lower than the typical values corresponding to the tunnel junction between the stm tip and the sample ( @xmath20 within the btk formalism @xcite ) .",
    "such low transparencies are not consistent , to say the least , with our previous sts studies of sro / ybco bilayers @xcite and magnetoresistance investigations in ybco / sro / ybco trilayers @xcite where proximity effects were observed , implying highly transparent ( low @xmath21 of less than 1 ) interfaces ( that also allow for induced magnetization in the ybco layer ) .",
    "consequently , in our measurements transport is dominated by the tip - sample tunnel junction and therefore our spectra reflect the dos at the sro surface and thus monitor the penetration of the abs into the sro layer .",
    "in contrast , the i - v spectra calculated by the kashiwaya et al .",
    "model reflect the properties of the s / f interface , in particular the effect of spin filtering .",
    "we also like to point out that the spin filtering scenario can not naturally account , in our bilayers , for those spectra in which the negative peak is suppressed . for this to occur ,",
    "one has to impose the existence of an insulating ferromagnetic layer ( between the ybco and sro layers ) having spin polarization opposite to that of the bulk sro , which is unrealistic .",
    "in summary , our scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of @xmath0 bilayers clearly reveal a penetration of the abs into the f layer and provide evidence for the predicted splitting of abs at the s / f interfaces due to an effect of induced magnetization at the s side .",
