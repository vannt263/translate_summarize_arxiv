    "massive ob stars , not having an optically visible pre - main sequence ( pms ) contraction phase , appear almost immediately after their birth on the main sequence ( e.g. stahler & palla 2005 ) .",
    "they are mostly grouped in stellar associations , loose concentrations of stars , which host also significant numbers of intermediate- and low - mass pms stars ( see review by briceo et al .",
    "when the far - uv radiation of the bright ob stars reaches the surface of the parental molecular cloud , a photo - dissociated region ( pdr ) develops .",
    "nebula lha  115-n  66 or in short",
    "n  66 ( henize 1956 ) , the brightest h  ii region in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , being very rich in early - type stars , is certainly an excellent example of an extragalactic pdr .",
    "the stellar association ngc  346 , located in the central part of the nebula , hosts the largest sample of spectroscopically confirmed ob stars in the smc ( massey et al .",
    "1989 ) , which have been the subject of several previous investigations ( niemela et al .",
    "1986 ; walborn et al .",
    "2000 ; evans et al . 2006 ) .",
    "these massive stars evolve rapidly , and immediately start to ionize the cloud , blowing its material away .",
    "the degree of ionization decreases outwards , and a thin barrier develops that segregates the ionized from the atomic gas .",
    "molecular hydrogen is not fully ionized behind this front , but partly dissociated , while co molecules which are located a bit deeper into the cloud are more easily dissociated than h@xmath0 by absorbing uv photons .",
    "a correlation between h@xmath0 infrared emission and co lines , characteristic of a pdr , has been found for the region of ngc  346/n  66 by contursi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and rubio et al .",
    "these authors define the `` bar '' of n  66 as the oblique bright emission region , extending from southeast to northwest centered on ngc  346 .",
    "they suggest that _ star formation has taken place as a sequential process in the bar of n  66 _ , resulting in several embedded sources , seen as ir - emission peaks in the 2.14  h@xmath0 line and the isocam lw2 band ( 5 - 8 ) .",
    "these peaks are alphabetically numbered from `` a '' to `` i '' ( contursi et al . 2000 ) , with the association ngc  346 itself coinciding with peak `` c '' .",
    "recent studies reconstruct the star formation history in nearby galactic ob associations , and provide observational evidence for sequential and triggered star formation in their vicinity .",
    "preibisch & zinnecker ( 2007 ) conclude from their study of the scorpius - centaurus ob association that the formation of whole ob subgroups ( each consisting of several thousand stars ) requires large - scale triggering mechanisms such as shocks from expanding wind and supernova driven super - bubbles surrounding older subgroups .",
    "since the low - mass stellar members of associations remain in their pms phase for  -2.truept  30  myr , they play a key rle in the understanding of star formation in the vicinity of these systems ( briceo et al .",
    "consequently , the recent discovery of a plethora of low - mass pms stars in the region of ngc  346/n  66 with photometry from the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) onboard hst ( nota et al . 2006 ; gouliermis et al . 2006 ,",
    "hereafter paper  i ) can contribute significantly to the clarification of the mechanisms that may act in this extraordinary star - forming region .",
    "the subsequent investigation of these pms stars in ngc  346/n  66 ( sabbi et al . 2007 , hereafter ssn07 ; hennekemper et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter paper  iii ) demonstrated that indeed they are clustered in several compact concentrations , some of them coinciding with the ir - emission peaks of contursi et al .",
    "( 2000 ; detected also with _ spitzer _ , see  2.1 ) , verifying the existence of stellar subgroups in the region , similarly to galactic associations .",
    "not being able to resolve differences in age smaller than 1 - 2 myr in the individual cmds of these sub - clusters , ssn07 suggest that `` all sub - clusters appear coeval with each other '' . according to these authors , this coevality is a signature of the star formation conditions predicted by the hierarchical fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud model ( klessen & burkert 2000 ; bonnell & bate 2002 ; bonnell et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "however , our analysis on the clustering properties of the pms stars in ngc  346/n  66 ( paper  iii ) showed that _ there are significant age differences between some sub - clusters and the association itself_. specifically , three compact pms clusters located to the north of the bar of n  66 are found to be not older than 2.5  myr , while the cmd of the main body of the association ngc  346 show indications of an underlying older pms population .",
    "this clearly suggests that these northern clusters are probably formed _",
    "after _ the central stellar association .",
    "as we discuss later , triggering mechanisms for star formation such as those described by models of ionization shock fronts from ob stars ( e.g. kessel - deynet & burkert 2003 ) or wind - driven shock waves ( e.g. vanhala & cameron 1998 ) may explain better their formation . indeed , while a sequential star formation mechanism has been suggested to take place _ in _ the bar of n  66 , around the association ( rubio et al . 2000 ) , the existence of young compact pms clusters _ away _ from it to the north of the association , does not quite fit in the hypothesis that this mechanism propagated from the center of n  66 along the bar .",
    "the triggering agent of these clusters may well be located outside of the bar .    in this paper",
    "we consider the findings from earlier and recent comprehensive investigations of the region ngc  346/n  66 to attempt a clearer understanding of the mechanisms that shape the recent star formation of this outstanding extragalactic star - forming region .",
    "our aim is to provide answers to two important questions : i ) _ is the star formation away from the association ngc  346 the product of triggered fragmentation of the cloud alone ? _ ii ) _ is the photo - dissociation by the early - type stars of ngc  346 in the center of n  66 the only triggering mechanism in the region ? _ in section  2 we present evidence that this region has a far more complicated recent star formation history than what was previously considered , and that the most recent star formation event could not have been triggered by the central association . in section  3",
    "we propose a scenario for the recent star formation in the northern part of the region ngc  346/n  66 and we indicate a nearby massive supernova progenitor , located at the northeast of the bar of n  66 , as the triggering agent .",
    "we also discuss the possibility that other nearby massive stars away from the association may have also contributed to this mechanism .",
    "we present supporting evidence to this scenario using analyses of massive stellar content and gas kinematics of this region .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  4 .",
    "recent _ spitzer _ ir observations of ngc  346/n  66 revealed a rich sample of embedded sources , identified as candidate young stellar objects ( ysos ; bolatto et al .",
    "2007 ; simon et al . 2007 ) .",
    "a large concentration of these sources are located in the bar of n  66 , in agreement with the distribution of the pms stars found with our acs photometry ( paper  iii ) , and they coincide with the emission peaks of this area identified by rubio et al .",
    "( 2000 ; peaks a , b , c , d , e , h and i ; see also their fig .",
    "however , another important concentration of ysos is located to the north of the bar , coinciding with two additional emission peaks ( peaks f and g ) and with a second concentration of pms stars , which forms an arc - like feature , extending from southwest to northeast . the acs image of the region in h  ( paper  iii ) , the 8  _ spitzer _ image ( simon et al .",
    "2007 ) , as well as the maps of the co(2@xmath11 ) line emission ( rubio et al . 2000 ) give further support for the existence of this feature mostly from its southern part . in co and 8-emission , which dominates its northern part",
    "the morphology of this feature is more linear , but still curved , and closer to `` arm - like '' . ] .",
    "three compact clusters of pms stars are identified by us ( paper  iii ) and ssn07 in this arc - like feature ( clusters 2a , 2b , and 3 in paper  iii , and sc-13 , 14 and 15 in ssn07 ) to coincide with both ir - emission peaks .",
    "the pms stars in these clusters are found to be younger than those of the bar , implying that they are more recently formed .",
    "moreover , this northern feature is also characterized by a high concentration of emission - line stars found with our acs photometry in h ( paper  iii ) .",
    "these facts clearly suggest that indeed star formation currently takes place in an extended feature away from the bar of n  66 , northeast of ngc  346 .",
    "this feature can be easily distinguished in the color - composite image shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "this one seems to outline the ionization front of the remaining cloud , due to the powerful winds of the ob stars of the association .",
    "however , the shape and orientation of the star - forming feature away and to the north of ngc  346 , located at the top left part of the image , suggests that it is triggered probably by the same kind of mechanism , but this process _",
    "could not be produced _ by the photo - dissociation of the cloud by the ionizing stars of the association .",
    "if it was so , this feature would not face to the east , but rather to the south in a symmetrical manner to the southern arc .",
    "since , this is not the case , the source that triggered star formation in the northern extended feature _ should not be the central association , but it should be rather located to the east of the field_.      two x - ray bright features can be seen ( in blue ) in fig .",

    "[ fig - imaxoi ] is a point source centered on the remarkable massive triple system hd  5980 , located at 00@xmath259@xmath326.55@xmath4 , @xmath1720953.8  ( j2000 ) .",

    "the high x - ray emission of hd 5980 makes it comparable to the x - ray - brightest single wn stars ( wessolowski 1996 ) and the brightest wr+ob binaries ( pollock 2002 ) of the galaxy . the nature of hd  5980",

    "danforth et al . ( 2003 ) propose a topology , according to which a roughly spherical snr is located on the near side of n  66 , basically closer to us than ngc  346 itself .",
    "consequently the rear side of the snr is propagating into relatively denser ionized nebula , while the near side is propagating through the more diffuse smc ism , and is harder to detect .",
    "the x - ray emission arises over a spherical cap , where the shock has encountered and heated the denser material , for which danforth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimate a pre - shock density of @xmath12  @xmath13 . according to these authors the remnant is not yet even halfway submerged in the n  66 material , and thus , the observed radius of x - ray emission ( as observed by naz et al .",
    "2002 and seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - imaxoi ] ) is smaller than the actual blast wave radius .",
    "hd  5980 and other uv - bright stars in the ngc  346 association are embedded within n  66 , but hd  5980 lies behind the remnant , while ngc  346 is outside the snr .",
    "danforth et al . ( 2003 ) also discuss the relationship between snr b0057@xmath1724 and n  66 , and they conclude that the detection of o  vi emission together with the h@xmath6 kinematics imply the presence of a strong shock in n  66 associated with snr b0057@xmath1724 .",
    "although this sn - driven shock affects its direct surroundings , it can not serve as the triggering mechanism of the observed star - forming event at the north of the bar of n  66 for the following reason .",
    "the expansion velocity of the snr is @xmath14 km  s@xmath9 ( danforth et al .",

    "consequently , while the relative position of the snr and the east - facing feature seems to support a relation between them ( fig .",

    "such a process has been observed in the milky way , e.g. at the periphery of the h  ii regions sh2 - 219 ( deharveng et al . 2006 ) and rcw  79 ( zavagno et al .",
    ". this mechanism may produce young compact star clusters .",
    "indeed , lee & chen ( 2007 ) presented recently their diagnosis of the rle that massive stars play in the formation of low- and intermediate - mass stars in the @xmath19  ori region , ori  ob1 , and lac  ob1 associations in the milky way .",
    "their study supports the radiation - driven implosion ( e.g. kessel - deynet & burkert 2003 ) as the triggering mechanism , where the lyman continuum photons from a luminous o star create expanding ionization fronts to evaporate and compress nearby clouds into bright - rimmed clouds .",
    "implosive pressure then causes dense clumps to collapse , prompting the formation of intermediate - mass herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars somewhat deeper in the cloud and low - mass ( t  tauri ) pms stars on the cloud surface ( i.e. , the bright rim ) .",
    "bubbles are formed by the stellar winds , not the ionization energy of massive stars .",
    "the expansion of an h  ii region ( not yet a bubble ) is caused by its higher thermal pressure due to the high temperature compared to the pre - ionized state .",
    "typical expansion velocities are around 10  km / s at temperatures @xmath20  k. on the other hand , the expansion of a bubble is driven by the thermal pressure of the shocked stellar wind in the central cavity .",
    "the velocity of this expansion ranges from 10 to 100  km / s ( drake 1986 ) , depending on the wind strength and ambient density .",
    "when the massive star explodes as a supernova , it explodes inside the bubble blown by itself during its main sequence phase , and the produced snr will have a size similar to the bubble blown by the star .",
    "this will create the picture of a snr with star formation taking place on its edge , similar to what we observe at the northern part of n  66 .",
    "however , it is the massive progenitor that triggered star formation and not the sn .",
    "the importance of stellar winds as a feedback mechanism to star formation over supernovae has been demonstrated by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who present models for the integrated output of mass , momentum , and energy from a concentration of massive stars , computed for typical starburst parameters .",
    "in general , the most massive stars evolve from the main sequence ( ms ) into blue supergiants ( bsg ) and luminous blue variables ( lbv ) to become then wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "leitherer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found that the ( post - main sequence ) ob phase , together with the wr phase is the dominant contributor to the total wind output .",
    "these authors considered the cases of an instantaneous and of a continuous starburst and they found that in both cases the lbv phase is unimportant , as a consequence of its short life time ( @xmath21  yr ; e.g. lamers 1989 ) . a total power output between @xmath22 and @xmath23  ergs  s@xmath9",
    "is estimated by these authors for a concentration of stars following a salpeter imf with masses between 1 and 120  m throughout the epoch of a continuous starburst at @xmath24  yr .",
    "considering the geometry of the north - northeastern part of the region of ngc  346/n  66 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - imaxoi ] ( _ left _ ) , the hypothesis of a wind - triggered star formation event seems to explain best the observed recent star formation in this area .",
    "we propose a scenario according to which the massive progenitor of snr  b0057@xmath1724 has triggered or contributed significantly to the triggering mechanism of star formation through its expanding bubble , producing the northern gaseous arc seen in [ o  iii ] and h. a schematic representation of this scenario is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - imaxoi ] , where the two important gaseous features , the southern part of the n  66 bar shaped by the photo - dissociation of the central ob stars and the northern feature delineating the boundary of the snr x - ray emission , are drawn with red thick curves .",
    "if indeed the star - forming northern nebular arc _ is _ related to the activity at east , it would be interesting to estimate how much mechanical energy could have been dumped in the area to produce this event .",
    "naturally the existence of hd  5980 and sk  80 in the same region with the snr may not be considered as a coincidence , and therefore one may question if the progenitor is the only triggering agent or not .",
    "indeed , the massive object hd  5980 could contribute to the triggering process through its own bubble blown during its main sequence phase , and another hypothesis is that the cumulative action of even more massive stars in the region , in addition to the sn - progenitor , may have triggered the formation of the northern extended feature .",
    "this implies the existence of a massive cluster in the area of the snr as the triggering agent . in order to test this hypothesis we used the most complete photometric catalog of bright stars in the region ( massey et al .",
    "1989 ) to search for such a cluster .",
    "the stellar chart of all bright sources in this catalog and the corresponding cmd , shown in fig .",

    "support to the lack of a star cluster of any kind in the region is also provided by the catalog of faint sources down to @xmath25  28  mag from our acs / wfc photometry of the whole ngc  346 region ( paper  i ) , where it can be seen that no specific concentration of low - mass stars exist in the area of the snr either .",

    "it could have been an originally very massive lbv which lost the last of its h and he envelopes in energetic mass ejection episodes and collapsed as a stripped wolf - rayet star .",

    "( 2007 ) reported the analysis of the most luminous sn ever recorded , the type  iin sn2006gy in ngc 1260 , which reached an absolute magnitude of @xmath26  mag .",
    "the combination of optical and x - ray monitoring suggests it was the explosion of a very massive star of about 100 m , which failed to shed its hydrogen envelope . according to these authors sn2006gy implies that some of the most massive stars can explode prematurely during the lbv phase , never becoming wolf - rayet stars .",
    "since there is no information about the nature of the progenitor of snr  b0057@xmath1727 , and in order to have an upper - limit estimation of the wind - blown energy expected by it , we may assume that this progenitor was an object as massive as the estimate of smith et al .",

    "typical ionizing photon fluxes for such stars are @xmath27  uv  photons  s@xmath9 ( vacca et al . 1996 ; schaerer & de koter 1997 ) .",
    "o - type stars have mass - loss rates @xmath28 of about @xmath29  -  @xmath30",

    "1995 ) , thus injecting large amounts of energy to the neighboring ism .",
    "the corresponding mechanical luminosity can be derived as @xmath33 ( e.g. cappa & benaglia 1998 ) .",
    "consequently , an o3-type star with a mass loss rate of @xmath30  m  yr@xmath9 and a wind velocity of 3750  km  s@xmath9 ( puls et al . 1996 ) would have a stellar wind mechanical luminosity of @xmath34  ergs  s@xmath9 .",
    "this mechanical input is lower than the assumed energy contribution of a massive cluster in the models by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , but since the density of the original cloud is unknown , one can only speculate about the energy that would be needed to trigger star formation in the region . nevertheless , the two additional energy sources in the region should be also considered .",
    "sk  80 , being an o7  i giant would contribute around @xmath35  ergs  s@xmath9 ( puls et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "hd  5980 has been suggested to be a triple system ( koenigsberger et al .",
    "2000 ) with the first component being a 50  m wn6 star , the second a 28  m wn2 ( with high uncertainty ) and the third component being a o4  -  o7 giant .",
    "koenigsberger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that a wind - wind collision shock cone winds tightly around the second companion , and using the relation given by volk & kwok ( 1985 ) , under a two - wind approximation , they provide a rough estimate of @xmath36  m  yr@xmath9 for the current mass - loss rate of the system with a terminal velocity of @xmath37  2000  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "this mass - loss rate measurement , which is higher than typical rates of galactic wr stars ( 2  -  10  @xmath38  m  yr@xmath9 with terminal velocities of 1000  -  2500  km  s@xmath9 ; van der hucht 1992 ) , yields a mechanical luminosity of @xmath39  ergs  s@xmath9 for hd  5980 .",
    "as far as the ionizing flux of hd  5980 is concerned , law et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the lyman continuum flux of wn stars appears to be independent of spectral type , and lower bound estimates tend to cluster around @xmath40  uv  photons  s@xmath9 .",
    "this would be the ionizing energy contributed by each of the wn components of hd  5980 , while the third component , being an o4  -  o7 giant , would provide an additional @xmath37  @xmath41  uv  photons  s@xmath9 .    from the mechanical luminosities of each of the involved objects in the region , one can estimate that the total mechanical power that was supposedly dumped in the region is of the order of that produced by hd  5980 alone , @xmath42  ergs  s@xmath9 , implying a small contribution from the massive progenitor of snr  b0057@xmath1724 and sk  80 in the process",
    ". however , this result stands only if the sn - progenitor did not go through a major mass - loss event . according to the standard evolution of o - type stars with masses  -2.truept  60  m",
    ", these stars will go through a wnh or lbv phase that removes via line - driven winds the remaining h - envelope to yield a  -2.truept  20  m wr star .",
    "moreover , the large number of observed giant eruptions of lbvs , which can remove around 10  m in a few years ( smith & owocki 2006 ) , clearly suggests that massive o - type stars do not shed most of their initial mass by the end of the main sequence phase , but there is still enough mass remaining to power major mass - loss during the wnh or lbv phase .",
    "indeed , recent observational evidence suggests that mass - loss rates for o stars need to be revised downward ( smith 2007 ) , in line with recent observed mass - loss rates for clumped winds ( e.g. fullerton et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "could the progenitor of snr  b0057@xmath1724 have lost most of its initial mass via an eruptive mass - loss event ( during e.g. a lbv phase ) , triggering the observed star formation ?",
    "the answer is positive .",
    "the primary star in the @xmath5  car system , which is suggested to have a present - day mass  -2.truept  100  m has lost 20  -  30  m , in violent lbv eruptions in just a few thousand years ( smith et al . 2003 ) , in addition to its steady wind .",
    "consequently a sn - progenitor alone is capable of triggering star formation event , as has been recently observed with the _ akari _ infrared satellite by koo et al .",
    "these authors report the discovery of a star - forming loop around the young , crab - like snr  g54.1 + 0.3 in the galaxy , and they propose that star formation was triggered by the progenitor star of g54.1 + 0.3 , which has a mass of  -2.truept  15 m. the triggering must have occurred near the end of the progenitor s life , possibly after it had evolved off the main sequence . under these circumstances , the massive progenitor of snr  b0057@xmath1724 alone may have provided the necessary mechanical energy to trigger star formation to the north , while the contribution of hd  5980 may have significantly enhanced this event .",
    "additional information on the interstellar environment of snr  b0057@xmath1724 can certainly be provided by the kinematic study of the surrounding gas . in fig .",

    "the central compact hconcentration in each image is the nebula n  66 and the area of the snr is directly to its left ( east ) .",
    "it is very interesting to see that from these sequential images , indeed , _",
    "a possible relation between the gas kinematics and the area of snr  b0057@xmath1724 _ is revealed through _ a gas bubble visible in the planes between 165 and 178 km  s@xmath9_. however , the hole seen in h  i seems to be much larger than the snr itself , which is about 2  in diameter ( chu & kennicutt 1988 ) .",
    "this implies that this hole should have been blown also by hd  5980 and perhaps with the help of other stars .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the location of the snr is at the edge of the h  i hole , not its center . from the quantitative point - of - view , the echelle data of chu & kennicutt ( 1988 ) indicate a systemic velocity for the snr of @xmath44  158  km  s@xmath9 , which translates to heliocentric velocity of @xmath45  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "this value _ is in very good agreement with the velocity plane where the hole in the atomic gas at the area of the snr is more clearly visible _ in the images of fig .",
    "[ fig - hi ] ( velocity of 168  km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "this result provides evidence that indeed the atomic gas _ is possibly _ kinematically related to the ionized gas and therefore possibly to the snr .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the h  i hole , seen at 168  km  s@xmath9 , is indeed a bubble . in order to clarify",
    "if this hole actually represents an h  i bubble , we examine the spatio - kinematic structure of the neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of n  66 by constructing position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams .",
    "each pv diagram consists of a east - west slice ( slit ) through the h  i data cube where we have averaged over 1  in the north - south direction .",
    "multiple pv diagrams were constructed , each after stepping sequentially by 1 in the north - south direction to cover the whole area of n  66 from east to west .",
    "twelve pv diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - hiewcuts ] , where the positions of the corresponding slits are overlayed on the maps of the area in h ( from mcels ) and h  i ( from atca and parkes ) .",
    "the vicinity of n  66 is fully covered in the h image , the features of which are easily comparable to the color - composite image of fig .  [ fig - imaxoi ] .",
    "the star - forming feature north of the bar of n  66 is also easily detectable in this map . above this feature , at slit position 07",
    ", the h  i velocity does not show any split . at slit position 08 , though , the h  i at @xmath37  170  km  s@xmath9 starts to split , and further south",
    ", this velocity split becomes more clear , giving possible evidence of an expanding shell - structure .",
    "the pv diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig - hiewcuts ] indicate an expansion velocity of @xmath37  10  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the line split does not occur over n  66 , at slit positions 08 and 09 .",
    "this indicates that n  66 does not seem to be responsible for the expanding shell .",
    "considering a distance of 60  kpc and a correction factor for he of 1.4 we integrated the h  i column density over an area roughly 12  @xmath8  12wide , centered on the shell , between velocities of 158 and 188 km  s@xmath9 and derived a total mass of 1.52  @xmath8  10@xmath46  m in the h  i expanding shell .",
    "this mass corresponds to a total kinetic energy of about 1.5  @xmath8  10@xmath47  erg .",
    "taking into account the total mechanical power estimated in   3.1 for the sn - progenitor , hd  5980 and sk  80 ( equal to 3  @xmath8  10@xmath48  erg  s@xmath9 ) , one can see that these objects have dumped a larger amount of mechanical energy than the estimated kinetic energy in the shell in less than 1  myr .",
    "indeed , it seems that it is typical for expanding bubbles that the kinetic energy retained in the shell is only a small fraction of the total stellar energy injected .",
    "this is observed for example in the superbubble n  51d in the large magellanic cloud , where the h  i kinetic energy is found to be almost an order of a magnitude lower that the total stellar wind and supernova energy input ( chu et al .",
    "2005 ) . based on our calculations of   3.1 , the total energy provided by the sn - progenitor , hd  5980 and sk  80 for the last couple myr is indeed an order of a magnitude higher than the kinetic energy in the shell",
    "in conclusion , based on the evidence presented here , we propose an expanding h  ii region or bubble blown by the winds of the massive progenitor of snr  b0057@xmath1724 , possibly the massive object hd  5980 and maybe the o7 giant sk  80 - all located at the eastern vicinity of ngc  346/n  66 , as the secondary mechanism that shapes the recent star formation in this region , in addition to the photo - ionizing process of the ob stars of the association .",
    "this mechanism is similar to shell - like h  ii regions , with a central young cluster in an evacuated cavity , and with ongoing star formation triggered around their periphery , and therefore is a rather quiescent process .",
    "typical examples for such regions in the mcs are lh  9/n  11 ( walborn & parker 1992 ) and 30 doradus ( walborn et al .",
    "2002 ) in the lmc and ngc  602/n  90 ( gouliermis et al . 2007 ; carlson et al . 2007 ) in the smc .",
    "it should be noted , however , that within the x - ray bubble associated with the snr , which most probably outlines the wind - blown bubble of its progenitor , no signature of any underlying cluster is found .",
    "the induced star formation in this part of the region of ngc  346/n  66 is evidenced by the existence of pms clusters , candidate ysos and ir - emission peaks at a projected distance @xmath37 18 pc and possibly at even larger distances from the x - ray bubble .",
    "all these objects are preferably located in an extended feature north of the bar of n  66 , which is outlined by the emission from the gas , observed in h  and [ o  iii ] , as well as from the dust , as it is seen in co , h@xmath49 and 8  maps .",
    "lee & chen ( 2007 ) findings in the @xmath19  ori region , ori  ob1 , and lac  ob1 associations suggest that intermediate - mass haebe stars are formed in the denser parts of the cloud , while the low - mass t  tauri stars are formed at the outskirts near the photo - evaporating cloud layers .",
    "our photometry in h ( paper  iii ) showed that indeed stars with h - excess ( signature of candidate haebe stars ) are located in the area of the northern compact pms clusters .",
    "based on the aforementioned observations in different wavelengths , the extended feature north of the bar of n  66 , which hosts this star formation , may be considered as part of a large arc centered on the snr ( fig .",
    "[ fig - imaxoi ] _ right _ ) , which extends also to the south and in the bar . in this case",
    ", one may conclude that its northern part is projected closer to us , outside n  66 , since the dust is well outlined by the 8  emission ( seen in red in fig .",
    "[ fig - imaxoi ] ; left ) , while its southern part is embedded _ in _ the nebula ( as suggested by the schematic of fig .",
    "[ fig - imaxoi ] ; right ) .",
    "on the other hand , considering that the northern part of this feature as seen in co and ir maps appears to be more linear with small curvature ( see e.g. maps by contursi et al .",
    "2000 ; rubio et al . 2000 ; simon et al .",
    "2007 ) , one may argue that it may not bear a morphological connection to the triggering sources to the east . against this argument",
    "stands the fact that this linearity is confined only in the northernmost part of the structure , while its southern part shows a curvature to the east , and fits very well to the alignment of emission from both gas and dust towards the south ( see e.g. maps by contursi et al .",
    "2000 ; rubio et al .",
    "2000 ; simon et al . 2007",
    "; paper  iii ) .",
    "the latter appears to be well related to the positions of the h  ii regions and ir peaks , which are located _ in _ the south - eastern part of the bar of n  66 .",
    "consequently , the northern feature can be considered to be extended to the south and to become _ embedded _ in the south - eastern part of the bar , forming a large arc - like feature , which covers the whole eastern part of n  66 nebula ( fig.[fig - imaxoi ] ) , and which is centered on the snr .",
    "further support to this argument provides the outstanding coincidence of this arc structure and the non - thermal emission related to the snr  b0057@xmath1724 , shown in the h  and continuum - subtracted images by reid et al .",
    "( 2006 ; their figures 1 and 2 ) . under these circumstances",
    "the dust emission from the northernmost linear part of the structure may not come from only a `` strip '' of molecular material , but from a whole curved surface of the wind - blown bubble , projected in front of the bar of n  66 .",
    "it should be noted , though , that an equally valid description of the morphology of the 8  emission is that of a partial arc with mild curvature pointing west , which appears connected to the n  66 bar through a clump of emission .    in any case , the proposed scenario draws the picture of a unique case of complexity in the star formation history of ngc  346/n  66 , the brightest h  ii region in the smc . according to this scenario it is the collaborative ( or competitive ) action of two major energy sources that shapes the current star formation process in this extraordinary region . the first source , located at the center of the nebula",
    "n  66 , is the bright stellar content of the association ngc  346 and affects mostly the bar of the nebula .",
    "the second source , located at the eastern part of the region , is associated with the bright x - ray bubble of a snr .",
    "we propose that the massive progenitor and possibly two other massive stellar objects have triggered the most recent star formation at the northern part of the region away from the bar of n  66 within that last few myr .",
    "observations of the gas kinematics provide further support to this hypothesis . under these circumstances ,",
    "the identified compact pms sub - clusters in the region _ can not _ all be the product of spontaneous cloud collapse and fragmentation ( see e.g. elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "they are rather the product of star formation inside _ and _ outside the bar of n  66 , induced by wind - shock waves ( e.g. vanhala & cameron 1998 ) or ionization shock fronts ( e.g. kessel - deynet & burkert 2003 ) driven by ob stars into the surrounding cloud .",
