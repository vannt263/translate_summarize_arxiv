    "( 13 ) , we notice that @xmath140 as @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , for large time ,    @xmath141    and @xmath142    the center of the bec wavepacket stops and the effective mass goes to infinity and there is an energy transfer from the kinetic energy to the internal modes , since @xmath143 is the momentum associated with the width @xmath87 .",
