    "in fact , hard ( light)quarks and gluons will be produced with high rates up to very large transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "additionally , charm and beauty quarks , which , due to their masses , would show different attenuation patterns ( see section  [ pheno ] ) , will become available for detailed measurements , since their production cross sections are expected to increase by factors 10 and 100 , respectively , from rhic to the lhc  @xcite .",

    "we will discuss how gluon fusions in this @xmath2 region are expected to affect @xmath4 ( and , to a lower extent , @xmath5 ) production , not only in  and  collisions ( nuclear shadowing ) , but possibly even in pp collisions .",
    "heavy - quark pairs , @xmath6 , are produced in partonic scatterings with large virtuality ( momentum transfer ) @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the production cross sections in  ( nn ) collisions can be calculated in the framework of collinearly factorized perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the differential @xmath8 cross section is written as : @xmath9 where the partonic @xmath10 is calculable as a power series in the strong coupling @xmath11 , which depends on the renormalization scale @xmath12 ; currently , calculations are performed up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , @xmath13 .",

    "heavy - quark medium - induced quenching is one of the most captivating topics to be addressed in  collisions at the lhc , where both c and b quarks will be produced with high rates ( see table  [ tab : xsec ] ) . due to the qcd nature of parton energy loss , quarks",
    "are predicted to lose less energy than gluons ( that have a higher colour charge ) and , in addition , the ` dead - cone effect ' is expected to reduce the energy loss of massive quarks  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should observe a pattern of gradually decreasing @xmath19 suppression when going from gluon - originated light - flavour hadrons ( @xmath20 ) to d and to b mesons : @xmath21 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] we report recent estimates of these quantities for central  collisions at the lhc  @xcite , obtained in the framework of a model  @xcite where energy loss is simulated in a parton - by - parton approach combining the bdmps ` quenching weights '  @xcite and a glauber - model - based definition of the in - medium parton path length . for c and b quarks , the quenching weights were specifically calculated using the formalism developed in  @xcite .",
    "the bdmps transport coefficient ( a measure of the medium density ) at the lhc was set to the value @xmath22 , estimated on the basis of the analysis of rhic data performed in  @xcite .",
    "the results are plotted as bands that represent the theoretical uncertainty  @xcite . for charged hadrons ,",
    "@xmath19 is given for @xmath23 because at lower @xmath1 the soft - particle component produced from the radiated gluons , which is not implemented in the model , might strongly contribute in shaping the nuclear modification factor . whereas for d and b mesons @xmath19 can be calculated down to @xmath24 by assigning a ` thermal ' transverse momentum ( according to @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) to the c and b quarks that lose most of their initial energy in the medium  @xcite .",
    "the presence of this thermalized component determines the rise of @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that , in the low @xmath1 region , the hadronization of heavy quarks in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions is likely to happen inside the medium via parton recombination  @xcite , thus producing deviations from the simple pattern obtained from the aforementioned thermalization assumption .",
    "three experiments will participate in the lhc heavy - ion program : alice , the dedicated heavy - ion experiment  @xcite ; cms , with a strong heavy - ion program  @xcite ; ( most probably ) atlas , which recently expressed interest in participating  @xcite .",
    "the three detectors have different features and design requirements , but all of them are expected to have excellent capabilities for heavy - flavour measurements .",
    "their complementarity will provide a very broad coverage in terms of phase - space , decay channels and observables .    experimentally , the two key elements for a rich heavy - flavour program are : tracking / vertexing and particle identification ( pid ) .",
    "open charm and beauty mesons have typical life - times of few hundred microns ( @xmath29 values are about @xmath30@xmath31 for d mesons and @xmath32 for b mesons ) and the most direct detection strategy is the identification of single tracks or vertices that are displaced from the interaction vertex .",
    "the detector capability to perform this task is determined by the impact parameter ( @xmath33 ) resolution .",

    "[ fig : ptd0 ] we show the @xmath33 resolution of alice and cms , along with the @xmath1 resolution , which is another important ingredient for heavy - flavour measurements ( e.g. it determines the invariant mass resolution ) .",
    "the main difference between the two experiments is given by the magnetic field values : alice ( 0.4  t ) has a very low @xmath1 cutoff of @xmath36 , while cms ( 4  t ) has a higher cutoff of @xmath37 but better @xmath1 resolution at high @xmath1 .",

    "d and b mesons have relatively - large branching ratios ( br ) in the semi - leptonic channels , @xmath41 to electrons and @xmath41 to muons , and inclusive cross - section measurements can be performed via single leptons or di - leptons .",
    "alice can identify electrons with @xmath42 and @xmath34 , via transition radiation and @xmath43 measurements , and muons in the forward region , @xmath44 , which allows a very low @xmath1 cutoff of @xmath37 .",

    "both cms and atlas have high - resolution electro - magnetic calorimeters that can be used to identify electrons , although performance studies for heavy - ion collisions have not been carried out yet .",
    "semi - leptonic inclusive measurements do not provide direct information on the d(b)-meson @xmath1 distribution , especially at low @xmath1 , because of the weak correlation between the lepton and meson momenta .",
    "therefore , for charm in particular , the reconstruction of exclusive ( hadronic ) decays is preferable . in this case , in a high - multiplicity environment",
