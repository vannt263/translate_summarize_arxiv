    "it is generated by the elements @xmath2 , @xmath3 , representing one full positive twist between the @xmath4-th and the @xmath5-th strands with all the remaining strands of the braid being strictly vertical and placed behind these two : @xmath6{x_ij.eps}}\\ ] ] defining relation between these generators can be found , for instance , in @xcite ; we will not need them here .",
    "there is a semi - direct decomposition @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a free group on @xmath9 generators , implemented in our case as the subgroup of @xmath0 generated by the set @xmath10 .",
    "this decomposition assures that any pure braid can be uniquely written in the _ combed form _",
    "@xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "where @xmath13 are arbitrary nonzero integers and in this product no two identical generators follow each other ( that is , the word is reduced ) .    the _ magnus expansion _ is a map from @xmath0 into the @xmath14-algebra of formal power series in @xmath15 non - commuting variables @xmath16 , @xmath3 , defined by @xmath17 if @xmath11 is the combed form of the braid @xmath18 . here",
    "the negative powers are understood as usual , according to the rule @xmath19 ,  this is why we need power series , not just polynomials , in the construction of @xmath20 .",
    "* example . * to compute the value @xmath21 , we first find the combed form of this braid @xmath22 and then write : @xmath23    from a broader perspective , it makes sense to consider the codomain of the mapping @xmath20 as the completed quotient of the algebra @xmath24 $ ] over the ideal generated by the elements @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] where all indices are supposed to be distinct and @xmath27 is understood as @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "we denote this algebra by @xmath30 and view its generating monomials as horizontal chord diagrams on @xmath1 vertical strands ( each variable @xmath16 represents a chord connecting the @xmath4-th and @xmath5-th strands ; the product of variables is understood as vertical concatenation from top to bottom ) .",

    "the set of descending chord diagrams forms a basis of the free abelian group @xmath30 ( see @xcite , sec .",
    "3 - 2 ) , therefore we have a module isomorphism @xmath36 .    by an _",
    "invariant of braids _",
    ", we understand any mapping from the braid group @xmath0 into an arbitrary set  we are interested only in its invariance under the braid isotopy , tacitly assumed in the definition of @xmath0 , and not in the invariance under the renumbering of strands etc .",
    "for pure braids , just like in the classical case of knots , one can define the notion of finite type ( vassiliev ) invariants , see @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the magnus expansion truncated to any degree @xmath37 is a vassiliev invariant of order @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the following theorem holds :    ( @xcite ) the mapping @xmath38 is a universal finite type invariant of pure braids in the sense that for any degree @xmath37 invariant @xmath39 there exists a map @xmath40 vanishing on all monomials of degree greater than @xmath37 and such that @xmath41 .",
    "* remark.*[magnus_gen ] in fact , one may define a universal finite type invariant of pure braids by sending each @xmath2 in the combed form into @xmath42 where @xmath43 are any nonzero constants and @xmath44 are arbitrary series starting with degree greater than one .",
    "a remarkable instance of this construction ( with values in @xmath45 ) is provided by the kontsevich integral ( @xcite ) .",
    "its advantage over the usual magnus expansion consists in multiplicativity ; however , the definition of the kontsevich integral is much more involved and its computation much more difficult ; moreover , its value depends on the placement of the endpoints of the braid .",
    "for example , the kontsevich integrals of the generating braids of the group @xmath46 , where the strand endpoints are collinear and equidistant , are infinite series with the following terms up to degree 2 : @xmath47+\\dots,\\\\    i(x_{13 } ) & = & 1-c+\\frac{1}{2}c^2+\\frac{1}{2}[a , b]+\\dots,\\\\    i(x_{23 } ) & = & 1-b+\\frac{1}{2}b^2+\\frac{i\\ln2}{2\\pi}[c , a]+\\dots,\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and we remind that @xmath49=[b , c]=[c , a]$ ] according to the definition of @xmath50 .",
    "the reader may wish , by way of exercise , to check that these relations agree with the commutation relations in the group @xmath46 ( expressed by the fact that the element @xmath51 is central , see @xcite ) .",
    "alongside with the ordinary ( artin ) closure which turns braids into links , there is another operation of closing pure braids into oriented knots , called _ short - circuit closure _ , see @xcite .",
    "it is defined by connecting pairwise by short arcs the upper endpoints number @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the lower endpoints number @xmath54 and @xmath52 thus obtaining a long knot with two loose endpoints . attaching an additional arc ,",
    "one obtains a conventional compact knot .",
    "orientation is chosen so that the leftmost strand of the braid is oriented downwards .",
    "for example : @xmath55{scc1.eps}}\\ \\longmapsto\\    { \\raisebox}{-10mm}{{\\includegraphics}[width=25mm]{scc2.eps}}\\ \\longmapsto\\   { \\raisebox}{-6mm}{{\\includegraphics}[width=13mm]{scc3.eps}}\\ .\\ ] ] ( the non - oriented version of this operation , called _ plat closure _ , was earlier introduced and studied by j.  birman @xcite . )",
    "it is easy to see that the short - circuit closures of braids with different number of strands are consistent with the inclusions @xmath56 ( adding a vertical strand on the right ) , so that we obtain a well - defined map @xmath57 from the group @xmath58 to the set of oriented knots @xmath59 .",
    "a theorem of mostovoy and stanford asserts that this map is onto and that it identifies @xmath59 with double cosets of the group @xmath60 over two special subgroups , see @xcite .    in the particular case",
    "@xmath61 , the image of @xmath62 coincides with the set of all 2-bridge ( rational ) knots ( see @xcite for an introduction to rational knots ) . indeed",
    ", the short - circuit closure of the braid @xmath63 , respectively @xmath64 , where all @xmath65 , @xmath66 are non - zero integers , is the rational knot corresponding to the continuous fraction with denominators @xmath67 respectively , @xmath68 now , a simple number - theoretic argument shows that any rational number with an odd denominator ( those corresponding to knots , not links ) has a continuous fraction of this kind ( the last number is odd , while all the previous ones are even ) .",
    "by taking composition with the short - circuit closure , any invariant of knots can be converted into an invariant of braids .",
    "for example , the conway polynomial of knots @xmath69 $ ] induces an invariant of pure braids @xmath70 $ ] ( the conway polynomial of braids ) . for every @xmath37 , the coefficient of @xmath71 in this polynomial is a vassiliev invariant of degree @xmath72 . by the universality of the magnus expansion , there is a mapping ( the `` symbol '' of the conway polynomial ) @xmath73 $ ] such that @xmath74 .",
    "we succeeded in finding an explicit description of the symbol only for pure braids on 3 strands .",
