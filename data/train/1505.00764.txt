    "epithelial cells become polarized perpendicular to the substrate . at this point , they no longer produce lamellipodia and filopodia , but instead reorganize their actin into a belt located near their apical side ( see fig .",

    "@xcite challenged the textbook view that @xmath1-catenin mechanically links the adhesion complex to the underlying actin cytoskeleton .",
    "they showed that @xmath1-catenin exists either as a monomer or as a dimer , and that the domain on an @xmath1-catenin monomer that binds to @xmath0-catenin and the one that binds to another @xmath1-catenin monomer overlap .",
    "therefore , the formations of @xmath1-catenin dimers and @xmath1-catenin-@xmath0-catenin complexes are mutually exclusive  @xcite .",

    "it has recently been proposed that an excess expansion pressure could be a characteristic trait of neoplastic tissues  @xcite .",
    "a breakdown of the regulation mechanism discussed above might therefore lead to tumorigenesis .",
    "it is indeed well - known that the e - cadherin-@xmath0-catenin-@xmath1-catenin adhesion complex plays an important role in carcinomas  @xcite . a reduced expression of e - cadherins  for example due to dna hypermethylation ",
    "is associated with a loss of cellular polarity and the acquisition of invasive characteristics  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that overexpression and reduced degradation of @xmath0-catenins also leads to cellular transformations that result in the cell s ability to grow in soft agarose gels and to overproliferate at high cell densities @xcite .",
    "along the same lines , in cells that have undergone the epithelial - mesenchymal transition , e - cadherin expression is downregulated while the production of @xmath0-catenin is increased  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the growth - inhibiting activity of e - cadherin is counteracted by an increased @xmath0-catenin activity  @xcite . finally , the concentration of @xmath0-catenins is regulated by the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) protein , a tumor suppressor protein that is known to label @xmath0-catenin for degradation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0-catenin - null cells show an unaffected or even decreased rate of expansion and proliferation  @xcite . as the important role of e - cadherin and @xmath0-catenin in the progression of cancer has been well studied , several papers report that the loss of @xmath1-catenin is an important prognostic factor for cancer , as reviewed in benjamin and nelson  @xcite . for example",

    "important progress has been made in this direction by drees and coworkers  @xcite , who proposed a picture in which cell - cell contact leads to an accumulation of e - cadherin-@xmath0-catenin-@xmath1-catenin complexes at the adhesion sites .",
    "they propose that the release of @xmath1-catenin monomers from these complexes into the cytoplasm provide an increase in @xmath1-catenin dimer concentration , favoring actin bundling and downregulating actin assembly and branching . in the present work ,",
    "we propose a model for the e - cadherin-@xmath0-catenin-@xmath1-catenin function that is based on a reaction - diffusion system .",
    "we show that the interplay between these three proteins results in a pathway for contact inhibition that downregulates actin polymerization in response to cell - cell contact .",
    "our mechanism relies on the fact that the binding of @xmath0-catenin to @xmath1-catenin limits @xmath1-catenin dimerization in the cytosol .",
    "when @xmath0-catenin - e - cadherin complexes are recruited to the cell membrane due to cell - cell contact , the cytosolic concentration of @xmath0-catenin drops and @xmath1-catenin dimerization can take place . according to the work by the nelson and weis group  @xcite , this in turn prevents",
    "arp2/3-based actin branching and cause the cell to enter a quiescent state .",

    "minus signs indicate either decreased concentrations or complete impairment of the associated proteins , and plus signs indicate increased concentrations as compared with the healthy cell state . ]",
    "its main feature is that @xmath1-catenin-@xmath0-catenin binding competes with @xmath1-catenin dimerization : at high cytosolic concentrations of @xmath0-catenins , the majority of @xmath1-catenins enters @xmath1-catenin-@xmath0-catenin complexes . at low cytosolic concentrations of @xmath0-catenins",
    "however , @xmath1-catenins form dimers almost exclusively  @xcite . therefore",
    ", the organization and activity of the actin cortex of the cell depends on the presence of a neighboring cell by the following mechanism : it is known that @xmath0-catenin quickly binds to e - cadherin after production at the golgi apparatus of the cell  @xcite .",
    "when the cell is in its growth phase , e - cadherin-@xmath0-catenin complexes are mostly found in vesicles in the cytoplasm  @xcite , effectively creating a large concentration of @xmath0-catenin complexes in the cytosol .",
    "these complexes further recruit most of the @xmath1-catenin monomers that are present in the cytoplasm , letting actin binding sites free for arp2/3 complexes to bind .",
    "the structure of the actin cortex is therefore branched , and its activity is high .",
    "in contrast , when contact with a neighboring cell is established , the e - cadherins bind to the neighboring cell and accumulate at the membrane , effectively lowering their concentration in the cytosol  @xcite .",
    "since a large fraction of e - cadherins is bound to @xmath0-catenins , the establishment of cell - cell contacts also induces a redistribution of @xmath0-catenins to the plasma membrane .",
    "indeed , the potent ability of e - cadherin to recruit @xmath0-catenin to the cell membrane has been observed in vivo  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0-catenin redistribution to the plasma membrane in turn favors the formation of @xmath1-catenin dimers in the cytosol , which further favors actin bundling rather than actin branching and polymerization .",
    "note that other protein complexes could play a similar role as e - cadherins and transport @xmath0-catenin proteins to the cell membrane upon cell - cell contact , as it has been proposed recently  @xcite . in any case",
    ", the cell switches from an active state with high actin branching and polymerization activity when there is no cell - cell contact , to a passive state characterized by a reduced actin activity after cell - cell contact has been established .      to model the cadherin - catenin system described above in a quantitative manner",

    "this quantity is plotted as a function of the @xmath1-catenin influx @xmath106 ( a ) , of the @xmath0-catenin degradation rate in the cytoplasm @xmath13 ( b ) and of the unbinding and binding rates of the @xmath0-catenin protein complex off and on the membrane @xmath29 ( c ) and @xmath28 ( d ) .",
    "the same constants are used as in fig .",
    "[ fig_conc ] . in b ,",
    "@xmath107 is assumed .",
    "contact inhibition occurs when the concentration of @xmath1-catenin dimers @xmath108 is large .",
    "the contact - inhibition breaks down for low production @xmath106 of @xmath1-catenin ( a ) and for an increased degradation of @xmath0-catenin ( b ) .",
    "it also breaks down for an increased membrane off - rate ( c ) , which corresponds to mutations of e - cadherins leading to less efficient formation of cell - cell e - cadherin bonds .",
    "this results in an insufficient trapping of @xmath0-catenins on the membrane in the presence of cell - cell contact .",
    "finally , contact inhibition breaks down for small values of @xmath28 ( d ) , which could correspond to a less efficient binding of @xmath0-catenin to the membrane due to a decreased expression of e - cadherins . ]",
    "we first show the dependence on @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_break ]  a ) , which is proportional to the total production of @xmath1-catenin in the cell golgi apparatus . as discussed above ,",
    "many cancerous cells show mutations impairing the function or production of @xmath1-catenin proteins . from eq .",
    "[ ndimers ] , we see that the total amount of @xmath1-catenin dimers scales like @xmath109 , which is consistent with these experimental observations . for low values of @xmath19 , the difference between the contact - free and contact - inhibited state disappears , as it has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the effect of a knockout of the apc protein , which is known to label the @xmath0-catenin in the cytosol for degradation . from eqs .",
    "[ beta0 ] , [ f&g ] , and [ ndimers ] , we see that for a fast @xmath0-catenin degradation , the total amount of @xmath1-catenin dimers scales like @xmath110 .",
    "hence , contact inhibition becomes less effective for a lower cytosolic @xmath0-catenin degradation rate , as it has been observed in experiments  @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_break ]  b , a low degradation rate of @xmath0-catenin  which corresponds to a knockout of apc  leads to a total concentration of @xmath1-catenin dimers in the cell that is low , even when there is cell - cell contact .",
    "other defects frequently encountered for cancerous cells are downregulation or mutations of e - cadherins @xcite . in our picture",
    ", a malfunction of e - cadherins due to mutations corresponds to a less effective binding of e - cadherins to neighboring cells , and thereby a less efficient trapping of e - cadherins and @xmath0-catenins to the plasma membrane .",
    "[ fig_break ]  c shows that an increased off - rate @xmath90 in both states again leads to a failure of contact inhibition , since the difference between the contact and no - contact states disappears for large values of @xmath90 in the contact state . finally ,",
    "a lower expression of e - cadherin results in a less effective binding of @xmath0-catenin to the plasma membrane , which can be modeled by a decreased on - rate @xmath111 , as shown in fig .  [ fig_break ]  d. similar results are obtained when @xmath55 is the shortest length scale in the system . in this case , the solution of the system of equations is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_0d ] as a function of the model parameters that simulate a breakdown of the contact inhibition mechanism .",
    "the breakdown of the switch is similar to the one discussed above .",
    "in this article , we have proposed a reaction - diffusion model of the cadherin - catenin system in which the concentration of @xmath1-catenin dimers increases in a confluent cell as compared to a cell without contact .",
    "we propose that this switch is due to a competition between mutually exclusive @xmath1-catenin dimerization and @xmath1-catenin - to-@xmath0-catenin binding in the cytosol of the cell . in the presence of cell - cell contact ,",
    "intercellular e - cadherin bonds prevent endocytosis of e - cadherin complexes .",
    "this leads to a redistribution of unbound @xmath0-catenins to the cell membrane and thereby a significant increase in the amount of @xmath1-catenin dimerization .",
    "hence , the cell shifts between an active state combining high cellular expansion pressure with high cellular motility , to a quiescent state , where actin branching is inhibited .    from our analysis",
    ", we expect the contact inhibition switch to function efficiently if @xmath0-catenin is sufficiently abundant in the cell to effectively compete with @xmath1-catenin dimerization",
    ". therefore , there are three distinct possibilities that can lead to a functioning contact inhibition mechanism .",
    "first , the protein reaction rates could be sufficiently fast compared with protein diffusion to effectively separate two distinct pools of @xmath0-catenin proteins , respectively cytosolic and membrane - bound @xmath0-catenins ( both linked to e - cadherin proteins ) .",
    "while @xmath0-catenins in the cytosol compete with @xmath1-catenin dimerization , @xmath0-catenins on the membrane can not react with @xmath1-catenins anymore , because all @xmath1-catenins either bind @xmath0-catenins or form dimers before they get a chance to arrive at the membrane . in that case",
    ", the contact inhibition switch comes from a redistribution of @xmath0-catenin - e - cadherin complexes from the cytosol toward the cell membrane as a response to contact with a neighboring cell , effectively letting @xmath1-catenin dimers form in the cytosol before reaching the cell membrane , where a high concentration of @xmath0-catenin proteins is found .",
    "second , the contact - inhibition switch could arise from depletion of @xmath0-catenins from the entire cell in the state with contact as compared to the state without contact .",
    "this is case for example if the degradation rate of @xmath0-catenin is much larger on the membrane than it is in the cytosol , which is possible since @xmath0-catenin degradation takes place via two distinct pathways in the cytosol and on the membrane of the cell . in this case",
    ", the mechanism works even for very slow reaction rates and fast protein diffusion , and the spatial structure of the cell can then be ignored or be treated as a zero - dimensional system .",
    "this case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_0d ] .",
    "third , the switch could arise from a reaction of membrane - bound @xmath0-catenin with @xmath1-catenin much slower than the corresponding reaction rate in the cytosol . depending on the state of the cell , @xmath0-catenin proteins",
    "are indeed located primarily either on the plasma membrane or in the cytosol , allowing @xmath1-catenin proteins to dimerize or not .",
    "this case also does not rely on slow diffusion and can be treated as a zero - dimensional system .",
    "in addition to providing a mechanism for contact inhibition , the model qualitatively reproduces the effect of several mutations that are known to cause the breakdown of this mechanism and result in tumor - like phenotypes . as we have seen from figs .",
    "[ fig_0d ] and [ fig_break ] , the model agrees with experimental observations in which the expression level or the degradation rate of either e - cadherin , @xmath0-catenin or @xmath1-catenin are modified .",
    "these findings explain why a broad range of mutations leads to similar cancerous phenotypes .",
    "in particular , the effects of an increased @xmath0-catenin concentration on contact inhibition are explained by this model without implicating the wnt - signaling pathway  @xcite .    while this work shows that the cadherin - catenin reaction - diffusion system could play the role of a contact inhibition switch , it is impossible to determine whether it is the most relevant effect without further experimental studies .",
    "experiments that would directly test this pathway are possible . we have already discussed how the cadherin - catenin mechanism reproduces the observed effects of a change in the production and degradation rates of different proteins .",
    "however , it might also be possible to only inhibit the interaction of any given pair of these proteins by phosphorylation of specific residues , and thereby directly investigate every step in the proposed mechanism without interfering with other pathways like the wnt - signaling pathway  @xcite .",
    "for example , one experiment of particular interest would be to knockout @xmath0-catenin - to-@xmath1-catenin binding by phosphorylation without changing the level of expression of these proteins .",
    "this would distinguish our model from the picture proposed by nelson et al .",
    "@xcite : indeed , within the reaction - diffusion model presented here , such a treatment would result in an increased concentration of @xmath1-catenin dimers , the inhibition of actin branching and thus the contact - inhibited cell state even in the absence of a neighboring cell .",
    "in contrast , in the picture proposed by nelson et al . , failure of @xmath0-catenin to bind to @xmath1-catenin would lead to a disruption of the localization of @xmath1-catenin to the adhesion sites , and thereby to actin branching and polymerization even at confluence .",
    "if the model presented here were to be confirmed experimentally , it could potentially ground the idea that different homeostatic growth pressures between neoplastic and healthy tissues are responsible for tumor growth  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one could then test whether different disruptions of the cadherin - catenin pathway that are known to lead to tumorigenesis would affect the homeostatic pressure growths of the tissues under study .",
    "such an observation could potentially give a direct explanation of the observed link between the cadherin - catenin system and neoplastic phenotypes .",
