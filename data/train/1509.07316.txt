    "recently , whispering gallery microcavities have stimulated a variety of applications , including sensor @xcite , microlaser @xcite , frequency comb @xcite , optomechanics @xcite , and cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "because of the very high q - factor to mode volume ratio , light in the microcavity would generate very strong local electromagnetic field and enhance the light - matter interaction",
    ". therefore , a perturbation of environment , such as refractive index change @xcite , tiny nanoparticle binding / debinding @xcite , and variation of temperature @xcite or pressure @xcite , will changes the properties of the optical resonance . for low input - power where the nonlinear effects can be neglected , the responses of cavity to external perturbation are frequency shift and linewidth change . to sense the perturbation , probe light are coupled to the cavity through free - space or near field coupler , and the lorentz lineshapes in transmittance are monitored when sweeping the laser frequency through the resonance . from the change of central frequency and linewidth , and given the properties of the material of the microcavity , we can tell how the environment changes with high sensitivity .    currently , most microcavity sensors are based on probing the steady state transmission or reflection spectra by sweeping the frequency of probe laser slowly . because the scanning speed ( in unit of @xmath0 ) usually below the character speed ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the decay rate ) of a microcavity , the former steady state assumption works well",
    "nevertheless , the sensor depended on steady state is limited by its low temporal resolution @xcite , so it can not detect high speed dynamic procedure directly .",
    "for instance , thermal dissipation in a microcavity is realized as a phenomenon happening in @xmath3 ms which breaks the steady state assumption @xcite .",
    "moreover , a ringing transmission spectrum caused by a high scanning speed laser can be used in experiment to distinguish over coupling case from the under coupling one @xcite .",
    "furthermore , binding / unbinding events included in sensing of nanoparticle are transient processes themselves which arouses ringing transmission spectrum too @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , there is a lack of a general research focusing on the transient response of a microcavity in sensing .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically study the transient response of high - q microcavity .",
    "meanwhile , two transient sensing schemes relying on the temporal response of microcavity is proposed , their properties and limitations are also studied . as an examples of application ,",
    "the nanoparticle motion sensors based on microtoroid cavity is studied , with two different scenarios , i.e. particle adhering to the cavity wall and particle passing by it .",
    "the transient response studied here is not restricted to the wgm .",
    "the principle can also be applied to other types of microcavities , such as photonic crystal cavity @xcite and fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) schematic illustration of microcavity sensor for nanoparticle detection . a silica microtoroid is coupling with a silica fiber taper , with laser being loaded from one port and transmitted light being collected from the other .",
    "( b ) typical quasi - static transmission spectrum of whispering gallery mode , with the laser frequency sweeping speed @xmath4 where the character sweeping speed is @xmath5 . ( c ) a transient transmission spectrum for fast scanning laser , with @xmath6 .",
    "time normalized with @xmath7.,width=226 ]    figure [ fig : a - microcavity - sensor.](a ) shows a typical microcavity sensor composed of a toroid microcavity and a tapered fiber @xcite .",
    "a probe light is guided in the single mode tapered fiber , and coupled with the high - q whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) in the microcavity through evanescent field .",
    "when there is variation of the environment , such as the nanoparticle approaching or leaving the microcavity , the intrinsic loss and resonant frequency of the wgms will be disturbed .",
    "then , the phase and amplitude of the cavity field will change accordingly .",
    "the electric field component of input light generally reads @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the square root of @xmath10 .",
    "the phase @xmath11 is the integral of instant angular frequency @xmath12 about time @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath15 of wgm field can be solved by the coupled mode theory @xcite @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the angular frequency and intrinsic loss rate of photons , which are determined by the material and the geometry of the microcavity .",
    "the @xmath19 is external loss of photons cause by the fiber taper , which can be controlled by adjusting the relative location of fiber taper in respect to the microcavity .",
    "denote the total decay rate of the field amplitude as @xmath20 , and hence the total quality factor @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the total amplitude lifetime of photons in the mode is @xmath22 .    in experiments ,",
    "the laser amplitude is fixed to reduce the noises induced by amplitude fluctuation in sensor application , thus @xmath23 is a constant . for monochrome light with fixed laser frequency",
    ", @xmath11 increases with time @xmath13 linearly , i.e. @xmath24 , we obtain the steady state solution as @xmath25 the cavity field approaches the steady state with the build - up time in the order of @xmath26 . for the wgm",
    ", there is another time scale @xmath27 , which is the round trip time corresponding to the period that a pulse travels around the perimeter of a microcavity . in high @xmath28 microcavity , the @xmath29 is satisfied , which implies that photons travel thousands of times in the microcavity before they lost .",
    "the high sensitivity of microcavity sensor benefits from this repeated travels .",
    "furthermore , we assume the time scales of all interactions is much longer than the @xmath27 , so the eq.@xmath30([eq : coupling ] ) is always true .    in practice ,",
    "the transmission spectrum are obtained by sweeping the frequency of the probe laser .",
    "for example , a linear frequency scanning @xmath31 ( in the following , the scanning speeds is defined in terms of the angular frequency ) is usually employed , then @xmath32 a general solution of eq.@xmath30([eq : coupling ] ) reads @xmath33.\\label{eq : solution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so long as we know the function @xmath11 , the cavity field @xmath15 can be solved accurately by eq.@xmath30([eq : solution ] ) . for the linear scanning case [ eq.@xmath30([eq : linear ] ) ] , the equation can be solved analytically @xcite . for more general cases with nonlinear scanning ,",
    "@xmath15 should be solved numerically .",
    "the transmission signal @xmath34 corresponding to the interference of the directly - transmitted input laser and cavity output in the tapered fiber .",
    "the intensity of transmitted signal ( @xmath35 ) is collected and monitored by a high - speed photon detector in real - time . for convenience ,",
    "people measure the intensity spectrum of output signal normalized by input signal @xmath36 to gather information from spectrum of intensity , but the phase information can not be obtained without interferometer which requires complex stabilization equipments .        here",
    ", we introduce the character speed @xmath37 , which corresponds to the speed that the laser sweep through the cavity resonance ( frequency range @xmath38 ) within the lifetime of the mode @xmath39 . when the scanning speed @xmath40 , the transmission shows the typical symmetry lorentz spectrum , as shown in fig.@xmath30[fig : a - microcavity - sensor.](b ) for critical coupling where @xmath41 . in this case",
    ", the transient response of the wgm can be neglected and the field amplitude can be approximated by the steady state solution ( eq.@xmath30([eq : tss ] ) ) . however , in eq.@xmath30([eq : t(t ) ] ) the information about the phase of the transmitted light is lost , and we can not distinguish between the under- and over - coupling since the roles of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eq.@xmath30([eq : tss ] ) are identical .",
    "then , we can not distinguish the change of the intrinsic cavity loss due to the sensing event from the change of the external cavity loss due to vibration of tapered fiber .",
    "for fast sweeping speed that @xmath42 is comparable with or even larger than @xmath43 , the transient response of the cavity field can not be omitted .",
    "for instance , the spectrum of @xmath6 is shown in fig.@xmath30[fig : a - microcavity - sensor.](c ) , where other parameters are the same with fig.@xmath30[fig : a - microcavity - sensor.](b ) .",
    "as firstly pointed out in ref.@xmath30@xcite , the information of @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be extracted from the transient response deterministically .",
    "it can be understood intuitively that the coupled microcavity and fiber taper system becomes a heterodyne interferometer for transient sensor . due to the high - q wgm , there is a hysteresis between the input light and cavity output light , or we can say the light emitted from the cavity is actually the light input from the fiber a while ago .",
    "when @xmath42 is large , the detected light is the interference between lights of different frequencies , thus it contains both the amplitude and phase information of the cavity field .",
    "in general , there are two ways to monitor the variation of cavity resonance .",
    "one is sweeping the laser frequency quickly and repeatedly .",
    "the frequency @xmath12 is a linear function with time , then the phase @xmath11 is a quadratic function of time .",
    "since each frequency sweeping takes a repetition time @xmath44 , we can refresh the information of environment at digital time @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is an integer ) .",
    "the other approach is locking the laser frequency precisely , and then monitoring the change of transmitted signal due to the change of resonant frequency . in the later case",
    ", the relevant @xmath14 is very complicated , which is determined by the history of the variation of environment . for both cases , the principle and applied theory are the same with those described in previous section .",
    "the resonant frequency of a cavity can be characterized by monitoring the position of dip in transmission spectrum of steady state in experience .",
    "in addition , relying on the transient response analysis , people has figured out how to get @xmath19 and @xmath18 from the parameter fitting method @xcite . here",
    ", we provide a direct way to determine the coupling rates by the features of transmission curves @xmath47 in transient states . to show the results quantitatively , we choose the following parameters which are reasonable in experiments : resonant wavelength @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the critical sweep speed for such high - q cavity with critical coupling is @xmath50 .",
    "when the frequency of the input signal scans fast ( e.g. @xmath51 ) through a resonant frequency of the microcavity , an asymmetry dip followed with a ringing tail is the typical shape of @xmath47 ( fig.@xmath30[fig : fig2](a ) ) , in contrast to a simple symmetry lorenz lineshape dip of @xmath47 in steady state assumption . because of the transient process that light builds up inside the cavity , the dip bottom in on - resonance moment does not reach @xmath52 .",
    "the ringing tail is the result of interference between back coupled wgm light and the transmitted signal light . besides , for a system being free from nonlinear effect @xcite , if the input signal scans downward ( @xmath53 ) through the resonant frequency , the transmission curve is the same in time sequence as it scans upward .",
    "the analytical solution of the integral in eq.@xmath30([eq : solution ] ) can be written as @xcite @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55^{2}}{2v_{s}}}\\mathrm{erf}(\\frac{j\\kappa+\\omega_{i}-\\omega_{in}-v_{s}t}{\\sqrt{2jv_{s}}})\\ ] ] and @xmath56 is the complex error function .",
    "the transmission curve can be characterized by four parameters : peak height , peak width , dip depth and dip width [ fig.@xmath30[fig : fig2](a ) ] , where peak width is the full width of half maximum of the first peak , dip width is the full width of half minimum of the first dip .",
    "varying @xmath18 and @xmath19 and fixing @xmath57 , these parameters are extracted , and are plotted in figs.@xmath30[fig : fig2](b ) and ( c ) . noting that the absolute position of the dip is not shown here , which corresponding to the shift of cavity resonance , because it can be determined in experiment precisely with the help of another reference cavity .",
    "if both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are large enough to make @xmath58 ( top right of fig.@xmath30[fig : fig2](b ) ) , it is the quasi - steady state where the dip depth depends on the ratio @xmath59 . when @xmath60 , the dip depth is around @xmath61 corresponding to the critical coupling .",
    "however , when decreasing the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 , the critical coupling deviates from the line @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath18 is small ( lower half of fig.@xmath30[fig : fig2](b ) ) the dip depth mainly depends on @xmath19 , and the extreme value of dip depth appears near the @xmath62 .",
    "it is because that when @xmath63 , the critical coupling for transient response requires @xmath64 to make energy enter the cavity more efficiently and afterwards destructively interference with the input light , leads to a cancelation of transmission .",
    "however , if the @xmath19 is too large , the energy of cavity couples back to tapered fiber faster , thus break the balance and give non - zero transmission .",
    "so , as analogue to the steady state critical coupling , the certain @xmath19 give rise to temporal critical coupling that dip depth be unitary .    in both figs.@xmath30[fig : fig2](b ) and ( c ) , in the transient region that @xmath65 , the contours of the width and height of peak and the width and depth of dip cross , respectively . therefore",
    ", the transient transmission provides extra information from which we can determine the value of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for example , if a coupling system has a transmission curve with a dip depth of @xmath66 and dip width of @xmath67 , it may in over or under coupling region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) . then check the peak width , assume @xmath68 to obtain the value of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . there",
    "even exists other redundant feature ( peak height ) to double check the result .",
    "therefore , combining with the measured location of the resonance , we can estimate the instant frequency and decay rate of the wgm for sensing purpose .    more generally , for any given @xmath42 , we can normalize the transmission @xmath47 ( eqs.@xmath30(7 ) and ( 8) ) by replacing @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "then the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath75 are rescaled with a factor of @xmath76 , and replaced with corresponding prime variables too . after the transformation , @xmath77 is independent of @xmath42 , so the charts of figs.@xmath302 ( b ) and ( c ) are sufficient to estimate the @xmath18 and @xmath19 at any really applied sweep speed @xmath42 . for example , if the sweep speed is @xmath78 , the measured peak / dip width should be rescaled with a factor of @xmath79 . using the rescaled widths to find out the apparent @xmath80 from the figs.@xmath30[fig : fig2](b ) and ( c ) , and rescale back the result @xmath80 with a factor of @xmath79 to get the real @xmath80 at current sweep speed .      for the other method ,",
    "a coupled microcavity and tapered fiber system can be calibrated and stabilized with fixed coupling and loss rates , and the frequency of the incident probe light is locked to the cavity resonance .",
    "the environment variation will change the dielectric properties of the cavity and cause a change of @xmath17 , then the detuning @xmath81 between probe light and cavity mode @xmath82 occurs , resulting in the change of transmittance .",
    "it has been proved in fabry - perot cavity that the linear increase of @xmath17 is equivalent to the decrease of @xmath83 with similar scanning speed @xcite .",
    "therefore , a persistent changing of @xmath17 at relatively high speed can generate a transient ringing transmission line too .",
    "( a ) the transmission response based on linear variation of resonance frequency beginning with critical coupling . the peak width ( b ) and height ( c ) varied with resonance sweeping speed and elapse time.,width=196 ]    taking a linear change of @xmath17 @xcite and initial critical coupling as an example",
    ", we investigate the feature of the transient transmission . for a general consideration",
    ", we study the spectrum for various cavity frequency change frequency and dynamic range , thus solve the temporal transmission numerically .",
    "a typical transmission curve is shown in fig.@xmath30[fig3](a ) . in this example , the change of @xmath17 begin at time @xmath84 .",
    "the transmittance is zero when @xmath85 because the system state is kept in critical coupling and the probe light is absorbed by the cavity completely .",
    "when @xmath17 start to change due to environment perturbation , the balance between the input laser and cavity leakage is broken suddenly , then a ringing line shape is formed .",
    "this scenario is similar as the case studied in previous subsection , where the laser frequency is sweeping while the cavity frequency is fixed .",
    "but , when the sweep speeds are the same the peak height is higher now than that in the sweep laser case .    in practice , @xmath17 may drifts in a period of time @xmath86 at sweep speed @xmath42 , then reaches the equilibrium position with the final detuning @xmath87 .",
    "then , the ringing tail will end to the steady state transmission level @xmath88 , which may less than unit evidently .",
    "correspondingly the definitions of peak height and peak width of @xmath47 are modified according to the horizon line of @xmath89 , as compare to fig.@xmath30[fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "peak width and peak height vary with @xmath86 and @xmath42 ( figs.@xmath30[fig3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) . in those figures of double logarithmic coordinates , @xmath81 on each of lines paralleling the diagonal dash line ,",
    "on which @xmath81 equals two times of line - width , are constant . in the lower",
    "left of the figures , shaded triangle infers there is no peak higher than @xmath90 .",
    "however , in this regime , the total frequency change is still within the cavity resonance and the change of cavity resonance is slow , the environment change can be estimated through quasi - static cavity response . at the right vertex of the triangle , though the sweep speed is as fast as critical speed , the short elapse time @xmath91 makes a narrow detuning @xmath92 .",
    "it means the @xmath93 , and in the time of sweeps , transmission is kept at the relative flat bottom of lorentz line - shape .",
    "the relative gentle variation of the transmission restrains the ringing phenomena .",
    "when the @xmath81 gets larger , first a broaden low peak arises , then it becomes sharper and higher .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath81 is larger than two times of line - width ( right upper region of the figures ) , the peaks are no longer varied with @xmath42 , especially in high speed side .",
    "this saturation about speed can be understood as the response time of the microcavity is limited to life time @xmath94 .",
    "though the @xmath17 drifts beyond the resonant frequency in a short time far less that @xmath94 at high sweep speed , the energy in the microcavity leaks out the cavity with its own pace .",
    "in addition , comparing the saturated peak height on the most right vertical line with the color bar , we can find peak height is proportional to @xmath95 .      for the two different approaches , we can find there are many differences . in the sweeping laser case , the frequency range of the sweeping is usually in the order of @xmath96 ghz , which provide a wide dynamic range of the sensor .",
    "however , for a fixed sweeping speed @xmath42 , the larger dynamic range also means longer repetition time @xmath44 for the laser sweeping through the wide frequency range .",
    "for example , the frequency of wgm in the silica microcavity may change by @xmath97 ghz when the environment temperature changes by @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "if the sweeping speed @xmath99 and frequency range is @xmath100 ghz , the dynamic range of the temperature sensor is @xmath101 k while @xmath102 . if the frequency range reduced by @xmath103 times , the dynamic range will only be @xmath104 k while @xmath105",
    "therefore , there is a trade - off between the temporal resolution and dynamic range .",
    "note that the sweeping laser transient sensor pre - assumed that the environment induced change speed of frequency or decay rate is much slower than @xmath42 . for a given @xmath42 ,",
    "higher q gives higher sensitivity .",
    "in contrast , the fixed frequency case show a much smaller dynamic range , which can only sense the event with frequency shift smaller than the linewidth , and is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than that in the sweeping laser case .",
    "the benefit is that this type of transient sensors can response to the external perturbation quickly within the time - window of @xmath106 , which is @xmath107 orders smaller than @xmath102 in the sweeping laser case .",
    "for example , a nanoparticle pass through the cavity may induce a small frequency change within @xmath108 .",
    "this event may be missed for the sweeping laser case , but can be monitored by the fixed laser case .",
    "there is a trade - off between the dynamic range ( linewidth of resonance ) and response time ( lifetime of resonance ) , and the sensitivity is also related to the linewidth",
    ".    therefore , the two different transient sensors are appropriate for different applications .",
    "when the perturbation induced frequency shift is very large but relatively slow , we can use the sweeping laser .",
    "when the perturbation is small but very fast , we can use the fixed laser .",
    "in both cases , an external reference cavity is required , which is used as frequency reference in the laser sweeping case or to lock the laser frequency for the fixed laser frequency case .",
    "it s also worth to note that the sensitivity of the transient sensor can also be improved comparing with that in the slowly sweeping case . in the transient response",
    ", the ringing transmission curve is sharper due to increased slope of @xmath109 ( the time is usually converted to frequency by @xmath42 in experiment ) .",
    "for example , the maximum slope ( the first ring up ) for @xmath110 is about 4 times larger than the maximum slope for @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , the refresh rate is also increased by increasing @xmath42 .",
    "one may argue that the shot noise of the laser also increase for faster sweeping laser , since the duration of time to sweep through the cavity resonance is proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "this can be improved by increasing the laser power for sweeping , the only limitation is that the power absorbed by the cavity should be smaller to avoid thermal or kerr effect .",
    "similarly , the slope will be larger for faster perturbation in the fixed laser frequency case , where the sensitivity depends on sensing event but not the equipments in experiments .",
    "in this section , we will analyze the practical application of the microcavity sensor for transient nanoparticle motion .",
    "the nanoparticle sensor can be used for study the kinetic properties of the nanosized particles , with micrometer - scale spatial resolution , and microsecond - scale temporal resolution . use the setup demonstrated recently @xcite , we can explore the mechanics , fluid dynamics and stochastic brownian motion with unprecedented precision .",
    "when a nanoparticle approaches the microcavity , it shifts the resonance ( @xmath17 ) , and also increases the loss of the microcavity by scattering .",
    "but in high @xmath28 microcavity , the internal lifetime @xmath113 mainly depends on the absorption loss of the cavity material .",
    "scattering loss like binding a nanoparticle or carving a small notch does not affect the lifetime much @xcite .",
    "so we can safely ignore the change of the @xmath113 , and fix the system in critical coupling region .",
    "in the following , we study the transient sensor initialized in critical coupling region , when the particles are far away .          as illustrated in fig.@xmath30[fig4:binding](a ) , a nanoparticle approaches the microcavity along a trace perpendicular to the outer rim , then is bound @xcite on the surface .",
    "the nanoparticle shifts the frequency of a mode by moving into the evanescent field of the mode .",
    "the degree of the shift is proportional to local field intensity @xcite .",
    "besides , the evanescent field of a mode decays ( decay factor @xmath114 ) exponentially along with the distance @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , a nanoparticle approaching the microcavity with constant velocity @xmath116 will induce a mode frequency shift which is exponentially increase with time ( figs.@xmath30[fig4:binding](b ) and ( c ) the first half of dotted green line ) @xmath117 here for the convenience of symbol system , the variation of @xmath17 has been equivalently transferred to @xmath12 . at time @xmath118 , the nanoparticle is in distant @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , and @xmath121 .",
    "when the nanoparticle touches the microcavity and be adhered to it , the @xmath122 for @xmath123 is a constant ( the last half of dotted green line in figs.@xmath30[fig4:binding](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "the @xmath124 , depending on inherent electromagnetic attributes of the particle , represents the degree of frequency shifting when the particle is bound on the surface .",
    "replace the @xmath12 of eq.@xmath30([eq : solution ] ) with the eq.@xmath30([eq : exp ] ) , we can get the transmission @xmath47 numerically .",
    "set @xmath125 , which means the maximum shift @xmath126 is @xmath127 times of linewidth .",
    "other parameters are the same with that in section iii .",
    "firstly , the transmission and its features varying with speed of the particles are investigated .",
    "the transmissions @xmath47 of various speeds are shown in fig.@xmath30[fig4:binding](b ) .",
    "similar to the previous analysis , the transient frequency shift induces ringing phenomena , the peak value increases with the increasing of speeds .",
    "in addition , the transmission for different particle sizes / volumes are studied , as shown in fig.@xmath30[fig4:binding](c ) . since the total resonant frequency shift @xmath124 is proportional to size / volume of the particle , the effective frequency shifting speed increases with the size . according to equations ( 6 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , the oscillation period of ringtail is inversely correlated to @xmath124 and thus decreases with increasing of size .",
    "the basic features , including oscillation period , peak width and peak height , varying with the particle size and speed are plotted in figs .",
    "4(d)-(f ) . using the features measured in experiments",
    ", we can identify the particle size and speed , since they correlate with these parameters in quite different ways .",
    "for example , from the curves extracted from the 2d maps , when size=40 , the oscillation period is almost constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig4:binding](d ) up panel ) , while peak width ( fig .",
    "[ fig4:binding](e ) up panel ) and height ( fig .",
    "[ fig4:binding](f ) up panel ) vary ; when speed is fixed by 20 m / s , the period almost inversely proportional to size ( fig .",
    "[ fig4:binding](d ) right panel ) , while the other two features remains the same ( figs .",
    "[ fig4:binding](e ) and ( f ) right panels ) .",
    "although the regime for small @xmath116 does not show ringing phenomena , but it s quasi - static process , we can determine the size and velocity from the slowly varing transmission line .",
    "for the down - right coner in figs .",
    "4(e ) and ( f ) , there is also no ringing because the transient sensor is ultimately limited by the cavity lifetime .",
    "in another practical sensor scenario , nanoparticle passes by the microcavity in a tangential way ( fig.@xmath30[fig5:gauss](a ) ) .",
    "set @xmath128 axis along the path .",
    "its positive direction is the direction of velocity of the nanoparticle .",
    "original point @xmath129 is the point which is nearest to the microcavity on the path .",
    "then , the frequency shift reads @xmath130 the @xmath131 is the initial position of nanoparticle when @xmath118 .",
    "the nanoparticle stays in the effective couple range in a short time inversely proportional to speed ( fig .",
    "[ fig5:gauss](b ) ) . in the @xmath47 curve ,",
    "we define bump width with full - width at @xmath132 to character it ( fig .",
    "[ fig5:gauss](b ) button panel ) .",
    "the characters of the @xmath47 concerning different particle speeds and sizes are performed ( figs.@xmath30[fig5:gauss](c)-(f ) ) . like the binding case , the period is only related to the size .",
    "the peak height , peak width and the bump width mainly vary with the speed .    at first glance , the contours of features of @xmath47 in the case of passing by are like that in the case of binding , except for a new feature bump width .",
    "but in detail investigation , the variations of features depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5:gauss ] are complicated than their counterpart in fig . [ fig4:binding ] . because in content of frequency shift , eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) is more complicated than the simple exponential relationship depicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) . the eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) is a exponential function , when @xmath133 ( i.e. , particle is far away from the microcavity ) . while it is simplified to a gaussian function , when @xmath134 .",
    "then the actual frequency shift is between the two extreme situations .",
    "based on the figs .",
    "[ fig4:binding ] and [ fig5:gauss ] , we find that the oscillation period is suitable to characterize the particle size in experiment .",
    "the peak width has the best sensitivity to detect particle speed when particle size is not less than 5 .",
    "in summary , based on the transient transmittance of high - q microcavities , the environment variation can be sensed with both high sensitivity and high temporal resolution .",
    "in addition to the enhanced frequency shift sensing , we can also sense the intrinsic and external cavity loss . especially , we studied the motive nanoparticle sensing and demonstrated that the speed and size of a nanoparticle can be determined by the experiment - measurable transmission .",
