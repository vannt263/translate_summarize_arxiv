    "uncertainty quantification of complex systems , whether natural or engineered , is a crucial ingredient in numerous fields of engineering , science , and medicine .",
    "the remarkable growth of computing power , complemented by matching gains in algorithmic speed and accuracy , has led to near - ubiquity of computational methods for estimating the statistical moments , probability laws , and other relevant properties of such systems . however , most existing methods @xcite , while successful in tackling small to moderate numbers of random variables , begin to break down for truly high - dimensional problems .",
    "the root deterrence to practical computability is often related to high dimension of the multivariate integration or interpolation problem , known as the curse of dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the dimensional decomposition of a multivariate function @xcite addresses the curse of dimensionality to some extent by developing an input - output behavior of complex systems with low effective dimensions @xcite , wherein the degrees of interactions between input variables attenuate rapidly or vanish altogether .",
    "a well - known prototype of dimensional decomposition is the analysis - of - variance or anova dimensional decomposition ( add ) , first presented by hoeffding in the 1940s in relation to his seminal work on @xmath0-statistics @xcite .",
    "since then , add has been studied by numerous researchers in disparate fields of mathematics @xcite , statistics @xcite , finance @xcite , and basic and applied sciences @xcite , including engineering disciplines , where its polynomial versions have been successfully applied for uncertainty quantification of high - dimensional complex systems @xcite .",

    "the author rules out the rosenblatt transformation @xcite or others commonly used for mapping dependent to independent variables , as they may induce overly large nonlinearity to a stochastic response , potentially degrading the convergence properties of probabilistic solutions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the classical add must be generalized for an arbitrary , non - product - type probability measure .",
    "doing so will require modifying the original annihilating conditions that will endow desirable orthogonal properties , insofar as is possible , to the generalization .",
    "indeed , inspired by stone @xcite and employing a set of weakened annihilating conditions , hooker @xcite provided an existential proof of a unique anova decomposition for dependent variables , referred to as the generalized add in this paper , subject to a mild restriction on the probability measure .",
    "furthermore , he introduced a computational method for determining the component functions of the generalized add by minimizing a mean - squared error with weakened annihilating conditions as constraints .",

    "two propositions and a theorem , proven herein , reveal two special properties of the generalized add , leading to a coupled system of equations satisfied by the component functions .",
    "these theoretical results , which subsume the classical add as a special case , are shown to reproduce the component functions for independent probability measures .",
    "secondly , section 5 introduces general multivariate orthogonal polynomials that are consistent with the probability measures of dependent input variables . a theorem and its proof presented in this section describe a new constructive method for finding the component functions of",
    "the generalized add in terms of measure - consistent , multivariate orthogonal polynomials .",
    "thirdly , the second - moment analysis of the generalized add is described in section 6 .",
    "it entails global sensitivity analysis , including triplets of sensitivity indices , for dependent probability distributions . using insights from the generalized add , extended definitions of two effective dimensions are proposed .",
    "numerical results , including approximate solutions of a random eigenvalue problem , are reported in section 7 to affirm the theoretical findings .",
