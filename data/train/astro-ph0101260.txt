    "classical be  stars are observed to be rotating close to their break up speeds ( slettebak @xcite ) with a modal value of @xmath4 ( porter @xcite ) , where @xmath5 is the stars critical break - up velocities .",

    "( @xcite ) , hummel & vrancken ( @xcite ) are most easily explained if it is assumed that there are keplerian motions within a disc .",
    "observations of be  star discs have shown that some can vanish and re - appear in a apparently random fashion with time - scales of 100s of days ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , ) .",
    "the major problem in be  star research is to identify the physical processes which produce and disperse the discs .",
    "theoretical models which have been presented include wind bi - stability ( ) , wind compressed discs ( bjorkman & cassinelli @xcite ) , and viscous outflowing discs ( lee et al .",
    "@xcite , also see porter ) .",
    "each of these models has problems : the wind models ( bi - stability and wind compression ) can not reproduce the keplerian rotation in the disc as the wind conserves angular momentum leading to a rotation law similar to @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "viscous outflowing discs successfully reproduce most of the attributes of the observed be  star discs ( _ e.g. _ continuum excess porter , @xmath7 variations in the emission lines ) , although the major problem is that the required source of angular momentum to sustain the disc remains obscure ( a tentative suggestion has been made that the angular momentum source relates to non - radial pulsations , @xcite ) .",
    "consequently our understanding of be  stars is still incomplete .",
    "theoretical models can only be constrained , or indeed ruled out , if their predictions can be confronted with observations of well understood be  star samples .",
    "hitherto , a homogeneous data set involving extensive wavelength coverage across all be  spectral types has been lacking .    in a series of papers",

    "it was selected in an attempt to contain several objects that were typical of each spectral and luminosity class in the above range ; it therefore does _ not _ reflect the spectral and luminosity class space distribution of be  stars , but only the average properties of each subclass in temperature and luminosity .",

    "it appears not to be possible to separate the interstellar and circumstellar components using infrared photometry alone .",

    "we calculate a systematic error of @xmath73 in @xmath74 and @xmath75 in @xmath76 .    in order to test our de - reddening procedure , we compare the measured interstellar reddening to an independent measure of the same quantity . for this",

    "it appears that both the traditional optical and our new infrared method are more reliable than the sodium equivalent width for determining the interstellar reddening to be stars . in the sections that follow we prefer to use our new method , as it is based on data taken closer in time ( within a few years ) to the spectroscopic data than the optical data ( over 30 years in many cases )",

    "it is worthy of note that van kerkwijk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) present similar results to ours regarding the relationship between line equivalent width and continuum excess , although they present h@xmath2 versus j - l excess emission . in that study , as with our results there is a strong ( apparently linear ) correlation between the lines and continuum excess .",
    "this correlation is not surprising , as the hydrogen lines and the near - ir excess continuum are typically formed in the same regions of the disc .",
    "van kerkwijk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) also show the line - excess continuum correlations for two popular models of the disc ",
    "waters disc model ( @xcite ) , and the poeckert & marlborough model ( pm ) ( @xcite )  and find that neither can replicate the results particularly well .",
    "the pm model produces too little line emission for a given continuum excess , and the disc model produces too much line emission , unless a large density gradient is used ( a radial density power law with an index larger than 3.5 seems to be necessary which appears to be inconsistent with the results obtained from iras data ) . whilst there is a large scatter in the data , we present the linear best - fit relationship from our results which any new model of be star discs should attempt to reproduce .",

    "figure  [ fig : he ] has @xmath101 and is therefore correlated at @xmath102 confidence level , although no linear correlation seems to exist .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the hei 2.058@xmath99 m line is extremely sensitive to changes in the uv continuum and optical depth ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows a plot of circumstellar excess against spectral type , we note that there appears to be no linear correlation and that @xmath103 which gives a confidence level of @xmath104 .",
    "however , the overall shape of the distribution is similar to that seen in  @xcite and  @xcite for the strength of the balmer series lines , with a broader range of excess around b1b2 .",
    "we note also that there is no correlation between luminosity class and circumstellar excess .",
    "stellar rotation has been fundamentally linked with the generation of the be  phenomenon ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) . if rotation is the sole cause of the phenomenon then we would expect to see a strong correlation between rotational velocity and circumstellar excess .",
