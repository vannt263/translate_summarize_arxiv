    "hawking radiation is one of the most important quantum effect when we are studying the quantum gravity in a black hole background spacetime .",
    "classically a black hole does not radiate , but when we consider quantum effects around a generic black hole geometry we have radiation . hawking s original work @xcite have shown that the calculation of the bogoliubov coefficients gives a planck distribution of radiation as one of thermodynamical properties .",
    "there are other derivation of hawking radiation taking account of the quantum effect in the black hole background as a tunneling process based on particles in a dynamical geometry @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is found that hawking radiation is determined by the horizon properties .",
    "another approach to understand hawking radiation is the calculation of the energy - momentum tensor in black hole backgrounds .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor should be conserved in a curved background in classical field theory with general covariance .",
    "however , quantum mechanically there is breaking of symmetry which gives rise to the anomaly term .    recently , robinson and wilczek @xcite and also iso , umetsu and wilczek @xcite proposed another derivation of the energy - momentum tensor which describes the hawking radiation as the compensation of the anomaly to break the classical symmetry .",
    "there are two types of anomalous currents , i.e. the consistent and the covariant .",
    "the anomaly equations with the consistent currents satisfy the wess zumino consistency condition but do not transform covariantly under a gauge transformation . on the other hand , banerjee and kulkarni @xcite@xcite made use of another method involving covariant current which transforms under gauge transformation , but which does not satisfy the wess zumino consistency condition .",
    "this method was extended to the case charged black holes , rotating black holes and other types of black holes @xcite@xcite@xmath3@xcite .    in this paper , we calculate the energy - momentum flux of the warped @xmath2 black hole in three dimensional topologically massive gravity with negative cosmological constant . in three dimensions",
    "ordinary einstein gravity is trivial , but with the gravitational chern - simons term there is a propagating massive graviton mode @xcite . in light of this , recently there has been some development to understand topologically massive gravity with negative cosmological constant @xmath4 @xcite@xmath3@xcite .",
    "we also consider another type of black hole in three dimensions , that of the charged rotating black hole .    in three dimensional topological massive gravity",
    ", there is an @xmath2 vacuum solution for any coefficient @xmath5 of the chern - simons action term .",
    "recently , it was shown that these solutions are unstable except at the chiral point @xmath6@xcite .",
    "more recently , for @xmath7 two other types of black hole solutions which have @xmath8-invariant warped @xmath2 geometries were with timelike or spacelike @xmath9 isometry , and at @xmath10 there are also a pair of solutions with a null @xmath9 isometry @xcite .    it is known that for @xmath11 warped black hole solutions are asymptotic to warped @xmath2 .",
    "it is also shown that these black hole solutions can be regarded as discrete quotients of warped @xmath2 just like btz black holes are discrete quotients of @xmath2 .",
    "guica et al.@xcite have argued that in the very near horizon region of an extreme kerr black hole , this geometry becomes warped @xmath2 with an @xmath12 isometries @xcite and the geometry of a three dimensional slice of fixed polar angle @xmath13 gives a quotient of warped @xmath2 with the identification of azimuthal angle @xmath14 @xcite@xcite .",
    "such quotients are warped @xmath15 black holes . with consistent boundary conditions",
    "the asymptotic symmetry generators give one copy of virasoro algebra with a chiral half of central charge .",
    "so they have conjectured that extreme kerr black holes are dual to a chiral conformal field theory . at @xmath10",
    "null warped @xmath2 is given as a solution and it can be related to the dual theory between gravity and conformal quantum mechanical theory @xcite .    here , we will concentrate on a type of spacelike stretched warped black hole solution @xcite .",
    "when we want to apply robinson and wilczek s method to the warped stretched @xmath2 black hole which has the different metric form for ` @xmath0 ' component and the inverse of ` @xmath1 ' component .",
    "there is another type of three dimensional black hole , which is charge rotating black hole @xcite .",
    "in fact , gangopadhyay and kulkarni @xcite have calculated the energy - momentum flux for a black hole with @xmath16 in a different context .",
    "their method can be applied to these black holes .",
    "in this section we will review how the hawking radiation can be obtained from the covariant anomaly .",
    "consider the reissner - nordstrm black hole metric of the following form : @xmath17 robinson and wilczek @xcite have considered that the energy flux of the hawking radiation can be given by the effective two dimensional theory having gravitational anomalies at the black hole horizon .",
    "this was further generalized for the case of charged black holes where gauge anomaly was also considered for the flux of charge @xcite .",
    "we can also consider anomaly analysis of hawking radiation for more general cases @xcite of the following type : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an angle @xmath20 $ ] and the horizon is located at @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    to consider hawking radiation via anomaly ,",
    "let us first consider the scalar field on this metric background .",
    "the action of this scalar field is @xmath24 & = & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\int d^3x \\sqrt{-g }               g^{\\mu\\nu } \\partial_{\\mu } \\psi \\partial_{\\nu } \\psi \\\\           & = & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\int dt dr",

    "if we go near the horizon , @xmath26 , the above action near the horizon can be effectively described with the following form @xmath27 = -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_m \\int dt dr ~ \\varphi_m^ *         \\left [            \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{f h } } ( \\partial_t - i m n^{\\phi})^2            - \\partial_r \\sqrt{f h}r \\partial_r         \\right ] \\varphi_m \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this action , @xmath28 as a two dimensional complex scalar field in the background @xmath9 static gauge field @xmath29 with charge @xmath30 . when we consider the charged rotating black hole in three dimensions , this two dimensional effective theory has two types of @xmath9 charges .",
    "one is from gauge field and the other from rotation @xcite@xcite .",
    "these two types of currents are identical in nature , so we consider one type of current and then we can use the same result .",
    "the idea of robinson and wilczek is to divide the region outside the horizon of black hole into two .",
    "first is the near horizon and the other sufficiently far away . near horizon region ( h )",
    "is described by two dimensional effective field theory .",
    "the radial direction @xmath31 and the time @xmath32 are the two dimensional coordinates .",
    "we can put the outgoing modes near the horizon as right moving modes and ingoing modes as left moving modes .",
    "the horizon being a null hypersurface , the ingoing modes at the horizon does not affect physics outside the horizon .",
    "it is a chiral theory and therefore there is chiral anomaly .",
    "the region away from the horizon ( o ) is four dimensional and is free of anomaly .",
    "the covariant gauge current is anomalous because modes interior to the horizon can not affect physics outside the horizon .",
    "the covariant gauge current conservation is given by @xmath33 where we take @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the current outside the horizon ( @xmath36 $ ] ) is anomaly free and satisfies the conservation law @xmath37 near the horizon ( @xmath38 $ ] ) , there are only outgoing fields and the current satisfies the anomalous equation @xmath39 it appears that we have introduced a very sharp boundary between two regions ( h ) and ( o ) .",
    "such a sharp boundary brings in delta functions in the analysis .",
    "there has been some works @xcite which did away with such delta functions , but in this paper we follow the original approach .",
    "solving above two equations , we get @xmath40 , \\label{coeffh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are integration constants . writing the current @xmath43 as a sum of two regions @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are step functions that are equal to 1 in region ( o ) and ( h ) respectively and vanish elsewhere .    then by using the conservation equations , the ward identity becomes @xmath47 the last term in the total derivative must be canceled by quantum effects of the classically irrelevant ingoing modes .",
    "this quantum effect induces the wess - zumino term by the ingoing modes near the horizon . under gauge transformation",
    ", the vanishing of the ward identity requires that the coefficient of the delta function is zero .",
    "this gives the following condition : @xmath48 the covariant current @xmath49 vanishes at the horizon .",
    "so the coefficient @xmath42 from ( [ coeffh ] ) is zero .",
    "therefore the value of the charge flux is given by @xmath50 if we consider another @xmath9 charge @xmath30 , then we have two @xmath9 gauge symmetries and currents .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath51 should be a sum of two gauge fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 with these @xmath9 gauge currents , the anomalous equation can be described by the following form @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the sum of @xmath9 currents @xmath57 associated with the @xmath9 charges @xmath58 respectively . in the presence of gauge fields , the energy - momentum tensor does not preserve the current conservation law but appears the lorentz force law .",
    "so the corresponding anomalous ward identity is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the covariant gravitational anomaly .",
    "for the metric ( [ metric1 ] ) , the covariant anomaly is purely time - like @xmath61 where @xmath62 outside region of the horizon , the energy - momentum tensor satisfies the conservation law @xmath63 considering the ward identity for the component @xmath64 , the conservation equation gives @xmath65 using ( [ coeffo ] ) with the change from @xmath66 to @xmath56 , we get @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an integration constant . near the horizon , the covariant energy - momentum tensor has the gravitational anomaly @xcite and this anomaly equation reads from equation ( [ gravi - anom ] ) @xmath69 using @xmath70 from equation ( [ coeffh ] ) changed from @xmath49 to @xmath70 and from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , the above equation solves @xmath73 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is an integration constant .",
    "writing the energy - momentum tensor as a sum of two contributions @xmath75 we find the following form for the covariant derivative of the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath76 the first term is a classical effect of the lorentz force .",
    "the second term should be canceled by the quantum effect of the irrelevant ingoing modes . the quantum effect to cancel this term is the wess - zumino term induced by the ingoing modes near the horizon . under the diffeomorphism invariance at the horizon , the last term should vanish @xmath77 substituting equations ( [ em - out ] ) and ( [ em - horizon ] ) into above equation , we obtain @xmath78 the integration constant @xmath74 can be fixed by requiring the covariant energy - momentum tensor to vanish at the horizon and this gives @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the final result is given by @xmath80 where we have used equation ( [ anomaly ] ) .",
    "this value can be interpreted as the energy - momentum flux which coincides with the flux from black body radiation with a chemical potential at temperature @xmath81 @xcite@xcite .",
    "this form of energy - momentum flux have already been mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the second term of ( [ energy - mom ] ) can be represented by the hawking temperature @xmath82 which is related to the surface gravity .",
    "surface gravity can be calculated as follows : @xmath83 the relationship between hawking temperature and surface gravity is given by @xmath84 . coming back to equation ( [ energy - mom ] ) ,",
    "we focus on the second term . for simplicity sake we will consider the case when @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in this case",
    "the flux becomes @xmath87 this form is the key formula in discussions of hawking radiation .",
    "the action of the three dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant @xmath88 and gravitational chern - simons term is @xcite @xmath89 the equations of motion are @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the cotten tensor defined by @xmath92 clearly all the vacuum solutions of einstein s equations automatically satisfy the equation of motion of topologically massive gravity . recently ,",
    "anninos et al .",
    "@xcite have found that there exist two other vacuum solutions which is given by @xmath93 - invariant warped @xmath2 geometries with a timelike or spacelike @xmath9 isometry for @xmath94 .",
    "the warping transition from a stretching solution to a squashing one occurs at critical point @xmath10 .",
    "two null warped @xmath2 solutions with a null @xmath9 isometry also exist .",
    "there are known warped black hole solutions which are asymptotic to @xmath2 for @xmath11 .",
    "we will only consider the solution for the asymptotically spacelike stretched case ( @xmath11 ) which are free of naked closed timelike curves @xcite .",
    "we can put the coefficient of the chern - simons action as @xmath95 in terms of the dimensionless coupling @xmath96 .",
    "then the metric describing the spacelike stretched black holes for @xmath97 is given in schwarzchild coordinates by @xmath98 where @xmath99 , t \\in [ -\\infty , \\infty]$ ] and @xmath100 . in the adm formalism , this metric can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 here @xmath103 and @xmath104 are locations of outer and inner horizons respectively . in order to obtain energy - momentum flux",
    ", we change the above metric to the form ( [ metric1 ] ) .",
    "if we put @xmath105 , then the metric ( [ adm ] ) becomes @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a function of @xmath108 which is described by a differentiation of @xmath109 with respect to @xmath31 . comparing this metric with @xmath110",
    "we can define @xmath111 with these functions , we can find the energy - momentum flux which is given by ( [ energy - mom ] ) .",
    "the anomaly term at the horizon @xmath112 gives @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are functions of @xmath108 which have differentiations with respect to @xmath108 but @xmath116 gives a derivative with respect to @xmath31 as a function of @xmath108 .",
    "we have @xmath117 using the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath118 . so the anomaly term becomes @xmath119 from ( [ surface - gv ] ) we can also find surface gravity @xmath120 using above two formulas ( [ anom - rho ] ) and ( [ s - gr - rho ] ) we have @xmath121 if we substitute @xmath122 into ( [ r - sq ] ) , then we can obtain @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively . in ref.@xcite it is noted that there exist physical black hole so long as @xmath125 and @xmath126 are non - negative in the parametric region given by @xmath127 . with this condition",
    "we have @xmath128 using this ( [ r - pm ] ) we can change the @xmath129 into the schwarzschild coordinates @xmath122 .",

    "as @xmath145 goes to 1 , the warped @xmath2 black hole does not go to btz black hole .",
    "in this section we will consider yet another 2 + 1 dimensional black hole .",
    "let us now consider the case of a charged rotating black hole in three dimensional space - times .",

    "the charged non - rotating black hole solution we start with is of the form @xmath150 where @xmath151 here @xmath152 and @xmath153 are adm mass and total charge of the black hole . after the rotation boost ,",
    "one obtains following forms for the functions in the metric : @xmath154 the electric potential @xmath155 transforms into a mixture of electric and magnetic potential , @xmath156 considering the metric ( [ metric - r - btz ] ) , we can replace the function @xmath157 and @xmath158 by @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively .",
    "then we can obtain @xmath161 and surface gravity is @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the inverse of the hawking temperature @xmath81 .",
    "the total flux of energy - momentum tensor is given by @xcite @xmath164 where @xmath165 .",
    "from the equations ( [ r - coordi ] ) and ( [ horizon ] ) , we can find the event horizon at @xmath166 where a subscript of function @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "there has been some work calculating hawking radiation of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional black holes @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "non - rotating but charged and rotating but chargeless black hole cases were considered separately . in this paper , since we considered a rotating and charged black hole , it can be regarded as a unified formulation .    in the above formula ,",
    "@xmath167 is the lambert function which is defined as the inverse of the function @xmath170 .",
    "so we have @xmath171 where the integer @xmath172 denotes the branch of @xmath173 when we consider the extension to complex plane @xmath174 . @xmath175 and @xmath176 are the only branches of lambert function @xmath177 which has real values .    from ( [ r - hor ] ) , we find that @xmath167 should have negative values .",

    "the lambert function occurs in the solution of time - delayed differential equation @xmath189 .",
    "this solution appears as a form @xmath190 . for more details",

    "when the electric charge turned on , this throat disconnects inner horizon @xmath199 from the black hole space .",
    "furthermore , a new inner horizon appears in the black hole space .",
    "this describes the perturbative instability of the inner horizon . in ( [ r - hor ] ) , outer and inner horizon are represented by @xmath200 and @xmath201 respectively . in order to have two horizons , the argument of the lambert function from ( [ r - hor ] )",

    "in particular , we have calculated the total flux of the energy - momentum tensor from warped spacelike stretched @xmath2 black hole in topologically massive gravity with negative cosmological constant , and also for the case of charged rotating black hole in three spacetime dimensions .",
    "the metric form of these two kinds of black holes does not have the same form that of the reisner - nordstrm black hole .",
