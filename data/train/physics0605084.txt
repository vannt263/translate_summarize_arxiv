    "one of the fundamental problems concerning the dynamics of particle beams in the storage rings of high energy accelerators is the determination of the beam s _ dynamical aperture _ ,",
    "i.e. the maximal domain containing the particles closest to their ideal circular path and for the longest possible time .",
    "for example , ",
    "flat \" hadron beams ( experiencing largely horizontal betatron oscillations ) can be described by 2dimensional ( 2d ) area  preserving maps , where the existence of invariant curves around the ideal stable path at the origin , guarantees the stability of the beam s dynamics for infinitely long times @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the chaotic motion between these invariant curves is always bounded and the particles never escape to infinity .",
    "other important phenomena that arise in this context is the presence of a major resonance in the form of a chain of islands through which the beam may be collected , or the existence of an outer invariant curve surrounding these islands , which serves as a boundary of the motion and thus allows an estimate of the beam s dynamical aperture .    on the other hand , hadron beams with a 2 - dimensional cross section require the use of @xmath0dimensional ( 4d ) symplectic mappings for the study of their dynamics @xcite .",
    "in fact , if longitudinal ( or synchrotron ) oscillations also need to be included the mappings become 6dimensional . in such cases ,",
    "the problems of particle loss are severe , as chaotic regions around different resonances are connected , providing a network of paths through which particles can move away from the origin , and eventually escape from the beam after sufficiently long times .    in this letter",
    ", we add to these issues the presence of space charges within a core radius @xmath1 , which is small compared to the beam s dynamical aperture . in other words , we will assume that our proton ( or antiproton ) beam is intense enough so that the effect of a charge distribution concentrated within this core radius can not be neglected .",
    "furthermore , we will consider this distribution as cylindrically symmetric and  frozen \" ( i.e. time independent , so that it may be self consistent with the linear lattice ) and study the dynamics of a hadron beam as it passes repeatedly through nonlinear magnetic focusing elements of the fodo cell type .",
    "this system has been studied extensively in the absence of space charge effects in @xcite and the question we raise now is whether its dynamics can be seriously affected if space charges are also taken into consideration .",
    "space charge presents a fundamental limitation to high intensity circular accelerators .",
    "its effects are especially important in the latest designs of high - intensity proton rings , which require beam losses much smaller than presently achieved in existing facilities .",
    "it is therefore necessary to estimate the major space charge effects which could lead to emittance growth and associated beam loss @xcite .",
    "the interplay between nonlinear effects , typical of single - particle dynamics , and space charge , typical of multi - particle dynamics induced by the coulomb interaction , represents a difficult challenge . to understand better these phenomena , an intense experimental campaign was launched at the cern proton synchrotron @xcite .",
    "it is very important , therefore , to develop analytical techniques which could be utilized in order to study and localize the associated web of resonances ( see e.g. @xcite ) to obtain an analytical estimation of the dynamic aperture , as suggested e.g. in @xcite .    in a recent paper , benedetti and turchetti @xcite used first order canonical perturbation theory to obtain analytical expressions for the jump in the position and momenta due to the multipolar kicks in such maps , showing that the space charges effectively modulate the tune at every passage of the particle through a nonlinear element of the lattice .",
    "in particular , they derived the new position and momentum coordinates after the @xmath2th passage through a fodo cell in the thin lens approximation , as the iterates of the 2d map @xmath3 where @xmath4 for @xmath5 , i.e. in the case of sextupole nonlinearities and @xmath6 the variables @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the parameters entering in the above expressions are related to the corresponding ones of the original hamiltonian @xmath9 by the formulas @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the depressed phase advance at the center of the charge distribution , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the coordinate along the ideal circular orbit , @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 @xmath16 satisfies @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 represents the radial charge density .",
    "note that if @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denote the mass , charge and velocity of our non - relativistic particles , the  perveance \" parameter @xmath23 determines the tune depression in ( [ eq : param ] ) , which must be small for the above analysis to be valid @xcite .",
    "the stage is now set for the investigation of space charge effects on the dynamics .",
    "however , the space advances @xmath24 needed in ( [ eq : map ] ) at every iteration depend on integrals of the distribution function @xmath25 that may not be available analytically . to overcome this difficulty , we choose in section ii a particular form of @xmath25 for which these integrals can be explicitly carried out not only for 2d maps of the  flat \" beam case , but also for 4d maps describing vertical as well as horizontal deflections of the beam s particles .",
    "thus , in section iii we perform numerical experiments to examine the influence of space charges on the dynamics and find indeed that even for small perveance values the long term stability of the beam is significantly affected . in particular , as @xmath26 grows ( or the tune depression @xmath27 decreases from 1 ) , perturbations of 2d as well as 4d maps show that the outer invariant  surfaces \" surrounding the ideal circular path at the origin disappear and the beam s dynamical aperture is seriously limited . only the major unperturbed stable resonances survive , with their  boundaries \" clearly diminished by the presence of new resonances due to space charge effects . in our 2d mapping model , a threshold value of @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 )",
    "was found , beyond which the beam is practically destroyed .",
    "the paper ends by describing our concluding remarks and work in progress in section iv .",
    "space charge effects on beam stability became a relevant topic during the years when construction of medium - low energy high currents accelerators , such as sns and the design of the fair rings at gsi were started @xcite ( see also many articles in the sns accelerator physics proceedings of the last few years ) .",
    "the role of collective effects and resonances has attracted considerable attention , since they can cause significant beam quality deterioration and losses @xcite .",
    "another relevant issue is the coupling with the longitudinal motion which modulates the transverse tune and induces losses by resonance crossing as shown by recent experiments @xcite .",
    "high intensity rings , where the bunches can circulate over one million turns , require a careful analysis of the long term stability of the beam .",
    "since the commonly used codes require large cpu times and exhibit an emittance growth due to numerical noise , they are not suited for long term dynamic aperture studies and the use of faster methods is necessary @xcite .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite allows us to introduce space charge effects in one single evaluation of the map , when a thin sextupole or octupole is present , just as one does in the absence of space charge , and is thus especially well suited for dynamical aperture calculations .",
    "let us choose for our space charge distribution function in the 1dimensional case the form @xmath28 the generalization to 2 dimensions is evident by replacing @xmath29 by @xmath30 in ( [ eq : distr1 ] ) .",
    "observe that this function satisfies the requirements that @xmath31 , @xmath32 as @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath33 , ( using ( [ eq : dens ] ) ) , as expected from the theory @xcite .",
    "evaluating now by elementary manipulations the integral in ( [ eq : omega ] ) , using ( [ eq : distr1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dens ] ) , we find that it is given by the closed form expression @xmath35 thus , the phase advance at every iteration becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 is given by ( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "note that , in the limit @xmath38 , eq .  ( [ eq : omega1 ] ) implies that @xmath39 as expected .",
    "in fact , expanding the square root in that limit we find @xmath40 from which we can estimate the deviation of @xmath41 from the depressed tune @xmath11 near the origin . in section iii below",
    "we pick an @xmath42 such that for @xmath43 we have a major resonance and a relatively large dynamical aperture in the @xmath44 plane , select @xmath1 small compared with this aperture and vary @xmath26 to study the space charge effect on the dynamics .",
    "let us now observe that in two space dimensions the original hamiltonian of the system , ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) , becomes @xmath45 where sextupole nonlinearities involve , of course , both @xmath46 and @xmath47 variables .",
    "since there are now two tune depressions @xmath48 after transforming to new variables @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 differentiating the hamiltonian with respect to @xmath54 and @xmath55 and integrating over @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we find the two tune depressions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with 1 replaced by 2 in ( [ eq : omega2 ] ) , while a is defined by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 .    observe that we have used for the @xmath63 function under the integral sign ( see ( [ eq : omega ] ) ) , the expression @xmath64 , derived from our simple choice of the distribution function ( [ eq : distr1 ] ) using ( [ eq : dens ] ) .",
    "the above @xmath65 and @xmath59 are to be used in the iterations of the 4d mapping : @xmath66 whose dynamics has already been studied extensively in @xcite in the absence of space charge effects , i.e for @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in these papers",
    ", it was observed that for the tune values @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , in @xmath71 a large dynamical aperture is achieved , with interesting chains of resonant  tori \" surrounding the origin . in section iii we will study what happens to these structures when @xmath72 ( i.e @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) and space charge effects are taken into account . before doing this",
    ", however , it is necessary to describe how the integrals in ( [ eq : omega2 ] ) are to be evaluated : let us first perform the integration over @xmath57 , writing @xmath75 where @xmath76 the integral ( [ eq : inti1 ] ) can be evaluated as before with elementary functions to yield @xmath77^{1/2 } } = 2\\pi\\left [ \\left(1+\\frac{2j_1\\cos^2\\theta_1}{r_1 ^ 2}\\right ) \\left(1+\\frac{2j_1\\cos^2\\theta_1}{r_1 ^",
    "2}+ \\frac{2j_2}{r_2 ^ 2}\\right)\\right]^{-1/2}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : inti2}\\ ] ] inserting now expression ( [ eq : inti2 ] ) into the integral ( [ eq : intk ] ) , changing integration variable to @xmath78 , we easily arrive , after some simple manipulations , to the expression @xmath79^{1/2}}\\,\\ , , \\label{eq : intk2}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 we finally make the substitution @xmath81 and rewrite the above integral in the form @xmath82 \\left[(d_1 - 1)u^2 + 1+d_1\\right ] \\right\\}^{1/2}}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : intk1}\\ ] ] this is clearly not an elementary integral .",
    "notice , however , that all terms in the denominator of ( [ eq : intk1 ] ) are positive and as @xmath83 the integrand vanishes as @xmath84 .",
    "it is , therefore , expected to converge very rapidly and may be computed , at every iteration of the map , using standard routines . for practical purposes , however , in section iii below",
    ", we prefer to compute instead its equivalent form ( [ eq : intk2 ] ) .",
    "of course , as explained above , a similar integral , @xmath85 , also needs to be computed ( with @xmath86 in ( [ eq : intk ] ) , ( [ eq : intk2 ] ) and ( [ eq : cd ] ) ) , whence @xmath65 and @xmath59 are found and the next iteration of the 4d map ( [ eq : map2 ] ) can be evaluated .",
    "let us now turn to some practical applications of the above theory to specific problems concerning the stability of hadron beams passing through fodo cell magnetic focusing elements and experiencing sextupole nonlinearities , as described in @xcite .",
    "first , we shall consider the flat beam case ( [ eq : map ] ) , for the specific tune value @xmath87 corresponding to frequency @xmath88 , exhibiting , in the absence of space charge perturbations , the phase space picture shown in figure [ graph_1](a ) below . as we see in this figure , the region of bounded particle motion extends to a radius of about 0.54 units from the origin .",
    "there are also 5 islands of a major resonance surrounded by invariant curves ( or 1d  tori \" ) , whose outermost boundary delimits the so - called dynamical aperture of the beam . outside that domain",
    "there are chains of smaller islands ( representing higher order resonances ) and chaotic regions through which particles eventually escape to infinity .",
    "this escape occurs , of course , at different speeds due to the well - known phenomenon of  stickiness \" , depending on how close the orbits are to the invariant curves surrounding the islands .",
    "let us now consider a space charge distribution of the form ( [ eq : distr1 ] ) with a  frozen core \" of radius @xmath89 , which is small compared with the radius of the beam s dynamical aperture .",
    "our purpose is to vary the value of the preveance @xmath90 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : ham1 ] ) , starting from @xmath43 , to estimate the effects of space charge on the dynamics .",
    "setting @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , for example , which is quite small compared with @xmath93 , we observe in figure [ graph_1](b ) that the picture has significantly changed .",
    "in particular , the 3-dimensional character of the dynamics ( due to the variation of the space advance @xmath24 ) has turned the invariant curves into  surfaces \" and has led to the dissolution of the outer ones surrounding the five major islands .",
    "furthermore , most of the chains of smaller islands of figure [ graph_1](a ) have disappeared due to the new resonances caused by the presence of space charges . to see how all this affects the dynamical aperture of the beam as a function of the tune depression @xmath27",
    "we now perform the following experiment :    forming a grid of initial conditions of step size @xmath94 within a square @xmath95\\times[-1,1]$ ] about the origin ( @xmath96 ) , we use ( [ eq : map ] ) to iterate for different @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 ) all points falling within circular rings of width @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 iterations and plot in figure [ graph_2 ] the last @xmath102 value , at which at least one orbit was found to escape from the next outer ring .",
    "the results demonstrate that already at @xmath91 ( @xmath103 ) our estimate of the dynamical aperture @xmath104 has fallen from @xmath105 to about @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , it remains close to that value ( rising somewhat to about @xmath107 ) until @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , where it experiences a sudden drop to @xmath110 , and the beam is effectively destroyed .",
    "of course , once one orbit escapes most of them quickly follow within the next one or two circular rings .",
    "note also that increasing the number of iterations from @xmath100 to @xmath101 does not appreciably change the results , until the sudden drop occurs .",
    "this dramatic change at @xmath109 is most probably due to the presence of a major new resonance caused by the space charge perturbation",
    ". it may be an important effect , however , since it occurs at a @xmath26 value which is still smaller than the @xmath93 radius of the charge core .",
    "of course , long before this happens , already at @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 ) , the effective aperture of the beam has been significantly reduced by about 20 percent from its value at @xmath43 .",
    "finally , let us turn to the case of the 4d map ( [ eq : map2 ] ) , describing the more realistic case of a beam whose particles experience horizontal as well as vertical displacements from the ideal path , see ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we choose the same parameter values as in our earlier papers @xcite , i.e horizontal and vertical tunes @xmath69 , @xmath70 respectively , yielding the unperturbed frequencies ( [ eq : tunes ] ) used in the mapping equations . in figure [ graph_3](a ) , we iterate many initial conditions @xmath113 around the origin and plot on a @xmath114 projection a picture of the dynamics , for @xmath115 , in the absence of space charges , i.e. with @xmath116 , @xmath117 .    note the region of invariant tori and a chain of 6  islands \" corresponding to a stable resonance .",
    "strictly speaking , the motion between these tori need not be bounded as 2d surfaces do not separate 4d space and arnold diffusion phenomena @xcite could in principle carry orbits far away from the origin .",
    "however , as has been explicitly shown for this model in @xcite , such phenomena are extremely slow and hence a domain with radius of the order of 0.5 can be effectively considered as the dynamical aperture of the beam . repeating this experiment in the presence of space charges , i.e. with @xmath118 ( or @xmath119 ) in ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) , we observe in figure [ graph_3](b ) that the outer invariant curves ( together with the islands ) have been destroyed and the dynamical aperture of the beam has been significantly reduced .    studying this reduction as a function of @xmath26",
    ", we proceed to choose initial conditions from a grid of step size 0.05 , extending from -0.65 to 0.65 in all 4 directions about the origin , represented by @xmath113 .",
    "iterating the resulting orbits from points within spherical shells of width @xmath120 , we plot in figure [ graph_4 ] , for each @xmath26 , the @xmath104 value of the inner radius of the shell from which at least one orbit escapes to infinity .",
    "our results demonstrate that the beam s dynamical aperture steadily decreases as @xmath26 grows . at @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) its radius",
    "has fallen by more than 50 percent from its original value , while at higher perveance values the approximation @xmath123 no longer applies .",
    "in fact , it is worth noting that the size of the dynamical aperture falls drastically even for small values of @xmath26 , as our calculations with @xmath100 iterations show .",
    "for example even at @xmath118 ( or @xmath124 ) our estimate of the dynamical aperture has dropped from 0.54 to 0.37 .",
    "high intensity effects have long been studied in connection with the so called beam - beam interaction and were a relevant topic in the design of many hadron colliders like isabelle and the ssc ( see articles in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the effects of high currents on the beam stability have become especially crucial only in recent times , when the design and construction of medium energy high current accelerators has started .",
    "we have reported in this letter our results on the possible importance of space charge effects to the global stability of intense hadron beams , experiencing the sextupole nonlinearities of an array magnetic focusing elements , through which the particles pass @xmath125 times in a typical  medium term \" experiment of intense beam dynamics .",
    "we have used a recently developed analytical approach @xcite to model the space charges by a ",
    "frozen core \" distribution , valid to first order in canonical perturbation theory . by proposing a simple example of such a distribution , which leads to explicit and convenient formulas , we have been able to carry out detailed numerical investigations on perturbations of 2d and 4d mapping models , describing the dynamics of flat ( horizontal ) and elliptic beams ( with horizontal and vertical displacements ) respectively .",
    "these charge distributions are in effect periodic modulations of the tunes ( and space advance frequencies ) of the motion and are therefore expected to introduce new resonances , raising the phase space dimensionality of the dynamics .",
    "thus , outer invariant tori of the unperturbed case start to disappear and  island \" chains of higher order resonances far from the origin eventually drift away , leading to a significant decrease of the region of bounded betatron oscillations of the particles about their ideal path ( i.e.  the beam s dynamical aperture , or luminosity ) .    in our experiments ,",
    "we have been able to measure this reduction of the beam s dynamical aperture , for several small values of the perveance parameter @xmath26 , representing the strength of the space charge distribution .",
    "we found that , within the range of validity of our approximations , the domain of bounded orbits decreases by a significant percentage and hence space charge effects should be taken into consideration as they can be important for the long term survival of the beam . in the flat beam case",
    ", we observed a near total loss of the beam at some @xmath26 value , which is most likely caused by the onset of a major new resonance introduced by the space charge modulations . on the other hand , in the more general case of a beam with 2- dimensional cross section modelled by a 4- dimensional map , we also discovered a sudden drop in the dynamical aperture , occurring already at very small tune depressions .",
    "we , therefore , believe that space charges are important enough to merit further investigation in mapping models of intense proton beams @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of new low order resonances poses , of course , a major threat to the dynamics , if the perveance parameter is big enough .",
    "however , even at small values of this parameter , weak ( arnold ) diffusion effects and the slow drift of high order resonances , may significantly alter the long term picture of the motion , after a sufficiently great number of iterations .",
    "it would also be useful to compare the one turn map with the full integration of the space charge effect over one beam revolution to appreciate the validity limits of our approximation .",
    "indeed , since the high computation efficiency of the one turn map is a key issue of this approach , an estimate of the errors in some reference cases would contribute additional useful information in realistic applications .",
