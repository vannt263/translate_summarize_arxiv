    "when a system is quenched from a homogeneous high - temperature disordered state into a low - temperature regime , well defined domains of equilibrium ordered phases form randomly and then grow with time ( `` coarsen '' ) in a self - similar way , until the domain size becomes comparable to the size of the system @xcite .",
    "a dynamic scaling hypothesis suggests that , at late times , the evolution of the system is characterized by a single length scale @xmath22 that represents a typical linear size of the domains .",
    "it is well established , at least for systems with a scalar order parameter , that @xmath23 with @xmath24 for _ non - conserved _ dynamics and @xmath25 for _ conserved _ dynamics @xcite .",

    "experimental realizations are known for @xmath26 i.e. the ising model and for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 case describes several cellular structures @xcite , e.g. polycrystals @xcite , soap froths @xcite , magnetic bubbles @xcite and foams @xcite .",
    "such coarsening systems are amongst those which have received considerable attention in recent years with regard to their _ persistence _ properties @xcite .",

    "experimental studies include the coarsening dynamics of breath figures @xcite , foams @xcite , soap froths @xcite , twisted nematic liquid crystals @xcite , and one - dimensional gas diffusion @xcite .",

    "the non - triviality of @xmath20 emerges as a consequence of the coupling of the field @xmath30 to its neighbors , since such coupling implies that the stochastic process at a fixed point in space and time is non - markovian . for the @xmath0-state potts model at @xmath34 ,",
    "the fraction of spins which have never flipped up to time @xmath3 ( i.e that fraction that have _ persisted _ in their original phase ) , has been observed @xcite to obey a power law decay @xmath35 , where @xmath6 has been obtained exactly , in one - dimension ( 1d ) , by derrida _",

    ", each spin @xmath39 has a probability @xmath40 of becoming equal to its right neighbor , @xmath40 of becoming equal to its left neighbor and a probability @xmath41 of retaining its own value .",
    "the domain walls therefore perform random walks . upon contact ,",
    "two domain walls react instantaneously , either _ annihilating _ @xmath42 with probability @xmath43 or _ coalescing _ @xmath2 with probability @xmath44 , these numbers being the probabilities that the states on the far sides of the walkers are the same ( annihilation ) or different ( coalescence ) .",
    "this reaction - diffusion model , together with the fact that in the initial condition each bond is occupied by a domain wall with probability @xmath45 , is completely equivalent to the spin problem .",
    "the fraction of spins which have never flipped up to time @xmath3 is then simply the fraction of sites which have never been visited by a random walker .",
    "the probabilistic algorithm for implementing the potts model through the annihilation or coalescence of random walkers allows @xmath0 to be a real number but is restricted to @xmath46 . however , an equivalent ising spin representation of the potts persistence problem @xcite permits a study @xcite of @xmath6 in the regime @xmath47 .    in the present work we study the fraction of random walkers which have never encountered another walker , using the reaction - diffusion representation of the 1d glauber - potts model at zero temperature . to facilitate our discussion ,",
    "we consider all the random walkers at time @xmath48 to be uninfected .",
    "all the walkers are , however , considered to be infectious , so that for @xmath49 any contact between walkers ( assuming they survive the encounter ) leads to mutual contamination .",
    "walkers that avoid all contact remain uninfected .",
    "our goal , therefore , is to address the fraction of uninfected walkers @xmath50 up to time @xmath3 .",
    "this problem has been addressed in some detail by a number of different authors @xcite , although under the guise of a different interpretation .",
    "the general approach used involves monitoring the motion of a tagged test particle , released in the system at time @xmath51 .",
    "if the tagged particle diffuses with diffusion constant @xmath52 and the other particles in the system diffuse with diffusion constant @xmath53 , the tagged particle is viewed as an external impurity diffusing through a homogeneous background .",
    "one is then interested in addressing the survival probability of the tagged particle i.e. , the probability is has not been absorbed by another particle in the system .",
    "of course in our terminology , this corresponds to the probability that the tagged particle remains uninfected .",
    "it is well established @xcite that @xmath50 decays according to a power law @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the ratio of the two diffusion constants in the problem .",
    "when @xmath56 , corresponding to a static impurity , the model clearly maps onto the problem of persistent spins and in this case , @xmath57 .",
    "the exponent @xmath58 is therefore considered a generalization of the standard persistence exponent @xmath6 , characterizing the survival probability of a mobile particle under the coarsening dynamics of the potts model .",
    "a recent study of the survival probability of a mobile particle , moving according to either deterministic or stochastic rules , in given in @xcite , where the external fluctuating field takes the form of either the solution to the diffusion equation , the coarsening dynamics of the @xmath0-state potts model or spatially uncorrelated brownian signals .    in the limit @xmath59",
    "the potts model is equivalent to the @xmath60 single species coalescence process .",
    "the dynamics of this system are particularly simple , since each particle sees only the `` cage '' formed by its two nearest neighbors .",
    "it is immaterial that these neighbors may coalesce with more distant particles .",
    "consequently , the kinetics of each particle involves only itself and its two nearest neighbors and one is therefore able to calculate @xmath61 exactly @xcite : @xmath62}\\ . \\label{inf}\\ ] ] ( note that for @xmath63 , this of course reduces to the static persistence exponent , @xmath64 . ) in the limit of the ising model ( @xmath65 ) , there is , however , no corresponding exact result for general @xmath66 .",

    "a mean - field smoluchowski @xcite approach predicts for @xmath65 and general @xmath66 that , @xmath68 , in good agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",

    "more recently , however , a perturbation theory developed by monthus @xcite has evaluated the exponent @xmath58 to first order in @xmath70 for arbitrary @xmath66 and at first order in @xmath66 for arbitrary @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we will not study the exponent @xmath58 in complete generality since we are primarily interested in the special case where all of the particles are equally mobile @xmath71 and henceforth we therefore write @xmath72 .    within the context of the current work , where we are interested in the case @xmath73 , the random walkers represent the motion of domain walls undergoing zero temperature coarsening .",
    "the fraction of uncollided domain walls ( i.e. , uninfected walkers ) has previously been interpreted as `` domain wall persistence '' or equally , the probability that two adjacent domains survive . under this interpretation ,",
