    "both granular superconductors and artificially prepared arrays of josephson junctions ( jjas ) proved useful in studying the numerous quantum ( charging ) effects in these interesting systems , including blockade of cooper pair tunneling  @xcite , bloch oscillations  @xcite , propagation of quantum ballistic vortices  @xcite , spin - tunneling related effects using specially designed @xmath1-type junctions  @xcite , novel coulomb effects in @xmath2-type nanoscale junctions  @xcite , and recently observed geometric quantization phenomena  @xcite ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the recent review on charge and spin effects in mesoscopic 2d josephson junctions ) .",
    "more recently , it was realized that jjas can be also used as quantum channels to transfer quantum information between distant sites  @xcite through the implementation of the so - called superconducting qubits which take advantage of both charge and phase degrees of freedom ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on quantum - state engineering with josephson - junction devices ) .    at the same time , imaging of the granular structure in underdoped @xmath3 crystals  @xcite , revealed an apparent charge segregation of its electronic structure into superconducting domains ( of the order of a few nanometers ) located in an electronically distinct background .",
    "in particular , it was found that at low levels of hole doping ( @xmath4 ) , the holes become concentrated at certain hole - rich domains .",
    "tunneling between such domains leads to intrinsic granular superconductivity ( gs ) in high-@xmath0 superconductors ( hts ) .",
    "as was shown earlier  @xcite , gs based phenomena can shed some light on the origin and evolution of the so - called paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) which manifests itself both in high-@xmath0 and conventional superconductors  @xcite .    in this paper , within a previously suggested  @xcite model of jjas created by a regular 2d network of twin - boundary ( tb ) dislocations with strain fields acting as an insulating barrier between hole - rich domains in underdoped crystals ,",
    "we address yet another class of interesting phenomena which are actually dual to the chemomagnetic effects described in ref .",
    "specifically , we discuss a possible existence of a non - zero electric polarization @xmath5 ( chemomagnetoelectic effect ) and the related change of the charge balance in intrinsically granular non - stoichiometric material under the influence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we predict an anomalous low - field magnetic behavior of the effective junction charge @xmath6 and concomitant magnetocapacitance @xmath7 in paramagnetic meissner phase and a charge analog of `` fishtail''-like anomaly at high magnetic fields .",
    "recall that the observed  @xcite in hts single crystals regular 2d dislocation networks of oxygen depleted regions with the size @xmath8 of a few burgers vectors can provide quite a realistic possibility for existence of 2d josephson network within @xmath9 plane  @xcite . in this regard , it is also important to mention the pioneer works by khaikin and khlyustikov  @xcite on twinning - induced superconductivity in dislocated crystals .    at the same time , in underdoped crystals there is a real possibility to facilitate oxygen transport via the so - called osmotic mechanism  @xcite which relates a local value of the chemical potential @xmath10 with a local concentration of point defects as follows @xmath11 , and allows us to explicitly incorporate the oxygen deficiency parameter @xmath12 into our model by relating it to the excess oxygen concentration of vacancies @xmath13 as follows @xmath14 .",
    "assuming the following connection between the variation of mechanical and chemical properties of planar defects , namely @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is screened strain field produced by tetragonal regions in @xmath17-wave orthorhombic @xmath18 crystal , @xmath19 is an effective atomic volume of the vacancy , and @xmath20 is the bulk elastic modulus ) , we can study the properties of tb induced jjs under intrinsic chemical pressure @xmath21 ( created by the variation of the oxygen doping parameter @xmath22 ) .",
    "more specifically , a single @xmath23 type junction ( comprising a josephson network ) is formed around tb due to a local depression of the superconducting order parameter @xmath24 over distance @xmath8 producing thus a weak link with josephson coupling @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( here @xmath27 with @xmath28 being a resistance of the junction ) .",
    "notice that , in accordance with the observations , for stoichiometric situation ( when @xmath29 ) , the josephson coupling @xmath30 and the system loses its explicitly granular signature .",
    "to describe the influence of chemomagnetic effects on charge balance of an intrinsically granular superconductor , we employ a model of 2d overdamped josephson junction array which is based on the well known hamiltonian @xmath31 and introduces a short - range ( nearest - neighbor ) interaction between @xmath32 junctions ( which are formed around oxygen - rich superconducting areas with phases @xmath33 ) , arranged in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice with coordinates @xmath34 .",
    "the areas are separated by oxygen - poor insulating boundaries ( created by tb strain fields @xmath35 ) producing a short - range josephson coupling @xmath36 .",
    "thus , typically for granular superconductors , the josephson energy of the array varies exponentially with the distance @xmath37 between neighboring junctions ( with @xmath17 being an average junction size ) . as usual",
    ", the second term in the rhs of eq.(1 ) accounts for coulomb effects where @xmath38 is the junction charge with @xmath39 being the pair number operator .",
    "naturally , the same strain fields @xmath35 will be responsible for dielectric properties of oxygen - depleted regions as well via the @xmath12-dependent capacitance tensor @xmath40 $ ] .    if , in addition to the chemical pressure @xmath41 , the network of superconducting grains is under the influence of an applied frustrating magnetic field @xmath42 , the total phase difference through the contact reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the initial phase difference ( see below ) , @xmath45 with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the london penetration depth of superconducting area and @xmath49 an insulator thickness ( which , within the discussed here scenario , is simply equal to the tb thickness  @xcite ) .    as usual , to safely neglect the influence of the self - field effects in a real material",
    ", the corresponding josephson penetration length @xmath50 must be larger than the junction size @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the critical current density of superconducting ( hole - rich ) area .",
    "as we shall see below , this condition is rather well satisfied for hts single crystals .",
    "in what follows , we shall be interested in the behavior of magnetic field induced electric polarization ( chemomagnetoelectricity ) in chemically induced gs described by a @xmath52 jja . recall that a conventional ( zero - field ) pair polarization operator within the model under discussion reads  @xcite @xmath53 in view of eqs.(1)-(3 ) , and taking into account a usual `` phase - number '' commutation relation , @xmath54=i\\delta _ { ij}$ ]",
    ", it can be shown that the evolution of the pair polarization operator is determined via the equation of motion @xmath55 = \\frac{2e}{\\hbar } \\sum_{ij}^nj_{ij}\\sin \\phi _ { ij}(t){\\bf x}_{ij}\\ ] ] resolving the above equation , we arrive at the following net value of the magnetic - field induced longitudinal ( along @xmath56-axis ) electric polarization @xmath57 and the corresponding effective junction charge @xmath58 where @xmath59 is properly defined normalization area , @xmath60 is a characteristic time ( see discussion ) , and we made a usual substitution @xmath61 valid in the long - wavelength approximation  @xcite .    to capture the very essence of the superconducting analog of the chemomagnetoelectric effect , in what follows we assume for simplicity that a _ stoichiometric sample _ ( with @xmath62 ) does not possess any spontaneous polarization at zero magnetic field , that is @xmath63 . according to eq.(5 ) , this condition implies @xmath64 for the initial phase difference with @xmath65 .    taking the applied magnetic field along the @xmath66-axis ( and normal to the @xmath9 plane ) , that is @xmath67",
    ", we obtain finally @xmath68 for the magnetic field behavior of the effective junction charge in chemically induced granular superconductors .",
    "here @xmath69 with @xmath70 defined earlier , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the chemically - induced contribution ( which disappears in optimally doped systems with @xmath29 ) , and @xmath75 is a characteristic josephson field .",
    "fig.1 shows changes of the initial ( stoichiometric ) effective junction charge @xmath76 ( solid line ) with oxygen deficiency @xmath77 .",
    "notice a sign change of @xmath76 ( dotted and dashed lines ) driven by non - zero values of @xmath77 at low magnetic fields ( a charge analog of chemically induced pme ) . according to eq.(6 ) ,",
    "the effective charge changes its sign as soon as the chemomagnetic contribution @xmath78 exceeds an applied magnetic field @xmath79 ( see discussion ) .    at the same time",
    ", fig.2 presents a true _ chemoelectric _ effect with concentration ( deficiency ) induced effective junction charge @xmath80 in zero magnetic field .",
    "notice that @xmath80 exhibits a maximum around @xmath81 ( in agreement with the classical percolative behavior observed in non - stoichiometric @xmath82 samples  @xcite ) .",
    "it is of interest also to consider the magnetic field behavior of the concomitant effective flux capacitance @xmath83 which in view of eq.(6 ) reads @xmath84 where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "fig.3 depicts the behavior of the effective flux capacitance @xmath87 in applied magnetic field for different values of oxygen deficiency parameter : @xmath29 ( solid line ) , @xmath88 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath89 ( dotted line ) .",
    "notice a decrease of magnetocapacitance amplitude and its peak shifting with increase of @xmath77 and sign change at low magnetic fields which is another manifestation of the charge analog of chemically induced pme ( cf .",
    "so far , we neglected a possible field dependence of the chemical potential @xmath90 of oxygen vacancies .",
    "recall , however , that in high enough applied magnetic fields @xmath79 , the field - induced change of the chemical potential @xmath91 becomes tangible and should be taken into account  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we end up with a superconducting analog of the so - called _ magnetoconcentration _ effect  @xcite with field induced creation of oxygen vacancies @xmath92 which in turn brings about a `` fishtail''-like behavior of the high - field chemomagnetization ( see ref .  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "fig.4 shows the field behavior of the effective junction charge in the presence of the above - mentioned magnetoconcentration effect .",
    "as it is clearly seen , @xmath93 exhibits a `` fishtail''-like anomaly typical for previously discussed  @xcite chemomagnetization in underdoped crystals with intragrain granularity ( for symmetry and better visual effect we also plotted @xmath94 in the same figure ) .",
    "this more complex structure of the effective charge appears when the applied magnetic field @xmath79 matches an intrinsic chemomagnetic field @xmath95 ( which now also depends on @xmath79 via the magnetoconcentration effect ) . notice that a `` fishtail '' structure of @xmath93 manifests itself even at zero values of field - free deficiency parameter @xmath96 ( solid line in fig.4 ) thus confirming a field - induced nature of intrinsic granularity  @xcite .",
    "likewise , fig.5 depicts the evolution of the effective flux capacitance @xmath97 in applied magnetic field @xmath98 in the presence of magnetoconcentration effect ( cf .",
    "thus , the present model predicts appearance of two interrelated phenomena ( dual to the previously discussed behavior of chemomagnetizm  @xcite ) , namely a charge analog of meissner paramagnetism at low fields and a charge analog of `` fishtail '' anomaly at high fields . to see whether these effects can be actually observed in a real material ,",
    "let us estimate an order of magnitude of the main model parameters .    using typical  @xcite for hts single crystals values of @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , we arrive at the following estimates of the characteristic @xmath102 and chemomagnetic @xmath103 fields , respectively .",
    "so , the predicted charge analog of pme should be observable for applied magnetic fields @xmath104 .",
    "notice that , for the above set of parameters , the josephson length is of the order of @xmath105 , which means that the assumed in this paper small - junction approximation is valid and the `` self - field '' effects can be safely neglected .    furthermore , the characteristic frequencies @xmath106 needed to probe the suggested here effects are related to the processes governed by tunneling relaxation times @xmath107 . since for oxygen deficiency parameter @xmath88",
    "the chemically - induced zero - temperature josephson energy in non - stoichiometric @xmath18 single crystals is of the order of @xmath108 , we arrive at the required frequencies of @xmath109 and at the following estimates of the effective junction charge @xmath110 and flux capacitance @xmath111 .",
    "notice that the above estimates fall into the range of parameters used in typical experiments for studying the single - electron tunneling effects both in jjs and jjas  @xcite suggesting thus quite an optimistic possibility to observe the above - predicted field induced effects experimentally in non - stoichiometric superconductors with pronounced networks of planar defects or in artificially prepared jjas .",
    "( it is worth mentioning that a somewhat similar behavior of the magnetic field induced charge and related flux capacitance has been observed in 2d electron systems  @xcite . )    and finally , it can be easily verified that , in view of eqs.(1)-(5 ) , the field - induced coulomb energy of the oxygen - depleted region within our model is given by @xmath112 with @xmath113 and @xmath87 defined by eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , respectively .",
    "a thorough analysis of the above expression reveals that in the pme state ( when @xmath114 ) the chemically - induced granular superconductor is always in the so - called coulomb blockade regime ( with @xmath115 ) , while in the  fishtail  state ( for @xmath116 ) the energy balance tips in favor of tunneling ( with @xmath117 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "it would be also interesting to check this phenomenon of field - induced weakening of the coulomb blockade experimentally .",
    "in conclusion , within a realistic model of 2d josephson junction arrays created by 2d network of twin boundary dislocations ( with strain fields acting as an insulating barrier between hole - rich domains in underdoped crystals ) , a few novel electric polarization related effects expected to occur in intrinsically granular material under applied magnetic fields were predicted , including a phenomenon of chemomagnetoelectricity , an anomalous low - field magnetic behavior of the effective junction charge ( and flux capacitance ) in paramagnetic meissner phase and a charge analog of `` fishtail''-like anomaly at high magnetic fields as well as field - dependent weakening of the chemically - induced coulomb blockade .",
    "the experimental conditions needed to observe the predicted here effects in non - stoichiometric high-@xmath0 superconductors were discussed .",
    "this work was done during my stay at the center for physics of fundamental interactions ( instituto superior tcnico , lisbon ) and was partially funded by the fct .",
    "i thank pedro sacramento and vitor vieira for hospitality and interesting discussions on the subject .",
    "i am also indebted to the referee for drawing my attention to the pioneer works by khaikin and khlyustikov on twinning - induced superconductivity in dislocated crystals",
