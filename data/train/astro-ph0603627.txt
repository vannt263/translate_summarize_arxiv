    "the efficiency ( @xmath2 ) of converting kinetic energy into @xmath3-rays ( @xmath4 ) is one of the most important physical parameters of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon ( zhang et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter z07 ) . in the conventional internal+external shock grb model ( rees & mszros 1994 ;",
    "kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ; see recent review by zhang & mszros 2004 ) , @xmath2 is @xmath5 ( e.g. , kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ; kumar 1999 ) , and even under some extreme assumptions , such as the extremely inhomogeneous velocity of the ejecta shells , @xmath2 is only 40% ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 , kobayashi & sari 2001 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath2 estimated with the late afterglow ( say , 10 hr after the grb trigger ) are much higher ( @xmath6 ) than the model prediction ( lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 , hereafter lz04 ) . by considering the inverse compton effect ,",
    "fan & piran ( 2006 , hereafter fp06 ) derived @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , z07 revisited this issue for 32 grbs detected by _",
    "swift _ with the early x - ray afterglow data .",
    "they derived the kinetic energy ( isotropic - equivalent ) at the end of the shallow decay phase ( @xmath8 ) and at the deceleration time of the fireball ( @xmath9 ) , and they found that @xmath2 estimated with the kinetic energy at @xmath8 is @xmath10 for most of the grbs and that the @xmath2 estimated with the kinetic energy at @xmath9 varies from a few percent to @xmath11 .",
    "these results challenge the conventional internal - shock model .",
    "the difficulty of measuring @xmath2 is the derivation of the kinetic energy ( @xmath12 ) of the afterglows , which sensitively depends on many physical parameters of the burst itself and its environment ( z07 ) .",
    "measurement of the @xmath12 with early afterglow data seems more reliable ( z07 ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the onset of afterglow from the observation .",
    "furthermore , most of the x - ray early afterglows detected by _ swift _",
    "show complex features with irregular flares ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; granot et al .",
    "2006 ) . estimating the kinetic energy with them can also introduce some uncertainties .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2007 ) systematically analyzed the prompt and early afterglow emission of 32 _ swift _ bursts and found that the grb efficiency derived with early afterglow is highly variable .",
    "this result  if not intrinsic  seems to prove the above viewpoint .",
    "the derivation of @xmath12 with the late afterglow data , on the other hand , involves some uncertainties due to the energy loss , energy injection , and jet sideways expansion effect .",
    "the advantage of the late afterglow is that this phase is steady , generally showing a smooth power - law decay . by taking the energy loss , the injection , and the jet expansion effect into account",
    ", the late afterglow may also be used for estimating @xmath2 .",
    "it is now believed that grbs arise from jets collimated into a small angle . to derive the actual radiative and kinetic energy from the observed fluence",
    ", the collimation correction has to be considered . in previous works ,",
    "the isotropic - equivalent @xmath13 and @xmath14 were used to derive the efficiency without considering this geometrical correction , which is only valid when the effect of the jet expanding sideways is ignored .",
    "however , the grb jet evolves and expands sideways with time .",
    "although this effect is not notable at a very early stage ( huang et al .",
    "2000 ) , it may affect the estimation of the efficiency @xmath2 , when one uses late afterglows at @xmath1 hr to calculate the efficiency . in this _",
    ", we investigate the jet sideways expansion effect on estimating the grb efficiency .",
    "our theoretical analysis is present in  2 .",
    "cases studies for some typical grbs are present in  3 .",
    "discussion and conclusion are presented in  4 .",
    "the @xmath2 is defined as @xmath15 assuming @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the beaming factors during the prompt and the afterglow phases , respectively , the corrected efficiency @xmath18 is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 .",
    "it can be seen that when jet angle evolution is considered , it is equivalent to increasing the @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath21 . for a double - sided jet , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the opening angles during the prompt and the afterglow phases , respectively .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution of the jet has been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. , rhoads 1997 , 1999 ; panaitescu & mszros 1999 ; sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ; moderski , sikora , & bulik 2000 ; huang et al . 2000 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "we adopt the evolution equation group presented in huang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which describes the overall evolution of relativistic grb ejecta from the an ultra - relativistic phase to a non - relativistic phase .",
    "the equations are quoted as follows : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radial coordinate in the burst source frame , @xmath3 is the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta [ @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the swept - up mass , @xmath33 is the number density of the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , @xmath34 is the mass of the proton , @xmath35 is the half - opening angle of the jet , @xmath36^{1/2}/[1+\\hat{\\gamma}(\\gamma-1)]^{1/2}\\}c$ ] is the comoving sound speed , @xmath37 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath38 is the radiation efficiency .",
    "@xmath39 is the ejecta mass that is defined by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the burst energy ( isotropic- equivalent ) , the initial half - opening angle of jet , and the initial lorentz factor , respectively .",
    "we first adopt typical parameters as follows in order to study the jet sideways effect : @xmath43=300 , @xmath41=10@xmath44 ergs , @xmath42=0.1 radians , and @xmath45 @xmath46 . in our calculation , we take @xmath24 to be the initial half - opening angle of the jet @xmath42 , and @xmath25 as the one at 10 hr . with these typical parameters , we derive the evolution of the jet opening angle , which is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we find that @xmath47 at @xmath1 hr .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 , and hence @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates that the lower the efficiency , the more significant the reduction is on the efficiency from this effect . for a burst with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , while for @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the initial parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath33 , vary between bursts .",
    "figure 1 also shows the evolution of the jet opening angle for various values of @xmath41 and @xmath33 ; @xmath18 as a function of the initial parameters is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is found that the correction to @xmath2 tends to be more significant for a burst with smaller @xmath54 , lower @xmath41 , and a denser ambient medium .",
    "= 10,000 , 100 , and 0.01 cm @xmath55 from the top to the bottom .",
    "the dashed lines are for the typical parameters with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ergs from the top to the bottom .",
    "note that the lines for @xmath59 @xmath46 and @xmath56 ergs are almost superposed . ]     in some extent of the initial parameters , which is normalized to @xmath60 and the initial parameters to the typical values .",
    "when one parameter varies , the others are taken as the typical values . ]",
    "we take two pre-_swift _ bursts , grb 980703 and grb 000926 , as examples .",
    "the microphysics parameters of the two bursts have been well constrained with high - quality broadband afterglow data ( yost et al 2003 ) . for calculating a more accurate hydrodynamic evolution , the radiative loss during the early afterglow phase can not be neglected . since the energy of the accelerated electrons behind the blast wave is lost both through the synchrotron radiation ( inverse compton cooling is neglected ) and through the expansion of the fireball , the radiative efficiency is the ratio of the synchrotron power to the total power , namely ( dai & lu 1998,1999b ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the fraction of shock energy given to the electrons , @xmath63 is the synchrotron cooling time , with @xmath64 the thompson cross section and @xmath65 the minimum lorentz factor of the random motion of electrons in the comoving frame , and @xmath66 is the comoving frame expansion time . with the numerical factor derived by fp06 , we derive @xmath67 where @xmath68}\\}^{\\frac{4}{(p+2)}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath69 is the spectral index of the electron distribution , and @xmath70 , @xmath71^{17\\epsilon_{e}/16}$ ] ; is a factor that accounts for radiative losses during the first 10 hr following the prompt phase ( sari 1997 , lz04 ) , @xmath72 is the isotropic x - ray afterglow luminosity at 10 hr ( using the value given by berger et al .",
    "2003 ) , and @xmath73 is the fraction of shock energy given to the magnetic field ( the inverse compton effect is neglected ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the isotropic kinetic energy at @xmath74 hr .    assuming the jet opening angle at 10 hour is @xmath75 , the initial kinetic energy of ejecta is @xmath76 .",
    "we thus obtain a boundary condition that when @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , in the standard model , there is a light - curve break occurring at the time ( @xmath79 ) when the bulk lorentz factor of the shock has slowed to @xmath80 ( rhoads 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "this can be taken as another boundary condition ; namely , when @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "note that the second condition may depend on the assumed initial lorentz factor .",
    "however , we find that the calculated evolutions of the lorentz factor with different assumed initial values ( from 100 to 500 ) are almost the same during the late time ( @xmath831000 s with the typical parameters ) , which is understandable . at the late time",
    ", the mass of the jet is dominated by the swept - up mass , so the initial mass of ejecta , which is defined by the initial lorentz factor with a given initial kinetic energy , weakly affects the evolution of the lorentz factor of a jet .",
    "we adjust @xmath75 and @xmath42 in a proper range until the above two boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "then the initial jet angle and the initial kinetic energy are derived , and the efficiency can be calculated .",
    "our results are listed in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the corrected efficiency is significantly lower than that derived by lz04 and fp06 .",
    "note that the @xmath12 derived in this analysis is different from lz04 and fp06 due to the different microphysics parameters used .",
    "if we use the kinetic energy that we obtain , the efficiencies of grb 980703 and grb 000926 derived with equation ( 1 ) are 0.135 and 0.103 , respectively , while with equation ( 2 ) , they are only 0.079 and 0.052 , respectively .    .",

    "we have investigated the correction on the estimate of @xmath2 by considering the jet sideways effect .",
    "our numerical study shows that for a stronger burst , a burst with a narrower jet opening angle , or a burst in a more dense environment ( dai & lu 1999a ) , this effect tends to be more significant . using the typical parameters ,",
    "the corrected efficiency may be reduced by a factor of @xmath87 for a grb with typical parameters .",
    "we use two pre-_swift _ bursts , grb 980703 and grb 000926 , as detailed case studies , further confirming our numerical analysis results .",
    "several authors argued that the efficiencies of some _ swift _ bursts with long time x - ray flattening are as high as @xmath8875%- 90% ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; ioka et al .",
    "2006 ; granot et al . 2006 ) and that the internal - shock model for grbs meets the challenge of a so - called efficiency crisis ( e.g. , ioka et al .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , the estimate of the grb efficiency is strongly affected by many effects and depends on unobservable physical parameters . as we show in this analysis , the small jet sideways effect may result in a considerable reduction of the efficiency .",
    "more recently , zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimated the kinetic energy with the data of early afterglows , such as the deceleration time ( when the blast wave is decelerated ) . from the end of grb to the deceleration time , the jet sideways expansion is insignificant , and thus this effect on the estimate of the grb efficiency can be negligible",
    ". however , they found that the derived grb efficiency is highly variable from a few percent to @xmath8990% ( at the deceleration time ) .",
    "if these results are intrinsic but not caused by a parameter selection effect or by the uncertainties of early afterglows , they may refresh our understanding of the grb phenomenon , and they may require an improvement in the conventional shock model .",
