    "the moderately high @xmath6 gev hadron spectra in central au+au collisions , especially @xmath7 production  @xcite , reported at this conference , reveal a 5 - 8 fold suppression compared to the expectation based on pqcd as we show below .",
    "this suppression can be explained by the energy loss of moderate @xmath8 gev gluon mini - jets , the so - called `` jet - quenching '' effect predicted a decade ago as a signature of the production of high density matter with dense colored sources  @xcite .",
    "the observation of jet quenching is one of the major new results from rhic not observed before at lower sps and ags energies .",

    "recently the qcd radiative energy loss was solved to all orders in opacity @xmath1 in  @xcite .",
    "previous work bdms  @xcite , based on asymptotic energy and thick target approximations led to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the color casimir of the jet ( @xmath11 for gluons ) , and @xmath12 is a transport coefficient of the medium proportional to the parton density , @xmath13 .",
    "the factor , @xmath14 depends logarithmically on @xmath15 and the mean free path , @xmath16 , namely @xmath17 . note that it is the radiated gluon mean free path , @xmath16 , that enters above .    ) is approximately constant at medium energy , @xmath18 gev .",

    "a recent calculation  @xcite confirmed the validity of the glv energy dependence .",
    "we illustrate here the non - abelian energy loss for an idealized static plasma with an average screening scale @xmath22  gev , @xmath23 , and an average gluon mean free path @xmath24  fm .",
    "the numerical results for the first order energy loss @xmath25 , taking into account the finite kinematic bounds are displayed in figs . 1 - 2 for different opacities @xmath26 . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite the first order opacity result reproduces the characteristic bdms quadratic dependence of the energy loss on @xmath15 .    however , the most important feature of fig .",
    "2 relative to observable consequences of energy loss is that unlike in the asymptotic bdms case , where @xmath27 increases rapidly with decreasing energy , the structure of the first order expression as well as finite kinematic bounds in the glv expression lead to an approximate _ linear _ energy dependence of @xmath25 in the energy range , @xmath28 gev and a slow @xmath29 decease at much higher energies .",
    "in order to investigate the influence of the glv energy - dependent radiative energy loss on hadron production , we apply a pqcd based description of au+au collisions , including energy loss prior to hadronization . in refs .",
    "@xcite we displayed how pqcd calculations can reproduce the experimental data in p+p @xmath30+x reactions .",
    "our calculations incorporate the parton transverse momentum ( `` intrinsic @xmath31 '' ) via a gaussian transverse momentum distribution ( characterized by the width @xmath32 )  @xcite .    in the pqcd calculation of nuclear collisions",
    "shadowing will modify the parton distribution functions ( pdf - s ) in the nucleons inside the nucleus .",
    "these modified pdf - s are denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the finite size of the colliding nuclei implies an impact parameter dependence .",
    "the influence of hadronic multiscattering is investigated in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .    considering the energy loss effect",
    ", jet quenching reduces the energy of the jet before fragmentation .",
    "we concentrate on mid - rapidity ( @xmath35 ) , where the jet transverse momentum before fragmentation is shifted by the energy loss  @xcite , @xmath36 .",
    "this shifts the @xmath37 parameter in the fragmentation function of the integrand ( [ fullaa ] ) to @xmath38 .    with these elements",
    "the invariant cross section of hadron production in central @xmath0 collision is given by @xmath39 where upper limit of the impact parameter integral is @xmath40 fm for 10 % central au+au collisions . here",
    "@xmath41 is the usual ( glauber ) thickness function .",
    "the factor @xmath42 appears because of the in - medium modification of the fragmentation function  @xcite .",
    "thus , the invariant cross section ( [ fullaa ] ) will depend on the average opacity or collision number , @xmath43 .",

    "we note that in contrast to previous energy independent estimates for the energy loss , the glv energy - dependent energy loss leads to constant suppression of the high @xmath46 domain in agreement with the preliminary data .",
    "the peripheral collisions are consistent with a rather small opacity in contrast to central collisions as expected . the ratio of central to peripheral phenix  @xcite data shown in fig .",
    "4 clearly reveals that jet quenching at rhic overcomes the cronin enhancement at zero ( final state ) opacity .",
    "this is in stark contrast to data at sps energies , where wa98 found no evidence for quenching in @xmath47 at 160 agev but a factor of two cronin enhancement ( see talk of x.n .",
    "wang ) .    in summary ,",
    "3 - 4 indicate that an effective static plasma opacity @xmath48 is sufficient to reproduce the striking jet quenching pattern observed at rhic . in the talk of wang ,",
    "a rather small constant @xmath49 gev / fm was also found to be consistent with the data .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that these effective _ static _ plasma opacities and parameters hide the underlying rapid dilution of the plasma due to expansion .",
    "the glv formalism including the kinematic constraints at first order has been further generalized to include effects of expansion in  @xcite .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that the inclusion of longitudinal expansion modifies the static plasma results in such a way that the moderate static plasma opacity actually implies that the produced mini - jet plasma rapidity density may have reached @xmath50 .",
    "if confirmed by further measurements and theoretical refinements , jet quenching may have already provided the first evidence that initial parton densities on the order of 100 times nuclear matter density are produced at rhic .",
    "the full analysis of flavor composition , shape , and azimuthal moments of the high @xmath46 spectra appears to be a promising diagnostic probe of the evolution of the gluon plasma produced at rhic .",
