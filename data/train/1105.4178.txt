    "among the nearby neutron stars known , seven show emission that appears predominantly thermal , with inferred temperatures of @xmath0k . these so - called isolated neutron stars ( inss ) are young , @xmath1myr old , and the thermal emission",
    "is thought to be due to residual heat as their x - ray luminosities are considerably more than their spin - down luminosities @xmath2 .",
    "they differ from similarly aged pulsars not only in the absence of non - thermal radio and x - ray emission , but also in their long , 310s spin periods and large , @xmath3 g magnetic fields ( for reviews , @xcite ) .",
    "the inss have attracted much attention , in part because of the hope that their properties could be used to constrain the poorly understood behavior of matter in their ultra - dense interiors : since the details of the neutron star s interior affect its radius @xcite and cooling history @xcite , the wide range of theoretical possibilities can be limited with data . in this respect ,",
    "the thermal emission from inss is particularly interesting , since one might derive constraints on mass , radius , and cooling history from spectral properties such as effective temperature , surface gravity , and gravitational redshift .",
    "progress has been stymied , however , by difficulties in interpreting the observed spectra : at present , both the composition and state of matter in the photosphere remain unknown , with hydrogen , helium , and mid - z elements ( o , n , ne , etc . ) in states ranging from gaseous to condensed all being considered ( see , e.g. , contributions to @xcite ) .",
    "below , we use the brightest and best studied ins to illustrate those problems and the part played by optical and ultraviolet measurements .",
    "the emission of inss was known to be roughly thermal , but it came as a major surprise when long _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ observations found that the spectrum of the brightest ins , rx  j1856.5@xmath43754 , could be reproduced with a featureless black body ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for the surprise was that , for a light element ( h or he ) atmosphere , the spectrum may be featureless but the high - energy tail should be harder than a wien tail ( because opacity decreases towards higher energies and hence one should see deeper , hotter layers ) , while for heavier elements , the overall shape may be blackbody - like but spectral features should be present .    c c c c c 0420.0@xmath45022 & acs / wfc f475w & 2009 - 10 - 24 & 2424 & @xmath5 + & acs / sbc f140lp & 2009 - 12 - 16 & 2856 & @xmath6 + 0806.4@xmath44123 & acs / wfc f475w & 2010 - 05 - 19 & 4868 & @xmath7 + & acs / sbc f140lp & 2009 - 12 - 15 & 5692 & @xmath8 + 1308.6 + 2127 & acs / wfc f475w & 2009 - 08 - 08 & 4676 & @xmath9 + & acs / sbc f140lp & 2009 - 08 - 06 & 5504 & @xmath10 + 1605.3 + 3249 & acs / wfc f606w & 2005 - 02 - 06 & 4728 & @xmath11",

    "the suggestion of a quark star , however , ignored that the optical and ultraviolet measurements were inconsistent with a single blackbody , being in excess by a factor @xmath16 over the extrapolation of the x - rays ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and see fig .",
    "[ fig : ox ] ) . this excess has been taken as evidence for two regions on the surface : a hotter one primarily responsible for the x - ray emission , and a larger , cooler one responsible for the optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the context of this model ,",
    "the radius is not small but rather puzzlingly large .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the x - ray pulsations is surprisingly tiny @xcite .    as an alternative",
    ", it has been suggested that the surface is condensed , but covered by a thin gaseous layer of hydrogen ( see @xcite ; also @xcite ) .",
    "hydrogen can unify the optical and x - ray emission , since compared to a blackbody , a hydrogen atmosphere will appear to show an optical excess by an amount that depends on the magnetic field strength @xcite , and the pulsations will be determined by non - uniformities in the temperature @xcite . for a thick hydrogen atmosphere one expects a high - energy tail , but a suitably thin atmosphere will be transparent at high energies , allowing one to see the blackbody - like emission from the condensed surface below .    by construction , the above model reproduces the spectrum .",
    "but it has other advantages : ( i ) it resolves the problem of the small radius : because of its non - gray opacities , the temperature is smaller and the radius larger than for a pure blackbody model ; ( ii ) for the dipolar magnetic field of @xmath17 g @xcite , a heavy - element surface could indeed be condensed @xcite , though we note that the field is stronger than inferred by @xcite ; ( iii ) for other inss , hydrogen might be responsible for the observed spectral features ( see @xcite ) ; and ( iv ) the appearance of a thin layer of hydrogen may be the easiest explanation for the change in spectrum observed for rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  @xcite",
    ".    while promising , this model arguably is contrived , and certainly for rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  it leaves it unclear how to proceed to test it .",
    "fortunately , however , the other inss provide much more information .      for the hydrogen models described above  and generally for atmospheric models ",
    "the optical excess depends on the magnetic field strength . for rx  j1856.5@xmath43754 , the field",
    "could only be constrained by the absence of x - ray absorption features , but for other sources the situation is better : these have absorption features , which any model will have to reproduce simultaneously with the optical excess , and at field strengths consistent with those derived from timing .",
    "for all inss , optical counterparts have been searched for in deep optical observations , leading to four secure identifications and two likely identifications .",
    "so far , apart from rx  j1856.5@xmath43754 , only for the second - brightest ins , rx  j0720.4@xmath43125 , has the full optical to uv range been probed .",
    "the interpretation is difficult , though , partly because the fluxes are somewhat inconsistent with those of a rayleigh - jeans spectrum @xcite , and partly because , uniquely among the inss , its x - ray spectrum changed ( which poses problems and possibilities all of its own ; @xcite ) .",
    "the possible presence of non - thermal emission in the optical , also suggested for rx  j1605.3 + 3249  @xcite , makes it difficult to interpret the optical emission .",
    "however , for rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  and rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  the ultraviolet emission does seem completely thermal .",
    "this is similar to what is found for comparably - aged radio pulsars such as psr  b0656 + 14 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and geminga @xcite .",
    "( note , though , that for those pulsars the ultraviolet emission is generally consistent with the x - ray extrapolation . )    given the above , we obtained _ hst _",
    "optical and uv photometry for those five inss that had not been studied in detail before .",
    "we complemented this with other _",
    "photometry for the inss ( reanalyzing the data where necessary ) ; we restrict our analysis to _ hst _  data both for the high signal - to - noise that it often implies as well as the uniform quality of the calibration .",
    "in section  [ sec : obs ] we present our new data , and give details concerning the identification and photometry of the counterparts . in section  [ sec : cpt ]",
    ", we compare our results to previous ( usually ground - based ) searches , and perform detailed spectral fitting of the optical / uv data for all 7 inss , with and without reference to the x - ray spectra .",
    "we present our discussion and conclusions in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "of the seven confirmed inss discovered by _",
    "rosat _ , three do not have confirmed optical counterparts : for rx  j0420.0@xmath45022  and rx  j1308.6 + 2127 , the associations are based only on positional coincidence , without confirmation based on spectrum or proper motion . furthermore , rx  j1605.3 + 3249and rx  j2143.0 + 0654  did not have ultraviolet photometry .",
    "we observed all of these with _ hst _  in the optical and ultraviolet .",
    "a log of the observations and our photometry are given in table  [ tab : hst_obs ] .",
    "the data for each of the five targets consist of multiple exposures covering the sdss @xmath18 band ( f475w filter , centered near 4700 ) with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) wide field channel ( wfc ) and the near - uv ( f140lp filter , centered near 1500 ) with the acs solar blind channel ( sbc ) .",
    "for both the wfc and sbc data we used four sub - pixel dithered exposures per orbit and 13 orbits per object ; for the wfc the object was placed at the center of the wfc1 detector so that we did not have to deal with the gap between the detectors . for completeness , we also re - analyzed the acs / wfc f606w data on rx  j1605.3 + 3249 , since no photometry is given in the original publication by @xcite .",
    "wfc images obtained after servicing mission 4 ( sm4 ) show charge trails along the ccd columns and faint stripes along the rows .",
    "the charge trails are due to the ccds degrading charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) , while the stripes reflect a problem in the new electronics .",
    "these artifacts can significantly affect the detection of very faint sources as well as photometry and astrometry .",
    "we used the tasks ` acs_destripe ` ( version 0.2.1 ) and ` ctecorr ` ( also version 0.2.1 , with the reference file ` pctefile_101109.fits ` ; see @xcite ) to correct the images , finding noticeably improvements in appearance .",
    "checking the resulting photometry against that of raw images , we confirmed the conclusions of @xcite that their algorithm restores photometric accuracy .",
    "comparing against the average cte corrections computed by @xcite , we found good agreement , although with some scatter ( again , similar to what was found by @xcite ) .",
    "for the f606w data on rx  j1605.3 + 3249 , taken before sm4 , the stripes are not present and we could not use the pixel - based cte correction since the data were taken before sm4 and would require different calibration parameters , but other methods are possible to correct the reduced cte losses .",
    "the sbc data do not suffer from such artifacts .    for each source in table  [ tab : hst_obs ]",
    ", ` destriped ' and cte - corrected ( as necessary ) images were drizzled using ` multidrizzle ` @xcite onto a single image .",
    "we experimented with the drizzle parameters to balance resolution and uniformity of sampling , settling on a set that gave good image quality : for the wfc data we used a final pixel scale of @xmath19 and a pixel fraction of 0.9 , while for sbc we used a pixel scale of @xmath20 and a pixel fraction of 0.9 .",
    "we verified that our photometry did not depend on the choices that we made .",
    "for all inss , the sbc images show an obvious , rather bright counterpart , with at best a few other faint sources present .",
    "in contrast , in the wfc images , the counterparts are faint and there are many other , brighter stars .",
    "previous identification of optical counterparts to the inss has relied on absolute astrometry using the positions measured in x - rays and approximate ties between the x - ray and optical coordinate systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this can lead to uncertainties , as the absolute x - ray positions are typically accurate to only @xmath21 or so .",
    "however , the sbc images allow us to conclusively identify the counterparts with much higher accuracy . to do so we started by registering the sbc and wfc images . in two cases",
    ", we estimated offsets from single , bright optical stars that had faint ultraviolet counterparts , while in the others we relied on diffuse emission from galaxies ( smoothing the sbc and wfc data as necessary to isolate a single bright component ) .    in all cases",
    "the registration was unambiguous , and led to clear identifications of the optical counterparts to the inss .",
    "the sbc and wfc positions matched to within @xmath22 ( since they were taken at most 7months apart , a typical proper motion of @xmath23 would lead to a comparable intrinsic offset ) .                for all of the wfc images , we then registered the astrometry to 2mass @xcite .",
    "we fit for a shift only , leaving the plate - scale and rotation as set by the drizzling software . in the case of rx  j0806.4@xmath44123",
    ", we used 49 stars , restricted to being on the same detector ( wfc1 ) as the presumed counterpart .",
    "for the other images , many fewer stars were available , and we used between 1 and 4 ( all unsaturated and with stellar profiles ) . from the star - to - star variations ,",
    "we infer that our absolute astrometry is accurate to @xmath24 only , but this suffices to show that the positions of the identified counterparts agreed with published x - ray positions ( and generally with previous identifications ; see sect .  [",
    "sec : cpt ] ) .",
    "we defer more accurate relative and absolute astrometry to a later paper .",

    "based on @xcite , the aperture correction from @xmath46 to infinite radius for the f475w filter is @xmath50mag .",
    "there is a small correction to our aperture correction , since some of the light from the stellar psf will appear in the sky annulus .",

    "source photometry was done within a radius of @xmath53 , and we used an aperture correction of @xmath54mag , based on the work of @xcite that contains about 20% of the light , according to the acs data handbook ( http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/handbooks/datahandbookv5/acs_ch62.html#111354 ) , accounting for the large magnitude of the aperture correction . while our targets do not have enough counts for very accurate profiles out to these radii , a comparison of all of the stars agrees reasonably well with the aperture corrections from @xcite for a wavelength of 1500 . ] .",
    "given the large aperture correction and the possibility of scattered light beyond @xmath55 , we include a 5% systematic uncertainty on our sbc photometry based on the scatter between the psfs of the different objects .",

    "we do not undertake here to resolve this , but note that there is no evidence for variability or non - power - law optical - uv seds in the _ hst _  data we use below .",
    "we suspect that the discrepancies reflect mostly the more than usual care required to obtain reliable ground - based measurements for very faint objects ( see , e.g. , the discussion for rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  in @xcite ) .      as in @xcite and similar papers ,",

    "detailed fitting of _ hst _  data for the inss presents some difficulties , since the zero - point fluxes were determined for a spectrum that is flat in @xmath75 , while the inss have much steeper spectra .",
    "given the often very wide bandpasses used , this leads to substantial changes in effective wavelength .        to circumvent these difficulties",
    ", we relied on ` synphot ` to compute the expected stmag as a function of extinction @xmath76 and power - law index @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 , where a rayleigh - jeans spectrum would have @xmath79 ) on a fine grid , with steps 0.005mag in @xmath76 and 0.025 in @xmath77 .",
    "then , for each object , we fitted a power law , optimizing for @xmath77 and normalization , but keeping the reddening @xmath76 fixed to the value implied by the column density @xmath80 determined from fits to the x - ray spectrum : @xmath81 ( @xcite ; note that this relation varies for different sight lines , but the extinction is small enough that the variations do not influence our results qualitatively , as we show below ) .",
    "we use the extinction curve of @xcite , implemented as ` gal3 ` in ` synphot ` , and we assume @xmath82 . we note that we can not fit uniquely for @xmath76 based only on our data , as the amount of reddening",
    "is highly degenerate with the power - law index .",
    "the exact value of @xmath80 ( and hence @xmath76 ) that we used depends somewhat on the calibration of the x - ray data and on the assumed spectral model , and could change in the future .",
    "we discuss this explicitly below .",
    "the results of our power - law fits are shown in with table  [ tab : plfit ] and figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "our uncertainties and @xmath83 values include a 5% systematic uncertainty for the f140lp data , owing to uncertainties in the aperture correction . for those objects with only two measurements",
    "we are left with a fully constrained fit ( 0 degrees - of - freedom ) ; for the others , @xmath83 is consistent with a good fit .",
    "the precise results depend slightly on our choice of extinction , but the results do not change qualitatively , since the extinctions inferred from the x - ray column densities are small ( @xmath84mag , and thus @xmath85mag ) .",
    "indeed , given the quoted uncertainties on @xmath80 , the changes are nearly negligible .",
    "somewhat larger systematic changes are possible from changes in the reddening law , the ratio of @xmath80 to @xmath76 , or the assumed x - ray spectral model .",
    "therefore , in table  [ tab : plfit ] we also give @xmath86 : the change in the power - law slope with changes in extinction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note , though , that even a 50% change in @xmath76 would generally change @xmath77 by less than  0.1 .",
    "one of the main purposes of our work is to establish reliable estimates of the `` optical excess , '' the factor by which the optical / uv flux of the ins exceed the extrapolation of the x - ray blackbodies .",
    "to do this , we have collected the best - fit x - ray spectra for all 7 inss in table  [ tab : xray ] . in most cases",
    "the best - fit spectra are not purely blackbodies , but for the purposes of extrapolation the blackbody component is sufficient .",
    "we note that the spectrum of rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  changed during 2003 @xcite . while there is no evidence that the optical flux of rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  changed during that time @xcite , the two different x - ray spectra differ by a factor of 1.54 from each other , thus introducing a systematic uncertainty into our inferred optical / uv excess .",
    "it does not , however , affect the shape of the excess , as the _ hst _  data are well into the rayleigh - jeans tail and uncertainties in the extinction are small .    for all of the objects we determine the excess relative to expected fluxes calculated by passing",
    "the extrapolated , reddened x - ray spectrum through the _ hst _  filter response curves , using ` synphot ` .",
    "this avoids issues of uncertainties in the effective wavelengths or zero - point flux that come from using spectra that differ significantly in slope from the calibration spectra .",
    "we determined formal uncertainties by repeating the above for values that differ by 1-@xmath87 in all parameters from the best - fit spectrum , taking as 1-@xmath87 uncertainties on the extrapolated magnitudes the maximum and minimum of these variations .",
    "we list our results in tables  [ tab : extrap ] and [ tab : extrap2 ] . for completeness ,",
    "we include expected values for instrument / filter / object combinations beyond those used here , and also give reference photometry for an unabsorbed @xmath88k blackbody as well as approximate values for the wavelength - dependent extinction @xmath89 ( see @xcite for an extended discussion ) .",
    "the extinction values actually depend slightly on the value of the overall extinction @xmath76 , since this changes the shape of the spectrum and hence the integral over the filter response .",
    "the effect is largest for the widest filters , like stis/50ccd .",
    "however , for the range of extinction values considered here ( @xmath90 corresponds to @xmath91 ) , the changes are less than 1% in @xmath89 .    along with the more easily assessed uncertainties on @xmath92 and @xmath93 , a possibly significant systematic uncertainty in our model is variations in extinction .",
    "similar to the analysis above , we explore this issue by considering a @xmath94% range on @xmath76 around the nominal value .",
    "this results in uncertainties on the extrapolated photometry ranging from 0.09mag ( for the shortest wavelengths ) to 0.03mag ( for the longest ) , based on a fiducial @xmath95 . for other values of @xmath80 ,",

    "no source has a slope that is significantly steeper than rayleigh - jeans .    comparing the emission to the x - ray spectrum",
    ", there is a similarly wide variation in both the amount and slope of the optical / uv excess : most sources are not consistent with the constant excess of rx  j1856.5@xmath43754 , and the amount of the excess varies significantly , although no source has measurements below its x - ray extrapolation . at 1500",
    "the range is from about 3.5 to almost 10 , with statistically significant variation ( @xmath183 for 6 dof ) even when excluding rx  j2143.0 + 0654  ( @xmath184 for 5 dof ) . at longer wavelengths the variation is even larger , going from 6 to 50 at 4700 . here ,",
    "rx  j2143.0 + 0654  is clearly very different from the rest , but again when excluding it there is still significant variation ( @xmath185 for 5 dof ) .",
    "these are beyond deviations possible from the x - ray uncertainties , and while x - ray calibration errors , differences in x - ray fitting methodology , and variability can all contribute to variations in the excess , as noted above the shape of the excess is robust .",
    "see figure  [ fig : ox ] for a full optical - to - x - ray comparison of rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  and rx  j2143.0 + 0654 .",
    "if the x - ray and optical came from different regions on the surface @xcite , we might expect variations in the excess to correlate with changes in the x - ray pulsed fraction , as both would be dependent on geometry : a small x - ray hotspot would give rise to both a large optical excess and a large pulsed fraction .",
    "some allowances could be made for viewing angles , but with 7 sources this would start to average out .",
    "however , we do not see any such correlation . as an example , both rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  and rx  j0420.0@xmath45022  have similar optical excesses , but the pulsed fraction for rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  is about 1% @xcite while that of rx  j0420.0@xmath45022  is 13% @xcite , and rx  j1605.3 + 3249  has a larger excess but a small pulsed fraction .",
    "even so , we can still fit the optical / uv seds as part of some blackbody , with radius and temperature free ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bbfit ] ) . for rx",
    "j1856.5@xmath43754  this is largely degenerate ( since it looks like a rayleigh - jeans ) , but for other sources the temperature and hence the radius are constrained .",
    "some of these ( mostly rx  j0420.0@xmath45022 ) are not likely based on extrapolations to the x - ray band , as they would exceed the flux at 100ev .",
    "all fits are generally consistent with reduced @xmath186 , although there are not many degrees of freedom .",
    "this fit gives a normalization of @xmath187 for rx  j2143.0 + 0654 .",
    "since we expect a distance to rx  j2143.0 + 0654  of 5001000pc based on the x - ray spectrum , this would imply a rather large radius if it is interpreted physically , and may only apply in light of the scattering model discussed below .",
    "most of the objects fall on a single locus with radius increasing as the temperature decreases .",
    "much of this just comes from keeping a similar excess among the sources ( we would expect @xmath188 ) , but it is clear that rx  j1605.3 + 3249  and rx  j2143.0 + 0654  are inconsistent with the other objects .",
    "we saw above that the optical excess does not appear to correlate with the x - ray pulsed fraction , suggesting that a model like @xcite is incomplete . taking the basic spectral parameters ( @xmath92 along with energy of the absorption lines ) and the basic rotational parameter ( pulsed fraction , magnetic field , spin - down luminosity ) we see no clear trends with the optical / uv properties that we have measured here .",
    "the one possible exception is in relating the spectral index to @xmath92 : in figure  [ fig : ktslope ] it appears that the hotter objects have smaller spectral indices .",
    "much of this correlation comes from rx  j2143.0 + 0654 , but even without it the correlation appears somewhat significant : spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xcite for all objects is @xmath189 with a null - hypothesis probability of 5% , and this drops to @xmath190 ( 21% null hypothesis probability ) when rx  j2143.0 + 0654  is excluded .",
    "for the small number of objects considered here , this is reasonable but not definitive .",
    "such a correlation may imply that the seds of all of the inss deviate from a rayleigh - jeans tail , but that the energy at which they do it depends on their temperatures .",
    "for the cool rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  and rx  j0420.0@xmath45022 , the optical / uv window still seems thermal .",
    "but for the hotter rx  j1308.6 + 2127  and rx  j2143.0 + 0654 , the thermal portion would be lost shortward of 1000 .",
    "the shift does not appear linear , as measuring the excess at a wavelength that scales with @xmath191 does not improve the agreement among objects .",
    "in contrast to some previous attempts to measure the optical sed using both ground- and space - based measurements , we see that all inss are well fit by a single power - law .",
    "further , our results using only _ hst _ data are similar to those for rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  and rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  that include ground - based data .",
    "our conclusions regarding the 5 sources observed here are relatively insensitive to @xmath192month scale variability , as in many ( but not all ) of the cases the optical and uv observations occurred within weeks of each other , but this is not always the case .",
    "for instance , rx  j1605.3 + 3249  now has more _ hst _  photometry than rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  spanning almost 10 years , but still appears smooth .",
    "whether this implies that the optical / uv is constant or just that we are unlucky is not clear , but future high - quality measurements should be able to address this .",
    "previous modeling of rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  @xcite could not distinguish between a single non - thermal power - law and a combination of power - laws .",
    "unfortunately , with our new data it is still hard to make that distinction , as the wide wavelength gap between the optical and uv even in the best case ( rx  j1605.3 + 3249 ) could easily hide a curved sed .",
    "future observations in the 20003000  range might help better constrain such spectra and settle this question .",
    "we note , though , while the sources with few data - points can accommodate a power - law as flat as that for rx  j2143.0 + 0654  in addition to a steeper , thermal component , objects with denser coverage like rx  j0720.4@xmath43125  and rx  j1605.3 + 3249  can not",
    ".    we can set rough upper limits on another power - law by requiring that any non - thermal contribution match our reddest optical point as well as be below the x - ray black body at 1.5kev , where typically there are no more counts ( figure  [ fig : ox ] ) .",
    "we also require that such a power - law have a slope such that it is falling in photons per unit energy toward higher energies , so that it stays hidden ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". taken together with the parallax for rx  j1856.5@xmath43754  @xcite and assuming all the inss have similar radii , we find non - thermal luminosities integrated over the 210kev band of typically @xmath193 .",
    "at the upper end we do not believe that such luminosities could be real , as they would be close to 100% of @xmath2 , in contrast to radio pulsars that have non - thermal luminosities of @xmath194 in x - rays @xcite .",
    "even without such an extrapolation our optical luminosities ( @xmath195 ) are uncomfortably high for a typical magnetospheric origin , since it would be @xmath196 compared to typical values of ratios of @xmath197@xmath198 for radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "however , while the x - ray emission can not be powered by @xmath2 ( since x - ray luminosities are @xmath199 ; @xcite ) some amount of the optical emission could be related , albeit with a different mechanism than that which usually operates for pulsars .",
    "if the deviations from a thermal sed were from magnetospheric emission as in pulsars @xcite , we might expect a correlation in the amount of the excess or the optical luminosity with the spin - down luminosity @xmath2 , as this is what drives the x - ray power - laws seen in pulsars and may drive the optical too .",
    "again , though , we see no such correlation .",
    "the behavior of the inss also deviates from what is seen in the cases of other relatively young neutron stars in the optical , namely magnetars @xcite .",
    "most magnetars have only been seen in the infrared ( likely due to high extinctions ) .",
    "the infrared emission is variable , and may or may not be linked to the x - ray emission .",
    "the one source with confirmed optical emission is 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite .",
    "the optical emission is known to pulse at the x - ray period @xcite , suggesting that it is likely magnetospheric in origin @xcite .",
    "importantly for this comparison , the optical emission is not a single power - law @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the emission of the inss is well fit by a single power - law and is ( so far ) constant in time .",
    "the flattening of the sed of rx  j2143.0 + 0654  toward longer wavelengths is somewhat suggestive of the broadband sed of 4u  0142 + 61 , but the other characteristics make it distinct .",
    "it may be that the similarities with magnetars arise from a common origin , which suggests that the optical emission results from resonant scattering in the neutron stars magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "however , qualitative differences between the inss and magnetars exist : while the ranges overlap , the magnetars typically have higher values of magnetic to thermal energy @xmath200 ( @xmath201 for the magnetars vs.  @xmath202 for the inss ) , and the higher fields of the magnetars mean that scattering and pair - production happen much more quickly",
    ". the optical emission of the inss could instead be from an inverted temperature layer ( like a chromosphere ) that is driven by a twisted magnetosphere ( c.  thompson 2011 , pers .",
    "we note that for rx  j2143.0 + 0654 , which has the most extreme optical excess , we also see that the x - ray pulsations have odd harmonics likely indicative of a complex field geometry @xcite .      in the context of magnetized atmosphere models for neutron stars ,",
    "the amount of optical / uv excess can depend on the magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore we examined the uv / optical emission predicted by the nsmax models of ns x - ray spectra constructed for ` xspec ` @xcite ; these models span the range @xmath203 g and @xmath204ev for a partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "we find that , although the magnitude of the flux differs from that of a blackbody , the wavelength dependence still exhibits a @xmath205 rayleigh - jeans behavior .",
    "deviations from the rayleigh - jeans behavior occur as a result of the proton cyclotron line at ( redshifted ) @xmath206  ( with @xmath207 g ) . for @xmath208",
    "g , the wings of the cyclotron line can reproduce the wavelength - behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] , though not at the magnitude of rx  j2143.0 + 0654 ; however , it is unclear how strongly this behavior depends on temperature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ktslope ] ) . if the deviations from rayleigh - jeans are due to absorption in the wings of the proton cyclotron line , these spectrally - inferred magnetic fields are much lower than those inferred from timing @xcite .",
    "a factor of two increase in the former may be the result of a helium ( rather than hydrogen ) atmosphere .",
    "a possible discrepancy between timing and spectral magnetic fields may exist when considering the broad x - ray absorption features @xcite but there it is in the opposite direction ( the features are more consistent with strong fields ) , and hence easier to understand in terms of higher - order magnetic moments leading to locally stronger magnetic fields .",
    "we also note that our models indicate an increasing flux with increasing wavelength similar in magnitude to that seen in the inss ( again except for rx  j2143.0 + 0654 ) for @xmath209ev and magnetic fields more similar to what is seen in x - ray timing , @xmath210 g ; the cause of this is still under investigation .",
