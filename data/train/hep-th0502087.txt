    "the computation of fermion determinants in nontrivial background fields is an important challenge for both continuum and lattice quantum field theory .",
    "explicit analytic results are known only for very simple backgrounds , and are essentially all variations on the original work of heisenberg and euler @xcite . for applications in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , an important class of background gauge fields are instanton fields , as these minimize the euclidean gauge action within a given topological sector of the gauge field .",
    "furthermore , instanton physics has many important phenomenological consequences @xcite .",
    "thus , we are led to consider the fermion determinant , and the associated one - loop effective action , for quarks of mass @xmath0 in an instanton background . here , no exact results are known for the full mass dependence , although several terms have been computed analytically in the small mass @xcite and large mass @xcite limits .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the present authors presented a new computation which is numerical , but essentially exact , that evaluates the one - loop effective action in a single instanton background , for any value of the quark mass ( and for arbitrary instanton size parameter ) .",
    "the result is fully consistent with the known small and large mass limits , and interpolates smoothly between these limits .",
    "this could be of interest for the extrapolation of lattice results @xcite , obtained at unphysically large quark masses , to lower physical masses , and for various instanton - based phenomenology .",
    "our computational method is simple and efficient , and can be adapted to many other determinant computations in which the background is sufficiently symmetric so that the problem can be reduced to a product of one - dimensional radial determinants .",
    "while this is still a very restricted set of background field configurations , it contains many examples of interest , the single instanton being one of the most obvious .",
    "it is well known how to compute determinants of _ ordinary _ differential operators @xcite ; but in higher - dimensional problems with _ partial _ differential operators , one must confront the renormalization problem since there are now an infinite number of 1-d determinants to deal with ( even when the partial differential operator has a radial symmetry ) .    in this paper",
    "we present more details of the results of @xcite . in section [ renormalized ]",
    "we define the renormalized effective action in the minimal subtraction scheme , as introduced by t hooft @xcite , and summarize what is known about the small and large mass limits . in section [ radial ]",
    "we review how the single instanton background reduces the spectral problem to a set of radial problems , and indicate how to regularize the effective action .",
    "this reduces the computation to two parts , one of which is analytic and the other is numerical .",
    "the analytic part concerns the renormalization of the effective action , and for this we use a wkb expansion as is developed in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we stress that this renormalization computation , which constitutes section [ wkbsection ] , is analytic and exact , even though we use a wkb expansion , since we show that only the first two orders of the wkb expansion contribute .",
    "section [ numerical ] presents details of the numerical part of the computation and shows how to combine the numerical part of the computation with the renormalization part to obtain the finite renormalized effective action , which is plotted in figure [ fig5 ] . in section [ comparison ]",
    "we present a simple interpolating function that has been fit to our results , and we also compare our precise mass dependence with the mass dependence of the leading derivative expansion approximation , which was computed previously in @xcite . the final section contains some concluding comments . in appendix",
    "a we give some details ( not fully given in @xcite ) which are needed in the approximate effective action calculation using the wkb phase - shift method . for this wkb analysis ,",
    "the schwinger proper - time framework @xcite provides a natural way to implement the renormalization procedure consistently .",
    "appendix b confirms that the same result is obtained in the regular and singular gauges for the instanton background .",
    "an instanton background field is self - dual , and self - dual gauge fields have the remarkable property that the dirac and klein - gordon operators in such a background are isospectral ; that is , they have identical spectra , apart from an extra degeneracy factor of four in the spinor case and zero modes present in the spinor case @xcite .",
    "since the one - loop effective action is proportional to the logarithm of the determinant of the respective operator , this has the immediate consequence that it is sufficient to consider the scalar effective action to learn also about the corresponding fermionic effective action , for any mass value m. in particular , for a quark in a background instanton field , the renormalized one - loop effective action of a dirac spinor field of mass @xmath0 ( and isospin @xmath1 ) , @xmath2 , can be related to the corresponding scalar effective action , @xmath3 , for a complex scalar of mass @xmath0 ( and isospin @xmath1 ) by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the renormalization scale .",
    "the ln term in ( [ susy ] ) corresponds to the existence of a zero eigenvalue in the spectrum of the dirac operator for a single instanton background .",
    "the one - loop effective action must be regularized .",
    "we choose pauli - villars regularization adapted to the schwinger proper - time formalism , and later we relate this to dimensional regularization , as in the work of t hooft @xcite .",
    "the pauli - villars regularized one - loop scalar effective action is @xcite @xmath6.\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . in ( [ det ] ) , @xmath9 is a heavy regulator mass .",
    "we consider an su(2 ) single instanton in the regular gauge @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the standard t hooft symbols @xcite .",
    "the regularized effective action ( [ det ] ) has the proper - time representation @xmath12 the renormalized effective action , in the minimal subtraction scheme , is defined as @xcite @xmath13 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\lim_{\\lambda\\rightarrow\\infty } \\left[\\gamma_{\\lambda}^{s}(a;m)-\\frac{1}{6 } \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}\\right)\\right]\\quad , \\label{renaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have subtracted the charge renormalization counter - term , and @xmath5 is the renormalization scale . by dimensional considerations , we may introduce the modified scalar effective action @xmath14 , which is a function of @xmath15 only , defined by @xmath16 and concentrate on studying the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath14 .",

    "the leading behavior of the small mass limit in ( [ masslimit ] ) was first computed by t hooft @xcite , and the next corrections were computed in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this expansion reads @xcite @xmath27 and using this series with ( [ ptaction ] ) immediately leads to the large @xmath0 expansion for @xmath19 in ( [ masslimit ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ masslimit ] ) summarizes what is known analytically about the mass dependence of the renormalized one - loop effective action in an instanton background .",

    "we present a technique which computes @xmath19 numerically for _ any _ value of the mass @xmath0 .",
    "our results interpolate smoothly between the analytic small and large mass limits depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "our computational approach makes use of the fact that the single instanton background ( [ instanton ] ) has radial symmetry @xcite . this has the important consequence that the computation of the regularized one - loop effective action ( [ ptaction ] ) can be reduced to a sum over partial waves of logarithms of determinants of radial ordinary differential operators .",
    "each such radial determinant can be computed by a simple numerical method , described in section [ numerical ] .",

    "[ numerical ] we present a simple and efficient numerical technique for computing each of the radial determinants appearing in ( [ pv ] ) . but to extract the renormalized effective action we need to be able to consider the @xmath48 limit in conjunction with the infinite sum over @xmath46 .",

    "this divergence is canceled by a divergence of the second sum in ( [ actionsplit ] ) in the large @xmath50 limit , as we show in the next section .",
    "in the second sum in ( [ actionsplit ] ) we can not take the large @xmath50 and large @xmath9 limits blindly , as each leads to a divergence .",
    "however , we show in this section that the @xmath9 divergence is precisely of the counterterm form in the renormalized action in ( [ renaction ] ) , and that the large @xmath50 divergence is such that it precisely cancels the large @xmath50 divergences from the large @xmath50 limit of the sum in ( [ lj ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain a finite renormalized effective action .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that the large @xmath9 and large @xmath50 divergences of the second sum in ( [ actionsplit ] ) can be computed _ analytically _ , using the wkb approximation for the corresponding determinants .",

    "in fact , the usual leading - order wkb theory is not sufficient for the determinant calculation if a consistent renormalization demands the contribution from higher - order wkb approximation to be included .",
    "we shall see below that this is the case .",
    "the renormalization problem mentioned above has been solved in our earlier paper @xcite , by including needed higher - order wkb contributions within the schwinger proper - time representation @xcite for the effective action .",

    "actually , in the instanton background we are considering , the nature of the scattering problem as defined by ( [ appradial ] ) and ( [ appradialfree ] ) does not allow us to consider the @xmath46-sum and @xmath47-sum in ( [ appfinalf ] ) in a completely independent manner .",

    "but , in the massive case , the exact phase shifts can not be obtained analytically . therefore ,",
    "in @xcite , we proposed to use the wkb expressions for the phase shifts , together with our formula ( [ appjsummedf ] ) .",
    "this method is elaborated below .",
    "first , we need the results of dunham @xcite for higher - order wkb approximations to the scattering phase shifts .",
    "if the schrdinger equation is written in the form @xmath200 the phase shift in the leading wkb approximation is given by @xmath201,\\ ] ] where the integration path goes around the turning point @xmath202 ( i.e. , the point where @xmath203 vanishes ) in the complex plane , and crosses the real axis at @xmath204 ( with @xmath205 ) and @xmath206 ( with @xmath207 taken to positive infinity ) .",

    "the latter should be transformed appropriately , following langer @xcite .",
    "thus , writing @xmath210 and introducing the function @xmath211 we recast ( [ appradial ] ) as @xmath212 since this is of the form ( [ appdunhameq ] ) , we can get the relevant scattering phase shifts simply by setting @xmath213 and also , in connection with the free equation ( [ appradialfree ] ) , @xmath214 then , using the original variable @xmath210 and integrating by parts , the desired wkb expressions for the phase shifts assume the form @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the so - called langer modification @xcite of the potential @xmath217 and the term referred to ( ` free ' ) denotes the integral expression appearing before but with @xmath216 replaced by @xmath218 note that @xmath219 , and @xmath220 . using the results ( [ appreta1])-([appreta3 ] ) in ( [ appjsummedf ] )",
    ", we can simplify the expression by carrying out the @xmath221-integration .",
    "first , consider the leading order wkb . the first contour integral in ( [ appreta1 ] ) can be changed to the integral along the real axis over the interval @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is a turning point , i.e. , @xmath224 = 0 $ ] . on the other hand , @xmath221-integral in ( [ appjsummedf ] )",
    "runs from 0 to @xmath225 .",
    "we may here change the order of integration , that is , perform the @xmath221-integral prior to considering the @xmath71-integration : in this case , the integration range for @xmath221 would be over the interval @xmath226 , where @xmath227 represents the value specified by the condition @xmath228 = 0 $ ] for a given value of @xmath71 .",
    "similar consideration may be given to the second contour integral in ( [ appreta2 ] ) , the ` free ' part .",
    "then , observing that we obtain from the first contour integral @xmath229 ( and similarly the form @xmath230 from the second contour integral ) , we are led to the following leading - order wkb expression for @xmath26 : @xmath231 , \\label{appsmallf } \\\\ & & f^{(1)}_{(l , j)}(s , r ) = \\frac{e^{-s \\tilde{v}_{(l , j)}(r)}}{2 \\sqrt{\\pi } \\sqrt{s } } - \\frac{e^{-s \\tilde{v}_l ( r)}}{2 \\sqrt{\\pi } % leeedit - \\tilde{v}^0_l - > \\tilde{v}_l \\sqrt{s}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use similar procedures to simplify the contributions coming from the second- and third- order wkb phase shifts in ( [ appreta2 ] ) and ( [ appreta3 ] ) .",
    "for this , a particularly useful relation is @xmath232^{n+\\frac{1}{2 } } } = \\frac{e^{-s \\tilde{v}(r ) } s^{n+\\frac{1}{2 } } \\gamma(-n + \\frac{1}{2})}{\\pi } , \\ ( n=0,1,2,\\cdots).\\ ] ] as a result , we obtain the higher order wkb expressions for @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath233 and @xmath234 , which may be expressed again by the form ( [ appsmallf ] ) but with @xmath235 in connection with using the formula ( [ appsmallf ] ) , our discussion will not be complete without being clear about the _ order _ between executing the infinite series sum over @xmath46 and performing the ( improper ) radial integral .",
    "this is a subtle point , and one possible way to settle the issue unambiguously would be to check explicitly which order gives rise to the known small-@xmath25 behavior for the function @xmath26 correctly . as was asserted in @xcite ,",
    "doing the @xmath46-sum before the @xmath71-integration yields the correct result .",
    "if instead one performs the @xmath71-integration first and then considers the @xmath46-sum , it gives a result differing from the correct small @xmath25 expression of @xmath26 by @xmath236 .",
    "[ note that , although we used the wkb series for the calculation , the thus - found difference is an exact result since the order - dependent ambiguity is purely a high - energy phenomenon and the wkb series can be trusted in the high energy limit ] . in view of this remark",
    ", the correct formula to be used in the wkb analysis of the effective action should read @xmath237.\\ ] ] the result of using this formula for the fermion determinant in a single instanton background is presented in @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we address the question of the gauge invariance of the determinant or the effective action .",
    "the proper time representation of the effective action in ( [ ptaction ] ) is written in terms of covariant derivatives and is clearly gauge invariant . however , to formulate the partial wave expansion , as discussed in section [ radial ] , we chose a particular gauge ( [ instanton ] ) .",
    "thus the partial wave expansion used in the main text does not possess manifest gauge invariance . in this appendix",
    "we verify gauge independence by showing that we obtain precisely the same result in a different gauge .",
    "since our computational method relies on the radial symmetry of the background field , we are restricted in which gauge we can choose .",
    "the choice in ( [ instanton ] ) is often called the `` regular '' gauge .",
    "but an instanton background also has radial symmetry in the so - called `` singular '' gauge : @xmath238 in the singular gauge . in ( [ singular ] )",
    ", @xmath239 differs from @xmath11 in ( [ instanton ] ) only by the sign in the components with @xmath5 or @xmath240 equal to 4 @xcite .",
    "the gauge field in the singular gauge has singular behavior in the vicinity of @xmath107 .",
    "one may worry about the validity of the radial approach in the main text in the singular gauge because of this .",
    "however , it turns out that it is not so singular .",
    "physically , the reason for this is the conformal invariance of the instanton background @xcite .",
    "the differential operator @xmath29 in the instanton background ( [ singular ] ) in the singular gauge can be written as , setting @xmath17 , @xmath241\\ , , \\label{singh}\\ ] ] in the region of @xmath242 , the `` potential '' term in ( [ singh ] ) has @xmath243 singular behavior .",
    "but the last two singular terms proportional to @xmath244 combine into @xmath245 , which is regular .",
    "we decompose @xmath246 into @xmath247 ; i.e. , into singular and regular parts . the singular part , @xmath248 combines with the orbital part @xmath249",
    ". we can cast ( [ singh ] ) in the form @xmath250\\ , .",
    "\\label{singh2}\\ ] ] this should be compared with the corresponding operator in the regular gauge [ see ( [ insth ] ) ] : @xmath251\\ , .",
    "\\label{regular}\\ ] ] note that these two have the same form except that @xmath252 and @xmath141 are interchanged . therefore . in the partial wave analysis the radial hamiltonian ( for isospin @xmath1",
    ") can be written as @xmath253\\ , .",
    "\\label{radhsing}\\ ] ] there is a one - to - one correspondence between the eigenvalues for the sector @xmath254 in the singular gauge and those for the sector @xmath255 in the regular gauge , and they have the same multiplicities , @xmath256 .",
    "the regularized one - loop effective action in the singular gauge can be written as @xmath257 here we have combined the radial determinants for @xmath43 and @xmath258 , as in section [ radial ] , and we have arranged the free determinants appropriately . but from the above arguments , we know that @xmath259 hence the singular gauge expression in ( [ pvsingular ] ) is identical with the regular gauge expression in ( [ pv ] ) .",
    "so the pauli - villars regularized one loop effective action has the same value in the singular gauge and in the regular gauge , and therefore the renormalized effective action ( [ renaction ] ) , and the modified effective action ( [ modaction ] ) , has the same value in each gauge .",

    "<S> the precise quark mass dependence of the one - loop effective action in an instanton background has recently been computed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result interpolates smoothly between the previously known extreme small and large mass limits . </S>",
    "<S> the computational method makes use of the fact that the single instanton background has radial symmetry , so that the computation can be reduced to a sum over partial waves of logarithms of radial determinants , each of which can be computed numerically in an efficient manner . </S>",
    "<S> the bare sum over partial waves is divergent and must be regulated and renormalized . in this paper we provide more details of this computation , including both the renormalization procedure and the numerical approach . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with comparisons of our precise numerical results with a simple interpolating function that connects the small and large mass limits , and with the leading order of the derivative expansion .    </S>",
