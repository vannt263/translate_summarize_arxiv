    "we will be concerned with the study of the structure of orbits of vectors @xmath4 under the action of @xmath3 from various points of view .",
    "if @xmath5 is any vector of @xmath2 , the _ orbit _ of @xmath5 under @xmath3 is the set @xmath6 .",
    "the closure of this orbit is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the _ linear orbit _ of @xmath5 is the linear span of the orbit of @xmath2 , i.e. the set @xmath8\\}$ ] , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "when the linear orbit of @xmath5 is dense , @xmath5 is said to be _ cyclic _ , and @xmath5 is said to be _ hypercyclic _  when the orbit itself is dense . an operator  admitting a cyclic ( resp .",
    "hypercyclic )  vector is called cyclic ( resp hypercyclic ) .",
    "the structure of the set @xmath11 of hypercyclic  vectors for a hypercyclic  operator  @xmath12 has been the subject of many investigations : linear structure ( @xmath11 always contains a dense linear manifold , see @xcite , sometimes an infinite - dimensional closed subspace , see @xcite ) , topological structure ( @xmath11 is a dense @xmath13 subset of @xmath2 ) , measure - theoretic structure ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) ... in particular , it is interesting to look for operators  whose set of hypercyclic  ( or even cyclic ) vectors is as large as possible , especially in the hilbert space setting . throughout the paper @xmath14",
    "will denote a real or complex separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "a major open question in operator  theory is to know whether , given any bounded operator  @xmath3 on @xmath14 , there exists a closed subspace @xmath15 ( resp . a closed subset @xmath16 ) which is non - trivial , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and invariant by @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath19 ( resp , with @xmath16 ) .",
    "these problems are known as the invariant subspace and the invariant subset problems .",
    "if one does not work with operators  acting on a hilbert space , but with operators  acting on general ,  banach spaces instead , the question has been answered in the negative by enflo @xcite and read @xcite . read",
    "in particular constructed an operator  without non - trivial invariant subspaces in the space @xmath0 of summable sequences , and even an operatorwithout non - trivial invariant closed subsets on @xmath0 @xcite . in other words",
    "@xmath20 for this operator .",
    "the invariant subspace problem is still open in the reflexive setting , and the closest one could get @xcite to this are examples of operators without non - trivial invariant subspaces on some spaces with separable dual , such as @xmath1 for instance .",
    "our aim in this paper is to present a simplified version of read s construction in @xcite which is adapted to the hilbert space setting , and to obtain in this way operators  whose orbits have interesting properties : we first construct an example of a hilbert space operator   such that the orbit of every vector @xmath5 coincides with its linear orbit .",
    "this corresponds to the construction of what we call the `` ( c)-part '' in read s type operators  ( see section @xmath21 for definitions ) .",
    "[ th1 ] there exists a hypercyclic operator  on @xmath14 such that for every vector @xmath22 , the closure of the orbit @xmath23 is a subspace , i.e. the closures of the two sets @xmath24 and @xmath25\\}$ ] coincide .",
    "we define in section @xmath21 the operators  which will be needed for the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , explain the role of the ( c)-fan , and then prove theorem [ th1 ] in section @xmath26 .",
    "this can be seen as the basic construction , and in section @xmath27 we elaborate on it to prove the next results .",
    "section @xmath27 is devoted to the study of the set @xmath11 from the point of view of geometric measure theory : it is well known and easy to prove that whenever @xmath3 is hypercyclic on @xmath2 , @xmath11 is a dense @xmath13 subset of @xmath2 , or equivalently , its complement @xmath28 is a set of the first category , i.e. a countable union of closed sets with empty interior , so @xmath28 is a `` small '' set from this point of view . increasing the size of @xmath11 means having @xmath28 smaller , and various notions of smallness",
    "have been considered in this setting . in particular , bayart studied in @xcite examples of operators  such that @xmath28 was @xmath29-porous , i.e. a countable union of porous sets .",
    "the notion of porosity quantifies the fact that a set has empty interior : a subset @xmath30 of a banach space @xmath2 is called _ porous _ if there exists a @xmath310,1[$ ] such that the following is true : for every @xmath32 and every @xmath33 , there exists a point @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 is empty .",
    "a countable union of porous sets is called _ @xmath37-porous_.",
    "we refer the reader to the references @xcite or @xcite for more information on porous and @xmath37-porous sets , and their role in questions related to the differentiation of banach - valued functions .",
    "bayart constructed in @xcite examples of operators  @xmath3 on @xmath16-spaces such that @xmath28 was @xmath37-porous , but on banach spaces the only operators   which were known to have this property were the ones without nontrivial closed invariant subsets . hence a question of @xcite was to know whether it was possible to have a hilbert space operator  @xmath3 such that @xmath28 was @xmath37-porous .",
    "this question was answered in the affirmative by david preiss @xcite , who constructed a bilateral weighted shift on @xmath38 having this property .",
    "this proof has been since recorded in @xcite .",
    "this leads to another question , which was asked by david preiss too @xcite : does there exist a hilbert space operator  such that @xmath28 is haar null ? recall that a subset @xmath39 of @xmath14 is said to be _ haar null _ if there exists a borel probability  measure  @xmath40 on @xmath14 such that for every @xmath22 , the translate @xmath41 of @xmath39 has @xmath40-measure  @xmath42 .",
    "the class of haar null sets is another @xmath37-ideal of `` small sets '' , different from the class of @xmath37-porous sets , and actually these two classes are not comparable : a result of preiss and tiser @xcite is that any ( real ) banach space can be decomposed as the disjoint union of two sets , of which one is @xmath37-porous and the other haar null .",
    "see @xcite for more on this and related classes of negligible sets .",
    "we answer here preiss s question in the affirmative by showing the following stronger result :    [ th2 ] there exists a bounded operator  @xmath3 on the hilbert space @xmath14 such that the set @xmath28 is a countable union of subsets of closed hyperplanes of @xmath14 . in particular",
    "@xmath28 is gauss null ( hence haar null ) and @xmath29-porous .",
    "recall that a subset @xmath39 of @xmath14 is said to be _ gauss null _ if for every non - degenerate  gaussian  measure  @xmath43 on @xmath14 , @xmath44 .",
    "since the @xmath43-measureof a closed hyperplane vanishes for every such @xmath43 , @xmath28 will clearly be gauss null .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th2 ] requires that we complicate a bit the construction of section @xmath21 , and we introduce what we call the `` ( b)-part '' in read s examples in order to achieve this . for clarity",
    "s sake we show first in section @xmath27 that an operator  @xmath3 can be constructed with @xmath28 haar null ( and @xmath37-porous ) .",
    "then we show in section @xmath45 the following result , which is interesting in itself and which easily implies theorem [ th2 ] :    [ th2bis ] there exists a bounded operator  @xmath3 on @xmath14 which is _ orbit - unicellular _ : the family @xmath46 of all the closures of its orbits is totally ordered , i.e. for any pair @xmath47 of vectors of @xmath14 , either @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "in particular the operator  induced by @xmath3 on any invariant subspace @xmath15 of @xmath14 is hypercyclic , i.e. @xmath50 for some @xmath22 .",
    "the term `` orbit - unicellularity '' comes from the fact that an operator  is said to be _ unicellular _ if the lattice of its invariant subspaces is totally ordered .",
    "when an operator @xmath3 is unicellular , every invariant subspace @xmath15 of @xmath3 is cyclic , i.e. is the closure @xmath51 of the linear orbit of some vector @xmath22 , and the unicellularity of @xmath3 is equivalent to the fact that for every pair @xmath47 of vectors of @xmath14 , either @xmath52 or @xmath53 . see for instance @xcite for some examples of unicellular operators . in our case @xmath54 , so @xmath3 is in particular unicellular .",
    "let us underline here that the point of theorem [ th2bis ] is that we are dealing with hypercyclic  vectors , and not with cyclic ones : of course there are many operators  whose lattice of invariant subspaces it totally ordered .",
    "this is the case for the volterra operator  @xmath55 on @xmath56)$ ] for instance : each invariant subspace for @xmath55 is of the form @xmath57 ) \\textrm { ; } f=0 \\textrm { a.e . on }",
    "( 0,t ) \\}$ ] , @xmath58 $ ] . in this case",
    "the lattice of invariant subspaces is isomorphic to @xmath59 with its natural order .",
    "it is even possible that the lattice of invariant subspaces be countable : this is the case for instance for some weighted unilateral backward shifts on @xmath60 , the donoghue operators . here",
    "the non trivial invariant subspaces are exactly the finite dimensional spaces @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the canonical basis of @xmath60 .",
    "it is worth noting that such a situation can not occur for an operator  whose closure of orbits are subspaces and which is orbit - unicellular .",
    "indeed suppose that @xmath15 and @xmath64 are two invariant subspaces for @xmath3 with @xmath65 . as was mentioned in theorem [ th2bis ] ,",
    "there exist two vectors @xmath5 and @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to see that the operatorinduced by @xmath3 on the quotient @xmath69 is hypercyclic , which implies that @xmath69 is infinite - dimensional .",
    "hence the `` gap '' between two invariant subspaces of @xmath3 , if non trivial , is of infinite dimension .",
    "this leads to the following observation :    [ prop2ter ] the following dichotomy holds true :    1 .",
    "either there exists a bounded operator   @xmath3 on an infinite - dimensional separable hilbert space which has no non trivial invariant closed subset ; 2 .   or every operator  acting on an infinite - dimensional separable hilbert space , whose closure of orbits are subspaces and which is orbit - unicellular , has the following property : there exists a family of ( closures of ) orbits which is order isomorphic to @xmath70 .",
    "in particular such an operator  has uncountably many distinct ( closures of ) orbits .    in section @xmath71 we give a positive answer to a question of @xcite which concerns orbit - reflexive operators  on hilbert spaces .",
    "if @xmath12 is a bounded operator  on @xmath2 , @xmath3 is said to be _ orbit - reflexive _",
    "if whenever @xmath72 is such that @xmath73 belongs to the closure of @xmath23 for every @xmath4 , then @xmath39 must belong to the closure of the set @xmath74 for the strong operator topology ( sot ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath39 and @xmath3 must commute . various conditions are given in @xcite under which an operator  on a hilbert space is orbit - reflexive : for instance any contraction on a hilbert space is orbit - reflexive . the following question is asked in @xcite : does there exist an operator  on a hilbert space which is not orbit - reflexive ?",
    "this question was pointed out to us by vladimir mller @xcite .",
    "we answer it here in the affirmative :    [ th3 ] there exists a bounded operator  on a hilbert space which is not orbit - reflexive .",
    "theorem [ th3 ] follows from a slight modification of the construction of section @xmath27 .",
    "after this paper was submitted for publication , we were informed by vladimir mller that a much more simple example of a non orbit - reflexive hilbert space operator  was constructed independently in @xcite , as well as an example of an operator  on the space @xmath75 which is reflexive but not orbit - reflexive .",
    "we finish this introduction with a comment : we have mentioned previously that the proofs of theorems [ th1 ] , [ th2 ] and [ th3 ] involve operators  of read s type , and we use the ( c)-part and the ( b)-part of it",
    ". the reader may justly ask about a possible ( a)-part : such an ( a)-part indeed appears in read s constructions in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , and it is actually the part which provides the vectors which belong to the closures of all the sets @xmath7 .",
    "we start from the hilbert space @xmath60 of square - summable sequences indexed by the set @xmath76 of nonnegative integers , with its canonical basis @xmath77 .",
    "a vector @xmath5 of @xmath60 is as usual said to be _ finitely supported _ if all but finitely many of its coordinates on the basis @xmath77 vanish , and the set of finitely supported vectors will be denoted by @xmath78 .",
    "the forward shift @xmath3 on @xmath60 is the operator  defined by @xmath79 for every @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 is a sequence of finitely supported vectors such that @xmath82 and @xmath83=\\textrm{sp}[e_{0},\\ldots , e_{j}]$ ] for every @xmath84 ( @xmath85 belongs to @xmath86 $ ] and the @xmath87 coordinate of @xmath85 on the basis @xmath77 is non - zero ) , then one can define on @xmath78 a new norm associated to the sequence @xmath88 . for any finite subset @xmath89 of @xmath76 and any collection @xmath90 of scalars ,",
    "@xmath91 the completion of @xmath78 under this new norm is a hilbert space , with the sequence @xmath81 as an orthonormal basis .",
    "we are going to show that for a suitable choice of the sequence @xmath81 , the operator  @xmath3 acting on @xmath78 extends to a bounded operator  on the hilbert space @xmath92 which satisfies the properties of theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath93 $ ] the space of polynomials with coefficients in @xmath9 or @xmath10 , and by @xmath94 $ ] the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath95 . for @xmath96 $ ] , @xmath97 , we write as usual @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 be an increasing sequence of positive integers , and for every @xmath100 let @xmath101 be a finite family of polynomials of degree at most @xmath102 with @xmath103 for every @xmath104 . in the proofs of the theorems , the polynomials @xmath105 will have to satisfy some additional properties , the most usual one being that the family @xmath101 forms an @xmath106-net of the ball of radius @xmath21 of @xmath107 $ ] , but since these families will be chosen differently in the proofs of the four theorems , we present for the time being the general construction .",
    "the construction of the vectors @xmath85 , @xmath80 , is to be done by induction , starting from @xmath82 . at step @xmath108 , vectors @xmath85",
    "will be constructed for @xmath109 $ ] , where @xmath110 is a sequence with @xmath111 which will be chosen to grow very fast .",
    "we emphasize that all the constants we are going to construct at step @xmath108 are determined by the various constants which are constructed through steps @xmath42 to @xmath112 .",
    "when we say that a certain constant @xmath113 depends only on @xmath114 , it means that it depends only on the construction from steps @xmath42 to @xmath112 .",
    "the construction is done by induction on @xmath108 , and in all our statements we assume that the construction has been carried out until step @xmath112",
    ".    there will be two different types of definitions of @xmath85 for @xmath115 $ ] , depending on whether @xmath116 belongs or not to a collection of intervals called the _ fan _ ( we will later on call it the _ ( c)-fan _ , to distinguish it from another fan which is going to be introduced afterwards ) : this fan is a lattice of intervals which we call _ working intervals _ , and their role is to ensure that every orbit is a linear manifold . the intervals between working intervals we call _ lay - off intervals _ : on a lay - off interval , @xmath85 is defined as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is a scalar coefficient which is very large if @xmath116 belongs to the beginning of the lay - off interval , and very small if @xmath116 belongs to its end , while the quotient @xmath119 is very close to @xmath120 .",
    "thus when both @xmath116 and @xmath121 belong to a lay - off interval , @xmath122 and @xmath3 acts as a weighted shift .",
    "so in a sense , `` nothing much happens on the lay - off intervals '' , which explains their name .",
    "their role is to prevent `` side effects '' from the working intervals , which do the real work .    here",
    "are now the precise definition of the vectors @xmath85 , @xmath123 . for any finite sub - interval @xmath39 of @xmath76 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath124 the projection of @xmath78 onto the span of the vectors @xmath85 , @xmath125 .",
    "since we will always require that @xmath83=\\textrm{sp}[e_{0},\\ldots , e_{j}]$ ] , @xmath5 belongs to @xmath78 if and only ifit is finitely supported in @xmath14 with respect to  @xmath81 .",
    "when we talk of support in the sequel , we will always mean with respect to  @xmath81 : @xmath5 is supported in @xmath39 if @xmath126 .",
    "the norm @xmath127 is the norm of @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath128 be an extremely fast increasing sequence of integers with @xmath129 very large with respect to  @xmath130 .",
    "the fan consists of the lattice of all the intervals @xmath131,\\ ] ] where @xmath132 are nonnegative integers belonging to @xmath133 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath134 is a very large integer depending only on @xmath114 , but not on the @xmath135 s , which will be chosen later on in the proof",
    ". if the gaps between the different @xmath135 s are large enough , all these @xmath136 intervals are disjoint . for @xmath137 $ ]",
    ", we call @xmath138 the @xmath139 coordinate of the interval @xmath140 , and write @xmath141 .    let @xmath142 $ ] be the largest integer such that @xmath143 .",
    "we will write @xmath144 when there is no risk of confusion . for @xmath145 , we define @xmath85 to be @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a very small positive number depending only on @xmath114 which will be chosen in the sequel .",
    "the interest of this definition is twofold : first of all , we can already justify the name of working interval , simply by using the definition of @xmath85 for @xmath148 with @xmath149 :    [ fact4 ] let @xmath150 be a small positive number .",
    "if @xmath147 is small enough , then for every @xmath5 supported in @xmath151 $ ] and every @xmath152 , @xmath153    since @xmath154= \\textrm{sp}[f_{0},\\ldots , f_{\\xi _",
    "{ n}}]$ ] , we can write any vector @xmath5 with support in @xmath151 $ ] as @xmath155 .",
    "then @xmath156 .",
    "now @xmath157 belongs to the working interval @xmath158 $ ] , so @xmath159 .",

    "thus @xmath166 if @xmath147 is small enough",
    ".    hence if the collection @xmath167 is `` sufficiently dense '' among polynomials with @xmath168 , fact [ fact4 ] gives that the orbit of the vector @xmath169 ( and hence of any finitely supported vector @xmath5 ) contains in its closure any vector @xmath170 with @xmath168 . in order to obtain this result for every vector ,",
    "not only finitely supported ones , one clearly needs to control the behaviour of the quantities @xmath171}x)||$ ] ( and then to dispense with the condition @xmath168 , but this is not difficult ) . more precisely , we will need the following proposition , which we shall prove in section @xmath26 :    [ prop2][prop5 ] for every @xmath100 , every @xmath172 and every @xmath22 such that @xmath173}x=0 $ ] , @xmath174 .",

    "only the intervals @xmath176 are needed for the proof of fact [ fact4 ] , but for the estimates of proposition [ prop5 ] one needs the whole lattice , and this is why all the other intervals , which could be called `` shades '' of the basic intervals @xmath176 , appear in the definition of the fan .",
    "we finish this section by showing how @xmath177 can be computed for @xmath116 in a working interval by going down the lattice along each successive coordinate :    [ lem7 ] for every @xmath178 $ ] and every @xmath179-tuple @xmath180 of integers in @xmath133 $ ] , @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the largest index such that @xmath143 .",
    "we have @xmath183 then we go down in the same way along the @xmath184-coordinate , etc ... until there are no more coordinates left",
    ".    we will always choose the maximal degree @xmath102 of the polynomials @xmath105 to be small with respect to  @xmath129 : for the proof of theorem [ th1 ] we will choose simply @xmath185 .",
    "the lay - off intervals are the intervals which lie between the working intervals .",

    "this implies in particular that when @xmath116 is in the beginning of a lay - off interval , @xmath192 is very small , approximately less than @xmath193 .",
    "moreover if @xmath188 is large , the ratio @xmath194 for @xmath116 and @xmath121 is the lay - off interval  becomes very close to @xmath120 .",
    "remark that this ratio does not depend on @xmath116 .",
    "hence the picture at step @xmath108 is the following : there is first one very large lay - off interval , between @xmath195 and @xmath196 , then an alternance of working and lay - off intervals , and at the end a very large lay - off interval  between @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
