    "compaction can be roughly defined as the density relaxation of a loosely packed system of many grains under mechanical tapping or vibration @xcite .",
    "both the time relaxation of the system and the steady state eventually reached in the long time limit , exhibit interesting properties , and have received a lot of attention during the last years .",
    "the description of this phenomenon goes well beyond the scope of equilibrium statistical physics and even of usual non - equilibrium theories .",
    "the time evolution of the system corresponds to a consecutive series of mechanically stable states in which all the particles are at rest , at least at a macroscopic level of description .",
    "therefore , the system is not thermal , in the sense that the fluctuations of the particles around their average positions play no role in characterizing the state of the system .",
    "in fact , in the description of the phenomenology of compaction , time is usually measured in number of taps that , of course , has nothing to do with the real motion of the particles .",
    "edwards and collaborators @xcite formulated some years ago a theory providing a thermodynamic - like description of granular systems under certain circumstances .",
    "the main hypothesis of the theory is that for externally perturbed powders in a steady state , all the mechanically stable ( metastable ) configurations of a granular assembly occupying the same volume have the same probability .",
    "therefore , it is assumed that the volume plays here a role analogous to that of the energy in usual thermal systems .",
    "the parameter conjugated to the volume , similar to the thermal temperature , was named ` compactivity ' .    in principle",
    ", the conditions under which the theory should apply are fulfilled in the compaction process .",
    "for this reason , the predictions of the edwards theory have been compared with results obtained in experiments @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite , and simple models @xcite of compaction .",
    "although in general a fairly good agreement is claimed , at least in the limit of weak tapping , an analysis of the situation shows that there are many fundamental aspects that can not be considered as reasonably well established .",
    "a few of them will be addressed , although not solved with generality , here :    1 .",
    "given that many of the experimental determinations of the compactivity are based in the measurements of density fluctuations , special care must be given to differentiate between fluctuations in the number of particles in a system of constant volume , fluctuations of volume in a system with a given number of particles , and fluctuations of density in a system whose volume and number of particle change in time .",
    "all these fluctuations are not equivalent , in principle @xcite .",
    "some authors have reformulated the thermodynamic theory of powders using the ( configurational ) energy as the variable characterizing the macroscopic state of the system and an _ effective _ temperature , i.e. they use a formulation much closer to ordinary statistical physics .",
    "the equivalence or relationship between both formulations does not seem to be clear , although some ideas have been presented @xcite .",
    "for instance , are the compactivity and the effective temperature independent variables or there is a relationship between them ?",
    "the thermodynamic theory of powders was formulated for complete systems , and not as a local theory . in this context",
    ", it could be thought that a column of tapped granular matter in the steady state is characterized by a unique compactivity , aside from the boundary layers , even though the system is inhomogeneous .",
    "another possibility is to consider that the system can be divided into horizontal layers , each of them having a different compactivity ( or effective temperature ) .",
    "in fact , this local version of the theory has been often used in describing experiments and particle simulations . which are the physical meaning and the implications of a gradient of the compactivity , or effective temperature , are also open questions .",
    "another important aspect of compaction refers to the response to an external perturbation , e.g. a change of the vibration intensity .",
    "it happens that many of the peculiar dynamic behaviors exhibited by granular materials under tapping are similar to those shown by conventional structural glasses .",
    "for instance , both kind of systems present slow relaxation , annealing properties , and hysteresis effects . a necessary first step in order to understand these issues",
    "is to study the response of the system to a small perturbation of the conditions defining its steady state ( linear response ) .",
    "of course , the obvious external parameter to vary in the compaction experiment is the vibration intensity characterizing the tapping process , and the quantity whose response to analyze is the volume of the system . in the process",
    ", all the system , with a constant number of particles , is considered .    an additional reason to study linear response in granular systems ,",
    "is that fluctuation - dissipation relations obtained in molecular systems in the context of linear response theory , are being used to test the thermodynamic theory of granular matter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , given the non thermal character of granular systems , even if the validity of the thermodynamic theory as proposed by edwards is assumed , there is no reason _ a priori _ to expect the fluctuation - dissipation relations to apply .",
    "the aim here is to investigate the above mentioned issues by means of a very simple model for compaction @xcite .",
    "the model dynamics is defined in such a way that it conserves the number of particles in the system , i.e. it is a closed system .",
    "its volume changes due to the creation and destruction of empty sites or holes in the lattice over which the system is defined .",
    "the model is consistent with the edwards thermodynamic theory , although of course it is far away of any physically feasible system . nevertheless , it is interesting to qualitatively compare its predictions with the experimental results and with the behavior obtained by means of numerical simulation ( monte carlo and molecular dynamics ) of much more sophisticated and realistic models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the model to be used in the following",
    "is formulated as a markov process , and some of its properties derived in ref .",
    "@xcite are shortly summarized .",
    "in particular , the steady distribution characterizing the long time limit of compaction is reminded and the edwards compactivity identified . from the steady distribution ,",
    "explicit expressions for some average properties are easily derived .",
    "special attention is given to the relationship between the second moment of the volume fluctuations and the average volume , since it has been used to compute the compactivity in experiments .",
    "the detailed shape of the volume fluctuations is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , where it is predicted to be gaussian in the limit of a large system , i.e. with a large enough number of particles .",

    "[ s4 ] . special emphasis is put on the discussion of the boundary conditions , e.g. open versus closed systems ,",
    "the local or global character of the measurements , and the concept of effective temperature and its relationship with the compactivity . in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] , the linear response of the model to a change in the tapping intensity is investigated .",
    "the volume response function is computed by monte carlo simulation , and a stretched exponential decay is found in the relevant part of the relaxation . finally , in the last section , a short summary and some additional discussions are presented .",
    "consider a one - dimensional lattice having @xmath0 particles and a variable number of sites .",
    "the dynamics of the system is modeled trying to capture , in a very simplified way , the relevant features of compaction processes in tapped granular systems @xcite .",
    "then , a markov process is introduced with the elementary transitions given in table [ table1 ] , where the circles represent particles and the crosses empty sites or holes , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary positive real parameters @xcite .",
    "time is measured in some arbitrary units proportional to the number of taps . only those particles involved and/or conditioning each of the transitions are represented .",
    "it is worth to point out that the equality of the rates for diffusion and hole annihilation follows from the rational of the model @xcite .",
    ".[table1 ] elementary transitions and their transition rates for the lattice model . particles and holes",
    "are represented by circles and crosses , respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the transitions in table [ table1 ] define the modeled effective dynamics connecting metastable configurations in a system being tapped .",
    "these configurations are characterized by the property that all the holes are isolated , i.e. surrounded by two particles and , in order to enumerate them , a set of variables @xmath3 is introduced . by definition",
    ", the variable @xmath4 takes the value @xmath5 if there is a hole to its right , separating it from particle @xmath6 . on the other hand , @xmath7 if the site to the right of particle @xmath8 is occupied by particle @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that there can not be a hole either to the left of particle @xmath9 or to the right of particle @xmath0 .",
    "note that this feature is preserved by the dynamical events allowed in the model .",
    "moreover , the dynamics does not change the relative order of the particles in the lattice and , therefore , the identity of the particles plays no role in describing the configurations of the system .",
    "more details , as well as a discussion of the physical motivation of the model , are given in ref .",

    "finally , @xmath22 is the ` partition function ' following from the normalization condition , @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the number of metastable configurations having exactly @xmath25 holes . a standard combinatorial reasoning yields @xmath26    from eqs .",

    "( [ 2.10 ] ) applies .",
    "once @xmath34 is known in a analytical form , it is a simple task to compute average values characterizing the macroscopic state of the system . also , the probability distribution for the number of holes in the steady state , @xmath35 , is easily derived , @xmath36 in the second equality above , @xmath37 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the associated moment generating function @xcite is @xmath38 thus the cumulant generating function @xcite of the variable @xmath25 is @xmath39 where use has been made of eq .",

    "( [ 2.15 ] ) , it is seen that the steady state gets more compact as @xmath32 increases . on the other hand",
    ", it is found that the relaxation of the system becomes slower @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the physical interpretation of the model , where @xmath44 is understood to play a role analogous to the tapping intensity in granular experiments @xcite .",
    "now , in order to get a canonical distribution of the form proposed by edwards and coworkers @xcite , the ` compactivity ' @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 so the steady distribution in eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath47 in terms of the compactivity , eqs .",
    "( [ 2.15 ] ) and ( [ 2.16 ] ) take the form @xmath48 respectively .",
    "combination of the above two equations gives @xmath49 showing the typical @xmath50 dependence of the relative fluctuations of an extensive quantity on the number of particles of the system .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 can take arbitrary positive real values , it is clear from the definition of @xmath32 given below eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) , that its range of variation is @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 can take any real value , i.e. @xmath52 . more precisely , when @xmath32 is increased monotonically from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , the compactivity @xmath45 decreases from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( for @xmath57 ) , then jumping to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and decreasing again towards @xmath60 .",
    "then , there is a parameter region , namely @xmath61 , or @xmath62 , in which negative values of the compactivity occur . with reference to the dynamics of the model ,",
    "this happens when the transition rate for the hole creation processes is larger than that for hole annihilation processes .",

    "was first noted by nowak et al .",
    "@xcite , and used in ref .",

    "more will be said about this in sec .",
    "the length @xmath69 of the system , measured in units of the distance between consecutive sites , is @xmath70 in the steady state , the average value of @xmath69 is @xmath71 it is also convenient to introduce the length per particle @xmath72 , so @xmath73 , or @xmath74 this can be transformed into a relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath75 by means of eq .",
    "( [ 2.17 ] ) , @xmath76 it is seen that @xmath77 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath78 , vanishing for @xmath79 that , of course , corresponds to @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that @xmath81 for @xmath82 , while @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "negative compactivities correspond to the loosest configurations and have also been obtained in other models of compaction @xcite .",
    "the inverse of the compactivity does not vanish in the limit of the loosest possible configuration , but it tends to @xmath85 .",
    "obviously , the existence of negative values of the compactivity does not violate any general physical principle and does not imply any instability of the steady state .",
    "they are a consequence of the fact that the number of configurations @xmath24 is not a monotonic increasing function of the length of the system ( or @xmath25 ) , but it exhibits a maximum , going afterwards to unity for the maximum value of the number of holes , @xmath86 .",
    "equivalently , the possibility of steady states with @xmath83 is directly related with the length @xmath69 of the system having a finite upper bound . from a formal point of view , the situation is similar to the existence of negative temperatures in systems of nuclear spins in certain paramagnetic crystals placed in an external magnetic field .    from eq .",
    "( [ 2.16 ] ) , the variance of the total length can be written as @xmath87 in order to get a more detailed information of the length fluctuations , introduce the stochastic variable @xmath88 by @xmath89 the moment generating function of @xmath88 is @xmath90_{q= k/\\sigma_{n_{h}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 was defined in eq .",

    "formally , this is equivalent to saying that the probability density @xmath95 for the variable @xmath96 is also gaussian with average @xmath97 and standard deviation @xmath98 .",
    "a numerical check of the gaussian character of @xmath88 for large values of @xmath28 is presented in fig .",

    "of course , given the simplicity of the model discussed here and its one - dimensional character , it can not be expected to quantitatively reproduce the experimental and simulation results . nevertheless , it is interesting and illuminating to qualitatively analyze those results in the light of the model predictions .",
    "the first experimental investigation of the volume fluctuations in the steady state of a tapped granular medium seems to be the one reported in ref . @xcite .",
    "more exactly , the property considered in that work is the density in a given region , located at a certain height of the system .",
    "then , the volume is kept constant and the measured density changes are due to variations in the number of particles within the volume considered .",
    "the results indicated that the probability distribution of the density fluctuations exhibited in the majority of the cases a gaussian shape , as found in the model , although some significant non - gaussian deviations were also found , particularly near the bottom of the vibrated column .",
    "moreover , the dependence on the number of particles of the relative variance was also the same as in the model , i.e @xmath50 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ 2.19a ] ) .",
    "variations in the inverse of the compactivity were also measured , by using the relationship between the second moment of the volume fluctuations @xmath108 and the compactivity following from edwards theory , i.e. the generalization of eq .",

    "taking into account that the available range of experimental data is rather limited and located in the proximity of the close packing limit , it can be fairly concluded that the above expressions are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the model , namely the expressions for @xmath103 and @xmath114 , eqs .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) respectively . nevertheless , to put this comparison in a fair proper context ,",
    "the following two comments seem appropriated :    1 .   in ref .",
    "@xcite , the edwards theory is considered in a _",
    "local _ form , i.e. it is assumed that the state of each subregion of the system in which measurements are carried out is described by a canonical distribution with a different value of the compactivity . although this might be a sensible idea , it is clearly an extension of the theory as originally formulated by edwards .",
    "moreover , what is measured in the reported experiments are the fluctuations in the number of particles at constant volume .",
    "this is different from the fluctuations in the volume at constant number of particles , although both can be associated to density fluctuations .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the quantity actually obtained from the second moment of the number of particles fluctuations by means of a relationship similar to eq .",
    "( [ 2.21 ] ) is not the compactivity , but some kind of ` fugacity ' @xcite .",
    "although both quantities are simply related and perhaps their values are very close in real granular systems , they are conceptually quite different .",
    "another experimental study of the steady volume fluctuations in a granular medium has been carried out by schrter _",
    ". this work might look as quite similar to the one discussed above , but they differ in important aspects , both in the methodology and in the results . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fluctuations of the _ total _ volume of the system were measured , although the results are expressed in terms of the volume fraction @xmath101 .",
    "a gaussian distribution was found in all the reported cases . also , the ratio between the standard deviation and the average turned out to be proportional to the inverse of the square root of the number of particles .",
    "both results are the same as derived above for the model considered here",
    ". nevertheless , the variance of the volume fraction fluctuations did not show the analogous of the simple linear behavior reported in ref.@xcite that , as it has been already mentioned , is consistent with the linear behavior predicted by eq .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) near the close packing limit . instead",
    ", it presents a well defined minimum . a first",
    ", naive explanation is provided by the fact that a wider density range is analyzed in @xcite than in @xcite .",
    "then , it could be expected that the linear law in the latter corresponds to an approximate description of a small window of the density interval considered in the former , namely to one with the largest volume fraction values . even assuming this explanation , the origin of the minimum would remain as an open question .",
    "the result obtained with the model , eq .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) , when considered over the density range @xmath115 , also shows a non - monotonic behavior , but presenting a maximum instead of a minimum exhibited by the experimental data in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , it seems plausible to conclude that the existence of the minimum , if confirmed , must be due to some effects that are not captured by the simple model considered here . given that it appears for high values of the density , it is tempting to speculate whether the increase of the volume fluctuations in that region , to the right of the minimum , is an indication of the presence of some ` singular ' behavior associated , for instance , with the existence of a maximum random packing , a phenomenon that is not present in the model .",
    "the edwards compactivity @xmath45 was also determined by schrter _",
    "et al . _ by means of the granular version of the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem . to get explicit values for @xmath45",
    ", these authors assume that the inverse of the compactivity vanishes in the random loose packing limit .",
    "since @xmath45 is a monotonic decreasing function of the volume fraction , this boundary condition implies that it is always positive .",
    "as it has already been indicated , there is nothing in the granular statistical mechanics theory requiring this to be true .",
    "if attention is restricted to the parameter region in which the model has positive compactivity , i.e. @xmath116 , the shape of the curve @xmath117 , eq .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) , is similar to the one reported in fig .",
    "4(c ) of ref . @xcite .",
    "although the recent results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite have not been obtained experimentally , but by means of molecular dynamics and monte carlo simulations , they deserve special attention because of their relevance and the interest of the analysis carried out . in particular , interest is focused on a parameter defined as the configurational granular temperature , instead of the compactivity , although some close relationship between both parameters is claimed to hold .",
    "a model system of grains with normal and tangential forces is considered .",
    "the instantaneous volume fraction is measured in the steady state and analyzed as a function of its average value . to measure them",
    ", a region in the bulk of the system is considered .",
    "it is important to stress that this region is defined in such a way that both its volume and its number of particles fluctuate in time .",
    "consistently with all the results discussed above and the model predictions , gaussian fluctuations of the volume fraction are also found in the simulations .",
    "the analysis of the results in @xcite differs , at least conceptually , of the thermodynamic theory as proposed initially by edwards @xcite . instead of considering that",
    "the macroscopic parameter characterizing the state of the system is the volume , the energy is used like in normal molecular systems .",
    "more precisely , the probability @xmath118 of finding the system in the blocked metastable state @xmath119 of energy @xmath120 is assumed to be given by @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is referred to as the configurational granular temperature of the system .",

    "a linear behavior of @xmath127 is clearly identified .",

    "( [ 4.6 ] ) is verified .",
    "when this is done , a systematic but quite small deviation from linearity is observed .",

    "[ fig3 ] ]    the kind of behavior of the response function has been often found in the context of structural glasses , both in experiments and in simple models , for the linear relaxation of the energy following a temperature perturbation @xcite .",
    "then , this is another indication of a possible conceptual connection between structural glasses and dense granular systems .",
    "moreover , the simulation results for the model clearly indicate that the value of the exponent @xmath170 characterizing most of the relaxation tends to @xmath186 as the value of @xmath32 increases . in simple models of structural glasses",
    ", this value is associated to diffusive processes @xcite .",
    "although an explicit analytical solution of the model has not been derived yet , it is possible to understand the diffusive origin of the exponent @xmath187 as well as to get some information about the characteristic relaxation time @xmath169 . for @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) , a typical metastable configuration of the system consists of isolated holes separated a distance of the order of @xmath32 ( see , for instance , eq .",

    "a simple model for compaction in granular media has been used to investigate some static and dynamic properties of the steady sate reached by the system in the long time limit .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows to obtain analytical expressions for some of its properties . on the other hand",
    ", it reproduces qualitatively well many of the properties found in real granular systems . in the context of static properties , this includes the gaussian shape of the volume fluctuations , the dependence of its variance on the average volume and the number of particles , and the possibility of identifying the compactivity as defined by edwards .",
    "moreover , the scenario obtained from the analysis of the model , provides an useful tool to interpret the experimental results and molecular dynamic simulations of more realistic models .",
    "this is exemplified in the critical revision carried out in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , where the need of a clear differentiation between density fluctuations at constant volume and at constant number of particles shows up .",
    "also , attention must be paid to distinguish between local and global applications of the thermodynamic theory .",
    "another issue that is worth commenting is the possible existence of negative values of the compactivity and/or the effective temperature .",
    "if the mechanical statistical description is assumed as the starting point of a thermodynamic description , there is no solid reason to deny by principle this possibility .",
    "even more , one is tempted to conclude that it is highly probable , at least at a theoretical level .",
    "negatives values of the compactivity will show up unavoidably if the number of metastable configurations is not a monotonic increasing function of the volume . the possible volume occupied by the tapped granular medium",
    "is limited by the loose and random jamming packings . in both limits",
    ", the number of possible metastable configurations can be expected to be quite reduced .",
    "the requirement of maximum or minimum space between particles impose a rather severe restriction on the allowed arrangement of the particles .",
    "therefore , it seems sensible to expect that the number of configurations for intermediate values of the volume be larger than at the extremes , presenting a maximum at some values .",
    "the same qualitative reasoning applies to the effective or configurational temperature changing the volume by the energy .",
    "the question then is why negative compactivities ( effective temperatures ) have been not identified in the experiments yet .",
    "there are two main reasons for it .",
    "the first one is that only differences of compactivities have been measured up to now , and it has often been arbitrarily assumed that the compactivity diverges in the random loose packing limit .",
    "the second reason is that negative values of the compactivity , if they exist , would correspond to the lowest density theoretically accesible region , and it can be very hard to reach in practice . in any case , this is a point that definitely deserves much more study .    in the last part of the paper ,",
    "the linear relaxation of the model has been considered .",
    "a slow relaxation , accurately represented by a kww function with exponent @xmath170 tending to @xmath186 as the parameter corresponding to the vibration intensity is decreased , has been found .",
    "moreover , the expression of the characteristic relaxation time @xmath169 has arrhenius form ( with the consistent substitution of the compactivity by the temperature ) .",
    "the behavior of the linear response function for the model is fully similar to what is observed in the relaxation of many structural glasses and also in models of glassy relaxation .",
    "it must be noted that the model discussed here was built to mimic the compaction experiment and that , consistently , the relaxation of the density starting from a loose configuration exhibits the characteristic inverse logarithmic law @xcite found in experiments @xcite .",
    "it seems interesting to experimentally investigate whether linear response in tapped granular systems is also slow and described by a kww function .",
    "if that were the case , it would be another indication of similarity between two apparently different kind of systems , granular media and structural glasses , reinforcing the link already found in other phenomena @xcite , including the existence of hysteresis cycles @xcite and memory effects @xcite .",
