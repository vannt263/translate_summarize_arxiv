    "poisson manifolds of dimension @xmath0 are known to admit symplectic realizations of dimension @xmath1 ( see @xcite or @xcite for the holomorphic case ) .",

    "something similar happens here : we are going to see that the necessary condition for the existence of a symplectic resolution is that the bivector @xmath10 should be invertible ( i.e. symplectic ) on an open dense subset of @xmath7 ( see proposition [ prop1 ] ) and our resolutions are local diffeomorphisms at these points . as a consequence",

    "many examples of symplectic resolutions exist ( see section [ sec1 ] ) .",
