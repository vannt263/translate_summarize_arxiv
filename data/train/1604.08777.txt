    "observations of the gas component of galaxies yield important information on their dynamics .",
    "for example , through the use of rotation curves , detailed knowledge of the distribution of dark matter in galaxies has become available .",
    "where rotating galaxies are not spatially resolved , their global profile ( or integrated spectrum , i.e. , the distribution of spatially integrated flux per velocity interval as a function of apparent radial doppler velocity ) still provides information on dynamical masses @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rotation velocity at radius @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the dynamical mass therefore measures the total mass content of a galaxy within a certain radius @xmath6 , including that of the dark matter .",
    "the dark matter distribution does , however , extend significantly beyond that of the visible matter , and the _ total _ dynamical mass ( i.e , as measured at the virial radius ) can not be determined in the absence of visible tracers at these large radii .",
    "dynamical mass measurements using the visible galaxy are therefore always lower limits and depend on the radius at which the measurement is made .",
    "a consistent choice for the radius @xmath6 at which @xmath0 is measured is critically important for comparisons between different galaxies , but also for measurements using different tracers in the same galaxy .",
    "for example , in local disk galaxies the hidisk typically extends significantly beyond the main stellar disk . using the outer radii of either the stellar or the hidisk will result in two different values of @xmath0 .",
    "these can only be consistently compared once the typical distribution of each of the tracers is taken into account .    for low - redshift galaxies , both atomic neutral hydrogen ( hi ) and h@xmath8",
    "are routinely used to study galaxy dynamics . h@xmath8 has the advantage that it can be observed at high spatial resolution , but it is generally confined to the optical disks of galaxies .",
    "it can also be more prone to the effects of extinction as well as random motions due to , e.g. , massive star formation .",
    "hiis easily observable in the 21-cm radio line , constituting the main gas component in most disk galaxies .",
    "it usually extends beyond the optical disk , enabling studies of the dynamics out to large radii .",
    "the hitends to have a high disk surface covering factor , and has a fairly constant surface density over most of its radial extent .",
    "many studies of the kinematics of disk galaxies thus rely heavily on hiobservations .",
    "the hiline has a disadvantage , though , in that the nature of the transition that gives rise to it makes it intrinsically faint .",
    "this makes it still challenging to observe hiat redshifts @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "future telescopes , such as the square kilometre array ( ska ) , should make these observations more feasible , but even with such large facilities , observations of hiin galaxies at @xmath10 and beyond will not be trivial ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the kinematics of galaxies at high redshift are also being obtained by observing redshifted optical emission lines such as h@xmath8 using integral field unit instruments .",
    "compared to low - redshift observations an added uncertainty in the interpretation of these kinematics is the importance of non - circular motions ( due to turbulence , winds , and/or streaming motions in non - axisymmetric potentials ) in very actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is generally expected that at higher redshifts these are more important .",
    "some early observations of the kinematics of disk galaxies at high redshift are presented in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    at higher redshifts",
    ", co has also been used as a tracer for galaxy dynamics .",
    "co lines are intrinsically much brighter than the hiline , but the co distribution is more compact and , at least at low redshift , tied to that of the stellar component ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . despite the more compact extent it is still a useful tool to study galaxy dynamics",
    ".    however , even co detections are challenging at very high ( @xmath11 ) redshifts .",
    "this is due to a combination of different factors .",
    "first , low-@xmath12 co transitions , that trace the bulk of the molecular gas , are shifted to long wavelengths that are difficult to access with current facilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , the cosmic microwave background ( which has a temperature proportional to @xmath13 ) sets the effective bottom temperature of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of any galaxy which in turn makes it difficult to detect gas at intrinsically low temperatures @xcite .",
    "lastly , if the metallicities are sufficiently low , studies at low redshift have shown that the co emission is decreased for a given h@xmath14 mass ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this will also affect measurements in main sequence galaxies at very high redshift , where metallicities are depressed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative gas tracer is the 158 @xmath1 m line of atomic carbon , c@xmath15 .",
    "this is one of the main cooling lines of the ism , and is typically the brightest line ( for exceptions see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "[ cii]is also well - known to undergo relatively large changes in its fractional cooling power relative to bolometric infrared luminosity ( tir )  the so - called `` cooling line deficit '' ( e.g. , @xcite , smith et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "at high star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density , as is found in the local universe at the highest infrared luminosities , [ cii]/tir can drop significantly . at",
    "higher redshift , however , luminous systems are often extended and can have milky - way like or even higher [ cii]/tir ratios @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite show that in low - metallicity environments c@xmath15 remains bright with respect to co and fir emission and increases in relative power as metallicity declines in resolved nearby galaxies ( smith et al . in prep ) .",
    "c@xmath15 is distributed throughout the ism and as it can be excited by collisions with electrons , hiand h@xmath14 , it is expected to trace most of the phases of the ionized , atomic and molecular ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the downside of [ cii]is that its rest - frequency is very high : at @xmath16ghz ( 158@xmath1 m ) observations of low - redshift galaxies from the ground are impossible .",
    "however , moving to higher redshifts means the frequency of the line shifts into regions of the spectrum that are observable from the ground . with the advent of alma ( particularly in bands 8 , 9 , 10 )",
    "it is therefore expected that observations of c@xmath15 can be routinely done for galaxies at @xmath17 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and in principle out to extreme redshifts ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "c@xmath15 observations are therefore likely to become an important tool in determining dynamical masses and other kinematical properties of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "a disadvantage of the high redshifts is that detailed spatial information will not be available since galaxies will be hard to resolve . as an example",
    ", an @xmath19 beam will measure @xmath20 kpc beyond @xmath21 .",
    "surface brightness sensitivity considerations make it unlikely that significantly higher resolutions can be achieved with current instruments unless significant amounts of observing time ( e.g. , @xmath22 with alma ) are invested .",
    "galaxies at these redshifts will therefore typically only be resolved by a small number of beams along their semi - major axis .",
    "this means that determinations of quantities such as the dynamical mass of systems will have to be based on global velocity profiles ( integrated spectra ) .",
    "determining a dynamical mass using this method requires a velocity width and a representative radius .",
    "the former is readily determined from the profile , but the latter is generally unknown . in practice ,",
    "a multiple of the optical radius or some other measure of the expected extent of the tracer is used .",
    "this choice is important in , e.g. , proper comparisons between the baryonic and the dynamical mass . choosing a radius that is not appropriate for the tracer used can lead to severe over- or underestimates of the dynamical mass and therefore skewed comparisons .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion on this .",
    "a spatially integrated spectrum , or ` global profile ' as it is usually called in radio - astronomy , is a general observable of galaxies , independent of their dynamical state . for the case of a rotating galaxy , with gas on circular orbits ,",
    "the global profile is defined by the rotation curve and the gas tracer distribution .",
    "the rotation curve depends on the total mass distribution within the galaxy ( including stars and dark matter ) , and the rotation velocity as a function of radius therefore does not depend on the type of tracer used to measure the velocities .",
    "the radial mass surface density distributions of the tracers can , however , differ .",
    "@xcite demonstrate how the shape of the radial distribution of the tracer has an impact on the shape and velocity width of the global profile .",
    "in other words , determining the integrated spectrum of a galaxy in either hior co will likely not lead to identical profiles ( see @xcite for examples ) . in interpreting any measurement from a global profile",
    "it is therefore important to know what tracer was used and what its likely radial distribution is .",
    "this directly affects any interpretation of the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "several papers compare the observed linewidths as measured for different tracers within this context . for example , @xcite compare h@xmath8 and hilinewidths .",
    "observed co and hilinewidths are compared in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite use simple models to quantify the effects of the radial distributions of various tracers on linewidths and the tully - fisher relation .",
    "here we discuss and compare radial profiles and spatially integrated spectra as derived from [ cii]observations . for this",
    "we will use spatially resolved [ cii]data of nearby galaxies and make a direct comparison between the overall distributions and kinematics of the [ cii ] , co and hi .",
    "the goal is to test whether global profiles derived from [ cii]measurements resemble global profiles derived from co data ( with an inherently compact tracer distribution ) or from hidata ( where the tracer is much more extended ) .",
    "we use observations of individual star - forming regions to also extend the comparison to velocity dispersions .    in sect .  2 we present the sample and the data products that we use in our analysis",
    "section 3 compares the radial profiles of the gas tracers . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the kinematics of the three gas tracers and construct spatially integrated spectra .",
    "section 5 presents measurements of the spectra of individual star forming regions .",
    "we summarize our findings in sect .",
    "the only set of galaxies where detailed , resolved information is available for all three tracers , co , hiand [ cii ] , is the overlap of the things ( hi ; @xcite ) , heracles ( co @xmath23 ; @xcite ) , and kingfish ( [ cii]158 @xmath1 m ; @xcite ) samples .",
    "galaxies in these samples were selected to mostly be disk galaxies dominated by rotation and without strong bulge or bar features . by design ,",
    "a significant number of galaxies is in common to these three surveys and can thus be used for a direct comparison of the detailed hi , co and [ cii]distribution and kinematics . for many of the galaxies in these samples detailed studies of the kinematics in the hiand co are already available ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main criterion for our sample selection was the availability of high signal - to - noise and extended hi , co and [ cii]data for each of the galaxies .",
    "this resulted in a final sample of 10 galaxies .",
    "table 1 lists this sample , along with some basic properties .",
    "a few of the galaxies have very low inclinations which would make them less suitable for dynamical mass measurements ( due to the @xmath24 correction that needs to be applied to correct the line - of - sight velocities ) ; however , we include them here as the emphasis of this paper is on a comparison of observed radial mass distributions and integrated spectra and we do not try to calculate the actual dynamical masses .",
    "in the end , the presence of a clear co detection turned out to be the most stringent criterion .",
    "for this reason our sample mostly consists of spiral galaxies . as described below",
    ", all three data sets have a similar angular resolution of @xmath25 . for a galaxy at the typical distance in our sample ( @xmath26 mpc ) , this corresponds to a linear resolution of @xmath27 kpc .",

    "these figures show that for the majority of cases the hiradial profile remains approximately constant with radius over the radial range covered here , while those of the co and [ cii]decline .",
    "the [ cii]radial distribution therefore follows that of the co more closely than that of the hi . we illustrate this",
    "further by overplotting the radial profiles for each tracer ( expressed in terms of @xmath2 ; @xcite and table 1 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "we find that the scale lengths for hi , co and [ cii]are @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "for the radii @xmath70 , the respective values are @xmath73 . in these two radial ranges",

    "[ fig : radialratio ] ( right panel ) , where we again express the radius in terms of the optical radius , @xmath2 .",
    "we also show the average value and rms spread for all galaxies combined and determined in bins of width @xmath74 .    the co/[cii]ratio declines by a factor @xmath75 between the center and @xmath2 .",
    "this implies again that the [ cii ]  is somewhat less concentrated than the co emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the hi/[cii]ratio increases by a factor of @xmath76 , consistent with a much ` flatter ' radial hi  distribution .",
    "we conclude that the [ cii ]  follows the co more closely than the hiand note that this is consistent with the finding that both co and [ cii]are approximately linear tracers of the sfr surface density , whereas hiis not ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while pixel - by - pixel comparisons are a good way to show that velocities agree with each other locally , these kind of data will not be available for the majority of galaxies studied at high redshift .",
    "for many galaxies only an integrated spectrum ( global profile ) will be available .    using the hi , co and [ cii]data cubes we determine integrated spectra of our sample galaxies by adding the total flux in each velocity channel , using only the areas where [ cii]observations were done .",
    "as these regions cover the major axes of the galaxies , the global profiles should contain most of the rotation signal of the sample galaxies .",
    "the profiles are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : globprofs ] and [ fig : globprofs_apps1][fig : globprofs_apps4 ] .",
    "due to the large difference in velocity resolution between the [ cii]data ( 239 km s@xmath42 ) on the one hand and hiand co data on the other hand ( 2.6 or 5.2 km s@xmath42 ) , we show the hiand co profiles both at their native velocity resolution ( full curves ) and also convolved in velocity ( dashed curves , using a gaussian convolution function ) to the [ cii]resolution .",
    "the coarse velocity resolution of the [ cii]data in combination with the velocity width of the galaxies means that for many of the galaxies the [ cii]data do not allow us to resolve the double horn profile that is typically seen in hiand co ( see @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : globprofs ] shows one galaxy ( ngc5055 , left panel ) where the velocity width of the galaxy as measured in [ cii]is significantly ( a factor of @xmath41 2 ) larger than the velocity resolution of the [ cii]data . despite the coarse velocity resolution , it is still possible to directly compare features in the [ cii]spectrum with those in the convolved co and hispectra . we see that for this galaxy , the [ cii]spectrum follows the convolved co spectrum more closely than the convolved hione . also shown in that figure",
    "is a more typical case ( ngc 3351 , right ) where the [ cii]velocity width is comparable to the [ cii]velocity resolution . here",
    ", no distinctive features can be made out in the spectra .",
    "this lack of features also applies to the remaining galaxies .",
    "a global profile , or integrated spectrum , is determined by both the galaxy rotation curve and the surface density profile of the tracer ( e.g. , co , hi , [ cii ] ) used to measure the velocities .",
    "as all three gas tracers are embedded in the same mass potential , the measured rotation curve will to a very large degree only depend on the _ total _ mass density as a function of radius .",
    "any difference between integrated spectra of the same galaxy , can therefore be directly attributed to differences in the radial distribution of the tracer used ( see @xcite for an extensive discussion ) . with none of the galaxies having a [ cii]radial distribution significantly different from the co distribution ,",
    "we expect spectrally resolved [ cii]global profiles to look more like the co global profiles than their hicounterparts .",
    "in the previous sections we established that the [ cii]and co radial distributions are more similar to each other than to the hidistribution .",

    "therefore , at least in nearby galaxies , it is more likely that the [ cii]emission is dominated by the contribution of the neutral gas , in which case the observed relation is due to the heating of the neutral gas by 613 ev photons which are a reasonable tracer of the instantaneous sfr .",
