    "the question of whether there is a steiner system with given parameters is one of the oldest problems in combinatorics , dating back to work of plcker ( 1835 ) , kirkman ( 1846 ) and steiner ( 1853 ) ; see @xcite for a historical account .",
    "more generally , we say that a set @xmath1 of @xmath2-subsets of an @xmath3-set @xmath4 is a _",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a summary of the large literature and applications of this field .",
    "the existence conjecture for @xmath14 was a long - standing open problem , eventually resolved by wilson @xcite in a series of papers that revolutionised design theory , and had a major impact in combinatorics . in this paper",
    ", we prove the existence conjecture in general , via a new method , which we will refer to as randomised algebraic constructions .",
    "the existence conjecture will follow from a more general result on clique decompositions of hypergraphs that satisfy a certain pseudorandomness condition . to describe this we make the following definitions",

    "suppose @xmath15 is a @xmath24-divisible @xmath37-typical @xmath6-graph on @xmath3 vertices with @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath15 has a @xmath24-decomposition .    applying this with @xmath45",
    ", we deduce that for large @xmath3 the divisibility conditions are sufficient for the existence of steiner systems . that they suffice for the existence of designs",
    "requires a generalisation to multicomplexes that we will explain later .",
    "our method gives a randomised algorithm for constructing designs and also an estimate on the number of designs with given parameters ( see theorem [ decomp : count ] ) .",
    "theorem [ hyp - decomp ] gives new results even in the graph case ( @xmath14 ) ; for example , it is easy to deduce that the standard random graph model @xmath46 whp has a partial triangle decomposition that covers all but @xmath47 edges : deleting a perfect matching on the set of vertices of odd degree and then at most two @xmath48-cycles gives a graph satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem .",
    "this is the asymptotically best possible leave , as whp there are @xmath49 vertices of odd degree and any partial triangle decomposition must leave at least one edge uncovered at each vertex of odd degree",

    "@xcite posed the question of the existence of asymptotically optimal steiner systems ; equivalently , finding @xmath53 edge - disjoint @xmath24 s in @xmath25 .",
    "this was proved by rdl @xcite , by developing a new semi - random construction method known as the ` nibble ' , which has since had a great impact on combinatorics ( see e.g.  @xcite for related results and improved bounds ) .",
    "it will also play an important role in this paper .    regarding exact results ,",
    "we have already mentioned wilson s theorem , and gustavsson s minimum degree generalisation thereof .",
    "we should also note the seminal work of hanani @xcite , which ( inter alia ) answers steiner s problem for @xmath54 and all @xmath3 ( the case @xmath55 was solved by kirkman , before steiner posed the problem ) . besides these",
    ", we again refer to @xcite as an introduction to the huge literature on the construction of designs .",
    "one should note that before the results of the current paper , there were only finitely many known steiner systems with @xmath56 , and it was not known if there were any steiner systems with @xmath57 .",
    "even the existence of designs with @xmath58 and any ` non - trivial ' @xmath8 was open before the breakthrough result of teirlinck @xcite confirming this .",
    "an improved bound on @xmath8 and a probabilistic method ( a local limit theorem for certain random walks in high dimensions ) for constructing many other rigid combinatorial structures was recently given by kuperberg , lovett and peled @xcite .",
    "their result for designs is somewhat complementary to ours , in that they can allow the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 to grow with @xmath3 , whereas we require them to be ( essentially ) constant .",
    "they also obtain much more precise estimates than we do for the number of designs ( within their range of parameters ) .",
    "another recent result , due to ferber , hod , krivelevich and sudakov @xcite gives a short probabilistic construction of ` almost steiner systems ' , in which every @xmath6-subset is covered by either one or two @xmath2-subsets .",
    "another relaxation of the conjecture , which will play an important role in this paper , is obtained by considering ` integral designs ' , in which one assigns integers to the copies of @xmath24 in @xmath25 such that for every edge @xmath59 the sum of the integers assigned to the copies of @xmath24 containing @xmath59 is a constant independent of @xmath59 .",
    "graver and jurkat @xcite and wilson @xcite showed that the divisibility conditions suffice for the existence of integral designs ( this is used in @xcite to show the existence for large @xmath8 of integral designs with non - negative coefficients ) .",
    "wilson @xcite also characterised the existence of integral @xmath23-decompositions for any @xmath6-graph @xmath23 .",
    "we make some brief comments here on our new method of randomised algebraic constructions .",
    "the idea is to start by taking a random subset of a model for the problem that is algebraically defined . for the problem of this paper ,",
    "the result is a partial @xmath24-decomposition that covers a constant fraction of the edge set , and also carries a rich structure of possible local modifications .",
    "we treat this partial decomposition as a template for the final decomposition . by various applications of the nibble and greedy algorithms",
    ", we can choose another partial @xmath24-decomposition that covers all edges not in the template , which also spills over slightly into the template , so that some edges are covered twice .    to handle the ` spill ' , we express as it as an integral design that is the difference @xmath60 of two partial @xmath24-decompositions of the underlying @xmath6-graph of the template .",
    "we apply local modifications to the template decomposition so that it includes @xmath61 , then delete @xmath61 and replace it by @xmath62 .",
    "the resulting partial decomposition of the template has a hole that exactly matches the spill , so fits together with the previous partial decomposition to provide a complete decomposition .    at this level of generality",
    ", our local modification method sounds somewhat similar to that of gustavsson , and also to the ` absorbing method ' of rdl , ruciski and szemerdi @xcite .",
    "however , gustavsson s method is inherently an argument for graphs rather than hypergraphs , and the absorbing method relies on a dense set of ` absorbing configurations ' that can not be guaranteed in the sparse setting of the decomposition problem .",
    "we also remark that our argument is by induction on @xmath6 , and so we will need to consider the general setting of typical simplicial complexes ( to be defined later ) : even if we just want to prove the existence of steiner @xmath0-systems , our proof uses the existence of @xmath63-decompositions of typical complexes with @xmath64 .",
    "a final comment is that although our quasirandomness condition resembles those used in hypergraph regularity theory , we make no use of this theory in our proof , so our constants could in principle be moderately effective ( but we do not attempt to calculate them ) .      here",
    "we gather some notation and terminology that is used throughout the paper . we write @xmath28 = \\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] and @xmath65",
    "= [ n ] { \\setminus}[m-1]$ ] . for a set @xmath1 ,",
    "we write @xmath66 for the set of @xmath6-subsets of @xmath1 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we say that an event @xmath69 holds with high probability ( whp ) if @xmath70 for some @xmath71 as @xmath72 ; note that when @xmath3 is sufficiently large , by union bounds we can assume that any specified polynomial number of such events all occur . we write @xmath73 to mean for any @xmath74 there exists @xmath75 such that for any @xmath76 the following statement holds . similar statements with more constants are defined similarly .",
    "we write @xmath77 to mean @xmath78 . throughout the paper",
