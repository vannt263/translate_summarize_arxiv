    "detecting coincidence of two events is crucial in many areas of science , such as quantum optics @xcite , biophysics @xcite , and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "most commercially available electronic coincidence detectors are based on time - to - amplitude converters @xcite and even though they have good time resolution ( @xmath010 ps ) , they are generally expensive and have relatively long dead times ( 1 @xmath1s ) . other types of commercial coincidence detectors @xcite , which use and gates , have @xmath0510 ns coincidence windows and they can still be expensive . however , many applications require much narrower window to improve the signal - to - noise ratio or to match the temporal width of the triggering event .",
    "for example , typical si single - photon counters for visible / near - infrared light have output pulses with rise times that are less than 0.5 ns , which set the lower limit of the coincidence window .",
    "moreover , in our area of interest , quantum optical information technology , multiple coincidence measurements are often needed so that cost and operational complexity are important considerations .",
    "in addition to time - to - amplitude conversion , there are alternative methods to high - speed coincidence detection . measurements using an ultrafast digital oscilloscope on two or more channels with deep storage memory allow a long time history to be recorded , whose length depends on the depth of the storage memory .",
    "this is particularly useful for system testing and debugging purposes .",
    "however , a digital storage scope is not suitable for efficient and nearly real - time measurements because of the need for extensive postdetection data processing .",
    "personal computer - based picosecond time - resolved multichannel coincidence detection relies on measuring the time difference between two events and very high time resolution of a few picoseconds can be achieved , and is often used in pump - probe fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy . the multichannel capability and",
    "ps time resolution requires expensive hardware and the method is ill suited for a simple coincidence detection of two events within a fixed time window . in this work we present a simple and low - cost circuit - board implementation of two - event coincidence detection with a variable coincidence time window as short as 1 ns and a small propagation delay of @xmath05 ns .",
    "the coincidence detector is based on positive emitter - coupled logic ( pecl ) with transistor - transistor logic ( ttl ) input / output for convenient interface with other electronic equipment , such as a single - photon counter .",
    "it can be used in a non - triggered continuous - wave ( cw ) mode or in a triggered configuration with sub - ns gating @xcite that can further improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "in addition , the circuitry has essentially no dead time and hence it can be used at rates up to hundreds of mhz .",
    "the cost benefit is significant : our coincidence detector costs less than $ 100usd .",
    "the easiest way to detect a coincidence of two events is to apply an and - logic operation to the pulses from the two event detectors , but , in general , the output pulse widths of the detectors are much longer than the desired coincidence window of a few ns .",
    "for example , in our photon counting work @xcite , the output pulse width from a commercial si single - photon counting module ( spcm ) @xcite is @xmath030 ns . yet , in order to suppress accidental coincidences it is desirable to detect the coincidence of the two photons within @xmath01 ns , limited by the @xmath0350-ps jitter of the spcm output pulse .",
    "therefore , each pulse width should be reduced to @xmath01 ns before the and operation is applied and the and gate should also be fast enough to detect the sub - ns pulse overlap .",
    "unfortunately ttl components , which are commonly used in electronic equipment including our spcms , are not fast enough to handle ns signals .",
    "our solution to this problem is to use pecl for the core of the coincidence detection system and to employ ttl ",
    "pecl translators for interface compatibility .",
    "the maximum rise or fall time for pecl is @xmath0400 ps and hence pecl is sufficiently fast for use with the si spcm .",
    "the translation from ttl to pecl does not cause a loss of timing information , but adds a common propagation delay of a maximum of 600 ps to both channels .",
    "the translation from pecl to ttl has a propagation delay of 1.55 ns and a rise time of 0.31.6 ns , but these do not affect the performance because this on / off output is fed to a counter .",
    "[ figure_circuit ] shows the block diagram of the full circuit . for each of the two input channels , a ttl signal derived from an event detector such as a spcm",
    "is translated to pecl level ( fairchild 100elt22mx ) at the ttl - to - pecl ( tp ) block .",
    "the resultant pecl pulse , which is as long as the input ttl pulse ( we shall use the si spcm @xmath030-ns output as the example throughout this work ) , is shortened by the pulse reshaper ( pr ) , and the two narrowed pulses from the two channels go through the pecl and gate ( on semiconductor mc10e404 ) for coincidence detection .",
    "finally this pecl output is translated back to ttl level ( on semiconductor mc10h350 ) at the pecl - to - ttl ( pt ) block .",
    "a disadvantage of using pecl logic to achieve low noise and high speed core logic operation is that its signal routing is more complicated than other logic families .",
    "differential interconnection between components and several termination resistors at the output of each component are required .",
    "the circuit board for pecl components requires at least three layers to provide a noise - free + 5v plane and a ground plane for the ttl components . in our implementation , we used a four - layer standard fr-4 laminate printed circuit board ( pcb ) .",
    "the line widths on the pcb were 0.25 mm ( characteristic impedance @xmath065 @xmath2 ) , except for the paths connecting to the bnc connectors where 0.5 mm line widths were used to provide 50 @xmath2 impedance matching .",
    "these impedances were calculated based on the 0.3-mm gap between the ground layer and the top layer and a dielectric constant of 4.6 for the substrate .    , @xmath3 , and @xmath4.,width=321 ]    to reshape the long input pulse into a short one , we used a not gate , an and gate and a variable delay line as shown in the schematic of fig .",
    "[ figure_short_pulse ] .",
    "the delay line was simply a short rg-58 coaxial cable whose length could be changed to determine the reshaped pulse duration ( 5 ps / mm ) .",
    "the details of the pulse reshaper circuit are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_pr_circuit ] .",
    "the dashed box is a pecl fanout buffer ( fairchild 100el11 m ) that converts the differential input into two differential outputs .",
    "the buffer @xmath5 was connected to the differential input a of the and gate with 62-@xmath2 ( r6 ) series terminations to match the characteristic impedance of the line on the pcb @xcite .    , r2 : 82.5 @xmath2 , r3 : 124 @xmath2 , r4 : 95.3 @xmath2 , r5 : 261 @xmath2 , r6 : 62 @xmath2 , c1 : 0.1 @xmath1f , cc : coaxial cable ( rg-58 , 50 @xmath2 ) , v@xmath6= 5v , v@xmath7v.,width=321 ]    the non - inverting terminal of the fanout buffer @xmath8 was connected to the inverting terminal of the input b of the and gate to implement the not gate .",
    "this not path includes the coaxial cable ( cc in fig .",
    "[ figure_pr_circuit ] ) to generate the time delay . unlike the rest of the circuit with short distances ,",
    "this long delay line required a different method for impedence matching , and we chose the thevenin - equivalent parallel termination scheme @xcite with a single - ended interconnection .",
    "we did not use a differential interconnection to avoid the use of two length - matched coaxial cables for the inverting and non - inverting paths .",
    "the non - inverting terminal of the and gate input b is biased at a reference voltage of 3.66 v , which is the mid - point between pecl logic 1 and 0 , and the voltage difference between this reference and the signal transmitted by the coaxial cable serves as the differential input of the and gate .",

    "samples / s).,width=321 ]",
    "we calibrated the timing characteristics of the coincidence detector by using two identical pulses with a variable time delay as inputs .",
    "the two input pulses were derived from the output pulse of a si spcm by splitting it into two signal pulses .",
    "the variable time delay between @xmath9 ps and @xmath10 ps was obtained by using cables of different lengths in steps of less than 1 cm ( 50 ps ) .",
    "we measured the ratio of coincidences to singles with an 80-mhz electronic counter ( national instruments 6602 ) .",
    "this counter , however , can not detect pulses less than @xmath03.5 ns in width . since the and gate output pulse width is determined by the delay lines , a timing overhead must be added .",
    "the amount of timing overhead was determined experimentally by using different lengths of delay lines and measuring the effective coincidence window as described above . in our circuitry , we increased the delay lines to 50 cm of coaxial cables ( instead of 20 cm ) to achieve a coincidence window of @xmath01 ns .",
    "it should be clear that for different counters , the cable lengths must be adjusted and the coincidence windows recalibrated .",
    "we note that care was taken to reduce signal distortion between the coincidence detector and the electronic counter by using twisted - pair connection ( awg 22 hook - up wire , @xmath01 turns / cm ) with series termination of 56 @xmath2 .",
    "[ figure_probability ] shows the timing results for the cases of 50 cm , 60 cm , and 70 cm delay lines , by plotting the coincidence probability as a function of the relative delay between the two input pulses .",
    "we note that the width of the transitional region ( defined as the region with 10@xmath1190% probability ) is @xmath0100 ps on each side for all three lengths of the delay lines .",
    "we believe that the width of the transitional region is due to the jitter of the triggering threshold of the counter . to confirm this ,",
    "pulses from a digital delay / pulse generator ( stanford research systems dg535 , 5-ps delay resolution ) were counted as the pulse width was varied about the minimum width of @xmath03.5 ns required by the counter , and we obtained the same 100-ps transitional regions .",
    "the effective coincidence window size , defined by the full width at half maxium ( fwhm ) in fig .",
    "[ figure_probability ] , is 1.2 , 2.2 , and 3.26 ns for the 50-cm , 60-cm , and 70-cm delay lines , respectively .",
    "we evaluated the performance of the coincidence detector in a quantum optics experimental setup that we modified to measure the accidental coincidences from two independent bose - einstein distributed thermal sources of photons and compared the results with theoretical expectations .",
    "two si spcms were used as independent detectors of thermal photons from room light that leaked into the single - photon counters .",
    "the detected photocount statistics follow the bose - einstein distribution for a thermal field with average singles count rates of @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the two spcms , respectively . for a coincidence window @xmath14 of a few ns",
    ", we set the singles detection probabilities to be low such that @xmath15 , in which case the coincidence probability per window is simply given by the product of the singles probabilities , @xmath16 .",
    "this yields a coincidence rate of @xmath17 . in the measurements",
    ", we counted both the coincidence and singles rates for different @xmath12 and @xmath13 and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_accidental ] .",
    "the horizontal axis is the product of the singles rates , @xmath18 , and the plotted coincidence rates show a straight line dependence for each coincidence window size with a slope that is given by @xmath14 . from the slopes we obtain @xmath14 of 1.13@xmath190.04 ns , 2.21@xmath190.03 ns , and 3.23@xmath190.12 ns for the 50-cm , 60-cm , and 70-cm delay lines , respectively .",
    "the linear dependence of the coincidence counts on @xmath20 is in good agreement with theoretical expectations , and the measured @xmath14 values agree well with the electronic timing measurements in fig .",
    "[ figure_probability ] .",
    "we have implemented a simple design of a fast electronic coincidence detector based on inexpensive pecl components .",
    "the coincidence window size can be easily adjusted by a change of the two coaxial cable delay lines and can be as short as @xmath01 ns . the detector has a low propagation delay of @xmath05 ns which allows this circuit to be used as a trigger for a more complex coincidence measurement system .",
    "also , the simplicity and low cost of the demonstrated coincidence detection scheme can be easily extended to multiple coincidence detection .",
    "adding timing overhead did not affect the performance of the coincidence detection . to characterize the coincidence detector independently of the triggering properties of the electronic counter , one can add a monostable multivibrator at the output of the and gate , which can be easily implemented using a flip - flop , a counter , and an oscillator @xcite .",
