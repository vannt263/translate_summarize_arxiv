    "that the universe is spatially flat , has a subcritical matter content and is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion are nowadays globally accepted ideas . strong evidence for this scenario come from the anisotropy and polarization spectra of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite , the galaxy power spectrum @xcite with its baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite and the hubble diagram ( hd ) of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) @xcite . what is driving this cosmic speed up and dominating the energy budget is , on the contrary , a still hotly debated question with answers running from the classical cosmological constant @xcite , scalar fields @xcite and higher order gravity theories @xcite .",
    "in order to break the degeneracies among model parameters and go to the next level of model selection , it is mandatory to probe the background evolution up to very high redshift so that the onset of the acceleration epoch and the transition to the matter dominated regimes may be directly investigated .      +    +    thanks to their enormous energy release , grbs are visible up to very high @xmath2 , the largest one being at @xmath3 @xcite , hence appearing as ideal candidates for this task .",
    "unfortunately , grbs are everything but standard candles because their peak luminosity spans a wide range .",
    "there have nevertheless been many attempts to make them standardizeable candles resorting to the use of empirical correlations among distance dependent quantities and rest frame observables @xcite .",
    "such empirical relations allow one to infer the grb rest frame luminosity or energy from an observer frame measured quantity so that the distance modulus can be estimated with an error mainly depending on the intrinsic scatter of the adopted correlation . combining the estimates from different correlations , schaefer ( 2007 ) first derived the grbs hd for 69 objects , while cardone et al .",

    "we use the updated version of the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation between the luminosity @xmath0 at the break time @xmath1 and @xmath1 itself .",
    "we first remind the reader that @xmath1 is defined as the time marking the passage from the plateau phase to the power - law decay in the grbs x - ray afterglow lightcurve as described by the universal fitting function proposed by willingale et al .",

    "recently , we have increased the grbs sample and rederived the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation ( dainotti et al .",

    "canonical _ grbs , d10 have demonstrated that they define an upper envelope for the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation with the same slope , but a higher intercept than the one for the full sample . in order to avoid mixing objects possibly belonging to two different classes",
    ", we divide the 66 grbs in two subsamples according to the value of @xmath7 being smaller or larger than 0.095 . in the first case , we select 8 grbs which we will refer to as the _ canonical _ ( c ) sample , while the remaining 58 will form the _ non canonical _ ( nc ) one . adopting a flat @xmath8cdm model with @xmath9",

    ". such a linear relation can be the outcome of a theoretical model so that one can expect that deviations from the underlying assumptions lead to the point scattering around the best fit line .",

    "we thus get :    @xmath11    with intrinsic scatter @xmath12 for the nc sample and    @xmath13    with @xmath14 for the c sample .",
    "note that these are the best fit values which have to be used in the later determination of the grb distance modulus .",
    "however , the bayesian approach allows to get the constraints on each one of the single @xmath15 by marginalizing over the other two .",
    "we thus find :    @xmath16    @xmath17    for the nc sample and    @xmath18    @xmath19    for the c sample , where we have reported the median value and the @xmath20 and @xmath21 confidence ranges . in agreement with d09 , we find that the slope is the same for the two samples , but the canonical grbs are shifted to higher luminosities thus giving a larger zeropoint and defining an upper envelope for the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation .",
    "note that the intrinsic scatter for the canonical grbs is much smaller thus leading to lower uncertainties on the estimated distance modulus .",
    "it is worth stressing that , although derived assuming a fiducial @xmath8cdm model , this has a negligible impact on the determination of the distance modulus @xcite . to strengthen this result ,",
    "we have determined the best fit parameters @xmath15 and the rms of the residuals for the c sample assuming a cpl @xcite model and varying the parameters @xmath22 while @xmath23 ( see later for the definition of these quantities ) .",
    "fig.[fig : cosmopar ] shows that the best fit calibration parameters have a clear trend with @xmath24 , but the end to end variation of @xmath25 , which enter the distance modulus estimate , is less than @xmath26 .",
    "this is well within the uncertainties on the @xmath25 coefficients so that we are confident that the choice of the fiducial cosmological model used in the calibration procedure has a negligible impact on the derivation of the hubble diagram .",
    "however , should future data allow us to increase the precision on @xmath25 , one should likely readdress this problem looking for a model independent calibration .    in order to infer the distance modulus of each grb ,",
    "we then simply note that @xmath0 is related to the luminosity distance @xmath27 as @xcite :    @xmath28    with @xmath29 the slope of the energy spectrum ( modelled as a simple power - law ) and @xmath30 the observed flux both measured at the break time @xmath1 .",
    "having measured @xmath31 and inferred @xmath0 using eq.([eq : lxtabfnc ] ) or ( [ eq : lxtabfc ] ) , we can then estimate the grb distance modulus as :    @xmath32 } \\label{eq:_estmu}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is in mpc .",
    "the uncertainty is estimated by propagating the errors on @xmath33 .",
    "note that , when computing the error on @xmath0 , we add in quadrature the uncertainty coming from @xmath1 and @xmath34 to take care of the intrinsic scatter . when resorting to eq.(4 ) , we take care of the different calibration parameters for the two subsamples thus using eq.([eq : lxtabfnc ] ) for the objects in the nc sample and eq.([eq : lxtabfc ] ) for the c sample ones .",
    "the combined hd , shown in fig.[fig : grbhdplot ] , covers the wide redshift range @xmath35 thus showing that , although the error bars at the moment are still quite large , the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation could allow us to probe of both the dark energy epoch and the matter dominated era with a single tracer .

    "we follow again wmap7 setting @xmath53 .",
    "while all these quantities ( except for the gaussian prior on @xmath54 ) mainly involve the integrated @xmath55 , the last term refers to the actual measurements of @xmath56 from the differential age of passively evolving elliptical galaxies .",
    "we then use the data collected by stern et al .",

    "the results obtained fitting this combined dataset are summarized in table 2 .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that the @xmath8cdm model is still statistically favoured by the combined dataset .",
    "the constraints on @xmath59 for this case are almost unchanged by the addition of the other data .",
    "this is expected since the data we have added help break the degeneracy between the matter content and the eos parameters . since in the @xmath8cdm case the eos is set from the beginning , the priors on @xmath60 we have used to get table 1 are essentially equivalent to the full dataset in table 2 .",
    "the situation is different for the qcdm and cpl models since the eos is allowed to vary .",
    "the combined dataset is now able to constrain @xmath61 thanks to the @xmath56 and bao data which probe the redshift range where dark energy drives the background evolution thus complementing grbs . in order to better show the impact of grbs",
    ", we have repeated the fit excluding their hd .",
    "considering , as a test case , the cpl model , we find for the maximum likelihood parameters @xmath62 close to that obtained using the grbs .",
    "the marginalized constraints now read :    @xmath63    @xmath64    comparing these values to those in table 2 shows that adding grbs does not significantly narrow the parameters confidence ranges .",
    "this is actually expected since the present grbs datasets are affected by large errors ( the nc sample ) or few statistics ( the c sample ) .",
    "however , it is worth noting that grbs help push the constraints on @xmath65 towards 0 thus suggesting that the inclusion of a large sample of canonical ( @xmath6 ) grbs may strengthen the case for a constant eos dark energy model .    up to now ,",
    "we have not used sneia since we have been mainly interested in investigating how grbs ( and the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation ) could be used as cosmological tools .",
    "having demonstrated that the inclusion of grbs does not bias the search for cosmological parameters , we finally add sneia to the above combined dataset using the constitution sample @xcite comprising 397 objects over the range @xmath66 .",
    "for the cpl model and the nc+c grbs , we get @xmath67 as maximum likelihood parameters , while the marginalized constraints on the single quantities are as follows :    @xmath68    @xmath69    not surprisingly , the maximum likelihood model is close to the @xmath8cdm @xmath70 case , while the constraints on the parameters are in full agreement with those reported in tables 1 and 2 being narrower thanks to the sneia data . in particular ,",
    "the eos parameters are now better constrained since the sneia hd mainly probes the low redshift dark energy dominated universe .",
    "we have not tried to repeat this analysis using the c sample since , due to their high number and good accuracy , sneia actually dominate the fit as can be checked by fitting sneia only without the inclusion of grbs or the other data .",
    "a _ ground zero _ test of every cosmological model is its ability to fit the observed hubble diagram .",
    "such a test tells us whether the model is able to give rise to the observed background evolution and select the region of the parameter space leading to the correct sequence of accelerating and decelerating expansion .",
    "although still being the primary tracer of the hubble diagram , sneia may trace cosmic evolution only up to @xmath71 so that it is mandatory to look for a different class of astronomical objects to go beyond this limit and investigate the matter dominated era .",
    "grbs are considered the ideal candidates for this role thus motivating the hunt for a calibration method to make them standardizeable candles .",
    "we have presented here the use of the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation as a valid method to infer the grbs hd up to @xmath3 using data coming from the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "it is worth stressing that this is the only empirical law relating quantities measured from the afterglow lightcurve rather than being related to the prompt emission quantities .",
    "moreover , differently from what has yet been done in the past @xcite , the hd for the nc+c sample is the only grbs hd based on the use of a single correlation and containing a statistically meaningful number of objects .",
    "the use of the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation then avoids the need of combining different correlations to increase the number of grbs with a known distance modulus .",
    "each correlation is affected by its own possible systematics and characterized by different intrinsic scatter so that combining all of them in a single hd can introduce unexpected features and hence bias the constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation may be significantly reduced if one considers only its upper envelope defined by the canonical grbs . on the other hand , using the full 66 grbs , we have been able to get constraints on the matter content and the present day hubble constant comparable to those yet available in literature .",
    "such a preliminary investigation has convincingly shown that the @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation may be used to construct a grbs hd which does not introduce any bias in the search for cosmological parameters .",
    "it is worth stressing that the same results have been obtained using the canonical grbs despite the fact that they represent just @xmath72 of the full sample .",
    "we therefore argue that an observational effort dedicated to look for canonical grbs may turn them from ideal candidates to actual tools for efficiently investigating the dark energy puzzle .",
