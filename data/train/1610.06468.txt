    "search and other transactional web services strive to minimize response times in order to provide a sense of interactivity and to maintain user engagement .",
    "regardless of how efficiently we implement these services , their response times are limited by roundtrip network latency , which in turn is limited by technical and physical factors , which include the speed of light . for earth - based users the physical limits imposed by the speed of light amount to less than a second of delay , even when a packet must bounce off a geosynchronous satellite .",
    "consider , however , the case of future colonists on mars , who will be between 4 and 24 light - minutes away , depending on the relative positions of the two planets .",
    "this paper explores a simple question :  is it possible to engineer around physical laws and provide a tolerable search experience from mars ?    while martian colonies may be a decade or more in the future , plans are being actively developed , with the public support of luminaries such as space entrepreneur elon musk  @xcite and edwin `` buzz '' aldrin , one of the first two people to walk on the moon  @xcite . both mars to stay and mars one propose permanent settlements , with colonists potentially living out the remainder of their lives on mars .",
    "while the idea of permanent settlements may seem like science fiction to some , there are substantial cost savings from permanent colonization , as opposed to a traditional apollo - style there - and - back - again mission , since fuel and other resources for immediate return will not be required .",
    "permanent colonists can conduct more science , over much longer periods , greatly increasing the benefits accrued from the mission .",
    "current planning assumes that colonists will simply have to tolerate communication delays , limiting their ability to use the internet .",

    "the primary contribution of this work is an articulation of the design space of how we might engineer search from mars .",
    "we model the problem as a tradeoff between `` effort '' ( waiting for responses from earth ) and `` data transfer '' ( pre - fetching or caching data on mars ) .",
    "we flesh out our design by considering two concrete tasks using publicly available data : in the first task , we build on a previous short paper  @xcite and explore high - recall retrieval ( such as conducting a scientific survey )  using data from the trec total recall track . in the second task ,",
    "we simulate interactive search sessions on mars using data from the trec sessions track . in both cases ,",
    "our work examines what researchers might call `` reasonable baselines '' .",
    "we readily concede that we do not propose any novel retrieval techniques _ per se_the value of our work lies in formulating a novel problem and laying out the groundwork for future explorations . as such",
    ", we hope that our contribution is evaluated in terms of the vision it provides for future research on interplanetary information retrieval .",
    "the problem of searching from mars is intended to be aspirational as well as inspirational .",
    "even if one remains unconvinced about interplanetary colonization in the short term , our work remains relevant in the same sense that zombie apocalypse preparations advocated by the centers for disease control are instructive .",
    "like that effort , theoretical considerations about unlikely scenarios can lead to insights with more immediate impact .",
    "in fact , search from mars can be thought of as a specific instantiation of what teevan et al .",
    "@xcite call `` slow search '' , which aims to relax latency requirements for a potentially higher - quality search experience .",
    "slow search explores latencies on the order of minutes to hours , which is similar to speed of light propagation delay to mars .",
    "there is substantial precedent for our work , as we discuss below .",
    "technologies developed for search on mars have potential applications closer to home in improving search from remote areas on earth such as easter island , where only satellite internet is available , and the canadian arctic , where internet access remains prohibitively slow and expensive .",
    "our work builds on previous efforts to enhance internet access in developing regions such as rural india , where connectivity is poor and intermittent .",
    "thies et al .",
    "@xcite explored web search over email , an interaction model that is not unlike searching from mars .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite specifically tackle the problem of search over intermittent connections , attempting to optimize the amount of interaction that a single round of downloading can enable .",
    "intermittent connections can be modeled as high latency , which makes the problem quite similar to ours  and indeed chen et al .",
    "use some of the query expansion and pre - fetching techniques we explore here .    in this work",
    ", we assume that a functional interplanetary internet already exists , and that the only problem we need to overcome is latency at the application layer .",
    "this is not an unrealistic assumption as other researchers have been exploring high - latency network links in the context of what is known as delay - tolerant networking ( see , for example , ietf rfc 4838 ) and nasa has already begun experimental deployments on the international space station . once again , there are many similarities between building interplanetary connectivity and enhancing connectivity in developing regions . examples of the latter include daknet  @xcite , deploying wifi access points on buses to provide intermittent connectivity to users along their routes and the work of seth et al .",
    "@xcite to ferry data using mechanical backhaul ( i.e. , sneakernet)which is nt very different from our proposal to put a cache of the web on a mars - bound rocket ( more details later ) .",
    "even if one accepts the premise of mars colonization , there may remain skepticism about the importance of providing web search . while challenges such as sustaining life , finding appropriate shelter , and extracting energy are no doubt paramount , the psychological health of martian colonists is important also . as the web has become an integral part of our daily lives , we believe that replicating the experience of the web on mars is an integral element of maintaining psychological well - being .",
    "the hi - seas ( hawaii space exploration analog and simulation ) missions and other previous efforts , which attempt to simulate long - duration habitation on mars , are a recognition that keeping colonists sane is just as important as keeping them alive .",
    "having accepted the premise of searching from mars , let us next flesh out some of the constraints in more detail .",
    "there exist technologies built around laser - based communication where it is possible to achieve good bandwidth between earth and mars .",
    "the lunar laser communications demonstration achieved a 622-mbps downlink and a 20-mbps uplink between the earth and the moon , so something like this to mars is technologically feasible .",
    "more bandwidth can be achieved by building more satellites , so we can probably count on `` reasonable '' bandwidth between earth and mars .",
    "the other important factor is physical transit time from earth to mars on rockets , which we can use as a vehicle for physically delivering a cache of data ( i.e. , an interplanetary sneakernet ) .",
    "missions to mars have taken between 150 and 300 days over the past half century , and without getting into details about orbital mechanics ( tradeoffs between transit time , fuel efficiency , and the prevalence of suitable launch windows ) , it suffices to say physical transport between the two planets will be on the order of months with current rocket technology .",
    "physical transport time defines a `` cache invalidation '' problem  as whatever data we put on a rocket runs the risk of becoming stale before it arrives on mars .",
    "this paper builds on two previous papers that have tackled the search from mars problem .",
    "the first is an unrefereed magazine column that to our knowledge is the first articulation of the search from mars problem  @xcite .",
    "that article articulates the vision , but lacks technical depth .",
    "the second is a short paper  @xcite that empirically examines the high - recall problem , which provide the basis of a more detailed study we describe in section  [ recallsec ] .",
    "achievable response times for searching on mars requires a tradeoff between latency and bandwidth .",
    "if the available bandwidth between earth and mars is very large , with few restrictions on usage , searching on mars need be little different than searching on earth .",
    "mars would maintain a snapshot of the earth - based portion of the web on local servers ( initially delivered by sneakernet ) , continuously updating it with the help of earth - based crawlers .",
    "although this cache would still ( unavoidably ) be 4 to 24 minutes behind earth , a searcher on mars would experience no lag .",
    "of course , if a search on mars leads the searcher to an earth - based transactional site , or to other dynamic content , that site will still be subjected to response time delays unless it too provides accommodations for extraterrestrial users , an issue we leave for future work .",
    "unfortunately , maintaining a snapshot of the earth - based web means that much of the transferred data will go unseen and unused , at least until the colony gains a sizeable population .",
    "furthermore , although details regarding communications technology are far from finalized , we imagine that bandwidth will be limited and must be used parsimoniously . while some bandwidth might be usable for speculative pre - fetching and caching , potentially wasteful usage must be justifiable by potential benefits to the colonists .    at the other extreme in this design space ,",
    "if available bandwidth between earth and mars is very limited , with usage restricted to the most critical purposes , we can do little to improve searching on mars .",
    "any kind of speculative pre - fetching or caching would waste critical resources . under these circumstances",
    ", our colonists must tolerate the lag , along with the other restrictions of pioneer life .",
    "since bandwidth limitations are unknown at present , we quantify tradeoffs in terms of two measurable values , both independent of bandwidth :    = 1em    it takes a martian longer to perform an online task , relative to the time required on earth .",
    "she requires additional time either because she has to wait longer for an interaction to happen , or because she does extra work to complete her task .",
    "for example , while waiting for a search result the martian might work on some unrelated task , or she might continue to peruse the results of a previous search while she waits for the new results to arrive . in this paper , we do not make a strong distinction between waiting and extra work , since both are wasted effort .",
    "we can send more data to mars , relative to the amount of data we would send to a user s interaction device on earth .",
    "for example , we might send extra search results , web pages , etc .  that the user might never actually view .",
    "two possible techniques are to pre - fetch results and to cache a portion of the web on mars .",
    "we can express the first value as an `` effort ratio '' , @xmath0 , where user effort might be measured in task completion time , or in some proxy , such as number of web pages viewed : @xmath1    we express the second value as a `` data ratio '' , @xmath2 , where data volume might be measured in bytes , or in some proxy , such as number of web pages transferred : @xmath3    for interactive web search , there is a tradeoff between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "if we perform no pre - fetching or caching on mars , using the search engine exactly as on earth , we have @xmath4 but @xmath0 is maximized .",
    "if we continuously send a full web crawl to mars , we get @xmath5 , but @xmath2 is maximized . on earth , @xmath4 and @xmath5 by definition .    on mars",
    ", we trade off one against the other .",
    "while @xmath0 is determined largely by the distance between the two planets and the number of roundtrip delays required to complete a task , @xmath2 may be arbitrarily large , even when little interaction is required .",
    "for example , even pre - fetching pages linked from a serp ( see section  [ serpsec ] ) increases the number of pages transferred by roughly a factor of ten , even if the user only clicks on a few ( or no ) results .",
    "as an example of the tradeoffs discussed in the previous section , we revisit a previous study that considered the problem of high - recall tasks , e.g. , scientific surveys , in the context of a permanent martian colony  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the martian searcher aims to find as much relevant material as possible while minimizing the amount of non - relevant material consumed .",
    "the previous study examined this task using cormack and grossman s autotar protocol  @xcite , which uses continuous active learning  @xcite to iteratively train a classifier based on searcher feedback collected ( for computational efficiency ) in batches .",
    "we omit the details of the underlying algorithm for brevity and encourage interested readers to review the literature .",
    "four formulations of the autotar protocol were purposed in clarke et al  @xcite .",
    "as we replicate this previous study using more realistic measurements of time , we provide a brief description of these formulations ( see figure  [ figure : scenarios ] ) :    = 1em    * earthtar * : the baseline result of running autotar on earth  the upper bound of performance .",
    "* earthtar@xmath6latency * : the result of running autotar from mars without any attempts to hide latency , i.e. , the searcher waits between batches of new documents from earth to assess .    * marstar@xmath6cache * : two versions of autotar are running , one on earth and one on mars .",
    "the martian autotar begins by running on a cache that has been shipped to mars and is incrementally added to as earth identifies new potentially - relevant documents that are shipped over to mars .",
    "earth runs its own version of autotar on the entire collection and is trained by martian assessments ( received after a delay ) .    * marstar@xmath7cache * : as above , except there is no pre - existing martian cache .",
    "thus , after the initial query , the martian must wait for a roundtrip latency before she can begin assessing documents  these documents are always the ones sent from earth .",
    "the last three formulations were compared to the earthtar upper bound to examine the impact of various roundtrip latencies . as before , we used the reuters collection volume 1 ( rcv1 )  @xcite , which comes with a fully labeled training and test set split over 103 topics .",
    "the training portion , the chronologically first @xmath824,000 documents of the collection , was used as the martian cache where applicable . in previous work",
    ", we made a simplifying assumption , that the time to judge a document was one light minute , i.e. , in four light - minutes of latency between earth and mars , the searcher could judge four documents .",
    "such an assumption makes for easy computation but is not necessarily realistic as it may take seconds to judge a document but minutes to transmit a document .",
    "to more accurately model the real scenario , we use smucker and clarke s model  @xcite of reading speed to calculate time to read and judge a document for our martian searchers .",
    "their model predicts that for a document with _",
    "l _ words it would take @xmath9 seconds to read the document .    the assumption that reading time was equivalent to transmission time meant that our previous work used arbitrary latencies between earth and mars , ranging from 5 units of time to 500 units of time . in our replication , we use roundtrip latencies of 8 and 48 minutes ",
    "these function as minimum and maximum delays that we might expect .    figure  [ fig : tr - replication ] plots the recall achieved as a function of the amount of time spent searching , including any perceived latency , for the two levels of roundtrip latency .",
    "these results agree with those reported previously but provide a more accurate picture of what might be conceivably experienced on mars .",
    "it is apparent that a small martian cache is sufficient to achieve comparable performance with earth .",
    "even with no cache , mars is quickly able to `` catch up '' to earth - like effectiveness .",
    "furthermore , we note that in the context of high - recall retrieval , there is no wasted transmission .",
    "that is , to be sure all relevant material is identified , a searcher must exhaustively examine the entire corpus , regardless of the underlying retrieval protocol , rather than traditional web search where a searcher may examine only one or two documents returned by a serp .",
    "it is worth noting that at any given point in time , the marstar solution may have resulted in additional non - relevant documents being received by mars when compared to earthtar .",
    "the plots show , however , that such a discrepancy appears to be relatively small .    ....    ...",
