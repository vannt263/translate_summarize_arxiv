    "the citation patterns of scientific publications form a rather complex network . here",
    "the nodes are published papers and a link is formed if one paper cites another paper published previously . in",
    "@xcite the citation distribution of @xmath9 papers cataloged by institute of scientific information ( isi ) and also the @xmath10 papers published in physical review d ( prd ) between @xmath11 and @xmath12 was studied . it was found that the probability @xmath13 that a particular paper is cited @xmath1 times follows a power law distribution @xmath14 with exponent @xmath15 , indicating that the incoming degree distribution of the citation network is scale - free .",
    "later these studies were extended @xcite to the outgoing degree distributions as well , and it was shown that it has an exponential tail in most cases . + the citation distribution provides an interesting platform for theoretical modelling when the various features of citation dynamics are taken into account .",
    "it must be kept in mind that citation is possible only to papers that have been published _ previously _ , i.e , _ older _ papers , so that the network is _",
    "directed_. also since most of the papers are gradually forgotten or become irrelevant , the probability that a particular paper is cited should decrease in time unless it is of utmost importance .",
    "again , a _ young _ paper , which is undergoing recognition , gains increasing attention through citations . hence the model of a citation network should be one in which _ aging _ of the papers occur such that the probability of a paper getting cited depends on its age .",
    "again , from the scale - free nature of the degree distribution , it appears that the probability of a paper being cited at a given time is proportional to its in - degree .",
    "the distribution of ages of cited papers was studied for small sample sizes in @xcite and @xcite and the results from these two studies did not agree .",
    "the complete set of citations for all publications in physical review ( pr ) journals from july @xmath16 to june @xmath17 was later studied in @xcite which perhaps gives the closest possible picture of the citation scenario .    among the various features of a citation network , those which are relevant to the present paper",
    "are listed below : + ( i ) the distribution @xmath18 of ages @xmath2 of citations to other publications : this is calculated from the difference of the year of publication of a particular paper and the year of publication of the papers which are cited by it .",
    "+ ( ii ) the distribution @xmath19 of citation ages @xmath2 from citing publications calculated from the difference of the year of publication of a particular paper and the year of publication of the papers citing it .    fig .",
    "1 shows pictorially how the two distributions are generated .",
    "\\(iii ) the correlation of the average age of citing papers as a function of the degree @xmath1 of that paper : this is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "it is expected that for a paper with many citations the average age of the citations will also be large such that there is a positive correlation between the two .    for @xmath18",
    "it was found that in the range of @xmath21 to @xmath22 years , the distribution decays _ exponentially _ with time , while for longer times the decay is a slower exponential . for @xmath19 , over the limited range of @xmath21 to @xmath23 years , the integrated data is consistent with a power law decay with an exponent @xmath24 .",
    "hence , authors tend to have an exponentially decaying memory while citing papers , but the citation age distribution to a particular paper has a slower power law decay over an initial period of time ( _ lifetime _ of the paper ) .",
    "the pr data showed that there is indeed a positive correlation between average citation age and the number of times that a paper has been cited ( property ( iii ) ) and the relation is consistent with a power law .    in the present paper",
    "we have attempted to obtain a suitable model for the citation network such that it may reproduce some of the main results that were obtained from the study of real citation networks . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief review of time dependent networks , where we discuss the results of some earlier works . in section iii ,",
    "the results for @xmath19 from the known models are discussed and we find that these models are not appropriate for the citation network . in section iv , we propose a modified model which can reproduce some of the real results to an appreciable extent .",
    "finally in section v , we provide a summary and also the conclusions of the present work .",
    "the question of time dependence in the attachment probability of the incoming nodes in a growing network has been studied in a few theoretical models @xcite .",
    "these models have basically evolved from the original barabasi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite where in a growing network model , a new node gets linked to the existing ones following a preferential attachment to nodes with larger degree . in the time dependent models , a new node gets attached to older nodes with a preferential attachment which is dependent on the degree as well as the age of the existing node .",
    "we discuss briefly below some relevant age dependent models and the results thereof .",
    "+ in general , in all the models of aging networks , the attachment probability @xmath25 is taken to be a separable function of the degree @xmath1 and the age @xmath2 of the existing node such that @xmath26 in the dorogovtsev - mendes ( dm ) model @xcite , @xmath27 and @xmath28 were considered .    in this model",
    "the degree distribution was found to be scale free for values of @xmath29 . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the age dependence presents a competing effect to the preferential attachment , but for @xmath31 , the older nodes get richer , enhancing the _rich gets richer_ effect .",
    "+ in @xcite an exponential decaying function @xmath32 was chosen and it was found that the model is not scale - free for any negative value of @xmath33 .    in @xcite , the dm model was further generalised by incorporating a power law variation of the degree in the attachment probability @xmath34 ,    @xmath35    a phase diagram was obtained for this model in the @xmath36 plane , with the phase boundary dividing the phase space into the small world and regular network regions .",
    "scale free behaviour was found to exist only along a line for @xmath37 . in the small world region , there was gel formation beyond @xmath38 , while the degree distribution was stretched exponential for @xmath39 .",
    "evidently a time dependent model would be appropriate for the citation network .",
    "one can immediately realise that the time dependent part @xmath4 of the preferential attachment probability ( 1 ) is analogous to the function @xmath18 defined in section i. the task is to investigate whether assuming an exponential decay in @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) gives us the proper behaviour of @xmath19 .    in our theoretical model ,",
    "we first take two standard forms of time dependence in @xmath25 and look at the behaviour of the corresponding @xmath19 using a numerical simulation .",
    "the decay of @xmath4 is assumed to be ( a ) power law and ( b ) exponential .",
    "the choice of a power law behaviour in the attachment probability may be regarded as of theoretical interest mainly as @xmath18 has been observed to have an exponential decay @xcite .",
    "however , the power law model is quite well studied and it may be useful to get the results from both models and compare them with the real data .",
    "we also use a power law dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 .",
    "the degree distribution has already been studied for most of these models .",
    "therefore we are primarily interested in calculating @xmath19 , which is related to the degree distribution when its average is under consideration .    in our simulations",
    "we have generated networks with @xmath41 nodes and @xmath42 configurations for the power law time dependence of the attachment probability , while for the exponential time dependence , we have used a maximum of @xmath43 nodes and @xmath44 configurations .",
    "let the @xmath45th node born at time @xmath46 get @xmath47 links at time @xmath48 .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of @xmath47 as a function of the corresponding age @xmath49 .",
    "it may be noted that the cumulative sum @xmath50 is a well - studied quantity in many networks as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath46 and in many network models like the ba or dm model it behaves as @xmath51 where @xmath52 has a power law growth for large @xmath53 , e.g. , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . in more complicated models ,",
    "e.g. , accelerated models @xcite , @xmath56 may have a non - trivial dependence on both @xmath48 and @xmath46 . in any case , as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath57 will have a strong @xmath46 dependence .",
    "for the distribution of the ages of citing papers , we therefore find it more convenient to tag an arbitrary node and study the number of links @xmath19 it gets as a function of @xmath2 suppressing the index @xmath46 .",
    "the price we pay for this is that since there is no averaging there is greater fluctuation .",
    "the node we tag also has to be an early one such that data over a long period is obtainable .    in the following , we detail our findings from the simulations using two different schemes .",
    "iii.i _ scheme(a ) _ : in the first scheme , the attachment probability is given by @xmath58 .",
    "we have simulated the network for @xmath59 and @xmath60 and different values of @xmath61 . throughout the simulations , we have tagged node number 10 ( the results do not change if we change this number keeping it an early node ) .",
    "the @xmath62 case corresponds to the dm model . from the behaviour of @xmath63 here , one can guess that @xmath19 will have a form @xmath64 this behaviour is observed for large values of @xmath2 and the agreement becomes worse as @xmath33 becomes more negative .",
    "we are more interested in the small @xmath2 behaviour here , which turn out to be far from a power law .    for @xmath65",
    "once again we obtained a similar variation of @xmath19 .",
    "power law regions might exist for @xmath66 and @xmath67 with exponents @xmath68 respectively",
    ". however , @xmath69 may not be a very interesting region as it has already been found that there is no scale - free behaviour here .    for @xmath70 behaviour of @xmath19",
    "changes : there is apparently a power law region with exponent @xmath71 during early times and later it becomes a constant .",
    "the later behaviour is not consistent with the citation results where @xmath19 decays rapidly for large @xmath2 .",
    "these results for the three different @xmath72 are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    iii.2 .",
    "_ scheme ( b ) _ : the attachment probability for the second scheme is given by @xmath73    in @xcite and @xcite the behaviour of @xmath18 was found to be exponentially decaying .",
    "we have therefore taken a model with @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "we have also generalised the model of @xcite to include a nonlinear functional dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath1 .",
    "this is because the @xmath62 case showed that there is no scale free region for negative @xmath33 .",
    "a scale free region may only be obtained for values of @xmath76 when @xmath30 .    for the exponential time dependence in @xmath25 ,",
    "once again we study @xmath19 , the age distribution of the citations to a tagged paper for the values of @xmath77 keeping @xmath78 .",
    "in this case , power law is not obtained anywhere for @xmath19 . for each value of @xmath72 , we show in fig . 3 @xmath19 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( these values are comparable to the observed values ) .",
    "we are in search of a minimal model and find that the simple models described in the previous section are not sufficient . to add more features , we note that there are many differences between these models and a real citation network , prominent among which are the following + ( i ) in these models , only one paper is being cited by each paper + ( ii ) in each year , it is being assumed in these models that only one paper is being published .",
    "( note that the unit of time for the real data had been 1 year ) .",
    "+ both these are gross simplifications and the real network is quite different .    in order to make the smallest changes , we incorporate suitable modifications in the models described in section iii such that only one of the two factors mentioned is considered at a time .",
    "this way , it will be also be clear which are the indispensible features of the citation network .",
    "we take the exponential model where the attachment probability is given by ( 6 ) because we wish to proceed with a model in which the time dependent part in the attachment probability has an exponential decay to mimic reality .    keeping everything else same , when each new node is allowed to have more than one citation ( typically 10 or 20 )",
    "we find that there is no significant change in the behaviour of @xmath19 .",
    "next , again sticking to the exponential model with one citation , we consider @xmath81 number of publications each year ( @xmath82 ) . in the simulation , this means we are putting the time label differently , the first @xmath81 nodes have @xmath83 , the next @xmath81 nodes @xmath84 etc . with @xmath85 , we find that the behaviour of @xmath19 is indeed a power law for @xmath86 , when the value of @xmath70 and @xmath87 with an exponent @xmath88 .",
    "4 ) . decreasing the value of @xmath72 , the power law behaviour worsens .",
    "there maybe some optimum values of @xmath72 and @xmath33 for which the value of the exponent @xmath89 is closer to the observed 0.94 @xcite or some more modifications of the basic model maybe required to achieve a better quantitative agreement .",
    "our present objective is not to obtain precise values but rather to obtain the simplest possible model that has an exponentially decaying @xmath4 giving a power law decay in @xmath19 .",
    "once we have achieved the primary goal , it is important to find out the behaviour of the degree distribution @xmath13 and the correlation between average age of citations @xmath20 to a paper and its degree @xmath1 .",
    "here we find that @xmath20 has a power law type increase as has been observed in @xcite when @xmath85 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath92 , which corresponds to the model described in iii.2 , it is definitely not a power law ( fig .",
    "hence at least two features of the present model are consistent with the observations of @xcite .",
    "lastly , we check the degree distribution . for a few initial decades of @xmath1 ,",
    "it does give a fairly good agreement with a power law decay of the form @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "however , there is a increase in @xmath13 for very large @xmath1 values which indicates a tendency to form a gel ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in fact",
    ", the curvature of @xmath13 is opposite to that of the observed distribution reported in @xcite .",
    "the possible reasons for this departure from reality is discussed briefly in the next section .",
    "we have attempted to construct a simple model for citation network in which the evolution rule is formulated according to the behaviour of real citation data .",
    "since aging is an important factor in citation data , our emphasis has been on the age distribution of references made _ by _ a paper @xmath18 and made _ to _ a paper @xmath19 .",
    "the interesting observation was that @xmath19 has a power law decay for early @xmath2 while @xmath18 has an exponential decay , which is rather counter - intuitive .",
    "indeed , the standard aging network models fail , but simple modification of the exponential model is able to reproduce the correct behaviour of @xmath19 , at least qualitatively .",
    "it is in general not quite easy to construct a single model of citation network which can reproduce all its features @xcite .",
    "this may be due to certain distinctive features of the citation network of which we mention a few below .",
    "\\(i ) apart from mathematical quantities like the degree and age of a paper , the content of a paper is also important .",
    "evidently a paper on a topic where a large number of people work , will get more citations ( that can be quantified by the _ impact parameter _ of a paper ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) neither the number of citations nor the number of papers published each year remains constant . + ( iii ) in the models , one assumes smooth behaviour , e.g. , of @xmath18 while in reality the variations are non - monotonic . ( iv )",
    "there is a possibility of `` death '' of a papers , or the separate existence of dead and live papers as referred to in @xcite .    in our modified model , although we have obtained good agreement of the behaviour of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but for @xmath13 the behaviour does not agree very well with the observations",
    ". this may be because we have not optimised the values of @xmath72 and @xmath33 to get better agreement with the real data and also due to the reasons stated above .",
