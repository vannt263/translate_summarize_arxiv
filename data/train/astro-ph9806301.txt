    "any ( realistic ) pbh - producing model of inflation must yield a power spectrum that is consistent with cobe on large scales ( @xmath0 ) , while at the same time giving @xmath1 on some small scale .",
    "such models are possible , however , as we explain below and in detail  @xcite , the large - amplitude small - scale power can lead to non - gaussian fluctuation statistics .    let @xmath2 represent the inflaton",
    ". during inflation , quantum fluctuations in the inflaton , @xmath3 , generate density perturbations .",
    "the density fluctuations at horizon crossing map to the following expression as the field rolls down the potential : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the time derivative of @xmath2 .",
    "if the classical trajectory of @xmath2 is unaffected by quantum fluctuations , the fluctuations evolve linearly and gaussian statistics prevail .",
    "this is true in most models of inflation . over a hubble time",
    ", the change in @xmath2 due to its classical trajectory is @xmath6 .",
    "gaussian statistics are then likely provided @xmath7 . but notice the following relation : @xmath8 the gaussian criterion breaks down as the amplitude of @xmath9 gets large .",
    "therefore , if we do have some inflation model that produces the @xmath1 needed for pbh formation , we may expect non - gaussian statistics to be important .",
    "in order to test the the qualitative ideas presented in the previous section , we have constructed several ( toy ) pbh - producing inflation models and used stochastic inflation calculations to find the associated fluctuation statistics  @xcite .",
    "for example , figure 1 shows a typical probability distribution of fluctuations from one of our models together with a gaussian distribution with the same standard deviation .",
    "note that the gaussian over produces large fluctuations relative to the derived distribution .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "one important consequence of this non - gaussian result is that it intensifies the fine - tuning problem in pbh formation .",
    "the fine - tuning problem arises because the height of the peak in power , @xmath10 , ( where @xmath11 is the mass of pbhs produced ) must be fine - tuned to an extremely precise value in order to obtain a cosmologically relevant fraction of pbhs without over - production .",
    "limits on pbh abundances are often quoted in terms of the initial mass fraction of pbhs @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "primordial black holes form when @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath14 is the distribution of fluctuations on a mass scale @xmath11 with an rms deviation @xmath10 , the value of @xmath12 is determined by integrating over the high-@xmath9 tail of the distribution , ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the result will depend on the ratio , @xmath16 ( _ i.e. _ the size of a pbh - producing fluctuation relative to the rms deviation ) .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath12 plotted against this ratio for a gaussian distribution ( dashed line ) and the non - gaussian case ( solid line ) plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the horizontal lines show the range of cosmologically interesting values of @xmath12 over all relevant pbh masses .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath12 changes drastically for small changes in the relevant ratio for both distributions , but is even worse for the non - gaussian expectation .    for the non - gaussian case , @xmath16 must fall between 2 and 3 in order to be cosmologically relevant at any mass scale .",
    "this precision must occur within a spike in power that is @xmath17 orders of magnitude above the cobe normalization .",
    "the upshot is that any inflation model that attempts to construct cosmologically relevant pbh formation must be tuned to at least @xmath18 , and if we restrict ourselves to any specific mass scale , the required tuning becomes much worse .",
    "in the standard linear treatment of inflationary fluctuations @xmath19 .",
    "so , to first order we may infer the probability distribution of density fluctuations by deriving the distribution of @xmath2 fluctuations .",
    "however , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the density fluctuations are large , any nonlinearity in the connection between metric perturbations and field fluctuations may change the distribution shape .",
    "one should formally understand this relationship by coupling field fluctuations to the einstein equations during inflation .",
    "this problem was explicitly noted by ivanov  @xcite , who presented a pbh - producing model using a flat plateau feature in the inflaton potential . because the region is exactly flat",
    ", the ivanov model yields a near gaussian distribution of field fluctuations or , equivalently , a near gaussian distribution in the stochastic time , @xmath20 , that the inflaton spends in the flat region of the potential ( the region associated with pbh production ) .",
    "ivanov chooses to relate metric perturbations to this stochastic time delay using the _ ansatz _ : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the value of the hubble parameter associated with the flat region of the potential . in the limit of small @xmath23",
    ", this relation reduces to the standard gauge invariant quantity . the proposed exponential relation between @xmath20 and @xmath23 , when combined with the near gaussian distribution in @xmath20 ,",
    "yields a positively skewed distribution of @xmath23 .",
    "note , however , that this result is based entirely on the _ ansatz_. the relation favored by bond and salopek  @xcite is @xmath24 , which produces a linear transformation and , thus , an effectively gaussian distribution in @xmath23 .",
    "understanding the nature of the mapping between derived @xmath25 statistics and @xmath9 statistics could be important in determining the exact nature of fluctuation distributions associated with pbhs .",
    "however , since the standard treatment yields a linear relationship , the exponential relation discussed above should , perhaps , be viewed as an extreme possibility .",
    "we are currently attempting to clarify this issue , but advocate the linear mapping as a first approximation until a more strongly motivated relation can be found .",
