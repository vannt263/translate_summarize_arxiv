    "the simplest model consistent with many observations is that the stars in massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ) formed in a single short burst at high redshift and evolved passively ( i.e. , with no further star formation ) thereafter .",
    "the dramatic expansion of data from high - quality wide - area galaxy surveys and deep lookback studies has permitted the rigorous testing of this picture , revealing a more complex formation and assembly history .",
    "present - day clusters contain a tight red sequence of galaxies , indicating early and uniform star formation histories @xcite . as fossil records of cluster assembly ,",
    "red sequences were found to evolve nearly passively since @xmath12 @xcite , suggesting negligible ongoing star formation .",

    "the single short burst model predicts that the red sequences become bluer and wider nearer their formation epoch , a trend found by @xcite and @xcite in two clusters at @xmath15 .",
    "this passive view is brought into question by some observations of clusters at @xmath16 . while @xcite found that the colors of cluster galaxies at @xmath3 are consistent with the passive evolution of a group of stars formed in a short burst at @xmath17 , the @xmath16 candidates favor an earlier formation .",
    "@xcite found that cluster galaxies characteristic @xmath18 and @xmath19 magnitudes ( from the _ spitzer _  deep , wide - field survey ( sdwfs , * ? ? ? * ) ) evolve in a manner consistent with little mass assembly at @xmath20 ( see also , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but are systematically fainter than the extrapolation of passive models at @xmath21 ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we now know the red sequence is a snapshot of the currently quiescent galaxies , and that galaxies evolve both on and off during formative events .",
    "such transformations @xcite may cause the red sequence s average stellar age to evolve more slowly @xcite than predicted by the single - burst model",

    "this process aligned the wfc3 and optical images so that pixels in all images for a given cluster covered precisely the same regions of the sky .      from the reduced and registered images , we measure fixed - aperture photometry using source extractor ( se ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in dual - image mode with sources detected in the wfc3/f160w images . for comparison",
    "we compute colors using aperture diameters of @xmath38 , and choose @xmath39 for our default color as a reasonable balance between preventing interference in our crowded fields and intersecting a physically representative portion of each galaxy .",
    "we also constructed colors using galaxy - specific apertures scaled to the half - light radius .",
    "we manually inspected the cmrs made with each aperture , and found little change in the appearance and location of the red sequences .",
    "our results are thus insenstive to our choice of photometric aperture .",
    "we use se s mag@xmath40auto in the f160w band as an approximate total magnitude for our cmrs .",
    "differences in etg color profiles may cause a bias in cmr properties owing to our fixed - aperture color photometry .",
    "the aperture tests described above suggest that the intrinsic widths of the color distributions dominate this bias for most galaxies . furthermore , in what follows we assume that the slope of the rest - frame cmr matches that of the coma cluster , in which the slope was measured @xcite in an aperture corresponding to a nearly identical physical scale as the one used herein . if high - redshift ellipticals form the cores of present - day etgs ( e.g. , as suggested by the measurements of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then we expect minimal bias owing to this effect .",
    "our photometric uncertainties are dominated by sky shot noise , which we estimate in each image from the distribution of fluxes through 5000 randomly - placed apertures with a diameter matched to our catalogs .",
    "the flux distribution is to a good approximation normal except for the sources contaminating the positive half .",
    "we compute the background level @xmath41 by fitting a normal distribution to the negative half .",
    "we verified this procedure by confirming that it produces the correct scaling in photometric scatter of sources detected in the sets of dither images before making the final stack .",
    "we calculated the standard completeness of the wfc3/f160w - selected catalogs by generating artificial objects with known total magnitude and @xmath42 light profiles where @xmath43 is distributed as a rayleigh function with @xmath44 pixels ( @xmath45 arcseconds , or @xmath46 kpc at @xmath47 ) , matching well the observed se - derived @xmath43 distribution for sources in these fields .",
    "we found that the wfc3/f160w - detected catalogs for each cluster are more than @xmath48 complete at an ab magnitude of @xmath49 , and every field is roughly @xmath50 complete at @xmath51 , which is approximately @xmath52 2223 for these redshifts .",
    "@xmath51 is the magnitude cut we impose for the cmr analysis presented in this work ( section  [ ss : selection ] ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "as seen in previous work , the immediate result of the delay between the galaxies formation and their settling on the red sequence is that cluster red sequences  continue to remain redder and narrower than any single sbsp  or csfr  model implies , even while the red sequence  is sparse or tenuous as observed in some cases ( section  [ ss : cmrassumption ] ) , presumably before they are fully formed .",
    "the feature that inferred ages appear more or less constant at @xmath29 is a natural consequence of the stars entering high - redshift etg samples having been drawn from a history with an _ increasing _ star formation rate .",
    "this scenario was observed in distant galaxies ( @xmath53 ) by , for example , @xcite and @xcite , suggesting that the galaxies in assembling clusters may be imprinted with this rising - sfr signature from their gas accretion epoch . in that case , for a given delay @xmath54 , the dominant stellar population in the optical at any time resembles an sbsp  formed a time @xmath54 ago .",
    "our third such model experiences a rapid decrease in the sf - assembly delay at @xmath55 , possibly mimicking the result of a dramatic enhancement to star formation in galaxies falling into the cluster , such as a merger with a star - forming group or a temporary increase in smooth gas accretion .",
    "this demonstrates one plausible effect that can make assembling cmrs bluer ( or wider ) for a time ( cf .",
    "cluster iscs  j1426.5 + 3339 ( @xmath56 ) ) , which may be necessary or expected during this epoch .",
    "we do not claim that our data are yet able to constrain this type of model in detail , but these models do provide some evidence that such scenarios , and perhaps combinations thereof , might naturally occur in a sample like the iscs .",
    "the color scatter measurements provide an additional constraint , because they reflect the extent to which the star formation episodes of the cluster etgs ( at fixed color ) were correlated .",
    "we demonstrate specific variants of this in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : delta ] ; the assembly - inspired models can yield the necessary slowly - varying ( or increasing ) color scatter as time progresses for clusters at @xmath57 . in these models ,",
    "each `` galaxy '' is an uncorrelated sbsp  formed at a random time such that the correct average sfh is borne out in a large sample .",
    "therefore the correlation between model etg star formation episodes reflects only the correlation implied by the underlying sfh ( e.g. , when it peaks , galaxies forming at that time will have correlated sfhs ) , and so any such scatter models could be considered as upper limits .",
    "the model tracks we show in this work are @xmath58 magnitudes bluer than clusters at @xmath3 , reflecting either a possible systematic offset in the photometric systems between the model and sample ( here we merely quote the numeric values from the cited works ) , that cluster galaxies experience an earlier peak in their star formation than the sfh we assumed , or that massive cluster etgs at low redshift have a slightly higher than solar metallicity .    while order - unity departures from roughly solar metallicity in cluster etg stellar populations are inconsistent with their evolution at @xmath3 , the metallicity evolution in cluster etg progenitors at @xmath59 is unclear .",
    "the color and scatter trends we have observed here , at a fixed formation epoch ( @xmath60 ) using our sbsp  or csfr  models , would imply that the luminosity - weighted average stellar metallicities decrease by a factor of @xmath61 during approximately @xmath62 at @xmath8 .",
    "this by itself is perhaps unphysical , but if it does contribute , it again implies stellar mass growth , in this idealized case owing to the incorporation of relatively low - mass ( low - metallicity ) galaxies . like our toy models at fixed metallicity but evolving average age , this scenario would suggest significant ongoing star formation near cluster cores , and assembly into cluster cores , over an extended period at @xmath63 . in reality",
    "both effects might contribute to the observed trends at this epoch , when assembling clusters contain massive galaxies ( high - z , early @xmath64 ) , but grow their red sequences  rapidly by incorporating or growing lower - mass ( lower - z , late @xmath64 ) galaxies @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have not separated the elliptical versus s0 galaxy samples , and therefore the apparent evolution of the etg population may owe to an increasing population of s0 galaxies ( and not necessarily ellipticals ) with time , extending the results of , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "subsequent analyses will determine the evolution of the cluster galaxies morphologies .",
    "we studied sensitive , high - resolution , rest - frame optical imaging of the central regions in 13 spectroscopically confirmed infrared - selected galaxy clusters at @xmath8 that are plausible progenitors of today s massive clusters with @xmath2 . in 11 of these clusters we measured the cmr of red galaxies at a color consistent with the cluster s known redshift , and subsequently we analyzed the stellar populations implied by the location and dispersion of the red sequence .",
    "we find the following :    1 .",
    "red sequences of bright galaxies are present in the centers of many clusters by @xmath47 .",
    "however , the properties of their cmrs indicate large cluster - to - cluster variations in the formation histories of cluster galaxies observed at a given redshift .",
    "2 .    as a function of redshift from @xmath65 ,",
    "the median rest - frame @xmath66 color of cluster galaxies in this sample is nearly constant at @xmath67 , and the scatter about the median color is nearly constant at @xmath68 .",
    "some clusters deviate widely from these trends , and outliers may represent contamination by dust - obscured galaxies , the evolution of galaxies through the `` green valley '' , or red sequences that are not yet fully formed .",
    "3 .   the flatness of the color and scatter trends at @xmath8 requires star formation histories more diverse than a single short burst in the past .",
    "these average trends are plausibly in part the result of progenitor bias , where the progenitors of lower - redshift cluster etgs are excluded by the sample selection at higher redshifts .",
    "4 .    across this redshift range , these average colors and scatters both imply a roughly constant luminosity - weighted stellar age in the cluster rsgs , where the time since the bulk of stars formed is roughly @xmath69 gyr , and the time since star formation halted is roughly @xmath70 gyr",
    "a constant stellar age is a natural consequence of observing the center of an assembling halo whose final stellar population is experiencing ongoing or increasing star formation at the observed redshift .",
    "if the red sequence stars are nearly completely in place , they would reflect a small continuing star formation rate and their luminosity - weighted ages should increase with time .",
    "by contrast , at @xmath71 our observations imply that significant current star formation is occuring that will contribute to the stellar populations of central cluster galaxies by @xmath12 .",
    "6 .   assuming the star formation of cluster galaxies follows that of other systems , the color and scatter trends we find are consistent with a factor of two growth in the cluster red sequences from @xmath65 . 7 .",
    "these observations lend credence to the idea that the red sequence in the centers of clusters was growing rapidly at @xmath71 , where this mass assembly was likely in the form of relatively younger , smaller , and/or metal - poorer galaxies that were actively growing in their recent past .",
