    "the era of gravitational - wave ( gw ) astronomy is fast approaching .",
    "the advanced versions of the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ; ;  @xcite , @xcite ) and virgo  ( @xcite ) are expected to make their first detections within the coming decade .",
    "furthermore , construction has begun on the large scale cryogenic gravitational wave telescope ( lcgt ;  @xcite ) , and an additional advanced detector in western australia ( referred to as ligo - australia or lau in this work ) is under serious consideration @xcite . inspiraling and merging compact - object binaries , composed of neutron stars ( ns ) and/or stellar - mass black holes ( bh ) , are promising sources for these detectors . for an advanced ligo ",
    "virgo network , predicted event rates for ns ",
    "ns binaries range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 year@xmath7 ( with 40 being the `` realistic '' number given in  @xcite ) detectable to distances of several hundred mpc , and approximately similar numbers apply for ns@xmath8 bh binaries with detectable distances @xmath9 gpc .",
    "nearly face - on merging ns binaries are considered likely progenitors of short hard @xmath10-ray bursts ( shbs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that ns binary mergers , irrespective of their orientation , may produce radioactive decay powered transients with absolute magnitude peak luminosities of @xmath11 in the optical at @xmath12 day timescales .",
    "thus , joint gw and electromagnetic ( em ) observations can constrain the physics of generic ns binary mergers , the central engine and outflows of short grbs , as well as cosmological parameters ( see  @xcite ;  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth n10 ) ) .",
    "gw events should , therefore , be localized on the sky to sufficient accuracy to enable a match with their em counterparts .",
    "henceforth , we use the terms `` sky localization '' to refer to the measured sky position and its associated error uncertainty , while `` sky errors '' applies only to area estimates .    for the typical ns binary inspiral event ,",
    "whose duration is a few to tens of minutes in the detector frequency band , a single interferometer has a broad antenna pattern , and hence poor directional sensitivity .",
    "two detectors restrict the sky localization to a single ring . in a network of three or more interferometers ,",
    "relative arrival times of signals at each detector allow for the reconstruction of the source s sky location to within a generally elliptical error area of 1100@xmath13 . for initial and advanced gw detector networks ,",
    "previous studies @xcite have explored sky errors for sources with both unmodeled ( `` burst '' ) and modeled waveforms using analytically derived timing formulae and fisher - matrix methods . at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr @xmath14 ) such methods are effective , providing lower bound error ellipses centered on the true values of the parameters of interest .",
    "however , the majority of sources for ligo will be detected near threshold ( @xmath15 ) . as discussed in n10 and  @xcite , at `` low '' snr ( @xmath16@xmath17 )",
    ", parameter degeneracies can lead to quantitative and _ qualitative _ errors in the fisher - matrix approximation of the posterior probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for source parameters . since early gw detections",
    "will likely be low - snr , a full treatment of the sky localization will be critical when matching the gw event to an em counterpart both ( 1 ) to ensure high - probability regions are not falsely excluded from consideration and ( 2 ) to minimize the number of false - positive transients that must be dealt with .",
    "later , should event rates reach tens per year as predicted , the ease of finding counterparts will be directly related to how well gw networks can localize events . in this paper",
    "we use markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques to map the full pdf of the sky location where an event may have occurred . specifically , we examine sky localization for non - spinning ns ",
    "ns populations for advanced gw detector networks , including ligo ( the two 4 km sites situated at hanford and livingston ) , virgo , lcgt , and ligo - australia . for conciseness , we restrict our analysis here to ns ",
    "ns binaries , results for ns  bh binaries being similar . for networks comprising",
    "the initial versions of ligo and virgo detectors , several works ( e.g. , @xcite ) have addressed sky localization using mcmc techniques for single ns ",
    "ns and spin - precessing ns ",
    "bh systems .",
    "after the present article was submitted , a similar mcmc study was performed by  @xcite .",
    "they focus on the addition of ligo australia , and find consistent results to ours .",
    "we follow similar techniques to those developed in  n10 , which focuses on distance determination using advanced gw detector networks for sources with known em counterparts .",
    "in contrast to n10 , here we instead ask how well a network of ground - based gw detectors can determine the sky positions of previously unknown compact binary sources , a central question when planning complementary em observations for counterparts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] outlines the extraction of sky position from the gws emitted by inspiraling binaries .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] discusses our sky - localization results for individual systems and populations of ns ",
    "ns binaries .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] presents our conclusions .",
    "based on optimal matched filtering ( @xcite ) , we extract the sky position @xmath18 for each ns  ns binary using knowledge of the expected gw waveform , where @xmath19 is the vector pointing to a binary on the sky ( the waves therefore propagate to the earth along @xmath20 ) .",
    "the colatitude @xmath21 and longitude @xmath22 are related to the declination @xmath23 and right ascension @xmath24 , by @xmath25 and @xmath26gast respectively , where gast is greenwich apparent sidereal time .",
    "we use only the early inspiral portion of the waveform , which for low mass systems provides most of the signal for advanced detectors @xcite and is modeled accurately using post - newtonian ( pn ) expansions in general relativity .",
    "specifically , we use the non - spinning restricted 2pn waveform in the frequency domain for the two gw polarizations @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; see equations .",
    "( 12)(14 ) in n10 .",
    "the detector antenna functions depend on @xmath18 and the binary s polarization angle .",
    "the overall amplitude of the gw waveform encodes the source s orientation , sky location , luminosity distance and redshifted chirp mass ( see discussion in n10 ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the inspiral waveform ends abruptly prior to merger at the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "the time of flight from source at direction @xmath18 to detector at location @xmath29 involves the scalar product @xmath30 , and differences in time of flight among detectors in the network dominate sky localization .    in order to infer the sky position @xmath31",
    ", we explicitly map out the posterior pdf for all source parameters ( including chirp mass , orientation , etc . )",
    "given an observed data stream at a detector , using mcmc .",
    "the metropolis ",
    "hastings mcmc algorithm used is based on a generic version of cosmomc , described in @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume gaussian , stationary , and zero - mean noise that is independent and uncorrelated between detectors .",
    "we take the anticipated noise sensitivity curve for a single advanced ligo detector , given in @xcite , for broadband tuning , to be representative of all our detectors , imposing a low - frequency cut off of 10 hz .",
    "since we trigger detections off the _ expected _ and not the _ observed _ snr , we do not incorporate selection effects into our analysis .",
    "therefore , we take prior distributions in all source parameters to be flat over the region of sample space where the binary is detectable at an expected network snr = 3.5 .",
    "the expected network snr is defined as the root sum square of the expected individual detector snrs . for each mcmc simulation ,",
    "we derive solid angle areas over @xmath32 for 68@xmath1 , 95@xmath1 , and 99@xmath1 confidence regions .",
    "the selection of our `` detected '' binaries is central to the derivation of representative sky localization statistics for binary populations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we simulate a million binaries out to @xmath33 , assuming a constant comoving volume density in a @xmath34cdm universe @xcite , and with random binary sky positions and orientations .",
    "each ns has a physical mass of @xmath35 .",
    "we consider two plausible scenarios where each binary in the total population is selected : ( 1 ) if its expected network snr is greater than a network threshold of 8.5 ( case i ) and ( 2 ) if each expected snr at both ligo hanford and ligo livingston has a value of 6 or higher and if the expected network snr is above 12 ( case ii ) .",
    "we choose to threshold off the ligo detectors , as opposed to any other two detectors , only as a representative example out of all other possible coincident threshold scenarios .",
    "case i uses a _ network _",
    "thresholding criterion similar to that used in n10 and @xcite .",
    "we first examine sky localization for ns ",
    "ns binaries taken at random from our case i or case ii detected samples . for each binary",
    "we assign a unique noise realization to each detector , which we keep constant when adding and subtracting detectors to a network .",
    "this enables a meaningful comparison between the performance of different networks .",
    "we consider networks comprising combinations of ligo , virgo , lau , and lcgt .    in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , we find elliptically shaped errors for the majority of our examined ns  ns binaries .",
    "this is unsurprising given that sky localization reconstruction is dominated by differing gw arrival times at each detector rather than the direction - dependent antenna functions in the gw amplitude .",
    "for the three - element ligo  virgo network , sources located toward the detector plane produce elongated error ellipses and have relatively poor angular resolution .",
    "however , the error ellipse significantly decreases in size as additional detectors are added to the network .",
    "the inclusion of lau is particularly favorable and breaks the ligo ",
    "virgo(lcgt ) degenerate plane . as a representative example ,",
    "figure  [ fig : highsnrellipse ] shows a relatively high snr gw signal for a ns ",
    "ns binary located at 180 mpc with an inclination angle of @xmath36 and a sky location of @xmath37 .",
    "the expected snrs at ligo hanford , ligo livingston , virgo , lau , and lcgt are 6.7 , 7.8 , 12.4 , 10.5 , and 8.9 , respectively .",
    "the specific orientation and shape of the ellipse are dependent upon the sky position and orientation , and noise realization .",
    "[ fig : lowsnrellipse ]    however , for a handful of events near threshold , we find that sky error areas are considerably non - ellipsoidal and exhibit multimodal distributions , in particular with networks that do not include lau . as expected , their errors are not centered on the source s true sky position and we find that @xmath38 of our selected binaries have true positions that lie outside the 95@xmath1 confidence region .",
    "analyses such as  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite can not reproduce such features due to limiting assumptions implicit in timing and fisher information methods . figure  [ fig : lowsnrellipse ] shows an example of a low - snr ns ",
    "ns binary located at 567 mpc with an inclination angle of @xmath39 and a sky location of @xmath40 .",
    "the expected snrs at ligo hanford , ligo livingston , virgo , lau , and lcgt are 5.4 , 6.2 , 3.1 , 5.6 , and 3.0 , respectively .",
    "we find that error areas typically decrease by a factor of 45 by including lau in the network .",
    "for particularly weak signals , multimodal peaks and statistical biases occur because multiple likelihood peaks for different values of the gw waveform s amplitude become indistinguishable from each other due to the uncertainties in the signal s time of arrival at each detector .",
    "we now examine cumulative distribution in sky errors for ensembles of gw ns  ns events using different detector networks .",
    "we randomly choose events from our samples of detected ns ",
    "ns binaries using the two different selection criteria detailed in section  [ sec : detbin ] .      in case",
    "i we set a total gw detector network threshold of 8.5 , which implies an _ approximate _ snr threshold per detector of @xmath41 for each of the five detectors . as a first approximation",
    ", we estimate a detectable range of events within the maximum network capability : each detector in the five - detector network has a `` weighted geometric average '' ( optimal ) range of about @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for ns ",
    "ns events .",
    "the geometric average statistic used here is a weighted angular average over all sky positions and orientations , which is a factor of @xmath44 smaller than the optimal range for a face - on binary that is located directly above the detector ( see @xcite ) .    in order to obtain detection event rates ,",
    "we follow the approach given in  @xcite where detection ranges are derived by thresholding off a single ligo snr of @xmath45 . as",
    "the noise in reality is non - gaussian and non - stationary , @xcite use the range for a single detector to represent the network of ligo  virgo detectors in order to achieve desired false alarm rates . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we apply the same argument to our analysis : a five - detector network will have an approximate threshold per detector of @xmath46 , and hence a geometric average ( optimal ) range of about @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for ns ",
