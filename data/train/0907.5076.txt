    "we are now ready to introduce the general _ discrete copolymer model _ , as the probability law @xmath75 for the sequence @xmath76 defined by @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath14 and @xmath79 is a sequence of real numbers ( a  typical realization of an i.i.d .",

    "note that the new model ( [ eq : taumodel ] ) only describes the sequence of signs @xmath76 , while the _ simple random walk model _ ( [ eq : srwmodel ] ) records the full trajectory @xmath10 .",
    "however , once we project the probability law ( [ eq : srwmodel ] ) on the variables @xmath83 , it is easy to check that the simple random walk model becomes a particular case of ( [ eq : taumodel ] ) and its partition function ( [ eq : srwz ] ) coincides with the general one given by ( [ eq : discz ] ) , provided we choose @xmath84 as the law of the first return to zero of the simple random walk [ corresponding to @xmath85 ; see ( [ eq : tausrw ] ) and ( [ eq : k ] ) ] . as a matter of fact , since we require that @xmath86 for all large @xmath87 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) ] , strictly speaking the case of the simple random walk is not covered .",

    "means that the @xmath104th monomer of the chain lies above ( resp .",
    ", below ) the interface . to reinforce the intuition , we will sometimes describe the model in terms of full trajectories , like in the simple random walk case .",
    "[ rem : svf ] we refer to @xcite for a full account on slowly varying functions . here",

    "the most basic example of a slowly varying function is any positive measurable function that converges to a positive constant at infinity ( in this case , we say that the slowly varying function is trivial ) .",
    "other important examples are positive measurable functions which behave asymptotically like the power of a logarithm , that is , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "this work focuses on the properties of the free energy of the discrete copolymer , defined by @xmath113 .\\ ] ] the existence of such a limit follows by a standard argument , see , for example , @xcite , chapter 4 , where it is also proven that for every @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath114 equations ( [ eq : fe - qa ] ) and ( [ eq : fe - q ] ) are telling us that the limit in ( [ eq : fe - q ] ) does not depend on the ( typical ) realization of @xmath33 .",
    "nonetheless , it is worthwhile to stress that it does depend on @xmath34 , that is , on the law of @xmath94 , as well as on the renewal process on which the model is built , namely on the inter - arrival law @xmath82 .",
    "this should be kept in mind , even if we omit @xmath34 and @xmath82 from the notation @xmath115 .",
    "an elementary , but crucial observation is @xmath116 this follows simply by restricting the expectation in ( [ eq : discz ] ) to the event @xmath117 , on which we have @xmath118 , hence we obtain @xmath119 and it suffices to observe that @xmath120 vanishes as @xmath36 , thanks to ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "notice that the event @xmath117 corresponds to the set of trajectories that never visit the lower half plane , therefore the right - hand side of ( [ eq : ebutc ] ) may be viewed as the contribution to the free energy given by these trajectories .",
    "based on this observation , it is customary to say that @xmath121 ( _ delocalized regime _ ) if @xmath122 , while @xmath123 ( _ localized regime _ ) if @xmath124 ( see also figure [ fig : phasediag ] and its caption ) .",

    "we have the following theorem .",
    "[ th : phasediag ] if we set @xmath129 , then @xmath130 and the function @xmath131 $ ] is strictly increasing and continuous as long as it is finite .",

    "we also point out that a numerical study of the critical line in the simple random walk case ( @xmath147 ) has been performed in @xcite , while the critical point of a simplified copolymer model , originally introduced in @xcite , has been obtained in @xcite .    the focus on the behavior of the _ critical line _",
    "@xmath148 for @xmath98 small has a reason , that is , at the heart of this paper : our aim is to study the free energy @xmath149 of discrete copolymer models in the _ weak coupling limit _ , that is , when @xmath98 and @xmath99 are small .",
    "we will show that the behavior of @xmath149 in this regime is captured by the exponent @xmath2 appearing in ( [ eq : k ] ) , independently of the finer details of the inter - arrival law @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , we prove that @xmath150 exists and that it depends only on @xmath2 . in order to state these results",
    "precisely , we need to introduce a class of copolymer models in the continuum : in a suitable sense , they capture the limit of discrete copolymer models as @xmath151 .",

    "therefore , by looking at the positivity of @xmath162 , one can define also for the brownian copolymer model the localized and delocalized regimes , that are separated by the critical line @xmath163 .",
    "now a real novelty comes into the game : the scaling properties of the two brownian motions yield easily that for every @xmath109 @xmath164 in particular , the critical line is a straight line : @xmath165 , for every @xmath166 , with @xmath167    we are now ready to state the main result in @xcite .",

    "in fact , since brownian motion is the scaling limit of many discrete processes , it is natural to guess that theorem [ th : bdh ] should hold for a large class of discrete copolymer models and for a vast choice of charge distributions ( remaining of course in the domain of attraction of the gaussian law and adding some technical assumptions ) . this would show that the brownian copolymer model has indeed a _ universal _ character .",
    "in fact , theorem [ th : bdh ] has been generalized in @xcite to a large class of disorder random variables ( including all bounded random variables ) .",
    "a further generalization has been obtained in @xcite , in the case when , added to the copolymer interaction , there is also a _ pinning _ interaction at the interface , that is , an energy reward in touching the interface .",
    "we stress , however , that these generalizations are always for the copolymer model built over the simple random walk : going beyond the simple random walk case appears indeed to be a very delicate ( albeit natural ) step .",
    "the main result of this paper is that theorem [ th : bdh ] can be generalized to any discrete @xmath2-copolymer model with @xmath171 and to any disorder distribution satisfying ( [ eq : mgo ] ) and ( [ eq : gonorm ] ) ( see theorem [ th : main ] below ) . for @xmath172 ,",
    "the scaling limit is precisely the brownian copolymer model ( [ eq : zbrownian ] ) , like in the simple random walk case , while for @xmath173 the continuum copolymer model is defined in the next subsection .",
    "we stress from now that the scaling limit _ depends only on @xmath2 _ : in particular , there is no dependence on the slowly varying function @xmath105 appearing in ( [ eq : k ] ) and no dependence on @xmath174 for any finite @xmath104 .",
    "let us start by recalling that , for , _ the square of @xmath175-dimensional bessel process _",

    "it is easily checked using it s formula that for @xmath172 ( i.e. , @xmath185 ) the process @xmath183 has the same law as the absolute value of brownian motion on @xmath186 . since to define the brownian copolymer model ( [ eq : zbrownian ] ) we have used the full brownian motion process , not only its absolute value , we need a modification of the bessel process in which each excursion from zero may be either positive or negative , with the sign chosen _ by fair coin tossing_. such a process , that we denote by @xmath187 , has been considered in the literature , for example , in @xcite , and is called _",

    "we denote by @xmath9 its law .",

    "in particular , the critical line close to the origin is , to leading order , a straight line of slope  @xmath228 .",
    "it is therefore clear that computing @xmath228 or , at least , being able of improving the known bounds on @xmath228 would mean a substantial progress in understanding the phase transition in this model .",
    "note that , of course , given ( [ eq : mainslope ] ) , the bounds in ( [ eq : slopebounds ] ) are actually bounds on @xmath228 ( and they represent the state of the art on this important issue , to the the authors knowledge ) .",

    "_ in this step , we replace the boltzmann factor by a new , _ coarser _ one , which does not depend on the _ short _ excursions of the renewal process ( in the sense that these excursions inherit the sign of a neighbor long gap ) .",

    "switching to gaussian charges . _",
    "the original approach exploits the well known , and highly nontrivial , coupling result due to komls , major and tusndy @xcite .",
    "we take instead a more direct , and more elementary , approach . in doing so , we get rid of any assumption , beyond local exponential integrability , on the disorder .",

    "this is probably the crucial step .",
    "the original approach exploits heavily the underlying simple random walk and the exact formulas available for such a process .",
    "our approach necessarily sticks to the renewal process and , in a sense , the point is showing that suitable local limit theorems ( crucial here are results by doney @xcite ) suffice to perform this step .",
    "there is , however , another issue that makes our general case different from the simple random walk case .",
    "in fact this step , in the original approach , is based on showing that a suitable radon  nikodym derivative , comparing the renewal process and the regenerative set , is uniformly bounded . in our general set - up ,",
    "this radon  nikodym derivative is not bounded and a more careful estimate has to be carried out .",
    "_ inverse coarse graining of the regenerative set .",
    "_ we are now left with a model based on the regenerative set , but depending only on the _ large _ excursions .",
    "we have therefore to show that putting back the dependence on the small excursions does not modify substantially the quantity we are dealing with .",
    "this is parallel to the first step : it involves estimates that are different from the ones in the original approach , because we are sticking to the regenerative set formulation and because @xmath2 is not necessarily equal to @xmath8 , but the difference is , essentially , just technical .",
    "let us finally mention that our choice of focusing on discrete copolymer models built over renewal processes leaves out another possible ( and perhaps more natural ) generalization of the simple random walk copolymer model ( [ eq : srwmodel ] ) : namely , the one obtained by replacing the simple random walk with a more general random walk . a general random walk crosses the interface without necessarily touching it , therefore the associated point process is a markov renewal process @xcite , because one has to carry along not only the switching - sign times , but also the height of the walk at these times ( sometimes called the _ overshoot _ ) .",
    "this is definitely an interesting and nontrivial problem that goes in a direction which is complementary to the one we have taken .",
    "however two remarks are in order :    1 .",
    "symmetric random walks with i.i.d .",
    "increments in @xmath238 touch the interface when they cross it , hence , they are covered by our analysis : their weak coupling limit is the continuum @xmath8-copolymer , because @xmath239 ( e.g. , @xcite , appendix a.5 ) .",
    "while one definitely expects an analog of theorem [ th : main ] to hold for _ rather general _ random walks with increments in the domain of attraction of the normal law ( with the continuum @xmath8-copolymer as weak coupling limit ) , it is less clear what to expect when the increments of the walk are in the domain of attraction of a non - gaussian stable law . in our view , working with generalized copolymer models has , in any case , a considerable flexibility with respect to focusing on the random walk set - up .",
    "in this section , we prove the existence of the continuum free energy @xmath240 , that is , we prove theorem [ th : existence ] . in section [ sec : modified ] , we define a modified partition function , to which kingman s super - additive ergodic theorem can be applied , and then in section [ sec : existence_proof ] , we show that this modified partition function yields the same free energy as the original one . before starting with the proof , in section [ sec : redefine ] we redefine the partition function @xmath241 more directly in terms of the @xmath2-stable regenerative set @xmath204 , whose basic properties",

    "so let us reintroduce @xmath244 more explicitly , in terms of the random set @xmath204 [ cf .",
