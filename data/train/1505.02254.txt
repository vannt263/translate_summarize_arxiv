    "seems to follow a distinct pattern .",
    "starting from a random surface with some small initial roughness @xmath30 , the roughness begins to grow almost exponentially , but at some time @xmath31 this growth slows down and later on crosses over to a stationary regime where it oscillates about its average ( _ saturation _ ) value @xmath32 ( see fig .",
