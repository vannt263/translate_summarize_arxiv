    "when hadronic cosmic rays interact with a matter target locally at the cosmic ray acceleration site , neutral particles like gamma - rays and neutrinos are produced via pion- and kaon decay from the interaction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . in astrophysical environments , it is usually sufficient to include the contribution from pions and neglect the kaons as well as any contribution from charmed particles .",
    "the main reason is the low target density , which does not allow the pions to interact before they decay .",
    "thus , the much more frequent process of pion decay usually dominates the neutrino spectrum .",
    "situations of extreme environment can change that , as can be seen at the example of gamma - ray bursts , discussed in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in general , proton - proton and proton - photon interactions produce neutrinos in astrophysical environments . here , we focus on proton - proton interactions due to the high matter density in stellar wind environments which should dominate the total optical depth for hadronic interactions .",
    "an additional reason is the very high energy threshold for neutrino - production via proton - photon interactions , see e.g.  @xcite for a detailed discussion . with maximum energies around some tev",
    ", it is not expected to have a significant contribution . the neutrino spectrum from charged pion - decay",
    "is given as @xmath13 here , the integration is performed in @xmath14 .",
    "functions are the total inclusive proton - proton cross - section @xmath15 , the number of protons per unit area and energy at the source @xmath16 and the distribution of neutrino production from a single interaction of a proton at energy @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the factor @xmath19 takes into account the relative contribution of protons in the interval @xmath20 . an analytic approximation derived from numerical interaction models",
    "can be found in @xcite and will be used here .",
    "neutrinos are produced both directly from the charged pion decay , @xmath21 , and from the muon decay , @xmath22 .",
    "each of the three neutrino fluxes receives approximately the same amount of total energy from the pion .",
    "thus , on total , @xmath23 of the energy is going into the neutrinos .",
    "once produced , neutrinos propagate straight without further interaction , and the only thing which needs to be taken into account is their oscillation .",
    "a ratio of @xmath24 is expected on average at such long distances , when starting with the pion - induced ratio of @xmath25 at the source .    the uncertainties of the calculation from astrophysics , in particular the unknown cosmic ray flux at the source , but also the target density , dominate the total uncertainties of the calculation .",
    "in this context , ingredients from particle physics ( i.e.  neutrino distribution function and proton - proton cross - section ) are sufficiently well - known . in this paper ,",
    "gamma - ray observations are used to constrain the astrophysical parameter space .",
    "the spectral behaviour of the neutrinos and photons follows the cosmic ray spectrum directly above a threshold energy of @xmath5  mev and up to a maximum energy of about @xmath26 for neutrinos and @xmath27th for photons of the maximum cosmic ray energy .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration indicates cosmic ray spectra at the source of @xmath28 , see e.g.  @xcite for a summary . for simplicity",
    ", an @xmath7 spectral behaviour is used here , with a cosmic ray maximum energy of 100  tev .",
    "a binary system is described via its mass loss rates @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and wind velocities @xmath31 .",
    "the colliding winds provide a total power of @xmath32 and it is expected that parts of this power is going into the acceleration of cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays are therefore limited in their total luminosity @xmath33 by the energy available from the total wind power @xmath34 : total wind power : @xmath35 with @xmath36 . for the seven most interesting systems , among them @xmath10  car , wr140 and wr147 , parameters are listed in table [ wind_parameters : tab ] .      1 .   * wind luminosity : * under the assumption that a fixed budget of the total wind velocity , @xmath37 , the neutrino flux scales with this variable , @xmath38 .",
    "* hydrogen density : * the fraction of protons interacting in the gas depends linearly on the target density assuming optical depths less than 1 , which is a reasonable assumption .",
    "therefore , neutrino production from a fixed cosmic ray flux depends on the hydrogen density @xmath39 , where all hydrogen species ( h - i , h - ii and h@xmath40 are counted ) : @xmath41 .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of helium in the wind would further increase the signal .",
    "the flux would scale up by a factor @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the local helium density . as uncertainties on the fraction of helium at the source are rather large , this additional contribution is neglected at this point .",
    "* distance to the source : * the flux observed at earth then scales with one over the distance from the source squared : @xmath44 .",
    "thus , on total , the neutrino flux scales with the variable @xmath45 the number of @xmath46 given in the above equation represents the value for @xmath10-car with the input - parameters as indicated . in this case , the expected neutrino flux can be derived directly from the measurements of the high - energy gamma - ray component @xcite .",
    "wind parameters for wr11 , wr137 , wr140 , wr146 and wr147 are taken from @xcite , who also provide restrictive limits to the gamma - ray flux from measurements with the _ fermi _ satellite . in this paper , these limits are used to normalise the photon and neutrinos fluxes , a procedure that leads to the prediction of an upper limit to the density in the source @xmath47 : as all parameters are fixed in the calculation according to table [ wind_parameters : tab ] , the density needs to be reduced with respect to the density in @xmath10 carinae to obey the limits .",
    "figure [ eta_carinae_numu ] shows the resulting neutrino fluxes .",
    "as described above , the upper limit from observations to the distance of the source is used in the calculations , resulting in a conservative estimate of the fluxes .",
    "then , the density is estimated in an optimistic fashion , choosing a value close to the limit for gamma - ray emission given in @xcite .",
    "figure [ eta_carinae_numu ] shows that potential cwb neutrino sources range from flux levels of @xmath48  gev/(@xmath49  s  sr ) . for one year of operation",
    ", the sensitivity of the icecube between @xmath50  tev and @xmath12  tev is at a level of @xmath51  gev/(@xmath49  s  sr ) for the first three years of operation , depending on the exact declination of the source @xcite .",
    "icecube is sensitive to northern hemisphere sources at these energies , i.e.  to wr137 , wr140 , wr146 and wr147 .",
    "sources in the southern hemisphere , i.e.  wr11 , eta carinae and the arches cluster , are interesting for the operating antares telescope , but in particular for the km3net observatory with its improved sensitivity . from the first icecube results @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that a detection of neutrinos from cwbs can not be accommodated right now .",
    "also , the detected , diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos can not arise from these sources , as it persists up to pev energies , so much higher than expected for cwbs , where the maximum neutrino energy would rather be in the gev - tev range , assuming that neutrinos receive approximately @xmath26th of the initial cosmic ray energy , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the central question is now how the detection probability could be enhanced when concerning cwbs .",
    "apart from considering the obvious analysis strategies like searching for individual point sources or stacking the brightest sources , it is most important to exploit the signal at low energies as efficiently as possible . within icecube , the deepcore array enlarges the effective area at energies around @xmath52  gev by a factor of larger than @xmath53 @xcite . in the future , the low - energy icecube extension pingu will improve the sensitivity at gev energies even further @xcite .",
    "what could be exploited in this context is the probability _ minimum _ for @xmath54 oscillations at @xmath55  gev , i.e.  @xmath56  gev@xmath57 , see @xcite and references therein . in a purely theoretical view ,",
    "the atmospheric muon neutrino flux is reduced to zero at these energies .",
    "this would , again theoretically , reduce the background to zero , such that a single signal event would become significant .",
    "of course , limited energy resolution and other uncertainties connected to the detection of gev neutrinos will make such a detection strategy much more complicated .",
    "one other important issue is the precise estimate of the atmospheric neutrino flux at gev energies .",
    "the use of corsika low - energy extensions ( e.g.  fluka ) make it possible to model the atmospheric flux with up - to - date fits of the measured cosmic ray flux at earth and current cross sections .",
    "this work is ongoing and it will provide a tool in the future to reduce the uncertainties from the theoretical side to a minimum , but certainly not to zero .    while the above uncertainties make a detection of a gev - signal from astrophysical sources difficult , it could still be feasible .",
    "this option should be considered for future detection arrays like pingu , as it may be the only chance to see neutrinos from cosmic ray sources with maximum energies smaller than some tev .",
    "one advantage could be that searches for these sources do not concern the entire sky , but can be limited to the region where the source / the sources are located , thus reducing the background to a minimum .    to summarise , as of _ today _ , the detection of neutrinos from cwbs with icecube or antares is rather unlikely due to a relatively low flux in combination with a low maximum energy . with the first detection of an astrophysical signal , high - energy neutrino astrophysics has just begun .",
    "therefore , for the _ future _ , considering the potential of low - energy extensions like pingu or orca , cwbs should be certainly be considered as interesting neutrino sources , having the potential to reveal both acceleration properties as well as information about the local hydrogen density .",
    "i would like to thank john black , ralf kissmann , horst fichtner and klaus scherer for valuable discussions on this topic before , during and after this workshop .",
    "in addition , thanks to the two anonymous referees for providing constructive and valuable comments .",
    "this work was partially supported by the dfg project be3714/4 - 1 , the aspera project _ a concerted r&d program for low energy neutrino detectors _ and the research department of plasmas with complex interactions ( bochum ) ."
