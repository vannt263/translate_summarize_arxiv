    "the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect in metallic spin valves systems@xcite has led to substantial research in the field of spintronics due to the possible applications including read heads in hard disks , storage elements in magnetic random access memory ( mram ) , and sensors . an effective method for writing information into the elements",
    "is necessary for the application as storage elements in mram . in particular , one has to be able to change the magnetic orientation of the ferromagnetic leads relative to each other .",
    "one promising approach is the current induced switching proposed by slonczewski @xcite and by berger.@xcite a current is driven through the junction and becomes spin polarized in one ferromagnetic lead .",
    "this polarization is conserved going through the spacer layer . when the corresponding angular momentum of the polarized current is not exactly aligned to the magnetization of the second ferromagnetic lead , the electrons precess around the magnetic moment of the second magnetic layer .",
    "in turn this precession leads to a torque acting on this magnetization forcing it to rotate . when the current is large enough",
    ", the magnetic orientation in the second layer can be switched .",
    "there is also a torque acting on the first ferromagnetic layer , but this layer is magnetically pinned .    in this paper",
    "we present an _ ab initio _ calculation of the spin - transfer torque using a multiple scattering green s function scheme .",
    "in particular , the non - equilibrium spin density is calculated using the steady state keldysh approach ( see sec .  [ keldysh ] ) .",
    "this spin density is used to calculate the torque acting on the ferromagnetic layer ( see sec .",
    "[ torque ] ) .",
    "we conclude by testing our approach through an application to a co / cu / co system , which has been studied by other authors.@xcite",
    "the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach is based on dividing the junction into three regions ( see fig .  [ fig_sketch ] ) : two semi - infinite unperturbed leads left ( l ) and right ( r ) and a middle ( m ) region ( or scattering region ) .",
    "this division allows a description of the effect on the middle region of the semi - inifinite leads each having a different chemical potential .",
    "the effect on the middle region can be written in terms of a self - energy of the left lead @xmath0 given by the coupling from the middle to the left lead and back @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the surface green s function of the isolated semi - infinite left lead and @xmath3 describes the coupling of the left lead to the middle region . in an analogous way one defines the self - energy of the right lead @xmath4 .",
    "these self - energies can be interpreted as fluxes of incoming and outgoing electrons at the connection between leads and middle region.@xcite using the self - energy of the left and right lead one can express the spin density matrix in the middle region @xmath5 g_{m , c}^\\dagger\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the green s function of region m coupled ( c ) to the semi - infinite leads and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the the distribution functions of the left and right lead.@xcite all quantities in eq .",
    "[ sigma_dist ] are energy dependent .",
    "the self - energy can be used to relate the coupled ( c ) and isolated ( i ) green s functions of the middle region via a dyson equation @xmath9 this equation is based on the assumption that the self - energies can be added , which is true if the leads are well separated and their interaction can be neglected .",
    "our approach for calculating the self - energy with a ( kkr ) multiple scattering scheme is based on the approach due to henk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , following the work by pendry _",
    "_ @xcite here we sketch this idea and highlight the basic assumptions which are necessary .    for the calculation of the self - energy using eq .",
    "( [ def_sigma ] ) , one needs to know the coupling between the lead and the middle region .",
    "in contrast to , _",
    "e.g. _ , tight binding approaches@xcite this coupling is not directly accessible within the kkr scheme because one calculates the green s function of a system by a dyson equation .",
    "hence to obtain the coupling , one has to invert the green s function .",
    "the alternate approach we use is to introduce decoupling potentials @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ fig_sketch ] bottom ) which decouple the middle region from the leads using finite barriers . in the following",
    "we show that one can define a self - energy using @xmath12 and the green s function @xmath13 of the decoupled system .",
    "the green s functions of the infinite systems ( coupled and decoupled ) can be related by the dyson equation @xmath14 inserting this equation once in itself and using the assumptions ( written schematically ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 one can identify the self - energies by comparing the result to eqs .",
    "( [ def_sigma ] ) and ( [ dyson_keld ] ) @xmath17 assumptions ( [ assum1 ] ) and ( [ assum2 ] ) are necessary because @xmath10 and @xmath11 are local potentials whereas @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ def_sigma ] ) is a coupling .",
    "assumption ( [ assum1 ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath19 which one assures by choosing an appropriately high @xmath12 .",
    "assumption ( [ assum2 ] ) is that the self - energies of the right and left lead can be added .",
    "this is fulfilled if the leads are well separated because the elements of @xmath13 relating the left and the right lead decay exponentially with respect to the thickness of the decoupling potential .    by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ def_sigma ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) the role of @xmath13 is the role of the surface green s function of the isolated leads .",
    "therefore , one can also set the whole middle region to the potential @xmath12 when calculating @xmath13 . for details of the implementation using the kkr basis set",
    "see ref .  .",
    "for the present work , we generalize the method to non - collinear magnetizations based on ref .  .",
    "from the non - equilibrium green s function for a non - collinear magnetization described in the previous section , it is straightforward to compute the spin - tranfer torque . in linear response , the spin torque @xmath20 per current @xmath21 on layer @xmath22 can be expressed by ( see haney _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the matrix elements of the exchange field along the magnetization axis of the layer @xmath22 expanded into spherical harmonics with @xmath25 being the angular momentum .",
    "@xmath26 is the magnetic moment of the electrons contributing to the transport and is calculated from the non - equilibrium spin density matrix at the fermi level @xmath27 using eq .",
    "( [ sigma_dist ] ) @xmath28 taking into account that the electronic states at @xmath27 are occupied only in one lead .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath29 is calculated by @xmath30 \\ , \\ ] ] where the trace is over the spin index and the basis set expansion .",
    "due to the in - plane translational invariance of the junctions one can label the states by the wave vector @xmath31 and all quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_den ] ) and ( [ eq_trans ] ) depend on @xmath31 . to get the total values one has to integrate over the 2d brillouin zone .",
    "in this section we test our approach by applying it to a co / cu / co system . in particular",
    ", we consider the dependence of the torque on the angle between the two magnetizations of the ferromagnetic leads .",
    "for this purpose , we use the same structure used in ref .   consisting of a semi - infinite co , 9 monolayers cu , 15 monolayers co , and semi - infinite cu .",
    "the lattice constant is 0.361  nm .",
    "[ fig_conduct ] shows the dependence of the conductance @xmath33 on the relative angle @xmath34 between the magnetizations of the co layers .",
    "we find excellent agreement with ref .   and",
    "a gmr ratio @xmath35 .    fig .",
    "[ fig_torque ] shows the in - plane torque @xmath36 and the out - of - plane torque @xmath37 as a function of the angle @xmath34 for two different @xmath31 point samples .",
    "the out - of - plane torque has two contributions : one from the right going states that are occupied and have no left going counterparts , and the other from states below both chemical potentials in which both left and right going states are occupied .",
    "the latter contribution requires integration over energy as well as parallel wave vector .",
    "however , the usage of a complex energy contour makes it easier to converge . for the former contribution one can not use a complex energy because only right going states are occupied .",
    "therefore , to test our method against previous calculations and to test the k - point convergence , we consider only this contribution to the out - of - plane torque in the following .",
    "the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath34 is the same for both @xmath31 samplings and is in good agreement to ref .  .",
    "in contrast , @xmath37 shows rapid oscillations as a function of @xmath34 for the @xmath31 sampling using 40 000 @xmath31 points .",
    "a similar dependence was observed in ref .  .",
    "however , a significantly larger @xmath31 point sample leads to an almost smooth dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath34 .    due to the drastic change in @xmath37 from increasing the number of @xmath31 points",
    ", we test the convergence of the in - plane torque @xmath36 and the out - of - plane torque @xmath37 for a fixed angle @xmath38 as a function of the number of @xmath31 points ( see fig .  [ fig_conv ] ) .",
    "for @xmath36 the convergence is fast and a relatively low number of @xmath31 points is sufficient . on the other hand",
    "@xmath37 is very sensitive to the number of @xmath31 points and a large number is necessary to get convergence .",
    "the slow convergence results from the presence of short period oscillations at the corners of the 2d brillouin zone which require a very fine mesh .",
    "therefore , the rapid oscillations in @xmath37 as a function of angle found in ref .   disappear for fully converged @xmath31 point samples .",
    "we present a method to calculate the spin - transfer torque within a screened kkr scheme by calculating the non - equilibrium spin density using the steady state keldysh approach .",
    "the in - plane torque in the co / cu / co junctions is robust with respect to the @xmath31 point sampling but the out - of - plane torque converges slowly with respect to the number of @xmath31 points .",
    "the reason is that there are short period oscillations at the edges of the 2d brillouin zone .",
    "these oscillation require a very fine @xmath31 point mesh to get the correct value for the integral .",
    "then both components of the torque are a smooth function of the angle but with maxima at different angles .",
