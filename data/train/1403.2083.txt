    "intro a remarkable phenomenon quite ubiquitous in nature is that of collective synchronization , in which a large population of coupled oscillators spontaneously synchronizes to oscillate at a common frequency , despite each constituent having a different natural frequency of oscillation @xcite .",
    "one witnesses such a spectacular cooperative effect in many physical and biological systems over length and time scales that span several orders of magnitude . some common examples are metabolic synchrony in yeast cell suspensions @xcite , synchronized firings of cardiac pacemaker cells @xcite , flashing in unison by groups of fireflies @xcite , voltage oscillations at a common frequency in an array of current - biased josephson junctions @xcite , phase synchronization in electrical power distribution networks @xcite , rhythmic applause @xcite , animal flocking behavior @xcite",
    "; see @xcite for a survey .",
    "the kuramoto model provides a simple theoretical framework to study how synchronization may emerge spontaneously in the dynamics of a many - body interacting system @xcite .",
    "the model comprises globally - coupled oscillators of distributed natural frequencies that are interacting via a mean - field coupling through the sine of their phase differences , with the phases following a first - order dynamics in time . over the years",
    ", many aspects of the model , including applications cutting across disciplines , from physical and biological to even social modelling , have been considered in the literature @xcite .    an early motivation behind studying the kuramoto model was to explain the spectacular phenomenon of spontaneous synchronization among fireflies : in parts of south - east asia , thousands of male fireflies gather in trees at night and flash on and off in unison .",
    "in this respect , focussing on fireflies of a particular species ( the _ pteroptyx mallacae _ ) , a study due to ermentrout revealed that the approach to synchronization from an initially unsynchronized state is faster in the kuramoto setting than in reality @xcite .",
    "ermentrout proposed a route to reconciliation by elevating the first - order dynamics of the kuramoto model to the level of second - order dynamics . including also a gaussian noise term that accounts for the stochastic fluctuations of the natural frequencies in time @xcite , one arrives at a generalized kuramoto model including inertia and noise , in which oscillator phases have a second - order dynamics in time @xcite .",
    "one can prove that the resulting dynamics leads to a nonequilibrium stationary state ( ness ) at long times @xcite .",
    "study of nesss is an active area of research of modern day statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "such states are characterized by a violation of detailed balance leading to a net non - zero probability current around a closed loop in the configuration space .",
    "one of the primary challenges in this field is to formulate a tractable framework to analyze nonequilibrium systems on a common footing , similar to the one due to gibbs and boltzmann that has been established for equilibrium systems @xcite .    in a different context than that of coupled oscillators",
    ", the dynamics of the generalized kuramoto model also describes a long - range interacting system of particles moving on a unit circle under the influence of a set of external drive in the form of a quenched external torque acting on the individual particles , in the presence of noise . with the noise , but without the external torques , the resulting model is the so - called brownian mean - field ( bmf ) model @xcite , introduced as a generalization of the celebrated hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model that serves as a prototype to study statics and dynamics of long - range interacting systems @xcite . in recent years , there has been a surge in interest in studies of systems with long - range interactions . in these systems ,",
    "the inter - particle potential in @xmath0 dimensions decays at large separation @xmath1 as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "examples are gravitational systems @xcite , plasmas @xcite , two - dimensional hydrodynamics @xcite , charged and dipolar systems @xcite , etc . unlike systems with short - range interactions , long - range interacting systems are generically non - additive , implying that dividing the system into macroscopic subsystems and summing over their thermodynamic variables such as energy do not yield the corresponding variables of the whole system .",
    "non - additivity leads to many significant thermodynamic and dynamical consequences , such as negative microcanonical specific heat , inequivalence of statistical ensembles , and others , which are unusual with short - range interactions @xcite .    in this review ,",
    "starting with the first - order mean - field dynamics of the original kuramoto model , we progressively modify the dynamics by including first the effects of a gaussian noise , and then the consequences of an inertial term that makes the dynamics second order in time .",
    "in each case , we discuss the possible transitions to synchrony that the resulting stationary state exhibits . here",
    ", we will explicitly consider a unimodal distribution of the natural frequencies . while the derivation of the phase diagram in the original model is based on an insightful self - consistent approach due to kuramoto , inclusion of gaussian noise allows to employ usual tools of statistical mechanics and explicitly study the evolution of the phase space distribution by using a fokker - planck approach . in both these cases , the transition between the unsynchronized and the synchronized phase turns out to be continuous or second order .",
    "we conveniently study the dynamics of the generalized kuramoto model that includes the effects of both inertia and noise by introducing a reduced parameter space involving dimensionless moment of inertia , temperature , and width of the frequency distribution .",
    "we point out the relation of the model to the bmf model , thereby making references to the literature on long - range interacting systems .",
    "we give a rigorous proof that the system at long times settles into a ness unless the width of the frequency distribution is zero when it has an equilibrium stationary state .",
    "we highlight that the generalized dynamics exhibits a nonequilibrium first - order transition from a synchronized phase at low parameter values to an unsynchronized phase at high values . as a result , the system as a function of the transition parameters switches over in a discontinuous way from one phase to another , thereby mimicking an abrupt off - on switch .",
    "this may be contrasted to the case of no inertia when the transition is continuous . in proper limits ,",
    "we discuss how one may recover the known continuous phase transitions in the kuramoto model and in its noisy extension , and an equilibrium continuous transition in the bmf model .",
    "the present approach offers a complete and consistent picture of the phase diagram , unifying previous results with new ones in a common framework . in the last part of the review , we consider deviations from the mean - field setting of the kuramoto model . to this end",
    ", we analyze the generalized kuramoto dynamics on a one - dimensional periodic lattice on the sites of which the oscillators reside and interact with a coupling that decays as an inverse power - law of their separation along the lattice .",
    "we consider two specific cases of the dynamics , namely , in the absence of noise and inertia , and in the case when the natural frequencies are the same for all the oscillators ( giving rise to the so - called @xmath4-hmf model ) .",
    "for the latter case , we consider both overdamped and underdamped dynamics .",
    "in particular , we discuss how the long - time transition to synchrony is governed by the dynamics of the mean - field mode ( zero fourier mode ) of the spatial distribution of the oscillator phases . in this review , besides extensive numerical simulations , aspects of phase diagram are derived analytically by performing a linear stability analysis of the mean - field incoherent stationary state .",
    "moreover , for the case of the overdamped dynamics of the generalized kuramoto model on the lattice with the same natural frequency for all the oscillators , we present analytical results also on the linear stability analysis of the mean - field synchronized stationary state .",
    "we end the review with conclusions and perspectives .",
    "kuramoto - bare we start with a derivation of the dynamics of the kuramoto model by following ref . @xcite .",
    "consider first a single landau - stuart oscillator .",
    "its dynamics is given in terms of the complex variable @xmath5 as = iq + ( -|q|^2)q , ls with @xmath6 , and additionally , @xmath7 . in ref .",

    "then , setting @xmath17 leads to self - sustained limit - cycle oscillations at frequency @xmath12 with amplitude @xmath18 ; the phase @xmath11 varies as a function of time as = .",
    "next , consider a population of @xmath19 interacting landau - stuart oscillators with varying frequencies @xmath20 distributed according to a given probability distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath22th oscillator with angular frequency @xmath23 may be modelled as = i_i q_i + ( -|q_i|^2)q_i + _ j=1,ji^n k_ij q_j , ls - ii where the real parameter @xmath24 describes the coupling between the @xmath22th and the @xmath25th oscillator . in deriving his model while starting from the dynamics ( [ ls - ii ] ) , kuramoto considers three simplifying premises , namely ,    1 .   the limit of an infinite number of oscillators : @xmath26 , 2 .   the coupling @xmath27 scaling as @xmath28 with @xmath29 finite , implying thereby that every oscillator is coupled _ weakly _ and with equal strength to every other oscillator , and 3 .",
    "the limit @xmath30 , while keeping @xmath31 fixed and finite , and , moreover , @xmath32 being finite .",
    "writing @xmath33 , we see that because of the above assumptions , @xmath34 while starting from an initial value will relax over a time of @xmath35 to its limit - cycle value equal to @xmath36 . as a result , the long - time dynamics corresponds to self - sustained limit - cycle oscillations for each oscillator , which is described by the evolution equation = _ i+_j=1^n ( _ j-_i ) .",
    "kuramoto - eom equation ( [ kuramoto - eom ] ) is the governing dynamical equation of the kuramoto model .",
    "kuramoto most investigations of the kuramoto model have been for a unimodal @xmath21 , i.e. , one which is symmetric about the mean @xmath37 , and which decreases monotonically and continuously to zero with increasing @xmath38 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath39 the width of the distribution @xmath21 ( e.g. , for a gaussian distribution , @xmath39 is the standard deviation ) . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we will in this review consider specifically such frequency distributions . by going to a comoving frame rotating with frequency @xmath37 with respect to the laboratory frame ,",
    "one may from now on consider in the dynamics ( [ kuramoto - eom ] ) the @xmath23 s to have zero mean without loss of generality ; we will implement this in the rest of the review .    in his early works",
    ", kuramoto adduced a remarkable self - consistent analysis to predict the long - time stationary state of the dynamics ( [ kuramoto - eom ] ) .",
    "this analysis and its further generalizations have established that the stationary state is characterized by one of two possible phases , depending on whether @xmath29 is below or above a critical value @xmath40 , given by @xcite k_c=. kura - barekc the system for @xmath41 is in an unsynchronized or incoherent phase in which the oscillators exhibit independent oscillations , while for @xmath42 in a synchronized phase in which a macroscopic fraction of oscillators are in synchrony .",
    "on tuning @xmath29 , a continuous phase transition occurs between the two phases .",
    "more precisely , the kuramoto model being a dynamical system , one does not quite have a phase transition in the sense of thermodynamics , but rather a bifurcation for the order parameter , see below .",
    "for noisy dynamics , cases of which will be studied later in the review , a phase transition of course has its usual meaning as in thermodynamics . here , by synchrony , we mean that in the limit @xmath26 , the oscillators have time - independent phases in the comoving frame , and have therefore phases that rotate uniformly in time with the same frequency @xmath37 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the magnitude @xmath43 and the phase @xmath44 of the complex order parameter , defined as ( t)=r(t)e^i(t)_j=1^n e^i_j(t ) , r - defn measure the amount of synchronization and the average phase , respectively . for @xmath41 , @xmath43",

    "kuramoto - eom1    we now briefly recall a self - consistent analysis due to kuramoto @xcite that leads to equation ( [ kura - barekc ] ) .",
    "the starting point is to note that in the stationary state , the single - oscillator distribution @xmath49 , giving the fraction of oscillators with natural frequency @xmath12 that has phase @xmath50 at time @xmath51 , converges to the time - independent form @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath13 satisfies @xmath53 , and the normalization @xmath54 . when synchronized , the average phase in the stationary state , @xmath55 , will be a constant that may be set to zero by choosing properly the origin of the phase axes .",

    "as @xmath21 is symmetric : @xmath57 , the vanishing of the imaginary part is ensured if @xmath58 .",
    "this is indeed the case , as we will see below .",
    "on the basis of the above discussion , one may rewrite equation ( [ kuramoto - eom1 ] ) in the stationary state as = _",
    "r_st _ i. kuramoto - eom2    the result ( [ kura - barekc ] ) follows from a self - consistent equation derived by adopting the following strategy : at a fixed @xmath29 , and for a given value of @xmath56 , ( i ) obtain the stationary state distribution @xmath52 implied by the dynamics ( [ kuramoto - eom2 ] ) , and ( ii ) require that the distribution when plugged into the right hand side of equation ( [ r - st ] ) reproduces the given value of @xmath56 on the left hand side , thereby yielding the self - consistent equation ; we now demonstrate this procedure .",

    "on the other hand , oscillators with @xmath63 have ever drifting time - dependent phases .",
    "however , to be consistent with the fact that we have a time - independent average phase , it is required that @xmath64 for this group of `` drifting '' oscillators has the form _ st(,)= ;  || > kr_st ; kura - distr - drifting this ensures that oscillators are more crowded at @xmath50-values with lower local velocity @xmath65 than at values with higher local velocity .",

    "the imaginary part of the second integral vanishes on using @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the `` locked '' oscillators , see equation ( [ kura - distr - locked ] ) ; the real part , after integration over @xmath12 , finally yields r_st = kr_st_-/2^/2  ^2  g(kr_st ) , which is the desired self - consistent equation .",

    "one then derives that synchronization is a phase transition , characterized by the appearance of a non - vanishing value of an appropriate order parameter .",
    "we have shown that , interpreted as a system of interacting particles , the kuramoto model and its various extensions are long - range interacting lattice systems .",
    "furthermore , they are in their original setting mean - field systems , the extreme case of long - range interacting systems , where all pairs of particles interact with equal coupling strengths . we have also considered models where the coupling strengths decay slowly with the distance between the lattice sites .",
    "long - range systems often enjoy peculiar features , both in and out of equilibrium , due to the non - additivity of the interaction energy between subparts of the system .",
    "the form of the interaction in the kuramoto model and its extensions may be used as a prototypical interaction for studying these features .",
    "statistical dynamics of long - range systems , in the limit of a very large number of particles , can be very well described by equations that involve only the one - particle distribution function .",

    "stable stationary solutions of these equations correspond to stationary states in which the system remains trapped for a time that diverges with the system size ( the limit in which the equations for the one - particle distribution function become exact ) . as exemplified in this review ,",
    "the phase transitions mentioned above are then a change of the stability properties of the stationary states corresponding to the synchronized and the unsynchronized state .",

    "the transition becomes of first - order type : we have found that in certain ranges of the parameters , both the incoherent and the synchronized state are dynamically stable ( this situation is often referred to as bistability ) , with one of the two states being the globally stable state , depending on the variation of the parameters within the range .",

    ", we have focussed on one - dimensional lattices , with the parameter @xmath4 characterizing the decay being smaller than @xmath81 , to remain within the framework of long - range interactions .",
    "furthermore , we have imposed periodic boundary conditions . as we have stressed",
    "while introducing this class of systems , periodic boundary conditions cause the uniformity on the lattice of the equilibrium or stationary states , but they do not a priori rule out the influence of the lattice structure on the dynamical behavior .",
    "however , we have shown that the mean - field fourier mode of the spatial distribution of oscillator phases dominates the out - of - equilibrium dynamics at long times , since it is this mode that gets destabilized first on increasing the coupling constants or decreasing the temperature . on the other hand ,",

    "although we do not have analytical or numerical evidences , we feel that it is not unreasonable to adduce the hypothesis that also with more general boundary conditions , the mean - field mode is the one relevant for the dynamics ; however , we understand that without a detailed analysis , this statement remains at the level of speculation .",

    "when the stationary states of the single - particle equations are unstable , we expect that such relaxation does not depend on the size of the system , for large enough system size . on the other hand , stable states",
    "could be destabilized by finite - size effects . for example , in hamiltonian long - range systems , finite systems slowly evolve in time out of the stationary states of the vlasov equation that governs the dynamics for @xmath488 .",
