    "it has already been pointed out in the early days of quantum physics that the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) becomes unstable against the formation of many - body states in the presence of strong external electromagnetic fields , manifesting itself as the creation of electron - positron pairs by the schwinger mechanism @xcite . nevertheless , this fundamental quantum effect has not been experimentally observed so far as it has not been possible to generate the required electromagnetic field strengths in a laboratory .",
    "however , due to the rapid development of laser technology during the last decades an experimental verication of electron - positron pair production in the focus of high - intensity laser pulses comes into reach .",
    "vacuum pair production in an applied uniform electric field of strength @xmath1 may be viewed as a quantum process in which virtual electron - positron dipoles can be separated to become real pairs once they gain the binding energy of @xmath2 . however , there will be strong spatial and temporal inhomogeneities of the electromagnetic field in realistic situations as envisaged in upcoming high - intensity laser experiments .",
    "the theoretical description of such a non - perturbative phenomenon in quantum field theory out of equilibrium is a demanding task and very little is known so far for realistic scenarios .",
    "most current approaches assume the electromagnetic field as being an external one with a one - dimensional inhomogeneity , so that the problem of particle production can be mapped onto a one - dimensional quantum mechanical scattering problem @xcite .",
    "this approach neglects , in particular , the backreaction of the created fermion ",
    "anti - fermion pairs on the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is closely related to kinetic descriptions in terms of a momentum dependent distribution function of pairs in collisionless ( vlasov ) approximations @xcite . for multi - dimensional inhomogeneities , more advanced approaches such as semi - classical approximations of the vacuum effective action @xcite or the dirac - heisenberg - wigner phase space formulation @xcite",
    "have been applied . however , to describe strongly inhomogeneous field configurations including the full backreaction of the produced particles remains a theoretical challenge . in view of the potential experimental applications it is crucial to devise new theoretical methods which can deal with this situation .    in this work",

    "we compute for the first time the backreaction of the created pairs on the gauge fields .",
    "most strikingly , we find that a self - consistent electric field between the produced fermion and the anti - fermion bunch builds up for times exceeding the initial pulse duration .",
    "the two bunches consisting of particles and anti - particles act as a capacitor , creating a homogeneous electric field between them , which can be represented in terms of a linear rising potential .    from the point of view of theoretical developments , it is important to note that very similar questions are addressed in physics of the early universe or in collision experiments of heavy nuclei .",
    "non - equilibrium particle creation from large coherent fields has been extensively studied in the context of inflaton dynamics @xcite and non - abelian gauge field theory @xcite .",
    "the production of fermion  anti - fermion pairs has been mainly investigated based on semi - classical descriptions using the dirac equation coupled to time - dependent background fields @xcite .",
    "going beyond these approximations , studies based on two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action techniques @xcite showed that quantum effects can dramatically affect the far - from - equilibrium production of fermion pairs . recently , pair production from scalar inflaton decay @xcite as well as baryogenesis @xcite has been studied using similar lattice field theory methods as employed in this work .",
