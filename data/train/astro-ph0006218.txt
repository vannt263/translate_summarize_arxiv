    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) family of cosmological models provides an excellent description of a wide variety of observational results , from the earlier observable epochs detected via microwave background fluctuations to present - day observations of galaxies and large - scale structure .",
    "a  concordance model \" with roughly one - third matter and two - thirds vacuum energy , either a cosmological constant or quintessence ( @xcite ) , is consistent with almost all current observations on scales @xmath2  mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , improving observations and numerical techniques have enabled a comparison of cdm scenarios to observations on galactic scales of @xmath3  few  kpc .",
    "the results have not been encouraging .",
    "there are a number of distinct observations that may be in conflict with predictions of cdm :    * the density profile of galaxies in the inner few kiloparsecs appears to be much shallower than predicted by numerical simulations ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) . for density profiles characterized by @xmath4 as @xmath5 ,",
    "cdm predicts @xmath6 with little scatter ( @xcite 1999 ) , while current h@xmath7 observations suggest @xmath8 with significant scatter ( @xcite ; @xcite , though see @xcite ) . * the central density of dark matter halos is observed to be @xmath9 roughly independent of halo mass ( @xcite ) , while cdm predicts halos with @xmath10 at dwarf galaxy masses , increasing to larger masses ( @xcite 1999 ) . *",
    "the number of dwarf galaxies in the local group is an order of magnitude fewer than predicted by cdm simulations , with the discrepancy growing towards smaller masses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "* hydrodynamic simulations produce galaxy disks that are too small and have too little angular momentum , yielding a tully - fisher relation whose zero - point is off by several magnitudes from observations ( @xcite ) . *",
    "the robustness of rapidly rotating bars in high surface brightness spiral galaxies implies lower density cores than predicted by cdm ( @xcite ) . *",
    "cluster cl  0024 + 1654 is nearly spherical with a large , soft core , while cdm typically predicts triaxial clusters with cuspy cores ( @xcite , though see miralda - escud 2000 for a counterexample ) .",
    "each piece of evidence taken individually is perhaps not convincing enough to claim that cdm has failed on galactic scales .",
    "for instance , until recently there was controversy amongst simulators regarding inner profiles ( @xcite ) , but more careful simulations have converged on a consistent prediction ( @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , inner galactic profiles are uncertain due to beam smearing effects in observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , though samples of high - resolution h@xmath7 observations continue to show shallower profiles than predicted by cdm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the number of observed local group dwarf galaxies may be reconciled with cdm via plausible scenarios for suppressed galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ) , or else compact high - velocity clouds could represent the  missing satellites \" that are seen in @xmath0-body simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxy formation are fraught with the usual concerns about the effects of feedback , artificial viscosity and resolution , though it appears the discrepancies above are due to the underlying dark matter distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "it becomes more interesting to consider alternatives to conventional cdm when one recognizes that all these discrepancies may be symptomatic of a single cause : _ dark matter halos in cdm simulations appear to be more centrally concentrated than observed .",
    "_ recognizing this , various authors have recently forwarded a plethora of alternative dark matter theories that suppress the central concentration of dark matter in galaxy halos . among such theories",
    "are that the dark matter is warm ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , repulsive ( @xcite ) , fluid ( @xcite ) , fuzzy ( @xcite ) , decaying ( @xcite ) , annihilating ( @xcite ) , and the alternative we investigate here , self - interacting ( sidm ; spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , all theories may be tuned to solve the problems mentioned above ( at least in analytic approximations ) , all theories may be motivated from particle physics considerations , and all theories retain the desirable properties of cdm on extragalactic scales ( though warm dark matter is non - trivially constrained by this requirement ; see @xcite ) .",
    "sidm is governed by a single free parameter , the cross section per unit mass @xmath11 of the interacting dark matter particle .",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath12 in order to reduce the central concentration of galaxy halos by a sufficient amount to alleviate the above problems .",
    "intriguingly , this value is close to the cross section of ordinary hadrons , motivating some particular particle physics candidates for sidm ( steinhardt et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "if @xmath11 is significantly smaller than this range , then the optical depth at galactic densities is much less than unity , implying that sidm would have a negligible effect on the dark matter distribution in halos .",
    "a qualitative picture of the evolution of an sidm halo is as follows : at early times there is no difference between sidm and cdm since the densities and peculiar velocities are sufficiently low that collisions are rare ; hence sidm makes identical predictions to cdm regarding cosmic microwave background fluctuations and the lyman alpha forest . as the halo forms and grows via gravitational instability , the central density increases .",
    "eventually , collisions are so frequent that dark matter particles scatter out of the center as fast as they are accreted , and the density growth is halted , forming a core .",
    "such a limit is not present in the cdm model , where the central density grows unchecked .",
    "the sidm core then begins to extend while retaining constant central density .",
    "heat transfer from the outer parts of the halo raises the temperature in the halo core .",
    "if the halo is truly isolated , then eventually the core thermalizes with the exterior resulting in an isothermal halo with a steep density profile .",
    "this initiates gravothermal collapse , where the direction of heat transfer is reversed and the exterior begins to cool the halo center .",
    "however , in a realistic cosmological setting , galaxies constantly accrete material , keeping the outer halo hot and heat flowing inwards , thus delaying core collapse .",
    "the interplay between collisional heat transfer and accretion determines whether a halo will undergo core collapse in a hubble time .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the transport behavior does not change monotonically with @xmath11 . for small cross - sections ,",
    "heat transfer increases with @xmath11 since the frequency of collisions increases ; however , for large cross - sections , the conductivity @xmath13 and no heat transfer occurs .",
    "thus , as we discuss in  [ sec : comparison ] , the fluid approximation is a poor decription of sidm in the moderate cross - section regime proposed by spergel and steinhardt .",
    "furthermore , the behavior in the moderate cross - section regime can not be surmised by interpolating between the fluid and the non - interacting cdm regimes . a proper treatment of the sidm proposal , which includes the interplay of accretion and heat transfer , its non - monotonic dependence @xmath11 , and the effects of merging demands numerical simulations designed to explore the moderate cross - section regime .",
    "in this paper we investigate the statistical properties of halos in sidm and cdm in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "our spatial and mass resolutions are sufficient to probe the inner regions ( @xmath14 ) of small halos ( @xmath15  few@xmath16 ) , while maintaining sufficient volume so as to have a significant sample of such halos .",
    "we use a monte carlo technique similar to @xcite ( 2000 ) to model collisions . the primary difference between our simulations and prior investigations ( discussed in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : comparison ] ) is that we model a cosmologically - significant random volume of the universe with self - interaction cross sections in the range favored by @xcite , enabling us to characterize the statistical properties of halos as we vary @xmath11 .    ",

    "however , the effect of subhalo suppression in these sidm simulations should be regarded as a lower limit to the true strength of the effect .",
    "the reason is that almost all these subhalos are well below our monte carlo resolution limit ( dotted line in figure  12 ) , therefore their concentrations are approaching those in cdm models .",
    "thus tidal disruption of these halos is not much stronger in sidm as in cdm , and is increasingly similar to lower masses .",

    "it is not clear why different hydrodynamic codes give different results when they should be operating in the same regime .",
    "perhaps the effective cross section is larger in the adaptive mesh code due to algorithmic differences , reducing heat transfer .",
    "another possibility is that a numerical effect in sph in which cold clumps moving through hot halos have their drag significantly overestimated ( @xcite ) makes objects rapidly sink into a dense , isothermal core .",

    ", this is one of the strongest tests of the sidm paradigm , as near the center _ any _ value of @xmath11 that has a non - negligible effect on the dark matter distribution will increase the core sphericity , while cdm cores are almost always significantly triaxial .",
    "however , baryons are likely to dominate the shapes of the inner parts of halos , complicating a direct comparison , and in the outer parts the differences between sidm and cdm are less pronounced .",
    "the number of subhalos around our largest ( milky way - sized ) halo is somewhat reduced with increasing @xmath11 , but due to discreteness effects in our monte carlo @xmath0-body technique , we can not put robust quantitative estimates on the strength of this effect .",
    "based on these simulations , our currently favored value for @xmath11 is somewhere between @xmath59 and @xmath73 .",
    "such a cross section simultaneously reproduces both the observed central density and inner slope , as well as being consistent with various observations considered here , which is non - trivial .",
    "in contrast , for instance , warm dark matter has difficulty simultaneously reproducing the observed central densities , inner slopes and subhalo population ( @xcite ) .    as stated before",
    ", inner halo shapes may provide a strong discriminant between cdm and sidm .",
    "on galactic scales , they are difficult to observe and confused by baryonic contributions .",
    "conversely , clusters provide a cleaner test because they have large cores that are not baryon - dominated , and their mass distributions are directly observable via lensing .",
    "@xcite uses the asphericity of cluster ms  2137 - 23 to ( analytically ) argue that @xmath210 , effectively ruling out sidm as a solution to halo concentration problems . on the other hand , cl  0024 + 1654 is very spherical , much more so than cdm models generally predict ( @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations can not directly address the shapes of clusters , as we have no cluster - sized objects in our volume .",
    "however , sidm shows some range of halo shapes due to asymmetric infall and unrelaxed mass distributions , so it is unclear whether a single object can definitively rule out sidm .",
    "support for this statement is provided by @xcite , whose cluster has enough triaxiality to be consistent with ms  2137 - 23 even for @xmath195 ( their model s1wb ) , contradicting miralda - escud s scaling argument .",
    "we note that halo shapes are unaffected by annihilating ( @xcite ) or decaying ( @xcite ) dark matter , thus they also provide a discriminant between these variants and sidm .",
    "the cluster core sizes in the simulations of @xcite are larger than observed ( @xmath211 , @xcite ; @xcite ) , certainly for @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) , and probably even for @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) . so it may be that sidm has difficulty matching observations at both dwarf galaxy and cluster scales . however",
    ", adiabatic contraction of baryons during the formation of the cd galaxy will reduce the cluster core radius from @xmath0-body predictions , so the discrepancy may not be that large . in any case , sidm with @xmath212 comes remarkably close to matching dwarf galaxies , @xmath213 galaxies and clusters given the @xmath214 range in mass scales , so we reserve judgement pending a more careful comparison with observations .",
    "@xcite mention that sidm core sizes would be in better agreement with observations if @xmath215 , which would result in the effects of self - interactions being diminished in hot cluster environments as compared to galaxies .",
    "such a scenario occurs naturally if the dark matter ",
    "dark matter scattering has low - lying resonance or bound state contributions , as is the case for ordinary nucleons .",
    "another theoretical avenue explored in relation to sidm has been modeling the tully - fisher relation .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations show that the simulated tully - fisher zero point may be brought into agreement with observations only if halos are less centrally concentrated than predicted by cdm ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "determine that a cross section of @xmath216 would produce a correct tully - fisher relation for @xmath217  km / s halos .",
    "thus it is conceivable that the cross section preferred from halo structure constraints may also alleviate the tully - fisher discrepancies .",
    "@xcite suggested that dark matter interactions in the centers of halos naturally produce central black holes with a mass scaling @xmath218 , in agreement with observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and he estimates @xmath219 in order to avoid central black holes that are too large .",
    "however , this estimate is based on an @xmath220 profile all the way in to the black hole .",
    "if such a dense center never arises because collisions inhibit its formation , then the limits on @xmath11 are weakened considerably .",
    "observations of dark matter halos promise to improve significantly in the coming years , particularly constraints on halo core shapes from lensing and on inner profiles and concentrations of halos from h@xmath7 rotation curves .",
    "if the inner parts of dark matter halos are found to be generically triaxial , this would be the high place of sacrifice for self - interacting dark matter ; conversely , spherical halos would provide strong support for this scenario .",
    "the main modeling work yet to be is done is an improved examination of the subhalo populations in sidm , as well as simulations of a larger range of mass scales .",
    "the @xmath0-body monte carlo approach has difficulty achieving a large dynamic range due to the stringent monte carlo resolution limit ( i.e. discreteness effects in the probabalistic description of collisions ) , therefore a different approach may be necessary .",
    "the sidm simulations presented here are a first attempt at examining the effect of self - interacting dark matter within the context of a realistic halo formation scenario .",
    "the results are quite encouraging that this simple variant of the cold dark matter paradigm will alleviate a wide range of difficulties faced by cdm on galactic scales .",
    "we look forward to further investigations and comparisons with observations .",
