    "the interaction of the radio source with the cluster gas is thought to be important because , at the present epoch , the inferred , model - dependent , kinetic power in the jet is in the range @xmath10  erg  s@xmath8 ( bicknell & begelman 1999 ) , which may exceed the total x - ray luminosity of the cooling core ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath8 ; fabricant & gorenstein , 1983 ) . observations with _ einstein _",

    "[ fig : beta ] .",
    "it is notable that these two roughly circular features are just outside the inner radio lobe and at comparable nuclear distance to the intermediate radio ridges , respectively .",
    "this correspondence suggests the `` edges '' may have resulted from time variability in the active nucleus , perhaps being associated with past epochs of jet production . in the model of rhb , a short episode of jet activity eventually produces buoyant bubbles of radio plasma that rise at @xmath25 times the sound speed , along with a spherical `` pulse '' that expands at approximately the sound speed .",

    "are expected to be present in the late - time evolution of a lower power ( fr - i ) radio source , such as m87 .",
    "this model is discussed further in section  [ sec : fronts ] .",
    "the most striking feature on large scales is an x - ray `` arc '' running from @xmath24 33 east of the nucleus , across the central region of m87 , to @xmath24 4@xmath26 to the southwest ( figs [ fig : cxo ] and [ fig : color_cxo_radio ] ) . on the east side of the nucleus",

    ", the narrow arc passes to the south of the intermediate scale radio ridges 2  ",
    "3  west of the nucleus . further out , the arc follows diffuse filaments of radio emission that connect the intermediate scale radio ridges with the fainter , outer radio halo .",
    "to get an idea of the spatial variation of the properties of the intra - cluster medium we first constructed an emission - weighted temperature map . to do this , images were made in soft ( 0.5  0.9  kev ) , medium ( 0.9  1.2  kev ) and hard ( 1.2  4  kev ) energy bands .",
    "the background subtracted data were then adaptively binned ( sanders & fabian 2001 ) to ensure comparable fractional errors per bin in each band .",
    "theoretical color ratio tables were computed as a function of temperature and metalicity using the mekal thermal plasma model in xspec , assuming absorption by only the galactic column .",
    "the color ratios of the data were compared with these theoretically computed color ratios to construct a temperature map of the virgo cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] ) .",
    "a few things are immediately apparent from the emission - weighted temperature map : ( i ) gas in the x - ray arc is cooler than surrounding intra - cluster gas at a similar nuclear distance , ( ii ) there is a region of cooler gas immediately surrounding the nucleus extending @xmath27 to the north and @xmath28 to the south , corresponding to the region of higher surface brightness around the nucleus ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cxo ] ) , and ( iii ) there is no evidence of strong shock heating associated with the inner radio lobes .",
    "since a deprojection analysis was not performed , the temperature map shows the emission - weighted mean temperature in each bin .",
    "if the gas distribution is approximately spherically symmetric , with the density rapidly increasing inwards , the properties of the gas in a given bin are dominated by the properties of the gas at the same distance from the nucleus as the projected distance of the bin from the nucleus .",
    "the azimuthally averaged brightness profile of the inner part of the virgo cluster is well described ( i.e. to within @xmath29 at all nuclear distances ; see fig .",

    "hri results ( bhringer 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray emission from the virgo cluster is strongly peaked towards the center with the possible exception of the inner @xmath34 and the x - ray arcs , so the inferred temperatures are a reasonable approximation to the temperatures of gas at that physical distance from the nucleus .    motivated by the temperature map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] ) , spectra were extracted from a number of @xmath35 square regions , each containing @xmath36 counts , to compare , in detail , the gas properties in the arc and the ambient intra - cluster medium .",
    "an emission - weighted instrument response was made for each region , and the individual spectra were modeled by either ( i ) a single temperature vmekal thermal plasma model or ( ii ) a two temperature vmekal model if the additional component improved the @xmath37/d.o.f . by @xmath38 .",
    "the abundances of o , mg , si , s and fe were allowed to vary but , if a two temperature model was used , both components were constrained to have the same abundances .",
    "the variation of temperature(s ) with nuclear distance for different azimuthal angles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_vs_r ] .",
    "the arc to the east and southwest is much better described by a two temperature model , with temperatures of @xmath39  kev and @xmath3  kev .",
    "in contrast , the ambient gas is , in general , better described by a single temperature model with the temperature rising outwards from @xmath40  kev at 6  kpc to @xmath41  kev at @xmath42  kpc .",
    "the region within @xmath43  9  kpc , corresponding approximately to the apparently cooler gas immediately surrounding the nucleus ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : temp ] ) , is also better described by a two temperature model , with temperatures of @xmath3  kev and @xmath44  kev .",
    "the properties of the gas in the arc are clearly different from those in the surrounding cluster gas .    focusing on the cooler region immediately surrounding the nucleus , we see that the coolest gas in the central arcminute is well correlated with optical h@xmath4 + [ n ii ] @xmath22 , 6584 line emission , which is also concentrated to the north of the nucleus ( sparks et al . 1993 ; our fig .",

    ", there is another small filament of h@xmath4 + [ n ii ] emitting gas located near the northwestern corner of the `` ear '' ( gavazzi et al .",

    ", the emission measure was converted to an electron density by assuming the path length through the bin is equal to the distance of that bin from the nucleus , an assumption supported by the rapid increase of x - ray surface brightness towards smaller nuclear distances ( see above discussion ) . the electron density ( and gas pressure )",
    "are @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the path length through the gas so a factor of 2 error in the path length would correspond to only a factor of @xmath47 error in these quantities . to minimize the error in the assumed path length",
    ", we treated the arcs to east and southwest separately and assumed the path length through an arc is 1 kpc for those regions of the arc at a nuclear distance @xmath48 ( @xmath49 kpc ) . the cooling time was computed using the cooling function of sarazin & white ( 1987 ) for solar metallicity gas , correcting for the printing error noted by westbury & henriksen ( 1992 ) .",
    "the rate of cooling ( @xmath50 ) of solar metallicity gas is faster than zero metallicity gas by factors of @xmath40 , 2 and 6 at temperatures of 10 , 2 and 1 kev , respectively .    the electron density , total gas pressure and cooling time are shown in fig .  [ fig : d_p_ct ] as a function of nuclear distance for a number of different azimuthal angles .",
    "away from the arc , the density and pressure decline rapidly with increasing nuclear distance while the cooling time rises .",

    "( bhringer et al . 2001 ) and the run of density with nuclear distance being consistent with _ rosat _ ( nulsen & bhringer 1995 ) . the gas in the arcs , however , is denser and probably over - pressured with respect to the surrounding cluster gas at a similar nuclear distance ; a deprojection analysis of the ambient cluster emission would provide a more accurate estimate of the pressure of the ambient gas , but would be limited by the lack of symmetry of the x - ray emission .",
    "in addition , the density and pressure decline more slowly with increasing nuclear distance in the arc than in the surrounding cluster gas , although the slope of this decline is sensitive to the assumed path length through the gas in the arc .",

    "if we assume the `` holes '' in the x - ray gas that correspond to the inner radio lobes ( see fig . [ fig : cxo_radio_halpha ] ) are cavities created by the radio jet then we can make a crude estimate of the minimum power of the jet .",

    "the structure in the radial distribution of x - ray surface brightness ( see figs [ fig : cxo ]    [ fig : color_cxo_radio ] ) could be some effect inherent to a cooling flow .",
    "however , we have noted ( section [ sec : morphology ] ) that the two most noticeable sharp declines in azimuthally averaged x - ray surface brightness are just outside the inner radio lobes and at comparable nuclear distance to the intermediate radio ridges .",
    "this similarity between the nuclear distances of the radio lobes and the declines in surface brightness suggests instead that the `` edges '' may be `` fronts '' in the cluster atmosphere created by earlier ejecta from the active nucleus of m87 .",
    "we consider a scenario based on the results of numerical hydrodynamical simulations by rhb of the effects of the jets on the intra - cluster medium .",
    "rhb discuss their simulation results in the context of powerful fr - ii radio galaxies but the end results are expected to be similar in a weaker fr - i radio galaxy .",
    "the end effect of the transient jet activity is that the cluster expands in response to heating of the cluster core .",
    "an approximately spherical pulse propagates outwards at the sound speed ( see fig .  6 of rhb ) , ultimately leaving the core of the cluster at a fractionally lower density and a higher temperature .",
    "the amplitude of the density wave in the rhb simulation is @xmath72 which is dependent upon the initial conditions but is large enough to produce the @xmath73 fluctuations seen in the azimuthally averaged x - ray surface brightness when compared to the best fitting `` @xmath30-model '' shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] .",
    "the fact that the two fronts are at slightly larger nuclear distances than the inner radio lobes and the intermediate ridges suggests that each of these radio features is in the `` passive '' or buoyant bubble phase that characterizes the late stage of evolution .",
    "such would be consistent with the absence of strong shocks around the cavities inflated by the inner radio lobes .",
    "the @xmath74 ( 12 kpc ) separation of successive fronts corresponds to a sound crossing time of @xmath75  yrs , and indicates there may be relatively brief periods of jet activity every @xmath76  yrs or so .",
    "if this is the case , the time - averaged energy injected into the cluster by the jet may be significantly lower than the present instantaneous power of the jet .",
    "further detailed numerical simulations , tailored to the environment of m87 , are required to determine whether such a model can indeed reproduce the `` fronts '' and what conditions are needed .",
    "in particular , such simulations are required to find out what effect the putative pulse has on the cluster core .",
    "the model of rhb also predicts subtle ( tens of per cent ) changes in the gas temperature associated with the changes in x - ray surface brightness , and while these changes are too small to be detected in our data set , one could look for them in a future observation with a significantly longer integration time .",
    "our observations of the x - ray arcs to the east and southwest and associated with the radio ridges show that they are narrow , with a fwhm of only @xmath77 ( 1 kpc ) .",
    "the length to width ratio of the southwestern arc is @xmath78 .",
    "we have also found ( section [ sec : t_p_ct ] ) that the gas in the arcs is cooler than the surrounding cluster gas , in agreement with previous studies , and appears to contain two components with different temperatures .",
    "the cooler component may have some metal abundances enhanced with respect to the warmer gas in the cluster ( table  [ tab : spec ] , section  [ sec : abund ] ) .",
    "a number of models have been proposed to explain these arcs .",
    "firstly , it should be noted that although the x - ray emissivity of the gas may be enhanced by compression , shocks or cosmic ray heating processes tend to raise the gas temperature rather than lower it , and can be ruled out ( bhringer et al .",
    "another possibility is that , as the radio ejecta ( which are likely to be in the late `` buoyant plume '' phase [ rhb ] ; cf .",
    "section  [ sec : fronts ] ) pass through a multi - phase cooling flow , they disrupt the `` cold '' phase ( consisting of cold , denser clouds ) and mix it with the `` hot '' phase .",
    "this causes a rapid cooling of the hot phase and an enhancement of the density ( bhringer et al .",
    "however , whether the ambient intra - cluster medium is , in fact , multi - phase remains controversial ( we are able to adequately describe most of the intra - cluster gas as a single temperature plasma ) .",
    "a further possibility is that cooler , low entropy gas near the nucleus is mixed into the radio plasma , generating buoyant bubbles of gas ( churazov et al .",
    "2001 ; brggen et al .",
    "2002 ; rhb ) .",
    "these bubbles would rise in the cluster gravitational field and expand until they have a density equal to that of the surrounding medium .",
    "the in - situ disruption of gas in a cold phase , followed by mixing , should leave cooler gas with metal abundances comparable to the surrounding cluster gas . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cool gas was entrained at a small nuclear distance and carried outwards , the buoyant bubbles of cold gas should have metal abundances appropriate to the cluster core .",
    "as discussed above ( section  [ sec : abund ] ) , we find that the cooler gas ( see table  [ tab : spec ] ) in the arc probably has a higher metalicity for at least some elements than the ambient gas .",
    "these higher abundances favor the buoyant bubble scenario .",
    "the morphology of the x - ray arcs ( i.e. narrow and well collimated ) is consistent with the churazov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and rhb models in which a narrow column of dense gas is created .",
    "the numerical simulations of both churazov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and rhb assumed axi - symmetry which may artificially stabilize narrow structures elongated along the symmetry axis , although reasonably narrow , dense structures with an aspect ratio of @xmath79 are also produced in the fully 3d simulations of brggen et al .",
    "the sound - crossing time from the nucleus to a nuclear distance of @xmath80 is a @xmath81 yrs , which is shorter than the cooling time of gas in the arcs , which is @xmath82 yrs and closer to @xmath83 yrs at a nuclear distance of @xmath80 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : d_p_ct ] ) .",
    "this means that there is time for cool gas entrained by a buoyant bubble in the nucleus to be carried to the end of the arc before it has cooled completely . if this were not the case , i.e. if the cooling time of gas in the arcs was shorter than the sound - crossing time , then some in - situ heating mechanism",
    "would be required , or the cool gas must have been transported faster than the sound speed .",
    "the simulation by rhb produces both elongated , buoyant plumes which lift gas from the center of the cluster and approximately spherical pulses traveling at the sound speed that we have identified with the x - ray `` fronts '' . in this sense",
    ", the structure of the intra - cluster medium in the inner part of the virgo cluster conforms qualitatively to the expected effects of repeated injections of energy over a period of 10@xmath84 yrs by radio jets from the nucleus of virgo a.",
    "we have presented the highest resolution x - ray image to date of the core of the virgo cluster .",
    "structure is observed on all spatial scales , from arcsecond ( @xmath85 pc ) to ten arcminutes ( @xmath86 kpc ) .",
    "the inner radio lobes are aligned with depressions in the x - ray surface brightness and there is no evidence of shock heating in the x - ray emission immediately surrounding the inner radio lobes , suggesting that the radio plasma has gently pushed aside the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "these cavities can not have been inflated much slower than the sound speed , however , or they would have risen too far from the nucleus due to buoyancy effects .",
    "we estimate the jet power to be @xmath87 erg s@xmath8 .    on larger scales",
    "the most striking feature is the x - ray arc running from the east , across the central regions of m87 , and off to the southwest .",
    "the gas in the arc has at least two temperatures , with one component at the temperature of the ambient intra - cluster medium and a cooler component at @xmath3 kev .",
    "the gas in the arcs is probably over - pressured with respect to , and somewhat more metal rich than , the ambient intra - cluster medium .",
    "abrupt changes in surface brightness or `` fronts '' are seen at nuclear distances slightly larger than the nuclear distances of the inner radio lobes and intermediate radio ridges . within the inner front , at nuclear distances @xmath88 ( @xmath89 kpc ) the gas has at least two temperatures , with the cooler component at @xmath3 kev , similar to the x - ray arc .",
    "this cooler region is concentrated more to the north than the south of the nucleus and is correlated with the h@xmath4 + [ nii ] emission - line distribution .",
    "we suggest that a model based on the hydrodynamical simulations of rhb , scaled to a lower power radio source such as m87 , may explain the observed phenomena .",
    "intermittent jet activity has two effects on the cluster .",
    "firstly , it inflates buoyant bubbles of radio plasma that trail cold gas from the central regions in their wakes as they rise at @xmath90  0.7 times the sound speed , thereby producing the x - ray arcs .",
    "the gas dredged up from the nucleus is expected to have higher metal abundances than the intra - cluster medium at large nuclear distances .",
    "secondly , at late times in the evolution of the radio source , the injection of energy into the cluster core produces a `` pulse '' that expands at the sound speed into the intra - cluster medium as the cluster adjusts to find a new equilibrium .",
    "we identify this pulse with the observed x - ray `` fronts '' .",
    "detailed numerical simulations tailored to the virgo cluster are required to explore this hypothesis .",
