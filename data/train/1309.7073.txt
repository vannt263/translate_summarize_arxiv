    "many biological systems involve mobile or fixed charges , the electrostatic response of which is key to our understanding of the physical behavior of such systems .",

    "the interactions that arise from the presence of these charges are crucial in the determination of the structure and function of these polymers @xcite .",
    "biological processes such as signaling in cells involve the creation of electrical potential differences and transport of ions across the cellular membrane @xcite . on the other hand , in the design and stabilization of many different synthetic structures , the electrostatic forces play a major role .",
    "examples include self - assembled colloidal dispersions @xcite , polynucleotide adsorption @xcite , dna precipitation in multivalent salts @xcite , overcharged surfaces @xcite , patterned surfaces @xcite , spontaneous adsorption of ions at liquid - liquid interfaces@xcite , faceted thin shells @xcite , viral assembly @xcite , and various dynamical processes including dna gel electrophoresis @xcite and related polyelectrolyte separation process @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations of these interesting materials and biological systems must therefore accurately incorporate electrostatic interactions .    under the conditions of high ionic concentration or in the presence of multivalent ions , when the finite size of ions and the inter - ionic correlations become significant , mean",
    "field theories are generally found inadequate to capture important electrostatic effects @xcite . for arbitrarily curved geometries or where the dielectric response of the medium is not homogeneous , the associated electrostatics problem gets too complicated even for the more sophisticated analytical treatments @xcite , and the use of numerical techniques becomes necessary .",
    "however , an accurate computer simulation involving electrostatic interactions presents its own challenges .",
    "the first challenge stems from the long range of the coulomb force which implies that every charge interacts with every other charge .",
    "thus , a system of @xmath0 charges requires an expensive @xmath1 force ( or energy ) calculation at every simulation step .",
    "attempts to ameliorate this scaling behavior have resulted in the development of several methods : e.g , ewald summation , particle - mesh methods , fast multipole methods @xcite , and local electrostatics algorithms @xcite .",
    "the other main challenge arises due to the presence of dielectric heterogeneities in the medium , and this constitutes the main focus of the present paper .",
    "free charges polarize their surrounding dielectric medium and the resulting net polarization and electric fields can have complex behavior .",
    "modeling of systems with electrostatic interactions should , ideally , incorporate this dielectric response of the medium .",
    "an explicit inclusion of the medium components ( molecules of the solvent , for example ) as a part of the model for the real system renders a prohibitively large number of degrees of freedom to simulate , such that even with the most efficient methods @xcite direct simulation becomes too computationally expensive . in many cases , the introduction of a spatially varying dielectric constant in the model is sufficient to capture the effects of polarizability and describe the dielectric response . in the simplest case of a uniform dielectric response , a single dielectric",
    "constant can describe a coarse - grained medium , and simulations can proceed as they would in free space , albeit with a scaled coulomb s law .    however , most real situations involve regions with different dielectric response , as is the case for proteins within an aqueous cellular medium or for emulsions where oil and water are partitioned @xcite . in the presence of this varying dielectric response , the simplest form of coulomb s law breaks down and one has to accurately solve the poisson equation , at _ each _ simulation step , to obtain the necessary force ( energy ) information for the propagation of ionic coordinates .",
    "this adversely affects the stability and efficiency of the resulting numerical procedure . because of these computational challenges , the problem of treating dielectric heterogeneities in charge simulations continues to be a subject of intense research @xcite .    a few previous attempts towards the solution of the problem of inhomogeneous dielectric response have involved a reformulation of electrostatics as a variational problem @xcite . here , the solution to the poisson equation is obtained not as a solution of a differential equation , but as the extremum of a suitably constructed functional @xcite",
    ". an important advantage of adopting a variational approach is that it offers the possibility of bypassing the effort to explicitly optimize the functional at each step by framing the problem in such a way that the very process of updating the simulation guarantees the optimization of the functional . in other words , since the optimization of the functional is equivalent to the solution of the poisson equation , we are offered the possibility of solving the poisson equation _ on - the - fly _ in tandem with the generation of the new charge configuration .",
    "however , this possibility arises only when the variational approach is based on an energy functional : a functional which _ minimizes _ to the _ true _ electrostatic energy .",
    "we note that in the literature , there is an abundance of functionals that are _ not _ energy functionals @xcite and therefore the numerical schemes associated with these functionals do not employ the ideas of dynamical optimization .",
    "in addition to the need for a true energy functional for an efficient numerical implementation of the variational procedure , it is also crucial to produce a functional with the appropriate function variable(s ) . in many cases a particular electrostatic variable offers distinct advantage over others .",
    "for example , a coarse - grained model often employed to study phenomena in both biological and synthetic settings is that of ions present in piecewise - uniform dielectrics separated by sharp interfaces ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in this case , it is advantageous to choose the polarization charge density as the variable to solve for , rather than the electrostatic potential or the polarization vector .",
    "this is because when the dielectric response of the medium is piecewise uniform , the unknown polarization charge density resides only on the interface , and thus we are presented with the possibility to reduce the full three - dimensional electrostatic problem to a two - dimensional one .",
    "a uniform dielectric medium characterized by permittivity @xmath2 separated from another region of permittivity @xmath3 by a boundary that is treated as a thin interface . positive ( red ) and negative ( green ) ions are present in either media .",
    "coarse - grained models of this kind are often employed to study systems such as charged bio - macromolecules in aqueous solution or charged colloidal suspensions . ]    in the light of the above discussion , it is clear that an energy functional of the polarization charge density would provide many advantages with regards to the numerical implementation of the variational method formulated to study problems involving dielectric heterogeneities . in the literature",

    "<S> in biological and synthetic materials , many important processes involve charges that are present in a medium with spatially varying dielectric permittivity . to accurately understand the role of electrostatic interactions in such systems , it is important to take into account the spatial dependence of the permittivity of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the ensuing theoretical and computational challenges , this inhomogeneous dielectric response of the medium is often ignored or excessively simplified . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a variational formulation of electrostatics to accurately investigate systems that exhibit this inhomogeneous dielectric response . </S>",
    "<S> our formulation is based on a true energy functional of the polarization charge density . </S>",
    "<S> the defining characteristic of a true energy functional is that at its minimum it evaluates to the actual value of the energy ; this is a feature not found in many commonly used electrostatic functionals . </S>",
    "<S> we explore in detail the charged systems that exhibit sharp discontinuous change in dielectric permittivity , and we show that for this case our functional reduces to a functional of only the surface polarization charge density . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this reduced functional to study model problems for which analytical solutions are well known . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , in addition , that the functional has many properties that make it ideal for use in molecular dynamics simulations . </S>"
