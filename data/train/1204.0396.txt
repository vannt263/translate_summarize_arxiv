    "cosmic strings are topological defects that are predicted to have formed via the kibble mechanism @xcite during one of the phase transitions in the early universe and in the field theoretical description @xcite can be considered to be an example of a topological soliton . due to the fact that these objects can be extremely heavy they were believed to be a possible source of the density perturbations that led to structure formation and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed measurement of the cmb power spectrum as obtained by cobe , boomerang and wmap showed that cosmic strings can not be the main source for these anisotropies .",
    "however , in recent years it has been suggested that cosmic strings should generically form at the end of inflation in inflationary models resulting from string theory @xcite such as brane inflation @xcite .",
    "moreover , cosmic strings seem to be a generic prediction of supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite and grand unified based inflationary models @xcite . even though the origin of these cosmic superstrings is string theory , their properties can be investigated in the framework of field theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the influence of gravity on field theoretical cosmic superstrings has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the field theoretical model typically used to study cosmic ( super)strings is the abelian - higgs model , which was shown to possess string - like solutions @xcite .",
    "this model contains a complex scalar field minimally coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern of this model is @xmath1 1 and is supposed to be a toy model for the formation of strings in grand unified theories .",
    "the gravitational field of an abelian - higgs string was also studied @xcite and it was shown that next to standard string solutions so - called `` melvin '' solutions exist that possess a different asymptotic behaviour of the metric functions .    the interaction of two abelian - higgs strings via their magnetic fields has been studied @xcite .",
    "it was shown that bound states can form and that a new bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) bound @xcite exists for particular choices of the coupling constants in the model .    since cosmic ( super)strings are a prediction of string theory and grand unified theories",
    "it would be exciting to detect these objects .",
    "there has been considerable effort in numerically modeling cosmic string networks to obtain cmb power and polarization spectra @xcite .",
    "comparison with observations has shown that cosmic strings might well contribute considerably to the energy density of the universe . in this paper",

    "string space - times has been used to suggest cosmic string candidates @xcite . the test particle motion in different space - times containing cosmic strings has been investigated in @xcite , while the complete set of orbits of test particles in the space - time of a black hole pierced by an infinitely thin cosmic string has been given for a schwarzschild black hole in @xcite and for a kerr black hole in @xcite . moreover , the geodesic motion of test particles in field theoretical cosmic string space - times has been given for abelian - higgs strings in @xcite and for cosmic superstrings in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are aiming at studying the motion of test particles in the space - time of two abelian - higgs strings that form bound states by interacting via their magnetic fields .",
    "note that the form of interaction considered here has been used in the description of new theoretical models of the dark matter sector @xcite .",
    "the bound states of two abelian - higgs strings can be thought of as a field theoretical realization of cosmic superstrings , so - called p - q - strings . in the original field",

    ". however , in these models there are no bound states that fulfill the bps limit .",
    "this is different in our model , where a bps state exists for certain values of the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section ii we give the field theoretical model describing dark strings interacting with cosmic strings as well as the geodesic equations describing test particle motion in the space - time of these strings . in section",
    "iii we present our numerical results and we conclude in section iv .",
    "the field theoretical model to describe the interaction of a dark string with a cosmic string reads @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar and @xmath4 is newton s constant .",
    "the matter lagrangian @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 with the covariant derivatives @xmath7 = @xmath8 - @xmath9 , @xmath10 = @xmath11 - @xmath12 of the two complex scalar field @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath21 denotes the gravitational covariant derivative .",
    "finally , the potential @xmath22 reads : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the self - couplings of the two scalar fields . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath28 is the interaction term @xcite .",
    "we will assume that @xmath29 hence considering bound states of cosmic strings .    in the following , we associate the dark string to the fields @xmath17 and @xmath13 , while the cosmic strings are described by the fields @xmath30 and @xmath14 .",
    "the higgs fields have masses @xmath31 , while the gauge boson masses are @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "note that the lagrangian describes effectively two coupled abelian  higgs models .",
    "the most general static cylindrically symmetric line element invariant under boosts along the @xmath34-direction is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are functions of @xmath38 only .",

    ", we have : @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 are integers indexing the vorticity of the two higgs fields around the @xmath45axis .",
    "the magnetic fields associated to the solution can be given when noting that the gauge part of the lagrangian density can be rewritten as follows @xcite : @xmath46 with @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the magnetic fields associated to the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 have only a component in @xmath34-direction .",

    "the potential now reads : @xmath72    these equations have to be solved numerically subject to appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we require the solution to be regular at @xmath73 which implies @xmath74 for the matter fields and @xmath75 for the metric fields .",

    "for this , we rewrite the geodesic equation in the form @xmath109    the solution for each component can then be calculated as a function of @xmath38 by using numerical integration methods .",
    "the solutions to the equations ( [ eq1])-([eq7 ] ) are only known numerically .",
    "we have solved these equations using the ode solver colsys @xcite .",
    "the solutions have relative errors on the order of @xmath110 .",
    "the solution corresponds to two abelian - higgs strings interacting via their magnetic fields in curved space - time and has been studied in detail in @xcite . in the following we will set @xmath111 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated numerically in fortran using the fortran subroutines for mathematical applications ",
    "imsl math / library .",
    "the accuracy of the integration as estimated from application of the method for the integration of geodesics in schwarzschild space - time is on the order of @xmath112 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ geo1 ] ) and ( [ effective_pot ] ) that we need to require @xmath113 in order to find orbits .",
    "in addition the values of @xmath38 for which @xmath114 correspond to the turning points of the motion . for @xmath115 the effective potential tends to infinity for @xmath116 .",
    "physically this corresponds to an infinite potential barrier resulting from the angular momentum of the particle .",
    "as such the test particle can never reach the string axis @xmath73 for @xmath115 . for @xmath117 on the other hand , the potential has a finite value at @xmath73 and if @xmath118 is greater than this value the particles can reach the string axis .",
    "asymptotically the potential tends to @xmath119 .      in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for a general cosmic string space ",
    "time with topology @xmath120 massless test particles must move on geodesics that escape to infinity in both directions , i.e. bound orbits of massless test particles are not possible .",
    "the assumption made in @xcite is that @xmath121 must have positive gaussian curvature . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was shown that in the space - time of abelian - higgs strings and cosmic superstrings , respectively , this is even true if @xmath121 has negative gaussian curvature close to the string axis . in the appendix",
    "we give a general proof that the effective potential can not have local extrema in this case and hence bound orbits are not possible .",
    "we do nt present any plots of the effective potential here since it is simply monotonically decreasing ( for @xmath115 ) or constant ( for @xmath117 ) .",
    "in contrast to massless test particles we expect massive test particles to be able to move on bound orbits around the cosmic strings . that this is possible for _ finite width _",
    "cosmic strings was shown in @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate in the following that this is also possible in our model .",
    "bound orbits possess two turning points and we need hence to require that the potential should not be monotonically decreasing on the full @xmath38 interval , but have local extrema . remembering that @xmath122 it is obvious from the form of the potential that solutions to @xmath123 exist only if @xmath124 .",
    "for @xmath125 the two abelian - higgs strings do not interact directly . as mentioned above ,",
    "geodesic motion in the space - time of an abelian - higgs string has been studied in @xcite and it was found that bound orbits of massive particles are only possible if the higgs boson mass is smaller than the gauge boson mass or equivalently if the scalar core of the string is larger than the core of the corresponding flux tube since in that case @xmath124 . if the higgs boson mass is equal ( larger ) than the gauge boson mass it was found that @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) . hence the effective potential does not have local extrema and bound orbits are not possible .",
    "this changes if one couples the two abelian - higgs models via a potential interaction term @xcite . in this present paper ,",
    "the two sectors interact via the magnetic fields of the cosmic strings . in analogy to",
    "@xcite we are hence first interested to see whether bound orbits exist also when the radii of the flux and scalar cores are equal , i.e. for @xmath128 . in fig.[c1pots ] we show the effective potential for massive test particles ( @xmath129 ) with @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 for different values of the angular momentum @xmath94 with linear momentum @xmath133 .",
    "for vanishing angular momentum ( see fig.[c1_pot1 ] ) we find that the angular momentum barrier at @xmath73 disappears and the particle moves from infinity to the string axis on a terminating escape orbit if @xmath134 is larger than the asymptotic value of the effective potential ( a ) or on a terminating orbit if @xmath134 is smaller than the asymptotic value ( b ) , respectively ( see also table  [ typesoforbits1 ] for the classification of these orbits ) .",
    "for non - vanishing angular momentum we find that for some range of @xmath94 bound orbits exist .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[c1_pot12 ] for @xmath135 , where for @xmath134 smaller than the asymptotic value of the effective potential only a bound orbit ( d ) exists , while for @xmath134 larger than the asymptotic value only an escape orbit ( e ) is present .",
    "increasing @xmath94 further ( fig.[c1_pot2 ] for @xmath136 ) we find that an escape orbit and a bound orbit exist ( c ) for the same value of @xmath134 if this value is larger than the asymptotic value of the effective potential , but smaller than the local maximum . for @xmath134 larger than the local maximum ,",
    "only an escape orbit is possible ( e ) .",
    "the effective potential possesses local extrema such that for @xmath134 larger than the minimum of the potential and smaller than the maximum of the potential there are three turning points and bound orbits as well as escape orbits exist . for larger values of @xmath94 ( see fig.[c1_pot3 ] )",
    "the local extrema have disappeared and only escape orbits exist .",
    "hence , we conclude that the interaction between the cosmic strings leads to the existence of bound orbits .",

    "clearly , the potential possesses local extrema and we can choose the energy such that up to three turning points exist and hence bound orbits are possible .    for @xmath142 , @xmath143 bound orbits exist already for @xmath125 @xcite . for @xmath144 and @xmath142 , @xmath145 the effective potential",

    "again we observe that increasing the angular momentum from zero , the potential starts to form local extrema such that bound orbits can exist .",

    "the plot is not changing : the types of orbits are preserved and the graph is moving upwards .",
    "next we have investigated how the windings influence our results . here , we want to put the emphasize on two strings with opposite windings and hence oppositely orientated magnetic fields interacting with each other .",
    "our results for the effective potential in the case @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath132 are shown in fig.[c7pots ] . to compare",
    ", we also plotted the potential for @xmath149 , @xmath152 , @xmath151 and @xmath132 and the same values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 in fig.[c4pot_lz2=0.0005 ] ( cf .",
    "fig.[c7_pot2 ] )",
    ". there seems to be no qualitative difference between the plots for negative and positive windings , which can also be noted when plotting the corresponding orbits ( see next section ) .",
    "however , we expect that the winding would effect the orbits of charged test particles .",
    "this assumption comes from the analogy with the motion of charged particles in the field in charged reissner - nordstrm black - hole  @xcite , where the cross - interaction between the electric and magnetic charges of the test particles and the gravitating source tear the test particle from the equatorial plane and make it move on a cone .",
    "this is currently under investigation .",
    "+    to conclude we observe that cosmic strings interacting via their magnetic fields can capture test particles on bound orbits if the energy and angular momentum of the test particle is not too large . we also observe that increasing the value of @xmath28 we have to increase the value of @xmath153 by the same order of magnitude to find bound orbits .",
    "e.g. for @xmath154 we find that bound orbits exist for @xmath153 on the order of @xmath155 .",
    "example of orbits for massless test particles is presented in fig.[photon_orb1 ] . as expected",
    "there are no bound orbits .",
    "we observe that the test particle encircles the string before moving off again to infinity .",
    "this is not possible in the case of infinitely thin cosmic strings and is due to the finite width of the core of the string . for @xmath156 and @xmath157 in the fig.s[null1 ] , the turning point of the motion is closer to the string axis as for @xmath158 and @xmath159 in the fig.s[null3 ] , .",
    "hence the particle can interact stronger with the cosmic string via the curvature of space - time .",
    "+      we show the orbits corresponding to the potentials in fig.[c1pots ] in fig.s [ c1pots_orbits]-[c1pots_orbits3 ] for different values of @xmath105 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath160 ( see fig.[c1_pot2 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath161 we have a bound and an escape orbit .",
    "these are shown in fig.s [ c1_pot2_orbe2_5.000146b]- [ c1_pot2_orbe2_5.000146b_3d ] and fig.s [ c1_pot2_orbe2_5.000146e]-[c1_pot2_orbe2_5.000146e_3d ] , respectively .",

    "we plot the bound orbit for @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 in the space - time of two abelian - higgs strings with @xmath149 , @xmath152 @xmath151 and @xmath132 in fig.s [ c4_pot2_orbe2_5.01b]- [ c4_pot2_orbe2_5.01b_3d ] . comparing this with fig.[c7pots_orbits ]",
    "we find that the direction of the magnetic flux ( which is given by the choice of signature of the windings ) does nt influence the motion strongly .",
    "the only difference is that the perihelion shift seems to be smaller for both windings positive .",
    "the perihelion shift and light deflection of massive and massless test particles , respectively , has been studied in the space - time of field theoretical cosmic string solutions previously @xcite . since",
    "our model is similar , we believe that the qualitative results for these two observables will be comparable . in this present paper , we hence concentrate on the computation of the minimal radius of escape orbits of massless test particles as well as the minimal and maximal radius of bound orbits .",
    "the former has application in the detection of cosmic strings by light deflection , while in the latter we argue that the radii of bound orbits are on the order of the inverse gauge boson mass .",
    "the first thing to note is that the minimal and maximal radius of the bound orbits are close to unity ( in rescaled variables ) ( see e.g. fig.[c1_pot2_orbe2_5.000134b ] ) .",
    "reinstalling units , we find that the minimal and maximal radius , respectively are on the order of the inverse gauge boson mass @xmath185 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath186 we find that one unit of rescaled @xmath38 corresponds to length scales of @xmath187 . hence , the orbits have extremely small extend and are thus not interesting for applications in the context of motion of massive objects such as planets in the solar system or beyond .",
    "however , the fact that cosmic strings can trap massive test particles that move close to or inside their core might have interesting cosmological applications ( see discussion below ) .",
    "massless test particles such as photons can only move on escape orbits , i.e. they get deflected by the string .",
    "while the cosmic strings have very small width in comparison to their lengths and one would at first think that only the global deficit angle governs the deflection of light , it was shown already in @xcite that the microscopical structure of the field configuration has an influence on the observables .",
    "it was e.g. found that massless particles do not simply get deflected by the string , but can encircle it before moving off again to infinity .",
    "this does not happen for infinitely thin cosmic strings . in fig.[rmin_escape",
    "] we show the radius of closest approach @xmath188 of a massless test particle moving on an escape orbit in dependence on the interaction parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the radius of closest approach is again on the order of unity in rescaled variables , i.e. corresponds to length scales of approximately @xmath189 .",
    "we observe that the smaller @xmath28 the smaller is @xmath188 , i.e. the deeper the test particle can penetrate into the string core .",
    "the question is then whether there are any cosmological or astrophysical phenomena observable from these interactions of massive and massless test particles with cosmic strings . as mentioned above , the most obvious observation that has already been discussed extensively before",
    "is the deflection of light .",
    "here we want to point out that the motion of massive and massless test particles can lead to the emission of radiation , in particular gravitational radiation .",
    "the emission of scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational radiation , respectively from test particles moving in the space - time of an infinitely thin cosmic string was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the emitted gravitational radiation power @xmath190 of a non - relativistic point particle moving in the space - time of an infinitely thin cosmic string is given by @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the emitted energy , @xmath193 the interaction time of the particle with the string , @xmath194 the mass of the test particle and @xmath195 its velocity .",
    "finally @xmath196 with @xmath197 the energy per unit length of the string . now assuming that we have a massive test particle moving on a nearly circular orbit with radius @xmath188 and hence @xmath198 for one revolution of the particle around the string , we find the emitted power per revolution : @xmath199 and @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the number of revolutions around the string .    now assuming that @xmath202 and @xmath203 we find @xmath204 for non - relativistic point - like , i.e. elementary particle this number is quite small , however , since the particle moves on a bound orbit it will encircle the string many times and",
    "hence the emitted gravitational radiation can become significant if @xmath36 becomes very large .    in @xcite the formula for a relativistic point particle",
    "was also given .",
    "this reads @xmath205 with the lorentz factor @xmath206 . again assuming the particle to move on a bound orbit we find the emitted power per revolution to be @xmath207 considering e.g. an electron with @xmath208 moving close to the speed of light , i.e. @xmath209 we find that @xmath210 @xmath211 should be very large to have a significant effect here , however , since the particle is moving in a bound orbit around the string , the total emitted power could be quite large .",
    "since the advent of inflationary models rooted in string theory such as brane inflation it has been suggested that cosmic strings are indeed a `` by - produced '' of inflation and should hence exist in the universe .",
    "while the presence of cosmic strings in our universe would show up in the cmb data ( power and polarization spectrum ) it would be very exciting indeed to observe these objects directly .",
    "since the width of these topological defects is much smaller than their extension it is often assumed that they are effectively 1-dimensional .",
    "consequently , the nambu - goto action can be used to describe these objects in a so - called `` macroscopic description '' .",
    "the advantage is that calculations related to the dynamics of these objects are feasible , however one does nt get inside into the underlying field theoretical models . using the latter in the so - called `` microscopic description '' however has the disadvantage that even for the simplest models the solutions have to be constructed numerically . there have been claims that certain gravitational lensing effects might be due to cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "this however turned out to be simply a pair of nearly - identical objects and as such cosmic strings are as yet to be detected .",
    "we suggest in this paper that this can be done by the observation of the motion of massive test particles close to the string core or by the observation of gravitational lensing , i.e. the motion of massless particles in the gravitational field of a cosmic string . while in the microscopic description of cosmic strings the space - time is locally flat with a global deficit angle and hence geodesics are just straight lines , this is different for the microscopic description . in that case , bound orbits of massive test particles are possible @xcite .",
    "this is also what we show here .",
    "the cosmic strings interact via their magnetic fields and we show that the attractive interaction allows for bound orbits that are not possible without the interaction .",
    "this was also observed in @xcite .",
    "our model has the new feature that the bound states have a bps limit in which they satisfy an equality between their energy per unit lengths and their winding numbers .",
    "bps states of interacting cosmic strings are of great interest with respect to the original supersymmetric p - q - strings appearing in string theory .",
    "since our test particles are point - like , i.e. have no internal structure they interact solely with the gravitational field ( and hence move on geodesics )",
    ". it would be interesting to see what would happen to charged particles or particles with spin .",
    "certainly there will be an effect related to the interaction with the magnetic field along the cosmic string axis .",
    "one might consider to compute the electromagnetic and gravitational radiation from this which would put strong constraints on the energy per unit length of the cosmic strings .",
    "this is currently under investigation .",
    "b.h . thanks the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) for financial support under grant ha-4426/5 - 1 .",
    "v.k . thanks the dfg for financial support .",
    "we also gratefully acknowledge support within the framework of the dfg research training group 1620 _ models of gravity_. bh would like to thank f. michel for bringing reference @xcite to her attention .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in a general cosmic string space - time with topology @xmath120 bound orbits of massless test particles can not exist .",
    "the assumption used in the proof is that @xmath121 has positive gaussian curvature .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that in the space - time of an abelian - higgs string @xmath121 can have negative gaussian curvature close to the string axis and hence the theorem does not apply there . here",
    "we show that for our model bound orbits of massless test particles are indeed not possible . in order to have bound orbits we need ( at least ) two turning points with @xmath212 . since the effective potential @xmath213 for @xmath115 ( we will discuss the case @xmath117 separately ) and @xmath214 , we need to require that @xmath215 has local extrema in order to be able to find ( at least ) two turning points .",
    "hence @xmath123 for some @xmath216 . for @xmath217 and @xmath218",
    "this leads to @xmath219 taking the derivative and using ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) we find for @xmath220 @xmath221 now , since @xmath222 , @xmath223 ( both functions monotonically decrease for @xmath43 , @xmath44 at @xmath73 to zero at infinity , see ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) ) we find that for @xmath224 ( [ condition ] ) can never be fulfilled . for @xmath217 and @xmath225",
    "the potential is constant @xmath226 .",
    "hence the potential can not have local extrema and we conclude that bound orbits of massless test particles are not possible .",
    "note that our model includes also the case of ordinary abelian - higgs strings ( for @xmath125 ) that was previously studied in @xcite as well as the case of abelian - higgs strings interacting via their potential that has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the latter applies because the field potential ( [ potential_scaled ] ) drops out when combining ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "hence , even if direct interaction terms between the scalar fields would be considered in the potential they would nt effect the argument above .",
