    "systems involving particles with 2-body interactions at or close to the unitary limit have become of specific interest in the physics community during the last several years for reasons that have repeatedly been pointed out in numerous publications related to both atomic and sub - atomic problems .",
    "the unitary limit is here defined as being that for which the scattering length @xmath8 and effective range @xmath9 are infinite and zero respectively . in that case the only scale left in a system of fermions of infinite extension would be the fermi - momentum . the total energy would then have to be proportional to the fermi - energy as that is the only scale left in this problem .",
    "experimental results point to @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the kinetic energy of the unperturbed kinetic energy of the system .",
    "theoretical determination of the this universal constant is a many - body problem .",
    "it should however only involve some simple constants and might _ a ' priori seem straightforward .",
    "it has however been found to be a theoretical challenge .",
    "some calculations of the author using brueckner methods show for example a very strong dependence on the effective range @xmath9 .",
    "there is also in any theoretial calculation a necessary cut - off @xmath2 in momentum - space that renders the 2-body interaction a function of this @xmath2 .",
    "this does introduce another length parameter into the theory . in the previous work of the author , and",
    "shown below , the rank-1 separable interaction is in the unitary limit singular at the momentum @xmath2 .",
    "this fact introduces another problem ; the applicability of a many - body theory in this limit .",
    "the applicability of the bruckner method was for example questioned after the realisation of the very large correlations and consequently , `` wound - integral '' in this case .",
    "the `` model '' space represented by a zero - temperature fermi distribution is no longer adequate",
    ". a green s function method including spectral broadening would be more appropriate . _    as opposed to the infinite system the three - body system is exactly solvable by the faddeev method @xcite .",
    "it therefore presents a more interesting project for a numerical study with interactions at and near the unitary limit .",
    "of specific interest here is also the phenomena first brought to the attention by vitali efimov .",
    "@xcite he found the surprising fact that bosons interacting with a resonance in the 2-body state ( i.e. @xmath12 ) would result in a strongly bound three - body system _ and with a spectrum of loosely bound excited states .",
    "_    the inverse scattering method as applied here uses two - body on - shell data ( scattering length and effective range ) as input .",
    "although on - shell properties of the t - matrix are fitted exactly , many - body calculations involve also off - shell t - matrix elements .",
    "these are not derivable from experimental two - body data.so even if a rank-1 potential is sufficient to fit the on - shell data as is often the case it leaves the off - shell undetermined .",
    "the extension to a rank-2 will allow for a phase - shift equivalent interaction with different off - shell t - matrix elements .",
    "this provides a practical tool for exploring off - shell or equivalently , three - body effects .",
    "this method will be used in some cases below .",
    "it was used by the author in earlier work .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) the on - shell data relate to the asymptotic form of the two - body scattering wave - function .",
    "these have to be preserved when increasing the rank which implies that the interaction should be modified at short range in coordinate space as shown below .    in the present report we focus only on the ground and efimov state energies , as well as on the dependence on scattering lengths and effective ranges and on the questions of convergence as a function of cut - off in momentum - space .    in section 2",
    "is found a presentation of the necessary tools which are the faddeev equation and the inverse scattering method .",
    "section 3 show results of numerical calculations in 3 subsections wth 8 figures .",
    "section 4 is a summary and some discussion of the results .",
    "the faddeev three - boson equation for a spin - independent rank-1 separable attractive potential @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15    the extension to the rank-2 potentials used below in section 3.2 is straight - forward .",
    "@xcite    the separable interactions are calculated from phase - shifts by an inverse scattering method that dates back at least some 40 years .",
    "@xcite some recent applications by the author can be found in refs where details can be found.@xcite where some details of the method are also shown .",
    "the input are phase - shifts which in general can be either experimental or otherwise defined . for the purpose of this investigation",
    "they will be defined by a scattering length @xmath8 and and an effective range @xmath9 .",
    "a rank-1 separable potential is then sufficient to reproduce the input phase - shifts exactly .",
    "( if the phase - shift were to changes sign such as in the nuclear @xmath16 case a rank two potential is necessary .",
    "@xcite ) . as mentioned above a higher rank may be required in order to accomodate three - body data .",
    "the present work is not specific to any particular system other than that the 2-body interaction is close to the unitary limit for which universality would apply .",
    "it is shown however that an off - shell correction ( three - body force ) via a rank-2 potential can be used to prevent the ultraviolet divergence and collapse of the three - boson system in that limit .    in the case of a rank-1 attractive",
    "potential one has    @xmath17    inverse scattering then yields ( e.g. ref @xcite )    @xmath18    where @xmath19 \\label{d}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the principal value and @xmath21 are the phaseshifts .",
    "@xmath2 provides a cut - off in momentum - space and the interaction is fully defined by the phase - shifts , the two - body binding energy @xmath22 and by @xmath2 .",
    "the effect of the cut - off will be exploited below .",
    "@xmath22 is calculated from @xmath23 it is set to zero for unbound states .    for the rank-2 potentials that are used in sect .",
    "3.2 the method of chadan and fiedeldey was applied.@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this",
    "a set of initial phaseshifts is assumed to be provided .",
    "an arbitrary interaction @xmath24 , is then assumed , defined either by another set of phases or explicitly . a second potential , @xmath25",
    "can then be constructed so that the rank-2 potential given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 reproduce the initial phases .",
    "if the initial phases are , as in our case below , all of the same sign , they can be reproduced by a rank-1 potential from eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) .",
    "the extension to a rank-2 potential , allows for an arbitrary change of off - shell behaviour or in other words of the three - body term while preserving the fit to the initial two - body phase - shifts .    with @xmath26 , the unitary limit",
    ", these phases can be reproduced by a rank one - potential and one finds ( e.g.@xcite )    @xmath27    where the factor @xmath28 ( @xmath29 in the unitary limit ) is introduced for later presentation of results where the three - boson binding is calculated as a function of this strength factor .",
    "note that @xmath30 @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "note also that for @xmath33 one finds @xmath34 in this limit , _ but only in this limit , the unitary interaction will then be a @xmath35-function in coordinate space with the strength inversely proportional to the cut - off .",
    "but eq . ( [ vpi2 ] ) shows that a finite @xmath2 results in an abrupt increase in strength and a singularity at @xmath36 to preserve the condition @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . _    with the interaction ( [ vpi2 ] ) and with the momenta in units of the cut - off @xmath2 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) the faddeev equation is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath43 is after a change of variables @xmath44 $ ] given by @xmath45    note that any interaction for which @xmath46 would result in a similar universal equation with @xmath47 .",
    "it is also important to note that with @xmath48 and @xmath49 one finds @xmath50 for @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "this leads to a reactance matrix element @xmath53 i.e. @xmath26 for @xmath54 which is the condition for a unitary interaction with a cut - off @xmath2 in momentum - space .",
    "the associated resonance is of course also the origin og the efimov - states in the three - body system .",
    "the number of such states were predicted to be@xcite @xmath55    the problem with the renormalisation of the three - boson system ( i.e. the @xmath56 divergence ) was addressed by bedaque , hammer and van kolck.@xcite they resolve it by introducing a three - body counter - term .",
    "here this is done by extending the rank-1 potential to a rank-2 by the method described above .",
    "the arbitrary interaction @xmath24 is defined by repulsive phases @xmath57 , @xmath58 being the relative momentum and @xmath59 a constant determined below .",
    "this simulates a short - ranged repulsion which effectively removes the ultra - violet divergence experienced with the rank-1 potential .",
    "the off - shell t - matrix elements in the faddeev equation are affected by this modification of the interaction with results shown below .",
    "the energy of the three - boson system was calculated by solving the faddeev equation numerically either by iteration or by matrix diagonalisation in the conventional fashion .",
    "the separable interaction was obtained by the inverse scattering method referred to above for a range of scattering lengths and effective ranges including the unitary limit , in the results presented below the energies are in units of @xmath60 and the lengths in units of @xmath61 , but are in general universal .",
    "it was verified numerically that the quantity @xmath62 , defined above , is independent of the cut - off @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath28 for the ground state is shown in fig .",
    "[ eff6 ] with @xmath63 ( i.e. the unitary limit ) while @xmath64 for @xmath65 with a nearly linear dependence on @xmath28 .",
    "[ eff ] shows the energy as a function of @xmath66 for three chosen values of effective ranges @xmath9 .",
    "one notices a very strong dependence on the effective range .",
    "[ eff5 ] shows energies @xmath1 as a function of cut - off @xmath2 for @xmath67 and some selected values of effective ranges @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown above that for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , i.e. the unitary limit , @xmath69 .",
    "this is shown numerically by the curve labelled `` .0 '' .",
    "the figure shows that the convergence with @xmath2 improves as the effective - range is increased . the value of @xmath70 at which the asymptotic value is reached scales roughly as @xmath71 .",
    "the size of the three - boson system in momentum - space scales roughly the same , consistent with that the size in coordinate space would be @xmath72 . fig .",
    "[ eff7 ] shows the rms radius @xmath73 of the @xmath74 function .",
    "it follows    closely the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ eff5 ] .. this is a general characteristic of any energy vs size display . ]",
    "one concludes that the size of the system ( in momentum - space ) determines the minimum range @xmath75 of momenta that the interaction has to span .",
    "this is analogous to the situation found in nuclear matter brueckner calculations where the minimum cut - off is found to be @xmath76 i.e. twice the fermi - momemtum .",
    "@xcite in the present work on the three - boson system we also find , quite naturally , that @xmath73 is inversely proportinal to @xmath9 .",
    "this is a difference from the brueckner calculations where the effect of correlations on the momentum distribution is ignored and approximated by the non - interacting fermi - distribution .",
    "this is an approximation related to the quasi - particle approximation which is implicit in the brueckner method .",
    "the green s function approach goes beyond this approximation including the finite width of the spectral - functions and the momentum - distribution is then wider .",
    "the renormalisation of the non - relativstic three - body problem with short ranged forces was addressed by bedaque et al@xcite . as shown above",
    ", the three - boson system with the two - body unitary interaction ( [ vpi2 ] ) collapses as @xmath56 .",
    "bedaque et al suggests to introduce a three - body counterterm for the renormalisation .",
    "one may alternatively choose to introduce a similar counterterm by changing the off - shell two - body t - matrix .",
    "as alreday announced in sect 2 this is done by replacing the rank-1 by a rank-2 interaction with @xmath24 chosen so as to modify the short - ranged , ultraviolet , part of the interaction in order to prevent the collapse . with @xmath57 the related potential @xmath24",
    "is obtained by inverse scattering .",

    "the lowest curve is for @xmath77 i.e. the rank-1 potential and shows the @xmath56 divergence .",
    "the upper five curves are for increasing values of @xmath59 as shown in the figure caption .",
    "a drastic change is seen with @xmath78 showing convergence for large @xmath2 .",
    "there are many publications related to the low - bound excited states found as solutions of the faddeev equations , states first discoverd by and named after vitali efimov@xcite numerous calculations were done at and close to the unitary limit .",
    "never was found more than one state that could be identified as an efimov state although eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) suggests several states should be found with @xmath79 .",
    "the search for these states was in general very elusive and in particular very sensitive to very small changes in the low momenta part of the interactions .",
