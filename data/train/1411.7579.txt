    "for a long time quantum entanglement was only of philosophical interest and researchers were mainly focusing on addressing the questions that were related with the quantum mechanical understanding of various fundamental notions like reality and locality @xcite .",
    "however , for the last two decades world had seen that quantum entanglement is not only a philosophical riddle but also a reality as far as the laboratory preparation of entangled qubits are concerned @xcite .",
    "researches that were conducted during these decades were not all concerned about its existence but mostly about its usefulness as a resource to carry out information processing protocols like quantum teleportation @xcite , cryptography @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , and in many other tasks @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently evident from various followed up investigations that quantum entanglement plays a pivotal role in all these information processing protocols .",
    "therefore , understanding the precise nature of entanglement in bipartite and multiparty quantum systems has become the holy - grail of quantum information processing .",
    "however , the precise role of entanglement as a resource in quantum information processing is not fully understood and it was suggested that entanglement is not the only type of correlation present in quantum states . this is because lately some computational tasks were carried out even in the absence of entanglement @xcite .",
    "this provided the foundation to the belief that there may be correlation present in the system even in the absence of entanglement .",
    "hence , researchers redefined quantum correlation from the information theoretic perspective .",
    "this gave rise to various measures @xcite of quantum correlation , the predominant of them being quantum discord @xcite .",
    "though there are issues that need to be addressed , in much deeper level quantum discord temporarily satisfies certain relevant questions .",
    "subsequently , quantum discord has been given an operational interpretation in different contexts like quantum state merging @xcite and remote state preparation @xcite .",
    "in addition , extension of the notion of quantum discord to multi qubit cases has been proposed @xcite .",
    "many works were done in the recent past to investigate the dynamics of quantum correlation in open systems by comparing the evolution of different types of initial states in specific models .",
    "these states are typically two qubits coupled with two local baths or one common bath . in principle , there are several factors that can affect the evolution , namely , the initial state for the system and environment , the type of system - environment interaction and the structure of the reservoir",
    ". a more relevant question will be how robust are these measures when they are subjected to the noise in quantum channels .",
    "it is mainly inspired by the studies of sudden death of entanglement for two qubits , having no direct interaction @xcite .",
    "entanglement sudden death ( esd ) is said to occur when the initial entanglement falls and remains at zero after a finite period of evolution for some choices of the initial state .",
    "esd is a potential threat to quantum algorithms and quantum information protocols and thus the quantum systems should be well protected against noisy environments .",
    "another possible way to circumvent such resource vanishing is to make use of resources which do not suffer from sudden death . at this point",
    ", one can ask a similar question : _ does quantum discord present similar behavior ? _ in the first study @xcite addressing this question , researchers have compared the evolution of concurrence and discord for two qubits , each subject to independent markovian decoherence ( dephasing , depolarizing and amplitude damping ) .",
    "looking at initial states such as werner states and partially - entangled pure states , the authors find no sudden death of discord even when esd does occur ; quantum discord decays exponentially and vanishes asymptotically in all cases .",
    "however , not much is known about the effects on multipartite correlation with time when they are transferred through noisy quantum channels .    in this work ,",
    "we study the dynamics of quantum dissension of three qubit states which happens to be a measure of multi party quantum correlation , under the effect of various quantum noisy channels .",
    "in addition , we also study the dynamics of monogamy score of these three qubit states in presence of channel noise . in section 2 ,",
    "we provide a detail descriptions of quantum dissension and monogamy score of quantum correlation . in section 3",
    ", we study the effect of various noisy channels on quantum correlation and monogamy score when all the qubits are transferred through them .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 4 by discussing future directions of explorations .",
    "in classical information theory @xcite , the total correlation between two random variables is defined by their mutual information .",
    "if x and y are two random variables , the mutual information is obtained by subtracting the joint entropy of the system from the sum of the individual entropies .",
    "mathematically , this can be stated as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 defines shannon entropy function .    another equivalent way of expressing mutual information is by taking into account the reduction in uncertainty associated with one random variable due to the introduction of another random variable .",
    "stated formally as , @xmath2 or @xmath3 where @xmath4 defines conditional entropy of @xmath5 given that @xmath6 has already occurred and vice versa .",
    "all these above expressions are equivalent in classical information theory .",
    "when we try to quantify correlation in quantum systems from an information theoretic perspective , natural extension of these quantities will be obtained by replacing random variables with density matrices , shannon entropy with von neumann entropy and apposite definition of the conditional entropies . stated mathematically , the quantum mutual information is given by , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the composite density matrix , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the local density matrices and @xmath11 defines von neumann entropy function .",
    "similarly , by applying the argument of reduction of uncertainty associated with one quantum system with introduction of another quantum system , one can have the alternative definition of mutual information as , @xmath12 and @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the average of conditional entropy and is obtained after carrying out a projective measurement on subsystem @xmath6 and vice versa .",
    "the projective measurement is done in the general basis @xmath15 = cos@xmath16 + @xmath17 sin@xmath18 , @xmath19 = sin@xmath16 - @xmath17 cos@xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 have the range [ 0,2@xmath23 .",
    "hence , the quantum conditional entropy can be expressed as , @xmath14 = @xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] , ( @xmath26 being identity operator on the hilbert space of the quantum system @xmath5 ) , gives the probability of obtaining the @xmath27the outcome . the corresponding post - measurement state of system @xmath5 is @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note over here that @xmath29 is different from what will be the straightforward extension of classical conditional entropy . in quantum information ,",
    "the meaning of conditional entropy of the qubit @xmath5 given that @xmath6 has occurred is the amount of uncertainty in the qubit @xmath5 given that a measurement is carried out on the qubit @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , the expressions @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not equivalent in the quantum domain .",
    "the differences between @xmath33 and @xmath34 are captured by quantum discord i.e. @xmath35 @xmath36 one variant of quantum discord is the geometric quantum discord which is defined as the distance between a quantum state and the nearest classical ( or separable ) state , @xcite .",
    "quantum discord has been established as a non - negative measure of correlation for any quantum states .",
    "subsequent researches were carried out to obtain an analytical closed form of quantum discord and was found for certain class of states @xcite . an unified geometric view of quantum correlations which includes discord , entanglement along with the introduction of the concepts like quantum dissonance was given in @xcite .",
    "one of the natural extension of quantum discord from two qubit to three qubit systems is quantum dissension @xcite .",
    "introduction of three qubits naturally brings in one and two - particle projective measurement into consideration .",
    "these measurements can be performed on different subsystems leading to multiple definitions of quantum dissension . in other words",
    "a single quantity is not sufficient enough to capture all aspects of correlation in multiparty systems .",
    "quantum dissension in this context can be interpreted as a vector quantity with values of correlation rising because of multiple definitions as various components . however , in principle when we define correlation in multi qubit situations , measurement in one subsystem can enhance the correlation in other two subsystems and thereby making quantum dissension to assume negative values @xcite .",
    "we emphasize on all possible one - particle projective measurements and two - particle projective measurements .",

    "monogamy of quantum correlation is an unique phenomenon which addresses distributed correlation in a multiparty setting .",
    "it states that in a multipartite situation , the total amount of individual correlations of a single party with other parties is bounded by the amount of correlation shared by the same party with the rest of the system when the rest are considered as a single entity .",
    "mathematically , given a multipartite quantum state @xmath71 shared between n parties , the monogamy condition for a bipartite correlation measure @xmath72 should satisfy @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 = @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "it had been shown that certain entanglement measures satisfy the monogamy inequality .",
    "however , there are certain measures of quantum correlation , including quantum discord , which behave differently as far as the satisfying of monogamy inequality is concerned . by the term violation of monogamy inequality for certain measure",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of quantum dissension for three qubit states in various dissipative channels such as amplitude damping , dephasing and depolarizing . our study is solely based on markovian environments where quantum channels are without memory and each qubit </S>",
    "<S> is coupled to its own environment . </S>",
    "<S> we start with mixed ghz , mixed w , mixture of separable states , a mixed biseparable state , as the initial states and mostly observe that the decay of quantum dissension is asymptotic in contrast to sudden death of quantum entanglement in similar environments . </S>",
    "<S> this is a clear indication of the fact that quantum correlation in general is more robust against the effect of noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a given class of initial mixed states we find a temporary leap in quantum dissension for a certain interval of time . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we observe the revival of quantum correlation to happen for certain time period . </S>",
    "<S> this signifies that the measure of quantum correlation such as quantum discord , quantum dissension , defined from the information theoretic perspective is different from the correlation defined from the entanglement - separability paradigm and can increase under the effect of the local noise . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effects of these channels on the monogamy score of each of these initial states . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that for certain class of states and channels , there is change from negative values to positive values of the monogamy score with classical randomness as well as with time . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us an important insight in obtaining states which are freely sharable ( polygamous state ) from the states which are not freely sharable ( monogamous ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed a remarkable feature , as we can create monogamous states from polygamous states monogamous states are considered to have more signatures of quantum ness and can be used for security purpose . </S>"
