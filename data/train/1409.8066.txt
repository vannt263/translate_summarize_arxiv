    "topological insulators have been fascinating both from the fundamental physical and applied technological points of view . while the bulk of a d - dimensional topological insulator ( ti ) , almost similar to any other band insulator is gapped , ( d-1)-dimensional gapless states emerge on its surfaces or edges  @xcite .",
    "these lower dimensional metallic surface or edge states are protected via a particular , _",
    "e.g. , _ time reversal ( tr ) or crystalline  @xcite symmetries .",
    "a large family of topological insulators , appearing in materials with large spin - orbit couplings are time - reversal invariant three dimensional insulators ( 3d - ti ) .",
    "it turns out that the surface states of these materials at low energies , could be readily described with an effective 2d massless dirac hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the surface of some compounds like @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in particular have simpler structures , and support a single dirac - cone at their @xmath2-points  @xcite . at higher energies , however",
    ", corrections like quadratic - in - momentum and anisotropic hexagonal - warping effects should be included in the effective hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the chiral nature of these dirac states have some peculiar implications on their transport properties  @xcite .",
    "the back - scattering of these surface electrons from impurities , and therefore the localization is forbidden as long as the impurity potential does not break the tr symmetry  @xcite .    on the other hand , the story is totally different if a ti is doped with magnetic impurities .",
    "magnetic impurities break the tr invariance and the back - scattering is not prohibited anymore .",
    "the amplitude of the back - scattering could be controlled by the orientation of the magnetic moment of the surface impurities and , by the magnitude of the mass gap induced by the net magnetization of system .",
    "consequently the surface conductivity would become anisotropic , and strongly depends on the magnitude and orientation of the magnetization .",
    "bulk conductivity , on the other hand , is not necessarily sensitive to these details of the magnetic impurities and therefore magneto - transport measurements are very likely to be able to distinguish between the bulk and surface contributions to the conductivity of 3d topological insulators .    in this paper",
    ", we study the surface charge conductivity of a 3d - ti doped with magnetic impurities using a semiclassical boltzmann approach .",
    "the spin - momentum locking of the surface electrons makes their scattering from magnetic impurities anisotropic and the standard relaxation time approximation ( rta ) is not applicable .",
    "many attempts have been devoted to the development of a generalized rta for anisotropic systems  @xcite . however , it is still felt the lack of a closed form for the relaxation times of topological insulators with anisotropic scatterings . in this paper , following the general recipe of ref .",
    "@xcite , we present a closed form for the relaxation times of surface electrons of magnetic topological insulators , obtain the surface charge conductivity of the system , and show that it is anisotropic and strongly depends both on the direction of the spins of magnetic impurities and on the magnitude of the bulk magnetization . in particular , we find that the surface conductivity has its minimum value when the surface impurities spins are aligned perpendicular to the surface of ti , and therefore the back - scattering probability is enhanced due to the magnetic torque exerted by impurities spins on the spin of surface electrons .",
    "we also observe an interesting effect when the spin of surface impurities is parallel to the surface . in this case",
    "the surface conductivities become independent of the magnitude of the surface energy gap .",
    "we have organized the rest of this paper as follows . in sec .",

    "the green arrows show the directions of exerted torque ( @xmath6 ) on the surface electrons . in panel ( b ) the spin of magnetic impurity is along the @xmath4 axis and the backscattering process is more probable , while in ( c ) the torque is zero and therefore the backscattering is forbidden . in this case",

    "the _ minimal _ effective hamiltonian describing the surface electrons of a three - dimensional topological insulator is given by ; @xmath7 where the @xmath4-direction is chosen normal to the surface of topological insulator , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two - component creation and annihilation operators of electrons with wave vector @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the fermi velocity of surface electrons , and @xmath12 is the vector of pauli matrices for itinerant electrons .",
    "the above hamiltonian is indeed the two - dimensional massless dirac hamiltonian , which arises from the spin - orbit coupling of surface electrons and causes the helical order of surface states . in writing the effective hamiltonian  ( [ h1 ] ) , the quadratic and _ anisotropic _ cubic terms in momentum have been omitted , which is well justified in the low carrier concentrations  @xcite .",

    "naturally , magnetic impurities got placed both on the surface , and in the bulk of ti .",
    "the exchange interaction of surface electrons with bulk magnetic impurities aligns the spin of impurities which produces a magnetization in the bulk of the system .",
    "this bulk magnetization decreases by increasing the temperature and falls to zero at a bulk critical temperature @xmath20 .",

    "a more recent and comprehensive study of magnetically doped @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 using first - principles green s function method predicts even higher transition temperatures for higher concentrations of the magnetic dopings  @xcite .",
    "the bulk magnetization generates a temperature dependent gap on the spectrum of surface states which is proportional to the bulk magnetization . in order to capture these effects qualitatively , we will separate the contribution of bulk and surface impurities in the exchange hamiltonian  ( [ h_ex ] ) , while applying the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) to the bulk impurity part of it , we will keep surface impurities as the source of scattering for surface electrons , which later will be treated within the boltzmann formalism .",
    "however , note that this separation is not necessary and both bulk and surface magnetic impurities can in principle induce a finite gap on the surface states  @xcite , but in the following we will treat bulk and surface impurities separately only for the sake of definiteness .",

    "( [ eq : v_scatt ] ) classically .",
    "now , the total hamiltonian of surface electrons in the presence of magnetic impurities can be written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath4-component of the bulk magnetization @xmath29 breaks the time reversal symmetry of the surface states and opens an energy gap at the dirac point .",

    "the in - plane component of the magnetization , on the other hand , simply shifts the position of the dirac point in the @xmath38-plane , _",
    "i.e. , _ is a pure gauge , and hence has no impact on the physical observables of the system .",
    "therefore wherever we talk about a non - zero bulk magnetization , we will simply consider its component perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the magnetization and thus the energy gap strongly depend on thermal fluctuations in the system and vary with temperature .",
    "the massive dirac electrons with variant mass causes the emergence of different exotic phenomena . in the following",
    "we study these effects on the transport properties of the system .      in order to investigate the behavior of surface electrons , which weakly interact with dilute surface magnetic impurities , we model the surface electrons with @xmath35 and study their scattering from surface impurities using the semiclassical boltzmann formalism .",

    "<S> we study the surface conductivity of a three dimensional topological insulator doped with magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - momentum locking of surface electrons makes their scattering from magnetic impurities anisotropic and the standard relaxation time approximation is not applicable . using the semiclassical boltzmann approach together with a generalized relaxation time scheme , we obtain closed forms for the relaxation times and analytic expressions for the surface conductivities of the system as functions of the bulk magnetization and the orientation of the aligned surface magnetic impurities . we show that the surface conductivity is anisotropic , and strongly depends both on the direction of the spins of magnetic impurities and on the magnitude of the bulk magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the surface conductivity has its minimum value when the spin of surface impurities are aligned perpendicular to the surface of ti , and therefore the backscattering probability is enhanced due to the magnetic torque exerted by impurities on the surface electrons . </S>"
