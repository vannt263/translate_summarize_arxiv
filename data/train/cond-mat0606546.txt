    "the transient process under an abrupt turn on of the electric current through a conducting sample is described by a simple exponential dependence if the applied voltage is fixed , i.e. the load resistance is small and the circuit effects are not essential .",
    "the characteristic temporal scale of this process is determined by the momentum relaxation time , which depends on the average energy of electrons and on the mechanisms of electron scattering.@xmath0 such kind of exponential relaxation of electric current in pure bulk ge has been demonstrated more than 30 years ago.@xmath1 to investigate the transient processes , one can use ultrafast photoexcitation of carriers instead of an abrupt switching of the applied voltage . since this excitation creates non - equilibrium electrons inside the conduction band , the temporal dependence of the current contains a slow component reflecting the energy relaxation of these electrons owing to quasielastic scattering by acoustic phonons .",
    "this slow energy relaxation , corresponding to the temporal scale which is much larger than the momentum relaxation time , takes place for the electrons in the passive region ( i.e. for the electrons whose energies @xmath2 are smaller than the optical phonon energy @xmath3 ) , because the interaction of these electrons with optical phonons can be neglected at small temperatures @xmath4 .",
    "the slow temporal dependence of the transient photocurrent in this case occurs for the same reason as the dependence of the photocurrent on the excitation energy under stationary photoexcitation.@xmath5    if the energies of excited electrons are close to @xmath3 , see the initial distribution b in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , the absolute negative conductivity ( anc ) should take place , because the non - equilibrium distribution @xmath6 of electrons in the passive region becomes inverted ( @xmath7 ) in a certain interval of energies near the upper boundary of this region .",
    "though such a possibility has been discussed a long time ago@xmath8 for the regime of stationary photoexcitation in bulk samples , the anc effect has not been detected so far in this regime .",
    "the absence of the anc under a stationary photoexcitation is described by accumulation of low - energy electrons with time ( owing to slowness of interband recombination ) so that the relative contribution of the inverted high - energy part of electron distribution to the conductivity becomes non - essential .",
    "in addition , the coulomb scattering of high - energy electrons by the low - energy ones leads to a rapid broadening of the initial narrow distribution of photoexcited electrons in the energy space , thereby decreasing the contribution of the inverted part of electron distribution . to date , the anc has been realized by means of electron heating by electric field in many - valley semiconductors@xmath9 owing to intervalley redistribution of electrons , or when acting by microwave radiation on two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons in a quantizing magnetic field.@xmath10 recently , see refs .",

    "10 , it has been shown that the transient anc , which exists during a time interval of the order of momentum relaxation time , can be achieved by ultrafast photoexcitation of electrons with energies close to @xmath3 .",
    "the theoretical description of this effect@xmath11 has been based on the kinetic theory taking into account temporal non - locality of the response on the scale of momentum relaxation time and involving a detailed consideration of inelastic scattering of high - energy electrons by acoustic phonons . in this paper , we study the influence of classical magnetic fields on the transient anc in 2d samples with the geometry of a long hall bar , see fig . 1 ( b ) .    the main feature of the transient magnetotransport under consideration is the appearance of temporal oscillations of the longitudinal conductivity and transverse electric field ( hall field ) , whose frequencies are of the order of the cyclotron frequency @xmath12 ( hall oscillations ) . weak oscillations of this kind should be always present in the transient response because of the retardation of charge accumulation on the sides of the hall bar .",
    "the existence of the transient anc leads to the instability which dramatically modifies the transient oscillations . in the initial moments of time ,",
    "when the longitudinal current flows in the direction opposite to the applied field , the hall field increases in the direction opposite to its equilibrium one , because the sign of the lorentz force is changed in the anc regime .",
    "for the same reason , this increase is exponential : the charge accumulation on the sides leads to further enhancement of this accumulation . in the subsequent moments of time , when the partial inversion of the electron distribution is no longer sufficient to provide the anc , the system starts decharging , and , since the system posesses a certain inertia , there appear large - amplitude oscillations of the hall field as well as of the longitudinal current ( this current is coupled to the hall field ) .",
