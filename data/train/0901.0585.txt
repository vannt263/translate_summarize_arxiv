    "we study a database of e - mail records for 3,188 e - mail accounts at a european university over an 83-day period  @xcite .",
    "each record comprises a sender identifier , a recipient identifier , the size of the e - mail , and a time stamp with a precision of one second .",
    "we preprocess the data set and identify a set of 394  accounts which provide enough data to quantify human activity and which are likely neither spammers nor listservs ( see _ si _  sec .",
    "s1 ) .    in order to gain some intuition about e - mail activity patterns ,",
    "let us consider a fictitious student , katie .",
    "katie arrives at the university 20 minutes before her thursday morning class . during this time , she decides to check her e - mail and sends three e - mails .",
    "katie checks her e - mail after lunch and sends a brief e - mail to a friend before her next class .",
    "later that evening , katie sends four more e - mails once she has finished her homework .",
    "katie does not check her e - mail again until the following day when she sends e - mails intermittently between attending classes , completing homework assignments , and meeting social engagements .",
    "katie spends the weekend without e - mail access and does nt send another e - mail until monday .",
    "katie s e - mail activity , which is similar to many e - mail users , is both _",
    "periodic _ and _ cascading_. that is , there are periodic changes in her activity rate , which account for her sleep and work patterns , and there are cascades of activity  active intervals  of varying length when katie primarily focuses on e - mail correspondence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cnhppp_schematic ] ) .    if our intuition about deliberate human activity is correct , then the periodic patterns of activity should manifest itself in the inter - event time statistics , particularly when compared with the predictions of the truncated power - law null model which does not account for temporal periodicities ( see _ si _  sec .",
    "specifically , we anticipate that e - mail users typically send e - mails during the same 8-hour periods of the day .",
    "we therefore expect the data to have significantly more inter - event times between @xmath16 hours  the time required to send e - mails on consecutive workdays  than the truncated power - law model predictions .",
    "we therefore expect that the null model _ underestimates _ the number of inter - event times between 16 and 32 hours .",
    "due to the normalization of the probability density , the truncated power - law model will over - estimate other inter - event times .",
    "these predictions are all confirmed by the data , suggesting that periodicity is a fundamental aspect of human activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pqm_residuals ] ) .",
    "we propose a model of e - mail usage that incorporates the hypothesized periodic and cascading features of human activity .",
    "we account for periodic activity with a primary process , which we model as a _ non - homogeneous _ poisson process .",
    "whereas a homogeneous poisson process has a constant rate @xmath3 , a non - homogeneous poisson process  has a rate @xmath17 that depends on time . in our model ,",
    "the rate @xmath17 depends on time in a periodic manner ; that is , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the period of the process .",
    "consistent with our observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : activity_patterns ] ) , we relate the rate of the non - homogeneous poisson process  to the daily and weekly distributions of active interval initiation , @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where the period @xmath19 is one week and the proportionality constant @xmath23 is the average number of active intervals per week . as the average number of active intervals per week , we are implicitly assuming that the fraction of time spent in active intervals is very small .",
    "we have verified that this is the case for all users under consideration . also , it is important to choose the time step @xmath24 in the binning of the empirical @xmath25 to be sufficiently small such that the probability of an event occurring at time @xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "we choose @xmath28 hours , which meets this criterion while still maintaining computational feasibility . ]",
    "we further assume that each event generated from the primary process initiates a secondary process , which we model as a homogeneous poisson process with rate @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to these `` cascades of activity '' as _ active intervals _ , during which @xmath30 additional events occur where @xmath30 is drawn from some distribution @xmath31 .",
    "once the @xmath30 events have occurred in the active interval , the activity of the individual is again governed by the primary process defined by eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : nhppp ] ] .",
    "our model thus mimics how individuals like katie use e - mail : katie sends e - mails sporadically throughout the day , but once she starts checking her e - mail , it is relatively easy to send additional e - mails in rapid succession .",
    "we refer to the resulting model as a cascading non - homogeneous poisson process .",
    "to compare our model with the empirical data , we first need to estimate the parameters of our model from the data .",
    "ideally , the data would specify which events belong to the same active intervals  the active interval configuration @xmath32so that we could estimate the distributions @xmath25 , @xmath33 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the data we analyze , however , does not specify the actual active interval configuration @xmath34 so it is not evident whether , for example , @xmath31 should be described by a normal or exponential distribution .    because we do not know _ a priori _ the functional form of the activity pattern in the cascading process , we can not use the formalism implemented by , for example , scott and co - workers @xcite . instead , we introduce a new method that enables us to nonparametrically infer the empirical distributions @xmath25 , @xmath33 , and @xmath31 from the data .    given a particular active interval configuration @xmath32 , we can easily calculate all of our model s parameters and compare it s predictions with the empirical data : @xmath23 is the average number of active intervals per week ; @xmath25 and @xmath33 are the probabilities of starting an active interval at a particular time of day and week respectively ; the active interval rate @xmath29 is the inverse of the average inter - event time in active intervals ; and the probability of @xmath30 additional events occurring during an active interval @xmath31 is estimated directly from the active interval configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : activity_patterns ] ) .",
    "we then manipulate the active interval configuration @xmath32 to find the active interval configuration @xmath35 that gives a best estimate of the observed inter - event time distribution ( see _ methods _ ) .",
    "this method allows us to infer the best - estimate distributions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and",
    "@xmath38 given the data and our proposed model without making any assumptions on their functional forms .",
    "we next compare the predictions of the cascading non - homogeneous poisson process  with the empirical cumulative distribution of inter - event times @xmath39 for all 394  users under consideration in the present study ( see _ si _  fig .",
    "s7 ) . since we are using the empirical data to estimate the parameters for our model  that is , the estimated parameters _",
    "depend _ on the data  we must use monte carlo hypothesis testing  @xcite to assess the significance of the agreement between the predictions of our model and the empirical data ( see _ si _  sec .",
    "the visual agreement of our model s predictions are confirmed by @xmath40-values clearly above our 5% rejection threshold ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cnhppp_predictions ] ) .",
    "in fact , the cascading non - homogeneous poisson process  can only be rejected at the 5% significance level for  one  user , indicating that our model can not be rejected as a model of human dynamics . by comparison",
    ", the truncated power - law null model is rejected at the 5% significance level for  344  users .",
    "indeed , the null model is always rejected for many more users than the cascading non - homogeneous poisson process  regardless of the rejection threshold selected and our model displays none of the systematic deviations from the data observed for the truncated power - law null model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pval_comparison ] )",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that circadian and weekly cycles , when coupled to cascading activity , can accurately describe the heavy - tails observed in email communication patterns .",
    "the question then is , would rational decision making together with circadian and weekly cycles be equally able to describe the statistical patterns observed for e - mail communication ? even if the answer to this question is affirmative , parsimony suggests that rational decision making is not a necessary component of human activity patterns , given our simpler explanation .",
    "in addition to providing a good description of e - mail communication patterns , we surmise that our model is readily applicable to many other conscious human activities . for instance",
    ", most people make telephone calls sporadically throughout the day .",
    "after a telephone call has been made , it is effortless to make another telephone call .",
    "similarly , individuals run errands throughout the month .",
    "once an individual runs one errand , it is easier to run another errand during the same trip than it is to run errands again the following day . both of these anecdotes are illustrative of the way humans tend to optimize their time and effort to accomplish the tasks in their daily routines , a process that is captured by the periodic and cascading mechanisms in our model .",
    "the particular periodic and cascading features that are incorporated into our model depend on the activity under consideration .",
    "for instance , sexual activity is influenced by menstrual cycles  @xcite and airline travel is influenced by seasonality  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our model can also be generalized to cases in which the parameters are not stationary .",
    "this may be important , for instance , in the case of darwin and einstein s letter correspondence in which the number of letters sent per year increases 100-fold over 40 years  @xcite .",
    "although our model is only designed to account for a single activity ( e - mail correspondence ) , it can easily be extended to incorporate the multitude of activities in which any individual participates . to facilitate the inclusion of additional activities , it is useful to interpret our model as a non - stationary hidden markov point process  @xcite . within this framework , an individual switches between any two activities @xmath41 and @xmath42 with some probability defined by a non - stationary markov transition matrix @xmath43 which depends on time @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , our model can be redefined as a non - stationary hidden markov point process which switches between two states : a state in which an individual is not composing e - mails and a state in which an individual is composing e - mails .",
    "predictions of models that incorporate more than one activity can then be verified against data that records several activities for a single individual .",
    "our model further suggests a novel experiment  @xcite which not only records when an individual has sent an e - mail , but also when that individual is using a computer or actively utilizing an e - mail client . this additional data would provide direct empirical evidence for describing active intervals . in the absence of such data ,",
    "we have developed a simulated annealing procedure which allows us to nonparametrically infer the hidden markov structure of our model , providing insight into how to compare our model with other cascading point processes  @xcite .",
    "while our model provides an accurate description of _ when _ an e - mail is sent , a question left unaddressed is to determine _ whom _ the probable recipient of that e - mail is going to be .",
    "for instance , one might speculate that e - mails are sent randomly with some poissonian rate to acquaintances or individuals which share common interests .",
    "alternatively , it is plausible that e - mails are sent based on a perceived priority of important tasks , perhaps in response to previous correspondence  @xcite .",
    "when combined with our model that statistically describes when individuals send e - mails , quantifying the likely recipient of an e - mail will provide an important step toward describing how the structure of e - mail and social networks evolve .",
    "our study also provides a clear demonstration of how hypothesis testing  @xcite can objectively assess the validity of a proposed model ",
    "a procedure we vehemently advocate . using this methodology , we demonstrate that while both models reproduce the asymptotic scaling of the observed inter - event time distribution , our model is consistent with the entire inter - event time distribution whereas the truncated power - law null model is not .",
    "the consequences of our findings are clear ; demonstrating that a model reproduces the asymptotic power - law scaling of a distribution does not necessarily provide evidence that the model is an accurate mechanistic description of the underlying process . indeed ,",
    "there is mounting evidence that some purported power - law distributions in complex systems may not be power - laws at all  @xcite .",
    "there may be a common explanation for these apparent power - laws : complex systems are inherently hierarchical but the distinct levels in the hierarchy are difficult to distinguish  @xcite . in the case of e - mail correspondence for example , the active intervals are not recorded in the data data , thereby concealing the various scales of e - mail activity .",
    "this demonstrates how the mixture of scales of activity can give rise to scale - free activity patterns .",
    "we suspect that similar mixture - of - scales explanations  @xcite may provide a basis for the reported universality of heavy - tailed distributions in complex systems .",
    "we quantify the agreement between a model @xmath44 with parameters @xmath45 and data set @xmath46 by measuring the area @xmath47 between the empirical cumulative distribution function @xmath48 and the model cumulative distribution function @xmath49 : @xmath50 we specify @xmath51 , which is roughly uniformly distributed , to improve the numerical efficiency of our simulated annealing procedure .",
    "the area test statistic is advantageous as it is easy to interpret and it retains more information about the distribution than many other test statistics  ( see _ si _  sec .",
    ".      if we know the actual active interval configuration @xmath34 , it would be straightforward to compute the parameters @xmath52 of the cascading non - homogeneous poisson process .",
    "the data , however , does not identify the actual active interval configuration @xmath34 , we must use heuristic methods  ( see _ si _  sec .",
    "s5 ) to determine the best - estimate active interval configuration @xmath35 , from which we can compute the best - estimate parameters @xmath53 .",
    "we use simulated annealing to minimize the area test statistic @xmath47 ( eq .  [ [ eqn : test_statistic ] ] ) for the inter - event time distribution .",
    "thus , identifying active intervals that are consistent with our expectations for our model reduces to finding the best - estimate active interval configuration @xmath35 which minimizes the area @xmath47 between the empirical data and the predictions of the cascading non - homogeneous poisson process .",
    "our simulated annealing procedure is as follows .",
    "starting from a random active interval configuration @xmath32 in which adjacent events are randomly assigned to the same active interval , we compute the parameters @xmath45 of the cascading non - homogeneous poisson process , then we numerically estimate the cumulative distribution @xmath49 , and finally we measure the area test statistic @xmath54 of the active interval configuration @xmath32 .",
    "the active interval configuration is modified to a new configuration @xmath55 by either merging two adjacent active intervals or by splitting an active interval .",
    "if the new configuration @xmath55 reduces the area test statistic , then the new configuration is unconditionally accepted .",
    "otherwise the configuration is conditionally accepted with probability @xmath56 , where @xmath6 is the effective `` temperature '' measured in units of the area test statistic @xmath47 . after attempting @xmath57 configurations at each temperature",
    "so that each pair of @xmath58 consecutive events might be merged and split , we reduce the temperature @xmath6 by 5% until the active interval configuration settles at the best - estimate @xmath35 without moving for 5 consecutive cooling stages .",
    "we have verified that our simulated annealing procedure accurately identifies active intervals and estimates parameters @xmath45 in synthetically generated cascading non - homogeneous poisson process  data sets  ( see _ si _  sec .",
