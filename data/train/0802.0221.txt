    "short - lived luminous sources can produce echoes of their outburst in the ism .",
    "these echoes can be manifested as line emission from the gas , or reflected and thermally - reradiated light from the dust in the ism .",
    "they can be used to probe the morphology of the interstellar medium ( ism ) through which they are expanding and to reconstruct the historical record of the temporal behavior of the light source .",
    "visible light echoes have been detected around nova persei 1901 @xcite , v838 mon @xcite , and sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "fluorescent echoes arising from the equatorial ring around sn1987a have been used to probe the early hours of the burst from the sn , the radius of the ring , and the distance to the lmc @xcite .",
    "the supermacho project has discovered three additional sets of light echoes in the lmc which can be traced back to known supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and were used to derive ages of 610 and 410 yr for two of the snrs @xcite .",
    "one of the most unexpected discoveries made by _ spitzer _",
    "satellite has been the serendipitous detection of infrared ( ir ) light echoes in the vicinity of the cas  a snr .",
    "the possibility of detecting ir light echoes from ancient sne in general , and cas  a in particular , has been considered by @xcite more than 4 decades ago .",
    "cas  a is the remnant of a supernova that exploded @xmath10 yr ago in the perseus arm of the galaxy , 3.5 kpc away .",
    "the echoes were first ( and best ) detected in 24  @xmath11 m mips scans of cas a ( fig .",
    "[ casa_echoes ] ) .",
    "subsequent observations revealed that the echoes are also visible in all irac channels and ground ",
    "based @xmath12 band observations .",
    "the echoes vary on time scales of @xmath13 months , and extend at least @xmath14 from the snr @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have used the 24  @xmath11 m  maps of the echoes over a three year interval to probe the structure of the ism around cas  a , revealing its complex filamentary structure .    in this paper",
    "we combine early spectral observations with more recent data , that have revealed a wider extent of the echoes , to provide a detailed analysis of the nature of the radiative burst that gave rise to the echoes , and the density of the interstellar clouds giving rise to the echoes .",
    "we first present a brief review of the discovery of the echoes around cas a , and derive the ir spectrum of select echoing clouds spanning a wide range of angular distances from the snr (  2 ) .",
    "we also provide a brief mathematical review of the geometry of an echo , and derive the distances of the echoing clouds from the center of the explosion . in ",
    "3 we present the model input parameters : the burst delay time and its spectral characteristics , and the interstellar dust model used in the calculations .",
    "a stochastic heating model is used to calculate the thermal emission from the dust exposed to the burst of radiation , and in  4 we describe the dependence of the calculated ir fluxes on the burst characteristics .",
    "the model fits are then used to derive the properties of the burst and the echoing clouds (  5 ) . the results of our paper are briefly summarized in  6 .",
    "the initial mips 24 @xmath11 m observations ( a @xmath15 scan map ) of cas a serendipitously revealed `` chains of ir knots '' extending up to @xmath16 from the center of the snr ( hines et al 2004 ) . the team followed up with ground - based k band ( 2.2  @xmath11 m ) observations which revealed extremely high proper motions of the features .",
    "this motivated a second epoch of mips 24  @xmath11 m  observation that confirmed that much of the small scale structure outside of the cas a snr was changing on time scales of several months .",
    "a subset of the echoes seemed to represent a bipolar jet , nearly oriented in the plane of the sky , leading to the suggestion that at least these echoes may have been produced by a recent flaring of the cas  a neutron star around 1952@xmath172.5 a.d .",
    "@xcite , i.e. about 50  yr ago .",
    "subsequent mips 24  @xmath11 m  observations have been repeated at roughly 6 month intervals , and have been expanded to include at first a @xmath18 square degree field around the snr , and later a @xmath19 square degree field .",
    "examination of these data from the spitzer archive reveal that echoes are not restricted to the bipolar structure originally detected .",
    "they are found at all position angles with respect to the snr and extend at least @xmath20 from the snr ( limited by the size of the map ) .",
    "the neutron star burst scenario was dismissed in passing by @xcite . here",
    "we will provide additional physical evidence against such scenario .",
    "follow - up observations of the echoes also included low and high resolution irs observations of a bright echo in a filament located @xmath21 from the center of the snr .",
    "additional low resolution spectra were collected for outlying regions in the vicinity of the snr .",
    "two of the closest regions to the snr , located within the ne jet of ejecta and the sw counter jet , have emission lines and the 22  @xmath11 m  silicate feature that are characteristic of ejecta material @xcite .",
    "spectra of other regions exhibited a flat continuum and coincide with highly variable features , and are therefore assumed to be representative echo spectra .",
    "the discovery of the echoes with the _ spitzer _  led us to examine if the echoes could also be identified ( in hindsight ) in the map of the cas  a region that was obtained in 1983 with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) .",
    "figure [ casa_iris ] ( left panel ) shows a false color image at 12 , 25 , and 60  @xmath11 m  of the reprocesses _ iras _",
    "map of cas  a and its environment .",
    "the emission is dominated by cool interstellar dust grains , peaking at wavelengths of @xmath22  @xmath11 m  ( red regions in the image ) .",
    "however , there are several regions with excess 25  @xmath11 m  emission ( including cas  a itself ) from hot dust , which thus appear green .",
    "comparison to the 24  @xmath11 m  mips data ( right panel ) , smoothed to _ iras _  resolution , clearly shows that the 25  @xmath11 m  excess features are echoes which have moved between 1983 and 2003 . the fact that many echoes are in similar locations indicates that many of the clouds producing the echoes are structures that extend for at least 20  lyr along the line of sight ( cf .",
    "kim et al . 2008 ) .",
    "_ iras _  and _ spitzer _  have observed different portions of these large - scale structures",
    ".      for the purpose of this work we have concentrated on the analysis of six ir knots that were identified as echoes and have been the target of irs observations .",
    "the selected echoes , listed in table 1 and shown in figure [ casa_echoes ] , sample a range of angular distances from the nominal center of the explosion . also included in the table is a seventh 24  @xmath11 m  echo , without a spectrum , as a representative of the most distant echoing cloud .",
    "the sl+ll irs spectra of the echoes were collected from the spitzer archive .",
    "because there are often several sources or extended emission within the slits , we have reprocessed the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) using the ssc tools irs_cleanmask and spice .",
    "the off - target subslit positions were used to subtract background emission for the corresponding on - target position . in a few cases where the off - target subslit position crossed the snr ,",
    "a clean subslit position from an alternate target was used .",
    "both sl and ll data were processed , although in most cases the sl integration times were too short to detect the echoes , which are visible in all irac bands .",
    "therefore the analysis presented here relies only on the ll spectra .",
    "figure [ echo_data ] presents the @xmath23  @xmath11 m  spectra of the echoes listed in table  1 .",
    "all echoes within a 1000@xmath24 of cas  a exhibit a steep rise in their spectrum between @xmath25  @xmath11 m , not seen in the ir spectra of dust in the diffuse ism that is heated by the general interstellar radiation field @xcite .",
    "this spectral characteristic provides important clues on the nature of the emitting dust , strongly constraining the viability of different echo models .",
    "echo  6 is brighter than the echoes closer to the snr , and is part of a large extended structure that can be seen in the older iras data .",
    "this region appears to contain a non - variable emission component which would simply be the same cloud(s ) illuminated by the diffuse interstellar radiation field .",
    "we have therefore subtracted a scaled ism spectrum from the echo  6 spectrum such that its 20  35 @xmath11 m slope is within the range of the slopes of the other echo spectra .",
    "this non - variable component accounted for 20  50% of the 20  35 @xmath11 m emission .",
    "we assume that the echoes are the reradiated thermal emission from dust heated by the uv - visual output from the sn , located at point @xmath26 ( see figure [ ellipse ] ) .",
    "the emission from dust located at point @xmath27 will be detected by an observer at point @xmath28 with a delay time @xmath29 given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the distances of @xmath27 from the source and the observer , and @xmath33 is the distance of the observer to the source . the locus of all points with equal delay time is an ellipsoid with the source and the observer at the focal points .    using the law of cosines : @xmath34",
    ", we can express the distance @xmath31 in terms of the delay time @xmath29 and source distance @xmath35 as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the angular distance of the echoing dust from the source .",
    "figures [ dist_del_ang]a - c are three different depictions of the interrelations between the delay time , and the angular and physical separations of the echoing clouds from the source assuming a source at the distance of cas  a , corresponding to @xmath38  kpc @xcite . figure  [ dist_del_ang]a shows the echo distance from the source , @xmath31 , as a function of the delay time @xmath29 for the separation angles @xmath37 corresponding to the echoes listed in table 1 .",
    "all distances are bound by the lower limit @xmath39 which is the minimum distance corresponding to dust located at point @xmath40 immediately behind the source ( see figure [ ellipse ] ) .",
    "the vertical lines reprsents the maximum delay time , corresponding to @xmath41  yr , the age of cas  a , and a delay time of 50  yr .",
    "figure [ dist_del_ang]b depicts the echo distance from the source as a function of angular separation .",
    "the vertical dashed lines correspond to the angular separations of the echoes listed in table 1 .",
    "the filled squares and open diamonds correspond to distances calculated for delay times of @xmath42 and 50  yr , respectively .",
    "figure [ dist_del_ang]c depicts the physical location of the echoes with respect to the source , as projected on a plane that includes the source , located at the origin @xmath43 , and the observer ( off scale ) , located at @xmath44 .",
    "the vertical line going through the origin represents the plane of the sky going through the source .",
    "the two ellipses shown in the figure are the loci of all points with equal delay times .",
    "the filled squares and open diamonds represent the echoes listed in table 1 assuming delay times of 320 and 50  yrs , respectively .",
    "echo 7 with the largest separation angle from the source is almost on the plane of the sky when @xmath41  yr , but at a large distance in front of the source when @xmath45  yr .",
    "the figures illustrate that when delay times are short , a given range of angular distances will correspond to a wide range of echo - source distances , whereas long delay times will translate ino a significantly narrower range of echo - source distances for the same range of angular distances . when @xmath45  yr , the range of distances , @xmath31 , spanned by the echoes in table  1 is between 27 and 1172 lyr .",
    "this range is narrowed to only 160 and 359  lyr when @xmath41  yr ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the most obvious explanation for the echoes is that they were generated by the radiative energy released following the core collapse of the progenitor star of the cas  a sn , which occurred about 320  yr ago . since @xcite suggested that a subset of the echoes were produced by a recent flaring of the neutron star that happened around 1950 , we will also examine if such outburst could have produced the other echoes as well .    for each of the two scenarios ( @xmath29 = 50 or 320  yr ) we determine the incident flux required to produce each echo spectrum .",
    "since the two scenarios place the echoing dust clouds at different distances , these fluxes will translate into different burst luminosities . to check the viability of any physical scenario",
    "we require that all echoes are generated by a single burst with a well - defined intrinsic luminosity .",
    "it is possible to construct scenarios involving multiple bursts from a neutron star over the past 320 years .",
    "however , such scenarios have too many free parameters to be usefully constrained by the observations .",
    "furthermore , the construction of such scenarios seems unnecessary given the consistent results that are ultimately obtained with the 320  yr old sn echo scenario .      because neither the cas  a sn nor any subsequent outburst of the neutron star has been observed , we do not know the spectrum of the radiation that gave rise to the echoes .",
    "we will therefore explore three possible `` burst '' spectra : ( 1 ) an euv spectrum characterized by a temperature of @xmath46  k ; ( 2 ) a uv spectrum characterized by a temperature of @xmath47  k ; and ( 3 ) an optical spectrum characterized by a temperature of @xmath48  k.    the radiative burst giving rise to the ir echo could be generated by the breakout of the sn shock wave through the stellar surface , in which case the burst is powered by the kinetic energy of the explosion .",
    "a flash of euv - uv shock breakout radiation has been predicted by hydrodynamical simulations of sn explosions @xcite , however , because it lasts for only a few days , it has only recently been directly observed in a sn .",
    "its existence was first indirectly inferred in sn1987a from the detection of narrow uv and optical emission lines from the sn @xcite .",
    "the lines arise from an equatorial ring , located about 0.7 lyr from the sn and produced by mass loss from the progenitor star that was flash - ionized by the euv burst .",
    "more recently , @xcite , using the _ swift _ x - ray telescope , detected an x - ray burst from sn  2008d which they attributed to the shock breakout .",
    "alternatively , the ir echo could be powered by the energy released in the decay of radioactive elements that have formed in the sn explosion .",
    "in addition to the optical emission , a significant uv component has been observed in the light curves of all major types sne with the _ swift _ uv - optical telescope @xcite .",
    "the ir spectrum of the echo depends on the spectral shape and intensity of the flux incident on the dust .",
    "the luminosities of the burst are free parameters that will be derived from model fits to the ir echoes . the duration of the burst is constrained by energy considerations and only affects the thickness and overall brightness of the expanding light echo .",
    "the burst duration is a necessary parameter in converting the derived column density into a volume density of the radiating dust .",
    "we used the bare - gr - s model of @xcite to characterize the echoing interstellar dust .",
    "the model consists of a population of bare silicate and graphite grains and pah molecules ( see table 5 in their paper ) . in this model ,",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio is 0.0062 , and the abundance of its various dust constituents is consistent with solar abundances constraints .",
    "the size distribution of the different dust species are depicted in figure  19 of their paper , and the parameters of their functional forms are listed in their table  7 .",

    "@xmath60 collapses to the delta - function @xmath64 , and @xmath65      to model the ir emission from the echoing clouds we will expose a population of interstellar dust to a burst of radiation emanating from the sn .",
    "the burst spectrum will be characterized by a blackbody at a fixed temperature @xmath66 .",
    "a significant fraction of its soft x - rays and euv photons will be absorbed in the intervening medium to the clouds .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath67 , will be parametrized by the intervening ism column density , @xmath68 .",

    "numerically , @xmath70 is given by : @xmath74    since the h - column density to the echoing clouds is unknown , we will calculate the burst s attenuation for three different h - column densities given by @xmath75 , and @xmath76  @xmath5 . for a typical echo distance of 160  lyr",
    "these column densities correspond to average ism densities of @xmath77 and 1.0  @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "our burst model calculations were performed for seven different burst spectra characterized by different burst temperatures and intervening h - column densities .",
    "burst models are designated by their spectra : euv for @xmath78  k ; uv for @xmath79  k ; and opt  for @xmath48  k , and by a suffix of 18 , 19 , or 20 , corresponding to the assumed sn - echo column density . for example , model euv19  corresponds to a burst with a temperature of @xmath80  k and a column density of @xmath4  @xmath5 to the echoing clouds . model",
    "uv20  corresponds to a burst with a temperature of @xmath81  k and an ism column density of @xmath76  @xmath5 .",
    "we neglected any attenuation for the opt  burst .",
    "this model lacks any significant ionizing radiation , and therefore the extinction was negligible even for the largest column density .",
    "we calculated echo spectra for each burst spectrum for a grid of fluxes , characterized by different values of @xmath73 ranging from @xmath82 to 10 .",
    "for example , we calculated 16 ir spectra for burst model euv18 by varying @xmath73 from 0.001 to 1.0 with 14 intermediate values .",
    "the only free model parameter is the normalization factor , which is equal to the dust mass column density , @xmath52 , of the model spectrum that produced the lowest value of @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ burst_spec ] compares the fluxes from the different burst scenarios outlined above as they are incident on an echoing cloud at a distance of 160  lyr from the sn . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "the fluxes from the euv and uv bursts were calculated for values of @xmath84 , and the flux from the optical burst was calculated for @xmath85 , reflecting its expected lower luminosity . for sake of comparison , the figure also includes the flux of the general interstellar radiation field [ isrf ; @xcite ] .    figures [ olc ] , [ euv ] and [ uv ] depict the results for the opt , the euv and the uv bursts , respectively .",
    "the top panels in the figures show the calculated ir spectra of dust that is exposed to a range of illuminating fluxes , characterized by different values of @xmath73 . to illustrate the dependence of the spectral signature of the dust on the flux and spectral shape of the incident radiation we normalized all fluxes to unity at 20  @xmath11 m .",
    "the middle panels depict the best fits to the echo spectra by the incident fluxes .",
    "different echoes required exposure to different fluxes to fit their ir spectra .",
    "the bottom panels of the figures show the contributions of the different dust components to the total flux from echo  3 .",
    "the figures show that the radiation from the optical burst can not reproduce the observed characteristic rise in the echo spectra from 14 to 20  @xmath11 m .",
    "in contrast , both the euv and uv models reproduce the echo spectra fairly well , independent of the density of the intervening medium .",
    "the decomposition of the fits to echo  3 into the various dust components illustrates that the rapid rise in the echo spectra between @xmath25  @xmath11 m , is caused by the 18  @xmath11 m  silicate feature .",
    "two conditions have to be met to produce the observed rise in the echoes spectra : ( 1 ) the silicate grains have to be heated to temperatures in excess of @xmath0  k ; and ( 2 ) the silicate emission has to dominate the emission from graphite grains which have a smooth spectrum over the @xmath86  @xmath11 m  wavelength interval .",
    "the echoes generated by the optical burst fails to meet both conditions .",
    "silicate grains have a low opacity to optical photons and therefore remain at relatively low temperatures .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ tempfluc ] shows that the equilibrium silicate temperature is only about 83  k for the opt  burst .",
    "stochastic heating is limited to the smallest grains with sizes @xmath87   .",
    "in contrast , graphite grains have a much larger opacity at visible wavelengths and attain much higher equilibrium temperatures of @xmath88  k. consequently , the ir echo spectrum produced by the optical burst is dominated by graphite emission .",
    "the euv and uv bursts meet both requirements for producing the rise in the echo spectra .",
    "as shown in figure  [ tempfluc ] , they both possess sufficiently hard photons to raise the equilibrium silicate temperature to @xmath0  k. compared to the optical burst , a larger fraction of the small grains are fluctuating to temperatures beyond @xmath89  k. furthermore , the opacity of silicate grains rises dramatically in the euv , and becomes comparable to that of the graphite grains . consequently , as illustrated in the bottom row of figs .",
    "[ euv ] and [ uv ] , the total ir spectrum is dominated by silicate emission .",
    "it is of interest to examine to what extent our model fits to the @xmath901440  @xmath11 m  echo spectra also fits the average spectral energy distribution ( sed ) obtained by @xcite in the 2.2 , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 24  @xmath11 m  bands .",
    "this sed , shown in figure  [ krause ] , was obtained by averaging over 59 position in the northern lobe region of the preliminary mips image around the remnant .",
    "the bold line in the figure shows the model fit to the irs spectrum of echo 3 ( orange line ) .",
    "the x symbols represent this model s flux densities after integration over the irac and mips 24  @xmath11 m  bandpasses .",
    "these flux densities were normalized to fit the average echo flux density at 24  @xmath11 m .",
    "the fit to the average echo spectrum required the abundance of pahs to be increased by a factor of 2 over their general ism abundance .",
    "the increased pah abundance did not affect the fit to the spectrum of echo 3 since pahs contribute relatively little emission at wavelengths @xmath91  @xmath11 m .",
    "also shown in the figure is the average cirrus spectrum @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that if the echoes are only observed in the broad irac and mips 24  @xmath11 m  bands , their colors are very similar to those interstellar cirrus dust .",
    "consequently , the true temperature of the echoes is totally lost with this limited photometric data .",
    "in contrast , the _ iras _",
    "25-to-60  @xmath11 m  color ratio was clearly able to distinguish between the echoing clouds and the interstellar cirrus ( see fig .",
    "[ casa_iris ] ) , confirming the unique spectral signature of the echoes .",
    "the temperature of the echoing dust is much higher than that of the dust in cirrus clouds , requiring an incident flux that is significantly harder than the general isrf .",
    "the excess 2.2  @xmath11 m  emission is caused by reflection , and may therefore sample a totally different portion of the sn light curve , powered by the radioactivitis in the ejecta .",
    "the intensity of the reflected echo could therefore provide valuable information of the cas  a progenitor",
    ". the column density of the scattering dust could therefore be significantly higher than that of the thermally emitting dust , providing a geometry - dependent observational test of this hypothesis .",
    "the incident flux that provides the best fit to a given echo spectra can be converted to burst luminosity by : @xmath92 where @xmath31 is the _ actual _ distance of the particular echo from the sn , @xmath93  @xmath3 , and @xmath94  is the value of @xmath73 that produced the best fitting incident flux .",
    "each echo requires a particular incident flux to produce its ir spectrum .",
    "given this flux , the value of @xmath94  depends on the assumed column density of the intervening ism [ see eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) ] . a higher column density will require larger values of @xmath94 , corresponding to larger burst luminosities .    figures  [ lumbursteuv ] and [ lumburstuv ] depict the burst luminosities required to produce the echo spectra for the different burst models and delay time scenarios .",
    "we assume that all echoes were produced by a single burst .",
    "a viable echo scenario should therefore give the same burst luminosity for all echoes .",
    "the results show that a scenario with the 50  yr delay time produces a large spread in burst luminosities , compared to the 320  yr delay scenario .",
    "the figures shows that the dispersion in the derived burst luminosities for the latter scenario is only about 50% of the mean value ( see also table 3 ) , compared to a factor of two in the former .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the echo spectra are generally very similar , thus requiring exposure to the same incident flux of radiation . narrowing the range of burst luminosities for the 50  yr delay model will require more distant echoes to have systematically lower column density , a non - physical and contrived solution to this problem .",
    "we therefore support the conclusion of @xcite that the echoes were not generated by a hypothetical burst from the neutron star occurring about 50  yr ago . in principle , all echoes could have been produced by repeated bursts occurring over a period of 320  yrs .",
    "however , a more likely scenario is that the all echoes were produced by a single burst associated with the cas  a sn event .",
    "table 2 lists the model fits for each of the echoes assuming a 320  yr delay time . for each model",
    "we present the incident flux required to produce the best fit to the echo spectrum as characterized by the value of @xmath94 , the burst luminosity , @xmath95 , the column density of the echoing cloud , @xmath68 , and the @xmath83 of the fit .",
    "for each echo , the value of @xmath83 was normalized to unity for the best fitting model .",
    "from the values of the @xmath83  of the fit , we see that the opt  burst provides a significantly worse fit to the echo spectra than the euv and uv bursts .",
    "the euv and uv bursts are generally of similar quality , although for echoes 1 , 2 , and 3 , uv models are distinctly better .",
    "the models with a lower h - column density usually provided slightly better fits than the models with @xmath96  @xmath5 .",
    "the lack of any evidence for h - recombination lines from the gas around cas  a @xcite suggests that the burst ran out of ionizing photons before it reached the echoing clouds .",
    "inspection of figure  [ burst_spec ] shows that these conditions are easily met when the intervening h - column density is sufficiently high with @xmath97  @xmath5 .",
    "table 3 lists the burst luminosity averaged over all echoes for each burst model .",
    "it clearly shows the correlation between the derived burst luminosity and the column density of the intervening ism .",
    "larger column densities require higher burst luminosities to produce the same flux needed to produce the observed echo spectrum . excluding model results for the highest column density",
    ", we get that the average euv - uv burst luminosity is @xmath98@xmath3 .      in principle , the euv - uv luminosity could be either powered by the explosion energy or by the radioactive decay energy in the ejecta .",
    "a simple analysis , based on the best estimate of the properties of the cas  a progenitor @xcite , firmly rules out the latter possibility .",
    "based on explosion calculations , ejecta velocity and mass constraints , and @xmath99ti yields , @xcite estimate the mass of @xmath1ni to be between 0.06 and 0.2 @xmath100 . taking the average decay energy to be 1.73  mev and a decay lifetime of 8.8  d ,",
    "the maximum luminosity that can be powered by the decay of @xmath99ti is between 1.2 and @xmath101  @xmath3 .",
    "this luminosity is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that required to produce the ir echoes .",
    "the luminosities required to produce the echoes are easily obtained by tapping into the kinetic energy of the explosion .",
    "taking an average explosion energy of @xmath102  erg @xcite suggests that this energy must be released during a period of 40  d to produce an average luminosity of @xmath103  @xmath3 .",
    "several hydrodynamic models for the explosion of sn1987  a were constructed to fit the earliest uv and optical light curve @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite show that the burst had a peak blackbody temperature of @xmath104  k , cooling on a timescale of days to a blackbody temperature of @xmath105  k , the h - recombination temperature in the expanding photosphere .",
    "burst durations are therefore typically @xmath106  days . taking a burst decay time of one day ,",
    "suggests that only 2.5% of the kinetic energy of the explosion need to be thermalized to produce the required euv - uv luminosity .",
    "these simple arguments conclusively show that the echoes have revealed the breakout of the sn shock through the stellar surface . the combined constraints on the energy of the explosion , the required burst luminosity , and hardness of its spectrum can provide useful constraints for modeling the structure of the progenitor of cas  a @xcite .      from the fits of the calculated ir spectra to the observations we can derive the column density , @xmath52 of the emitting dust",
    "we take @xmath51 to be the width of the irs ll slit squared , @xmath107 .",
    "the corresponding h - column density is given by : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the dust - to - h mass ratio of the bare - sg - s @xcite interstellar dust model , and @xmath110 is the mass of the h - atom .",
    "the column densities derived for each echo and burst model are listed in table 2 .",
    "echo  6 is the brightest , and consequently has the highest h - column density .",
    "table 4 lists the column density of each echo , averaged over all euv and uv burst models .",
    "the average column density for echoes 1 - 5 is about @xmath111  @xmath5 , and higher by a factor of @xmath112 for echo  6 .",
    "all echoes within @xmath113 of cas  a are located behind the sn .",
    "the ir emission arises from a narrow region of thickness @xmath114@xmath115 , where @xmath115  is the burst duration . along the observer s line of sight that is illuminated by the burst of radiation .",
    "the width of the radiation front is determined by the burst duration @xmath115 .",
    "the hydrogen number density , @xmath116 , of the echoing cloud can be derived from the dust mass column density , @xmath52 , by : @xmath117 where the numerical value was derived for a nominal echo column density of @xmath118 .",
    "the burst duration should be taken as the length of time during which the burst spectrum is dominated by euv - uv emission . from the models of @xcite",
    ", we take this time to be about 1  d , giving an average cloud density of @xmath119  @xmath9 .",
    "this is a plausible density for the echoing clouds , corresponding to those of typical cirrus clouds @xcite .",
    "cas  a lies on the far side of the perseus arm [ e.g. @xcite ] , so there are relatively few ( if any ) denser molecular clouds behind the remnant @xcite to reflect the radiative burst from the sn .",
    "the _ spitzer _  satellite discovered a series of ir echoes around cas  a that are caused by the delayed arrival of thermal emission from dust heated by the radiative output from the sn .",
    "echo spectra are distinct from the ir emission from the diffuse ism , exhibiting a sharp rise at wavelengths from @xmath90 14 to 20  @xmath11 m . in hindsight",
    ", the echoes can also be found in the _ iras _  images from 1983 .",
    "we assume that the echoes are generated by thermal emission from interstellar dust heated by a single burst of radiation released after the sn event .",
    "we calculated the fluxes incident on the dust required to generate the observed echo spectra for different bursts characterized by blackbody spectra with temperatures of @xmath120 ( euv burst ) , @xmath121 ( uv burst ) , and 6000  k ( optical burst ) .",
    "our models show that the rise in the echo spectra is due to the 18  @xmath11 m  silicate feature .",
    "the silicate grains radiate mostly at the equilibrium temperature of @xmath122  k and dominate the echo spectra .",
    "the optical burst is incapable of heating the silicates to sufficiently high temperature required to reproduce the spectral characteristics of the echoes , and is therefore ruled out as the source of the echoes .",
    "the echoes are instead generated by the intense euv - uv burst of radiation generated by the shock breakout .",
    "we show that the echo spectra can be reproduced by bursts with a wide range of temperatures from @xmath123 to @xmath124  k. the burst luminosity required to generate the echoes depends on the assumed h - column density between the sn and the echoing cloud .",
    "we find the average burst luminosity to be @xmath125  @xmath3  for an average intervening h - column density of @xmath126  @xmath5 .",
    "the average h - column density of the echoing clouds is @xmath127  @xmath5 , which for a burst duration time of @xmath7  d gives an average cloud density of @xmath8  @xmath9 .",
    "this density is typical of dense cirrus clouds , and consistent with the location of cas  a behind the perseus arm and the paucity of dense molecular material behind the remnant    the luminosity required to produce the echoes can not be generated by the radioactive decay of the 0.06 - 0.2  @xmath100  of @xmath1ni that has formed in the explosion , and must therefore reflect the fraction of the kinetic energy of the explosion that was converted to euv - uv radiation as the sn shock broke out through the stellar surface .",
    "the cas  a echoes represent the first indirect @xmath24view@xmath24 of a shock breakout via the thermal dust emission from echoing clouds .",
