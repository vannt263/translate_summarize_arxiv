    "the study of x - ray properties of spiral galaxies was made possible by the einstein satellite ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations with spatial resolution resolved individual x - ray sources and revealed the existence of diffuse x - ray emission with @xmath4@xmath51 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is considered to originate from gas shock - heated by supernova ( sn ) explosions and stellar wind interactions and made by star formation activity .",
    "fe - k lines at @xmath66.7 kev were detected from starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. , iwasawa et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ) , indicating the existence of a hot plasma with a temperature of @xmath71 kev .",
    "the fe - k line was also detected from the central region of the normal spiral galaxy m31 @xcite , while the line has not been found in any other normal spiral galaxies so far .",
    "unresolved thermal x - ray emission with an intense fe - k line has been found in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "this is called galactic diffuse x - ray emission ( gdxe ) .",
    "the gdxe is found in the galactic disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the galactic center ( e.g. , koyama et al .",
    "1989 , 1996 , 2007b ; yamauchi et al .",
    "1990 ) , and the galactic bulge regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although information on the properties of the gdxe has increased since its discovery , its origin remains unsolved .",
    "the most important issue is whether the gdxe is truly diffuse emission or composition of numerous faint x - ray sources",
    ". if the diffuse origin is correct , the hot plasma having a huge thermal energy is hard to be confined by the galactic gravity . on the other hand ,",
    "if the point source model is correct , a large number of sources having a thin thermal emission ( @xmath4=510 kev ) with intense fe - k emission lines are required .",
    "the fe - k emission line may be a common feature among galaxies .",
    "thus , research for spiral galaxies is valuable for not only exploring the activities of the galaxies but also understanding the gdxe .",
    "m101 ( ngc 5457 ) is a nearby face - on sab(rs)cdi galaxy @xcite at the distance of 6.8 mpc @xcite .",

    "m101 is a vigorously star - forming galaxy .",
    "a color index , @xmath13 , is relatively small ( 0.45 , ned ) .",
    "uv band images , a sensitive probe for detection of young stellar clusters , show a clear spiral arm structure with bright regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the bright regions coincide with giant hii regions , sites of intense star formation qualified as starbursts .",
    "previous x - ray observations of m101 with einstein , rosat , xmm - newton , and chandra resolved many point sources and found diffuse x - ray emission with @xmath141 kev ( @xcite ; jenkins et al .",

    "the bulk of the diffuse soft x - ray emission is correlated with the uv emission @xcite .",
    "the spectral properties are similar to those of the giant hii regions @xcite .",
    "these facts imply that the diffuse soft x - ray emission is associated with star - formation activity : stellar winds from massive stars , sne , and superbubbles @xcite .    due to the lack of the sensitivity in the hard x - ray band ( einstein and rosat ) or the high detector background ( chandra and xmm - newton )",
    ", it would be difficult to find a hotter component .",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis ) onboard the suzaku satellite has better spectral resolution and lower / more stable intrinsic background than the previous x - ray satellites @xcite .",
    "especially , the xis has the best sensitivity in the iron line band .",
    "we analyzed suzaku archival data of m101 and found an emission line from the highly ionized iron , a sign of a hot plasma with a temperature of several kev .",
    "the results of a preliminary analysis were reported in @xcite . in this paper , we present the results of a further analysis and discuss the origin of the iron emission line . throughout this paper ,",
    "the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level .",

    "data reduction and analysis were made using the heasoft version 6.13 .",
    "the xis pulse - height data for each x - ray event were converted to pulse invariant ( pi ) channels using the xispi software and the calibration database version 2013 - 07 - 24 .",
    "we excluded the data obtained at the south atlantic anomaly , during the earth occultation , and at the low elevation angle from the earth rim of @xmath5 5@xmath18 ( night earth ) and @xmath19 ( day earth ) and also removed hot and flickering pixels . after the screening",

    "the typical positional uncertainty of suzaku is 19@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the systematic error of the peak determination is 8@xmath20 . taking the uncertainties into account , we identified these sources with xmm-1 ( xmmu j140303.9@xmath21542734 ) and xmm-3 ( xmmu j140414.1@xmath21542604 ) in jenkins et al .",

    "in addition to src2 , unresolved x - ray emission together with faint point sources is found in the central region of m101 .",
    "x - ray spectra were extracted from a circular region with a radius of 5 arcmin , 9.9 kpc at the distance of 6.8 mpc .",
    "the contribution of the bright x - ray source , src1 , was excluded , but those of src2 and the faint sources were included ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) was taken from the night earth data using xisnxbgen @xcite .",
    "after subtracting the nxb , we merged the xis 0 and xis 3 spectra , but treated the xis 1 spectrum separately because the response functions of the fis and bi are different .",

    "an equivalent width ( ew ) is estimated to be 1.0@xmath250.7 kev from the br@xmath21line model fit .",

    ", this value is an upper limit of the stellar source luminosity .",
    "the metal abundances and temperatures of abs and ysos observed in the mw are typically 0.3 times solar and 25 kev , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the spectra of cvs are represented by a multi - temperature plasma emission model ( cevmkl model in xspec ) with the maximum temperature of 20 kev and the metal abundance of at most @xmath60.5 solar ( e.g. , @xcite ) . assuming the above spectral model",
    ", we can estimate @xmath24 to be 34% of @xmath56 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath24=(0.71.4)@xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , which is lower than the observed value .",
    "thus , the well - known stellar sources can not account for the observed @xmath24 .",
    "the intense 6.7 kev iron line is found in young and middle - aged snrs . the plasma with a temperature of 25 kev and the solar abundance @xcite exhibits the intense 6.7 kev iron line with the ew of 12 kev .",
    "thus , hot plasmas produced by sn explosions are a possible candidate .",
    "active star formation in the past leads to multiple sn explosions , and then a large amount of diffuse hot plasma would be produced .",
    "radio observations have found many hi holes and shells , probably produced by sne or stellar winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of them , near to giant hii region ngc 5462 , is a large hole ( size@xmath61.5 kpc ) surrounded by expanding hi shell with a kinetic energy of a few 10@xmath62 erg @xcite .",
    "furthermore , snr mf83 and an x - ray source in ngc 5471b are suggested to be hypernova remnants @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate huge energy release in the past .    adopting the typical snr luminosity of @xmath6310@xmath64 erg s@xmath3 , ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", we can estimate @xmath24 of each snr to be @xmath67@xmath110@xmath651@xmath110@xmath66erg s@xmath3 , and hence the total number of snrs , @xmath67 , to account for the observed @xmath24 is 70010@xmath68 . taking into account that a typical snr age with a several kev temperature ( @xmath69 ) is @xmath7010@xmath71 yr , a sn rate is estimated to be @xmath67/@xmath69@xmath60.0710 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this scenario requires a higher sn rate than the current value ( 0.02 yr@xmath3 , matonick & fesen 1997 )",
    ".    a magnetic field may play an important role .",
    "if the magnetic reconnection as seen on the solar surface is occurred in the galaxy scale , a large amount of hot plasma would be produced @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field may confine the hot plasma @xcite . however , information on the magnetic field ( the strength , location , and configuration ) is too limited to discuss it in detail",
    ". measurements of the magnetic field are very important for further investigation .",
    "the thin thermal emission with the intense iron emission line is a similar feature to the gdxe . here",
    ", we compare our results with those of the gdxe .    a deep observation of the gdxe at ( @xmath8 , @xmath9)= ( , ) has resolved almost the gdxe flux into point sources @xcite and the origin of the gdxe",
    "is proposed to be due to a superposition of many faint point sources such as cvs and abs @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the gdxe spectra were successfully fitted by a sum of the spectra of magnetic cvs and abs .",
    "the best - fit model requires a larger fe abundance ( 0.60.9 solar ) than observed values from cvs ( e.g. , @xcite ) and abs ( e.g. , @xcite ) in the solar vicinity .",
    "this suggests that the well - known cvs and abs can not account for the iron line intensity of the gdxe , similar to the m101 results .",
    "cvs and abs with higher metal abundances or other x - ray sources having more intense iron emission lines are required .",
    "if the thin thermal emission mainly originates from the stellar sources , @xmath24 would be proportional to the galaxy mass .",

    "this may suggest that a substantial amount of iron line emission originates from high energy phenomena except for stellar sources .",
    "we found an intense 6.7 kev iron line from the face - on spiral galaxy m101 , this indicates the existence of a thin thermal plasma with a temperature of several kev .",
    "the iron line luminosity of the central region ( 5 arcmin radius ) is estimated to be ( 212)@xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , larger than that of the gdxe .",
