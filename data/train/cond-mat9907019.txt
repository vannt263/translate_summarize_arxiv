    "it has been established that the strong coulomb repulsion between electrons is the key issue in the physics of high - tc cuprates .",
    "anderson proposed that this strong correlation gives rise to resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state , where the spin and charge are carried by spinons and holons , respectively @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called spin - charge separation , and has been subject to intensive studies .",
    "one way of formulating the strong electron repulsion is to exclude the double occupancy of the electrons on each site , and study the effective hamiltonian within that restricted hilbert space .",
    "slave boson method is a useful tool to implement this constraint and fits the idea of spin - charge separation , where two species of particles , i.e. , spinons ( fermions @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and holons ( bosons @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , are introduced to represent electron operator @xmath9 , @xmath10 as @xcite @xmath11 here an electron is represented as the composite particle of spinon and holon . at the mean field level , these two species of particles are supposed to be independent of each other .",
    "the mean field phase diagram is determined by two phase transition lines , i.e , the spinon pairing transition and holon condensation characterized by the order parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "@xcite in strange metal state both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are zero , while only @xmath14 is nonzero in the underdoped `` spin gap state '' and only @xmath15 is nonzero in the overdoped `` fermi liquid state '' .",
    "the superconductivity is realized only when both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are nonzero , and the onset of the superconductivity is identified as the holon condensatoin in the underdoped region .",
    "however this simple - minded picture of spin - charge separation needs to be critically studied because the constraint is replaced by the average one in the mean field theory and the more appropriate treatment of this constraint might change the whole picture .",
    "this constraint can be taken care of by gauge field which corresponds to the fluctuation of the phase of rvb order parameter and lagrange multiplier to impose the constraint @xcite .",
    "therefore the effective model is that of the spinons and holons coupled to the gauge field .",
    "it should be noted here that the gauge field represent the constraint and does not have its own dynamics .",
    "the effective action and the inverse of the coupling constant @xmath16 for the gauge field is generated only after integrating over spinons and holons .",
    "therefore it is a highly nontrivial and crucial issue if the weak coupling perturbative analysis with respect to @xmath1 makes sense or not .",
    "this issue is closely related to the confinement / deconfinement of the gauge field.@xcite the original model is defined on a lattice and the gauge field is compact , and it is well - known that the gauge field is confining in the strong coupling limit , i.e. , large @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite a simplified and rough picture of the confinement follows . on the lattice",
    "one can define the gauge flux @xmath17 penetrating each plaquette @xmath18 , and the action is periodic with respect to @xmath17 with period @xmath19 .",
    "the simplest potential energy for @xmath17 is @xmath20 , and the kinetic energy of @xmath17 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electric field canonical conjugate to @xmath17 .",
    "a phase transition is possible between two states .",
    "one is the extended `` bloch wave state '' of @xmath17 where the tunneling events between different minima of the poriodic potential are driven by the large kinetic energy , i.e. , large @xmath1 .",
    "the conjugate field @xmath22 is localized on the other hand , and the string of the electric field is formed when positive and negative gauge charges are inserted with a separtion @xmath23 .",
    "this costs an energy proportional to @xmath23 because of the finite string tension of the electric field .",
    "this phenomenon is called confinement . for small @xmath1 , on the other hand ,",
    "the periodic potential is large and @xmath17 is confined within one minima .",
    "one can replace the poriodic potential by the quadratic one @xmath24 , which corresponds to the usual maxwell lagrangian .",
    "the coulomb law is reproduced in this case , and the periodicity is irrelevant .",
    "the gauge field is deconfining in this case . in ( 2 + 1)d these tunneling events",
    "are represented by the point singularities of the gauge field configuration called magnetic monopoles or instantons.@xcite in the pure gauge model , the interaction between the magnetic minopoles is @xmath25 , i.e. , the coulomb gas . because the coulomb gas in ( 2 + 1)d is in the screening phase , the gauge field is always confining due to these monoploes / instantons .",
    "when coupled to the holons and spinons , however , the gauge field becomes dissipative when these particles are integrated over , and the deconfining phase becomes possible in the strange metal normal state.@xcite however , in the presence of gapless fermion or boson excitations , the integration over them is in general not justifiable .",
    "the fermion part is better controlled because of the presence of a large energy scale , the fermi energy , and techniques such as large n can be used to control the expansion . the boson part is much more problematic because bosons tend to condense in the bottom of their band and we are faced with a strong coupling problem of bosons and gauge fields .",
    "it has been argued that the strong inelastic scattering due to gauge fluctuation suppresses the coherency and hence the ordering temperature , but the effects of the quantum fluctuation in the strong coupling limit is a difficult problem which remains unsolved . in this paper",
    "we hope that a duality mapping of a simplified version of the boson gauge field problem can shed some light on the issue . summarizing the above",
    ", there are two crucial and related issues in gauge models of high - tc superconductors , i.e. , the bose condensation and the confinement / deconfinement of the gauge field .    in order to clarify these two pictures",
    ", we study in this paper a simplified model , i.e. , a higgs model coupled to u(1 ) gauge field defined on a ( 2 + 1)d lattice , which is an important model of broad interests both in condensed matter physics and high energy physics.@xcite the action is given as @xmath26      - { 1 \\over g } \\sum_{\\rm plaquette } \\cos       [ \\delta_\\mu a_\\nu ( i ) - \\delta_\\nu a_{\\mu}(i ) ] \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the lattice point and @xmath28 specify the direction in the ( 2 + 1)d lattice .",

    "both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are compact and defined in the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "@xmath34 is the ( integer ) charge of the higgs bosons and @xmath35 ( fundamental ) for the holons while @xmath36 for the spinon pairing in the u(1 ) gauge model of high - tc cuprates @xcite .",
    "hereafter we take the unit @xmath37 except for eq.(27 ) in section iv .",
    "the amplitude of the bose field has been fixed , but the vortex excitations are allowed due to the lattice and the compactness . note that , in contrast to the high @xmath38 problem , the gauge field dynamics is maxwellian in the continuum limit .",
    "this model has been studied extensively , and the essential features are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) : :    in the limit @xmath39 , the gauge fields are    frozen out and we recover the xy - model . for @xmath40 ,    we expect a phase transition at @xmath41 . the ordered phase in @xmath42",
    "is    characterized by an order parameter    @xmath43 . for @xmath1 nonzero ,",
    "however , this object is not gauge invariant and can no longer serve as    an order parameter .",
    "@xcite instead we may fix the gauge to be , for    instance , the unitary gauge @xmath44 and consider    small gauge fluctuations . then we have the higgs mechanism where a    term @xmath45 appears in the action (    @xmath46 : the superfluidity density ) .",
    "the gauge flux    correlation has the form    @xmath47 ( 2 ) : :    the limit @xmath48 yields the compact qed model in    @xmath49 dimensions , which is known to be confining due to    the appearance of instantons.@xcite the instantons are singular    configurations of @xmath50 which act as magnetic    monopoles , i.e. , sources and sinks of magnetic fields .",
    "writing    @xmath51 as the sum of nonsingular and    singular configurations , we have    @xmath52    for a given instanton density @xmath53 , we have the analog    of poisson s equation ,    @xmath54 if the instantons form a gas , the density - density    correlation function is given by    @xmath55    in analogy with the more familiar density - density correlation function    of a coulomb gas , where @xmath56 plays the role of the    inverse screening length . combining eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq . ( 5 ) we find    @xmath57 when combined with the standard transverse correlation    from the nonsingular part @xmath58 , we have    @xmath59    equation ( 7 ) shows that the electromagnetic field acquires a mass due    to the gas of instantons.@xcite    thus we see that in both the @xmath39 limit and the @xmath48 limits , the gauge field is massive .",
    "this inspired fradkin and shenker@xcite to consider whether the two limits are smoothly connected to each other .",
    "their conclusion is as follows :    ( 1 ) : :    when the charge is fundamental ( @xmath60 ) , the strong    coupling expansion argument shows that the higgs phase with large    @xmath61 and small @xmath1 continues smoothly to    the confinement phase with large @xmath1 and small    @xmath61 .",
    "( 2 ) : :    when the charge is not fundamental , e.g. , @xmath62 , the higgs    and the confinement are different phases and can be distinguished by    the forces between the test charges @xmath63 .    in the bulk of this paper",
    "we will focus on the @xmath64 case .",
    "the phase diagram for ( 3 + 1)d and @xmath60 case has been determined at least qualitatively , and consists of two phases , i.e. , the higgs - confinement and coulomb phases as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the coulomb phase",
    ", the gauge field is deconfining and massless and the bose field remains disordered .",
    "however the phase diagram for ( 2 + 1)d and @xmath60 , which is the most relevant case to high - tc cuprates , remains controversial @xcite .",
    "one is that the xy - transition becomes first order once the coupling @xmath1 to the gauge field is turned on , due to the weinberg - coleman mechanism @xcite .",
    "this first order transition line terminates at some critical point .",
    "this resembles the vapor - liquid phase diagram .",
    "the other one is that a finite region of coulomb phase exists.@xcite    since instantons dominate the physics for @xmath48 , the key question is whether instantons play an important role for general @xmath61 and @xmath1 .",
    "vortex lines in the bose liquid carry unit flux quanua and these can originate and terminate at instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "einhorn and savit discussed the free energy of the finite vortex segments , and concluded that the xy - transition remains at least for weak @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite this leads to a picture of a finite region of the coulomb phase mentioned earlier .",
    "apart from the phase diagram , another issue is the behavior of the magnetic field correlation function in the region commonly labelled as confinement - higgs after the work of fradkin and shenker .",
    "@xcite the point is that even though the gauge field is massive , the correlation function in the higgs phase and the confinement phase are very different , being given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) and eq .  ( 7 ) , respectively .",
    "the question is then whether the correlation function is closer to eq .",
    "( 2 ) or eq .  ( 7 ) in the confinement - higgs region .",
    "as far as we know , this question has not been addressed . in this paper",
    "we include the effect of instantons for general @xmath61 and @xmath1 but we come to quite a different conclusion than einhorn and savit.@xcite the phase diagram we propose is shown in fig .",
    "the line @xmath65 is an isolated line with an isolated xy - transition .",
    "we also calculate the magnetic field correlation function and show that it takes the confinement form of eq .",
    "thus we conclude that the higgs - confinement phase is better described as the confinement phase .",
    "this is the main result of this paper which we discuss in section ii .",
    "it is known that the model given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes a bose gas on a lattice where the density is an integer .",
    "thus the confinement phase may be understood as a bose mott insulator . in section iii",
    "we extend the discussion to the incommensurate case , when the density is not an integer .",
    "we find two possibilities .",
    "the instantons may become irrelevant and the system becomes a superfluid ( higgs phase ) , or the system may break up into domains . in section",
    "iv we briefly address the case @xmath66 and also the case of two kinds of bosons with opposite gauge charges , which arises in the su(2 ) formulation of the @xmath67-@xmath68 model .",
    "we start with the continuum action for eq.(1 ) . @xmath69\\ ] ] here we have introduced the external electromangetic field @xmath70 , which is put to be zero for the moment .",
    "we allow the singular configurations of @xmath71 and @xmath50 corresponding to the vortex and instanton , respectively . as for the vortex",
    ", @xmath72 is devided into the single - valued part @xmath73 and the multi - valued vortex part @xmath74 as @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the vortex current . as for the instantons , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "is the instanton density as defined in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "we next derive a continuum version of the duality representation of this problem .",
    "the duality representation is a powerful tool which allows us to discuss the strong coupling limit ( large @xmath1 ) and is particularly useful for the present problem .",

    "it is noted that if we view @xmath88 as a gauge field coupled to the vortex current , the gauge symmetry is broken in eq.(11 ) , which corresponds to the non - conservation of the vortex current , i.e. , @xmath89 can be nonzero , due to the instantons . after integrating over the field @xmath88 in eq.(11 ) , the partition function @xmath90 is given by the integral over the vortex configurations @xmath91 including both the vortex loop and open vortex segments the two ends of which are instanton and anti - instanton @xcite .",
    "@xmath92\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the propagator of the field @xmath88 with the mass @xmath94 .",
    "this propagator is given as @xmath95_j   d(j - k , m^2)\\ ] ] where @xmath96 satisfies @xmath97 the propagator decays exponentially as @xmath98 , and the interaction between the vortex segments are short range .",
    "let us start with a qualitative estimate of the free energy of the vortex loop / segment regarding the partition function as that of a classical statistical mechanics .",
    "we first repeat the argument of einhorn and savit .",
    "@xcite let @xmath99 be the length of the vortex loop / segement .",
    "then the free energy is the sum of the energy cost and the entropy as @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the action for a instanton , and @xmath102 is a number of order unity which depends on lattice and dimension .",
    "the main difference between closed loop and open segment is that the two instanton action is added and entropy is enhanced by the factor @xmath103 @xmath104 in the case of open segment @xcite .",
    "however the leading @xmath99-linear terms are the same for both of closed loop and open segment , and einhorn - savit concluded that the proliferation of the vortices , i.e. , the appearance of the infinite length loop / segment , occurs at @xmath105 .",
    "this is the xy - like phase transition viewed in the duality picture .",
    "however the above consideration neglects the possibility that the long vortex loop / segment are cut by the instantons into small pieces , as shown in fig .",
    "let us consider that the total length @xmath99 is cut into @xmath106 pieces of open segments .",
    "the free energy in this case is @xmath107 minimizing this with respect to @xmath106 , we obtain the length of the pieces as @xmath108 , which is finite as @xmath109 . then due to the finite density instantons , the infinite length loop or segment does not appear .",
    "instead the vacuum is full of finite size open segments and closed loops of vortex .",
    "the total length of these loops / segments are infinite as the sample size @xmath109 when @xmath110 , but they are all finite size . therefore we conclude that the phase diagram of ( 2 + 1)d abelian higgs model is given by fig .",
    "1(b ) , i.e. , all the interior constitutes a single phase .",
    "analogy of the phase diagram with the ising model is useful here . in the duality picture ,",
    "i.e. , regarding the vortex field as the order parameter , @xmath61 can be regarded as the temperature @xmath111 , and the instanton density @xmath112 is the magnetic field @xmath113 .",
    "then it is natural that the ordered state at @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 , is the isolated line while all the other phase diagram is connected to the high temperature symmetric phase .",
    "actually this analogy becomes more clear when one consider the path integral formulation of the the ising model under magnetic field @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the partition function is represented by the sum over the closed loop and the open segment ended at the magnetic field vertex @xmath113 .",
    "this is exactly similar to the present case where the vortex segment terminates at instantons except that the vortex loop / segment has a direction and instanton has the @xmath116 topological charge . now what is the nature of this single phase ?",
    "one crutial question is if the meissner effect for @xmath50 remains or not .",
    "it should be noted that the magnetic field @xmath86 is tied to the vortices . in the case of closed loop",
    ", however , the net magnetic field @xmath86 is zero .",
    "the open segment , on the other hand , is a magnetic dipole which has net @xmath86 .",
    "therefore once the instanton fugacity is nonzero and there are vortex open segments , the magnetic field @xmath86 can penetrate into the sample , i.e. , the meissner effect disappears and the gauge field @xmath86 becomes massless .",
    "this corresponds to the `` dielectrics '' of the magnetic charge and is illustrated in fig.3b .",
    "the instantons and anti - instantons appear to be bound into pairs .",
    "however this state is not stable because once the meissner effect is gone , the confinement between the instanton and anti - instanton also disappears , and the magnetic dipole is liberated into free magnetic charges .",
    "this is the `` metal '' of the magnetic charge , and again the magnetic field @xmath86 can not penetrate into the sample due to the screening .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "this massive gauge field @xmath86 corresponds to the confining phase of the pure gauge model discussed by polyakov @xcite .",
    "therefore the state in the interior of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1(b ) continues smoothly not to the higgs phase but to the pure gauge model , and should be called `` confinement '' .    in order to substantiate the above consideration",
    ", we now go to the second quantization formulation of the vortex system .",
    "let us first devide the gauge field @xmath88 into the transverse and longitudinal parts , i.e. , @xmath117 .",
    "then the action eq.(11 ) is written as @xmath118\\ ] ] where we have performed a partial integration and identified @xmath119 with the instanton density @xmath53 .",

    "the vortices may be created and annihilated at instantons located at @xmath121 and anti - instantons located at @xmath122 .",
    "alternatively , we can write the action in terms of the second quantized vortex field @xmath123 . the action is given by @xmath124 \\psi_v   + u ( \\psi_v^\\dagger \\psi_v)^2 \\biggr]\\ ] ] where @xmath125 , and @xmath126 represents the short range repulsion between the vortex segments .",
    "the gradient term comes from the extra cost of the action when the vortex line deviates from the straight line .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath175 can penetrate the normal region and partially penetrate the patches .",
    "this state can maximize the surface energy gain for a fixed patch area and the patches will form some ordered structure . in the original boson representation , the absence of long - range order in @xmath123 means that the bosons form a superfluid with meissner effect .",
    "the instantons become irrelevant in this sense , in contrast to the @xmath176 case .",
    "the effect of the instanton is to cause a periodic modulation of the boson density ( corresponding to the modulation of the magnetic field @xmath175 by the patches ) .",
    "this modulation is weak for @xmath61 large ( @xmath168 positive and large ) and grows with decreasing @xmath61 .",
    "an ordered array of patches lead to a kind of incommensurate order .",
    "for very small @xmath61 , @xmath144 and there is a strong tendency for the order parameter @xmath123 to form in the dual picture . in this case",
    "the interface energy may become positive and we can not rule out a laminar picture . in the original boson picture this corresponds to stripes of superfluids separated by mott insulators .",
    "the transition between the stripe phase depends on details of the parameters and we have not attempted to work it out quantitatively . however , since stripes occur only for positive interface energy in our model , the stripe size in expected to be macroscpic , by ananogy with the laminar phase of type i superconductors .",

    "the singluar vortex configuration of @xmath201 is allowed , which corresponds to the original boson .",

    "23 ) , i.e. , @xmath207 is fixed by the @xmath128-term , and the vortex of @xmath207-field is forbidden .",
    "there is no meissner effect for the gauge field @xmath50 , although it is massive as in the pure gauge model .",
    "this corresponds to the binding or confinement of the two species of bosons @xmath188 and @xmath189 because @xmath208 is the difference between the boson densities of @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "this means that the single bose condesation is suppressed .",
    "the boson pairing condensation , on the other hand , is not disturbed by the @xmath128-term .",
    "therefore when the field @xmath209 is disordered , we have the boson pair condensation and finite superfulidity density @xmath46 .",

    "the the system show the meissner effect only for the symmetric test field @xmath214 .",
    "therefore the system shows the meissner effect to the external electromagnetic field @xmath154 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the interplay between the confinement and the condensation of the order parameters . at integer - filling of the bosons with charge @xmath22 , there is only one phase in ( 2 + 1)d with the xy - transition isolated only on the line @xmath215 .",
    "the nature of this so - called higgs - confinement phase is the same as the confining phase of the pure gauge model , and no meissner effect for the gauge field occurs .",
    "this is because the instantons act as ordering field for the vortex condensation . for non - integer",
    "filling , bose condensation is recovered for weak coupling @xmath1 .",
    "however , the bose condensation and confinement compete with each other , and this competition leads to phase separation for strong coupling .    in this paper we have focused our attention to the problem of bosons coupled to gauge fluctuations .",
    "it is only a first step towards addressing the problem which arises out of the gauge theory formulation of the high t@xmath216 problem , which involves both fermions and bosons coupled to gauge fields .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to put the present work in the context of the high t@xmath216 problem and attempt to draw a few inferences .",
    "the effect of the fermion is two - fold .",
    "first , if the gauge field is confining , it allows the possibility of confining fermion - antifermion pairs to form spin excitations and confining fermion and boson to re - constitute the physical electron .",
    "the former is believed to happen in the half - filled case where the af ordering may be described as chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of dirac fermions.@xcite secondly , the presence of massless dirac particles changes the dynamics of the gauge field and , in general , it would not take the maxwellian form assumed in this paper .",
    "we can divide the doping region of the phase diagram into three regimes :    * _ doping into the af _ @xmath217 . here",
    "the starting point is a @xmath218-flux phase for the fermions with a dirac spectrum .",
    "the gauge propagator is proportional to @xmath219 instead of @xmath158 in the maxwell theory.@xcite the instantons have logarithmic interaction @xcite and undergo a kosterlitz - thouless transition in the @xmath220 dimension as a function of @xmath221 , the number of fermion flavors .",
    "it is believed that the physical case of @xmath222 lies on the disordered side of this transition , so that the instanton gas behaves as free gas ( as opposed to instanton anti - instanton bound pairs ) . since our consideration",
    "is based on assuming the existence of the free instanton gas , this would be the case where our consideration has the best chance of being applicable .",
    "nevertheless , we still have not included the possibility of bosons combining with fermions to form physical holes in an af background .",
    "this would correspond to the formation of small fermi liquid pockets in a reduced brillouin zone . leaving this possibility aside",
    ", we can conclude from the results of section iii that instantons suppress the formation of a wigner crystal of doped holes .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of phase separation into microscopic patches is interesting , in that it suggests incommensurate structures which appear experimentally in this part of the phase diagram .",
    "however , the superfluid state that appear in our picture does not appear to resemble @xmath223-wave pairing , as long as the fermions remain confined in the af state .",
    "it is also interesting that phase separation into larger scale laminar domain is a possibility . finally in the su(2 ) formulation ,",
    "the result of section iv suggests the possibility of bosons forming a pairing state , leading to a co - existence of superconductivity and af .    * _ underdoped region_. here the normal state is the pseudogap state which is described as @xmath223-wave pairing of fermions or a staggered flux phase.@xcite again initially the fermion spectrum is dirac and the gauge propagation is proportional to @xmath219 and it is not clear that the present paper is applicable .",
    "nevertheless , we can ask whether the low temperature phase is a confinement phase where instantons are free and play an important role .",
    "there are three possible scenarios for the onset of the low temperature superconducting phase .",
    "the first is a binding of fermions with bosons to form physical quasiparticles .",
    "since the fermions are already paired , a superconducting state appears .",
    "this possibility is clearly beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the second and third possibilities are the bose condensation of single bosons in the u(1 ) formulation , or the pairing of two kinds of bosons in the su(2 ) formulation.@xcite the latter problem is treated in section iv .",
    "what we learn from the present study is that instantons tend to suppress bose condensation when the coupling constant @xmath1 is larger .",
    "furthermore , instantons favor the binding of the two species of su(2 ) bosons to form pairs which then condense , leading to a @xmath223-wave superconductor ground state .",
    "* _ the overdoped region_. here the high temperature phase is the strange metal phase and it has been argued that it is a de - confining phase due to dissipation in the gauge field dynamics.@xcite the low temperature fermi liquid phase is best described as a confinement of fermions and bosons .",
