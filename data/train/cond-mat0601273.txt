    "<S> these models are typically associated with some physical quantities that are characterized by power - law asymptotic behavior , instead of the usual exponential laws . </S>",
    "<S> most of these models do not take into account the node - to - node euclidean distance , i.e. , the geographical distance . </S>",
    "<S> one of them which does take into account this aspect of the problem has been introduced recently @xcite and discussed . in this example , as well as in others </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , strong connection has been revealed with nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> we follow the lines of @xcite which we extend in the sense that we include now a local variable denominated _ fitness _ or _ quality factor _ , we call this variable @xmath9 . the model studied by @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is herein referred to as the _ single fitness model _ ( sfm ) , that is , @xmath11 , and we also study the _ uniformly distributed fitness model _ ( udfm ) , in which the local fitness is an independent random variable . </S>",

    "<S> the network grows sequentially by adding a node at each time . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the first node @xmath29 at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the second node ( @xmath30 ) is chosen randomly with respect to origin in such way its distance @xmath0 obeys the probability law @xmath1 with @xmath2 . in this paper , we have chosen @xmath31 for all cases studied . </S>",
    "<S> next the second node is linked to first one . </S>",
    "<S> then , the origin is moved into network barycenter formed by the two nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the previous procedure is used to include the third site , fourth site , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> we link the third node ( @xmath32 ) to one of the pre - existing nodes in the network . </S>",
    "<S> we establish its connection by considering the linking probability given by @xmath33 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the connectivity of @xmath8 node is stood for @xmath7 and @xmath9 is its fitness and @xmath10 is its distance to new node @xmath34 . at this early stage </S>",

    "<S> we define the fitness or quality model in following way : to each node @xmath38 is assigned a uniform random value @xmath39 $ ] when the node is born . that value is kept constant while the network grows . in traditional models </S>",
    "<S> old nodes are more attractive than new ones . in this model </S>",
    "<S> we give a chance for new sites , with high fitness , become competitive .    </S>",
    "<S> the network growth process is sequentially repeated up to size desired for network . to avoid node position overlap we consider the lowest distance between them to be unit . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote @xmath40 the total number of nodes one can write linking probability for @xmath8 network node to connect the new node @xmath41 as @xmath42    the dynamics that we have introduced by the above rule does privilege the connection between new nodes and those having many links ( high fitness nodes ) since they are not so far from each other . </S>",
    "<S> one similar rule was explored @xcite for the particular case of uniform distribution of sites within some limited region at the plane , with @xmath43 . the @xmath19 parameter control the influence range of the nodes ( or hubs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath19 zero corresponds to the bianconi fitness model @xcite where distance is not relevant . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we will emphasize the following aspects :    * the network degree distribution in the stationary - state @xmath13 relative to number of nodes having @xmath44 links in the @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> * the temporal dependence of average number of links @xmath46 and more precisely to know how asymptotically it increase with time @xmath47 , @xmath48 . * the dependence of average length , @xmath49 , with @xmath19 parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are obtained for networks with @xmath50 nodes and @xmath51 runs . in this network size </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution @xmath13 practically enter in the stationary regime . </S>",
    "<S> the figure [ fig1 ] show our numerical results for @xmath13 ( symbols ) and fits ( continuous lines ) for udfm and sfm models . </S>",
    "<S> one can observe in our results that @xmath19 has a strong influence on @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the present results are very well fitted by the function @xmath52 where q - exponential function is defined by @xmath53^{1/(1-q ) } \\;\\;\\;\\;(e_1^x = e^x ) \\,.\\ ] ]    the variable @xmath54 is the characteristic number of links @xcite . in the figure [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we represent the figure [ fig1 ] in a @xmath55 - linear plot . where @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> .         values relative to measures on node @xmath57 . ]        analizing the figure [ fig1 ] , we have found that the udfm has raised the number of links per node and it turns out that hubs are more connected . in the figure [ fig3 ] we present the @xmath58 evolution curve with @xmath19 for both models studied . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that udfm curve is always above the sfm case . </S>",
    "<S> they have the same asymptotic limit , i.e. , @xmath59 .    the results for the node average connectivity @xmath21 are indicated in the figure [ fig4 ] where we show its temporal evolution . </S>",
    "<S> our data for @xmath21 can be fitted by the function @xmath60    the collapse of the curves for @xmath61 indicates a upper limit ( natural cutoff ) for a node connectivity . as much we increase @xmath19 all hubs reduce its connectivity to a minimal value @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this result imagining that the linking probability decays strongly for increasing @xmath19 in such way that a node does not see other unless its first neighbours , and therefore they form long node chains . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is inherent to the network growing rule , i.e. , if we use other rule for example each new site links with more than one node , this limit result would be quite different .    in the figure [ fig5 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show the exponent @xmath24 for udfm and sfm models . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent decline down from @xmath63 for udfm and from @xmath64 for sfm to a stationary value @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure [ fig6 ] shows the average length @xmath66 dependency on @xmath19 for udfm and sfm models . </S>",
    "<S> the average path length , @xmath66 , of a network is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path between two nodes averaged over all pairs of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we see that , when @xmath19 varies , @xmath66 raises rapidly to a saturated value @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation in figure [ fig6 ] is explained by the @xmath21 convergence in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig4 ] for @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we will summarize our present paper . following the lines of the paper @xcite we have presented a model in which we add fitness . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of competition between the relevant variable for connectedness when we include fitness on the network . in udfm model the popular nodes ( many links ) </S>",
    "<S> do compete with younger nodes when the fitness is a important factor that permits them to get more links . </S>",
    "<S> when we raise @xmath19 we favor the linking between first neighbours in the network . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath19 is zero we recover the bianconi - barabsi model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the average connectivity @xmath21 and average path length @xmath66 are appreciably influenced by factor @xmath19 for udfm and sfm models . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that degree distribution @xmath13 is very well fitted by the funtion proposed that contain @xmath18-exponential function that emerges naturally from non - extensive statistics . </S>",
    "<S> and when we compare our results relative to sfm we have obtained that the number of links per node has raised for all values @xmath19 . when the @xmath19 is increased we find that links per hubs has reduced as sfm but it occours slower . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of fitness changes the universality class in the complex network . </S>",
    "<S> then if you want a more complete scenario for this kind of system , fitness should be included . </S>"
