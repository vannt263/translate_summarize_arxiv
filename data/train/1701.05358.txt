    "in the past four decade , modeling and forecasting the time - varying conditional variance or volatility of the financial time series has received vast attentions . in the financial time",
    "series the periods of large volatility followed by periods of low volatility .",
    "this characteristic led to the idea that volatility is predictable .",
    "the arch and garch model introduced respectively by engle @xcite and bollerslev @xcite are quite successful in modelling the dynamic volatility of the financial time series .",
    "it has been shown that the volatility of the financial time series tend to display long memory and theirs correlations stay positive for long lags and decay slowly to zero ( see green and fielits @xcite , ding et al.@xcite , kokoszka and taqqu @xcite and cont @xcite ) . in the other hand",
    "the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the garch model decays exponentially which implys short memory and can not capture the long memory in volatility .",
    "baillie et al.@xcite proposed the figarch model to overcome this shortcoming .",
    "figarch process exhibits the hyperbolic decaying of the acf",
    ". however the variance of the figarch model always dose not exist .",
    "davidson @xcite extended the figarch model and proposed the hygarch model .",
    "the conditional variance of the hygarch model is a convex combination of those of the garch model and the figarch model respectively with weights 1-w and w. hygarch process has the desired property of the finite variance as the garch process while at the same time its acf decays hyperbolically .",
    "it is successful in modeling long memory dynamic of the volatility ( davidson @xcite , tang and shich @xcite and niguez and rubia @xcite ) .",
    "conrad @xcite derived the conditions for the non - negativity in conditional variance of the hygarch model .",
    "li et al.@xcite proposed a simplified score test for exponential decay against hyperbolic decay in the hygarch process .",
    "kwan et al.@xcite proposed a threshold hygarch model to jointly capture the long memory and regime switching between phases of low volatility and phases of high volatility .",
    "li et al.@xcite proposed a new hyperbolic model where it has to mixture components with bernoulli coefficients .",
    "li et al.@xcite proposed a hyperbolic model that has a form nearly the figarch process while allowing the existence of finite variance . empirical evidences",
    "show that economic or political events may cause the structure of the volatility changes over time .",
    "this means that a stationary model for volatility may not be adequate .",
    "models which allow for state - dependent or regime - switching behavior have been most appropriate and popular in application to financial time series .",
    "smooth transition ( st ) models are of the regime - switching models .",
    "this class of models deal with the structural changes in volatility and assume the smoothly non - stationary process . for review of the st model refer to granger and tersvirta @xcite , tersvirta @xcite , gonzales - rivera @xcite and lubrano @xcite .",
    "the st models are an extension of the two - regime models because they allow intermediate regimes .",
    "the main advantages of st models are that , it is not require to determine the number of the regimes ( states ) a priori , where it is a challenging problem and may led to over or under - fitting the number of the regimes .",
    "the st model changes smoothly according to the transition variable rather than jump suddenly between discrete states as markow switching models .    to impose the smooth transition structure for the conditional variance of hygarch model we allow the weights of the convex combination to be time dependent and logistic function of past observations .",
    "we denote this model by st - hygarch .",
    "the continuity property of the logistic function which relies on the different transition variables can led to different degrees of the smoothness .",
    "the st - hygarch model allows to conduct the smooth transition between the influence of extreme regimes and long memory feature of the volatilities in parsimonious way .",
    "we follow the method of alemohammad and rezakhah @xcite to derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the second moment to be asymptotically bounded .",
    "we develop a score test also called lagrange multiplier test to check the presence of the smooth transition property in the model . by simulation the size and power of the proposed test are evaluated .",
    "the parameters of the model are estimated via maximum likelihood method .",
    "real data of the _",

    "the stability of the model is analyzed .",

    "the smooth transition property are discussed .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the simulation .",
    "real example is considered in section 7 .",
    "finally section 8 concludes the paper .",
    "the first order hygarch model is defined as : @xmath0 @xmath1\\}y_t^2\\label{1},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are an _",
    "random variables with mean 0 and variance 1 .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "b is the back - shift operator .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the memory and weight parameters respectively . the hyperbolic memory of the model originated from the structure @xmath8 where @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17y^2_{t}.\\label{3}\\ ] ] where ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) are the conditional variances of the garch(1,1 ) and figarch(1,d,1 ) respectively .",
    "@xmath18 which determine the impression of the garch and figarch conditional variances in the hygarch model is constant over time and this dose not conform with the time - varying structure of the volatilities specifically in financial time series . hence we improve the dynamic behavior of the hygarch model by introducing time - varying weights .      a time series @xmath19 follows a first order st - hygarch model , if @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22    @xmath23y_{t}^2   \\label{7}\\ ] ]    and @xmath24 where@xmath25 are iid standard normal variables .",

    "it commonly assumed positive .",
    "when @xmath30 the logistic function become a step function and the st - hygarch model falls in the class of the threshold model .",
    "@xmath31 is known as the transition variable .",
    "there are several possible choises for @xmath31 .",
    "for example if @xmath32 ( for a suitable @xmath33 ) then the differences in the dynamic of the conditional variance are modelled according to the size and sign of the past shock , or @xmath34 means that regime switching down according to the past volatility .",
    "@xmath31 can be a nonlinear function of the previous observations .",
    "it can also be an exogenous variable . in financial literature",
    "several choices for @xmath31 is proposed , for example an international market return , economic index or the past cumulated returns ( see dijk et al.@xcite , grelach and cheen @xcite and mcaleer et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the extreme regimes occur when @xmath35 as @xmath36 ( wherein the st - hygarch model tend to figarch model ) and @xmath37 as @xmath38 ( wherein st - hygarch model tend to garch model ) .",
    "st - hygarch model is a member of the regime switching models class that allows the time series to move between extreme regimes where transition is smooth and governed by @xmath31 .",
    "the regime that occurs at time @xmath39 determined by @xmath31 and the associated value of @xmath28 so st - hygarch model is capable to generate changes in the dynamic behavior of the volatilities .",
    "one of the main property for any new proposed model is the stability of the model .",
    "here stability refers to the behavior of the second moment of model . in this section",
    "we show that under some conditions the second moment of the st - hygarch model is asymptotically bounded .",
    "the second moment of the model calculated as : @xmath40 note that relation ( [ 7 ] ) can be rewritten as :    @xmath41    so using ( [ 10 ] ) we have @xmath42    since @xmath43 , hence an upper bounds for i , ii , iii , iv and v are obtained as : @xmath44 by replacing the obtained upper bounds ( [ 110 ] ) in ( [ 11 ] ) an upper bound for @xmath45 is acquired as : @xmath46 let @xmath47 denotes the spectral radius of a matrix , then we make the following theorem for the stability condition of the st - hygarch model .",
    "let time series @xmath19 follows the st - hygarch model defined in relations ( [ 4])([8 ] ) , then the process is asymptotically stable in variance and @xmath48 if @xmath49 .",
