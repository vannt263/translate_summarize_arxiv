    "in two or more variables , few families of minimal cubature rules are known in the literature , none on unbounded domains . the purpose of this note is to record a family of minimal cubature rules on an unbounded domain .",
    "the precision of a cubature rule is usually measured by the degrees of polynomials that can be evaluated exactly . for a nonnegative integer @xmath0 , we denote be @xmath1 the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a domain in @xmath3 and let @xmath4 be a non - negative weight function on @xmath2 .",
    "a cubature rule of precision @xmath5 with respect to @xmath4 is a finite sum that satisfies @xmath6 and there exists at least one function @xmath7 in @xmath8 such that the equation does not hold .",
    "a cubature rule in the form of is called _ minimal _ , if its number of nodes is the smallest among all cubature rules of the same precision for the same integral .",
    "it is well known that the number of nodes , @xmath9 , of satisfies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath10 a cubature rule of degree @xmath5 with @xmath11 is called gaussian .",
    "in contrast to the gaussian quadrature of one variable , gaussian cubature rules rarely exists and there are two family of examples known @xcite , both on bounded domains . it is known that they do not exist if @xmath4 is centrally symmetric , which means that @xmath12 and @xmath13 whenever @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , in the centrally symmetric case , the number of nodes of satisfies a better lower bound @xcite , @xmath15    a cubature rule whose number of nodes attains a known lower bound is necessarily minimal .",
    "it turns out that a family of weight functions @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 on @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] admits minimal cubature rules of degree @xmath19 on the square @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] , which was established in @xcite for @xmath20 ( see also @xcite ) and in @xcite for @xmath21 .",
    "there are not many other cases for which minimal cubature rules are known to exist for all @xmath22 and none in the literature that are known for unbounded domains .",
    "to establish the minimal cubature rules for @xmath23 , the starting point in @xcite is the gaussian cubature rules in @xcite and it amounts to a series of changing of variables from the product jacobi weight function on the square @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] to the weight function @xmath24 .",
    "the procedure works for general product weight function on the square .",
    "moreover , as we shall shown in this note , that the procedure also works for an unbounded domain , which leads to our main results in this note .",
    "the minimal cubature rules are known to be closely related to orthogonal polynomials , as their nodes are necessarily zeros of certain orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we will discuss this connection and construct an explicit orthogonal basis on our unbounded domain in section 3 .",

    "a polynomial @xmath26 is an orthogonal polynomial of degree @xmath22 with respect to @xmath4 if @xmath27 let @xmath28 be the space of orthogonal polynomials of degree exactly @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath29 .",
    "the gaussian cubature rules can be characterized in terms of the common zeros of elements in @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath30 be a basis of @xmath28 .",
    "then a gaussian cubature rule of degree @xmath5 for the integral against @xmath4 exists if and only if its nodes are the common zeros of @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we now describe a family of gaussian cubature rules on an unbounded domain .",
    "let @xmath33 be a nonnegative weight function defined on the unbounded domain @xmath34 and let @xmath35 denote its normalization constant defined by @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the orthogonal polynomial of degree @xmath22 with respect to @xmath38 and let @xmath39 be the zeros of @xmath37 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath40 are real and distinct points in @xmath41 . the gaussian quadrature rule for the integral against @xmath38",
    "is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the space of polynomials of degree @xmath5 in one variable and the weights @xmath44 are known to be all positive .",
    "a typical example of @xmath38 is the shifted laguerre weight function @xmath45 for which the orthogonal polynomial @xmath46 is the laguerre polynomial @xmath47 with argument @xmath48 .",
    "the unbounded domain on which our gaussian cubature rules live is given by @xmath49 which is bounded by a parabola and a line for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which is the shaded area depicted in figure 1 .    ]",
    "the function @xmath52 is evidently a symmetric function in @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    ", we define the weight @xmath56 where the variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 are related by @xmath59 the function @xmath52 is obviously symmetric in @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so that it can be written as a function of @xmath58 for @xmath57 in the domain @xmath60 the function @xmath61 is the image of @xmath62 under the changing of variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which has a jacobian @xmath65 and @xmath66 . when @xmath67 is the shifted laguerre weight , we denote @xmath68 by @xmath69 , which is given explicitly by @xmath70    the changing of variables immediately leads to the relation @xmath71 where the second equation follows from symmetry .",
    "now , recall that @xmath40 denote the zeros of @xmath37 .",
    "we define @xmath72    [ thm : gaussian ] for @xmath73 on @xmath2 , the gaussian cubature rule of degree @xmath5 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 means that the term for @xmath76 is divided by 2 .",
    "for @xmath77 on @xmath2 , the gaussian cubature rule of degree @xmath78 is @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "the proof follows almost verbatim from the proof of theorem 3.1 in @xcite .",
    "in fact , by , the cubature rule is equivalent to the cubature rule for @xmath81 on @xmath82 for polynomials @xmath83 with @xmath84 , which are symmetric polynomials in @xmath53 and @xmath54 . by the sobolev s theorem on invariant cubature rules @xcite , this cubature rule is equivalent to the product gaussian cubature rules for @xmath52 on @xmath82 , which is the product of .",
    "thus , the cubature rule follows from the product of gaussian cubature rules under .",
    "the existence of these cubature rules also follow from counting common zeros of the orthogonal polynomials with respect to @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , a mutually orthogonal basis with respect to @xmath86 on @xmath2 is given by @xmath87 and a mutually orthogonal basis with respect to @xmath77 is given by @xmath88 both families are defined under the mapping .",
    "this was established in @xcite for the domain @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] , but the proof can be easily extended to our @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that the elements of @xmath89 are common zeros of @xmath90 , @xmath32 , and the cardinality of this set is @xmath91 , which implies , by theorem 2.1 , that the gaussian cubature rules for @xmath92 exists .",
    "the proof for @xmath93 works similarly .",
    "we are looking for cubature rules of degree @xmath5 that satisfy the lower bound , which are necessarily minimal cubature rules .",
    "such cubature rules are characterized by common zeros of a subspace of @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the weight function defined on @xmath41 and let @xmath68 be the corresponding weight function in defined on @xmath2 in .",
    "we define a family of new weight functions by @xmath95 where the domain @xmath96 is centrally symmetric and defined by @xmath97 ^ 2 \\cup [ 1,\\infty)^2.\\ ] ] thus , the weight function @xmath98 is centrally symmetric on @xmath96 .        recall that if @xmath103 , then @xmath104 and the mapping is one - to - one . for @xmath105 ,",
    "let us write @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "then it is easy to verify that @xmath109 from which it follows readily that @xmath110 whenever @xmath103 .",
    "the jacobian of the change of variables @xmath111 and @xmath112 is @xmath113 , so that the mapping is a bijection . since @xmath114 and the area of @xmath96 is four times of @xmath101 , the formula follows from the change of variables , the integral and the fact that @xmath115 is central symmetric on @xmath96 .      for the weight function @xmath68 on the unbounded domain @xmath96 , minimal cubature rules of degree @xmath19 exist , as shown in the next theorem .",
    "to state the theorem , we need a notation . for @xmath120 ,",
    "let @xmath40 be the zeros of the orthogonal polynomial @xmath37 , which are in the support set @xmath41 of the weight function @xmath38 .",
    "we define @xmath121 by @xmath122 since @xmath123 , it is evident that @xmath124 are well defined .",
    "we then define @xmath125    [ thm : cubacw ] for @xmath126 on @xmath96 , we have the minimal cubature rule of degree @xmath19 with @xmath127 nodes , @xmath128 .",

    "we prove only the case of @xmath134 , the case of @xmath135 is similar .",
    "our starting point is the gaussian cubature rule in , which gives , by , @xmath136 by or by direct verification , @xmath137 which implies that @xmath138 consequently , the above cubature rule can be written as @xmath139 for all @xmath84 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "the polynomial @xmath140 is of degree @xmath19 .",
    "since the polynomials @xmath141 are symmetric polynomials and all symmetric polynomials in @xmath142 can be written in this way , we have established for symmetric polynomials . by the sobolev s theorem on invariant cubature rules ,",
    "this establishes for all polynomials in @xmath142 .",
    "the number of nodes of the cubature rule in is precisely @xmath143 which is the lower bounded of with @xmath22 replaced by @xmath144 .",
    "thus , attains the lower bound .",
    "similarly , attains the lower bound with @xmath22 replaced by @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that a basis of orthogonal polynomials with respect to @xmath145 can be given explicitly .",
    "we need to define three more weight functions associated with @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath146 under the change of variables @xmath147 and @xmath64 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the three weight functions in are evidently of the same type as @xmath68 .",
    "we denote by @xmath150 an orthonormal basis of @xmath151 under @xmath152 . for @xmath32 , we further denote by @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 the orthonormal polynomials of degree @xmath22 with respect to @xmath156 for @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , respectively .      under the mapping @xmath165 , it is easy to see that @xmath166 becomes @xmath167 , @xmath168 becomes @xmath169 , and @xmath170 becomes @xmath171 .",
    "hence , using lemma [ int - para - cube ] , the proof can be deduced from the orthogonality of @xmath172 and symmetry of the integrals against @xmath173 , similar to the proof of theorem 3.4 in @xcite .    combining with and",
