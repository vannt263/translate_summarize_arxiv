    "the radio continuum and hi emission data sets come from the very large array ( vla ) galactic plane survey ( vgps ) , described in detail by stil et al .",
    "the data sets are mainly based on observations from vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",

    "we selected pn events with patterns 0 through 4 and applied flag filter flag==0 . excluding time intervals contaminated by background flares results in a net exposure of 12.4 ksec .",
    "we then constructed exposure maps in the 0.3 - 0.7 , 0.7 - 1.5 , 1.5 - 3 , and 3 - 7 kev bands for flat - fielding .",
    "we applied the  filter wheel closed \" ( fwc ) data for instrumental background subtraction .",

    "we use the x - ray spectral fitting package ( xspec ) to fit the background spectrum and find that it can be characterized by a combined model consisting of a thermal plasma component ( apec in xspec ) and a power - law component , both subject to absorption ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "these two components , scaled accordingly to the sky area , are applied to account for the background contribution in the source spectrum . the remaining emission in the source spectrum , presumably intrinsic to the feature ,",

    "albert et al . ( 2006 ) studied the @xmath28co images from dame et al ( 2001 ) and suggested the giant molecular cloud associated with w41 is best defined by integrated the @xmath28co peak emission from 70 to 85 km / s .",

    "( 2006 ) and confirmed that the recently discovered tev source hess j1834 - 087 lies towards a gmc .",

    "@xmath8co is useful as optically thin tracer of the molecular cloud so we reanalyzed the @xmath8co images of w41 .",

    "likely interacting with a massive cloud , 1998 ) .",
    "generally , the maximum acceleration efficiency @xmath43 of 10% is accepted , so the gmc is dense enough to produce the observed tev intensity with a lower acceleration efficiency .",
    "the protons could diffuse only partway into the cloud , resulting in the observed offset of peak co and p - p to @xmath49@xmath50 decay tev @xmath7-rays .",
    "the physical peak of x - ray and tev should be coincident .",
    "the column density of the molecular cloud is enough to absorb x - rays and cause the offset to the right of the observed x - ray peak respect to the likely true peak of the emission .",

    "landi et al .  ( 2006 ) found a faint x - ray source within the extent of hess j1834 - 087 and thereby suggested a possible pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) association .",
    "this x - ray source , located at ( _ l _ , _ b _ ) = ( 23.2340,-0.2657 ) , is also detected by the present xmm - newton observation , but there is no evidence for the existence of a pwn . instead ,",
    "the prominent diffuse x - ray feature is most likely associated with the tev @xmath7-ray emission .",
    "yamazaki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied the x - ray and @xmath7-ray emission from evolved snrs with an age of around 10@xmath51 yr and that from a gmc interacting with the snr .",
    "they showed that tev @xmath7-ray emission can originate from the snr , or from the snr shock running into a gmc , or from the gmc illuminated by high energy protons from the snr shock .",
    "these different origins may be distinguished by the x - ray to @xmath7-ray spectra .",
    "a simple diagnostic is the ratio of the @xmath7-ray to the x - ray flux , @xmath52 . according to yamazaki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , for the three cases ( in the above mentioned order ) , the value of @xmath53 is of order @xmath54 , 10 and @xmath55 , respectively , for their fiducial snr parameters . for young snrs found to show gamma - ray emission , @xmath53 is typically below @xmath52 . for hess j1834 - 087 , the 1 - 10",
    "tev @xmath7-ray flux is @xmath56 , based on the magic observation ( albert et al .",
    "our 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux is @xmath57 giving @xmath58 , with uncertainty of a factor of two .",
    "hess j1834 - 087 is possibly arising from a shocked gmc .",
    "this is supported by the presence of the gmc as found from the @xmath8co detection .",
    "the velocities indicate that the gmc is just behind w41 .",
    "the absorption column density of a few 10@xmath39 @xmath14 estimated from the x - ray spectral fit ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) also implies that the nonthermal x - ray emission associated with hess j1834 - 087 arises from within the gmc and is behind w41 .",
    "according to yamazaki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the x - ray emission from a shocked gmc or a gmc illuminated by high energy protons is likely synchrotron emission from secondary electrons arising from hadronic processes .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum that we find is also consistent with such a scenario .",
    "pulsar j1833 - 0827 ( b=23.386@xmath50 , l=0.063@xmath50 ) lies at the north side and about 10@xmath1 away from edge of w41 .",

    "our results for distance ( 4 kpc ) and age ( @xmath510@xmath6 yrs ) of w41 are consistent with the pulsar j1833 - 0827 , and support the possible associations w41/psr j1833 - 0827 also .",
