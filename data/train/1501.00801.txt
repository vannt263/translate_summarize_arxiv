    "experimental evidences on heavy ion collisions highlight , in different aspects , processes evolving on different time scales . at",
    "the fermi energies semiclassical dynamical models can not describe the system during its overall time evolution . according to the displayed phenomenology , the collected data are usually described as produced by a fast pre - equilibrium stage described through dynamical models @xcite and later stage processes described by statistical decay models @xcite .",
    "the statistical contribution is usually separated from the dynamical one through cut / extrapolation procedures applied to angular correlation and/or to particle kinetic energy spectra ( see as an example @xcite ) . when clearly identified @xcite , the attempt to measure observables in principle closely linked to only one of the two regime is therefore highly desirable .",
    "in fact , this eventuality allows to decouple effects related to the two classes of mechanisms that are linked to rather different nuclear matter macroscopic properties . in the last decades great efforts",
    "have been performed to extract information on the nuclear iso - vectorial forces by studying charge / mass asymmetric systems @xcite .",
    "these attempts concerns both the dynamical stage and the statistical decay of the produced hot sources .",
    "in particular in this last stage the isospin and excitation energy dependence of the level density formula play a key role and it is currently under investigation @xcite .",
    "a phenomenon closely linked with iso - vectorial - forces is the well known process leading to the redistribution in phase - space of the charge / mass excess @xmath7 @xcite of the emitted particles and fragments ( z is the charge , n is the neutron number and a the mass number ) .",
    "this phenomenon commonly referred as charge / mass or isospin equilibration process is rather complex in the fermi energy domain , especially when finite size effects of the studied system have to be properly taken into account .",
    "the charge / mass distributions related to the final fragments and particles are affected by the pre - equilibrium stage , which includes particles and fragments production in the mid - rapidity region , prompt emission , transfer of mass and charge between the main fragments and finally particles / fragments emission from hot equilibrated sources through a multi - step statistical cascade . as an example , in refs @xcite the transfer of mass - charge between the main partners has been investigated through the study of the isospin transport ratio obtained starting from the isotopic distributions produced near the projectile rapidity for medium - heavy symmetric / quasy - symmetric systems .",
    "in this paper we report on results of investigations on this equilibration process for the system @xmath0 at 40 mev / nucleon starting from a different and/or complementary point of view .",
    "the measurement was performed with the chimera multi - detector @xcite at laboratori nazionali del sud di catania ( italy ) .",
    "the main goal of the experiment was to evaluate , for well reconstructed events , belonging to selected classes @xmath8 , the quantity : @xmath9    the brackets indicate the average value over the ensemble @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath10 are the charges , laboratory velocities , charged particle multiplicity respectively of the produced particles in the selected class of events , respectively .",
    "finally @xmath11 is the center of mass ( c.m . ) velocity .",
    "we note that in this expression the contribution of produced neutral particles is implicitly contained in @xmath11 .",
    "the interest on this quantity was triggered by two main reasons :    \\a ) as shown in refs @xcite this quantity is closely linked with charge / mass equilibration process because it represents the average time derivative of the total dipolar signal in the asymptotic stage ( expressed in unit of @xmath12 ) .",
    "in fact , as an example , for binary systems , in absence of dynamical neutron - proton collective motion we have : @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the reduced mass number of the system , @xmath15 are the isospin asymmetries of the two partners 1 and 2 and finally @xmath16 and @xmath17 the related velocities . in the above expression",
    "we have supposed negligible the correlation of fluctuations between charge / mass ratios of the partners and their relative velocity . on the other limit ,",
    "the same quantity is zero if evaluated for a system represented by an equilibrated source before or after the statistical decay . as shown from dynamical microscopic calculations in a collision process between two nuclei",
    "having different charge / mass asymmetries , @xmath18 changes during the time towards smaller values in the pre - equilibrium stage ( spontaneous approach to the equilibrium ) producing @xmath5-ray emission through the excitation of a more or less damped dipolar dynamical mode @xcite ;    \\b ) because of the symmetries of the statistical decay mode , @xmath19 is not affected by the statistical emission of all the produced sources in later stages , as it is shown in ref .",
    "this essentially happens because , due to the vectorial kinematical character of this quantity , for well reconstructed events statistical effects are self - averaged to zero .",
    "therefore @xmath19 is a rather well suited global variable to selectively evidence dynamical effects related to the isospin equilibration process .",
    "the experiment was carried out by using 40 mev / nucleon @xmath20 and @xmath21 beams , at the lns super - conducting cyclotron .",
    "the beam impinged on 400@xmath22 @xmath21 and about 1200@xmath22 @xmath20,@xmath23 targets .",
    "the chosen combinations were the following : @xmath24 as the main system to be investigated , the @xmath3 as the auxiliary system ( see the following ) and the charge / mass quasi - symmetric @xmath4 as reference system . charges , masses , energies and velocities of the produced particles and fragments were measured with the 4@xmath25 multi - detector chimera @xcite . in particular , the @xmath26 technique was employed for z identification of fragments punching through the silicon detectors and additionally for isotopic identification of fragments with atomic numbers @xmath27 10 .",
    "mass identification is performed with the time - of - flight ( tof ) technique by using the time signal from silicon detectors with respect to the time reference of the radio - frequency signal from the cyclotron .",
    "the tof technique is basically used for velocity measurements of heavy ions .",
    "this technique is also essential for the mass and charge indirect determination of slow tlf s ( target like fragments ) stopped in the silicon detectors .",
    "energetic light charged particles , stopped in the scintillator crystal , are identified by applying the `` fast - slow '' discrimination method @xcite .    in the following we report results collected for events with a multiplicity of detected charged particles greater than or equal to 2 .",
    "we have chosen rather restrictive selection criteria to identify the `` good '' reconstructed events .",
    "these conditions are suggested from calculations to obtain the `` invariance '' of the investigated quantity with respect the statistical decay mode ( see table i ) . for the main system",
    "we have selected events for which the total identified charge @xmath28 .",
    "checks are being made to see at what extent the previous condition can be slightly released always keeping the above mentioned `` invariance '' condition to an acceptable level .",
    "the total detected mass was chosen in the interval @xmath29 .",
    "the total measured momentum along the beam axis has been selected within 70@xmath30 of the theoretical value ( 422 amu @xmath31 cm / nsec ) .",
    "analogous conditions have been imposed for the others investigated systems , taking into account the differences in the total mass and c.m .",
    "the well reconstructed events have been classified according to the charge of the biggest detected fragment @xmath2 and according to the estimated total kinetic energy loss @xmath32 . where @xmath33 is the incident energy per nucleon and @xmath14 is reduced mass number of the impinging nuclei . in the above expression @xmath34,@xmath35 are the measured masses and velocities ; @xmath36 is the total measured mass and @xmath37 the related c.m .",
    "velocity associated to the detected charged particles .",
    "therefore , each event has been characterized also through these two last quantities , that in the tkel evaluation can globally compensate the uncertainties due to the non perfect mass identification and velocity measurement .",
    "for the main system @xmath24 and the auxiliary one @xmath3 , in fig.1 we show the charge of the detected fragments as function of their velocity @xmath38 along the beam direction . in both cases",
    "the bi - dimensional plots show the dominance of processes producing tlf s and plf s ( projectile like fragments ) .",
    "the thin black curves represent the threshold of the @xmath26 charge identification technique as function of the fragments velocity evaluated for the typical silicon detector thickness of the chimera apparatus ( about 300@xmath39 ) .    for each velocity value , fragments having a charge smaller than the value plotted through the curves can be directly assigned by means of the @xmath26 technique .",
    "fragments having an higher charge will be stopped in the silicon detector an then the charge identification is obtained in an indirect way through the mass determination obtained by means of tof and energy measurements and by using the charity prescription @xcite .",
    "( color online ) charges z of the detected fragments versus their velocities @xmath38 along the beam axis are shown for the main system ( panel a ) ) and the auxiliary one ( panel b ) . ]",
    "therefore the comparison between the tlf charge distribution obtained in the main system in the indirect way ( upper portion of the z-@xmath38 plot in fig.1(a ) ) and the one related to the plf for the auxiliary system , directly assigned , ( lower portion of z-@xmath38 plot in fig.1(b ) ) allows to evidence eventual systematic errors in the indirect charge assignment associated to the main system .",
    "the comparison has been performed for different windows of tkel .",
    "it results that for tkel lower than about 350 mev the obtained charge distributions are similar and no systematic error is evidenced .",
    "this result is shown in fig.2 in panels a ) and b ) for the main system and the auxiliar one . for larger value of tkel ,",
    "the two distributions are different .",
    "in fact in this case due to the opposite kinematical conditions and to the finite geometrical efficiency of the detector , different reaction mechanisms are selected on average and the comparison is difficult .     for tkel@xmath40350 mev , ( panel a ) : charge distribution of plf s punching through the si detectors ( direct estimate based on the @xmath26 method ) for the @xmath3 system at 40 mev / nucleon ( panel b ) : charge distribution of tlf s stopped in the @xmath41 detectors ( indirect estimate based on the tof method ) for the @xmath24 system at 40 mev / nucleon , title=\"fig : \" ] -10 pt    the present study",
    "is focused on the investigation of the behavior of the component of @xmath42 along the beam axis z , @xmath43 . as for the case of the tkel determination and especially to compensate the eventual systematic errors in the fragment velocity determination , instead of the theoretical value @xmath11 , we are necessarily induced to use in eq.(1 ) the value of @xmath44 evaluated , event by event , from the velocities along the beam axis of all the detected charged particles .",
    "the obtained quantity will be named in the following @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath45 therefore represents a partial dipolar signal related to the intrinsic motion of the subsystem formed by all the produced charged particle . the contribution related to the global relative motion of the undetected free neutrons",
    "is not included . in the next sections",

    "the increasing average values of @xmath46 for @xmath2 different from projectile atomic number ( less peripheral collision ) , represents a clear signature of the evolution through charge / mass equilibration values ( see next section ) .",
    "the limiting value corresponding to almost `` grazing '' collisions ( along the beam axis ) , is evidenced in fig.3 by dot - dashed vertical lines .",

    "b ) the spectrum with star symbols is obtained by imposing a value of tkel@xmath4070 mev typical for quasi - elastic processes .",
    "the large fluctuations of @xmath45 around the average value are due to physical reasons ( the particular `` history '' of the each event ) and to the measurement procedure reflecting the related uncertainties . in fig.4",
    "we show analogous plots for the reference isospin quasi - symmetric system @xmath4 at 40 mev / nucleon . in this case the limiting value for `` grazing '' collision , @xmath49 is about -2.6 cm / nsec and , how can be clearly seen , the experimental plots shows values close to zero and an enhancement near the @xmath49 value ( fig.4b ) .",
    "the check on this system as compared to the main one ensure us on the good level of confidence obtained in the determination of @xmath46 .",
    "to obtain information on the behavior of the iso - vectorial interaction starting from the present experimental data , we have performed comd - ii @xcite calculations in the interval of impact parameters @xmath51 fm ( the weight of each @xmath52 is chosen proportionally to @xmath52 itself ) .",
    "dynamical calculations have been followed up to about 500fm / c .",
    "after this primary stage , the produced hot main sources have on average an excitation energy lower than 2.5 mev / nucelon . for each generated event ,",

    "c ) ) we show the comparison of the calculations with the measured value of @xmath50 ( red points ) evaluated starting from the already shown correlation plot in fig.3 .",
    "the values are referred to different @xmath2 windows and tkel@xmath40350 mev .",
    "the vertical bars indicate the evaluated statistical errors which include also , conservatively , a non - systematic uncertainty on the measured fragment charge @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding theoretical values are plotted in the different panels with black symbols .",
    "the obtained values for @xmath56 are rather different from the experimental results , they are out of the range value plotted in fig.5 .",
    "for this case a maximum value about 7 cm / nsec is obtained for @xmath62 while the minimum value about -20 cm / nsec is obtained for @xmath63 .",
    "the comparison of the others calculations with the experimental data is quantified in the figure through the shown @xmath64 value . according to this parameter",
    ", the case with @xmath55 gives the best comparison even if it is only slightly better than the case @xmath58 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath50 ( related to only charged fragments and particles ) can be understood in a qualitative way according to the following considerations : as shown in the previous figure ( apart from the case @xmath57 ) for @xmath2 smaller than @xmath47 ( dominance of mass transfer from plf to tlf ) and for @xmath2 larger than @xmath47 ( on - set of fusion , incomplete fusion ) @xmath50 increases ( there are on average more charge / mass symmetric produced fragments ) .",
    "in fact , in this case it can be verified that @xmath65 therefore the c.m . of the free neutrons",
    "has to be necessarily larger than @xmath66 , that means , on average , more neutron emission from the plf side .",
    "the case of @xmath57 produce instead for @xmath67 a larger negative value @xmath50 . in this case",
    "@xmath68 and therefore the cloud of neutrons has a c.m .",
    "velocity smaller than @xmath66 . in this case",
    "we have on average more neutron emission from the mid - rapidity and tlf side . a closer look to the fragments put in evidence in this case a dominance of processes producing a plf fragment , only partially equilibrated in charge / mass and a almost complete disassembly of the tlf . up to now",
    "we have discussed the behavior of @xmath50 which shows a good sensitivity to the parameters of the effective interaction . to recover information on the global degree of isospin equilibration",
    "we can evaluate @xmath54 through calculations by using the same set of parameters which `` best fit '' the experimental value of @xmath50 . in fig.5 ( panel d ) ) , we compare the calculated values of @xmath54 for @xmath55 with comd - ii+gemini ( including the efficiency effect ) with the experimental values @xmath50 .",
    "the connection between the two quantities can be approximated by the following simple relation : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the c.m .",
    "velocity for the subsystem of the charged particles .",
    "therefore the second term in the above expression give us an estimation of the effect associated to the undetected free neutrons @xcite which clearly participate in to determining the global degree of isospin equilibration . before to conclude this section we add some observations about the `` invariance '' of the discussed quantities with respect statistical decay modes .",
    "as previously observed this was shown in a rather general way in ref.@xcite . in the present work we have also checked if this insensitivity is still maintained by operating with a realistic efficiency of the chimera apparatus . in particular , in the `` simulated '' analysis we can keep the memory of the selected primary events from the dynamical model ordered according to the different @xmath2 values and tkel .",
    "it is therefore possible to evaluate the same quantity from the dynamical model @xmath71 without taking into account the gemini secondary decay processes and comparing it to the value of @xmath54 obtained from the complete calculations including the efficiency effects .",
    "the calculations have been performed for different @xmath2 windows and for @xmath72 350 mev .",
    "table i , as an example , collects the obtained results for different @xmath2 bins by using the calculations for @xmath55 .",
    ".for different windows of @xmath2 and for tkel@xmath40 350 mev the values ( cm / nsec ) of @xmath54 and the corresponding values of @xmath71 are shown for the @xmath24 system for @xmath55 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    from the table we can appreciate the close correspondence between the results after the gemini @xcite de - excitation stage and the ones related to the dynamical primary events .",
    "in summary , dipolar degrees of freedom for the collision @xmath0 at 40 mev / nucleon have been investigated for the first time by means of 4@xmath25 multi - detector chimera .",
    "the study has been carried out through the measurement of the observable @xmath46 ( associated to all the emitted charged particles ) and through a related estimation of the @xmath73 values which are closely linked with the global isospin equilibration process along the beam direction . the discussed insensitivity to the statistical decay make this observable able to investigate in an exclusive manner the overall dynamics on this phenomenon .",
    "the study performed on the behavior of @xmath46 and @xmath73 as function of the size of the biggest fragments for tkel@xmath74 mev shows a noticeable sensitivity of this observable to the parameters of the microscopic effective interaction .",
    "first attempts to reproduce the experimental values of @xmath46 in essentially binary processes show an overall agrement with comd - ii calculations using a stiffness parameter for the iso - vectorial interaction @xmath75 .",
    "more experimental investigation should involve different systems and different reaction mechanisms .",
    "in particular , a next step forward in this kind of measurements would require a more detailed investigation including a reliable valuation and/or minimizations of possible systematic errors on the velocity of the produced charged particles .",
    "this would permit a reliable experimental estimation of @xmath73 allowing also for a corresponding experimental valuation of the global effect associated to the dynamically emitted neutrons .",
    "for this purpose long measurements involving targets and projectiles having the same charge / mass asymmetry ( vanishing values of @xmath73 independently from the reaction mechanism ) are necessary .",
    "a more detailed analysis could also allows to estimate the specific contribution to the equilibration process produced by the prompt and mid - rapidity emission as compared to the transfer of charge / mass between the main partners . the more challenging attempt to investigate on the other component along the x impact parameter direction could be of relevant interest .",
    "@xmath76 in fact is linked , in a global way , and in an independent way from statistical emission , with the differential flow of particles characterized by different charge / mass asymmetries values @xcite .",

    "<S> moreover , the same comparison allows    to estimate the non - negligible contribution to the global isospin    equilibration process given by the un - detected emitted neutrons . </S>"
