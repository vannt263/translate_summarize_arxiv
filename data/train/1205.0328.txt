    "cosmological observations on expansion history of the universe indicate that the universe is in a phase of accelerated expansion . this phenomenon may be interpreted as evidence either for existence of some exotic matter components or for modification of the gravitational theory . in the first route of interpretation one",
    "can take a mysterious cosmic fluid with sufficiently large and negative pressure , dubbed dark energy . in the second route",
    ", however , one attributes the accelerating expansion to a modification of general relativity .",
    "a particular class of models that has recently drawn a significant amount of attention is the so - called @xmath1 gravity models ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these models propose a modification of einstein - hilbert action so that the scalar curvature is replaced by some nonlinear function @xmath1 . over the past few years",
    ", these theories have provided a number of interesting results on cosmological scales . in particular , there exist viable @xmath1 models that can satisfy both background cosmological constraints and stability conditions @xcite . among these cosmologically viable models",
    "there are some ones which also satisfy solar system constraints under a chameleon mechanism @xcite .",
    "+ in this context , it is recently shown that introducing an explicit coupling between the ricci scalar and matter lagrangian may explain the flatness of the rotation curves of galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , one generalizes the @xmath1 gravity models as @xmath2l_m\\ } \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are arbitrary functions of the ricci scalar @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the lagrangian density corresponding to matter systems .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 characterizes the strength of the non - minimal coupling of @xmath4 with matter lagrangian . when @xmath8 , there is no such an anomalous gravitational coupling of matter systems . in this case",
    ", the choice @xmath9 with @xmath10 gives the standard einstein - hilbert action while a nonlinear @xmath3 function corresponds to the usual @xmath1 modified gravity .",
    "+ varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath11 yields the field equations , given by , @xmath12 @xmath13t^m_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{2}\\ ] ] where the prime represents the derivative with respect to the scalar curvature .",
    "the matter energy - momentum tensor is defined as @xmath14 due to the explicit coupling of matter systems with ricci scalar , the stress tensor @xmath15 is not divergence free .",
    "this can be seen by applying the bianchi identities @xmath16 to ( [ 2 ] ) , which leads to @xmath17 the coupling between matter systems and the higher derivative curvature terms describes transferring energy and momentum between matter and geometry beyond the usual one already existed in curved spaces .",
    "moreover , it can also lead to deviations from geodesic motion in the theory described by ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "recently , there have been some attempts to use such an anomalous coupling to address dark matter problem @xcite and the cosmological constant problem @xcite . here , particular emphasis is made upon those features of the model ( [ 1 ] ) that could yield accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in fact , there have been already some works on this issue @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , in these works the important role of the non - conservation equation ( [ 4 ] ) is missed and the effect of the @xmath5-matter coupling in producing non - linear extra terms in the gravitational field equations is studied which leads to accelerated expansion under certain conditions . in the present work , particular emphasis is placed on the role of ( [ 4 ] ) by solving this equation in section @xmath18 and taking into account the evolution of matter energy density . by choosing a power law form for the nonlinear function @xmath4",
    ", we will show that the non - conservation of matter energy density means energy transfer between matter and geometry with a constant rate .",
    "thus the energy transfer is constrained by the second law of thermodynamics so that the latter only allows injection of energy into the matter system . in section @xmath19",
    ", we study this issue in a cosmological setting .",
    "we will show that this one - way energy transfer constrains the allowed range of the parameters of the model to produce cosmic speed - up . in section @xmath20 , the conclusions are presented .",
    "as it is clear from ( [ 4 ] ) , details of the energy exchange between matter and geometry depends on the explicit form of the matter lagrangian density @xmath6 .",
    "here we consider a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor as a matter system @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "the four - velocity of the fluid is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "+ there are different choices for the perfect fluid lagrangian density which all of them leads to the same energy - momentum tensor and field equations in the context of general relativity @xcite @xcite . the two lagrangian densities that have been widely used in the literature are @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . for a perfect fluid that does not couple explicitly to the curvature ( i.e. , for @xmath27 ) , the two lagrangian densities @xmath28 and @xmath26 are perfectly equivalent , as discussed in @xcite @xcite . however , in the model presented here the expression of @xmath6 enters explicitly the field equations and all results strongly depend on the choice of @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , it is shown that there is a strong debate about equivalency of different expressions of the lagrangian density of a coupled perfect fluid ( @xmath29 ) @xcite . here",
    ", contrary to @xcite , we will take @xmath25 as the lagrangian density of the matter fluid .",
    "+ we project ( [ 4 ] ) onto the direction of the four - velocity which satisfies the conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath32 with @xmath33 being a constant equation of state parameter .",
    "then , contracting ( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath34 gives the conservation equation @xmath35 we use friedmann - robertson - walker metric given by the line element @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scale factor .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy of the universe implies that @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the hubble parameter and an overdot indicates differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath41 . the expression ( [ b2 ] ) is then reduced to @xmath42 it is evident that the fluid energy is not conserved due to the explicit fluid - curvature coupling .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ b4 ] ) acts as a source term describing the energy transfer per unit time and per unit volume .",
    "this is , however , a general statement and there are some situations that in spite of such a coupling the right hand side of ( [ b4 ] ) vanishes .",
    "these situations are as follows : + 1 .",
    "when one simply chooses @xmath26 .",
    "we will see below that in this case even though the energy is conserved and there is no matter creation ( or annihilation ) , the fluid particles do not follow the geodesics of the background metric .",
    "+ 2 . when @xmath43 or @xmath44 constant .",
    "for instance , during inflation in which the scale factor exponentially increases the ricci scalar remains constant .",
    "thus the @xmath5-matter coupling does not lead to matter creation ( or annihilation ) in the inflationary phase for any @xmath4 function and any choice of @xmath6 .",
    "+ 3 . for the choice @xmath25 and taking @xmath45",
    "we have again vanishing of the right hand side of ( [ b4 ] ) for any @xmath4 function .",
    "this equation of state belongs to a perfect fluid which describes a cosmological constant ( with equation of state parameter @xmath46 ) .",
    "this is important since there is a tendency in the literature to model a cosmological vacuum decay scenario by considering an interaction between vacuum and cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath5-matter coupling models can not provide such vacuum decay scenarios .",
    "+ we now project ( [ 4 ] ) onto the direction normal to the four - velocity by the use of the projection operator @xmath47 .",
    "this results in @xmath48 @xmath49 this is equivalent to @xmath50 with @xmath51h^{\\alpha\\nu } \\label{b7}\\ ] ] this is an additional force exerted on a fluid element implying a non - geodesic motion .",
    "notice that since @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 and the additional force is orthogonal to the four - velocity .",
    "this is consistent with the usual interpretation of the four - force , according to which only the component of the force orthogonal to the particles four - velocity can influence their trajectory .",
    "+ the additional force due to @xmath5-matter coupling should be attributed to the first term .",
    "the second term proportional to the pressure gradient does not exhibit a new effect and is the usual term that appears in equations of motion of a relativistic fluid . in our choice , @xmath25 , the first term on the right hand side of ( [ b7 ] ) vanishes implying that fluid elements follow geodesics of the background metric and there is no additional force . in this case , matter is still non - conserved and the equation ( [ b4 ] ) takes the form @xmath54 to make a closer look at this equation , we assume a power - law expansion for the scale factor @xmath55 and we adopt @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 being constant parameters . putting the latter into ( [ b8 ] ) , gives @xmath61 in the following , we consider two different cases : +      in this case ( [ b9 ] ) reduces to @xmath63 we have @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 by substituting these results into ( [ b10 ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "this is a simple differential equation with an immediate solution of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an integration constant . alternatively",
    ", this solution can be written as @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this states that when @xmath73 matter is created and energy is constantly injecting into the matter so that the latter will dilute more slowly compared to its standard evolution @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath75 the reverse is true , namely that matter is annihilated and direction of the energy transfer is outside of the matter system so that the rate of the dilution is faster than the standard one",
    ". it is important to note that in an expanding universe ( @xmath76 ) and for a matter system satisfying weak energy condition ( @xmath77 ) , the sign of @xmath78 or direction of the energy transfer is solely given by @xmath58 .",
    "it is shown @xcite that all models which investigate possible interactions in the dark sector , the second law of thermodynamics requires that the overall energy transfer should go from dark energy to dark matter .",
    "this means that so long as the curvature is amenable to a fluid description with a well defined temperature , it should suffer energy reduction during expansion of the universe if the second law of thermodynamics is to be fulfilled .",
    "one immediate implication of this argument is that the second law of thermodynamics is consistent with @xmath79 for @xmath77 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 .      in this case ( [ b9 ] ) takes the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "combining this with ( [ b11 ] ) gives @xmath85 since @xmath86 , when @xmath87 remains of order of unity , we have @xmath88 . thus @xmath89 which gives evolution of matter energy density as the standard one @xmath90 with @xmath91 being an integration constant",
    ". in this case matter",
    "is conserved and there is no creation or annihilation . + before closing this section , we would like to comment on the two above cases .",
    "in general , the @xmath5-matter coupling implies violation of equivalence principle so that one should keep @xmath7 sufficiently small to ensure that the model satisfies local gravity constraints .",
    "one should actually tune @xmath92 to reduce the effects of such violation below current experimental accuracy . in our case ,",
    "the choice @xmath25 make the extra force attributed to the @xmath5-matter coupling vanish and there will be no deviation from geodesics motion . in other terms , test particles with different compositions follow geodesics of the background metric . in this case",
    ", there is no constraint on @xmath93 coming from local experiments and the two cases @xmath62 and @xmath82 can be interpreted as two regimes in which the curvature @xmath94 is , respectively , large and small with respect to @xmath93 . for @xmath95 , since @xmath5 decreases in an expanding universe , the two regimes @xmath62 and @xmath82 correspond to early and late times for @xmath79 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the reverse is true .",
    "we will return to this issue later .",
    "we can recast the equations ( [ 2 ] ) in a way that the higher order corrections are written as an energy - momentum tensor of geometrical origin describing an effective source term on the right hand side of the standard einstein field equations , namely , @xmath96 where @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 for the metric ( [ b3 ] ) and in a spatially flat case @xmath100 , the field equations become @xmath101 @xmath102 \\label{c5}\\ ] ] where energy density and pressure corresponding to curvature are @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 + 4\\lambda \\omega f''_2 \\dot{r}\\dot{\\rho}_m+\\frac{1}{2}(f_1-rf'_1)+\\lambda \\omega f_2\\rho_m\\ } \\label{c7}\\ ] ] in which we have set @xmath107 . in order to get more realization about the effects of nonlinear terms arising from @xmath5-matter coupling ,",
    "we write the two expressions ( [ c6 ] ) and ( [ c7 ] ) in two different cases . in one case ,",
    "they are written for @xmath108 , @xmath109 @xmath110 in the other case , we consider them for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 @xmath114\\ ] ] @xmath115 like usual @xmath1 gravity models , the former set is written in terms of @xmath5 and its derivatives while the latter set has also terms containing energy density and pressure of matter due to the @xmath5-matter coupling . in both sets ,",
    "@xmath116 and @xmath117 can be interpreted as energy density and pressure of an effective fluid which provides new possibilities in a cosmological setting .",
    "a significant part of the motivation for @xmath1 gravity is that it can lead to accelerated expansion at late times without the need for dark energy and also at early times without recourse to an inflaton field .",
    "in fact , under certain conditions which should be met by the function @xmath3 in ( [ c6 - 1 ] ) and ( [ c7 - 1 ] ) , the curvature fluid can take a sufficiently negative pressure and produce a cosmic speed - up .",
    "similarly , the curvature fluid presented in non - minimal coupling models may have a relevant role in addressing some problems such as dark matter and dark energy .",
    "there is also a hope to achieve an explanation for the coincidence problem , due to the appearance of energy density and pressure of matter in ( [ c6 - 2 ] ) and ( [ c7 - 2 ] ) @xcite . + for solving ( [ c4 ] ) and ( [ c5 ] ) , we should first fix the function @xmath3 . in order to make our analysis less complicated and",
    "since we are only interested in the effects of @xmath5-matter coupling , we will take @xmath3 as linear and set @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , we should have the scaling of @xmath118 which is given by ( [ b13 ] ) and ( [ b18 ] ) for @xmath62 and @xmath82 , respectively . + for @xmath62 , the matter system is not conserved and @xmath22 is given by @xmath119 taking into account the expressions @xmath56 and @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath120^{1-n}t^{2n}t^{3\\gamma m}+2\\lambda \\alpha n \\omega \\rho_0 a_0^{-3\\gamma}t^2 } \\label{c8}\\ ] ] @xmath121^{1-n}t^{2n}t^{3\\gamma m}+2\\lambda \\alpha n \\omega \\rho_0 a_0^{-3\\gamma}t^2 } \\label{c9}\\ ] ] where @xmath122+(2m-1)\\ } \\label{c10}\\ ] ] @xmath123\\ } \\label{c11}\\ ] ] in the gravitational equations ( [ c4 ] ) and ( [ c5 ] ) , the left hand side decays as @xmath124 while time variations of the right hand side are given by ( [ cc8 ] ) , ( [ c8 ] ) and ( [ c9 ] ) .",
    "thus , in a curvature dominated regime in which @xmath125 , one can write @xmath126 or , equivalently , @xmath127 note that for a dust matter system ( @xmath128 ) , this solution gives @xmath129 implying that there is no accelerating expansion .",

    "+ accelerating expansion of the universe puts constraints on the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath58 . to see this ,",
    "let us first consider @xmath62 which corresponds to early ( late ) times for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) in expansion history of the universe . in this regime ,",
    "the matter system is not conserved and there is an energy transfer between matter and geometry .",
    "for @xmath136 , one can write @xmath137 as previously stated , the second law of thermodynamics requires that @xmath79 ( for @xmath77 ) which translates to @xmath138 , implying violation of strong energy condition . in einstein gravity",
    ", this is the same condition that a perfect fluid ( or dark energy ) should satisfy in order to produce accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath80 ( for @xmath81 ) . in this case ,",
    "( [ c18 - 1 ] ) requires @xmath139 which is not consistent with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "+ on the other hand , in the regime @xmath82 which corresponds to late ( early ) times for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) the matter is nearly conserved and there is no constraint coming from the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "for @xmath136 , the relation ( [ c18 ] ) gives @xmath140 implying that accelerating expansion is possible for both @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "+ our power law solutions give a constant equation of state parameter @xmath143 which can be written in terms of @xmath58 and @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding parameters space , which is constrained by the above conditions for accelerating expansion of the universe , can be subjected to additional constraints coming from recent observations on the equation of state of dark energy . to do this",
    ", we consider @xmath82 when @xmath142 since it is only in this case that the present model can lead to cosmic expansion in the presence of a matter system satisfying energy conditions .",
    "one can write @xmath144 which for a given @xmath33 and using ( [ c16 ] ) , ( [ c17 ] ) and ( [ c18 ] ) gives @xmath145 only in terms of @xmath58 . by combining the result with the constraint @xmath146 , coming from observations on sne ia @xcite",
    ", one can constrain the parameter @xmath58 . as an illustration ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath145 in terms of @xmath58 in fig.1 for some values of @xmath33 .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath145 can be in the observational bound for @xmath147 or @xmath148 when @xmath149 . in fig.2",
    ", @xmath145 is plotted for different values of the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath33 . in the regions of the parameters space which correspond to @xmath150",
    ", @xmath145 can be in the observational bound only when the absolute value of @xmath58 is large . for @xmath80 , @xmath145 crosses the boundary @xmath151 and the curvature fluid can appear as a phantom .",
    "in this work we have studied a class of generalized @xmath1 gravity models in which there is an explicit coupling between the ricci scalar and lagrangian density of matter systems via the arbitrary function @xmath4 . in general , due to this @xmath5-matter coupling , the matter stress tensor does not remain conserved . assuming a power - law form for the scale factor and the function @xmath4 , we have solved the ( non-)conservation equation in the two cases @xmath62 and @xmath82 . in the first case",
    ", there is a constant rate of energy transfer from curvature to the matter , as required by the second law of thermodynamics . in the second case ,",
    "however , there is nearly no energy transfer between the two components and matter stress tensor is conserved . in both cases",
    "there is no extra force in the geodesic equation as the choice @xmath25 leads to vanishing of the first term on the right hand side of the equation ( [ b7 ] ) .",
    "+ we then apply the model to a cosmological setting .",
    "there are two different cases according to evolution of matter energy density .",
    "when there is an interaction between matter and geometry , the evolution is given by ( [ b13 ] ) and the exponent @xmath58 can be both positive and negative for @xmath77 and @xmath81 , respectively , as inferred by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , we have shown that accelerated expansion is possible for @xmath152 which is exactly the same domain for which the cosmic speed - up can be realized for @xmath108 .",
    "thus in this case the model does not provide any improvement with respect to einstein gravity .",
    "+ on the other hand , when @xmath118 scales as ( [ b18 ] ) and the matter system is nearly conserved there is no constraint on the sign of @xmath58 coming from the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "thus accelerated expansion is possible both for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the latter case in which there is a cosmic acceleration despite the matter part satisfies energy conditions should be regarded as the only improvement that the present model provides with respect to einstein gravity . in this case , the equation of state parameter of the curvature fluid is constrained by observations so that there is a bound on the parameter @xmath58 for any given @xmath33 .",
