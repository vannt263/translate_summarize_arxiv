    "grbs are the most extreme explosive events in the universe .",
    "the initial prompt phase lasts typically less than 100 s and has an energy content of @xmath0 ergs , giving a luminosity that is a million times larger than the peak electromagnetic luminosity of a supernova .",
    "the grb name is a good one because their spectra peak in the gamma - ray band between @xmath1 kev and @xmath2 mev .",
    "the source of the energy powering the bursts is thought to be the gravitational collapse of matter to form a black hole or other compact object .",
    "grbs were discovered in the late 1960s by the vela satellites monitoring the nuclear test ban treaty between the us and the soviet union @xcite .",
    "it was slow progress for 20 years learning the origin of these brilliant flashes .",
    "gamma - ray instruments of the time had poor positioning capability so only wide - field , insensitive telescopes could follow - up the bursts to look for counterparts at other wavelengths . nothing",
    "associated with the grbs was seen in searches hours to days after their occurrence . in the 1990 s",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) onboard the compton gamma ray observation ( cgro ) obtained the positions of @xmath3 grbs and showed that they were uniformly distributed on the sky @xcite , indicating either an extragalactic or galactic - halo origin .",
    "batse also found that grbs separate into two duration classes , short and long grbs , with dividing line at @xmath4 s @xcite .",
    "the detection of x - ray afterglows and more accurate localizations delivered by the bepposax mission @xcite enabled optical redshifts of grbs to be measured and their extragalactic origin to be confirmed .",
    "the long bursts were found to be associated with far - away galaxies at typical redshifts @xmath5 , implying energy releases in excess of @xmath6 ergs , after taking into account the jet beaming factor .",
    "the afterglow time decay often steepened after a day indicating a geometrical beaming of the radiation into a jet of opening angle @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "key open issues prior to the swift and fermi era included : ( 1 ) the origin of short grbs , ( 2 ) the nature of the high energy radiation from grbs , ( 3 ) the redshift distribution of bursts and their usage for early universe studies , and ( 4 ) the physics of the jetted outflows .",
    "swift and fermi , launched in 2004 and 2008 respectively , have opened a new era in grb research .",
    "swift is a nasa mission and fermi a nasa collaboration with the us department of energy .",
    "they are both major international partnerships and have different and complementary capabilities .",
    "swift has a wide - field imaging camera in the hard x - ray band that detects the bursts at a rate of @xmath8 per year , providing positions with arcminute accuracy .",
    "the spacecraft then autonomously and rapidly ( 100 s ) reorients itself for sensitive x - ray and uv / optical observations of the afterglow .",
    "fermi has two wide - field instruments .",
    "one detects bursts in the gamma - ray band at a rate of @xmath9 per year , providing spectroscopy and positions with 10-degree accuracy .",
    "the other observes bursts in the largely - unexplored high - energy gamma - ray band at a rate of @xmath10 per year .",
    "combined , the two missions are advancing our understanding of all aspects of grbs , including the origin of short bursts , the nature of bursts coming from the explosion of early stars in the universe and the physics of the fireball outflows that produce the gamma - ray emission .",
    "the swift mission @xcite has three instruments : the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and the uv optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bat detects bursts and locates them to @xmath4 arcminute accuracy . the position is then sent to the spacecraft to repoint the xrt and uvot at the event .",
    "positions are also rapidly sent to the ground so that ground telescopes can follow the afterglows .",
    "there are more than 50 such telescopes of all sizes that participate in these world - wide follow - up campaigns .",
    "measurements of the redshift and studies of host galaxies are typically done with large ground - based telescopes , which receive immediate alerts from the spacecraft when grbs are detected .",
    "swift has , by far , detected the largest number of well - localized bursts with afterglow observations and redshift determinations .",
    "as of 1 september 2012 , bat has detected 709 grbs ( annual average rate of @xmath8 per year ) .",
    "approximately @xmath11 of the bat - detected grbs have rapid repointings ( the remaining @xmath12 have spacecraft constraints that prevent rapid slewing ) . of those ,",
    "virtually all long bursts observed promptly have detected x - ray afterglow .",
    "short bursts are more likely to have negligible x - ray afterglow , fading rapidly below the xrt sensitivity limit .",
    "the fraction of rapid - pointing grbs that have uvot detection is @xmath13 .",
    "combined with ground - based optical observations , about @xmath14 of swift grb have optical afterglow detection .",
    "there are 225 swift grbs with redshifts compared with 41 pre - swift .",
    "swift was specifically designed to investigate grb afterglows by filling the temporal gap between observations of the prompt emission and the afterglow @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : swiftxray ] shows example x - ray afterglows from xrt from long and short grbs @xcite . the combined power of the bat and xrt has revealed that in long grbs the non - thermal prompt x - ray emission smoothly transitions into the decaying afterglow . often , a steep - to - shallow transition is found suggesting that prompt emission and the afterglow are distinct emission components @xcite . the early steep - decay phase seen in the majority of grbs is a surprise .",
    "the current best explanation is that we are seeing high - latitude emission due to termination of central engine activity @xcite .",
    "swift has discovered erratic flaring behavior ( figure [ fig : swiftxray ] ) , lasting long after the prompt phase in @xmath15 of x - ray afterglows .",
    "the most extreme examples are flares with integrated power similar to or exceeding the initial burst @xcite .",
    "the rapid rise and decay , multiple flares in the same burst , and cases of fluence comparable with the prompt emission , suggest that these flares are due to the central engine .",
    "long grbs ( lgrbs ) are associated with the brightest regions of galaxies where the most massive stars occur @xcite .",
    "lgrbs occur over a large redshift range from @xmath16 ( grb 980425 ) to @xmath17 ( grb 090423 & grb 090429b ) . with few exceptions , lgrbs that occur near enough for supernova detection have accompanying type ib or ic supernovae .",
    "the exceptions are cases of bursts that may be misclassified as long or that may have exceptionally weak supernovae .",
    "these facts support the growing evidence that long bursts are caused by `` collapsars '' where the central core of a massive star collapses to a compact object such as a black hole @xcite or possibly a magnetar @xcite .",
    "theories for the origin of lgrbs predate swift , but are supported by the new data . in them ,",
    "a solar rest mass worth of gravitational energy is released in a very short time ( seconds or less ) in a small region of the order of tens of kilometers by a cataclysmic stellar event .",
    "the energy source is the collapse of the core of a massive star .",
    "only a small fraction of this energy is converted into electromagnetic radiation , through the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a collimated relativistic outflow , a fireball with bulk lorentz factors of @xmath18 , expanding out from the central engine powered by the gravitational accretion of surrounding matter into the collapsed core or black hole .",
    "mission & statistics  the fermi instruments are the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm , @xcite ) and the large area telescope ( lat , @xcite ) .",
    "the gbm has scintillation detectors and covers the energy range from 8 kev to 40 mev .",
    "it measures spectra of grbs and determines their position to @xmath19 accuracy .",
    "the lat is a pair conversion telescope covering the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev .",
    "it measures spectra of sources and positions them to an accuracy of @xmath20 .",
    "the gbm detects grbs at a rate of @xmath21 per year , of which on average @xmath12 are short bursts .",
    "the lat detects bursts at a rate of @xmath10 per year .",
    "lat bursts have shown two common and interesting features : ( 1 ) delayed emission compared to lower energy bands and ( 2 ) longer lasting prompt emission compared to lower every bands .",
    "the four brightest lat bursts are grb 080916c @xcite , grb 090510 @xcite , grb 090902b @xcite , and grb 090926a @xcite .",
    "they have yielded hundreds of @xmath22 mev photons each , and together with the lower energy gbm observations , have given unprecedented broad - band spectra . in grb 080916c , the gev emission appears only in a second pulse , delayed by @xmath23 s relative to the first pulse ( figure [ fig : lc080916c ] ) .",
    "such a delay is present also in short bursts , such as grb 090510 , where it is a fraction of a second .",
    "this soft - to - hard spectral evolution is clearly seen in all four of these bright lat bursts , and to various degrees a similar behavior is seen in other weaker lat bursts .        in some bursts , such as grb 080916c and several others , the broad - band gamma - ray spectra consist of a simple band - type broken power - law function in all time bins . in grb 080916c the first pulse has a soft high energy index disappearing at gev energies , while the second and subsequent pulses have harder high energy indices reaching into the multi - gev range . in some other bursts , such as grb 090510 @xcite and grb 090902b @xcite , a second hard spectral component extending above 10 gev without",
    "any obvious break appears in addition to common band spectral component dominant in the lower 8 kev-10 mev band .    an exciting discovery , unanticipated by results from the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) instrument on cgro , was the detection of high - energy emission from two short bursts ( grb 081024b @xcite and grb 090510 @xcite ) .",
    "their general behavior ( including a gev delay ) is qualitatively similar to that of long bursts .",
    "the ratio of detection rates of short to long grbs by lat is @xmath24 ( 2 out of 27 ) , which is significantly smaller than the @xmath25 by gbm .    while the statistics on short grbs are too small to draw firm conclusions , so far , the ratio of the lat fluence to the gbm fluence is @xmath26 for the short bursts as compared to @xmath27@xmath28 for the long bursts .",
    "it is also noteworthy that , for both long and short grbs , the @xmath29 mev emission lasts longer than the gbm emission in the @xmath30 mev range .",
    "the flux of the long - lived lat emission decays as a power law with time , which is more reminiscent of the smooth temporal decay of the afterglow x - ray and optical fluxes rather than the variable temporal structure in the prompt kev  mev flux .",
    "this similarity in the smooth temporal evolution of the fluxes in different wave bands has been detected most clearly in grb 090510 @xcite although this burst also requires a separate prompt component to the lat emission @xcite .",
    "this short burst was at @xmath31 , and was jointly observed by the lat , gbm , bat , xrt and uvot .    the lat detects only @xmath32 of the bursts triggered by the gbm which were in the common gbm - lat field of view .",
    "this may be related to the fact that the lat - detected grbs , both long and short , are generally among the highest fluence bursts , as well as being among the intrinsically most energetic grbs .",
    "for instance , grb 080916c was at @xmath33 and had an isotropic - equivalent energy of @xmath34 ergs in gamma rays , the largest ever measured from any burst @xcite .",
    "the long lat bursts grb 090902b @xcite at @xmath35 had @xmath36 ergs , while grb 090926a @xcite at @xmath37 had @xmath38 ergs .",
    "even the short burst grb 090510 at @xmath39 produced , within the first 2 s , an @xmath40 ergs @xcite .",
    "swift is detecting grbs at higher redshift than previous missions due to its higher sensitivity and rapid afterglow observations .",
    "the average redshift for the swift grbs is 2.3 compared to 1.2 for previous observations .",
    "although statistics are poor , the highest redshift grbs are seen to have high luminosity , resulting in fluxes well above the detection threshold .",
    "such bursts are also strong at other wavelengths .",
    "table 1 presents optical data for the highest redshift grbs observed to date .",
    "the optical brightness is given in magnitudes in @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 wavelength bands .",
    "the bursts are 34 orders of magnitude brighter than typical galaxies at these redshift .    to date",
    ", swift has seen seven grbs with @xmath45 .",
    "the highest @xmath46 grbs so far are @xmath47 ( grb 050904 @xcite ) , @xmath48 ( grb 080913 @xcite ) , @xmath49 ( grb 090423 @xcite ) , and @xmath50 ( grb 090429b @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig:090423 ] shows a spectrum of the current record holder with a spectroscopic redshift , grb 090423 @xcite .",
    "because grbs are so bright across the electromagnetic spectrum , they are excellent tools for studying the high redshift universe .",
    "the information that can be provided by grbs is complementary to what can be learned by studies of galaxies and quasars . for example , at @xmath51 it is expected that the bulk of the star formation activity is taking place in small galaxies below the detection limits of hst .",
    "the chemical evolution of the universe can be studied with grbs as illustrated in figure [ fig : metallicity ] @xcite .",
    "grbs provide data to higher redshift than active galaxies .",
    "the metallicity bias of grbs is currently contradictory .",
    "plots like figure [ fig : metallicity ] show grbs in higher metallicity star forming regions of galaxies .",
    "however , comparing star forming regions , grbs actually tend to favor ones with lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "another way that grbs are contributing to our understanding of the high - redshift universe is in the determination of the star formation history ( figure [ fig : starformation ] ) .",
    "lgrbs are the endpoints of the lives of massive stars and their rate is therefore approximately proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "they give information at high redshift where the rate is highly uncertain . there may be evolutionary biases , such as a dependence of lgrbs on the metallicity of host galaxies , so studies relating them to the star formation rate must include these factors into account @xcite .",
    ".optical observations of high redshift grbs [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      at the time of swift s launch , the greatest mystery of grb astronomy was the nature of short - duration , hard - spectrum bursts ( sgrbs ) .",
    "although more than 50 long grbs had afterglow detections , no afterglow had been found for any short burst . in summer 2005",
    "swift and hete-2 , precisely located three short bursts for which afterglow observations were obtained leading to a breakthrough in our understanding of short bursts @xcite . as of 2012 , bat has detected 65 sgrbs , @xmath11 of which have xrt detections , and 15 of which have redshifts .",
    "in contrast to long bursts , the evidence is that sgrbs typically originate in host galaxies with a wide range of star formation properties , including low formation rate .",
    "their host properties are substantially different than those of long bursts @xcite indicating a different origin .",
    "also , nearby sgrbs show no evidence for simultaneous supernovae ( @xcite ; and references therein ) , very different than long bursts .",
    "taken together , these results support the interpretation that sgrbs arise from an old populations of stars and are due to mergers of compact binaries ( i.e. , double neutron star or neutron star - black hole ) @xcite .",
    "it is possible that there is a subpopulation of high - redshift , high - luminosity short grbs with a different origin @xcite .",
    "measurements or constraining limits on beaming from light curve break searches have been hard to come by with the typically weak afterglow of sgrbs . with large uncertainties associated with small number statistics",
    ", the distribution of beaming angles for sgrbs appears to range from @xmath19 to @xmath52 @xcite , roughly consistent but perhaps somewhat larger than that of lgrbs .",
    "swift observations also revealed long ( @xmath1 s ) `` tails '' with softer spectra than the first episode following the prompt emission for about @xmath53 of short bursts @xcite .",
    "swift localization of a short grb helps narrow the search window for gravitational waves from that grb @xcite .",
    "detection of gravitational waves from a swift grb would lead to great scientific payoff for merger physics , progenitor types , and ns equations of state .",
