    "turbulence is ubiquitous and plays a critical role for the plasma stability and confinement properties of fusion devices , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the tokamak edge region .",
    "turbulence is a regime of fluid , gas and plasma flows characterized by its highly nonlinear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a chaotic , _ i.e. _ , unpredictible behavior and rotational motion all along a wide range of dynamically active scales .",
    "in contrast to classical dynamical systems , which are low dimensional and conservative , a turbulent flow is a dissipative dynamical system , whose behavior is governed by a very large , even maybe infinite , number of degrees of freedom .",
    "each field , _",
    "e.g. _ , velocity , vorticity , magnetic field or current density , strongly fluctuates around a mean value and one observes that these fluctuations tend to self - organize into so - called coherent structures , _",
    "i.e. _ , vortex tubes in hydrodynamics and vorticty sheets and current sheets in magnehydrodynamics ( mhd )",
    ". the presence of coherent structures results in the strong spatial and temporal flow intermittency , which is a key feature of turbulence .",
    "intermittency is understood here that the fluctuations become stronger for decreasing scale and are hence more localized .",
    "the appropriate tool to study intermittency is the wavelet representation due to its intrinsic multiscale nature .",
    "indeed , it yields a sparse multiscale representation of intermittent fields since wavelets are well localized functions in both physical and fourier space .",
    "the classical theory of homogeneous turbulence @xcite assumes that turbulent flows are statistically stationary and homogeneous .",
    "this allows to use the fourier space representation to analyze it ( _ e.g. _ , the energy spectrum is the modulus of the fourier transform of the velocity auto - correlation ) , to model it ( _ e.g. _ , using large eddy simulation ) and to compute it ( _ e.g. _ , using spectral methods ) .",
    "hence , since the fourier representation spreads information among the phases of all fourier coefficients , the structural information ( _ i.e. _ , locality in time and in space ) is lost when one considers only the modulus of the fourier coefficients , as usually done .",
    "this is a major drawback of the classical theory of turbulence and the reason why we proposed in 1988 @xcite to replace the fourier representation by the wavelet representation to define new analysis and computational tools able to preserve time and space local information .",
    "if the fourier representation is well suited to study linear dynamical systems ( whose behaviour either persists at the initial scale or spreads over larger ones ) , it is not the case for nonlinear dynamical systems for which the superposition principle no more holds ( _ i.e. _ , they can not be decomposed into a sum of independent subsystems to be separately studied ) .",
    "moreover , the evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems develop over a wide range of scales , since energy is spread from the initially excited scale towards smaller and smaller ones ( the so - called energy cascade ) until finite - time singularities develop ( _ e.g. _ , shocks ) , unless some dissipative mechanisms damp energy and thus avoid its ultra - violet divergence .",
    "the art of predicting the evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems consists of disentangling their active components from their passive components , the former being deterministically computed while the latter being discarded or statistically modeled .",
    "one thus performs a distillation process to only retain the components essential to predict the nonlinear behaviour .",
    "the wavelet representation is particularly appropriate for this since it allows to track the evolution in both space and scale and to only retain the degrees of freedom in charge of the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "turbulent flows are archetypes of nonlinear dynamical systems and therefore good candidates to be analyzed , modelled and computed using the wavelet representation .",
    "if we now focus on plasma turbulence we are uneasy about the fact that we have two different descriptions , depending on which side of the fourier transform we look from .    * on the one hand , we have a theory @xcite that assumes a nonlinear cascade in fourier space for a range of scales , the so - called ` inertial range ' , where the flow kinetic energy is statistically ( _ i.e. _ , for ensemble or time or space averages ) transferred towards smaller scales until reaching kolmogorov s scale where molecular dissipation transforms kinetic energy into heat . under these hypotheses ,",
    "the theory predicts a power - law behaviour for the modulus of the energy spectrum in the inertial range .",
    "* on the other hand , if we study the flow in physical space we do not have yet a predictive theory but only empirical observations ( from laboratory and numerical experiments ) showing the emergence and persistence of coherent structures , _ e.g.",
    "_ , blobs and current sheets that concentrate most of the kinetic and magnetic energy , even for very high reynolds number flows .    the classical methods for modeling turbulent flows , _ e.g. _ , large eddy simulation ( les ) ,",
    "suppose a scale separation ( _ i.e. _ , a spectral gap ) and neglect the small scale motions , although their effect onto the large scale motions is statistically modelled ( supposing their dynamics to be linear or slaved to them ) . unfortunately for those methods we have strong evidence , from both laboratory and numerical experiments , that there is no spectral gap since all scales of the inertial range are coupled and nonlinearly interact .",
    "moreover , one observes that coherent structures play a major dynamical role and are responsible for the transport and mixing properties of turbulent flows .",
    "in consequence one might ask the following questions : are coherent structures the dynamical building blocks of turbulent flows and can we extract them ? if we succeed to do so , would it be possible to represent them with a reduced number of degrees of freedom and would those be sufficient to compute the flow nonlinear dynamics ?    the aim of this review is to offer a primer on wavelets for both continuous and orthogonal transforms .",
    "we then detail different diagnostics based on wavelet coefficients to analyze and to compress turbulent flows by extracting coherent structures .",
    "examples for experimental data from the tokamak tore supra ( cadarache , france ) and numerical simulation data of resistive drift - wave and mhd turbulence , illustrate the wavelet tools .",
    "wavelet - based density estimation techniques to improve particle - in - cell numerical schemes are presented , together with a particle - in - wavelet scheme that we developed for solving the vlasov ",
    "poisson equations directly in wavelet space .",
    "coherent vorticity and current sheet simulation ( cvcs ) , that applies wavelet filtering to the resistive non - ideal mhd equations , is proposed as a new model for turbulent mhd flows .",
    "it allows to reduce the number of degrees of freedom necessary to compute them , while capturing the nonlinear dynamics of the flow .",
    "this review is based on the work and publications we have performed within the last 15 years , in collaboration with the cea - cadarache and other teams in france , japan and united states . almost all material presented here",
    "has already been published in some of our papers ( cited in the references ) , and parts have been adapted for this review .",
    "let us only mention few references of wavelet techniques that have been used to analyze and quantify plasma turbulence : _",
    "e.g. _ , transients @xcite , bicoherence @xcite , intermittency @xcite and anisotropy @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of our paper and we focus here exclusively on our contributions .",
    "the outline of this review is the following : first , in section  2 we present wavelet analysis tools , including a short primer on continuous and orthogonal wavelets .",
    "statistical tools in wavelet coefficient space are also introduced .",
    "section  3 focusses on coherent structure extraction using wavelet - based denoising .",
    "wavelet - based simulation schemes are reviewed in section  4 and section  5 draws some conclusions .",
    "the wavelet transform @xcite unfolds any signal ( _ e.g. _ , in time ) or any field ( _ e.g. _ , in three - dimensional space ) into both space ( or time ) and scale ( or time scale ) , and possibly directions ( for dimensions higher than one ) .",
    "the building block of the wavelet transform is the ` mother wavelet ' , @xmath0 with @xmath1 , that is a well - localized function with fast decay at infinity and at least one vanishing moment ( _ i.e. _ , zero mean ) or more .",
    "it is also smooth enough in order its fourier transform , @xmath2 , exhibits fast decay for @xmath3 tending to infinity . from the mother wavelet one then generates a family of wavelets , translated by @xmath4 , the position parameter , dilated ( or contracted ) by @xmath5 , the scale parameter , and normalized in @xmath6-norm ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath7 ) to obtain the set @xmath8 the wavelet transform of @xmath9 is the inner product of @xmath10 with the analyzing wavelets @xmath11 , and the wavelet coefficients , that measure the fluctuations of @xmath10 at scale @xmath12 and position @xmath13 , are @xmath14 with @xmath15 denoting the complex conjugate .",
    "the function @xmath10 is reconstructed from its wavelet coefficients , as the inner product of @xmath16 with the set of analyzing wavelets @xmath11 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant that depends on the wavelet @xmath19 .",
    "similarly to the fourier transform , the wavelet transform corresponds to a change of basis ( from physical space to wavelet space ) and , since it is an isometry , it preserves the inner product ( @xmath20 ) ( plancherel s theorem ) and conserves energy ( parseval s identity ) , therefore @xmath21 note that the wavelet coefficients of the continuous wavelet transform are redundant and therefore correlated .",
    "this could be illustrated by the patterns one observes within the continuous wavelet coefficients of a white noise , which correspond to the correlation between the dilated and translated wavelets ( the white noise being decorrelated by construction ) and visualizes the ` reproducing kernel ' of the continuous wavelet transform .",
    "due to the fact that wavelets are well localized in physical space , the behaviour of the signal at infinity does not play any role .",
    "therefore both wavelet analysis and wavelet synthesis can be performed locally , in contrast to the fourier transform which is intrinsically non local ( fourier modes are spread all over space ) .",
    "one can also construct peculiar wavelets on a dyadic grid @xmath22 ( _ i.e. _ , scale is sampled by octaves @xmath23 and space by positions @xmath24 ) that are orthogonal to each other and are used to construct wavelet orthonormal bases .",
    "in contrast to the continuous wavelet coefficients eq .",
    "( [ continuouswt ] ) that are redundant and correlated , the orthogonal wavelet coefficients are decorrelated and non redundant ( _ i.e. _ , a signal sampled on @xmath25 points is perfectly represented by @xmath25 orthogonal wavelet coefficients only ) . as for the fourier transform",

    "the wavelet series becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the scaling function and @xmath47 the corresponding scaling coefficients .",

    "we propose a wavelet - based method to extract coherent structures that emerge out of turbulent flows , both in fluids ( _ e.g. _ , vortices , shock waves in compressible fluids , ... ) and in plasmas ( _ e.g. _ , bursts , blobs , ... ) .",
    "the goal is to study their role regarding the transport and mixing properties of flows in the turbulent regime .    for this",
    ", we use the wavelet representation that keeps track of both time and scale , instead of the fourier representation that keeps track of frequency only .",
    "since there is not yet an universal definition of the coherent structures encountered in turbulent flows , we use an apophatic method ( introduced in hinduist theology several thousands years ago ) where one does not try to define what an entity ( _ e.g. _ , a phenomenon , a noumenon , ... ) is but rather what it is not .",
    "we thus agree on the minimal and hopefully consensual statement : _",
    "coherent structures are not noise _ , and propose to define them as : _",
    "coherent structures are what remains after denoising_.    the mathematical definition of noise states that a signal is a noise if it can not be compressed in any functional basis . as a result",
    "the shortest description of a noise is itself .",
    "note that in most of the cases the experimental noise generated by a measure device does not fit the definition of mathematical noise since it could be compressed in at least one functional basis ( _ e.g. _ , parasite frequencies can be removed in the fourier basis ) .",
    "this new way of defining coherent structures allows to process signals and fields , but also their cuts or projections ( _ e.g. _ , a probe located at one point provides a one dimensional cut of a four dimensional space - time field ) .",
    "indeed , the algorithms commonly used to extract coherent structures can not work for cuts or projections , because they require a template of the structures to extract ( one would need to take into account how the probe sees all possible translations and distortions of the coherent structures ) .",
    "the strength of our algorithm is that it treats fields and projections the same way .",
    "since we assume that coherent structures are what remains after denoising , we need a model , not for the structures themselves , but for the noise . applying ` ockham s razor principle ' ( or the ` law of parsimony ' ) , we choose as first guess the simplest possible model : we suppose the noise to be additive , gaussian and white ( _ i.e. _ , uncorrelated ) .",
    "we then project the turbulent signal ( in 1d ) , or turbulent field ( in higher dimensions ) , into wavelet space and retain only the coefficients having their modulus larger than a given threshold . as threshold value we follow donoho and johnstone s proposition of a threshold value that depends on the variance of the gaussian noise we want to remove and on the chosen sampling rate @xcite . since the noise variance is not known _ a priori _ for turbulent signals ( the noise being produced by their intrinsic nonlinear dynamics ) , we designed a recursive method @xcite to estimate it from the variance of the weakest wavelet coefficients , _",
    "i.e. _ , those whose modulus is below the threshold value . after applying our algorithm we obtain two orthogonal fields : the coherent field retaining all coherent structures and the incoherent field corresponding to the noise .",
    "we then check _ a posteriori _ that the latter is indeed noise - like ( _ i.e. _ , spread all over physical space ) , gaussian and uncorrelated ( _ i.e. _ , also spread all over fourier space ) , and thus confirm the hypotheses we have _ a priori _ chosen for the noise .",
    "we consider a signal @xmath184 sampled on @xmath49 points that we want to denoise , assuming the noise to be additive , gaussian and white .",

    "we retain only the wavelet coefficients whose modulus is larger than a threshold value .",

    "if we do not _ a priori _ know the variance of the noise , that is the most usual case , one should use the wavelet - based recursive algorithm we proposed in 1999 @xcite .",
    "this algorithm first estimates the variance of the noise by considering the variance of the noisy signal @xmath188 and computes the corresponding threshold @xmath189 the algorithm splits the wavelet coefficients into two classes : the weak coefficients whose modulus is smaller than the threshold , and the remaining strong coefficients .",

    "we proposed a wavelet - based method for noise reduction in the reconstruction of particle distribution functions from particle simulation data , called wavelet - based density estimation ( wbde ) .",
    "the method was originally introduced in @xcite in the context of statistics to estimate probability densities given a finite number of independent measurements .",
    "wbde , as used in @xcite , is based on a truncation of the wavelet representation of the dirac delta function associated with each particle .",
    "the method yields almost optimal results for functions with unknown local smoothness without compromising computational efficiency , assuming that the particles ' coordinates are statistically independent .",
    "it can be viewed as a natural extension of the finite size particles ( fsp ) approach , with the advantage of estimating more accurately distribution functions that have localized sharp features .",
    "the proposed method preserves the moments of the particle distribution function to a good level of accuracy , has no constraints on the dimensionality of the system , does not require an a priori selection of a global smoothing scale , and is able to adapt locally to the smoothness of the density based on the given discrete particle data .",
    "indeed , the projection space is determined from the data itself , which allows for a refined representation around sharp features , and could make the method more precise than pic for a given computational cost .",
    "moreover , the computational cost of the denoising stage is of the same order as one time step of a fsp simulation .",
    "the underlying idea of wbde is to expand the sampled particle distribution function , represented by a histogram , into an orthogonal wavelet basis using the fast wavelet transform .",
    "we define the empirical density associated to the particles positions @xmath295 for @xmath296 where @xmath293 is the number of particles , @xmath297 and where @xmath298 is the dirac measure .",

    "the remaining wavelet coefficients are then thresholded retaining only those whose modulus is larger than the scale - dependent threshold @xmath302 , where @xmath273 is a constant which depends on the regularity of the solution @xcite . finally the denoised particle density is obtained by applying an inverse fast wavelet transform . in @xcite daubechies wavelets with 6 vanishing moments were used .",
    "in @xcite we treated three cases in order to test how the efficiency of the denoising algorithm depends on the level of collisionality of the plasma . a strongly collisional ,",
    "weakly collisional and collisionless regimes were considered . for the strongly collisional regime we computed particle data of force - free collisional relaxation involving energy and pinch - angle scattering .",
    "the collisionless regime is studied using pic - data corresponding to bump - on - tail and two - stream instabilities in the vlasov  poisson system .",

    "non - dimensional form the equations read @xmath303 where @xmath46 is electric potential .",
    "the particle distribution function @xmath10 is discretized using tracer particles , and the charge distribution is reconstructed using wavelet - based density estimation ( wbde ) , discussed in the previous section .",
    "the latter consists in projecting the delta distributions corresponding to the particles onto a finite dimensional linear space spanned by a family of wavelets , which is chosen adaptively .",

    "different adaption strategies to select the optimal saftey zone for cvcs have been studied .",
    "we tested the influence of the safety zone and of the threshold , as defined in section  3.1.3 , by considering three cases :    * cvcs0 with safety zone but without iterating the threshold @xmath193 , * cvcs1 with safety zone but with iterating the threshold once @xmath310 , * cvcs2 without safety zone but without iterating the threshold @xmath193 ,    details can be found in  @xcite .",
