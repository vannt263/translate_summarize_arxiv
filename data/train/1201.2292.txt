    "it is often claimed that both internet traffic and capacity undergo multiplicative year - on - year increase . such a rate may not be sustainable over time , even so",
    ", it is a pervasive point that the internet s demand and service rate changes multiplicatively .",
    "given this , in what way should a communication networks resources be allocated inorder to scale with such multiplicative effects ?",
    "mo and walrand @xcite introduced a parametrized family of utility functions called the _",
    "weighted @xmath0-fair utility functions_. a utility function orders the preferences of different network states : a network state is better than a second network state if it has higher utility . when maximized over a network s capacity set",
    ", a utility function provides a solution which can be used to allocate network resources .",
    "congestion control protocols such as tcp are argued to allocate bandwidth in this way @xcite , and congestion protocol models have been designed that provably reach such an operating point @xcite .",
    "suppose that a performance improvement is made whereby the network capacity is doubled .",
    "although capacity increases , the criteria by which capacity is evaluated and shared should remain the proportionate .",
    "we note that , in particular , the weighted @xmath0-fair utility functions obey this scaling property . but are there more ?",
    "such a utility function should , also , scale well when the traffic increases .",
    "that is , multiplicatively increasing the number of network flows should not alter the preferred allocation of network resources .",
    "this is a desirable property : regardless of relative changes , the proportion of network resource each route receives remains the same .",
    "given that the internet traffic is increasing multiplicatively , it is desirable that each flow has a share of resource that remains proportionate . once again , the weighted @xmath0-fair utility functions will scale in this way .",
    "so are the weighted @xmath0-fair utility functions the only utility functions that satisfy these scalability properties ?",
    "we mathematically formulate scaling properties and general settings where this is provably true .",
    "we thus provide a theoretical basis to the claim that , if bandwidth is allocated according to a network utility function which scales with relative network changes , then that utility function must be a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function , and hence , a control protocol that is robust to the future relative changes in network capacity and usage must to allocate bandwidth inorder to maximize a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",
    "economists arrow @xcite and pratt @xcite formulated the utility functions that satisfy a certain _ iso - elastic property_. in words , an individual is iso - elastic if his preferences enter a bet are unaltered by a multiplicative changes in the bet s stakes and rewards .",
    "arrow and pratt parametrize the set of iso - elastic utility functions on @xmath1 .",
    "it is an immediate check that the iso - elastic utility functions are precisely the summands of a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",
    "thus the reason a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function has good scaling properties is because of the iso - elasticity property inherent in its summands .",
    "but conversely , if a utility function allocates network resources proportionately then must it be weighted @xmath0-fair ? the main results of this paper provide settings where scaling properties are equivalent to a utility function being weight @xmath0-fair .",
    "the work of mo and walrand has received a great deal of attention .",
    "this is chiefly because a number of known network fairness criteria correspond to maximizing a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function : known internet equilibria , _ tcp fairness _",
    "@xcite , for @xmath2 ; the work kelly @xcite , weighted proportional fairness , for @xmath3 ; the work of bertsemas and gallager @xcite , max - min fairness , for @xmath4 with @xmath5 and maximum throughput for @xmath4 with @xmath6 .",
    "but , perhaps , the explicit reason for the attention on weighted @xmath0-fairness has not been the above iso - elastic property .",
    "the iso - elastic property is frequently exploited inorder to studying the limit and stability behaviour of associated stochastic network models @xcite ; some authors have begun to explicitly cite the iso - elastic property @xcite , and other authors have attempted to derive weighted @xmath0-fairness and other fairness criteria from axiomatic properties @xcite .",
    "even so , there appears to be little discussion of this iso - elastic scaling property , its equivalence with weighted @xmath0-fairness , and what this implies for the performance achieved by a communication network and associated stochastic models .",
    "addressing this point is the principle contribution of this paper .",
    "the results and sections of this paper are organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "net ] , we define the topology and capacity constraints of a communication network . in section [ sec : netutil ] , we define what we mean by a network utility function , network utility maximization and we define the weighted @xmath0-fair utility functions . in section [ sec : iso ] , we formally define the network iso - elasticity property and the flow scalability property . in section [ sec : isothrm ] , we prove that a network utility function is network iso - elastic iff it is weighted @xmath0-fair . in section [ sec :",
    "scale ] , we consider a network topology where each link has some dedicate local traffic flow . on this topology",
    ", we show that a network utility maximizing allocation satisfies flow scalability iff it is a weighted @xmath0-fair maximizer . in section [ sec : access ] , in addition to the flow scalability property , we define an access scalability property .",
    "we prove the only utility functions that are flow scalable and access scalable are the weighted @xmath0-fair utility functions . in proving these results we lay claim to the statement that if bandwidth is allocated according to a network utility function which scales with relative network changes then that utility function must be a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",
    "thus a control protocol that is robust to the future relative changes in network capacity and usage must allocate bandwidth to maximize a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",
    "we define the topology and capacity constraints of a network .",
    "we suppose that there are a set of links indexed by @xmath7 . the positive vector @xmath8 gives the capacity of each link in the network .",
    "a route consists of a set of links .",
    "we let @xmath9 denote the set of routes .",
    "the topology of the network is defined through a @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 .",
    "we let @xmath12 if route @xmath13 uses link @xmath14 and we let @xmath15 otherwise . we let the positive vector @xmath16 denote the bandwidth allocated to each route . at link",
    "@xmath14 these must satisfy the capacity constraint @xmath17 and thus the set feasible bandwidth allocations is given by @xmath18",
    "in communication network , we could allocate resources to achieve the highest aggregate throughput .",
    "although a high data rate is achieved , some networks flows maybe be starved . over the last decade ,",
    "there has been interest in allocating network resources in a _",
    "fair _ way .",
    "essentially , fairness is achieved by allocating a positive share of the networks resources to each flow . to achieve this",
    "it was recommended to allocate resources inorder to maximize utility , see kelly @xcite .",
    "in such a network , each flow expresses its demand via a strictly increasing concave utility function .",
    "a utility function will have a higher slope for smaller throughputs . when maximized , this function can be used express a higher demand for the networks resources .",
    "thus , from this , a form of fairness is achieved .",
    "the average utility of a network flow is @xmath19 here @xmath9 indexes the routes of a network ; @xmath20 gives the number of flows present on route @xmath13 ; @xmath21 gives the flow rate allocated to route @xmath13 , which is then shared equally amongst the flows present on the route , and finally , @xmath22 gives the utility function of each route @xmath13 user .",
    "we call a utility function of the form , a _ network utility function_.    we assume throughout this paper that each utility function @xmath22 is increasing , once differentiable and strictly concave .    to the average user , a network utility function orders preferences of different network states , i.e.",
    ", @xmath23 is as least as good as @xmath24 if @xmath25 . given the flows present in a network , the best network state is one that maximizes utility .",
    "that is , @xmath26 the optimum of the _ network utility maximization_. @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the set of feasible bandwidth allocations . in general ,",
    "set of bandwith allocations will depend on the topology and capacity constraints of a communication network .",
    "the _ weighted @xmath0-fair _ utility functions introduced by mo and walrand @xcite are given by @xmath29 for @xmath30 and parametrized by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "as mentioned , the weighted @xmath0-fair class has proved popular as it provides a spectrum of fairness criteria which contains proportional fairness ( @xmath33 ) , tcp fairness ( @xmath2 , @xmath34 ) , and converges to a maximum throughput solution ( @xmath6 , @xmath35 ) and max - min fairness ( @xmath5 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "we now define the two main scaling properties which we will use : network iso - elasticity and flow scalability .",
    "both encapsulate a simple idea , if we multiplicatively change the available network capacity then we will allocate resources proportionately .",
    "a network utility function ranks the set of network states through the ordering induced by @xmath25 .",
    "we say a network utility function is network iso - elastic if this ordering is unchanged by a multiplicative increase in the available bandwidth .",
    "more formally ,    we define a utility function to be _ network iso - elastic _ if , @xmath36 , @xmath37 for each @xmath38 .",
    "we note that this is equivalent to the expression , where we multiplicatively scale the number of flows , @xmath36 , @xmath39 for each @xmath38 .",
    "network iso - elasticity requires that the utility of each network state @xmath23 scales .",
    "what if we only wish the optimal allocation to scale ?",
    "we say a utility function optimized on capacity set @xmath40 is _ flow scalable _ if @xmath26 the solution to the optimization problem is such that @xmath41    that is the bandwidth allocated to each route is unchanged by multiplicative changes in the number of flows on each route . making explicit that @xmath42 is the solution to when optimizing over @xmath40 and defining @xmath43 .",
    "we note that network scalability condition is equivalent to the condition that allocated bandwidth scales proportionately with capacity increases , i.e. , @xmath44",
    "in this section , we prove the first result of this paper .",
    "we prove a network utility function satisfying this iso - elastic property is , up to an additive constant , a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",

    "we now prove conversely that i ) implies ii ) .",
    "the key idea is to prove that the map @xmath48 is linear .",

    "one can see the value of the utility function @xmath57 induces an ordering on the set of pairs @xmath23 .",
    "network iso - elasticity states that , @xmath36 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 induce the same ordering on elements @xmath60",
    ". thus implies , for each @xmath61 , there exists an increasing function @xmath62 such that @xmath63    now let us show that @xmath64 is linear .",
    "let @xmath65 be the random variable such that @xmath66 let @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note @xmath69 .",
    "now observe @xmath70 thus @xmath64 is an increasing linear function and so , for @xmath61 , @xmath71 for some @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "statement applies to @xmath74 , for @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath75 we wish to remove the seemingly arbitrary functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 . differentiating with respect to @xmath78 gives , @xmath79 as @xmath80 is a decreasing function it is differentiable at at least one point ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.2.7 ) .",
    "differentiating again at this point gives @xmath81 thus , as @xmath82 is arbitrary , @xmath83 exists for all @xmath84 .",
    "dividing both terms leads to the equation @xmath85 taking @xmath86 and defining @xmath87 , we have the differential equation @xmath88 dividing both sides by @xmath82 and integrating with respect to @xmath82 gives @xmath89 here @xmath90 is an appropriate additive constant . integrating one more time gives and letting @xmath91 gives @xmath92    it remains to show @xmath93 for all @xmath52 .",
    "observe that includes the statement @xmath94 iff @xmath95 , which can only hold if @xmath96 .",
    "so @xmath97 for some @xmath31 and thus for all @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath100 as required .",
    "we note that an almost identical result and proof holds for the aggregate utility function @xmath101 the only exception would be that the above result does not hold for the weighted proportionally fair case ( where @xmath3 ) .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that flow scalability is equivalent to optimizing a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function for two specific network topologies : a linear network and a network satisfying the local traffic condition .",
    "a _ linear network _ consist of a routes @xmath102 and links @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "route @xmath105 uses all the links , @xmath106 , whilst for @xmath107 each route @xmath108 only uses link @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 otherwise . the _ local traffic condition _ insists that each link has a route that uses that link only , @xmath112 @xmath113 such that @xmath12 and @xmath114 @xmath115 .",
    "we will also assume a network that satisfies the local traffic condition has two or more links and is connected , that is for all links @xmath116 there exists a sequence of links and routes @xmath117 such that @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "we now prove that flow scalability is equivalent to weighted @xmath0-fairness for linear networks .",
    "[ linear theorem ] assuming , for @xmath52 , @xmath122 has range @xmath123 , a linear network is flow scalable iff it maximizes a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",
    "it is immediate that the weighted @xmath0-fair utility is flow scalable .",
    "let us show the converse .",
    "the bandwidth a linear network allocates is the solution to the optimization @xmath124 here , we let @xmath125 denote the capacity of the link on the intersection of route @xmath108 and route @xmath105 . assuming @xmath126 @xmath127 , the solution to this optimization satisfies @xmath128 if the solution is flow scalable then @xmath129 must also satisfy @xmath130    we observe that the solutions for a linear network allow a suitably large array of values for @xmath131 and @xmath21 . in particular , for any @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we can choose a @xmath126 such that @xmath134 , @xmath107 .",
    "letting @xmath135 , we can also chose @xmath136 such that @xmath137 .",
    "thus , this choice of @xmath129 gives the unique solution to for the @xmath55 given .",
    "the remainder of the proof is similar to that of theorem [ iso thrm ] .",
    "once again , the key idea is to prove the map @xmath138 is linear . as @xmath122 must be continuous and decreasing @xmath139 is an increasing continuous function .",
    "also , note that @xmath140 because @xmath141 .",
    "with @xmath142 as above , and state that @xmath143 taking @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 , we see that @xmath148 taking @xmath144 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 , and together imply @xmath152 as @xmath153 is increasing it is differentiable at some point ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.2.7 ) ) , then by it is differentiable at all points and moreover its derivative is constant . in otherwords , @xmath154 must be linear , @xmath155 for some function @xmath76 .",
    "thus @xmath156    by same argument used to derive from in theorem [ iso thrm ] , we have that @xmath157 @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "finally note , if @xmath161 for some @xmath108 then the equalities and can not hold , for all @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we now see the optimization ( [ linear fn]-[linear fn2 ] ) must have been a weighted @xmath0-fair optimization .    from this argument for linear networks , we extend our result to any network satisfying the local traffic condition .    assuming , for @xmath52 , @xmath122 has range @xmath123 , a network satisfying is the local traffic condition is flow scalable iff it maximizes a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",
    "it is immediate that the weighted @xmath0-fair utility is flow scalable . to show the converse , we show a local traffic network",
    "can be reduced to a linear network .",
    "take any route @xmath162 which uses two or more links .",
    "let them be @xmath103 and let @xmath163 be local traffic routes for each respective link .",
    "set @xmath164 for all @xmath165 .",
    "the resulting network is a linear network , and thus , by theorem [ linear theorem ] , the utility function associated with each route of this subnetwork is of the form @xmath157 @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 . here",
    "@xmath166 is same for all routes in this linear subnetwork , i.e. @xmath167 for all @xmath107 .",
    "we show , that since our network is connected , @xmath166 does not depend on the route chosen .",
    "we know @xmath168 for each local traffic route @xmath169 intersecting route @xmath13 .",
    "take two routes @xmath13 and @xmath170 .",
    "since our network is connect , for @xmath14 a link on route @xmath13 and @xmath171 a link on route @xmath170 , there are a sequence @xmath117 connecting @xmath118 and @xmath119 . for each @xmath172 ,",
    "the subnetwork formed by @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath173 and their respective local traffic routes forms a linear network .",
    "thus @xmath166 is constant across all routes and associated local traffic routes in the sequences @xmath117 .",
    "this , thus , implies @xmath174 .    by simply adding a local traffic route to each link , any network topology can be made to satisfy the local traffic condition .",
    "thus given the generality of this set of networks , it is natural to conjecture that flow scalability is equivalent to weighted @xmath0-fairness for any network topology .",
    "a network is flow scalable iff it maximizes a weighted @xmath0-fair utility function .",
    "the network utility maximization problem is @xmath175 given the flows on each route @xmath55 , this finds an optimal way to allocate bandwidth @xmath129 .",
    "given the bandwidth to be allocated is @xmath129 , what is the optimal number of flows permissible on each route ? this leads to the maximization @xmath176 in this second optimization , we optimize the number of flows accessing routes inorder to guarantee the maximum average utility per flow .",
    "flow scalability ( [ flow scale 1]-[flow scale 2 ] ) says , if we multiply the capacity of the network then the rate allocated to each route will multiply by the same amount . similarly , we will say a utility function is access scalable , if multiplying the bandwidth available to each route means that the number flows accepted on each route will multiply by the same amount .",
    "more formally ,            conversely , suppose user scalability and access scalability hold for each @xmath40 and @xmath180 .",
    "taking @xmath181 and @xmath182 , by user scalability and access scalability , respectively , we have that @xmath183 by continuity , there exists an @xmath184 such that @xmath185 also , by , @xmath186 now , ( [ thrm2:2]-[thrm2:4 ] ) imply the following set of equivalences .",
