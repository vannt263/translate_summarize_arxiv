    "a critical architectural issue for quantum computation is the internal communication of quantum information within the processor .",
    "there are a variety of proposed quantum processor implementations with different mechanisms for internal communication .",
    "for instance , the linear ion trap proposal of cirac and zoller @xcite involves physical motion of massive ions for internal communication , as do proposals using more complex ion trap structures @xcite .",
    "alternative proposals involve using photons and cavity qed for communication @xcite .",
    "the cavity qed approach has been extended to the solid state @xcite .",
    "even direct transport of information carrying electrons has been suggested for the solid state @xcite .",
    "our paper is motivated by another class of quantum computation proposals that rely upon local communication through nearest neighbour interactions @xcite .",
    "for instance , communication among electron spins in semiconductors can be performed with sequential swap gate operations , generated by a controlled heisenberg exchange between adjacent electrons .",
    "an appealing feature of the swap operation is that it is generated by the very same two - qubit interaction used for computational operations .",
    "also , a substantial degree of parallelism can be employed",
    ". however , the protection of qubits with concatenated error correction requires communication between a number of physical qubits that grows exponentially with concatenation level .",
    "this exponential increase in swap operations might suggest that concatenated error correction will fail to reduce the logical qubit error rate .",
    "gottesman @xcite , and aharanov and ben - or @xcite have pointed out that a threshold error exists despite an exponential increase in logical gate count with concatenation level @xmath1 , although no attempt was made to quantify what that threshold might be . in this paper",
    ", we estimate that threshold .",
    "the main result we report here is that the number of nearest neighbour communication operations is merely a constant factor over and above the necessary logical operations for error correction at each concatenation level @xmath1 .",
    "our estimated error thresholds are summarized in table [ table : errors ] .",
    "we analyzed in detail fault - tolerant error correction with a concatenated 7-qubit calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) code @xcite on a linear qubit stripe with a width of @xmath0 physical qubits for @xmath1 levels of concatenation , and find an @xmath4 fold reduction in threshold gate operation error due to nearest neighbour communication overhead .",
    "this translates to an @xmath5 fold increase in accuracy of control pulse amplitude and timing in gate operations .",
    "although nearest neighbour communication incurs a significant penalty in the requisite experimental accuracy of qubit gate operations , it is not a fundamental obstacle to fault - tolerant computation in the solid - state .",
    "our analysis is in general agreement with the recent work of svore _",
    "@xcite , who also show that internal communication with local interactions incurs an error threshold penalty , although they do not fully account for all communication steps .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the first section ,",
    "we describe the underlying architecture of a quantum processor composed of electron spin qubits , including a description of the physical layout of electron spin qubits and their grouping into concatenated css logical qubits .",
    "we describe a fault - tolerant error correction protocol in the second section .",
    "our protocol implements error recovery without direct measurement . in the third section",
    ", we calculate the threshold error for gate operations under our error correction protocol , with various assumptions about available resources .",
    "the fourth section considers the relation between control pulse accuracy and gate error thresholds .",
    "given the problem of internal communication in a quantum processor , a higher dimensional architecture is preferred because it would allow qubits to be as close as possible .",
    "however , there must be access by control wires , thus limiting the packing geometry .",
    "[ fig : qubitstripe ] shows a schematic cross - section of a 2-d semiconductor qubit array controlled by gate electrodes accessing qubits from the side .",
    "the number of vertical stacked control electrodes is limited to twice the number of metal wiring layers in the integrated circuit technology .",
    "the need for a reasonable fabrication yield limits the number of metallization layers to @xmath6 , which means that the 2-d array can be at most 20 qubits wide .",
    "[ fig : qubitstripe ] illustrates the case for 5 metallization layers . in this respect , we agree with copsey _",
    "@xcite , who pointed out this restriction specifically in the context of semiconductor qubits .",
    "thus , while the qubit array might be locally 2 dimensional , the overall architecture will consist of 1-d stripes of moderate width , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : serpentine ] .     a schematic representation showing how the number of available metal wire layers limits the width of a 2-d qubit array to only about 10 - 20 qubits . ]",
    "the requirement for gate electrode access to qubits restricts the layout to stripes of either serpentine or intersecting geometry . ]    the lowest level of concatenated qubit encoding , @xmath7 , can be laid out along stripe width , but all higher concatenation levels must be laid out along the stripe length , and are effectively 1 dimensional .",
    "we are thus led to an essentially 1-d concatenation hierarchy , the most challenging for internal quantum communication .",
    "universal sets of fault - tolerant operations are known only for css error correcting codes of various size @xcite . in our work",
    ", we shall consider the @xmath8 $ ] css code .",
    "concatenation @xcite , where each logical qubit is composed of encoded qubits , which are in turn composed of encoded qubits and so on , can suppress logical error rate to arbitrary degree , provided the physical error rates remain below a threshold value .",
    "the self - similarity of concatenation naturally leads to the self - similar logical structure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : linarray ] .",
    "there are 7 level @xmath9 logical qubits forming the css codeword that represents a single level @xmath1 logical qubit @xmath10 .",
    "a minimum of two logical zeros , @xmath11 , and six initially arbitrary ancillae , @xmath12 , are required to perform error correction on @xmath10 .",
    "we consider @xmath0 parallel lines of physical qubits to implement error correction and computation with @xmath1 levels of concatenation .",
    "the error correction protocol is described in detail in the next section .",
    "an important feature of the self - similar hierarchy is that at each concatenation level , the same qubit protection block is employed ( for ancillae as well as information bearing qubits ) .",
    "error correction can thus take place at any logical level within an appropriate logical qubit protection block .",
    "for estimating error thresholds , we consider an aggressive error correction scheme where every unitary operation @xmath13 at concatenation level @xmath1 is followed by error correction @xmath14 at level @xmath1 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuiterror ] .",
    "each unitary operation @xmath13 at logical level @xmath1 is followed by error correction @xmath14 at error correction level @xmath1 . ]",
    "the error correction operation , @xmath14 , can be implemented in a fault - tolerant manner with a steane error correction circuit @xcite , slightly modified to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : el ] .",
    "error correction takes place within an error correction block , with the logical qubit @xmath10 and logical zero states @xmath11 explicitly shown .",
    "the two groups of three @xmath9 ancillae , @xmath12 , are made use of within the bit - flip _ indicator _ circuit , denoted by @xmath15 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : el ] , the steane error correction circuit is particularly parsimonious in its use of gate operations , and leads to particularly favorable error thresholds .",
    "the bit - flip indicator block @xmath15 is essential , where for each logical zero @xmath11 it computes a bit - flip error syndrome into three ancillae qubits @xmath12 .",
    "the syndrome is then decoded within the indicator block @xmath15 into a bit - wise error indicator that can be directly used for error recovery .",
    "note also that only nearest - neighbour operations at logic level @xmath1 are employed , in strict adherence to self - similarity from the physical layer up to concatenation level @xmath1 .",
    "the key point about the bit - flip indicator block @xmath15 is that it operates on logical zeros that have effectively measured the logical qubit error , but not the logical qubit itself , by virtue of a logical cnot gate . as was pointed out by boykin _",
    "@xcite , the identification of which operations require full quantum coherence and which operations do not is important since `` quantum '' operations require full protection against both phase - flip and bit - flip errors , while `` classical '' operations require protection against bit - flip errors only .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ fig : el ] that the outputs of indicator block @xmath15 are used only as control bits for the error recovery operations acting upon the logical qubit .",
    "arbitrary phase flips in the output of @xmath15 have no effect on the logical qubit .",
    "likewise , phase flips on the input of @xmath15 have no effect on the logical qubit since the syndrome is encoded as bit - flips on the input to @xmath15 .",
    "we need only protect against bit - flip errors in @xmath15 , so that the operations within @xmath15 can be thought of as essentially `` classical '' in nature , even though they are executed by physical qubit gates .",
    "thus , @xmath15 can in principle be protected with classical fault tolerance , which has been shown to be much more efficient than quantum fault tolerance @xcite , to ensure that the operations within @xmath15 will contribute negligibly to the quantum error threshold .",
    "of course , the requisite logical zeros , @xmath11 , that allow for efficient fault - tolerant error correction are complex entangled states which must be created with low error probability to begin with .",
    "one approach to this problem is to dedicate adjacent quantum circuitry whose sole function is to prepare and purify logical zeros , providing a steady supply at various concatenation levels specifically for this purpose .",
    "alternatively , the preparation of logical zeros can be performed directly within the qubit error protection block .",
    "the full error correction circuit is illustrated in fig .",

    "a total of 46 qubits would be required , arranged in the following sequence of @xmath9 qubits ( compare with fig .",

    "several levels of concatenation already leads to a large number of physical qubits ( although the width of the qubit stripe grows only as @xmath0 ) .",
    "likewise , the number of physical gate operations grows exponentially , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is approximately the number of logical operations required at level @xmath9 in order to implement a single logical function at level @xmath1 .",
    "for example , with a single level of encoding , @xmath23 is simply the number of physical gate operations required to perform some function on our 7-qubit css code word ( or multiple code words in the case of a multi - qubit logical function ) .    the number of gate operations @xmath23 will depend on the function being performed .",
    "we consider implementing a simple two - qubit unitary , @xmath13 , followed by error correction , @xmath14 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuiterror](b )",
    ". error correction might require @xmath24 logical gate operations at level @xmath9 .",
    "there will be additional logical swap operations at level @xmath9 required to move qubits around since only nearest - neighbour interactions are permitted .",

    "the total _ physical _ gate count is again approximately @xmath30 because each of the @xmath23 operations at @xmath9 is simply a unitary @xmath31 followed by error correction @xmath32 .",
    "the self - similar hierarchy requires that @xmath23 operations at @xmath33 are required for each operation at @xmath9 and so forth , including communication .    in reality ,",
    "the gate count @xmath34 varies among the various logical qubit operations possible .",
    "for instance , hadamard at level @xmath1 requires @xmath35 hadamard gates at level @xmath9 and @xmath36 communication gates .",
    "in contrast , the gate operations @xmath37 involved in a logical swap on the same qubit line are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : swaps ] for adjacent logical qubits .",
    "clearly the number @xmath22 can be very large , although a substantial fraction of operations at each logical level can be performed in parallel .",
    "note the fault tolerance of the logical swap gate : a single swap gate failure induces one error in each logical qubit , which can be recovered independently by error correction .",
    "of course , the extra qubits involved in a qubit protection block increases the number of communication swaps @xmath28 . as a final example",
    ", we show the partial sequence of gate operations required for the logical cnot gate in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnotseq ] .",
    "it is in implementing the cnot gate that an additional line of qubits is used for every concatenation level , resulting in a total of @xmath0 lines of qubits .",

    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     despite the exponential increase in physical qubits and physical gate operations with concatenation level ( while the width of the stripe merely grows linearly in concatenation level ) , logical errors are suppressed double - exponentially with concatenation level .",
    "we let @xmath39 be the logical error probability on a first level encoded state , @xmath40 , after a two qubit unitary followed by a single error correction cycle . by the fault tolerant construction of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the probability of a logical error",
    "is bounded above by the probability that two gate operations fail , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the probability of physical gate error , assumed to be equal for all gates , and @xmath29 as before . while logical error rates shall vary slightly due to differences in @xmath34 amongst the logical gate operations with the dominant @xmath43 remaining fixed ,",
    "a conservative estimate can be had by taking the gate counts for the logical cnot gate as representative .",
    "the criterion for error correction to reduce the likelihood of qubit error is @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to the threshold error condition @xmath45 .",
    "likewise , at higher levels of concatenation , @xmath46 leading to @xmath47 being the error threshold condition for all @xmath1 . the corresponding required phase accuracy for gate operations , as described in section [ sec : gateaccuracy ] , is @xmath48 . from the above relations , we arrive at the standard logical error probability for concatenated error correction , @xmath49 but where @xmath23 now includes the nearest neighbour communication overhead at a particular concatenation level .",
    "the exponent @xmath50 results in an overwhelming , _ super_-exponential in @xmath1 suppression of logical errors while the number of qubits and gate operations increase only exponentially in @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that a quantum computation requires a sequence of @xmath51 logical gate operations , then a logical error probability @xmath52 will give the correct result with only several trials of the computation .",
    "the relation between the number , @xmath51 , of operations in a calculation and concatenation level @xmath1 can be written , @xmath53 or alternatively , @xmath54 for instance , the error threshold might be @xmath55 while the physical gate operation error is an order of magnitude better , @xmath56 .",
    "we then have an accessible computation length @xmath57 , which for @xmath58 gives @xmath59 .",
    "it follows that interesting calculations can be performed with only a few layers of concatenation ( ie . a qubit stripe with a width of only a few qubits )",
    "if physical error probabilities well below the error threshold can be achieved .    the problem of estimating error threshold has been reduced to counting gate operations , for which our numerical results are summarized in table [ table : errors ] .",
    "note that we have neglected storage errors in our present analysis since the coherence times of electron spins in semiconductors @xcite exceed the expected gate operation times by at least @xmath60 orders of magnitude , with further improvement expected .",
    "the top row of table [ table : errors ] gives the most favourable error thresholds where any qubit can interact with any other qubit without any extra communication operations .",
    "the bottom row is the least favourable case where nearest neighbour swap operations are used on a linear qubit array to implement all operations .",
    "the middle row represents an intermediate case , where the remote - cnot is used to perform a cnot gate between distant qubits @xcite . the remote - cnot requires a shared epr pair , a resource that might be generated by independent hardware with sufficient purity that the epr error rate contributes negligibly to the overall error rate of the remote - cnot and the error threshold",
    "measurement and classical communication are also required for the remote - cnot ( see appendix ) .",
    "for all three communication schemes , the gate count is given in table [ table : errors ] for sub - cases where @xmath11 s are supplied by adjacent circuitry ( a parallel qubit stripe , for instance ) ; or where the @xmath11 s are prepared directly within the error correction circuit itself ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullel ] ) thus burdening the error threshold . in the former case ,",
    "we assume that the adjacent circuitry can prepare and purify logical zeros to reach an error probability much less than the preparation circuit of the former case , thereby contributing to the error threshold negligibly .",
    "this might be achieved by successive rounds of purification .    in all cases ,",
    "we assume that those portions of the circuit that can be implemented with classical fault - tolerant logic @xcite , albeit with qubit gates , take advantage of the greater efficiency of classical coding .",
    "the threshold error for classical fault - tolerant circuits has been estimated to be between @xmath61 to @xmath62 depending on topology and communication resources @xcite , we therefore assume the error rates in the classical circuits are negligible compared to the quantum circuits , so that in counting the gate operations we can neglect the operations in @xmath15 and @xmath17",
    ". furthermore , the dual - control phase - flip ( @xmath63 ) and dual - control bit - flip ( @xmath64toffoli ) are assumed to count merely as two - qubit interactions , since fault - tolerant classical logic can be used to generate a single classical control bit .",
    "the remaining sundry details involved in counting gate operations are left to the appendix .    observing the gate error thresholds in table [ table : errors ] , we see that swap communication incurs a penalty of @xmath4x compared to the case of free communication .",
    "communication through the remote - cnot incurs a penalty of @xmath65x compared to the free communication case .",
    "the improvement associated with remote - cnot communication is not as much as one might expect , since the remote - cnot requires multiple operations proportional to the size of the logical qubits .",
    "thus , internal quantum communication reduces gate error thresholds for fault tolerant computation by a substantial factor that we estimate to be from @xmath65x to @xmath4x . while this certainly increases the difficulty in experimentally realizing fault tolerant gate operations , it is by no means an impasse for solid state quantum computation , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "so far , we have worked entirely with error probabilities . in practice ,",
    "experimental gate accuracy is more naturally specified in terms of control pulse amplitude . consider the spin ( or a qubit pseudo - spin ) , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] .",
    "suppose a control pulse , as used in spin resonance , was to bring the spin into alignment with the x - axis .",
    "however , an error in pulse area , phase , or timing may cause a misalignment by some small angle @xmath66 .",
    "the probability of error , @xmath42 , is then the probability that the spin is not projected into the + x direction when a measurement is performed along the x - axis .",
    "the probability of projection along the + x direction is @xmath67 , so that the error probability is , @xmath68 the required gate timing and amplitude accuracy is @xmath69 , specified as a phase angle , is proportional to the _ square root _ of the threshold error probability . the gate accuracy thresholds are given in degrees in table [ table : errors ] . of course , the @xmath65x to @xmath4x penalty in error probability threshold becomes only a @xmath70x to @xmath5x penalty in control pulse accuracy . in order to achieve an error probability of @xmath71 , one would require about 1/30 of a degree accuracy in control pulse timing , which is not entirely infeasible since it would require about 1 picosecond phase accuracy in a clock period of about 10 nanoseconds . recall that an error probability of @xmath71 for a quantum processor with threshold error probability @xmath72 and 3 levels of concatenation will allow a computation with @xmath73 operations .",
    "thus , thinking about gate errors in terms of phase angle makes it clear that very small error probabilities are achievable .     a conceptual illustration of a qubit pseudo - spin that might miss a target x - axis by an angle @xmath66 due to a control pulse error .",
    "the resulting probability of qubit error is @xmath74 . ]",
    "internal quantum communication remains a challenging architectural problem that impacts the threshold error for fault - tolerant computation with encoded logical qubits .",
    "the communication operation overhead required to distribute information among a number of qubits that grows exponentially with concatenation level can be a significant burden . whether one is limited to nearest - neighbour communication , a communication bus ( as in the original cirac - zoller ion trap proposal @xcite ) , or communication by modified teleportation schemes such as the remote - cnot , there is always a communication penalty in error threshold . the minimum communication overhead cost is associated with a communication bus , where a single operation for `` transmitting '' and a single operation for `` receiving '' is possible in principle .",
    "the question of whether a sufficiently robust communication bus is available for solid state qubits remains open .",
    "ballistic transport of electron spins through mesoscopic wires is predicted to give error rates of @xmath75 for gaas @xcite , far above our stated threshold requirements even for the free communication case .",
    "much more promising is the combination of cavity qed techniques with confined electron spins @xcite or superconducting circuits @xcite , where an electromagnetic bus can couple a number of qubits .",
    "the error rates of such a bus , the reconfigurability of its links , and its parallelism ( ie .",
    "how many qubits can be transported simultaneously ?",
    "through the same link ? ) must all be carefully considered in determining what benefits , if any , we can expect over nearest neighbour architectures .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that communication overhead can be mitigated to a large extent by circuit optimization .",
    "recent work @xcite on laying out shor s factorization algorithm on a linear chain of qubits under the restriction of nearest neighbour interaction has shown that circuit optimization can greatly reduce the number of logical qubit swaps required .",
    "we provide a brief summary here of the counting of gate operations , which then leads to the threshold error .",
    "error correction at concatenation level @xmath1 with the circuit @xmath14 requires the use of both single qubit unitaries and two qubit unitaries at levels @xmath1 down to the physical layer .",
    "interestingly , the quantum portions of the circuit @xmath14 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : el ] or [ fig : fullel ] ) consists of gate operations that are directly fault tolerant , where qubit - wise ( or transversal ) operations are sufficient .",
    "these operations include cnot , swap , and h ( hadamard rotation ) .",
    "the control bits of the dual control gates are classical , so a full quantum toffoli is not required .",
    "of course , indirectly fault tolerant gates such as the toffoli ( @xmath76 ) or @xmath77 rotation @xmath78 are required for universal computation .",
    "we do not calculate the error threshold for indirectly fault tolerant gates here .",
