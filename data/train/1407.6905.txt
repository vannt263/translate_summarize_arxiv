    "for this reason , understanding the nature of hgs provides constraints on the grbs progenitors : the collapsar model ( woosley 1993 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) predicts a low metallicity environment , typical of dwarf galaxies , because of the reduced angular momentum loss and mass loss via strong winds at the surface of the star , while in other progenitor models there is no such an assumption ( e.g. ouyed et al .",

    "type ia sne end their lives on timescales ranging from @xmath63 up to an hubble time or more and consequently the snia rate is related to the past star formation history ( sfh ) of a galaxy , whereas the ccsne reflect the birth rate of massive stars , i.e. the galactic star formation rate ( sfr ) . for this reason ,",
    "different types of galaxies have different snrs .",

    "therefore , the estimated value for this parameter is @xmath68 .",

    "we focus on the effects that different star formation histories have on the evolution of the chemical abundances in the ism and how these abundances are affected by dust in galaxies of different morphological type as well as on the different competitive rates involving the dust .",
    "in particular , understanding how the dust rates evolve in time is important in the computation of the global amount of dust and the cosmic rate inferred from our models .",
    "the main assumption concerning the dust rate is on the dust yields describing the fractions of each element followed in our chemical evolution code , which is condensed into dust and restored into the ism by low and intermediate mass stars , type ia and ii sne .",
    "the prescription used to infer the dust production rate are summarized in table [ models - param ] .",

    "[ accrrate ] and [ destrrate ] are shown the rates of accretion and destruction , respectively , in unit of @xmath123 as functions of time for the same models shown in figure [ prodrate ] and with the same color set .",
    "as one can see from figures [ prodrate ] , [ accrrate ] and [ destrrate ] , the rate of dust production in ellipticals is maximum at the beginning of their evolution but also the destruction rate is maximum since they both depend on the sfr , which is assumed to be very high in the first phases of the evolution of these objects ( see fig",
    "the dust accretion rate instead is quite high in spirals when the sfr reaches a maximum , whereas accretion is active in ellipticals only during the starburst and it stops after the occurrence of a wind which devoids the galaxy of gas and dust . on the other hand ,",
    "the rate of destruction of dust in ellipticals continue even after the star formation has stopped , since it depends on sn explosions and type ia sne are active until the present time even in absence of star formation .",
    "these different behaviours are responsible for the shape of the cosmic effective dust production rate that will be described in the next section .      in order to understand the different behaviour of the chemical evolution models developed here , we compare our model results with the abundances measured in the hosts of the three grbs considered .",
    "our main goal was to derive the history of star formation and therefore the nature of the hosts comparing the predictions of [ x / fe ] vs.[fe / h ] for several chemical elements ( c , n , o , mg , s , si , ni and zn ) . among these species , n and zn are not affected by dust while all the others , together with iron , contribute to the total amount of dust .    in figure [ 081008 ]",
    ", we show the results for the host of grb 081008 at @xmath124 studied by delia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in order to assess the importance of dust in this kind of analysis , in figure [ 081008 ] ( only ) , are shown the predictions for @xmath0 -elements , zn and ni relative to fe both in the models with dust ( left column ) and without dust ( right column ) .",
    "it is worth noting that while the ratio [ si / fe ] does not change in the two cases due to the fact that both elements are depleted in dust , for other ratios , such as [ zn / fe ] the situation is different . for example , the curve relative to the irregular galaxy is much lower in the case without dust depletion .",
    "the reason for that resides in the fact that zn is not refractory , whereas fe is .",
    "in particular , in the irregular model the amount of fe in dust is large due to the less efficient dust destruction process relative to the other galaxy types .",
    "this is because the destruction rate depends on the sfr which is quite low in irregulars.therefore , this implies that at any given metallicity the [ zn / fe ] ratio increases relative to the case with no dust depletion .",
    "on the other hand , in the spiral and elliptical models , the [ zn / fe ] is not much altered since they are characterised by a dust destruction rate which is at least comparable to the accretion rate . in the case without dust",
    "the models are allabove the data and this trend suggests that the subtraction of fe by dust is necessary to explain the data .",
    "looking at all the abundance ratios together in figure [ 081008 ] , we can not derive a firm conclusion on the nature of the host of this grb : in fact , while the [ ni / fe ] ratio is inconsistent with all curves , the [ si / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] seem to indicate a spiral galaxy .        in figure [ 120327a ] are shown the predictions and the data for the host of grb 120327a at @xmath125 studied by delia et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . in this case",
    "we show only the models with dust for several elements . concerning n and",
    "zn it is possible to see an inversion in the models : the irregular galaxy model ( c00 ) predicts larger n and zn abundances with respect to the fe than the other two models . to understand the reason of this behaviour , we need to remember that n and zn are not affected by dust while fe is strongly depleted .",
    "indeed , the higher is the star formation efficiency of a galaxy , the higher is the dust grain destruction .",
    "therefore , the model with lower sfe ( green solid line ) predicts higher abundances in these two particular cases .",
    "the trends of [ si , s , zn / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] seem to suggest that the host galaxy is a system with high mass and sfr , namely either a spiral or a proto - spheroid . concerning the [ n / fe ] ratio",
    "it should be said that the n yields are still uncertain and in particular the secondary / primary nature of this element .",
    "in particular , here",
    "n is considered secondary from massive stars , while there are suggestions that n could be produced in a primary fashion in massive stars but only at very low metallicity ( see chiappini et al .",
    "if this is true , it could change the shapes of the models .        finally , in figure [ 120815 ] , we report the results for the host of grb 120815,at @xmath126 observed by kruhler et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ; the elements analyzed here are si , s , ni and zn and all seem to indicate again a massive spheroid with strong sf . in fact , to best fit the abundances in this host we adopted model e01 with sfe=20@xmath127 , which is the maximum value we explored .",
    "it is interesting to note the high value of [ zn / fe ] which means that a higher quantity of dust is present along the line of sight of this grb .    in our analysis , although many uncertainties are still present in the adopted stellar yields and in the observational data and no firm conclusions on the grb hosts can be drawn , two of the three grb host galaxies taken into account seem to favor either a spiral or a spheroidal host , while the third grb ( grb120815 ) seems to be more confidently hosted by a proto - spheroid .",
    "this result , if confirmed in the future by more data , would be in contrast with the claim that most of the hgs are small , star - forming and metal - poor galaxies ( see , e.g. , christensen et al .",
    "2004 , fruchter et al .",
    "2006 and levesque et al .",
    "probably , the apparent discrepancy is due to the galaxy sample used to infer the hgs properties , composed mainly of low redshift objects ( @xmath128 ) . in particular , recent works based on high redshift surveys seem to suggest a more complex view ( e.g. kruhler et al .",
    "2011 ; hunt et al .",
    "2011 ; savaglio et al . 2012 ; elliott et al .",
    "2013 , perley et al .",
    "2013 ) , where the majority of the hgs seem to suffer strong star formation .",
    "this result is not unexpected recalling that grbs are associated with the death of massive and short - lived stars that trace the star formation inside the host .",
    "the explanation lies in the evolution / changing of the star forming tracers as a function of redshift : in the local universe the star formation is mainly traced by small , blue galaxies , while at early epochs it is dominated by massive spheroids and elliptical galaxies .",
    "further evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes from the study of the so called dark grbs .",
    "these grbs are found at high redshift and they have in general a high metallicity .",
    "this is a very interesting fact suggesting that these grbs arise from active star formation in high redshift massive spheroids .",
    "since ellipticals show in general old stars , that means that we are catching ellipticals in formation .",
    "the characteristics behavior of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in spheroids shows a long plateau where they are overabundant relative to fe and the sun .",
    "this is due to the time - delay model which explains the behaviour of abundance ratios on the basis of the production of different elements in different stars with different timescales . in particular",
    ", @xmath0-elements are mainly produced in ccsne restoring them on short timescales , whereas fe is produced mainly in type ia sne and restored on a large range of timescales going from 30 myr to a hubble time ( matteucci 2001 ; 2012 ) .",
    "this implies that , if the sfr is very efficient , the ccsne can produce a substantial amount of fe by themselves and when type ia sne start restoring the bulk of fe the abundance of this element in the ism is already high .",
    "this produces high [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at high metallicity .",
    "the contrary occurs when the sfr is quite low ; the enrichment of fe from core - collapse sne is very modest and when type ia sne start to restore the bulk of fe , the abundance of this element in the ism is still quite low .",
    "this produces low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at low metallicity .",
    "therefore , the diagrams [ x / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] can be in principle very useful tools to infer the nature and the ages of unidentified objects .",
    "in the chemical evolution models , the abundance ratios between two elements formed on different timescales can be used as cosmic clocks@xmath129 and provide us with information on the roles of lims and sne in the enrichment process ( matteucci 2001 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the study of abundance ratios such as [ @xmath0/fe ] is quite useful , since the @xmath0-elements are produced on short timescales by type ii sne , whereas the fe - peak elements and nitrogen are produced on long timescales by type ia sne and low and intermediate - mass stars , respectively ; we use the abundance ratios of elements formed on different timescales to set important constraints on the age and the nature grb hgs .",
    "we define the age of the galaxy @xmath130 as the time passed between the galaxy formation epoch and the grb observation time ; this gives us a quantitative measure of the time required for the galaxy to evolve and reach , at the time of observation of the grb , the chemical abundances observed during the afterglow episode .",
    "practically , it is possible to infer it from the simultaneous comparison between the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs [ fe / h ] and the same ratio as a function of the galactic time , or redshift , in a @xmath131cdm cosmological framework . applying the method to the three grbs analyzed in this paper",
    ", we find an age of 50 myr for the galaxy hosting the grb 120327a , 0.32 gyr for the grb081008 host and 15myr for the grb120815 host .",
    "these young ages indicate that we find grbs to be `` young '' galaxies , namely galaxies in which the star formation is very active , probably suffering their first major star formation episode , but they are not necessary typical of the main population of galaxies that could have started forming stars already much before .",
    "the cosmic rate is defined in an unitary comoving volume of the universe .",
    "this definition is necessary to study the rate at high redshift where the morphology of the observed galaxies is not known .",
    "the cosmic rate refers , in fact , to a mixture of galaxies which can be different at every redshift . in particular , in order to evaluate the amount of dust observed at high redshift , we have to take into account the cosmic dust cycle : dust is produced in stars and it is then blown off in a slow wind or a massive star explosion .",
    "the dust is then recycled in the clouds of gas between stars and some of it is consumed when the next generation of stars begins to form .",
    "we compute the cosmic dust rate in units of @xmath132 by adopting the same method applied to the computation of cosmic star formation rate , as described in the paper of grieco et al .",
    "( 2012a ) . in that paper",
    "the cosmic sfr ( csfr ) has been computed by taking into account the sf histories of galaxies of different morphological type as those shown in fig .",
    "[ sfr ] .",
    "in particular the csfr was defined as : @xmath133 where the sfrs have been then convolved with the number density for each type of galaxy .",
    "the quantity @xmath134 is the galaxy number density , expressed in units of @xmath135 , and @xmath136 identifies a particular galaxy type . in the grieco et al .",
    "( 2012a ) paper , the main assumption was that the galaxy number density is constant in time and equal to the present time one for each galaxy type .",
    "here we define , in the same way , the cosmic dust rate ( cdr ) :    @xmath137 \\cdot n_{k}^ { * } } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath138 is the total production rate of all the elements considered in the dust model ( o , mg , si , s , ca , ni , fe ) , and @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the total accretion and destruction rates , respectively .    in order to study different scenarios for the evolution of galaxy number density , here we assume : @xmath141 as suggested by vincoletto et al .",
    "in particular , we explore two competitive scenarios :    1 .",
    "the _ pure luminosity evolution _ , ple ,",
    "@xmath129 corrisponding to the case proposed in the grieco et al .",
    "( 2012a ) ; the cdr is obtained by assuming that all galaxies started forming stars at the same time and that there is no evolution in the galaxy number density from early epoch to the present time . as a consequence , @xmath142 and @xmath143 for each galaxy type .",
    "2 .   the_density evolution_@xmath129 scenario , de , where the @xmath144 parameter evolves with redshift , as shown in table [ cdrparam ] , where the value of @xmath145 , the same in both cases , and the values of @xmath146 for each galaxy type , are reported .",
    "this particular combination of values is selected in order to obtain a csfr which reproduces the trend of a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario ( e.g. menci et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this picture ,",
    "the majority of ellipticals formed in a large redshift range and by mergers of spirals , with only a small percentage of them forming by means of a strong starburst at high redshift .",
    "clearly the csfrs for the two scenarios are extreme cases , which predict completely different galaxy formation patterns ( see fig . 6 of grieco et al .",
    "2012a , where both cases are shown ) .",
    "because of this , we checked that the integrals of the csfrs in the two cases give a similar stellar density at the present time .",
    "@xmath147 & @xmath148 & @xmath149 +   +   + @xmath150 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 +    in figure [ zcdustr ] , we show the predicted cosmic effective dust production rate as a function of redshift ( black solid line ) , which includes production , accretion and destruction for each galaxy type .",
    "this cosmic effective dust production rate , expressed in @xmath153 , here has been computed by means of eq .",
    "[ cdr ] , under the assumption of no number density evolution of galaxies .",
    "we remind that with no number density evolution we predict a very high star formation rate at high redshift due to the starbursts occurring during the early phases of the proto - spheroid formation ( see grieco et al .",
    "in the same plot are also shown , separately , the cosmic stellar dust production , dust accretion and dust destruction rates as functions of time . fixing the redshift of galaxy formation at @xmath154 , the predicted total cosmic effective dust production rate ( black curve ) shows a a peak at very high redshift followed by a decrease and then another higher peak at @xmath155 .",
    "this behaviour is due to the predominance of proto - spheroids at high redshift where the early high sn production induces first an increase in the dust rate but then a decrease due to the high destruction rate related to the sne themselves .",
    "the peak at @xmath1 is then due to the predominance of the star formation rate in the spirals , because since then , in this scenario , the ellipticals evolve passively .",
    "the cosmic effective dust production rate then decreases strongly for @xmath156 down to redshift @xmath157 and stays constant afterwards until @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting to note that accretion and destruction rates almost compensate each others during the whole cosmic time . in figure [ zcdr_de ]",
    "we show instead the cosmic dust rates as functions of redshift in the case of strong number density evolution .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cosmic effective dust production rate increases slightly from high redshift down to @xmath159 and then decreases down to @xmath158 . in general , the evolution of the effective dust production rate is smoother than in the ple case .",
    "clearly , the two different galaxy evolution scenarios produce different results concerning the cosmic dust evolution .    finally , integrating in time the cosmic effective dust production rate , shown in figures 8 and 9 ,",
    "we can obtain the cumulative cosmic dust mass density in the universe as a function of redshift @xmath160 . in a @xmath131cdm cosmological frame with the critical density being : @xmath161 , for a hubble constant of @xmath162 we can compute @xmath163 and its evolution as a function of redshift , as shown in figure 10 for the two scenarios .",
    "the present time values of @xmath163 from figure 10 are : @xmath164 for the ple scenario , and @xmath165 for the de scenario .",
    "fukugita ( 2011 ) estimated a present time cosmic dust density produced by stars in the universe of @xmath166 , whereas the value estimated from observations is @xmath167 .",
    "other estimates ( loeb & haiman 1997 ; corasaniti 2007 ; inoue & kamaya 2004 ; fukugita 2011 ; menard & fukugita 2012 ) all suggest a value between @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "our values are higher than these estimates and the reason could be that our stellar dust production is probably overestimated , in particular the assumed yield of dust from sneia could be overestimated , since there is no clear observational evidence for dust production in these sne .",
    "however , we checked the effect of suppressing type ia sne as dust producers and the effect on @xmath163 is negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "it is reasonable that the observational estimate of the cosmic dust density is a lower limit . finally , the fact that @xmath163 is larger by a factor of two in the de scenario is probably due to the fact that spiral galaxies dominate , at variance with the ple scenario , where the number of spheroids is comparable to spirals . in the ple scenario ,",
    "the elliptical galaxies evolve very quickly and their star formation is quenched by galactic winds , whereas in the de scenario ellipticals form by mergers of spirals where star formation continues until the present time and the dust production evolves more smoothly .",
    "therefore , in the de case more dust is expected . moreover ,",
    "a slightly higher cosmic density of stars is predicted for the de scenario .",
    "we find : @xmath170 for the ple case and @xmath171 for the de case . in fukugita & peebles ( 2004 )",

    "continuous black line refers to the ple scenario and the dashed red line the de scenario . ]",
    "in this paper , we present a method , based on chemical evolution models , to identify the hosts of grbs .",
    "our idea comes from the following considerations : if grbs are produced by the collapse of massive stars , they are presumably originating in galaxies where the bulk of massive star formation is taking place . from an observational point of view , almost in all the cases where the galaxy hosting the grbs is observed , the burst position suggests that grbs originate in regions where star formation is taking place ( bloom et al 2002 ) . in this context",
    ", the determination of the nature of grb host galaxies and measurements of their star formation rate not only provide evidence in favour of or against the collapsar model , but also provide insight on the nature and origin of star formation in the early universe .",
    "we have presented a comparison between predicted and observed abundances and abundance ratios in some galaxies hosting grbs ( grb081008 , grb120327a and grb120815 ) . to do that we have adopted detailed chemical evolutionary codes for galaxies of different morphological type including dust evolution .",
    "the second aim of this study was to understand the effect of dust on the observed abundance patterns and to make predictions on the cosmic dust content as a function of the cosmic epoch .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * we have studied the evolution of the abundances of c , n , o , mg , si , s , ni and zn in galaxies of different galaxies ( ellipticals , spirals , irregulars ) .",
    "our results suggest that one of the galaxies hosting grb120815 is probably a massive proto - spheroid catched during the active star formation phase , whereas for the other two galaxies hosting grb120327a and grb081008 , no firm conclusion can be drawn , although some of the data seem to suggest spiral or proto - spheroid systems with high mass and star formation rate . in order to derive better conclusions we would need more precise stellar and dust yields . in particular , for some chemical elements the stellar yields are still quite uncertain ( see romano et al .",
    "the result of grb120815 is particularly important since it is the first time that abundances measured in hosts of grbs indicate early type galaxies .",
    "our result , if confirmed by more precise data , suggest that grbs can be hosted in any type of galaxy suffering active star formation .",
    "obviously , local spheroids which do not show any active star formation can not host grbs .",
    "we have also estimated the ages of the grb hosts from chemical evolution and found that they are all young with ages ranging from 15 to 320 myr .",
    "* we have shown that it is very important to include dust in the chemical evolution of galaxies although many uncertainties are still present in the recipes for the formation and destruction of dust . here",
    "we have considered core - collapse sne , agb stars and type ia sne .",
    "we stress that the dust is produced very early in the evolution of galaxies since ccsne have lifetimes from few million to several tenths of million years and the massive agb stars ( 7 - 8 @xmath61 ) have lifetimes of the order of 25 - 40 myr .",
    "valiante et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also showed the importance of taking into account agb stars to explain the dust in high redshift qsos .",
    "another possible source of dust is the condensation of dust grains in quasar winds ( elvis et al .",
    "2002 ) , which has also been supported by observations ( markwick - kemper et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we did not include this source here since pipino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have shown that it contributes negligibly to the total dust production in a massive elliptical , which is the typical qso host .",
    "* we have computed the cosmic effective dust production rate , namely the rate of net dust production in an unitary volume of the universe , by adopting the results of our models and assuming either no number density evolution or strong number density evolution of galaxies , as suggested by the hierarchical clustering scenario for galaxy formation .",
    "they represent two extreme cases . the cosmic star formation rate in these two scenarios ( see grieco et al .",
    "2012a ) is different but the present time cosmic stellar density , which is the integral of the csfr , is roughly the same . to compute the cosmic effective dust production rate , we took into account the rates of production from stars , destruction and accretion of dust in galaxies of different morphological type .",
    "we assumed as a redshift of galaxy formation @xmath154 .",
    "our results show that in the pure luminosity evolution framework there are two peaks , one very close to the galaxy formation redshift and another stronger one at @xmath155 .",
    "then the dust rate decreases down to z=0 . on the other hand , in the number density evolution framework the dust rate increases slightly from the beginning to @xmath159 and then decreases down to z=0 . *",
    "finally , we have estimated the cosmic dust density in the universe at the present time , @xmath173 in both scenarios and the results are : @xmath174 in the case of pure luminosity evolution and @xmath175 in the case of number density evolution of galaxies .",
    "previous estimates ( loeb & haiman 1997 ; corasaniti 2007 ; inoue & kamaya 2004 ; fukugita , 2011 ; menard & fukugita , 2012 ) had suggested @xmath176 .",
    "our values are larger than previous estimates and the reasons for this can be found in an overestimate of the dust production in our galaxy models due either to too large dust yields from stars ( sneii , ia and agb ) or to the poor knowledge of the other processes invoving dust such as destruction and accretion . on the other hand",
    ", we can not exclude that the amount of observed dust is underestimated .",
    "therefore , these particular results should be taken with caution .    to conclude",
    ", it is worth noticing that in our analysis , two of the three grb host galaxies taken into account are well fitted by a massive proto - spheroid model .",
    "this result seems to be in contrast with the claim that most of the hgs are small , star - forming and metal - poor galaxies . probably , the apparent discrepancy is due to the galaxies sample used to infer the hgs properties composed mainly of low redshift objects ( z @xmath177 2 ) .",
    "the explanation for this difference lies in the evolution / change of the star forming galaxies as a function of redshift : in the local universe the star formation is mainly traced by small , blue galaxies while at early epochs it is dominated by massive proto - spheroids .",

    "<S> the nature of some grb host galaxies has been investigated by means of chemical evolution models of galaxies of different morphological type following the evolution of the abundances of h , he , c , n , o , @xmath0-elements , ni , fe , zn , and including also the evolution of dust . by comparing predictions with abundance data , we were able to constrain nature and age of grb hosts . </S>",
    "<S> we also computed a theoretical cosmic dust rate , including stellar dust production , accretion and destruction , under the hypotheses of pure luminosity evolution and strong number density evolution of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that one of the three grb hosts is a massive proto - spheroid catched during its formation , while for the other two the situation is more uncertain , although one could perhaps be a spheroid and the other a spiral galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the chemical ages of the host galaxies which vary from 15 to 320 myr . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the cosmic effective dust production rate in an unitary volume of the universe , our results show that in the case of pure luminosity evolution there is a first peak between redshift z=8 and 9 and another at @xmath1 , whereas in the case of strong number density evolution it increases slightly from z=10 to @xmath2 and then it decreases down to z=0 . finally , we found tha the total cosmic dust mass density at the present time is : @xmath3 in the case of pure luminosity evolution and @xmath4 in the case of number density evolution .    </S>",
