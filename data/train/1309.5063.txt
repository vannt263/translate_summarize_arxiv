    "characterisation of quantum - dynamical systems is a prerequisite for high fidelity quantum computing and information protocols .",

    "avoiding the preparation of many different input states ancilla - assisted quantum process tomography ( aapt )  @xcite was proposed as an alternative . here , the information of all input states is encoded into a single maximally entangled system - ancilla state in a doubled hilbert space .",
    "while both sqpt and aapt rely on state tomography of the output state , direct characterisation of quantum dynamics  @xcite directly addresses features of the underlying dynamics via suitable `` probe '' systems and corresponding measurements . for more details and an investigation of resource demands for each of these strategies",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "if a quantum system is subject to unitary and dissipative dynamics that are completely known , it may still be a non - trivial task to determine the resulting process @xmath2 from a general input state to corresponding output state .",
    "solving that problem is highly relevant in quantum information science , as it quantifies the fidelity of gates for different input states and may eventually point to the optimal application of these gates in algorithms . this article will present a procedure to numerically determine the quantum process @xmath2 from the master equation governing time - dependent system dynamics .",
    "monte - carlo wave - functions  @xcite have allowed a numerically efficient alternative to the ordinary master equation approach to obtain the time dependent density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , a monte - carlo simulation of a quantum system with a hilbert space of size @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) involves far less variables ( @xmath7 ) than its master equation counterpart ( @xmath8 ) . in this paper",
    "we simulate the evolution of our system from an initial maximally entangled state with a non - evolving ancilla system , and we show that the monte - carlo wave - functions for this combined system can be directly processed to yield information about the quantum process @xmath2 .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "v , we show how the time evolved monte carlo wave - functions can be used to yield stochatic `` process vectors '' @xmath9 that directly average to the process matrix @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "vi , we show how the no - jump , single wave function trajectory yields a readily accessible upper bound on the trace distance between the actual process matrix and any desired process matrix - a useful measure of process fidelity . in sec .",

    "in the following discussion we consider a general quantum system with hilbert space dimension @xmath5 . assuming the map @xmath2 is trace preserving then characterisation of @xmath2 is equivalent to a determination of the @xmath23 independent elements of @xmath0  @xcite .",
