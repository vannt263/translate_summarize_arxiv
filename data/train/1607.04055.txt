    "as is well known , gdel begins his  1931 masterpiece with an introductory section , section  1 , wherein he explains the main ideas behind the ( first ) incompleteness theorem in an informal and intuitive way , with an explicit caveat that those remarks are being made `` without any claim to complete precision '' .",
    "what he does in that section is , among other things , to introduce , in a very lucid way , the idea of encoding the syntax and that of diagonalization .",
    "but gdel s introduction is not confined to what can be found , in a more formal expression , in the technical parts of the paper .",
    "gdel s official statement of the first incompleteness theorem ( his theorem  vi ) asserts that for every theory satisfying certain conditions , there is a sentence , now called the gdel sentence of the theory , which is expressible in the language of the theory but is neither provable nor refutable in the theory  the theorem does _ not _ talk about the truth of that undecidable sentence . in his section  1",
    ", however , gdel chooses to also talk about the truth of the gdel sentence of the system of _ principia mathematica _ , and observes that the proof of the first incompleteness theorem , as presented in that section , is similar to richard s paradox .",
    "whatever expository merits it might have , this move is a problematic one , and gdel shows awareness of this .",
    "our purpose in this note is not to philosophize about the notion of truth or doing exegetical work on its rle in gdel s classic paper .",
    "rather , we wish to draw attentions to an informal argument , to the effect that the gdel sentence of the system _ principia mathematica _ is true ( that is , true in @xmath2 ) , which is presented by gdel in his introductory section . we dare to claim that the argument is invalid .",
    "as it goes without saying , this will do no harm to the veracity of gdel s celebrated theorems ; it just shows that the greatest minds can make mistakes , especially when it comes to informal discussions with a `` philosophical '' flavor .",
    "even if we fail to convince our readers that gdel s argument is in fact invalid , we hope at least help them to decipher what the master had in mind when he wrote it .    the argument in question goes as follows @xcite ( italics in the original ) : +    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ from the remark that @xmath3 $ ] says about itself that    it is not provable , it follows at once that @xmath3 $ ] is true ,    for @xmath3 $ ] _ is _ indeed unprovable ( being undecidable ) . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    here @xmath4 $ ] is the * gdel sentence * which is provably equivalent to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the provability predicate of the theory and @xmath7 is the standard term for the gdel number of @xmath8 .",
    "as all such @xmath8s are provably equivalent under certain minimal conditions normally met by the theories under consideration , we are allowed to talk about _ the _ gdel sentence of a given theory .",
    "] of a theory ( or `` system '' ) which is subject to the first incompleteness theorem . from now on",
    ", let us call it @xmath9 .    as we understand the above passage ,",
    "its logical form is the following , where @xmath0 is an arbitrary sentence expressible in the language of the theory :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 says about itself that it has a property @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 indeed has the property @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   therefore : @xmath0 is true .",
    "that gdel says that it follows _ at once _ that @xmath9 is true suggests that , in gdel s view , we are not dealing with an enthymeme ",
    "it seems to us that , for gdel , the argument scheme has no missing premises .",
    "it is our task in the next section to argue that the ( 1)(3 ) argument scheme is * invalid * , that is to say , there are situations wherein the premises are true while the conclusion false .",
    "any invalid argument could be rendered valid by the addition of some premises .",
    "so , in order to strengthen our case , and in order to be maximally fair to gdel , we shall understand the above argument augmented with other premises .",
    "most importantly , the context of gdel s introduction almost forces us to presume that the system is consistent .",
    "is actually false ( in the standard model ) , but demonstrating this fact is not as easy as it might appear . recall that the usual way of arguing for the truth of @xmath9 is to use the fact that @xmath9 was constructed , via the diagonal lemma , in a way that the system proves @xmath10 . however , under the assumption of inconsistency , this equivalence is totally useless in determining the truth - value of @xmath9 ( in @xmath2 , or anywhere ) , for the system proves any other thing as well , e.g. , @xmath11 .",
    "one has to look at the details of the construction of @xmath9 in order to determine the truth - value ( in @xmath2 ) of the gdel sentence of an inconsistent theory . ] with an eye to his formulation of the first incompleteness theorem , one might also feel an obligation to presume something even stronger than simple consistency : we assume that the system is @xmath12-consistent .    in the next section we proceed to support our claim about the invalidity of the ( 1)(3 ) argument .",
    "we assume that we are working with an @xmath12-consistent recursively axiomatizable extension of robinson s @xmath13 .",
    "( the system _ pm _ of gdel s title is of course axiomatizable ; hopefully it is @xmath12-consistent as well . ) naturally enough , the validity of the argument hinges on its terms , in particular on what it is for a sentence to be `` true '' , and what is meant by a sentence `` saying of itself '' that it has a certain property . as for the first term , it is almost obvious from gdel s introductory section that , like many modern writers in mathematical logic , when he writes `` true '' simpliciter , he means _",
    "true in the standard model _",
    ", @xmath2 .",
    "( addition ) and @xmath14  ( multiplication ) , both for natural numbers , and in which the quantifiers @xmath15 , too , apply to natural numbers only . '' ] regarding the notion of saying something of oneself , we shall consider two interpretations that might be ascribed to gdel .",
    "how are we to understand the expression `` @xmath0 says that it has the property @xmath1 '' ? modulo an agreement over the meaning of `` holding '' , to which we shall return shortly , we think it is uncontroversial that if the conditional @xmath16 holds , then @xmath0 says , _ inter alia _ , that it has property @xmath1 . thus to say that @xmath0 says ,",
    "_ exactly _ , that it has property @xmath1 is to say that the biconditional @xmath17 holds . and",
    "this is , in fact , what is taken to be the meaning of `` @xmath0 says of @xmath0 that it has property @xmath1 '' in the literature ; see , e.g. , @xcite . as for the meaning of `` holding ''",
    ", we already presented evidence for the claim that what gdel meant by it is being true in the standard model , @xmath2 .",
    "however , let us recognize another reading of it  which is also suggested in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein)namely _ being provable in a given theory_. having fixed a theory ( which we suppose to be an @xmath12-consistent recursively axiomatizable extension of @xmath13 ) , we then have eight possible ways of interpreting the ( 1)(3 ) argument scheme .",
    "here is the complete list , of which we find ( vii ) , ( v ) , and ( iii ) the most interesting :    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    of these , ( i ) and ( viii ) are of course valid because of the truth - condition of the material conditional and modus ponens , respectively . for all other cases , we will present triples @xmath22 which invalidate them .    recall that `` @xmath13 '' denotes robinson s arithmetic , and",
    "`` @xmath23 '' denotes its gdel sentence , i.e. , we have @xmath24 and also @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the provability predicate of @xmath13 . is sound .",
    "for example , by the construction of @xmath23 one can rather easily show ( i )  @xmath25 , and with a longer ( and more delicate ) proof one can also derive ( ii )  @xmath24 ; so we do not infer ( i ) from ( ii ) _ and the soundness of @xmath13_. ]    the argument ( iv ) is invalid for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "obviously , @xmath30 .",
    "also , because of the expressive power of @xmath13 , we have @xmath31 . by gdel s",
    "proof @xmath32 holds and so @xmath33 . on the other hand , by gdel s",
    "theorem , @xmath34 .",
    "the following show that ( ii ) and ( vi ) are invalid : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we already have @xmath25 .",
    "since by gdel s theorem we have @xmath34 , it follows that @xmath38 is true , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be a formula of the language of arithmetic which expresses the following : _ if the formula with gdel number @xmath41 is appended to @xmath13 , the resulting theory is @xmath12-consistent _ ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 19 ) for the details ) .",
    "let @xmath42 be the fixed - point of @xmath43 obtained by the diagonal lemma  that is to say , let @xmath42 be such that @xmath44 and also @xmath45 . as shown by isaacson ( ibid .",
    ", with a proof attributed to kreisel in the 1950s ) , the @xmath46-sentence @xmath42 is false ( in @xmath2 ) and the theory @xmath47 is @xmath12-consistent .    the argument ( v ) does not hold for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "by @xmath51 we have @xmath52 .",
    "now , @xmath53 holds trivially . by (",
    "* propositions  19 ) , @xmath54 .",
    "neither ( iii ) nor ( vii ) hold for @xmath48 , @xmath55 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we already have @xmath44 and @xmath45 by definition , and so @xmath56 holds too .",
    "the latter also implies that @xmath57 . finally , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* propositions  19 ) we have @xmath54 .    out of fairness to gdel ,",
    "let us acknowledge the fact that perhaps it is only by overgeneralizing his informal argument that we are making the argument invalid .",
    "had we not abstracted from the specific properties of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath58 , gdel s informal argument would be valid , even in the interesting cases of ( iii ) , ( v ) , and ( vii ) ( though it would lose much of its appeal ) .",
    "this is substantiated in the following :    [ prop ] if @xmath59 and the @xmath12-consistent theory @xmath58 is @xmath60-complete , then the arguments ( iii ) , ( v ) , and ( vii ) are valid .",
    "let @xmath61 for some @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "so , @xmath66 , thus @xmath67 .",
    "now we reach a contradiction in each case :    * from @xmath68 and @xmath69 we have @xmath70 , which contradicts the assumption @xmath71 .",
    "* from @xmath67 we have @xmath70 and then , since @xmath72 and @xmath58 is @xmath12-consistent , we should have @xmath68 ; contradiction . * similar to the case of ( v ) , we have @xmath70 , contradicting @xmath71 in the assumptions .",
    "@xmath73    let us note that if @xmath58 is a sound theory then ( iii ) , ( v ) , and ( vii ) are of course valid ; proposition  [ prop ] shows that we can replace the condition of soundness of @xmath58 with its @xmath12-consistency and @xmath60-completeness .",
    "where does this leave us ? it is a fact that , in the final paragraph of his introductory section , gdel gives an argument , which we quoted in full .",
    "is that argument valid ?",
    "we took ( 1)(3 ) to be the form of the argument , and we envisaged eight ways to understand it , of which we showed six to be invalid .",
    "of the two valid arguments , we find ( i ) to be rather insipid and not in accord with the flavor of gdel s overly syntactic approach in the technical part of his paper",
    ". however , we are not going to argue for this here .",
    "if gdel s intended reading of the argument was ( i ) , let it be .    as for ( viii ) , which is the only other valid one , it is an objective fact that no ideally intelligent logician could take it to be what the ( 1)(3 ) argument means .",
    "this is because , we recall , gdel s property @xmath1 is that of unprovability in the system and he says that @xmath9 does have the property @xmath1 . now",
    "if we think that by ( 2 ) he meant that @xmath74 is provable in @xmath58 , we should attribute the idea to gdel that the system proves @xmath75 .",
    "but it is an easy consequence of lb s theorem that no consistent theory proves the unprovability of _ anything_. proves @xmath76 , then @xmath58 proves @xmath77 as well .",
    "hence , by lb s theorem , @xmath58 proves @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that @xmath58 proves @xmath79 which , together with our starting assumption , makes @xmath58 inconsistent . ] so that , at least with the wisdom of hindsight , gdel had better not thought of `` @xmath9 is indeed unprovable '' to mean that the system proves the unprovability of @xmath9 ( though it is not clear to us if gdel was aware of lb s result ) .",
    "this observation rules out the reading ( viii ) ( and of course those of ( iii ) , ( iv ) , and ( vii ) as well ) .",
    "perhaps we should be content that we have made it clear what gdel meant by the argument .",
    "as we noted after proposition  [ prop ] , the interesting cases of ( iii ) , ( v ) , and ( vii ) turn out to be valid if @xmath58 is sound .",
    "the assumption of soundness may appear to be what gdel had in mind , for , in the very first paragraph of his paper , he says that his result holds in particular for every extension of _ pm _ and _ zf _ , `` provided no false proposition of the kind specified in footnote 4 become provable owing to the added axioms '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  f ) . in itself",
    ", this strongly suggests that he is talking about * sound * theories , i.e. , theories @xmath58 with @xmath80 . also , in the final paragraph of his section  1 he says ",
    "and we have quoted this in our footnote  1that his method of proof is applicable to any formal system which is , first , of sufficient expressive power and , secondly , is such that `` every provable formula is true in the interpretation considered '' .",
    "this , too , may suggest ( though not as forcibly as the previous quote ) that gdel is talking about _ sound _ theories .",
    "however , soundness can not be what he had in mind as a required property for theories under consideration , for he immediately adds that the purpose of the technical part of the paper is , among other things , to replace this second condition by a purely formal _ and much weaker _ one ( see our footnote  1 again ) .",
    "it is quite obvious that by the `` much weaker '' assumption he means @xmath12-consistency , a condition he introduces just before his theorem  vi ( on page  173 ) . which brings us to our next remark .",
    "we had already noted ( proposition  [ prop ] ) that with certain extra premises concerning the complexity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the @xmath12-consistency and @xmath60-completeness of the system , what we find the most interesting readings of gdel s ( 1)(3 ) argument are in fact valid . yet",
    ", we find this a matter of reading too much into gdel s argument in that introductory section  recall that he says that the conclusion follows _ at once_. at any rate , we consider it an open possibility that gdel really meant to talk about @xmath81-formulas and @xmath81-properties and @xmath12-consistent , @xmath60-complete theories . if that is what he meant , let it be .",
    "perhaps more importantly , we are aware that there is an ongoing discussion on what it means for a formula to say something of itself ( in this regard , the paper of @xcite is an invaluable source ) . by no means",
    "do we want to neglect the debate .",
    "however , if the task is to _ evaluate gdel s argument as presented in his introductory section _ , we take it obvious that he had thought of the very sentence @xmath9 ( or @xmath3 $ ] is his own notation ) as a sentence saying of itself that it was unprovable .",
    "so , whatever the correct analysis of the concept of self - attribution might turn out to be , _ what gdel had in mind",
    "_ must have been something retrievable from what he has done in his 1931 paper . given that his apparatus for constructing @xmath9 is the diagonal lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the formula @xmath82 on page  175 in the proof of theorem  vi ) , we think there is no choice but to think that , for gdel , saying that _ @xmath0 says of itself that it has property @xmath1 _ means either that @xmath83 is provable in the system , or else this biconditional is true in @xmath2 .",
    "we therefore find ( i)(viii ) as the only readings of the ( 1)(3 ) argument that gdel could have had in mind .",
