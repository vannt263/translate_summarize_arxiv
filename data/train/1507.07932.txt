    "the right panel shows the effect of agn contamination on the line ratios in the stacked data . the hard ionizing radiation field from an agn strongly affects the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio because more @xmath40 ions are ionized into @xmath41 ions .",

    "the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio ratio rises by @xmath45  dex across the @xmath0 redshift range for all stellar masses in the range @xmath46 .",

    "we will now briefly investigate possible mechanisms which could produce this observed rise in the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio .",
    "larger pressures in the  regions of galaxies may cause a rise in the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio .",
    "this pressure can be inferred from the electron density of the gas . in a fully ionized plasma with an isobaric density distribution , the particle density is defined in terms of the ratio of the mean ism pressure , and mean electron temperature , @xmath48 , through @xmath49 , and @xmath36 is related to the electron density through @xmath50 .",
    "for an ionized gas , the electron temperature is @xmath51  k and the electron density is therefore proportional to the ism pressure ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "we can trace the electron density in the shels sample for @xmath52 using the [ ]  @xmath53 [ ]  @xmath54 ratio .",
    "we find that the difference in [ ]  ratio between @xmath3 is consistent with no change with redshift ; @xmath55 [ ]  @xmath53 [ ]  @xmath54@xmath56 from @xmath8 to @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , a larger ism pressure increases all three [ ] , [ ] , and [ ]  ratios simultaneously because the larger pressure suppresses ir fine structure cooling , leading to more collisional excitations of all three [ ] , [ ] , and [ ]  lines ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in the shels sample between @xmath3 , the log([]/h@xmath2 ) and log([]/h@xmath2 ) ratios actually decrease with redshift by @xmath58  dex ( panels c and g of figure  [ agn_removal ] ) .",
    "we therefore rule out increasing pressure with redshift as the cause of the observed change in shels line ratios across the @xmath3 range .",
    "recently , a hard ionizing radiation field has been proposed as the cause of the large [ ] /h@xmath1  line ratios in high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the effect of a hard ionizing radiation field on the optical line ratios is clearly illustrated in figure  [ agn_removal ] by comparing the panels with and without an agn for high mass galaxies ( @xmath59@xmath60 ) .",
    "a hard ionizing radiation field from either an agn , shocks , or from a hot stellar population ( such as wolf - rayet stars ) ionizes more neutral nitrogen and sulphur into @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as well as ionizing @xmath40 into @xmath41 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the [ ]  emission - line is particularly sensitive to the hardness of the ionizing radiation field . in a hard ionizing radiation field ,",
    "a large , warm and partially ionized zone containing @xmath62 ion extends to the edge of the photoionised nebula , producing enhanced [ ] /h@xmath2  ratios . because both [ ] /h@xmath2  and [ ] /h@xmath2  ratios fall with redshift , we can rule out a hard ionizing radiation as the cause of the change in shels line ratios with redshift .",
    "a larger ionization parameter might produce the observed change in line ratios . in figure  [ oiiioii_z ] , we show that the ionization - parameter sensitive line ratio [ ] / [ ]  rises with redshift ( by up to @xmath63  dex ) .",
    "this change in [ ] / [ ]  ratio corresponds to a change in the ionization parameter of up to @xmath64  @xmath65 .",
    "although an increase in pressure can lead to an apparent rise in @xmath33 of this magnitude @xcite , the pressures needed would be in excess of @xmath66 , which is excluded by an absence of any change in the electron density as measured by the [ ]  @xmath53 [ ]  @xmath54 ratio with redshift in the shels sample .",
    "thus , any change in the hydrogen ionizing photon flux must be produced either by increasing the hardness ( i.e. changing the slope ) of the ionizing euv radiation field , or by scaling up the whole ionizing radiation field by a some factor .",
    "we have already ruled out a change in the hardness of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "we now investigate the prospect of scaling the radiation field .    a larger hydrogen ionizing photon flux on the inner edge of the nebula could either be produced by collective effects such as a larger number of stars within an individual  region , or by geometrical effects such as a generally closer proximity of the stars to the ionisation front  as in blister  regions .",
    "if the first hypothesis is correct , we would expect the ionization parameter to be related to the current star formation rate .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested by comparing the [ ] / [ ]  ratio or the derived ionization parameter with the h@xmath1  emission - line equivalent width , because the balmer equivalent width traces the relative fraction of young stars to old stars in a galaxy ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "indeed , we find a strong correlation ( figure  [ logq_ewhb ] ) between these quantities . the spearman - rank correlation coefficient between the ionization parameter and the h@xmath1  equivalent width is 0.81 , and the probability of obtaining this value by chance is formally zero ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we conclude that a larger number of young to old stars within  regions is likely to be principally responsible for the change in ionization parameter with redshift in the shels sample .",
    "if the ionization parameter increases with redshift , then this will have important implications on the use of line ratios to derive metallicity at high redshift .",
    "in particular , the [ ] /h@xmath2  ratio and the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratios will be impacted strongly by a change in ionization parameter .",
    "both of these line ratios are in widespread use in high - z metallicity studies due to their insensitivity to extinction and flux calibration .",
    "if the ionization parameter is not taken into account , the [ ] /h@xmath2  ratio will underestimate the metallicity .",
    "the effect of ionization parameter on the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio is more complicated because the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio is double - valued with metallicity . at high metallicity ( @xmath68@xmath69 ) ,",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath1  metallicity will be underestimated , while at low metallicity ( @xmath68@xmath70 ) , the [ ] /h@xmath1  metallicity will be overestimated .",
    "we recommend that the ionization parameter and metallicity be derived simultaneously to ensure reliable metallicity estimates for non - local galaxies .",
    "we investigate the change in optical line ratios across @xmath0 for the shels survey . for @xmath5 , the [ ] /h@xmath1  and [ ] / [ ]  ratios rise ( by @xmath71  dex ) across the full @xmath0 range .",
    "for @xmath3 we show that while the [ ] /h@xmath1  and [ ] / [ ]  ratios rise , the [ ] /h@xmath2  and [ ] /h@xmath2  ratios fall significantly ( by @xmath72  dex ) for stellar masses betweeon @xmath4 .",
    "we explore these changes in terms of the electron density ( or ism pressure ) of the gas , the slope of the ionizing radiation field , and the relative fraction of young to old stars .",
    "we rule out a change in the electron density and a change in the hardness of the ionizing radiation field as dominant causes of our observed change in line ratios with redshift .",
    "we examine the effect of agn contamination .",
    "we show that agn substantially contaminates the [ ] /h@xmath1  line ratios at stellar masses ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "agn removal is critical for high - z studies that interpret the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio in terms of star - forming galaxy properties .",
    "however , contribution by agn does not affect the general trends observed in the shels [ ] /h@xmath2  and [ ] /h@xmath2  line ratios .",
    "it is unclear whether this lack of agn sensitivity will hold at high - z , given potentially different ism conditions and agn properties .",
    "we show that the observed change in shels line ratios across @xmath3 is dominated by a rise in the ionization parameter with redshift .",
    "the geometry , stellar mass contained , and the age of the stellar populations within  regions may all contribute to the observed ionization parameter .",
    "the observed change in ionization parameter is strongly correlated with the fraction of young to old stars , as traced by the h@xmath1  equivalent width .",
    "we emphasize that while the ionization parameter dominates the change in line ratios observed in shels , the ionization parameter may not be the dominant cause of a change in line ratios for different redshift ranges or different stellar mass ranges , particularly where shocks or agn contamination may be present .",
