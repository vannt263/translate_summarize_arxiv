    "in the last decade , fluorescence imaging has emerged as one of the key imaging modalities in medicine and biology .",
    "the importance of fluorescence techniques have reached a new level with the advent of super - resolution microscopy .",
    "briefly , super - resolution refers to imaging specimens with a resolution better than the classical resolution limit .",
    "this limit is popularly known as abbe s diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "some of the prominent techniques that are capable of super - resolution are , plam @xcite , fpalm @xcite , storm @xcite , gsdim @xcite , sted @xcite , 4pi @xcite and si @xcite .",
    "of - late the field of super - resolution has expanded with the integration of super - resolution with light - sheet microscopy @xcite@xcite .",
    "most of these techniques are capable of spatial super - resolution , some at the expense of poor temporal resolution . specifically , this is true for localization techniques ( palm , fpalm , storm , gsdim ) . on the other hand ,",
    "fluorescence imaging techniques that are capable of high temporal resolution are , multiphoton multifocal microscopy ( mmm ) , multifocal plane microscopy , multiple excitation spot optical ( meso ) microscopy and multiple light - sheet microscopy ( mlsm ) . in the next few sections",
    ", we will elaborate on these technique and its working principle . in section",
    "ii , we derive a simple expression for the temporal resolution of fluorescence imaging system . section iii deals with the description of imaging systems that are capable of high temporal resolution .",
    "we conclude the article in section iv .",
    "the most logical way to quantify the temporal resolution can be derived by determining the time required for completing a single excitation - emission cycle of the excited fluorophore .",
    "this is based on the fact that , the temporal resolution is ultimately limited by the recycle time of the fluorescent molecule between ground and excited state , provided there is no photobleaching .",
    "consider a simplistic three level system for the fluorophore ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the following sub - processes occur in a three - level system : excitation ( @xmath4 ) , internal conversion ( @xmath5 ) and emission ( @xmath6 ) that occurs in the timescales , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . to simplify the process and to get an approximate estimate of the temporal resolution",
    ", one can neglect the time required for excitation and internal conversion as compared to emission process .",
    "so , the dominant sub - process that consumes maximum time in an excitation - emission cycle is essentially emission time , and hence the temporal resolution is limited by the time required for all the excited molecules to return to the ground state ( @xmath10 ) from the excited state @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , the temporal resolution is decided by the ensemble of molecules that gets excited at the focal volume .",
    "let us consider that the local density of fluorescent molecules at the focal volume be @xmath12 and the focal volume be @xmath13 .",
    "so , the total number of excited molecules in the focal volume is simply , @xmath14 . during excitation process ,",
    "the molecules that gets excited to @xmath15 are , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the absorption cross - section .",
    "so , the temporal resolution is determined by the the fraction of molecules in the excited state .",
    "the limit of temporal resolution is essentially the time required for all the excited molecules ( i.e , @xmath18 ) to return to the ground state .",
    "this further assumes the ideal condition that , all the emitted photons are detected .",
    "one can take into account many other factors including the detector efficiency for better approximation of temporal resolution limit .",
    "+ in a simplistic three - level system ( @xmath19 ) , we assume that , molecules are in excited state @xmath15 .",
    "there are two major processes that result in deexcitation i.e , fluorescence ( with , emission rate , @xmath20 ) and non - radiative relaxation ( with a rate , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the governing equation for determining the excited and triplet state population are given by , @xmath22 with the additional constraint that , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the photon flux of the excitation laser .",
    "@xmath25 is total emission rate ( including both radiative and non - radiative rate ) .",
    "+ since , we are interested in the time required by the molecule to return to the ground state from the excited state , we can start with the initial condition that , the molecules are in excited state @xmath15 .",
    "note that , the time required for excitation is orders of magnitude smaller than the emission timescale .",
    "accordingly , one can drop the first term ( @xmath26 ) on the right - hand side of first rate equation .",
    "the resultant rate equation for the excited state population @xmath27 becomes , @xmath28 where @xmath25 is total emission rate ( including both radiative and non - radiative rate ) .",
    "+ integration and simplification gives , @xmath29",
    "@xmath30    now , we divide both the sides by @xmath31 to convert the solution in @xmath32-scale , @xmath33 @xmath34 where , @xmath35 .",
    "+ imposing the boundary condition that , @xmath36 at @xmath37 , we get , @xmath38 .",
    "substituting this in ( 3 ) gives , @xmath39    @xmath40    where , @xmath41 .",
    "+ since , the output fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of molecules in the excited state , so one can rewrite the above equation in terms of output fluorescence , @xmath42 where , @xmath43 corresponds to the intensity due to @xmath16 number of molecules in the excitation volume .",
    "it may be noted that , the above derivation is similar to the derivation for determining lifetime of fluorescent molecules .",
    "+ now , we investigate eqn.(5 ) for few special cases : + * case .",
    "i * : for @xmath44 , we get , @xmath45 and hence the corresponding intensity in ideal condition is , @xmath46 .",
    "this indicates the fact that , @xmath47 fraction of molecules ( i.e , @xmath48 of total excited molecules ) in the focal volume emit before @xmath44 and @xmath49 emit after @xmath44 . + * case . ii * : for @xmath50 , @xmath51 giving , @xmath52 .",
    "this indicates that , @xmath0 of total excited molecules emit before @xmath50 and so only @xmath53 emit after @xmath54 .",
    "+ it is to be noted that , the limit on temporal resolution is determined by the time required for nearly cent - percent ( i.e , @xmath0 ) molecules to relax to the ground state . as an example , for near cent - percent i.e , @xmath0 emission , the molecules require at least @xmath55 time for completing the cycle ( @xmath56 ) , assuming all the emitted photons are detected .",
    "@xmath57 is the minimum time that the ensemble of molecules requires to prepare itself for the next excitation - emission cycle .",
    "this can be considered as the temporal resolution limit and any detector / device that works faster than this time ( @xmath58 ) would not be able to do better .",
    "this restriction is solely due to the molecular excitation - emission cycle of the ensemble of molecules in the focal spot .",
    "it may ne noted that , the derivation is simple and similar to the derivation for determining the lifetime of fluorescent molecules .",
    "a much more sophisticated estimate can be obtained by considering other factors such as , photobleaching and scattering .",
    "in this section , i will discuss about imaging techniques that are capable of high temporal resolution .",
    "some of the key techniques are : multifocal multiphoton microscopy @xcite , multifocal plane microscopy @xcite , multiplane microscopy @xcite , multiple excitation spot microscopy @xcite and multiple light - sheet microscopy @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on some of these techniques .",
    "multifocal multiphoton microscopy is probably the first fluorescence imaging technique that brings in the concept of high temporal resolution .",
    "multiphoton excitation takes place in the focal region where the high photon flux makes possible the simultaneous interaction of two photons with the target molecules . with the availability of powerful lasers ( ti - saffire laser ) of average power of @xmath59 and peak power in few hundred gigawatts ,",
    "it becomes attractive to think of ways to accelerate the imaging process by splitting the beam so as to generate several focal spots .",
    "this facilitates large area parallel scanning of the specimen .",
    "+ in ideal situation , the signal from the focus of a 2-photon excitation ( 2pe ) microscopy system is directly proportional to the @xmath60-order of average laser power @xmath61 , and inversely proportional to pulse width ( @xmath62 ) and repetition rate ( @xmath63 ) i.e , @xmath64 where , @xmath65 is the n - photon cross - section . + in case of mmm system , the laser beam is split into m - beams so the average power gets scaled by @xmath66 i.e , the power for each beam in mmm system is , @xmath67 .",
    "so the output signal emerging from the focus for the overall mmm system of m - beams is given by , @xmath68 where , @xmath65 is the 2-photon absorption cross - section .",
    "+        a typical realization of mmm - system is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 . there are two parts : first , the microlens array and second , the high resolution inverted fluorescence microscope .",
    "the laser beam is appropriately expanded using a beam - expander ( be ) to fill the microlens array .",
    "this results in the generation of many tiny focal spots which are directed to the dichoric mirror ( dm ) using a 4f lens system .",
    "the rays are subsequently reach the back - aperture of the objective lens through relay lens ( rl ) . for simplicity ,",
    "ray diagram for only one of the lens is shown in fig.1 .",
    "similarly , an array of discrete focus points are created in the focal plane by other micro - lenses .",
    "subsequently , the fluorescence from each of the points are collected by the same objective lens ( o ) and focused to the detector ( d ) . the dichroic mirror filters out the incident light and allows the stoke - shifted fluorescence light to pass - through .",
    "this system results in imaging many points on the plane in a single go and the disk can be rotated ( see fig.1 ) to collect data from other planes . in this way",
    "fast data - collection can be achieved . as an example , xy - images of live boar - sperm cells are obtained within 30 ms using mmm system has been demonstrated @xcite . the head and tail of the cells",
    "are respectively labeled with hoechst 33342 and fluorescein .",
    "a stack of 191 images were reportadely obtained within 6s that help in monitoring of the movements of the cells in the aqueous medium @xcite . a recent version of mmm system indicate a frame rate of @xmath69 .",
    "using this system , contraction of cardiac myocytes ( labeled with fluo3 dye ) were obtained at an incredible fast rate of 640 hz @xcite .",
    "+ noted that , there are many more realizations of mmm system @xcite .",
    "moreover , advanced variants of mmm system include , fluorescence lifetime imaging and second harmonic generation that are capable of generation multi - focal lifetime and second - harmonic images much faster than the classical techniques . while mmm system has many advantages they have limitations too .",
    "the most prominent one is the crosstalk arising from the overlap of the fields from multiple foci .",
    "another limitation is the inability to obtain reliable image of scattering specimen .",
    "+      multiple excitation spot optical microscopy ( meso ) is an imaging technique that enables simultaneous visualization of multiple specimen planes . unlike other techniques ,",
    "this has the inbuilt potential for enabling multi - particle tracking .",
    "this feature makes it a unique tool for simultaneous monitoring and tracking many particles for understanding complex biological processes .",
    "this technique was first proposed by us @xcite@xcite .",
    "+ the schematic diagram describing a meso imaging system is shown in fig.8 .",
    "the illumination consists of objective lens @xmath70 and @xmath71 arranged in a @xmath72-geometry .",
    "spatial filtering technique is employed in which both the objective lens are aperture engineered .",
    "spatial filter is purposefully designed to produce an annular / ring illumination at the back of the objective lens . since",
    ", the objective lens approximately perform fourier transform , this give rise to bessel - like beam when illuminated with a ring - illumination pattern .",
    "a similar counter - propagating phased - matched bessel - like beam is generated by the aperture - engineered objective @xmath71 .",
    "the super - position of both the beams at the focus give rise to interference pattern producing an array of nanodot pattern .",
    "orthogonal detection is employed to detect fluorescence from individual nanodots .",
    "this is achieved by placing a detection objective @xmath73 at @xmath74 to the illumination arm ( see , fig.8 ) .",
    "the detection object is moved along the optical z - axis to collect fluorescence from individual nanodots .",

    "+ the technique employs a theta detection scheme , in which the detection is carried out in the orthogonal plane , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the orthogonal plane is represented by the following transformation : ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this detection scheme has the advantage of high resolution at long working distance .",
    "the isotropic emission model is assumed with randomly polarized light excitation .",
    "the components of the detection psf are , @xmath92    where the integration @xmath93 on the aperture - free objective ( @xmath73 ) is carried over the detection semi - aperture angle @xmath94 .",
    "+ overall , the system psf of the proposed imaging system is given by , @xmath95    the illumination , detection and system psf for the proposed @xmath96 system are shown in fig.9 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "one can immediately note that , the axial resolution of the proposed system is improved by a factor of approximately @xmath99 over the classical resolution limit , while there is no improvement in the lateral resolution because the perpendicular detection occurs along the lateral axis of the illumination objective .",
    "study show that , the axial and lateral resolutions are approximately , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively @xcite . in principle , the fluorescence from all of the nanodots can be recorded by scanning the objective @xmath73 . in principle , simultaneous detection from all nanodots can be obtained by using appropriate optical elements , such as , a distorted diffraction grating in the detection path of the imaging system @xcite .",
    "such a system has the capability for near - simultaneous in - depth multilayer imaging of biological specimens , thereby increasing the temporal resolution of the imaging system .",
