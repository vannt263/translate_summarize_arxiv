    "within the indirect search for new physics ( np ) there is a an ambiguity of the new physics scale . in the model - independent approach using the effective electroweak hamiltonean , the contribution to one specific operator @xmath0 can be parametrized via @xmath1 where the first term represents the sm contribution at the electroweak scale @xmath2 and the second one the np contribution with an unknown coupling @xmath3 and an unknown np scale @xmath4 .",
    "the radiative and semi - leptonic penguin modes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes and , thus , are highly sensitive for new degrees of freedom via virtual effects ( for reviews , see @xcite ) the non - existence of large np effects in flavour observables in general   @xcite implies the famous flavour problem , namely why fcnc are suppressed .",
    "either the mass scale of the new degrees of freedom , @xmath4 , is very high or the new flavour - violating couplings , @xmath7 , are small for ( symmetry ? ) reasons that remain to be found .",
    "for example , assuming _ generic _ new flavour - violating couplings of @xmath8 , the present data on @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing implies a very high np scale of order @xmath11@xmath12 tev depending on whether the new contributions enter at loop- or at tree - level .",
    "in contrast , theoretical considerations on the higgs sector , which is responsible for the mass generation of the fundamental particles in the sm , call for np at order @xmath13 tev . as a consequence , any np below the @xmath13 tev scale must have a non - generic flavour structure .",
    "in addition , also the present electroweak data indicate a slightly higher np scale , a data - driven problem known as little hierarchy problem .",
    "the present measurements of @xmath14 decays , especially of fcnc processes , already significantly restrict the parameter space of np models . in general such bounds from flavour physics",
    "are model - dependent , but often much stronger than the ones derived from other measurements . in any case",
    ", the indirect flavour information will be most valuable when the general nature and the mass scale of np will be known .",
    "_ perturbative contributions : _ among the rare decay modes , the inclusive decay @xmath16 is the most important one , because it is theoretically well - understood and at the same time it has been measured extensively at the @xmath14 factories . while non - perturbative corrections to this decay mode are subleading and recently estimated to be well below @xmath17",
    "@xcite , perturbative qcd corrections are the most important corrections . within a global effort ,",
    "a perturbative qcd calculation to the next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic order level ( nnll ) has quite recently been performed and has led to the first nnll prediction of the @xmath18 branching fraction  @xcite with a photon cut at @xmath19 ( including the error due to nonperturbative corrections ) : @xmath20 this result is based on various highly - nontrivial perturbative calculations  @xcite .",
    "the combined experimental data leads to ( heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag )  @xcite ) @xmath21 where the first error is combined statistical and systematic , and the second is due to the extrapolation in the photon energy .",
    "thus , the sm prediction and the experimental average are consistent at the @xmath22 level .",
    "this is one important example that the ckm theory is not only confirmed by the data entering into the ckm unitarity fit , but also by many additional flavour mixing phenomena .    _ nonperturbative contributions : _ it was noted long ago  @xcite , that there is no local ope for the inclusive decay @xmath16 if one considers operators beyond the leading electromagnetic dipole operator @xmath23 .",
    "then , there are so - called _ resolved _ photon contributions which contain subprocesses in which the photon couples to light partons instead of connecting directly to the effective weak - interaction vertex  @xcite . only recently",
    ", a systematic analysis  @xcite of all resolved photon contributions related to other operators in the weak hamiltonian has established this breakdown of the local ope within the hadronic power corrections as a generic result . clearly , estimating such nonlocal matrix elements",
    "is very difficult , and an irreducible theoretical uncertainty of @xmath24 for the total @xmath25 averaged decay rate , defined with a photon - energy cut of @xmath26 gev , remains  @xcite .",
    "this result strongly indicates that the theoretical efforts for the @xmath27 mode have reached the nonperturbative boundaries , but it also reconfirms the dominance of the perturbative contributions .",
    "there is another positive result induced by this new analysis : until recently , it was believed that the long - distance contributions from the intermediate @xmath28-quark in the penguin loops are critical .",
    "they are suppressed in the @xmath29 mode by the ckm matrix elements . in @xmath30",
    ", there is no ckm suppression , and one must account for the nonperturbative contributions that arise from the @xmath28-quark loops . a simple dimensional estimate leads to an uncertainty of at least @xmath17 .",
    "however , this contribution vanishes in the total @xmath25-averaged rate of @xmath31 at order @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this result applies to the total rate of @xmath33 as well .",
    "thus , there is no power correction due to the @xmath28-quark loops in the total rate of @xmath33 at order @xmath32 , which implies that the @xmath25-averaged decay rate of @xmath34 is as theoretically clean as the decay rate of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the present nll - prediction reads  @xcite ( for @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 the large ckm - uncertainty is due to @xmath37 .",
    "the uncertainty due to the charm - scheme dependence can be reduced significantly by a nnll analysis in analogy to @xmath16 .",
    "already the nll prediction in combination with the first real measurement of this inclusive mode  @xcite leads to interesting bounds on np  @xcite .",
    "but there is also a negative consequence : without cp - averaging the non - perturbative the @xmath28-quark contribution survives and dominates the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath38 .",
    "perturbative contributions exhibit a triple suppression ; one has an @xmath39 suppression in order to have a strong phase , a cabibbo suppression of @xmath40 , and a gim suppression of @xmath41 reflecting the fact that in the limit @xmath42 the direct cp violation vanishes .",
    "thus , the non - perturbative ( resolved ) @xmath28-quark contribution is enhanced by a factor @xmath43 compared to the perturbative contributions .",
    "model estimates of the resolved contribution lead to  @xcite @xmath44 which covers most of the experimentally allowed range  @xcite : @xmath45 but the untagged direct cp asymmetry _ survives_.",
    "all resolved contributions cancel at order @xmath32 , so we still have the zero - prediction for the untagged cp asymmetry for @xmath46  @xcite . this prediction is directly based on the ckm - unitarity and on the smallness of the u - spin breaking parameters @xmath47 . thus , it represents a clean test whether new cp phases are active or not .",
    "_ there are still some open issues in the decay @xmath16 _ which ask for further study .",
    "first , there are three - loop matrix elements of the leading four - quark operators , which have first been calculated within the so - called large-@xmath48 approximation  @xcite .",
    "a calculation that goes beyond this approximation by employing an interpolation in the charm quark mass @xmath49 from @xmath50 to the @xmath49 value has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this interpolation",
    "the @xmath51 result  @xcite is assumed to be a good approximation for the complete @xmath52 result for vanishing charm mass .",
    "it is this part of the nnll calculation which is still open for improvement .",
    "indeed , there are several collaborations presently working on this issue .",
    "a complete calculation of the three - loop matrix elements of the four - quark operators @xmath53 for vanishing charm mass is in progress and will cross - check the error estimate due to the interpolation  @xcite .",
    "partial results are already available  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is an effort  @xcite to calculate the matrix elements for arbitrary @xmath49 directly .",
    "all these efforts will finally eliminate the @xmath54 uncertainty due to the interpolation within the present nnll prediction  @xcite .",
    "second , in the measurement of the inclusive mode @xmath31 one needs cuts in the photon energy spectrum to suppress the background from other @xmath14 decays which induces additional sensitivities to non - perturbative physics .",
    "these shape - function effects were taken into account in the experimental analysis .",
    "the corresponding theoretical uncertainties due to this model dependence are reflected in the extrapolation error of the experimental results .",
    "the extrapolation is done from the experimental energy cut values down to @xmath55 . but a cut around @xmath56 might not guarantee that a theoretical description in terms of a local ope is sufficient because of the sensitivity to the additional scale @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "a multiscale ope with three short - distance scales @xmath58 , and @xmath59 has been proposed to connect the shape function and the local ope region .",
    "recently , such additional perturbative cutoff - related effects have been calculated to nnll precision by the use of scet methods  @xcite .",
    "such perturbative effects due to the additional scale are negligible at @xmath60 but of order @xmath54 at @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the size of these effects at @xmath62 is similar to the @xmath54 higher - order uncertainty in the present nnll prediction .",
    "however , the numerical consistency of the scet analysis has recently been questioned  @xcite . far away from the endpoint ( @xmath63 gev ) , the logarithmic and nonlogarithmic terms cancel ; this kind of cancellation was already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . within the resummation of the cutoff - enhanced logarithms this feature leads to an overestimate of the @xmath64 terms  @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to clarify this issue .",
    "third , the @xmath16 decay rate is normalized to the _ charmless _ semileptonic rate in order to separate the charm dependence .",
    "then the quantity @xmath65 / \\gamma [ b\\to x_u e \\bar\\nu ] $ ] enters the theoretical prediction .",
    "recently , a scheme dependence in the determination of the prefactor @xmath66 was noticed  @xcite , which is around @xmath54 , thus within the perturbative uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "the two determinations in the @xmath67 scheme  @xcite and in the kinetic scheme  @xcite differ through renormalization schemes , methodology , and experimental input .",
    "an update of the analysis within the @xmath67 scheme might resolve part of the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "_ perturbative contributions : _ this inclusive mode is also dominated by perturbative contributions , if one eliminates @xmath69 resonances with the help of kinematic cuts . in the so - called ` perturbative @xmath70-windows ' below and above the resonances , namely in the low - dilepton - mass region @xmath71 , and also in the high - dilepton - mass region with @xmath72 , theoretical predictions for the invariant mass spectrum",
    "are dominated by the perturbative contributions .",
    "qcd corrections are calculated to nnll precision  @xcite .",
    "more recently electromagnetic corrections were calculated : nll quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) two - loop corrections to the wilson coefficients are of @xmath73  @xcite . also ,",
    "in the qed one - loop corrections to matrix elements , large collinear logarithms of the form @xmath74 survive integration if only a restricted part of the dilepton mass spectrum is considered .",
    "these collinear logarithms add another contribution of order @xmath75 in the low-@xmath70 region for @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "for the high-@xmath70 region , one finds @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "_ quark - hadron - duality : _ the integrated branching fraction of @xmath78 is dominated by the resonance background which exceeds the nonresonant charm - loop contribution by two orders of magnitude .",
    "as has been recently noticed  @xcite , this feature should not be misinterpreted as a striking failure of global parton - hadron duality which postulates that the sum over the hadronic final states , including resonances , should be well approximated by a quark - level calculation  @xcite .",
    "crucially , the charm - resonance contributions to the decay @xmath78 are expressed in terms of a phase - space integral over the absolute square of a correlator .",
    "for such a quantity global quark - hadron duality is not expected to hold .",
    "nevertheless , local quark - hadron duality ( which , of course , also implies global duality ) may be reestablished by resumming coulomb - like interactions  @xcite .",
    "_ qcd factorization : _ the method of qcd factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite and its field - theoretical formulation scet  @xcite form the basis of the up - to - date predictions of exclusive @xmath14 decays .",
    "there is also a factorization formula for the exclusive semileptonic @xmath14 decays , such as @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic form factors can be expanded in the small ratios @xmath32 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the energy of the light meson .",
    "if we neglect corrections of order @xmath83 and @xmath39 , the _ seven _ a priori independent @xmath84 form factors reduce to _ two _ universal form factors @xmath85 and @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical simplifications of the qcdf / scet approach are valid to the kinematic region in which the energy of the @xmath87 is of the order of the heavy quark mass , that is , @xmath88 .",
    "thus , factorization formula applies well in the dilepton mass range @xmath89 .",
    "_ full angular analysis : _ in the near future , a full angular analysis will become possible .",
    "this rich information allows for the design of observables with specific np sensitivity and reduced hadronic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "these observables are constructed in such a way that the soft form factor dependence cancels out at leading order in @xmath39 and in @xmath32 for all low dilepton masses , and they have much higher sensitivity to new right - handed currents than observables that are already accessible via the projection fits  @xcite . in these optimized observables ,",
    "the unknown @xmath32 corrections are the source of the largest uncertainty .",
    "further detailed np analyses of such angular observables have been presented in refs .",
    "a full angular analysis provides high sensitivity to various wilson coefficients , but the sensitivity to new weak phases is restricted , mainly due to large experimental uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "observables defined at high-@xmath70 also represent very interesting observables due to the fact that @xmath32 corrections can be estimated with the help of heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , but formfactors at high-@xmath70 have to be presently extrapolated from the low-@xmath70 region  @xcite .    th thanks the organizers of the conference for the interesting and valuable meeting and the cern theory group for its hospitality during his regular visits to cern where",
    "part of this work was written .",
