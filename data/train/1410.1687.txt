    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is that comoving space is rigid , a property that is shared by newtonian models ( see sect .",
    "2.5 in @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption needs to be tested .",
    "we propose to test the rigidity of a well - established comoving - scale standard ruler , by examining whether it is environment - dependent .    motivated by @xcite , the scalar averaging approach to cosmology ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) is a general - relativistic approach to cosmology that extends the friedmann and acceleration equations to the case of general inhomogeneous distributions of matter _ and geometry_. initial observational tests show promising results for template metric implementations of the approach and for related toy models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also models with the inclusion of a phenomenological lapse function : @xcite or using a different averaging approach : @xcite )",
    ".    comoving space in these approaches is not rigid .",
    "this implies that comoving standard rulers should be inferred to be variable in comoving length if data are interpreted according to a phenomenological , rigid model , e.g. a @xmath5cdm model .",
    "it is generally expected @xcite that voids should be hyperbolic and that superclusters should occupy positively curved space . this is a kinematical expectation , whose details depend on whether we interpret the backreaction variables in a background - free way , or whether we use template metrics to interpret those variables @xcite .",
    "when using a template metric , or a best - fit flrw metric , voids and superclusters and their nearby surroundings should approximately correspond to negatively curved , fast expanding regions and to positively curved regions approaching their turnaround epochs , respectively .    a comoving standard ruler at @xmath6 , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak , has been detected to high statistical significance ( * ?",
    "* and references thereof ) , where the comoving length is determined from the theory of baryon acoustic oscillations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "measuring the bao peak location  an imprinted feature in comoving space  through either large voids or superclusters for a given catalogue interpreted in rigid ( flrw ) comoving space should show either a stretched or compressed bao peak location , respectively , in comparison to the bao peak location for the full catalogue , interpreted in the same way .",
    "however , since voids dominate spatial 3-volume at the present epoch , the scalar averaging expectation is that the bao peak location through large voids should only be _ slightly _ greater than that for the best - fit flrw model @xcite , i.e. difficult to detect .",
    "moreover , voids consist of deficits of galaxy densities rather than excesses of galaxy densities , so procedures of finding and characterising voids are more affected by poisson noise than in the case of superclusters .",
    "thus , the relative stretching of the bao peak location through voids should be small compared to the best - fit flrw model , and noisy .    as a rough guide to what could be expected in the scalar averaging case",
    ", we prepared an independent software package that implements the calculations illustrated in fig .  2 ( left ) of @xcite for the relativistic zeldovich approximation @xcite together with an early - epoch background model @xcite .",
    "we find that present - day effective ( averaged ) expansion factors @xmath7 of typical ( 1@xmath8 in the first invariant of the extrinsic curvature tensor and zero in the second and third invariants ; see @xcite for details ) overdense or underdense regions at the 105 scale have effective scale factors of 0.95 or 1.04 times that of the extrapolated background model , i.e. the overdense region is about 9   compression is the relevant quantity to consider here .    instead of checking whether the bao peak location through voids is stretched ,",
    "a more promising approach is to use superclusters .",
    "lines of sight passing through superclusters should pass through the compressed spatial regions , while lines of sight mostly passing far from the superclusters should pass mostly through negatively curved space , according to the scalar averaging models . while superclusters are unvirialised objects ( typically of filamentary or spiderlike morphology ; e.g. @xcite ) , they should not dominate the volume , so the metrical properties of the space they occupy are more likely to differ from volume - weighted mean quantities than in the case of voids .",
