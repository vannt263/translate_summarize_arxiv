    "heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies are performed to create and characterize quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a phase of strongly interacting matter at an energy density where quarks and gluons are no longer bound within hadrons .",
    "quarkonia states ( @xmath3 and @xmath1 ) have been one of the most popular tools since their suppression was proposed as a signal of qgp @xcite .",
    "quarkonia are produced early in the heavy ion collisions and if they evolve through the deconfined medium their yields should be suppressed in comparison with those in pp .",
    "the first such measurement was the anomalous @xmath3 suppression discovered in pbpb collisions at @xmath4 gev at the sps , which was considered as a hint of qgp formation .",
    "the rhic measurements in auau at @xmath5 gev @xcite showed almost the same suppression at a much higher energy contrary to the expectation @xcite .",
    "such an observation was consistent with the scenario that at higher collision energy the expected greater suppression is compensated by regeneration of @xmath3 by recombination of two independently produced charm quarks  @xcite .",
    "after the lhc started pbpb collisions at @xmath6 tev , a wealth of results have become available on quarkonia production @xcite .",
    "the suppression of quarkonia in pbpb collisions can quantify the colour screening properties of strongly interacting matter @xcite or alternatively the thermal gluon dissociation cross section of quarkonia @xcite .",

    "the inverse of the gluon dissociation process is also used to estimate regeneration @xcite . there have been many recent calculations to explain the lhc results on quarkonia using a combination of above theoretical frameworks and models @xcite .    the cms experiment with its muon detection capabilities",

    "the measurement of suppression of hadrons containing different quarks flavours can constrain various energy loss mechanisms @xcite .    the quarkonia yields in heavy ion collisions are also modified due to non - qgp effects such as shadowing , an effect due to the change of the parton distribution functions inside the nucleus , and dissociation due to hadronic or comover interactions @xcite . to get a quantitative idea about these effects , measurements in ppb collisions at @xmath8 tev",
