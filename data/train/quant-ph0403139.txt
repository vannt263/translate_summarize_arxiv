    "a strong electromagnetic fields can perturb an atom in many unexpected and complicated ways that are difficult to understand . if the atom is initially in an excited state usually a large number of unperturbed bound states are coupled , making the numerical solution of schrdinger s equation difficult .",
    "moreover , the corresponding classical dynamics is normally partially chaotic  meaning that there are both unstable and stable orbits close to the initial unperturbed torus  and the wave function mimics this behaviour , see for instance leopold and richards 1994 and richards 1996b , thus making the interpretation of numerical solutions difficult .    the investigation of the effects of strong periodic fields on an excited atom dates from the original experiments of bayfield and koch ( 1974 ) which showed that a relatively weak field could produce a multiphoton transition into the continuum , contrary to the received wisdom of quantal perturbation theory .",
    "the subsequent history of this interesting problem is told by koch ( 1990 ) . in 1974 conventional quantal theory",
    "required high - order perturbation theory to describe the 80 photon jumps to the continuum of this early experiment .",
    "this was , and remains , an impossible calculation , but theory was rescued by delone _",
    "et al _ ( 1978 ) who proposed that the classical ionisation mechanism involved diffusion of the electron through atomic states highly perturbed by the field .",
    "a year later meerson _ et al _ ( 1979 ) proposed a different classical diffusion approximation . in the same year",
    "leopold and percival ( 1979 ) used a classical monte - carlo trajectory method to estimate classical ionisation probabilities and obtained qualitative agreement with experiment . in 1985",
    "the experiment was repeated with better control of all important parameters and the comparison between these results and a classical monte - carlo simulation , van leeuwen _ et al _ ( 1985 ) , showed remarkable agreement .    since then our understanding of the dynamics of this type of system and the relationship between classical and quantal solutions in different parameter regimes has developed .",
    "for instance we now know that the scaled frequency  the ratio between the driving frequency and the kepler frequency of the initial unperturbed motion  is one of the most significant parameters and that there are six separate scaled frequency regions in which the dynamics has quite different characteristics , see for instance koch and van leeuwen ( 1995 ) .",
    "linearly polarised fields with low scaled - frequencies were considered in richards _",
    "et al _ ( 1989 ) and there it was found that at particular scaled frequencies quantal effects were important due to resonances between two adiabatic states , see also dando and richards ( 1993 ) .",
    "low frequency elliptically polarised fields , bellermann _ et al _ ( 1996 , 1997 ) and koch and bellermann ( 2000 ) , showed the existence of complicated resonance structures that , on the other hand , can be explained using classical dynamics , richards ( 1997 ) .",
    "when the scaled frequency is close to unity the main classical resonance island plays a dominant and similar role in both the classical and quantal dynamics , except at certain frequencies where scars produce differences , leopold and richards ( 1994 ) and richards ( 1996b ) . at higher scaled frequencies",
    "classical dynamics fails , as predicted by casati _",
    "et al _ ( 1984 ) , and demonstrated by galvez _ et al _ ( 1988 ) for linearly polarised fields and , for elliptically polarised fields , by wilson ( 2003 ) .",
    "these different behaviours have been the subject of several reviews jensen _ et al _ ( 1991 ) , koch ( 1990 , 1995 ) , koch and van leeuwen ( 1995 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider the effect of strong , parallel static and oscillatory fields on an excited hydrogen atom , the work being motivated by recent experiments of professor koch s group .",
    "these two fields affect the system in complicated ways .",
    "roughly , the static field splits the hydrogen degeneracy introducing another frequency to the system with which the external field can resonate .",
    "classically this means that the kepler ellipse moves periodically and this motion can resonate with the driving field .",
    "such resonances can enhance the ionisation probability so a significant part of this paper is devoted to understanding the dynamics of these resonances and the mechanism causing enhanced ionisation .",
    "preliminary experimental results and some comparisons with classical monte - carlo calculations are given in galvez _",
    "et al _ ( 2000 ) ; a more detailed discussion of the experimental method with more extensive results and comparisons with classical calculations is provided in galvez _",
    "et al _ ( 2004 ) , subsequently referred to as i.    in these experiments excited hydrogen atoms are subjected to strong parallel static and periodic fields , so the external force on the electron is @xmath0 : the accurate theoretical description of this system present a challenge .",
    "the main observed effect of this field combination is to produce an ionisation probability that , for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 , rises steadily as @xmath3 is increased , but which is punctuated by a series of approximately equally spaced sharp local maxima , see for instance galvez _",
    "et al _ ( 2000 , figure  1 ) and figure  [ f:1 ] of this paper .",
    "each local maximum is produced by a resonance between the periodic part of the perturbation , @xmath4 , and the mean rotational motion of the kepler ellipse induced by the static part , @xmath5 .",
    "these peaks are relatively narrow but their shapes , widths and heights vary significantly with the system parameters .",
    "moreover , they disappear at certain values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , for reason that are sketched in galvez _ et al _ ( 2000 ) ; similar explanations are provided by oks and uzer ( 2000 ) and ostrovsky and horsdal - pedersen ( 2003 ) .",
    "since publication of the original galvez _ et al _ ( 2000 ) paper we have made detailed comparisons between the ionisation probabilities of the experiment and classical monte - carlo simulations , which will be published in galvez _",
    "et al _ ( 2004 ) .",
    "these comparisons show remarkable agreement in many instances , but also some differences , some of which may be attributed to unquantifiable differences between the assumed substate distribution . in experiment and calculations",
    "we observe systematic differences between both the positions of the resonances and of their disappearances and the predictions of the simple theories . in an attempt to understand these differences more detailed numerical investigations of the classical dynamics",
    "were undertaken and these calculations show that the dynamics underlying the apparently simple , averaged results seen in figure  [ f:1 ] is , in fact , very complicated : even an accurate theoretical prediction of positions of the local maxima in the ionisation probability is fraught with difficulties in classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "further , it transpires that the nature of the resonance that causes these maxima is unusual in that the classical resonant island moves as the field is switched on : in some circumstances this means that the classical ionisation probabilities reflect the development of a homoclinic tangle , see figure  [ f:18a ] and  [ f:18b ] .",
    "the size of the quantum numbers needed for the quantum dynamics to mimic this behaviour is not known .",
    "this paper has two main aims .",
    "first , to provide a theoretical understanding of the classical dynamics and to isolate those features that determine the nature of these resonances , for example their positions and temporal development .",
    "second we need to derive an approximate hamiltonian that leads to a numerically tractable schrdinger equation .",
    "both aims are achieved by using a representation in which coupling between basis states is relatively small .    in section  [ sec : not ] notation is defined and we present some numerical results illustrating the theoretical problems that need to be solved . in section  [ sec : thry ] the approximations are developed ; this is algebraically complicated but , in essence , it is simply a standard use of perturbation theory and averaging approximations . however , for two reasons care is need with this theory .",
    "first , the convergence of the perturbation expansion needs to be understood because the fields used are strong and , it transpires , sometimes beyond the radius of convergence of the series .",
    "second , it is shown that particular observable effects are produced by subsets of terms and it is necessary to determine their origin because only some subsets can be computed to high order  this means that some effects , such as the resonance positions , can be computed to high order , but others can not .",
    "this analysis is necessary partly to extend the earlier approaches beyond first order and partly to show how ionisation occurs , a feature missing from all earlier theories of this system .",
    "furthermore , from this analysis emerges an approximate hamiltonian that should facilitate a quantal calculation .    in section  [ sec :",
    "res - ion - i ] the mechanism connecting the dynamical resonances , described in section  [ sec : thry ] , with ionisation is described .",
    "a significant result of this analysis is that the positions of the dynamical resonance is not precisely the same as the positions of the local maxima seen in ionisation curves ; although small , an estimate of the difference seems beyond current theory . in this section",
    "we determine some necessary conditions for a dynamical resonance to affect ionisation and also obtain accurate estimates for the position at which the resonances observed by galvez _ et al _ ( 2000 ) disappear , see also schultz ( 2003 ) and schultz _ et al _",
    "we also discuss resonance widths and show that for the current experiments , which involve an average over substates , the width is _ not _ due to the variations of the resonance position with substate ( which is relatively small ) , but is due mainly to non - adiabatic dynamical effects , that are difficult to quantify .    in section  [ sec : time - scale ] we analyse the time required for a resonance to develop and show this to be relatively long .",
    "further , we observed that the nature of the resonance island means that the classical ionisation probability can be significantly affected by the field envelope .",
    "in particular in some circumstances the ionisation probability can reflect an incipient homoclinic tangle that develops as the initial state moves slowly through a separatrix .",
    "[ sec : not ] the hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in parallel static and microwave electric fields , as in the experiments of galvez _ et al _ ( 2000 , 2004 ) ( the latter henceforth being referred to as i ) , is derived in leopold and richards ( 1991 ) and , provided the field envelope @xmath6 changes sufficiently slowly , is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the atomic reduced mass , @xmath9 the electron charge and @xmath6 is the envelope function describing the passage of the atom through the cavity .",
    "this hamiltonian has azimuthal symmetry so the @xmath10-component of angular momentum , @xmath11 , is conserved . for the particular experiments described in  i ,",
    "@xmath6 has the 16 - 113 - 16 configuration , meaning that it rises monotonically from zero to unity in 16 field periods , remains constant for 113 periods and then decreases monotonically to zero in 16 periods . in all calculations reported here the initial rise over @xmath12 field periods is taken to be @xmath13 and the decrease as the field is switched off has the same shape .",
    "classical ionisation probabilities are normally insensitive to small changes in @xmath6 ; exceptions to this rule are discussed in section  [ sec : envel ] .    for excited atoms it is convenient to use units defined by the initial unperturbed kepler ellipse which has semi - major axis @xmath14 and frequency @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the initial values of principal action and quantum number respectively : scaled units are convenient because the magnitude of most scaled parameters that produce similar physical effects change little with @xmath18 .",
    "the scaled frequency and field amplitude are defined by @xmath19 the scaled time is @xmath20 and a scaled action @xmath21 is @xmath22 . in the current experiment , so @xmath23 . in the following we use the symbols @xmath3 and @xmath1 for both",
    "the scaled and actual field amplitudes and @xmath24 for scaled and actual time : this misuse of notation avoids a clutter of subscripts but should not cause confusion because scaled quantities are dimensionless .      before describing the theory we show the results of a few classical calculations in order to provide the reader with an idea of the features that a theory needs to describe . for the present calculations a monte - carlo method , as described in abrines and percival ( 1966 ) , is used in which @xmath25 initial conditions are chosen from a microcanonical ensemble : if @xmath26 of these orbits ionise the estimate of the ionisation probability is @xmath27 . without stratification",
    "the standard deviation of this estimate is ( hammersley and handscomb , 1964 ) @xmath28 meaning that there is a 68% and 95% probability of the true result being in the ranges @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . in the present calculations",
    "the sample of initial conditions is stratified by dividing the range of each variable into equally probable intervals and choosing , from a microcanonical distribution , one point at random in each sub - interval , see abrines and percival ( 1966 ) .",
    "stratification reduces the statistical errors and sample calculations suggest that with this form of stratification the true value of @xmath31 is about half the above estimate . for the numerical integration of hamilton s equations",
    "the problem associated with the coulomb singularity is circumvented by using the regularisation method described in ( rath and richards 1988 ) : numerical integration was performed with the nag routine d02caf .    in the first figure",
    "is shown a ` typical ' classical ionisation curve in which @xmath1 and @xmath32 are fixed and the variation of the ionisation probability , @xmath33 , with the static field @xmath3 is shown : here a microcanonical distribution of substates is used .",
    "for this illustration we choose @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 : the field envelope was 16 - 80 - 16 and 1296 orbits , for each value of @xmath3 , were used .",
    "the broad features are clear : @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 for large @xmath3 , typically . as @xmath3 increases between these values the steady increase in @xmath40",
    "is punctuated only by sharp local maxima at almost equal intervals in @xmath3 , at @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; a close inspection of the data shows another small maximum at @xmath44 , marked by the arrow .",
    "the small amplitude undulations seen in this ionisation curve are assumed to be caused by the statistical errors mentioned above , and provide a visual estimate of the magnitude of these errors .",
    "the variation in the scale - length of these oscillations in @xmath3 is due to variations in @xmath3-interval used in the calculations which was smallest near the local maxima of @xmath33 .",
    "we denote the positions of these maxima in @xmath40 by @xmath45 .",
    "theory associates these maxima with a resonance between the driving field and the precession of the atomic kepler - ellipse and we denote the position of these resonances by @xmath46 .",
    "the two field values @xmath46 and @xmath45 are approximately the same but are not identical , which is why it is helpful to use different symbols .    elementary consideration , section  [ sec : resham ] , show that @xmath47 ( in scaled units ) , giving 0.0327 , 0.0653 , 0.0980 and 0.131 , so the relative differences between @xmath48 and @xmath45 are 3.5% , 5.3% , 7% and 9% respectively . the more accurate theory developed in section  [ sec : res - ion - ii ] ,",
    "gives @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for @xmath53 - 4 , with relative differences of 0.5% , 1.3% and 7% , respectively , for @xmath54 , 3 and 4 , with the values for @xmath53 agreeing to three figure accuracy .",
    "the averaged ionisation probabilities disguises a richer and more complicated behaviour . in the next three figures",
    "are shown ionisation probabilities from a given substate , @xmath55  these scaled actions are defined below , equation  [ eq:2 - 08a ] and  [ eq:2 - 08b ] .",
    "here @xmath56 , ( @xmath57 ) , and 1600 orbits , for each @xmath3 , were used . the arrows point to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined in equation  [ eq : st30 ] below .    at the lowest microwave field ,",
    "@xmath60 , a number of local maxima are seen : those labelled @xmath53-@xmath61 can be associated with a dynamical resonance , and most are visible for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for @xmath60",
    "there are also a number of other local maxima , at @xmath64 and @xmath65 the origin of which is not known , but in section  [ sec : time - scale ] results are presented which suggest that the maximum at @xmath66 is a non - integer resonance , equivalent to @xmath67 ; in this example @xmath37 for @xmath68 and @xmath39 for @xmath69 , with an underlying steady increase in @xmath40 for @xmath70 .    for @xmath62",
    "the four labelled maxima of the previous figure persist but have shifted slightly and the @xmath71 maxima has split : we have confirmed that the latter effect is not due to statistical sampling errors . in other calculations with the shorter rise time of four field periods",
    "there is no split , suggesting that it is caused by the field envelope : this and other effects of the field envelope are discussed in the section  [ sec : envel ] .",
    "the @xmath53 maximum near @xmath72 is lower and the theory developed below shows that it disappears completely for @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "a new feature in this graph is the large value of @xmath33 at @xmath75 , with @xmath33 falling rapidly to zero as @xmath3 increases to @xmath76 . for @xmath77",
    "the underlying trend in @xmath33 is a steady increase to unity , but all other structure is not understood .",
    "for @xmath78 the three labelled maxima persist , but have shifted and broadened . now @xmath33 is large for @xmath38 and @xmath79 and there is a new maximum at , the existence and magnitude of which depends upon the switch - on time , see figure  [ f:5 ] : we have confirmed that , at these low frequencies , @xmath33 is affected insignificantly by the switch - off time , provided the total interaction time is sufficiently long .",
    "the numerical details of the resonance positions seen in these figures are given in table  [ t:01 ] . here",
    "the values of @xmath45 are computed using a grid @xmath80 and defining @xmath45 to be the value of @xmath3 at which @xmath40 has a local maximum . if @xmath81 for a range of fields , the range is quoted and sometimes there is more than one clear maximum .",
    "for fixed @xmath1 and increasing @xmath82 there are clear systematic differences between these two values .",
    "it is not known what causes these differences ; the breakdown of the perturbation expansion used to compute @xmath46 maybe significant , but also the discussions in sections  [ sec : res - ion - ii ] and  [ sec : envel ] , show that the relation between the values of @xmath46 and @xmath45 is far from simple .",
    ".[t:01 ] values of @xmath45 , computed by the method described in the text , and @xmath46 given by the theory described in section  [ sec : res - ion - ii ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this data shows that , for this low frequency , the above simple estimate of the spread is reasonable for @xmath83 , and that it is comparable with the difference between the @xmath45 and @xmath46 , given in columns 2 and 3 of table  [ t:10 ] and to the resonance width , column  5 . note also that as @xmath82 increases , and @xmath84 tends towards the radius of convergence of the series for @xmath85 , the difference decreases : it is not known if this effect is real or due to the approximations used .",
    "although the position of the dynamical resonance is very weakly dependent upon @xmath11 its effect on @xmath40 can depend strongly upon @xmath11 , because @xmath86  that is the solution of @xmath87  depends upon @xmath11 : for instance with @xmath88 , @xmath86 varies from @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) to @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the shapes of the resonances seen in the experimental data and the classical simulations are complicated . in particular",
    "the resonances are not normally symmetrical about @xmath45 , with details depending upon @xmath1 and @xmath82 . here",
    "we show show the classical widths can be defined and computed and discuss some of the reason for the shapes observed .",
    "a detailed comparison between the classical simulations and the experimental data is provided in the companion paper , galvez _ et al _",
    "( 2004 ) , and there it is shown that the experimental results display the same complexities .    in order to estimate the widths it is necessary to isolate the resonances from the background .",
    "this is achieved by noting that on either side of the resonance @xmath40 increases approximately linearly , figure  [ f : w01 ] below .",
    "the background may be eliminated by subtracting these straight line segments from @xmath40 to give an adjusted probability that is approximately zero on both sides of the resonance , as shown on the right of figure  [ f : w01 ] .",
    "the only complication with this procedure is that the straight line segments have different gradients , so we form a new fit to the background , @xmath93 , where the gradient , @xmath94 , and constant , @xmath95 , change smoothly between the values either side of the resonance , @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "if the straight line segments are on the intervals @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with @xmath100 , ( chosen by eye ) we set @xmath101 with a similar fit for @xmath102 .    in the following two figures we show how this process works for the @xmath54 resonance with @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 , which is a fairly typical example : in these calculations a microcanonical distribution of initial states with 1296 orbits , for each value of @xmath3 ,",
    "is used and the envelope is 16 - 113 - 16 .    360120width-fig.eps a graph of the @xmath54 resonance for @xmath104 @xmath106 with @xmath105 . on the left is the ionisation curve with the straight line fits , as described in the text . on the right",
    "is the difference , having subtracted the background.f : w01    the left hand panel of figure  [ f : w01 ] shows that either side of a resonance @xmath40 is approximately linear , but with different gradients .",
    "the difference between these gradients changes with @xmath1 and , of course , is zero when the resonance disappears .",
    "the right hand panel shows the graph of @xmath107 which highlights the resonance shape ; this is clearly asymmetrical about the maximum .",
    "the graph shown is typical though the degree of asymmetry changes with @xmath82 and  @xmath1 .",
    "the position of the resonance , the two gradients @xmath108 and @xmath109 and the width of the adjusted ionisation probability all provide tests for any theory .",
    "comparisons of these parameters obtained from classical calculations and experiment are given in galvez _",
    "et al _ ( 2004 ) .",
    "in this particular example @xmath110 : the width at half - height is about @xmath111 , with the base being nearly 4 times wider , 0.007 .",
    "the calculated position of this dynamical resonance varies from @xmath112 @xmath113 to @xmath114 @xmath115 .",
    "the spread in @xmath116 due to the variations in @xmath11 is therefore about @xmath117 , about @xmath118 of the @xmath119-height width seen in figure  [ f : w01 ] : this difference is fairly typical .",
    "we now consider some of the factors determining the resonance shapes , and show how these are partly determined by a combination of substate averaging and non - adiabatic effects .",
    "consider ionisation from a given substate : for illustrative purposes choose @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath90 , @xmath105 and use a 4 - 50 - 4 envelope with initial conditions @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "this data also shows that as @xmath133 increases and the adiabatic boundary encroaches upon each resonance it broadens , acquires an asymmetry and eventually disappears .",
    "in other cases , when @xmath134 , an ionisation boundary can also encroach from the left , figure  [ f:8 ] , and this will also change the resonance shape .",
    "this example , which is typical , suggests that the width and shape of the microcanonical averaged resonances is caused mainly by the effect of the separatrix between bound and free motion , which distorts nearby resonances , rather than the variation in the resonance position with @xmath11 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to provide theoretical estimates of the resonance width and shape .",
    "[ sec : time - scale ] the classical adiabatic ionisation mechanism , described in section  [ sec : ion ] , suggests that , in the absence of a resonance , ionisation occurs when @xmath135 reaches a critical value defined by the condition @xmath136 : at this time ionisation from a particular orbit occurs within a kepler period .",
    "this behaviour has been checked numerically when @xmath75 ( rath , 1990 ) and the results of the present calculations , where @xmath137 , show the same behaviour . with increasing scaled frequency",
    "the dynamics becomes less adiabatic although this behaviour persists , albeit with the boundaries becoming blurred ; this behaviour is seen clearly in figure  2 of richards  ( 1996a ) .",
    "the classical ionisation mechanism at a resonance is different because here for an orbit to be ionised it must first be transported into a region of large @xmath133 , that is smaller @xmath138 , by motion round the resonance island .",
    "hence the rate of ionisation will depend upon the period of this motion ; at the island centre this is given approximately by equation  [ eq : per01 ] , which shows the period to be @xmath139 .",
    "thus we should expect the time dependence of the ionisation probability on and off resonance to be quite different .",
    "these predictions can be checked by computing the time at which @xmath140 reaches a given proportion of its final value . in the following figure",
    "we show two graphs which allow comparison of this ionisation time with the ionisation probability .",
    "the upper graph is the ionisation probability , @xmath40 , for @xmath56 @xmath141 , @xmath60 starting in the initial state @xmath142 , using a 16 - 50 - 16 envelope and 1600 orbits , which is the same as in figure  [ f:2 ] : the lower graph is the time , @xmath143 , at which @xmath140 reaches half its final value : with @xmath143 is measured in units of the field period : the horizontal line is at @xmath144 , the time when the field amplitude reaches its maximum .",
    "there are several features of this comparison worthy of note .",
    "( )    for @xmath145 ionisation occurs close to end of the switch - on time , @xmath144 . since @xmath146 the adiabatic condition suggests , that away from resonances and these initial conditions , bound states exist only for @xmath147 .",
    "at the @xmath53 , 2 and 3 resonances , ionisation occurs some time after the field has reached its maximum amplitude , with the longest delay occurring at the edges of the resonance and the shortest near the maximum in @xmath33 .",
    "this is consistent with the description given in section  [ sec : res - ion - i ] , where it is shown that close to the resonance edge transport is near the separatrix where motion is slowest .",
    "the formula  [ eq : per01 ] for @xmath148 , gives , for these parameters , the @xmath149-period near the resonance island centre of about @xmath150 , which is consistent with the lower graph of figure  [ f : time ] .",
    "the local maximum in @xmath143 at @xmath151 can not , at present , be explained .",
    "the ionisation time near the local maximum in @xmath33 at @xmath152 has the same shape as those near the @xmath53 and @xmath153 resonances , but ionisation clearly takes longer , suggesting that this structure is due to a higher - order resonance .",
    "linear interpolation between the @xmath53 - 3 resonances suggests this could be the @xmath67 resonance .",

    "second - order perturbation theory applied to the mean motion hamiltonian  [ eq : st15 ] does not appear to give @xmath156 resonances ; this suggests that higher harmonics of @xmath157 are required and these occur , at this level of averaging , only if higher order terms of @xmath158 and @xmath159 , equations  [ eq:2 - 10a ] and  [ eq : app - ang04 ] , are included .",
    "for @xmath160 the boundary at @xmath161 is begining to affect the dynamics and seems to be interfering with the @xmath71 resonance .",
    "[ sec : envel ] in the previous section it was shown how resonance islands affect ionisation times . here",
    "we examine the effect of the envelope switch - on time , @xmath162 , on a particular resonance . at this point",
    "it is useful to recall that the dynamical resonances discussed here are unusual because each exist only for a narrow range of @xmath3 and within this interval the resonance island moves from the lower to the upper edge of phase space , see figures  [ f:10]-[f:14 ] .",
    "moreover , the motion inside a resonance island is very slow , equation  [ eq : per01 ] .",
    "if @xmath163 , for some @xmath82 , then for most of the switch - on period the resonance island does not exist .",
    "but for some time close to @xmath164 the island develops at the bottom edge of phase space and as @xmath165 it moves up through phase space and through the initial phase line . as this happens",
    "the line is distorted , with the amount of distortion depending upon the relative values of @xmath166 and the frequency of the motion in the island . for short switch times",
    "the initial phase line @xmath127 evolves into a nearby line at @xmath167 , as shown in the left panel of figure  [ f : separ ] below . for relatively long switch times",
    "there may be enough time for the initial phase line to develop an incipient homoclinic tangle and become quite complicated , as seen in the right panel of figure  [ f : separ ] .",
    "the examples considered next show how changes in the switch - time , @xmath164 , can dramatically affect the ionisation probability .",
    "the demonstration of this effect is in two parts .",
    "first we show some exact numerical results illustrating how the ionisation probability changes with @xmath164 . in this example we chose the low frequency , @xmath168 ,",
    "( @xmath169 ) , @xmath170 , @xmath60 and examine @xmath40 in the vicinity of the @xmath171 resonance for the envelope @xmath12 - 50-@xmath12 , for @xmath17240 . from table",
    "[ t:10 ] we see that when @xmath173 , @xmath40 has its maximum at @xmath174 and that the resonance width is @xmath175 .    in the following two figures we show how @xmath40 changes with @xmath12 : for these calculations we used 900 orbits and a grid @xmath176 , so there are 50 data points for each unit of @xmath177 .",
    "the first figure shows ionisation probabilities for @xmath172 - 17 .",
    "the variation of @xmath33 with @xmath12 shows a surprising amount of variation ; in particular we note that for @xmath178 the ionisation probability is _ zero _ across the resonance .    also observe that @xmath45 changes by @xmath179 for @xmath12 in this range , and that this is comparable to the resonance width . this explains why an unambiguous relation between @xmath46 and @xmath45 does not exist .    in the next two figures",
    "are shown the ionisation probabilities for @xmath180 . with these longer switch times more structure",
    "for instance , with @xmath181 and 36 , @xmath40 has two local maxima and for both @xmath181 and 37 the probability has a long , low plateau after the maximum .",
    "a qualitative explanation of these feature is given next .",
    "the behaviour depicted in figures  [ f:18a ] and  [ f:18b ] can be understood qualitatively using a combination of the mean - motion hamiltonian , equation  [ eq : swit01 ] below , and the resonance hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that initially the system is in a given @xmath133-state with its conjugate variable uniformly distributed in @xmath182 .",
    "this initial phase line , @xmath183 , evolves during the switch - on period in the mean - motion hamiltonian : in scaled units , with @xmath184 , this is @xmath185 where @xmath186 . for @xmath187 ( and before the switch - off time ) , @xmath188 and this hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath189 where @xmath190 . near the @xmath82th resonance this can be approximated by the resonance hamiltonian , @xmath191 where @xmath192 is defined after equation  [ eq : st20a ] and @xmath193 , ( @xmath187 ) .    during the period",
    "@xmath194 the initial phase curve evolves according to the hamiltonian  [ eq : swit01 ] into the line @xmath195 .",
    "hence by plotting the line @xmath195 and the contours of @xmath196 ( the dashed lines ) , we obtain a qualitative picture showing how @xmath33 can be affected by the field switch .    in the following three figures we show the separatrix of @xmath196 and the line @xmath195 for @xmath197 , @xmath62 , @xmath198 , @xmath170 and the initial state @xmath199 , when @xmath172 , 3 and 35 : the field values are slightly different from those used to generate figures  [ f:18a ] and  [ f:18b ] because an approximate hamiltonian is used .    for @xmath172 the line",
    "@xmath195 is close to the initial line , @xmath199 .",
    "slightly less than half of @xmath195 lies inside the separatrix and these orbits will be transported to regions of larger @xmath133 and some will ionise depending upon the value of @xmath86 .    for @xmath200",
    "the curve @xmath195 is more distorted ; a smaller proportion of orbits lie inside the separatrix , but all of these are close to it and will all be transported to larger @xmath133 than the equivalent points of the previous example .    for @xmath201 , @xmath195 has developed a complicated shape due to the motion inside the island . in this example a significant proportion of the orbits inside the separatrix are close to the horizontal line through the island centre , so will not be transported to regions of large @xmath133 .",
    "clearly this structure is very sensitive to changes in @xmath12 and this sensitivity will be reflected in @xmath33 .",
    "these figures provide a qualitative explanation for the complications seen in figures  [ f:18a ] and  [ f:18b ] .",
    "in particular they show why there is no simple , precise relation between @xmath46 and @xmath45 ; they also show that the dynamics underlying the apparently simple resonances seen in figure  [ f:1 ] is very complicated .",
    "in this paper we examine the behaviour of a classical hydrogen atom in parallel static and microwave fields , with frequencies that are low by comparison to the unperturbed orbital frequency .",
    "there are three main reason why the classical atom is considered .",
    "first , it is not necessary to make dynamical approximations in order to numerically integrate the classical equations of motion .",
    "the errors of the estimated ionisation probability are determined mainly by the monte - carlo sampling errors and with modern computers these can be made acceptably small .",
    "this is in contrast to quantal calculations in which unquantifiable approximations have to made in order to solve the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "second , within the framework of classical dynamics there is a range of easily applied approximations that help provide understanding of observed phenomena .",
    "the corresponding approximations are not so easy to apply to either schrdinger s of heisenberg s equations of motion .    finally , using techniques of analytical dynamics it is possible to construct an approximate hamiltonian , which provides a fairly accurate approximation to the exact classical dynamics , see figure  [ f:8 ] , and which may be used as a basis for feasible quantal calculations .",
    "the main effects of interest here are the resonances between the microwave field and the stark frequency induced by the static field .",
    "these resonances were first observed by galvez _ et al _ ( 2000 ) and",
    "this paper also presents the first theory to describe these resonances qualitatively .",
    "it was shown how these resonances are responsible for an enhanced ionisation signal over a narrow range of static field strengths , for fixed microwave field amplitude and frequency .",
    "additionally these signals disappear at particular combinations of the two field amplitudes and recent experiments , schultz ( 2003 ) , galvez _ et al _ ( 2004 ) and schultz _ et al _ ( 2004 ) , have extended the measurements of these `` disappearance fields '' .    since the first observations of these resonances",
    "three theoretical papers describing the phenomena from different perspectives have been published .",
    "oks and uzer ( 2000 ) use a floquet analysis to derive zero - order estimates of @xmath46 and @xmath202 . robicheaux _",
    "et al _ ( 2002 ) have solved schrdinger s equation for this problem using a split - operator method and have made comparisons with the classical and experimental ionisation probabilities for @xmath203 across the @xmath53 resonance with @xmath204 .",
    "these calculations suggest that the classical and quantal values of @xmath205 are very close , but that quantal value of @xmath33 is smaller than the classical value for @xmath206 . in addition the time - dependence of the ionisation probability is described for three values of @xmath3 and this appears to contradict the results summarised in figure  [ f : time ] , though it is difficult to make comparisons between substate averaged and unaveraged data .",
    "ostrovsky and horsdal - pedersen ( 2003 ) use an energy shell subspace with a time - dependent electric field and weak , perpendicular magnetic field , with the aim of understanding oscillations seen in the experimental result , subsequently attributed to another cause , see wilson _ et al _",
    "this analysis is based on the same type of averaging approximation that leads to the hamiltonian  [ eq : st15 ] , see also born ( 1960 , section  38 ) , and inevitably gives zero - order estimates of @xmath46 and @xmath202 .    in this paper",
    "we have described the classical dynamics of this system in more detail : in particular more accurate values of @xmath46 and @xmath202 are determined and the properties of the classical resonances are described in some detail .",
    "we now list these features and discuss the probable consequences to the quantum mechanics .    )",
    "[ note : conc1]we have established that the position of the dynamical resonance , @xmath46 , as computed by theory , is not at precisely the field @xmath45 , at which the ionisation probability is largest , although @xmath207 .",
    "further , we have shown , numerically , that the difference @xmath208 can depend on the field envelope .    [",
    "note : conc2]we have isolated the terms in the hamiltonian that give rise to the dynamical resonance .",
    "this allows the computation of the dynamical resonance position using high - order perturbation theory ; where this series converges we obtain improved estimates of the resonance position .",
    "this analysis is essentially the same as the corresponding quantal theory which we therefore expect to give the same result .",
    "further , this suggests that the discrepancy noted in  ( [ note : conc1 ] ) above will also occur in an accurate quantal calculation .",
    "[ note : conc3]using a classical approximation , based on two stages of averaging , we have derived a number of conditions necessary for the dynamical resonance to affect the ionisation probability .",
    "these depend upon properties of the classical resonance island , the most significant being the island width .",
    "a dynamical resonance affects the ionisation probability only if it is wide enough to bridge the gap in phase space between the initial state and those states that ionise , see section  [ sec : res - ion - ii ] . because the ratio of these two actions is independent of the initial principal number ,",
    "we expect a similar story in the quantal description , though quantal effects will inevitably blur these boundaries .",
    "this suggests that there may be cases where a resonance not seen in the classical ionisation probabilities will be visible in the quantal probabilities .    besides the island width",
    ", its area also plays a role in quantum mechanics ; this area is proportional to the initial principal quantum number , @xmath18 , so we expect the resonances seen here and in current experiments to change , and possibly disappear , as @xmath18 decreases",
    ".    [ note : conc4]the resonances in the ionisation probability , not averaged over substates , are generally very sharp , see for instance figure  [ f : n21a ] and table  [ t:10 ] .",
    "the full - width of an isolated resonance is generally smaller than its theoretical shift produced by changing @xmath209 , as seen by comparing the data presented in tables  [ t:10 ] and  [ t:11 ] .",
    "however , resonances near an adiabatic boundary are significantly broadened and asymmetries are introduced , figure  [ f : w03 ] and  [ f : w04 ] .",
    "this causes substate - averaged resonances to be far wider than isolated resonances , and also affects their shape .",
    "the classical dynamics of this process is complicated and not understood .",
    "because the experimentally observed resonances behave in a similar fashion , we expect a similar dynamical effect in any quantal calculation , but understanding this is harder than understanding the classical dynamics .    [",
    "note : conc5]the shape of an isolated classical resonance and the value of @xmath45 , with no substate averaging , can be affected by the field envelope , if the fields are switched on sufficiently slowly , see figures  [ f:18a ] and  [ f:18b ] .",
    "these changes are caused by the phase line representing the initial state becoming tangled as the separatrix of the resonance island passes through it , see figure  [ f : separ ] .",
    "we expect this behaviour to be seen in the quantum dynamics provided the principal quantum number is large enough , but how large is not known .",
    "[ note : conc6]classical resonances develop over a time scale that is much longer than that of the ionisation process operating away from resonance .",
    "this is because , at resonance , ionisation happens by transport around the resonance island and this is a relatively slow process .",
    "further , across a resonances the ionisation time appears to reflect the island dynamics .",
    "for instance , at the edge of a resonance the ionisation time is longest because motion near the separatrix is very slow : this and other , not understood , features are seen in the lower panel of figure  [ f : time ] .    as with point  [ note : conc5 ]",
    "above , we should expect to see similar behaviour in a quantal calculation , provided the principal quantum number is sufficiently large , but how large is not known .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank professor peter koch for valuable discussions and encouragement during all stages of this work , and for helpful comments on drafts of this manuscript .",
    "the derivation of the required results is easiest if scaled variables are used . if @xmath210 is any scale length and @xmath17 an action , suitable scaled variables are @xmath211 taking @xmath17 to be the initial value of @xmath212 and @xmath210 the semi - major axis of the initial kepler ellipse , @xmath213 we have @xmath214 in the following these scaled units are used but for clarity the tilde is not shown .",
    "most of these results are obtained using a maple program to manipulate the series , which were computed to higher - order than quoted here .      for @xmath215 set @xmath216",
    "so equation  [ eq:2 - 08a ] becomes @xmath217 where @xmath218 . in the parameter range of interest",
    "@xmath219 has three real roots , two positive @xmath220 ( with @xmath221 only when @xmath90 ) and one negative root , @xmath222 .",
