    "the effect of channel coupling , that is , couplings of the relative motion between the colliding nuclei to their intrinsic motions as well as transfer reactions , have been well known in heavy - ion collisions around the coulomb barrier . in heavy - ion fusion reactions at sub - barrier energies ,",
    "the channel coupling effects enhance considerably the fusion cross sections as compared to the prediction of potential model calculation @xcite .",
    "it has been well established by now that the channel coupling gives rise to a distribution of potential barriers @xcite .",
    "based on this idea , a method was proposed to extract barrier distributions directly from experimental fusion excitation functions by taking the second derivative of the product of center mass energy , @xmath3 , and the fusion cross section , @xmath4 , with respect to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "coupled - channels calculations as well as high precision fusion data have shown that the fusion barrier distributions , @xmath5/de^2 $ ] , is sensitive to the details of channel couplings , while the sensitivity is much more difficult to see in the fusion cross sections @xcite .",
    "similar information as the fusion cross section can also be obtained from the quasi - elastic scattering ( a sum of elastic , inelastic and transfer processes ) at backward angles @xcite .",
    "measured the quasi - elastic scattering cross section for several systems @xcite , for which the fusion barrier distribution had already been extracted @xcite .",
    "they proposed that the corresponding barrier distribution can be extracted by taking the first derivative of the ratio of the quasi - elastic to the rutherford cross sections , @xmath6 , with respect to the energy , @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath7",

    "one of the systems which timmers _ et al . _",
    "measured is @xmath1o@xmath2sm @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the comparison of the experimental barrier distribution extracted from fusion ( the filled circles ) and quasi - elastic ( the open squares ) processes . in order to compare the two barrier distributions , we scale them so that the energy integral between @xmath9= 56 and 70 mev is unity . for energies below 62 mev ,",
    "the two barrier distributions resemble each other",
    ". however , at higher energies , they behave rather differently , although the overall width of the distributions is similar to each other .",
    "that is , the quasi - elastic barrier distribution decreases monotonically as a function of energy while the fusion barrier distribution exhibits a distinct peak at energy around @xmath10 mev .",
    "so far , no theoretical calculations have succeeded in explaining this difference .",
    "the coupled - channels calculations of timmers _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with the computer code ecis @xcite , which took into account the one quadrupole , @xmath11 , and the one octupole , @xmath12 , phonon excitations of @xmath0sm , were unable to reproduce both the experimental data of the quasi - elastic cross sections and the quasi - elastic barrier distribution .",
    "the ecis results for the ratio of quasi - elastic scattering to the rutherford cross sections fall off more steeply than the experimental data , while the obtained barrier distribution has a secondary peak similar to the fusion barrier distribution .",
    "they argued that this failure is largely due to the residual excitations not included in the ecis calculations , which they postulated to be transfer channels .",
    "esbensen and buck have also performed the coupled - channels calculations for this system taking into account the second order couplings @xcite .",
    "however , they did not analyze the quasi - elastic barrier distribution .",
    "these previous coupled - channels calculations took into account only the single phonon excitations in @xmath0sm . on the other hand , hagino _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the double anharmonic quadrupole and octupole phonon excitations play an important role in reproducing the experimental fusion barrier distribution for this system . however",
    ", its effect on the quasi - elastic scattering has not yet been clarified so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is then to study weather the double anharmonic vibrational excitations of the @xmath0sm nucleus can explain the difference in the shape of barrier distribution between fusion and quasi - elastic .",
    "the role of proton transfer reactions in this system is also discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly explain the coupled - channels formalism which takes into account the anharmonicities of the vibrational excitations .",
    "we present the results of our calculations in sec .",
    "we then summarize the paper in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the coupled - channels formalism which includes the effects of anharmonic excitations of the vibrational states .",
    "we follow the procedure of refs .",

    "the effect of anharmonicities for the quadrupole and octupole vibrations are taken into account based on the u(5 ) limit of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the operator @xmath24 in eqs.([vcoupc ] ) and ( [ vcoupn ] ) then read @xcite ,    @xmath25\\ ] ]    for 6 low - lying states ( @xmath26=1 - 6 ) , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . in eq.(5 ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the quadrupole and the octupole deformation parameters , respectively , which can be estimated from the electric transition probabilities .",
    "the scaling of coupling strength with @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the number of boson in the system , is introduced to ensure the equivalence between the ibm and the geometric model in the large @xmath36 limit @xcite . when all the @xmath37 parameters in eq.(5 ) are set to be zero then the quadrupole moment of all the states vanishes , and",
    "one obtains the harmonics limit in the large @xmath36 limit .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath37 generate the quadrupole moments , and , together with finite boson number , they are responsible for the anharmonicities in the vibrational excitations .",
    "we now apply the formalism to analyze the quasi - elastic scattering data of @xmath1o@xmath2sm @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed with a version @xcite of the coupled - channels code ccfull @xcite once the coupling matrix elements are determined from eq.(5 ) .",

    ", the regular boundary condition is imposed at the origin instead of the incoming wave boundary condition .      in the calculations presented below ,",
    "we include only the excitations in the @xmath0sm nucleus whilst the excitations of the @xmath1o is not explicitly included . for sub - barrier fusion reactions ,",
    "the latter has been shown to lead only to a shift of the fusion barrier distribution in energy without significantly altering its shape @xcite , and hence can be incorporated in the choice of the bare potential .",
    "this is a general feature for reactions with the @xmath1o as a projectile .",
    "we have confirmed that it is the case also for the quasi - elastic barrier distribution .",
    "that is , although the @xmath1o excitations contribute to the absolute value of quasi - elastic cross sections themselves , the shape of quasi - elastic barrier distribution is not altered much .",
    "since we are interested mainly in the difference of the shape between the fusion and the quasi - elastic barrier distributions , we simply do not include the @xmath1o excitations and instead adjust the inter - nuclear potential .    for simplicity , we take the eigenvalues of the @xmath18 in eq.(1 ) to be @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the number of quadrupole and octupole phonons , respectively . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the excitation energies of the quadrupole and the octupole phonon states of the target nucleus , _",

    "5(a ) that the inclusion of proton transfer reactions overestimates the experimental @xmath6 at energies between 62 and 68 mev .",
    "also the higher peak in the quasi - elastic barrier distribution becomes more distinct and thus worsens as compared to the calculation without the transfer channels .",
    "figure 6 shows the contribution of each channel to the quasi - elastic cross sections . the fraction of each contribution is also shown in fig . 7 .",

    "the overestimation of the quasi - elastic cross section indicated in fig .",
    "5(a ) is therefore largely due to the contribution of elastic channel .    from this study",
    ", we conclude that the inclusion of the proton transfer reactions in the coupled - channels calculations does not explain the difference of the shape between the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions for the @xmath1o@xmath2sm system .",
    "we have argued that the presence of high energy shoulder , instead of high energy peak , in the quasi - elastic barrier distribution for the scattering between @xmath1o and @xmath0sm nuclei can not be accounted for within the present coupled - channels calculations , which take into account the anharmonic double phonon excitations in @xmath0sm as well as the proton transfer channels .",
    "figure 8 compares the calculated fusion barrier distribution @xmath72 and the corresponding quasi - elastic barrier distribution @xmath60 for several coupling schemes as shown in fig . 2 in the coupled - channels calculations .",

    "figure 8(c ) is the result of the double anharmonic vibration coupling . from these figures ,",
    "it is evident that the theoretical fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions are always similar to each other within the same coupling scheme , although the latter is slightly more smeared due to the low - energy tail @xcite .",
    "this would be the case even with the excitations in @xmath1o as well as neutron transfer channels , which are not included in the present coupled - channels calculations .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that the experimental fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions can be explained simultaneously within the standard coupled - channels approach .",
    "we have studied the effects of double anharmonic vibrations of the @xmath0sm nucleus on the large angle quasi - elastic scattering for @xmath1o@xmath2sm system .",
    "we have shown that the experimental data for the quasi - elastic scattering cross sections for this reaction can be reasonably well explained .",
    "however , we found that the obtained quasi - elastic barrier distribution still shows the clear doubled - peaked structure , that is not seen in the experimental data .",
    "this was not resolved even if we took the proton transfer channels into account .",
    "our coupled - channels calculations indicate that , within the same coupling scheme , the quasi - elastic and fusion barrier distributions are always similar to each other . although detailed analyses including neutron transfer channels in a consistent manner are still necessary , it is thus unlikely that the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions can be explained simultaneously with the standard coupled - channels framework .",
    "this fact might be related to the large diffuseness problem in sub - barrier fusion , in which dynamical effects such as couplings to deep - inelastic scattering are one of the promising origins @xcite .",
    "it is still an open problem to perform the coupled - channels calculations with such dynamical effects and explain the difference of the shape between the fusion and the quasi - elastic barrier distributions for the @xmath1o@xmath2sm reaction .",
