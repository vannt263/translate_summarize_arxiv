    "the preparation of states of a system is one of the primitive notions in quantum theory @xcite .",
    "it consists of a set of rules for preparing a physical state of a given system in the laboratory and for associating a corresponding mathematical state in the hilbert space defined by the system . in this paper",
    "we examine how entangled states can be used for state preparation .",
    "this is of interest in quantum information theory , quantum computing and in the preparation of special states such as the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite .",
    "the specific question addressed is , `` after a measurement is completed on a subset of particles in an entangled state , what is the state of the remaining particles ? ''",
    "we can formulate this as a special case of general correlation measurements in which one set of measurements must be completed before any further measurements are made .",
    "that is , the first measurement or set of measurements acts as a trigger which defines the state of the remaining particles .",
    "alternatively , we may use the language of probability theory and say that we are studying a conditional amplitude of a subsystem , conditioned by the outcome of the measurement of a second subsystem ..    an interesting example of state preparation is found in quantum teleportation @xcite . recall that in this case bob and alice share an entangled two particle state , @xmath0 and alice is given an arbitrary state , @xmath1 she makes a filtering measurement on the two particle state composed of her part of the entangled state and the unknown state .",
    "this measurement yields one of the four orthogonal bell states for the pair ac @xmath2 after her measurement is completed , the particle in bob s hands is in a definite state depending on which result alice obtained .",
    "therefore , if alice knows the state she is given , she can view this procedure as the preparation of one of four definite state in bob s laboratory .",
    "of course , alice can not predict which of the four states will be produced before she makes her measurement .",
    "that bob ends up with this state is perfectly understandable mathematically ; however , the interpretation of what has happened is controversial since it takes us into questions of the epistemology of quantum mechanics .",
    "the particle in bob s laboratory goes from having no state to a definite state with only local measurements being performed by alice .",
    "this is a stark example the non - local nature of quantum theory .    in this paper ,",
    "i want to discuss the mundane issues of experiments like this and ask if a part of an entangled state is measured by a detector with finite time resolution , what is the state of the `` undisturbed '' part system .",
    "we must be more precise in defining what it means for a system to be in a definite state @xcite .",
    "we wish to argue that a single preparation procedure produces a definite state , but to do so the procedure must be tested a number of times . for a pure state , the testing procedure means that there are measurements , which can be idealized as projection measurements , such that @xmath3 for each realization of the procedure that produces the state @xmath4 for example , if we wish to prepare an electron with its spin up along some axis , then a stern - gerlach measurement along that axis is a physical realization of @xmath5 if the prepared state is @xmath6    for a mixed state , @xmath7 , @xmath8 the situation is even more complicated .",
    "it is not sufficient to have a filtering measurement , idealized as a complete set of orthogonal projections @xmath9",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 if we repeat the preparation many times , the result @xmath12 occurs with frequency approaching @xmath13 , but there are an infinite number of density matrices @xmath14 with diagonal entries @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 therefore , the prescription for checking whether the prepared state is @xmath7 requires a set of measurements that determine the off - diagonal elements of @xmath18 the important point is that in principle there is a method of testing a given procedure to determine if each time it is preformed it produces the state @xmath14@xcite@xmath17 having done this , we are allowed to argue that a single such procedure will produce the state @xmath18 of course , in practice , we are much less rigorous , relying on theory and a few measurements to argue that a given state is prepared .    the generalization from projective measurements to positive operator valued measurements ( povm ) @xcite , @xcite is not difficult .",
    "in fact , the measurements that are discussed below are more closely related to general povm s than to projective measurements .",
    "for the idealized case , we assume that idealized projection measurements can be made instantaneously . let @xmath19and @xmath20 be hilbert spaces and consider the space defined by their direct product .",
    "suppose we have a normalized bipartite state @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath20 . if the outcome of an idealized filtering measurement of the complete set of projection operators @xmath25 gives the result @xmath26 the state of particle @xmath27 is instantaneously projected into the state @xmath28 this is sometimes referred to as the collapse of the wave function .. the acausal behavior of quantum theory is inherent in the fact that we can not predict , in principle , which @xmath29 the measurement of @xmath30 will yield .",
    "the non - local nature of quantum mechanics is displayed by particle @xmath27 going from not being in a definite state to being in a definite state even if it is far away from particle @xmath31 in a realistic theory , such as bohm s theory @xcite , for each realization of the experiment , particles @xmath30 and @xmath27 have definite trajectories determined in part by a non - local quantum potential acting between the particles .",
    "when we determine the trajectory on which particle @xmath30 lies , the trajectory of particle @xmath27 will be altered because the non - local potential acting on it changes .",
    "it is well - known that there is no superluminal signal in this case , nothing has been transferred by the measurement of particle @xmath30 to the neighborhood of particle @xmath27 until a signal from the output of measuring apparatus @xmath30 reaches @xmath32 in other words , as soon as measurement @xmath30 is completed the detector at @xmath30 has acquired @xmath33 bits of information .",
    "the same amount of information can be acquired by detector in the location of @xmath27 by either measuring the state of particle @xmath27 or receiving a signal from detector @xmath30 containing the result of the measurement .",
    "now consider a less ideal case in which the measurement on @xmath30 is a povm , @xmath34 .",
    "after the measurement , the state of @xmath27 is given by the density matrix @xmath35 where @xmath36 in general , this is a mixed state . only in the special case",
    "that @xmath37 factors into @xmath38 is @xmath39 a pure state .",
    "this is shown in appendix1 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath40 for any @xmath41 such that @xmath42 this limits the state that can be prepared by measuring particle @xmath43 this is important in the generalization of teleportation . in order for it to be possible to teleport a state , that state must be present in the entangle state shared by alice and bob .",
    "the discussion that follows will be given in terms of the heisenberg picture , but it is not difficult to convert to a schrdinger picture .",
    "we shall treat the particles as photons , although the conversion to any other type of particle is not difficult .",
    "we start by specifying the measuring devices . according to glauber @xcite ,",
    "the detector operator for a photon linearly polarized along the @xmath44 direction is , the positive frequency electric field operator @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the destruction operator for a photon linearly polarized in the @xmath44 direction with frequency @xmath48 .",
    "the time is measured in distance units so that the speed of light is one .",

    "the detector records a quantity proportional to the intensity or , equivalently , the counting rate , @xmath57 where from here on we introduce the retarded time @xmath58 the outcome of the measurement depends on @xmath59 and @xmath60 the duration of the measurement @xmath61 determines the degree to which off - diagonal matrix elements of the state are detected .",
    "the function @xmath62 determines spectral region to which the detector is sensitive .",

    "1 it can be seen that if @xmath72 the sinc function can be replaced by @xmath30 over the range of summation and ( [ intensity ] ) becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 this means that we can resolve the envelope of the wave packet by moving the detector with respect to the source .",

    "this case corresponds to placing a narrow filter in front of the detector and is often used in practice .",
    "now suppose that a two photon entangled state is generated with one photon moving to the right and the other to the left , @xmath85 the linear polarization states are defined with respect to the orthogonal directions @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the result of the measurement selects the state of particle l.    a contentious issue in the interpretation of quantum mechanics is whether the uncertainty principle reflects a fundamental limitation on how well conjugate variables can be determined because of the basic quantum nature of measurement , as heisenberg believed @xcite .",

    "the uncertainty changes because the experiment dictates that we compute it with a conditional probability .. only those states of the particle @xmath154 are considered which are associated with the triggering of the right detector and this conditioning depends on the nature of the detector through @xmath150 and @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the fact that measurements do not necessarily induce uncontrolled uncertainty in the sense of heisenberg is by now well - known from the discussion of the quantum erasure @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a three particle state that is the product of an entangled two particle state and an independent one particle state .",
    "this type of state is discussed in the original teleportation paper @xcite . in that case , the measurement is performed on two of the particles and a single particle state is prepared . alternatively , by measuring one of the particles in the entangled state , one can prepare a state of the two remaining particles .",

    "we have also seen how a measurement of one particle from an entangled pair can lead to a partially entangled state of an independent particle and the second particle form the pair .",
    "this is done by mixing the unmeasured pair on a beam splitter .",
    "however , the entangled pair that is produced is not composed of identical states in the two outputs . for this to occur , it is again necessary that the independent state and the entangled state have spectral amplitudes that are related .",

    "i believe , popper would argue that what we are dealing with is a statistical distribution which says nothing about the properties of individual particles . however , we know from the study of electromagnetic theory that we can explain single slit diffraction as a scattering involving currents in the wall of the screen and the field in the slit . in this more complete theory ,",
    "the near field depends on the nature of the material composing the screen , but , remarkably , the field a few wave lengths beyond the slit primarily depends on the geometry of the slit .",

    "regard , heisenberg was correct , for each individual particle such physical effects are present and place physical limitations on how well we can determine the values of conjugate variables .",
    "note that bohm s theory , which ascribes definite values the position and momentum of each particle , does not allow us to measure the state of a single particle any more precisely than quantum theory does .",
