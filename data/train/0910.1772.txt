    "the theory of time- and space - homogeneous random walks on @xmath1 ( @xmath11 ) , i.e. , sums of i.i.d .",
    "random integer - component vectors , is classical and extensive ; see for example @xcite . for random walks that are not spatially homogeneous the theory is less complete , and many techniques available for the study of homogeneous random walks can no longer be applied , or are considerably complicated ; see , for instance , @xcite . in the present paper we study angular properties of non - homogeneous random walks , specifically exit times from cones and",
    "existence of limiting directions .    in general non - homogeneous processes can be wild ; thus we restrict ourselves to walks that have mean drift that tends to zero as the distance to the origin tends to infinity ( but with no restriction on the direction of the drift ) and satisfy some weak regularity conditions on the jumps .",
    "we do not impose on the increments of the random walk conditions of boundedness , symmetry , or uniform ellipticity , as are assumed , for example , for the results on non - homogeneous random walks in @xcite .",
    "importantly , we do not impose any direct restrictions on the correlation structure of the components of the increments of the process .",
    "random walk models are applied in many contexts . often , simplifying assumptions of homogeneity",
    "are made in order to make such models tractable , whereas non - homogeneity is more realistic .",
    "thus our non - homogeneous model shares some motivation with random walks in random environments ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; in such terms , our results deal with a particular class of ` asymptotically zero drift ' environments ( cf .",
    "example 5 in section [ examples ] below ) . in the present paper",
    "we develop methods to study passage - times for certain sets for such non - homogeneous random walks .",
    "we now describe informally the type of non - homogeneous random walk studied in the present paper .",
    "consider a markovian random walk on @xmath1 , homogeneous in time but not necessarily in space , so that the transition function depends upon the walk s current location .",
    "suppose that the walk has one - step mean drift function that tends to zero as the distance from the origin tends to infinity .",
    "this asymptotically zero drift regime is the natural setting in which to probe the transition away from behaviour that is essentially ` zero - drift ' in character . in one dimension ,",
    "the corresponding regime is rather well understood , following fundamental work of lamperti ; see @xcite and the appendix in @xcite ( some analogous results in the continuous setting of brownian motion with asymptotically zero drift are given more recently in @xcite ) .",
    "problems in higher dimensions of a ` radial ' nature can often be reduced to this one - dimensional case .",
    "the exit - from - cones problems that we consider in the present paper ( which we describe below ) , on the other hand , are to a large extent ` transverse ' ( and inhomogeneous ) in nature and so are truly many - dimensional .",
    "moreover , the many - dimensional case is qualitatively different from the one - dimensional case ( see theorem [ thm1 ] below ) .",
    "the random walks that we consider are non - homogeneous , but some regularity assumptions are certainly required for our results .",
    "we assume a _ weak isotropy _ condition without which highly degenerate behaviour is possible .",
    "in addition , we restrict our attention to random walks on unbounded subsets of @xmath1 with some moment condition on the jumps .",
    "we need some regularity conditions on the state - space of our walk and it is most convenient to take the structure of @xmath1 .",
    "we are confident that our proofs can be adapted for more general state spaces .",
    "our main theorems can be summarized as follows : ( i ) a walk with mean drift of magnitude @xmath12 at @xmath13 will leave any cone in finite time almost surely ( and indeed hit any cone ) , while ( ii ) an appropriate drift field with magnitude of order @xmath14 , @xmath7 can lead to the existence of an asymptotic direction for the walk ( so that it eventually remains in an arbitrarily thin cone ) .",
    "note that the class of random walks with mean drifts @xmath12 to which result ( i ) applies is very wide : such a walk can be transient , null - recurrent , or positive - recurrent ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and can be diffusive or sub - diffusive ( cf .",
    "* section 4 ) . )    before stating our theorems formally , we briefly describe some of the relevant existing literature .",
    "the theory of homogeneous zero - mean random walks stands hand - in - hand with the corresponding continuum theory for brownian motion .",
    "once the assumption of spatial homogeneity is removed , brownian motion ceases to be a reliable analogy for the random walk problem . in the case of one dimension , this is exemplified by results on processes with asymptotically zero mean drifts ; see e.g.  @xcite . for the non - homogeneous random walks considered in the present paper , we will demonstrate behaviour substantially different to that of standard brownian motion .",
    "in @xcite the authors give conditions under which our non - homogeneous random walk does display essentially ` brownian ' behaviour .",
    "the study of the exit - time of standard brownian motion from cones goes back at least to spitzer @xcite and a deep analysis was undertaken by burkholder @xcite ; see @xcite for some more recent work .",
    "the random walk case has received less attention .",
    "a body of work by varopoulos starting with @xcite deals with exit - from - cones problems for random walks that have _ mean drift zero _ but are ( at least for some of the results in @xcite ) allowed to be non - homogeneous . in @xcite , finer behaviour",
    "( such as tails of exit times ) was studied , and consequently the conditions on the walks imposed in @xcite are stronger than ours in several respects , such as an assumption of orthogonality on the covariance structure of the increments .    in the next section",
    "we give the precise formulation of the model , our main results , and a discussion .",
    "in particular , in section [ descr ] we formally define our model and our assumptions . in section [ results ] we state our main results . then",
    "in section [ examples ] we give several examples of processes to which our theorems can be applied , including ` centrally biased random walks ' , half - plane excursions , and a random walk in random environment model . in section",
    "[ open ] we mention some possible directions for future research .",
    "finally , in section [ outline ] we give a brief outline of the technical part of the paper , which contains the proofs of our results .",
    "in this section we describe more precisely the probabilistic model that is our object of study .",
    "first we collect some notation . throughout",
    "we assume @xmath15 and work in @xmath16 ; @xmath8 is the minimum number of dimensions in which the phenomena that we study appear , although analogues of our results in the case @xmath17 are in a sense provided by lamperti @xcite . for @xmath18 , write @xmath19 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the euclidean norm on @xmath16 . for a non - zero vector @xmath18 we use the usual notation @xmath21 for the corresponding unit vector .",
    "write @xmath22 for the origin and @xmath23 for the standard orthonormal basis of @xmath16 . for vectors",
    "@xmath24 we use @xmath25 to denote their scalar product .",
    "let @xmath26 be a discrete - time markov process with state - space @xmath27 an unbounded subset of @xmath1 .",
    "since we are concerned crucially with the spatial aspects of the process , it is natural to view our process a _ random walk _ on @xmath28 , although it will certainly not , in general , be a sum of i.i.d .  random vectors",
    ". the random walk @xmath29 will be time - homogeneous but not necessarily space - homogeneous ; we will impose some natural regularity assumptions on the increment distribution for our walk , which we describe next .",
    "we need to impose some form of regularity condition that ensures the walk can not become trapped in lower - dimensional subspaces or finite sets . to this end , we will assume the following weak isotropy condition :      note that ( a1 ) is an @xmath34-step regularity condition . in terms of one - step regularity ,",
    "its implications are minimal : a simple consequence of ( a1 ) is that for any @xmath35 @xmath36 = ( \\pr [ \\xi_{t+n_0 } = \\bx , \\ldots , \\xi_{t+1 } = \\bx \\mid \\xi_t = \\bx ] ) ^{1/n_0 } \\leq ( 1 - 2d\\kappa)^{1/n_0 } \\leq 1 - ( 2d\\kappa / n_0)\\ ] ] ( note @xmath37 ) so that @xmath38 \\geq ( 2d\\kappa / n_0 ) > 0\\ ] ] uniformly in @xmath13 .",
    "condition ( a1 ) can be seen as a form of ellipticity , but is weaker than uniform ellipticity ( such as often assumed in the random walk in random environment literature , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , there can be sites @xmath35 at which the jump distribution degenerates completely and the walk moves deterministically .",
    "( when later we discuss walks with asymptotically zero mean drift , for all @xmath13 with @xmath39 large enough this extreme degeneracy is excluded , although the jump distribution at @xmath13 may still be supported on a lower - dimensional subspace . ) at first sight it seems that we are losing some generality in ( a1 ) by enforcing a single @xmath40 and @xmath34 for each of the @xmath41 directions in the condition  but this is not in fact any sacrifice , as we show in proposition [ propa1 ] below ( see section [ open ] ) . finally , note that another consequence of ( a1 ) is that @xmath42 a.s ..    our time - homogeneity and markov assumptions imply that the distribution of the increment @xmath43 depends only on the position @xmath44 and not @xmath45 .",
    "our second regularity condition is an assumption of finiteness of second moments for the increments of @xmath29 :    * there exists @xmath46 such that @xmath47 \\leq b_0 .\\ ] ]    it is interesting that for our theorems and with our techniques @xmath8 moments suffice , rather than @xmath48 moments or uniformly bounded jumps as are often assumed in similar situations . under ( a2 ) , the mean of @xmath43 given @xmath49 is well - defined .",

    "vector @xmath50 $ ] for @xmath35 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the case where the random walk has _ asymptotically zero _ mean drift , i.e. , @xmath51 .",

    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 let @xmath55 be an open ( circular ) cone in @xmath16 with apex @xmath56 , principal direction @xmath57 , and half - angle @xmath58 : @xmath59    a central quantity in this paper is the random walk s first exit time from the cone @xmath60 ( starting from inside the cone ) . define the random time @xmath61 the notation @xmath62 suppresses the dependence on the starting point @xmath63 and the cone direction @xmath57 .",
    "note that the complementary cone @xmath64 has interior @xmath65 so exit from a large cone is equivalent to hitting a small cone .",
    "exit from a small cone does not in general imply hitting _ any _ small cone for a non - homogeneous random walk without some condition that prevents confinement of the walk to a subspace of @xmath16 .",
    "this is why we need a condition such as ( a1 ) . + * remark .",
    "* the time - homogeneity and markov assumptions that we make are not crucial for our results , and are not essentially used in our proofs . however , to avoid complicating the statements of our theorems we have not used the maximum generality in this respect .",
    "in fact , we essentially prove our theorem [ thm2 ] in the more general setting ( see section [ sectran ] ) .",
    "our first result , theorem [ thm1 ] below , deals with the case where the mean drift is @xmath4 ; we will see that this case is critical for our properties of interest .",
    "it is often useful to view our general model as a perturbation of the zero - drift case .",
    "it is perhaps intuitively clear , by analogy with brownian motion , that a zero - drift homogeneous random walk on @xmath1 satisfying suitable regularity conditions will exit any cone in almost surely finite time .",
    "note that care is needed even in the zero - drift case , since random walks with zero drift can behave very differently from brownian motion due to correlation structure of the increments : see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is less clear that such a result is true for random walks that are non - homogeneous and have an arbitrary correlation structure for their increments .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] provides the much stronger result that the exit time is a.s .",
    "finite in the _ asymptotically _ zero drift setting provided that the mean drift is @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , if this latter condition fails , the result may be false ( see theorem [ thm2 ] below ) ; in this sense , theorem [ thm1 ] is best possible .",
    "[ thm1 ] suppose that ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) hold , and that for @xmath35 as @xmath66 , @xmath67 then for any @xmath54 , any @xmath53 , and any @xmath68 @xmath69   = 1.\\ ] ]    as a special case , theorem [ thm1 ] includes the case of a non - homogeneous random walk with zero drift .",
    "the only similar result that we could find explicitly stated in the literature is in @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath70 a.s .  for a non - homogeneous random walk with mean drift zero under a condition of uniformly bounded jumps and several other technical conditions including assumptions on correlation structure of the jumps and conditions on the reversed process .",
    "thus theorem [ thm1 ] provides a proof of the result @xmath70 a.s .",
    "in the zero drift setting under conditions that are weaker in several directions ( in particular the assumptions on the increments ) than those in @xcite . the main object of @xcite was to address the more delicate question of obtaining tight bounds for the tail of @xmath62 . in our more general setting ( with mean drift _ asymptotically _ zero ) the tails of @xmath62 depend crucially on the drift field , even in the case where the mean drift is @xmath4 , or indeed identically zero , and we do not consider the problem of tail bounds in the present paper .",
    "however , in @xcite the authors do show that , for @xmath71 , if the mean drift is @xmath4 then @xmath62 has a _ polynomial _ tail under the condition of uniformly bounded jumps .",
    "for an informative example of the impact of increment correlation structure on the existence of exit - time moments in a simple setting , see @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that walks @xmath29 satisfying theorem [ thm1 ] can display a wide range of behaviour .",
    "for example , in the case of radial drift @xmath72 for @xmath73 , it can be shown by an analysis of the process @xmath74 ( possibly under some additional regularity assumptions ) that , depending on @xmath75 , @xmath29 can be positive - recurrent , null - recurrent , or transient ( see example 2 in section [ examples ] below ) and that @xmath29 can be diffusive or sub - diffusive ( see ( * ? ? ? * section 4 ) ) .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] contrasts sharply with the situation in one dimension @xcite , where a drift of @xmath76 at @xmath77 does not imply finiteness of the time of exit from a half - line . in @xmath71 , theorem [ thm1 ] gives information on the winding of the walk around the origin ; an early result on the winding number of planar brownian motion is also contained in spitzer s paper @xcite and a more recent reference , including corresponding results for homogeneous random walks , is @xcite .",
