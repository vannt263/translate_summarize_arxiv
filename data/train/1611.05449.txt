    "the geometry of spacetime can be inferred from physical measurements made with clocks and rulers or , more generally , using quantum fields , sources , and detectors .",
    "we assume the ultimate precision achievable is determined by quantum mechanics . in this paper",
    "we obtain a parameter - based quantum uncertainty relation , which bounds knowledge of spacetime , i.e. , of the gravitational field .",
    "such an uncertainty relation might become increasingly relevant to empirical observation as , for example , laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors are expected to approach quantum - limited sensitivity across a wide bandwidth in the near future .    we treat matter and nongravitational energy with quantum physics , whereas gravity is treated using classical general relativity . quantum gravity , without backreaction , could only increase the uncertainty of gravitational quantities .",
    "thus we use the theory of quantum fields propagating on classical spacetime backgrounds .",
    "we also work in the test - field approximation , wherein the gravitational field of the probe fields is ignored completely . for example",
    ", one might choose to ignore  and does in practice ignore  the gravitational field of the light in a gravitational - wave interferometer .",
    "backreaction , i.e. , allowing the quantized probe field to act as a source for the gravitational field , must impart its uncertainty to the gravitational field , for otherwise , by an argument given by  @xcite , the uncertainty principle for matter would be violated .",
    "thus we do not expect uncertainty in gravitational quantities to be less than that derived here .",
    "the problem of backreaction when measuring the structure of spacetime has already been studied in some detail  @xcite .    we know from heisenberg that there is an uncertainty relation between position and momentum .",
    "it states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum , for any quantum state , must be greater than a constant . in terms of the variances of position and momentum ,",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the reduced planck s constant .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation is derived in standard quantum mechanics , where position and momentum are both represented as hermitian operators .    a similar relation , albeit with a different interpretation , exists between time and energy : @xmath2 unlike position , time in standard quantum mechanics is a classical parameter .",
    "the time - energy uncertainty relation can be considered an example of a quantum limit on parameter estimation .",
    "there one tries to estimate a classical parameter , in this case time , by making measurements on a quantum system , a `` clock , '' whose evolution depends on time . in the time - energy uncertainty relation  ( [ teur ] ) , @xmath3 is the classical variance of the estimate of @xmath4 ; this classical variance arises ultimately from quantum uncertainties in clock variables conjugate to the hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "the most common way to make quantum mechanics compatible with classical relativity is to demote position to a parameter , just like time in the previous example .",
    "physical systems can then be thought of as living on , and interacting with , the classical spacetime manifold . in this relativistic context",
    ", the position - momentum uncertainty relation is also framed in the parameter - estimation .",
    "this way of thinking was used by braunstein , caves , and milburn  @xcite to develop optimal quantum estimation for spacetime displacements in flat minkowski spacetime . in spacetime , not only can one move a fixed proper distance or time , one can also boost and rotate .",
    "quantum parameter estimation was thus also developed for the parameters corresponding to these actions  @xcite .",
    "the results were developed with the quantized electromagnetic field as the measurement system .",
    "these results show that estimates of a spacetime translation can be made increasingly accurate as the uncertainty in the operator that generates the translation , boost , or rotation is made very  large .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in limits on measurements of the classical gravitational field . in general relativity",
    "the gravitational field is a manifestation of the geometry of spacetime , which is described by a metric .",
    "the metric determines the length of the invariant ( proper ) interval between two spacetime events and is given by  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the metric tensor , with indices @xmath8 for time and the three spatial cordinates .",
    "the @xmath9 are infinitesimal cordinate differences .",
    "we assume the einstein summation convention , where repeated upper and lower indices are summed over .",
    "before we describe the relevant quantum parameter estimation in detail , we ask the following : can any insight be found by applying the heisenberg uncertainty relation , in its parameter - based form , directly to a proper distance ?",
    "it was along these lines that unruh  @xcite derived an uncertainty relation for a component of the metric tensor .",
    "once cordinates are chosen , there should only be quantum uncertainty in the proper time and the proper distance . as these are in turn related to the metric via eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , any uncertainty in the proper distance is equivalent to uncertainty in the metric . by applying the heisenberg uncertainty relation to a proper distance",
    ", unruh found a simple , yet insightful uncertainty relation for one component of the metric .",
    "the unruh uncertainty relation for the @xmath10 component of the metric ( assuming particular cartesian - like cordinates ) , in terms of variances , is @xmath11 where here , and henceforth , we use units such that @xmath12 .",
    "the conjugate variable to @xmath10 is the corresponding component of the quantized stress - energy tensor , in this case the pressure  @xmath13 in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "the key feature of this uncertainty relation is the inverse proportionality to @xmath15 , the square of the four - volume of the measurement .",
    "we provide a general framework for deriving such an uncertainty relation , by formulating it as a problem in quantum estimation theory .",
    "the metric @xmath7 is defined for each point @xmath16 on the manifold .",
    "if the quantum measurement system , or probe , occupies some four - volume @xmath17 , then the system s state depends on the metric at every point in that region . if we consider the metric to be an arbitrary function on the manifold , then we need to estimate an infinite number of parameters to define it completely .",
    "instead , we consider regions of spacetime that can be described by metrics characterized by a single parameter @xmath18 .",
    "for example , the schwarzschild metric , which describes the spacetime around a static nonrotating black hole , is defined by the single parameter  @xmath19 , the mass of the black hole .",
    "the task is to estimate the parameters by making measurements on physical systems living on the spacetime manifold .",
    "there has recently been some promising work in this direction  @xcite , focusing on quantum probes consisting of scalar fields in gaussian states .",
    "here we present a general formalism for relativistic quantum metrology , using arbitrary fields and states . in so doing ,",
    "we address several related issues , which have , we believe , not previously received enough attention in this context . ensuring that quantum observables in different spacetimes measure  the same \" physical parameter is nontrivial .",
    "if the spacetimes differ by a global perturbation , the positions of measurement devices therein might correspondingly differ , further complicating the issue ; more generally , spacetime points in two such spacetimes can not unambiguously be identified with each other .",
    "care must also be taken to ensure cordinate invariance .",
    "fortunately , a framework exists for comparing quantum observables in perturbed , classical spacetimes in a cordinate - independent manner  @xcite .",
    "this locally covariant framework , which was developed in the context of algebraic quantum field theory , serves as our starting point .",
    "as the current work is geared more towards physical experiments than most literature invoking algebraic quantum field theory , it is worth a comment .",
    "the aim of algebraic quantum field theory is to put quantum field theory on rigorous mathematical footing , while the aim of what might be termed pragmatic quantum field theory is to make experimental predictions  @xcite .",
    "strides toward connecting the two have been made recently  @xcite , and this progress makes the current work .",

    "we consider such povms given by a positive - operator - valued density @xmath25 that satisfies the completeness property @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the identity operator .",
    "the outcomes of a particular measurement follow a probability distribution @xmath28 conditional on the parameter  @xmath18 .",
    "the probability distribution for the outcomes @xmath23 can be calculated as @xmath29    the problem of estimating the parameter  @xmath18 is essentially that of choosing a value @xmath30 to make a good estimate of @xmath18 by considering the observed @xmath23 in relation to the known probability distributions @xmath31 .",
    "a common example is the maximum likelihood estimator , which is the choice of @xmath30 that retrospectively maximizes the probability of the observed measurement outcomes .",
    "the variance of an unbiased estimate of the parameter  @xmath18 , based on the distribution of measurement outcomes to be observed , is bounded by the classical cramr - rao lower bound  @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the classical fisher information for the measurement , given by @xmath34 in this paper we consider the special case where @xmath35 is differentiable at @xmath36 , with differential generated by the self - adjoint operator @xmath37 as expressed by @xmath38\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] informally , we write @xmath39 it can then be shown that for any povm , the classical fisher information satisfies @xmath40  @xcite , where @xmath41 is the quantum variance of the generator @xmath37 ; moreover , there is a povm that saturates this bound when @xmath42 is pure  @xcite .",
    "applying this bound to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftheta ] ) yields the quantum cramr - rao lower bound  @xcite , @xmath43 one can now easily construct examples by simply identifying parameters and their corresponding generators .",
    "for example , since the hamiltonian is the generator of time translations , this gives the time - energy uncertainty relation  ( [ teur ] ) presented in the introduction .",
    "since the momentum operator generates displacements , using it as the generator gives the parameter - based version of the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "another important example is provided by the number operator and phase , which is the basis of heisenberg - limited phase estimation  @xcite .",
    "we employ the  locally covariant \" formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime as developed by brunetti , fredenhagen , and verch  @xcite .",
    "the approach has been used to develop a notion of  identical physics \" over different spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "a key result is a method for calculating how quantum observables respond to local changes in the background spacetime .",
    "say we believe some particular region of the universe to be well described by a metric @xmath44 that depends on a parameter  @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath45 is assumed to parameterize a compactly supported perturbation , the locally covariant approach can be used to calculate how any observable @xmath46 responds to such a change .",
    "the response is evaluated as the rate of change of the observable with respect to the parameter . as we noted in the introduction , this is just what we need to calculate the quantum cramr - rao lower bound .",
    "we emphasize , however , that only compactly supported perturbations in spacetime are considered by @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this restriction is similar to that for restricting the domain of distributions to test functions and ensures that relevant quantities are well defined .",
    "we consider how to approach more general perturbations in sec .",
    "[ sec : compact ] .",
    "the locally covariant approach is formulated in a category - theory framework .",

    "the additional property of global hyperbolicity is a restriction on the causal structure on the manifold .",
    "it removes the possibility of closed time - like curves and ensures the spacetime can be foliated into cauchy surfaces .",

    "the interpretation of this is as follows : fields are prepared in @xmath50 , they then scatter off an intermediate region ( the compact subset of geometric assumption  3 ) and are measured in @xmath67 ; @xmath45 controls a localized perturbation within this region , and eq .",

    "for example , for the electromagnetic field , which we consider in section  [ sec : gw ] , the weyl algebra of the klein - gordon field is simply replaced by the weyl algebra of gauge - equivalence classes of the vector potential . then by theorem  3.2.9 in @xcite , the functional derivative with respect to the perturbed metric of an operator @xmath73 is again given by the commutator with the stress - energy tensor , as in eq .",
    "( [ remarkc43 ] ) .",
    "due to the dual nature of operators and states , a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ mainbfvresult ] ) is that we can write @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a density operator in the gelfand - neimark - segal  @xcite representation of the algebra on @xmath55 after the action of @xmath80 , the unitary in the hilbert - space representation corresponding to the relative cauchy evolution ( more precisely to a unit - preserving autormorphism on the algebra of observables , called @xmath81 in the app .",
    "[ sec : categorytheory ] ) .",
    "then , noting the equivalence of eq .",
    "( [ sderiv ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ inf_change_rho ] ) , we obtain  @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the estimator for the perturbation parameter .",
    "a limitation of the quantum cramr - rao bound  ( [ eq : qcrb ] ) is that the spacetime perturbation is restricted to compact support , whereas physically interesting perturbations are typically not so restricted .",
    "for example , variation in the mass of the earth would vary the metric at unbounded distances away .",
    "therefore we need to consider how to approximate global perturbations compactly .",
    "our approach is to develop the intuitive notion that to a sufficiently localized probe , a global perturbation should be indistinguishable from a compact perturbation . consider a probe whose stress - energy is confined to a compact region , say , by a cavity , and is switched on and off at finite times .",
    "now let @xmath18 denote the spacetime parameter of interest and @xmath84 its fiducial value .",
    "we can choose a smooth `` bump '' function , @xmath85 , with @xmath86 on the support of the probe s mean stress - energy and @xmath87 outside a neighborhood of this support .",
    "writing the metric as @xmath88 , we can replace it by @xmath89 . with the expectation that the measurement is insensitive to the difference between these two metrics , @xmath90 where @xmath30 is the estimator for @xmath18 and @xmath91",
    "intuitively , the bump - function modification of the previous paragraph works if we can treat the probe state s contribution to first and second moments of @xmath92 as a compactly supported change to the contributions from a reference state ( e.g. , vacuum ) , these changes being turned on and off by an external apparatus that is involved only classically and independent of the parameter . for global perturbations ,",
    "however , the reference state can depend on the parameter and on boundary effects from arbitrary choices made in the bump function .",
    "we expect reference - state contributions to @xmath93 to be present generally .",
    "they can not be confined to the support of the field s mean stress - energy , which we have assumed is confined within the region where @xmath86 .",
    "the reference - state contributions thus depend on the bump function , since the shape of a test function can significantly alter the size of the reference - state contributions  @xcite . to get around this problem , we assume that the probe states have sufficiently large mean stress - energy that its contribution to the variance of @xmath94 dominates the reference - state contributions , which can then be neglected .",
    "this clearly implies some additional constraint on the bump function , but once this strategy is implemented , we expect variance calculations based on the bump - function modification to be independent of the details of the bump function and hence to determine the parameter uncertainty for the original global metric perturbation . thus , in the following , when we use a bump function to make the metric perturbation compact , we drop the higher - order reference - state contributions",
    ".    for example , consider a flat fiducial spacetime where the reference state is the free - field vacuum .",
    "we consider such a situation in sec .",
    "[ sec : gw ] , where we analyze the detection of a linearized gravitational wave using the electromagnetic field as a probe .",
    "the calculation of @xmath93 in this case includes vacuum expectation factors via normal ordering and wick s theorem throughout the relevant region .",
    "normal ordering and the integral involved in calculating @xmath92 average away the vacuum contributions from field modes that vary rapidly across the support of the mean electromagnetic field .",
    "the remaining vacuum contributions to @xmath93 express the change of vacuum noise in field modes that are matched to the size of the support of the mean field ; these are physical contributions in that the redistribution of vacuum noise could be used to sense the effect of the perturbation on the field .",
    "interesting though this effect is , however , it is nothing like the current methods for detecting a gravitational wave using the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , in sec .  [",
    "sec : gw ] , we assume that the probe states have a sufficiently large mean electromagnetic field that the mean field s contribution to the variance of @xmath94 dominates the contribution of vacuum or other , say , squeezed fluctuations that are independent of the size of the mean field .",
    "we then neglect all such mean - field - independent contributions .",
    "we expect the strategy outlined above also to apply to general curved backgrounds . for any free field in a ( globally hyperbolic )",
    "spacetime , there exists a mean - field - zero reference state , called a hadamard state , characterized by well - defined two - point correlators  @xcite .",
    "such a reference state allows us to perform normal ordering via the point - splitting approach .",
    "a corresponding stress - energy tensor can then be constructed , with a well - defined expectation value  @xcite , which is unique up to terms which cancel in the commutator  ( [ mainbfvresult ] ) ) and in the variance ( and is thus sufficient for our purposes ) . moreover , while the hadamard reference state might not be unique , its contribution to the relevant variance is mean - field independent and thus negligible by assumption .",
    "the formulation given so far is generally covariant , but a complication arises when the parameter of interest is expressed in a cordinate - dependent way , particularly when estimating global parameters .",
    "this situation arises for example when estimating the invariant mass of a black hole , where there are a number of different standard cordinate systems to choose from . while in general , cordinate dependence of this sort can lead to different expressions for the relevant variances , given our assumptions on reference and probe states and choices of bump functions , we find that the differences typically become negligible , as we now illustrate in the example of @xmath94 calculated in schwarzschild cordinates , as compared to @xmath94 calculated in isotropic cordinates .",
    "the fiducial metric in schwarzschild cordinates is @xmath95 and in isotropic cordinates it is @xmath96 by our prescription for approximating a global perturbation by a compact perturbation , we add to every instance of the fiducial mass @xmath97 a bump function of the form @xmath98 or @xmath99 : @xmath100/2\\rho}{1+[m_0+(m - m_0)\\chi/2\\rho]}\\right)^{\\!2 } dt^2 + \\biggl(1+\\frac{m_0+(m - m_0)\\chi}{2\\rho}\\biggr)^{\\!4}(d\\rho^2+\\rho^2d\\omega^2)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the resulting metrics @xmath101 and @xmath102 are not related by a cordinate transformation and thus are no longer physically equivalent .",
    "this reflects the fact that there is no unique way to approximate a global perturbation with a compact perturbation .",
    "our particular choice depends on our initial cordinates , out of convenience . these metrics are , however , locally related by a cordinate transformation on a patch restricted to and generally within the region where @xmath103",
    ". therein , both metrics are locally indistinguishable from that of a black hole with mass @xmath104 and are related by the @xmath104-dependent cordinate transformation that relates schwarzschild and isotropic cordinates .    now letting @xmath105 for simplicity ,",
    "consider the ( normally ordered ) expectation value of @xmath94 with respect to a probe state , where the expectation value of the stress - energy is assumed to be confined to a region  @xmath106 in which @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath107 and @xmath86 for @xmath108 .",

    "it should come as no surprise , then , that @xmath114 and @xmath115 appear to be unequal : @xmath116 this appearance is deceptive , however , as we see from @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the surface element induced on the boundary @xmath119 of @xmath106 and @xmath120 is the corresponding surface normal . since @xmath121 vanishes on @xmath119 and assuming @xmath122 ( as required for a properly defined stress - energy tensor @xcite ) , which implies that the left - hand side of eq .",
