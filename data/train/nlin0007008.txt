    "the statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium processes has been the subject of renewed attention .",

    "these observations have motivated the theoretical study of low - dimensional model systems where one can obtain quantitative information about nonequilibrium processes in terms of the chaotic properties of the microscopic dynamics of the systems .    in this context , several relationships have been established between transport properties such as diffusion or viscosity and characteristic quantities of chaos such as lyapunov exponents , kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy per unit time , and fractal dimensions @xcite .",
    "these relationships have been obtained for two different types of dynamical systems : ( a ) deterministic systems with gaussian thermostats and , ( b ) open hamiltonian systems with absorbing boundaries .    in the deterministic systems with gaussian thermostats @xcite , the forces ruling the motion of the particles",

    ", formulae have been obtained for the viscosity of an externally sheared fluid @xcite and also for the diffusion of a gaussian - thermostated lorentz gas @xcite . in this last case ,",
    "the formula relating the diffusion coefficient to the sum of the lyapunov exponents was also rigorously proved @xcite . in the thermostated lorentz gas ,",
    "the kinetic energy is constant ( instead of the total energy ) and the phase space of the flow has thus the dimension three .",
    "the lyapunov exponents of this system are @xmath0 with @xmath1 for a nonvanishing field force @xmath2 . in the three - dimensional phase space",

    "the information dimension of the fractal attractor approaches the phase - space dimension in a way controlled by the diffusion coefficient , which is the basis of this kind of formulae .",
    "very similar formulae have been obtained for open hamiltonian systems with absorbing boundaries @xcite .",
    "such boundaries are naturally introduced in systems of scattering type in which particles or trajectories undergo transient collisions before escaping out of a phase - space region of varying geometry .",
    "the absorbing boundaries have the effect of driving the system out of equilibrium without a modification of the forces which can remain hamiltonian , i.e. , time - reversal symmetric and also volume preserving .",
    "the escape of trajectories leads to the formation of a _ fractal repeller _ , described by a invariant gibbs measure which is fractal in both the unstable and the stable directions .",
    "for such systems , the rate of escape is given as the difference between the sum of positive lyapunov exponents and the ks entropy @xcite , calculated with respect to the invariant gibbs measure on the repeller .",
    "this escape - rate formula was rigorously proved for anosov maps with rectangular holes @xcite . for the conservative lorentz gas with absorbing boundaries separated by a distance @xmath11 , the lyapunov exponents are @xmath12 and",
    "the diffusion coefficient has been obtained by the following formulae @xcite where the quantities are evaluated for the fractal repeller @xmath13 : @xmath14 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\lim_{l\\to \\infty } \\left(\\frac{l}{\\pi}\\right)^2 \\",

    "this information codimension can be replaced by the partial hausdorff codimension @xmath16 of the fractal repeller in the limit @xmath17 @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaspard90 ] ) , the fractal repeller fills the phase space in the limit where the absorbing boundaries are sent to infinity . the way the dimension of the fractal repeller approaches the phase - space dimension is controlled by the diffusion coefficient , and leads to the relationship between the transport coefficient and the codimension . the formula ( [ eq : gaspard90 ] )",
    "has been generalized to all the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the similarities between formulae ( [ eq : evans90b ] ) and ( [ eq : gaspard90 ] ) have been discussed for several years @xcite . in particular , a generalization of these formulae in the presence of both an external field and absorbing boundaries was obtained @xcite . however , each of the two formulae depends very much on the type of invariant set , an attractor or a repeller , and on the invariant measure , srb or gibbs , in terms of which they are derived .",
    "thus , since the corresponding measures and fractal structures are so different in the two cases , it has not yet been possible to provide satisfying reasons why the formulae are so similar .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to introduce a unifying approach which transcends the aforementioned differences and in which a third and new formula can be derived which expresses the diffusion coefficient in terms of the positive lyapunov exponent of the system and the hausdorff dimension of a fractal curve that describes a generalized hydrodynamic mode of the diffusion process .",
    "this hausdorff dimension is not , therefore , the dimension of an attractor or a repeller .",
    "the novelty of the present unifying approach is that we consider an abstract fractal curve directly associated with the hydrodynamic modes of relaxation toward a stationary state such as the equilibrium state .",
    "these hydrodynamic modes exist whether the system is thermostated or not , on the condition that its spatial extension is large compared with characteristic microscopic lengths , in order to sustain a process of transport by diffusion .",
    "we suppose that the time evolution of the concentration of tracer particles can be decomposed by a spatial fourier transform into modes characterized by a wavenumber @xmath18 or , equivalently , a wavelength @xmath19 .",
    "each mode describes the inhomogeneities of concentration having this specified spatial periodicity and the time evolution of a non - periodic concentration is obtained by superposition of all the modes .",
    "each mode has an exponential relaxation rate . for a deterministic dynamical system",
    ", these hydrodynamic modes can be defined in analogy with the conditionally invariant measures @xcite by compensating the exponential decay of the mode amplitude with an appropriate renormalization at each time step . in the present context , the conditionally invariant measures defining the hydrodynamic modes are complex because of the fourier transform .",
    "a theory of these hydrodynamic modes has been described elsewhere @xcite , where these conditionally invariant measures are obtained as the eigendistributions of a perron - frobenius operator of the dynamical system .",
    "the main result we have to keep in mind here is that these complex measures are singular with respect to the lebesgue measure so that they do not have density functions .",
    "instead , they have cumulative functions defined by the measure of a variable set in phase space .",
    "these cumulative functions are complex , continuous and nondifferentiable .",
    "when plotted in the complex plane , they depict fractal curves of von koch s type @xcite with hausdorff dimensions between one and two .",
    "a recent work by the present authors @xcite has showed that the singular character of the hydrodynamic modes accounts for the entropy production of irreversible thermodynamics .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall show that the hausdorff dimension of the fractal curves associated with the hydrodynamic modes is controlled by the diffusion coefficient , which leads to a new relationship between transport and chaos .",
    "we shall here prove our result for a whole class of multi - baker maps .",
    "this may appear restrictive but several important results were first proved for the multi - baker before being extended to more general chaotic systems .",
    "in particular , let us mention that the multi - baker models have been used for the study of the nonequilibrium steady states and the entropy production @xcite .",
    "the multi - baker models have the advantage of being exactly solvable so that they are therefore appropriate for the intensive studies of different nonequilibrium properties .",
    "many of their properties are known in detail @xcite .",

    "the simplest examples of reversible dynamical systems with diffusive properties are based upon simple stochastic processes .",
    "the most commonly studied is the discrete symmetric dyadic random walk where independent particles are allowed to move on the sites of a one - dimensional discrete lattice and the time evolution is determined by the condition that the probability is the same for a particle to move to the nearest neighboring site , on the right or left @xcite .    in order to study this process as one with a phase - space dynamics , we consider the set of all the possible infinite ( both in the past and future ) trajectories of such particles .",
    "it consists of sequences @xmath20 of integers @xmath21 with the restriction that the difference between the integers at successive time steps is always equal to plus or minus one , i.e. @xmath22 @xmath23 the stochastic time evolution is thus replaced by the shift operator on those sequences , @xmath24 with @xmath25    alternatively , a convenient representation of phase space is to consider binary sequences of zeros and ones labeling respectively hops to the left and right . a trajectory of the random walker",
