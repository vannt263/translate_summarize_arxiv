    "these atoms are evaporatively cooled to quantum degeneracy resulting in a final number of condensed atoms between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "to carry out experiments in a disordered lattice configuration we use two optical dipole potentials , a 1d lattice and the disordered potential .",
    "both are derived from a ti : sa laser operating at a wavelength of @xmath5  nm .",
    "acousto - optic modulators are used to control the intensity of each dipole potential and optical fibres are employed to deliver the light beams to the experiment .",
    "the optical lattice is created by retro - reflection of a laser beam along the axial direction of the magnetic trap .",
    "the depth of the optical lattice is typically set to 6.5  @xmath6 .",
    "the recoil energy @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the atomic mass and @xmath9 corresponds to the wave number of the optical lattice .",
    "the detection system is used to image the axial position of the atomic cloud as well as the the beam waist .",
    "this allows for precise positioning of the beam waist with respect to the atomic sample .",
    "the disorder potential is created by illuminating a randomly structured chrome substrate with a laser beam .",
    "the partially transmitting substrate is imaged onto the atomic sample from a direction orthogonal to the optical lattice . due to the resolution of the imaging system , the minimal structure size of the dipole potential",
    "is limited to a few microns .",
    "figure  [ speckle ] shows an image of the disorder potential at the position of the atomic cloud .",
    "we define the depth of the disorder potential @xmath10 as twice the standard deviation of the dipole potential , analogously to @xcite .",
    "figure [ correlation ] shows the calculated auto correlation function    @xmath11    for a typical realization of the disordered potential . in ( [ autocorrelation ] )",
    "the brackets denote the average over position and @xmath12 represents the disordered potential .",
    "figure [ correlation ] shows that the correlation length of the potential decays on a typical length scale of @xmath13 .",
    "after the production of the bec our experiments are performed as follows .",
    "the optical lattice is ramped to its final depth within 60  ms .",
    "subsequently the disorder potential is increased to its final depth within another 60  ms followed by a hold time of 20  ms .",
    "finally all potentials are switched off and the atomic density distribution is measured after 20  ms of free expansion using absorption imaging .    in the expanded atomic density distributions we observe significant irregular modulations which depend on the strength of the disordered potential . to quantify these modulations we fit the central peak of the expanded lattice gas with an inverted parabolic distribution and calculate the standard deviation @xmath14 of the measured density profile from this fit .",
    "figure [ res_vs_dis ] shows the dependence of the standard deviation on the depth of the disordered potential .",
    "clearly the deviation from the unperturbed parabolic distribution grows with increased disorder strength .     of the observed axial density distribution from an inverted parabola after 20  ms of free expansion , depending on the disorder strength .",
    "the red line is a linear fit to the data which serves as a guide to the eye.,width=325 ]    to further investigate the expansion of the disordered lattice gas we extract the axial size of the central momentum peak from the fits of the density with an inverted parabolic distribution .",

    "the lines correspond to a theoretical prediction ( see text ) .",
    "the lattice depth is 6.5  @xmath6 and the disorder has a depth of 0.1  @xmath6.,width=325 ]    the red curve shows the theoretical prediction based on the thomas - fermi approximation and subsequent self - similar expansion @xcite for a confinement in the magnetic trap only .",
    "the blue curve shows an estimate for the expansion of a lattice gas in the absence of disorder .",
    "it is obtained by using the increased axial size of the cloud due to the presence of the optical lattice @xcite as a starting point for the self similar expansion .",
    "the addition of the disorder potential yields a more surprising result . despite its very small potential depth , the additional axial confinement due to the disorder potential leads to a significant increase of the axial size after expansion .",
    "the theoretical analysis below shows that the disordered potential induces strong deviations of the density profile from the parabolic envelope .",
    "therefore significant deviations from the self similar expansion are expected for disordered gases . according to figure [ res_vs_dis ]",
    "these deviations produce irregular density modulations and can lead to pronounced changes in the widths of the expanded clouds .",
    "the explicit form of the expanded density distribution however depends strongly on the exact realization of the disordered potential .",
    "we have used a 3d numerical simulation to check the expansion of the disordered gas in the absence of the optical lattice .",
    "depending on the disorder potential used , the simulation confirms the observed behavior qualitatively .      in the system considered here ,",
    "the disorder potential is imposed along one axis of the cloud .",
    "hence a 1d gross - pitaevskii equation is used to describe the basic properties of the system and to analyze parameter regimes where localization phenomena can be observed .",

    "the fraction of depleted atoms is less than 1% .",
    "the 1d gpe used in our simulations is given by    i_t= , [ gpe ]    where we have adopted harmonic oscillator units , i.e. @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 as energy , length and time units .",

    "this analysis shows that the effect of a slowly varying disorder potential applied to bose - einstein condensates in the lattice potential can be described within the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "the condensate density is modulated by the slowly varying disorder and consequently no anderson localization is present .",
    "these results thus bear similarity to the experiments performed in the absence of an optical lattice @xcite where a fragmentation of the bec is induced by the disorder potential .",
    "the above analysis suggests that it is necessary to introduce a disorder that changes on a length scale smaller than the healing length to enter a regime where localization effects can be observed . to overcome the experimental difficulties of imposing such a truly random potential",
    "the use of pseudorandom potentials has been suggested @xcite .",

    "the exponential tails of the ensemble density are a clear manifestation of anderson - like localization",

    "this is due to the fact that the interaction between atoms delocalize the condensate .",
    "the effect can be visualized by considering an effective potential .",
    "that is , once the solution @xmath46 of the stationary gpe is known , the equation can be considered as a schrdinger equation    -12+v_eff(x)_0(x)=_0(x ) ,    with the effective potential    v_eff(x)=+v_0 ^ 2(kx)+v_dis(x)+g|_0(x)|^2 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ loc ] the situation without the nonlinear term @xmath44 leads to the observation of anderson - like localization",
    ". however , when this term is present the effective potential loses its disordered nature due to a screening effect .",
    "figure  [ screen ] shows the potentials @xmath20 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is apparent that in the effective potential the disorder is smoothed and screened . for typical experimental parameters the term @xmath44 dominates over @xmath20 and consequently the randomness necessary for localization",
    "is lost .",
    "hence a fine scale disorder alone is not sufficient to induce a non - trivial localization in the system .",
    "additional control of the interaction is necessary .",
    "this effect is due to the accumulation of atoms in the wells of the random potential . in these regions of high density",
    "the nonlinear term in the gpe effectively smoothes the potential modulations @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of this screening effect was recently given in @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the transition from a fully delocalized to a localized ground state of a bosonic lattice gas in two ways .",
    "first a range of interaction strengths @xmath44 were investigated numerically for a fixed depth of the additional lattices . in current experiments",
    "a variation of the interaction strength can be realized by varying the density @xmath48 of the sample or by using a feshbach resonance to change the coupling constant @xmath24 .",
    "our main aim was to investigate if suitable parameters for the experimental observation of localization can be obtained .",
    "secondly we have investigated the onset of localization as the disorder strength is increased in a weakly interacting bec .",
    "our calculations were performed in an experimentally accessible regime with a trap frequency of @xmath49  hz and a pseudorandom potential equivalent to the one used for fig .",
    "[ loc ] . for @xmath50",
    "one obtains anderson - like localization of the ground state wavefunction which is characterized by an exponential localization as shown in fig  [ loc ] .     while the depths of the additional lattices forming the pseudorandom potential are @xmath51 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath24 for the panels are : 0.5 ( top ) , 8 ( middle ) , 256 ( bottom ) . note the different scales in the panels.,width=325 ]    figure  [ b ] shows ground states within this potential for three values of the interaction parameter . as @xmath24 is increased the number of localization centers grows and for large values of @xmath24 they overlap considerably .",
    "this behavior suggests that the condensate wavefunction becomes a combination of these localized states due to nonlinear interactions .",
    "when @xmath24 is of the order of 500 one can no longer distinguish individual localized states and the clear signature of non - trivial localization vanishes .",
    "the case of @xmath52 shown in fig .  [ b ] is equivalent to a 3d experimental realization with trap frequencies of @xmath53  hz and @xmath54  hz and @xmath55 atoms .",

    "[ b ] . within the scope of our simulation",
    "the amplitude of the pseudorandom potential has to be sufficiently big to ensure that the localization length is smaller than the size of the system .",
    "this analysis clearly shows two distinct features of localization .",
    "first , the localization length strongly depends on the depth of the superlattice .",
    "even a very small added pseudorandom potentials leads to localization in small localization sites .",
    "this confirms the expected non - perturbative character of localization .",

    "the superfluid fraction is obtained by calculating the response of the condensed sample to twisted boundary conditions @xcite . within this model",

    "it is important to note that this method only represents one possible definition of superfluidity @xcite . within the gpe framework ,",

    "the width of the envelope of the zero - momentum peak is strikingly similar for all realizations .",
    "the results represent a clear distinction from the classical case , where the width of the expanded cloud depends strongly on the interaction parameter @xmath24 .",
