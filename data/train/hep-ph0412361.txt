    "a successful way of understanding the properties of the mesons is to approximate the gluon exchanges between the quark and the antiquark by a string ( the qcd string ) , characterized by its energy density , or tension .",
    "the relativistic flux tube model ( rftm ) is a phenomenological model based on this picture @xcite .",
    "more recently , the rotating string model ( rsm ) has been derived from the nambu - goto lagrangian as an effective model which also describes a meson as a quark and an antiquark linked by a string @xcite .",
    "the physical content of these models is very similar , and it has been shown that they are actually classically equivalent once the auxiliary fields appearing in the rsm are completely eliminated @xcite . a rather good description of the experimental meson spectrum can be obtained with the original rftm supplemented by a coulomb term @xcite .",
    "but unfortunately , a strong coupling constant larger than what it is expected from experimental analysis and lattice simulations must be considered .",
    "the necessity of finding new contributions arising from neglected physical mechanisms is thus clear .",
    "recently , a quark self energy ( qse ) contribution was introduced , which is due to the color magnetic moment of the quark propagating through the vacuum @xcite .",
    "the qse brings a negative contribution to the hadron masses , and seems to be an interesting way of reproducing the experimental data with a smaller coulomb term .",
    "our purpose here is to study the influence of the qse on the meson masses , especially using the rftm .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sec .",
    "[ sec : rs_rft ] is a short presentation of both classical rftm and rsm , where we also underline their classical equivalence .",

    "originally , the rftm was built on phenomenological arguments .",
