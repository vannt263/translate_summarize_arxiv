    "l n trefethen @xcite presented ten problems used in teaching numerical analysis at oxford university .",
    "the answer to each problem was a real number , and readers were set the challenge of computing 10 significant digits of the answer to each problem , with the additional incentive of $ 100 for the best entrant . in the event ,",
    "some 94 teams from 25 nations submitted solutions , and twenty of these teams achieved a perfect score .",
    "a donor , w j browning , kindly provided additional funds so that all 20 teams achieving a perfect score could be awarded the $ 100 prize !    as is so often the case , the mathematics revealed by the different approaches to the solutions was at least as interesting as the original problems , and indeed spawned a book _ the siam 100digit challenge : a study in high - accuracy numerical computing , _ @xcite , which is usefully and engagingly described in j borwein s review @xcite . indeed , the authors of the book responded by providing not 10 , but 10,000-digit solutions to all the problems but one , for which `` only '' several hundred digits are available .",
    "borwein s personal favourite , and the catalyst for the calculation reported here , is problem number 10 : _ a particle at the centre of a @xmath0 rectangle undergoes brownian motion ( i.e. , 2-d random walk with infinitesimal step lengths ) till it hits the boundary . what is the probability that it hits at one of the ends rather than at one of the sides ? _    remarkably , it turns out @xcite that a closed form solution to this question can be found , _ via _ the theory of elliptic functions and invoking some results of ramanujan on singular moduli .",
    "the result is @xmath1 in discussion with nathan clisby , the question as to the corresponding problem where brownian motion is replaced by the scaling limit of a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) arose .",
    "the rest of this paper addresses our answer to this question .",
    "in fact , we prefer to address the equivalent question , which is the ratio of the probability that the walk hits the end to the probability that it hits a side .",
    "this is just @xmath2 which has the numerical value @xmath3 for the random walk case .",
    "a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) of length @xmath4 on a periodic graph or lattice @xmath5 is a sequence of distinct vertices @xmath6 in @xmath5 such that each vertex is a nearest neighbour of its predecessor . in figure",
    "[ fig : saw ] a short saw on the square lattice is shown ,        while in figure  [ fig:23d ] a rather long walk of @xmath7 steps is shown ( generated by a monte carlo algorithm @xcite ) .",
    "steps on the square lattice  courtesy of nathan clisby.,width=188 ]    one of the most important questions one asks about saws is : how many saws are there of length @xmath8 ( typically defined up to translations ) denoted @xmath9 ? frequently one rather considers the associated generating function @xmath10 for saws on a lattice it is straightforward to show that @xmath9 grows exponentially with @xmath4 @xcite , so that @xmath11 where @xmath12 depends on the lattice , and determines the radius of convergence of the generating function @xmath13 .",
    "another important question , and central to our investigation , is the existence and nature of the _ scaling limit _ of saws , described in the next section .",
    "an intuitive grasp of this concept can be gained by looking at the two figures above . in the first",
    ", the effect of the lattice is clear . in the second",
    ", there is no obvious lattice , and indeed no way to tell that this is not a curve in the continuum .",
    "we formalise this notion as follows : consider a smooth ( enough ) closed domain @xmath14 on an underlying square grid , with grid spacing @xmath15 as shown in figure [ fig : scal - lim ] .",
    "denote by @xmath16 that portion of the grid contained in @xmath17 take two distinct points on the boundary of @xmath18 labelled @xmath19 and @xmath20 now take the nearest lattice vertex to @xmath21 and label it @xmath22 and similarly let @xmath23 be the label of the nearest lattice vertex to point @xmath20 consider the set of saws @xmath24 on the finite domain @xmath16 from @xmath25 to @xmath26 recall that @xmath27 sets the scale of the grid .",
    "now let @xmath28 be the length of a walk @xmath29 and weight the walk by @xmath30 the reason for this is that the walks are of different lengths , making the uniform measure not particularly natural .",
    "( there is also a normalising factor , which for simplicity we ignore ) .",
    "[ fig : scal - lim ]    ( 0.6,0.6 ) grid ( 8.4,7.4 ) ; ( a ) at ( 1.1,5.6 ) ; ( adelta ) at ( 1,5 ) ; ( b ) at ( 7.9,3.3 ) ; ( bdelta ) at ( 7,3 ) ; ( a ) node [ left=2pt ] @xmath19 [ fill ] circle ( 2pt ) ; ( adelta ) node [ below right ] @xmath31 [ fill ] circle ( 2pt ) ; ( b ) node [ right=2pt ] @xmath32 [ fill ] circle ( 2pt ) ; ( bdelta ) node [ below left ] @xmath33 [ fill ] circle ( 2pt ) ; plot coordinates ( 0.8 , 4.5 ) ( a ) ( 2.3,6.5 ) ( 3.8,6.9 ) ( 5,7.2 ) ( 6,7 ) ( 7,6.3 ) ( 7.7,5 ) ( b ) ( 7.4,2 ) ( 5.9,0.9 ) ( 3.8,0.8 ) ( 2,1.8 ) ( 1.5,3 ) ; ( adelta )  + + ( 1,0 )  + + ( 0,-1 )  + + ( 1,0 )  + + ( 0,-1 )  + + ( -1,0 )  + + ( 0,-1 )  + + ( 2,0 )  + + ( 0,4 )  + + ( 1,0 )  + + ( 0,-2 )  + + ( 1,0 )  + + ( 0,-1 )  ( bdelta ) ; ( 4.5,0 ) node @xmath18 ;    as we let @xmath34 we expect the behaviour of the walk to depend on the value of @xmath35 for @xmath36 it is possible to prove that @xmath37 goes to a straight line as @xmath38 ( strictly speaking it converges in distribution to a straight line , with fluctuations o@xmath39 ) for @xmath40 it is expected that @xmath37 becomes ( again , in distribution ) space - filling as @xmath38 but at @xmath41 it is _ conjectured _ that @xmath37 becomes ( in distribution ) a random continuous curve , and is conformally invariant .",
    "this describes the scaling limit .",
    "if this conjecture is correct , a second , pivotal , conjecture by lawler , schramm and werner @xcite is that this random curve converges to @xmath42 ( described below ) from @xmath19 to @xmath32 in the domain @xmath17      for an approachable discussion of sle@xmath43 see chapter 15 of @xcite .",
    "here we give a very minimal outline .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the upper half - plane .",
    "consider a path @xmath45 starting at the boundary and finishing at an internal vertex .",
    "then @xmath46 is the complement of this path , and is a slit upper half - plane .",
    "it follows from the riemann mapping theorem that it can be conformally mapped to the upper half - plane .",
    "lwner @xcite discovered that by specifying the map so that it approaches the identity at infinity , the conformal map so described ( actually a family of maps , appropriate to each point on the curve ) satisfies a simple differential equation , called the lwner equation .",
    "the mapping can alternatively be defined by a real function .",
    "this observation led schramm to apply the lwner equation to a conformally invariant measure for planar curves .",
    "that is to say , the lwner equation generates a set of conformal maps , driven by a continuous real - valued function .",
    "schramm s profound insight was to use brownian motion @xmath47 as the driving function .",
    "so let @xmath48 @xmath49 be standard brownian motion on @xmath50 and let @xmath51 be a real parameter .",
    "then sle@xmath52 is the family of conformal maps @xmath53 defined by the lwner equation @xmath54 for @xmath55 the domain of @xmath56 , which is the set of initial conditions @xmath57 for which the above differential equation still has a solution at time @xmath58 , equals the half - plane minus a simple curve .",
    "the curve starts at the origin and can be shown to go to @xmath59 .",
    "this is called _ chordal _ sle@xmath52 as it describes paths growing from the boundary point @xmath60 and ending at the boundary point @xmath59 .",
    "larger values of @xmath51 lead to more complicated behaviour .",
    "for a general simply connected domain @xmath61 , @xmath62 between two boundary points is just defined by taking the image of @xmath62 in the half - plane using a conformal map that takes the half - plane to @xmath63 and @xmath60 and @xmath59 to the two prescribed boundary points .",
    "it is conjectured , and widely believed , that the scaling limit of the saw between two fixed points is conformally invariant .",
    "lawler , schramm and werner @xcite showed that this conformal invariance and the so called restriction property for the saw imply that the scaling limit of the saw is described by @xmath42 .",
    "note that this only describes the saw in @xmath61 between two boundary points .",
    "if we want to describe the saw which starts at a fixed point on the boundary but can end anywhere on the boundary , then we need to know the distribution of this random endpoint .",
    "we discuss this distribution in the following section .",
    "hopefully this rather vague description will convey the flavour of this exciting and powerful development in studying not just two - dimensional saws , but a variety of other processes , such as percolation , the random cluster model , and the ising model .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for greater detail of both sle and these applications .",
    "let @xmath61 be a bounded , simply connected domain in the complex plane containing @xmath64 we are interested in paths in @xmath61 starting at @xmath60 and ending on the boundary of the domain",
    ". initially we will consider random walks , later self - avoiding walks .",
    "as described above in the description of the scaling limit , we can discretize the space with a lattice of lattice spacing @xmath65 in both the random walk case and the saw case we are interested in the scaling limit as @xmath38 for random walks the scaling limit is brownian motion , stopping when it hits the boundary of @xmath66 the distribution of the end - point is harmonic measure . if the domain boundary is piecewise smooth , then harmonic measure is absolutely continuous with respect to arc length along the boundary @xcite .",
    "let @xmath67 denote the density with respect to arc length ( often called the poisson kernel ) .",
    "if @xmath68 is a conformal map on @xmath61 that fixes the origin , and such that the boundary of @xmath69 is also piecewise smooth , then the conformal invariance of brownian motion implies that the density for harmonic measure on the boundary of @xmath69 is related to the boundary of @xmath61 by @xmath70 in the case of the saw , lawler schramm and werner @xcite predicted that the corresponding density of the probability measure @xmath71 transforms under conformal maps as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and the constant @xmath74 is required to ensure that @xmath75 is a probability density .",
    "if one starts the random walk or the saw at the center of a disc , then the hitting density on the circle will be uniform .",
    "so the above equations determine the hitting density for any simply connected domain .",
    "simulations in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite provide strong support for the conjectured behaviour .",
    "( [ cisaw ] ) is correct for domains whose boundary consists only of vertical and horizontal line segments . for general domains",
    "there is a lattice effect that persists in the scaling limit that produces a factor that depends on the angle of the tangent to the boundary that must be included @xcite . )",
    "the solution of the original problem for random walks by conformal maps is described in @xcite , where a conformal map from the unit disc to an @xmath76 rectangle is given by the schwarz - christoffel formula .",
    "our approach also uses conformal maps , but we instead use a map between the upper half - plane and a rectangle , where the mapping is again given by a schwarz - christoffel transformation . for @xmath77 let @xmath78 @xmath79 is a schwarz - christoffel transformation that maps the upper half plane to a rectangle .",
    "the rectangle has one edge along the real axis and @xmath60 is a midpoint of this side .",
    "so the corners can be written as @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 are the length of the horizontal and vertical edges , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath83    so @xmath84 we note that @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . by dilation invariance",
    "we only need concern ourselves with the aspect ratio @xmath87 so given an aspect ratio @xmath88 , we have to find @xmath89 such that    @xmath90    setting @xmath91 then @xmath74 can be written @xmath92 therefore @xmath93 now the nome @xmath94 is defined by @xmath95 so @xmath96 and @xmath97 then we have @xmath98 so @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the jacobi theta function .",
    "evaluating this in one s favourite algebraic package gives the required value of @xmath89 for any @xmath101 instantly .",
    "alternatively , we note that for an aspect ratio of 10 , as posed in the original problem , @xmath89 is very close to 1 .",
    "we can achieve very high accuracy by expanding the ratio of the above integrals around @xmath102 from the taylor expansion of elliptic integrals , and find @xmath103 solving this numerically for @xmath104 gives @xmath105 to leading order one obtains @xmath106 which , for @xmath104 gives @xmath107 which is in error only in the 14th digit .",
    "going further , we can write @xmath108 which , for @xmath104 gives 19 significant digits",
    ".    the preimage of the center of the rectangle will be on the imaginary axis , so write it as @xmath109 to find @xmath110 in terms of @xmath111 consider rotating the rectangle by 180 degrees",
    ". this will correspond ( under@xmath112 ) to a conformal automorphism of the upper half plane , i.e. , a mbius transformation @xmath113 since the rotation interchanges opposite corners , @xmath114 will interchange @xmath115 and @xmath116 and it will interchange @xmath117 and @xmath89 . the rotation interchanges the midpoints of the horizontal edges of the rectangle , so @xmath114 interchanges @xmath60 and @xmath118 so @xmath119 the point @xmath120 should be fixed by @xmath121 giving @xmath122    for the random walk and the saw in the half plane starting at @xmath123 it follows from ( [ cisaw ] ) and ( [ cirw ] ) that the ( unnormalized ) hitting density along the real axis is @xmath124 .",
    "so letting @xmath125 denote the hitting density for a rectangle with the walk starting at the center , we have by ( [ cisaw ] ) and ( [ cirw ] ) , @xmath126    we require the ratio of the integral of @xmath71 along a vertical edge to the integral along a horizontal edge , @xmath127 by a change of variable , setting @xmath128 in the denominator and @xmath129 in the numerator , this becomes @xmath130 recall that @xmath131 so that the ratio of probabilities of a first hit on the vertical side to a first hit on the horizontal side , @xmath132 is @xmath133",
    "we first consider the random walk case , corresponding to @xmath134 the integrals in ( [ rat ] ) greatly simplify , giving @xmath135    it is straightforward to calculate the asymptotic expansion of both the numerator and denominator , and hence their ratio . in this way we find @xmath136 for @xmath104",
    "this evaluates to @xmath137 which is correct to 6 significant digits .    proceeding to the second - order term , we obtain @xmath138 for @xmath104 this evaluates to @xmath139 which is correct to 13 significant digits .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain further terms should one so wish .",
    "unfortunately for @xmath140 we can not evaluate the integrals exactly , but as for the random walk case , asymptotics provides us with sufficient accuracy . referring to equation",
    "( [ rat ] ) , and noting that @xmath89 is very close to 1 when the aspect ratio is 10 , the denominator integral can be accurately approximated by @xmath141    the numerator integral has a very narrow range of integration , so we can approximate the factor @xmath142 by 2 , the factor @xmath143 by @xmath144 and the factor @xmath145 by @xmath146 thus the numerator can be approximated by @xmath147 if we set @xmath148 , this becomes @xmath149^{({b}-1)/2}dt= \\frac{2^{-{b}-1}\\sqrt{\\pi}\\gamma\\left ( \\frac{1+{b}}{2}\\right ) } { \\gamma \\left ( 1+\\frac{{b}}{2}\\right ) } ( \\alpha-1)^{b}.\\ ] ]    combining the above results , and using the result derived above , @xmath150 we find , asymptotically @xmath151 for saw , @xmath152 and ( [ finas ] ) reduces to @xmath153 for @xmath104 this gives @xmath154    in order to get an estimate of the accuracy of this result , we calculated the relevant integrals numerically , which is quite straightforward in either maple or mathematica . in this way we found",
    "the more accurate estimate @xmath155    a rather elaborate calculation gives the next term in the asymptotic expansion of the aspect ratio as    @xmath156,\\ ] ] for @xmath157 where @xmath158 evaluating this for @xmath159 , we find @xmath160 which is in error by 2 in the @xmath161 significant digit , whereas the leading order term gives an estimate which is in error by 6 in the @xmath162 significant digit    we see that the corresponding ratio for the scaling limit of saws in a @xmath0 rectangle is some two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding result for brownian motion .",
    "this higher probability is intuitively what one might expect , as saws tend to move in a straight trajectory rather more than do random walks .",
