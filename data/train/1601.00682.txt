    "however , all of the four labs also host an alma source , either directly associated with the x - ray agn or within the extent of the ly  @xmath2 emission , which indicates the presence of luminous star formation ; see table  1 and 2 .    using eqn  1 to convert from @xmath32 to sfr ,",

    "2015 ) and , therefore , the x - ray detected labs do not appear to have significantly elevated sfrs when compared to the field ; see fig .",

    "interestingly , the two giant labs in our sample ( lab  2 ; lab  3 ) , with physical extents of @xmath7  100  kpc ( matsuda et  al . 2011 ) , do not host more luminous star formation than the two smaller alma - detected labs despite being an order of magnitude more luminous in ly  @xmath2 emission . to first order this suggests that star - formation activity has less of an affect on the production of the extended ly  @xmath2 emission in the giant labs than for the smaller labs .",
    "we can quantify the potential contribution to the ly  @xmath2 emission from photoionisation in labs by taking the same approach as geach et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) and calculate the ratio between the 200912    luminosity from star formation ( i.e. ,  the ultra - violet wavelengths where the photon energies are high enough to produce ly  @xmath2 through photoionisation ) and the ly  @xmath2 luminosity . in this calculation",

    "( 2009 ) , which provides a good characterisation of the composite sed of the x - ray detected labs in the ssa  22 protocluster .",
    "on the basis of this approach we find that the luminosity at 200912    due to star formation is always at least an order of magnitude higher than the ly  @xmath2 luminosity and can be responsible for producing the ly  @xmath2 luminosity with the following escape fractions of 200912    photons : @xmath3  5% ( lab  2 ) , @xmath3  3% ( lab  3 ) , @xmath3  0.3% ( lab  12 ) , and @xmath3  0.2% ( lab  14 ) . by comparison , the average escape fraction for all of the labs in the protocluster is @xmath3  2% , based on the mean sfr from hine et  al .",
    "( 2016b ) and the mean ly  @xmath2 luminosity for the labs .",
    "the infrared luminosities of the labs indicate that they harbour dust - obscured star formation and we would therefore expect only a small fraction of the 200912    photons to be able to directly escape and photoionise the extended ly  @xmath2 emission .",
    "geach et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) estimated that the average escape fraction for labs is @xmath3  0.6% ; however , we note that , given the factor @xmath3  5 decrease in the stacked submillimetre flux for the labs in the ssa  22 protocluster between the geach et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) study and hine et  al .",
    "( 2016b ) , an average escape fraction of @xmath3  3% is more plausible .",
    "we also note that this is effectively a lower limit on the average escape fraction since it assumes that the ultra - violet emission is only due to star formation , when there is likely to also be a contribution from agn activity . indeed ,",
    "more accurate assessments of the escape fraction based on high spatial resolution alma and _ hst_-stis observations indicate that the escape fraction varies substantially across individual sources ( likely due to the patchiness of the obscured dust ) but can reach values in excess of @xmath3  10% ( j.  e.  geach , in prep ) . despite these caveats we note that our calculated escape fractions are broadly consistent with those estimated for star - forming galaxies at @xmath1  3 ( e.g. ,  iwata et  al .",
    "2009 ; siana et  al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "therefore , on the basis of our results , star formation appears to be a plausible mechanism to produce the ly  @xmath2 emission for all of the labs explored here , although the escape fraction of 200912    photons for lab  2 and lab  3 need to be comparatively high .",
    "as calculated by geach et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , agn activity also appears to be sufficient to be able to produce the ly  @xmath2 luminosity for all of the x - ray detected labs in our sample ( e.g. ,  on the basis of the ly  @xmath2/x - ray luminosity ratio ; see fig .  4 in geach et  al .",
    "however , since the alma sources for lab  2 and lab  3 are offset from the centre of the ly  @xmath2 emission and the x - ray agn , it is also possible that multiple systems photoionise the ly  @xmath2 emission in these giant labs ( as also potentially found for lab  1 ; weijmans et  al 2010 ) and deeper alma observations may reveal fainter star - forming galaxy components .",
    "we finally note that , since the alma sources are unresolved in these four labs ( see  2.3 ) , this places @xmath6  11  kpc constraints on the physical scale of the star - formation emission region .",
    "we have presented alma 870  @xmath0 m observations and calculated the sfrs of eight x - ray detected agns , four of which reside within labs , in the @xmath1  3.1 ssa  22 protocluster . with these data",
    "we have found the following results :    * three of the protocluster agns are detected by alma and have implied sfrs of @xmath3  220410  @xmath4  yr@xmath5 ; the non detection of the other agns places sfr upper limits of @xmath6  210  @xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "the mean sfr of the protocluster agns ( @xmath3  110210  @xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) is consistent ( within a factor of @xmath3  0.72.3 ) with that found for co - eval agns in the field , implying that galaxy growth is not significantly accelerated across the protocluster environment .",
    "however , when also considering alma data from the literature , we find some evidence for significantly elevated mean sfrs ( up - to a factor of @xmath3  5.9 over the field ) for the agns at the core of the protocluster , indicating that the mean growth of galaxies is accelerated in the central region .",
    "we note that the mean sfr at the protocluster core is significantly enhanced by a single extreme object , potentially the progenitor of the brightest cluster galaxy , with a sfr of @xmath3  1600  @xmath4  yr@xmath5 . *",
    "all four of the protocluster labs are associated with an alma source within the extent of their ly  @xmath2 emission , indicating the presence of vigorous star formation .",
    "the alma sources in the two giant labs in our sample are offset from the x - ray agns but are likely to be physically associated with the labs .",
    "the sfrs of the labs are comparatively modest ( @xmath3  150410  @xmath4 ) and are consistent with those expected for co - eval massive star - forming galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the giant labs do not host more luminous star formation than the smaller labs , despite being an order of magnitude more luminous in ly  @xmath2 emission . * on the basis of the star formation and ly  @xmath2 luminosity of the labs we conclude that star formation can power the extended ly  @xmath2 emission ( through photoionisation ) for all of the labs explored here , although the escape fraction of 200912    photons will need to be relatively high for the two giant labs ( lab  2 and lab  3 ) . however , since the alma sources in the giant labs are offset from the centre of the ly  @xmath2 emission and the x - ray agn it is also possible that multiple systems photoionise the ly  @xmath2 emission and deeper alma observations may reveal fainter star - forming galaxy components .",
