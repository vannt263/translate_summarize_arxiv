    "imagine positive charge + q essentially fixed to the origin of coordinates of system @xmath0 by virtue of having a large rest mass , @xmath1 .",
    "let a positive charge , q , of mass @xmath2 be placed distance @xmath3 from q in @xmath0 and experience the influence of a coulomb force , @xmath4 . the amounts of charge are chosen such that their repulsion just balances their gravitational attraction @xmath5 .",
    "having set up this nice balance , you depart along the @xmath6-axis at speed @xmath7",
    ".    obviously , the masses will remain balanced from your new perspective in system @xmath8 .",
    "but in your now moving frame it appears that both electric and magnetic forces act on @xmath9 such that a magnetic field @xmath10 is created by the motion of q relative to you , where @xmath11 is the ( foreshortened ) electric field at q , due to q. here @xmath12 . the sum of electric and magnetic forces as calculated in @xmath8 is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the velocity of q relative to s and , in this case @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to combined electric and magnetic forces of @xmath16 clearly this is a weaker force than that observed in the original system @xmath0 and if gravity were not present it would lead to a slower separation of @xmath17 and @xmath9 as they repelled each other . from @xmath8 , you would see the separation occur in a time dilated way . but now consider the gravitational attraction between masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the fact that you chose to go away and leave this balanced arrangement of electric and gravitational forces can surely have no bearing on its subsequent behavior . to remain motionless",
    "as observed in system @xmath8 , the total force of gravitational origin between the objects in system s must surely be @xmath20 and as originally balanced in @xmath0 , @xmath21 . the part of the force in eq .",
    "( 2 ) that is velocity dependent can be considered to be a gravitomagnetic force . in the s frame",
    "it must exist and must , and does , balance the ordinary magnetic force .",
    "one would expect that eq .",
    "( 2 ) could be obtained by analogy with the electromagnetic case .",
    "@xmath18 would be the source of a @xmath22 field as observed in @xmath8 to be @xmath23 and also a source of a gravitomagnetic field @xmath24 in which @xmath19 moves .",
    "then if the sum of gravitostatic and gravitomagnetic forces would be @xmath25 we would obtain eq .",
    "( 2 ) without further ado .    but",
    "the weak - field limit of general relativity produces a gravitomagnetic field that is @xmath26 ( see , e.g. ref [ 1 ] ) which would lead to gravitomagnetic forces four times stronger than required to balance the ordinary magnetic effect .",
    "the force of gravitational origin in eq .",
    "( 3 ) would become @xmath27 i leave the reader to ponder where this goes wrong .",
    "to see what gravitomagnetic effects we should expect , let us dispense with the electric charges on m and m ( @xmath28 ) and just consider the free fall of @xmath19 toward @xmath18 down the @xmath3-axis starting from rest . in either frame , s or @xmath0 , the small test mass , @xmath19 , would follow a geodesic . in the weak field limit of @xmath0 and in isotropic",
    "coordinates the metric is @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "a lorentz transform to frame @xmath8 [ @xmath31 yields @xmath32 where , at the instant depicted in figure 1 , @xmath33 .",
    "the last terms with @xmath34 arise from the lorentz transformation .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath35 is exactly 4x larger than expected from newtonian theory combined with special relativity .",
    "it partially describes the `` gravitomagnetic '' effect .",
    "of particular interest is that @xmath36 can be considered as arising from a vector potential @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass current density and the gravitomagnetic field is taken to be @xmath39 . but",
    "this term with its extra factor of 4 can not completely describe all of the gravitomagnetic effects , for we have seen that that the assumption that it does leads to an unacceptable result for our gedanken experiment .    in the weak - field limit , we have @xmath40 , neglecting terms involving @xmath41 .",
    "we can use the inverse of the minkowski metric @xmath42 to raise indexes . the geodesic equation for the y - component of motion of @xmath19",
    "is @xmath43 taking @xmath44 , there follows @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "then with a little algebra and using @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48= ( 1-v^2/c^2)\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\ ] ] which is exactly the same result that we get from eq .",
    "( 2 ) if the inertial mass on which @xmath49 acts is @xmath50 .",
    "( 9 ) is a geodesic equation that is correct to order @xmath51 .",
    "what happens in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is that the term @xmath52 manages to cancel @xmath53 of the effect of the factor of 4 in the gravitomagnetic field term .",
    "it would have been very surprising to have obtained any different result , for that would have left the general relativistic approach in conflict with special relativity . from the standpoint of special relativity ,",
    "the freely falling mass could serve as an interval timer , with the interval corresponding to the time to fall some particular small distance down the y-axis .",
    "as observed in @xmath8 , the interval would be dilated and that is exactly what is described by eqs .",
    "( 2 ) or ( 9 ) .",
    "apparently magnetic and gravitomagnetic forces provide mechanism for enforcing time dilation .",
    "the reason that the combination of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) fails to yield eq . ( 9 ) and correctly describe the free - fall problem is that they are only correct to order @xmath54 . they have been combined to produce terms of order @xmath51 , but apparently not all of them . under these circumstances , it would also be expected that they would not correctly predict all gravitomagnetic effects to order @xmath51 .",
    "the gedanken experiment can be made more interesting by allowing m to orbit m in a circular orbit of radius b as observed in @xmath0 .",
    "as observed in @xmath8 , the orbital time period will be dilated and it can be shown from the kinematic equations of special relativity that the orbit diameter will be the usual 2b along y - axis , but be contracted to @xmath55 along the x - axis .",
    "further , a special case in agreement with special relativity can be obtained from eq .",
    "( 8) using @xmath56 , where @xmath57 would be the speed of m relative to m , as observed in s , when m is on the y - axis . neglecting terms in @xmath58 , the resulting acceleration of m for these positions",
    "would be @xmath59 the last term of the equation accounts for the small difference of speeds of m and m relative to reference frame @xmath8 .",
    "the foregoing ruminations have been motivated by recent discussions of laser lunar ranging .",
    "murphy , nordtvedt and turyshev [ 2 ] have recently published new results that claim to have verified eq .",
    "( 4 ) as a source of perturbing acceleration acting on the lunar orbit .",
    "it is claimed that they have established this weak - field limit prediction of general relativity to an accuracy of about 0.1% , which is far better confirmation than expected from the gravity probe b experiment .",
    "ciufolini [ 3 ] has pointed out that the result of murphy et al .",
    "is merely a coordinate dependent effect .",
    "their results were obtained relative to a solar system barycenter frame ( hereafter ssb ) and thus could be transformed away .",
    "kopeiken , on the other hand , says [ 4 ] that there should be no observable effect at all relative to the ssb .",
    "while the gravitomagnetic field due to the sun s rotation can not be transformed away , it is much too small to have a measurable effect on the lunar orbit .",
    "if a gravitomagnetic effect exists relative to the ssb it must be associated with the motions of earth and moon relative to the ssb . for analysis of the lunar motions , the orbital motion of earth",
    "would be regarded as the cause of a @xmath60 field that is some four orders of magnitude larger than that due to solar rotation at the position of the moon .    at the time of a new moon",
    ", the situation would correspond to the masses m and m positioned as shown in figure 1 , with the sun located a long way up the y - axis .",
    "system @xmath0 would be comoving with the earth while system @xmath8 would remain at rest relative to the ssb .",
    "thus whatever would be observed in s should be the same as what is measured relative to the ssb for this particular configuration .",
    "considering the outcome of the previous gedanken experiment , the major effects that we should observe would be time dilation and length contraction . for a lunar orbit radius of @xmath61 and lunar velocity of @xmath62 , the contraction of the lunar orbit parallel to the nearly joint earth - moon orbital motion about the sun would be about 1.9 m. this",
    "would be observed in frame s of fig . 1 , but not in the ssb frame .",
    "in view of the gedanken experiment and eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , we should not expect the combination of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to be confirmed in the ssb frame , notwithstanding the apparent confirmation by murphy , nordtvedt and turyshev [ 1 ] .",
    "they transformed the llr to the ssb frame and then fitted the lunar trajectory using multiple adjustable parameters . in recent years the amplitude of the dominant gravitomagnetic oscillation has been reported as @xmath63 [ 1 ] , @xmath64 [ 5 ] and @xmath65 [ 6 ] .",
    "although the residuals of these curve fits to the lunar range observations are typically less than one cm , the oscillation amplitudes are obviously much more variable . until the statistical errors of determination of the oscillation amplitude exclude the alternatives considered here , the claim that eq .",
    "( 4 ) has been confirmed is unwarranted .",
    "finally , we should note that calculating gravitomagnetic effects relative to a geocentric frame removes several opportunities for error . in this frame",
    "the moon moves in a gravitomagnetic field due to the apparent motion of the sun .",
    "shahid - saless has calculated the expected amplitude of gravitomagnetic lunar orbit oscillations to be about @xmath66 in the geocentric frame ."
