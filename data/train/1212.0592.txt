    "advanced techniques of analysis and interpretation of the eeg signals have grown substantially over the years , with special attention directed to the problems of low spatial resolution and the choice of physical reference . performing the surface laplacian differentiation of scalp potentials",
    "has proved to be an efficient method to address both issues @xcite .",
    "the surface laplacian operation is reference - free and many studies have suggested that it provides a more accurate representation of dura - surface potentials than conventional topography @xcite .",
    "motivated by this observation , numerous experimental studies of both clinical and theoretical interest have been successfully conducted , such as those of @xcite .    in physical terms , the surface laplacian of the scalp potential is a measure of local effects of geometry and boundary conditions on the normal component of the underlying current density .",
    "this follows directly from the quasistatic continuity of the current density , which implies that any change in flux normal to a surface causes a lateral divergence of flow lines , which may be expressed mathematically as the surface laplacian of the surface potential .",
    "this relationship between the surface laplacian of the potential and the normal component of the current density results in a spatial filtering property that is responsible for the majority of practical applications of the laplacian technique .",
    "but unless reliable information is available about the physical process underlying the eeg , relying exclusively on the behavior of the normal component of the current density may imply the neglect of potentially valuable information encoded in other spatial components .",
    "this observation was a compelling reason to undertake the present work .",
    "thus , in our approach we jointly consider the surface laplacian of the scalp potential and the tangential components of the scalp electric field to classify eeg signals .",
    "the rationale for this combination is that the electric field is also locally related to the current density by ohm s law .",
    "each spatial component of the electric field expresses the ( negative ) rate of change of the scalar potential in that direction , but because the eeg is only recorded along the scalp , we can not estimate the field component normal to the scalp surface directly from the data . the use of the surface laplacian to represent this spatial component is not new in the literature .",
    "for instance , @xcite discussed the physical existence of the normal component of the electric field just out of the body surface and used its analytic relationship with the surface laplacian of the potential to construct a surface - charge model to represent bioelectrical sources inside the body . in the appendix",
    ", we use similar considerations to explain the connection between these quantities at electrode sites on a spherical scalp model .",
    "all computations in our work were performed by means of regularized splines on the sphere .",
    "we evaluated the practical effect of the joint approach on five classification tasks , derived from experiments on language , visual stimuli , and a mental task .",
    "the results in terms of effect sizes showed an optimistic prospect for further developments and applications .",
    "all data used in our study were previously obtained in our laboratory as part of experiments on language , vision , and imagination .",
    "we label such experiments as exp.i , exp.ii , and exp.iii , and the subjects who took part in them as s1 , s2 , s3 , @xmath0 , but s1 of exp.i was not necessarily the same as s1 of exp.ii , and so on .",
    "exp.i encompassed three distinct classification tasks and exp.ii and iii one classification task each .",
    "this experiment emerged from rui wang s doctoral work @xcite and is described in detail in @xcite , to which the reader is referred for further details .",
    "the focus was on the identification of brain patterns related to listening to a set of english phonemes having traditional phonological features of consonants ( voicing , continuant , and place of articulation ) and vowels ( height and backness ) .",
    "the stimuli consisted of the sounds of 32 phonemes ( 8 consonants @xmath1 4 vowels ) formed from pairwise combinations of the consonants /p/ , /t/ , /b/ , /g/ , /f/ , /s/ , /v/ , /z/ , and the vowels /i/ ( as in m**ee**t ) , // ( c**a**t ) , /u/",
    "( s**oo**n ) , and /a/",
    "( sp**a * * ) .",
    "these vowels were selected also for being maximally separated in the american - english vowel space , which presumably facilitates classification .",
    "all phonemes were uttered by a male native speaker of english and recorded in audio files at 44.1khz sampling rate .",
    "each syllable was repeated 7 times to produce a variation of pronunciation as commonly occurs in human languages .",
    "this resulted in a total of @xmath2 audio files for presentation .",
    "four adult subjects ( s1-s4 ) , 1 male , participated in this experiment , all reporting no history of hearing problems .",
    "the auditory stimuli were presented to participants in random order via a stereo computer speaker . each participant was instructed to listen carefully to the sounds and try to comprehend them , but no response was required .",
    "the stimulus presentations were grouped into multiple sessions of 896 trials ( 4 repetitions of 224 sounds at random ) .",
    "the trial length , measured from the onset of one stimulus to the onset of the next , had 1,000ms duration , so that each session lasted approximately 15 min .",
    "there was a short break after each block of 56 trials , and the participant could control the length of the break by pressing the spacebar .",
    "the number of trials collected from the participants were : 7,168 ( s1 ) , 3,584 ( s2 ) , 6,272 ( s3 ) , and 4,480 ( s4 ) .",
    "eeg signals were recorded at 1,000hz sampling rate , using a 128-channel geodesic sensor net ( figure[fig : electrode - positions - exp1 ] ) on egi s geodesic eeg system 300 .",

    "these images were presented to participants on a 17-inch led computer screen using the commercial software presentation .",
    "all shapes had approximately the same area of 100@xmath3 , and the physical luminosity was adjusted for each object and color to appear the same at 60 cm from the screen , but no attempt was made to adjust images to each participant , such that the subjective perception of luminosity was the same for all colors and each participant .",

    "the `` go '' sound was uttered by a male native speaker of english and recorded in an audio - isolated cabin using a professional microphone interfaced with a computer via a sound blaster ii ( creative labs ) sound card at 44.1khz sampling rate ( 24  bits ) .",
    "stimuli were delivered using the presentation software .",
    "the `` go '' sound was delivery via high fidelity pc speakers at the level of normal conversation .",

    "the measurement electrodes were all placed in the back part of the head , as depicted in figure[fig : electrode - positions - exp2 ] .",
    "we remark that there was no particular reason for choosing p9 instead of p10 in this montage .",
    "the electrode distribution was asymmetric and p10 was not included as well just because of the small number of channels that were available to perform this experiment .",

    "the signals were passed through a band - pass filter in the range 0.1 - 300hz plus a 60hz notch filter , and digital conversion was performed at a 1khz sampling rate . to reduce features , we carried out offline decimation at 16:1 ratio , thus setting the nyquist frequency at 31.25hz . additionally , we removed unwanted low - frequency components by applying a high - pass filter of 1hz .",
    "finally , we mathematically referenced the decimated signals to the average reference voltage to reduce biases in the analysis of the potential distribution @xcite .",
    "this step had no effect on the tangential field and the surface laplacian derivation , for they are reference - free quantities @xcite .",
    "the signals were visually inspected , but no trial was removed .",
    "thus , robustness to outliers and artifacts was also tested in the classification . in order to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio , we averaged same - class trials over small groups of trials before classification .",
    "we fixed the number of samples per average trial according to the amount of classes and the total number of trials available in the experiment . with this constraint in mind , the number of samples per average trial was set to : 12 ( exp.i , 8 initial consonants ) ; 5 ( exp.i , 32 syllables ) ; 20 ( exp.i , 4 vowels ) ; 5 ( exp.ii ) ; and 5 ( exp.iii ) .      for convenience , we adopted spherical coordinates @xmath6 , where @xmath7 stands for radial distance and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the angular coordinates , with @xmath8 increasing down from the vertex and @xmath9 increasing counterclockwise from the nasion .",
    "the scalar potential , the tangential components of the electric field , and the surface laplacian of the potential were denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the mathematical expressions for these quantities are shown in the supplementary material in terms of partial derivatives of @xmath10 . to obtain these quantities we fitted @xmath10 with a spline interpolant and then applied the partial derivatives analytically to the interpolant .",
    "this computation was carried out using @xmath14-correction to attenuate the effect of spatial noises on the estimates @xcite .",
    "using splines we can calculate partial derivatives at a very low computational cost .",

    "these vectors can be obtained by linearly transforming the potential @xmath46 as    [ eq : diff_matrices ] @xmath47    the analytic expressions for the matrices @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are given in the supplementary material , along with a matlab code implementation .",
    "the fact that @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are reference free implies that @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a reference vector .",
    "that is , the columns of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 sum to zero , regardless of the value of @xmath14 .",
    "a skeptical reader is encouraged to use the matlab code in the supplementary material to test this property .      for statistical comparison ,",
    "each experiment was classified using the potential , the surface laplacian of the potential , the tangential electric field , and a combination of the last two into a three - dimensional vector .",
    "we carried out the classifications on single channels , using a 10-fold cross - validation on linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , the data from each channel and waveform were rearranged in a rectangular matrix , with adjacent rows corresponding to adjacent trials and adjacent columns corresponding to adjacent time samples .",
    "matrices representing vector quantities were given by the concatenation of the individual components .",
    "preliminary classifications were performed with a small number of trials , attempting to find a plausible range of values for the @xmath14 parameter .",
    "this parameter regulates the trade - off between minimizing the squared error of the data fitting and smoothness @xcite , thus influencing spatial differentiations and the classification rates .",
    "the overall most satisfactory results were obtained in a grid with 50 points , covering the interval @xmath59 $ ] in logarithm scale .",
    "hence , for all tasks the classification of each channel was repeated 50 times , varying @xmath14 across this interval .    to further improve the classification rates we applied principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite , but",
    "only the @xmath14-value yielding the highest classification rate was considered in this step .",
    "the classification of pca - transformed data began with the classification of the first principal component , which ordinarily explains most of the variance of the data .",
    "the other components account for residual variance and were added in order of decreasing variance . for the purpose of pairwise comparison",
    "the same random sequence of trials was used in the classification of all waveforms .",
    "we used effect sizes and confidence intervals to assess improvements in classification rates in comparison to the scalar potential .",
    "effect size is a standard measure that addresses the practical relevance of differences in paired comparisons .",
    "typically , it is calculated by dividing the difference between the means of two groups by the combined ( pooled ) standard deviation , i.e. , @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for effect size ( also known as cohen s  @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mean values of the two groups , and @xmath64 is the pooled standard deviation ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the respective variances ) .",
    "we used equation with @xmath67 standing for the potential and @xmath68 standing for the tested waveform .",
    "intuitively , equation expresses how many standard deviations separate the performance of two methods ; the larger the effect size , the greater the performance of the tested method .",
    "a zero effect size indicates a failure in rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference between the methods . in other words ,",
    "the effect size has the following practical application : it tells us not only whether the null hypothesis is being rejected , but also gives us a sense of the strength of this rejection .",
    "in contrast to null - hypothesis significance testing ( often represented by a @xmath69-value ) , the effect size is not particularly sensitive to the sample size , and hence it can be compared across different studies , even though the number of samples is not the same .    in order to make our statistical comparison more reliable , we estimated a confidence limit around each effect size .",
    "namely , the null hypothesis of no practical effect of the tested waveform was rejected at the 95% level of significance only if the estimated confidence interval did not include zero .",
    "the confidence interval of @xmath61 was estimated by the equation @xmath70,\\ ] ] where se is the standard error between the paired rates from @xmath68 and @xmath67 , given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of participants in the experiment and @xmath73 is the correlation coefficient for the paired rates @xcite . note that equation depends on the sample size @xmath72 .",
    "large samples yield small errors and , consequently , narrow confidence intervals .",
    "in contrast , small samples provide less focused estimates of the effect size , but this can not be mistaken as evidence for a null effect , as usually occurs when reporting @xmath69-values .",
    "this remark is particularly important to our study because @xmath72 was generally small , thus resulting in large confidence intervals .",

    "however , this does not invalidate the view that the surface laplacian of the potential and the tangential electric field should be used together to best assess non - overlapping information encoded in different spatial directions .",
    "nevertheless , this exception illustrates a possible situation that may not be possible to predict , and that can be associated to particular features of our experiments .",
    "improvements with sl & ef were generally less significant in multichannel classification .",
    "while the performance of the potential increased substantially with multiple channels , the other waveforms were only slightly more accurate , in some cases yielding effect sizes one standard deviation or more smaller than obtained with using single channels , and in some cases even negative effect sizes .",
    "a possible explanation for this decline in performance may be related to the way we concatenate channels for classification .",
    "such concatenation , which has little practical effect on the nonlocal electric potential disregards the electrodes physical locations , thus worsening the estimation of the surface laplacian differentiation and the electric field , which are local quantities .",
    "we recall that the locality of the electric field and the surface laplacian was a primary reason for conducting this study .",
    "presumably , this property should reflect in a better identification of those brain areas involved in the task performance , opening a prospect for applications on eeg brain mapping and suggesting a criterion for a prior selection of channels to perform classification .",
    "the three tasks studied in exp.i were important to ascertain this hypothesis , since they involved auditory evoked activity and the signals were recorded with a high - density electrode net . in good agreement with anatomical reports ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , our results with sl & ef showed the best performing channel being close to a1 and a2 for all subjects , challenging the notion that the eeg is an unreliable detector of localized activation due to poor spatial resolution .    recognizing vowels from syllables was the most challenging task encountered in our study .",
    "the comparatively low rates achieved in this case were possibly related to variations in the onset of vowels preceded by different consonants . as long - duration consonants take longer to be perceived as compared to short consonants , the onset of the ensuing vowel varied affecting the classification negatively .",
    "evidence of variations in onset was reported , for instance , by @xcite based on the analysis of evoked potential .",
    "our study had several limitations that may have prevented a better assessment of the true capability of the combined use of the surface laplacian and electric field to improve classification .",
    "the use of a spherical scalp model was one of such limitations .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported significant improvements in surface laplacian estimation by reconstructing the scalp surface with magnetic resonance ( mr ) .",
    "also worthy of mention is the work of @xcite in which the surface laplacian was reliably estimated using realistic electrode locations .",
    "it seems , therefore , plausible to conjecture that a similar improvement could occur here , provided that supplementary resources such as mr were available to perform spatial differentiations more accurately .",
    "finally , we remark that numerical differentiations are inevitably affected by noise and the mechanism of @xmath14 regularization has a limit power to prevent such effect .",
    "this limitation could be mitigated by the use of a more sophisticated statistical technique for handling noise .",
    "this paper discussed the method of joint use of the surface laplacian differentiation and tangential electric field to improve eeg classification .",
    "its effectiveness was evaluated in the challenging problem of eeg classification using a variety of experimental conditions . in all experimental conditions ( with one exception discussed above ) , the joint use of the surface laplacian and tangential electric fields resulted in better classification rates for single electrode sites .",
    "the statistical results were quite significant in most cases , supporting a more extensive investigation of this approach in eeg analysis .",

    "the current density is quasistatic continuous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , thus obeying @xmath79 . using spherical coordinates ,",
    "this equation can be expressed in the form @xmath80 we can conveniently rewrite this equation as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the surface divergence of the tangential current density @xmath83 .",
    "the term @xmath84 in the right - hand side of equation represents the contribution of the spherical geometry to lateral spread of current .",

    "this limit corresponds to the model studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath85 represents the rate of vanishing of @xmath86 in the normal direction , and is particularly significant at the scalp - air interface , where the negligibility of the air conductivity causes the abrupt vanishing of @xmath86 along the outer scalp surface .",
    "hence , an intuitive interpretation of equation is that it describes how the geometry and changes in flux in the normal direction affect the behavior of @xmath87 , so as to ensure the continuity of the total current density .",
    "both terms on the right - hand side of equation depend on boundary conditions .",
    "assuming that the scalp is surrounded by air implies the vanishing of @xmath86 along the outer scalp surface due to the negligibility of the air conductivity , which is about 14 orders of magnitude smaller than the scalp conductivity and prevents current to exit the head through the scalp - air interface .",
    "the recording of eeg signal changes this condition locally , causing , inevitably , an outflow of current beneath the measurement electrodes . presumably , without the constraint of the abrupt vanishing of @xmath86 the magnitude of @xmath85 becomes smaller at these locations , so that , at least to the lowest order of approximation , we can use to write @xmath88 it being understood that the position @xmath89 coincides with a scalp electrode location .",

    "but the approximation was obtained without any assumption about brain sources .",
    "the scalp tangential conductivity @xmath90 and the radial conductivity @xmath91 were introduced to account for a prominent directional dependency in the scalp structure , as pointed out by experimental studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
