    "a range of experimental investigations have indicated that underdoped high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) exhibit intriguing properties at temperatures _ above _ the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "most notably , these materials show a strong suppression in the single - particle electronic spectral weight at low energies , even at temperatures far above @xmath0  @xcite , a property referred to as the _ pseudogap_. a number of scenarios have been proposed to account for this loss of spectral weight  @xcite , several of which invoke the notion that remnants of superconducting correlations remain in the non - superconducting state  @xcite , i.e. , that pairing is established locally but that it lacks the long - range coherence in _ phase _ necessary for true superconductivity .    to make progress with understanding the nature of the pseudogap regime , having experimental access to the _ spatial structure _ of the correlated electronic state is likely to be of considerable value  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to identify one possible scheme , involving low - voltage mesoscopic conductance measurements , for probing this structure experimentally , and to describe this scheme within the context of a simple theoretical model .",
    "the basic idea is this .",
    "let us adopt as a working hypothesis the picture of the pseudogap regime in which superconductivity is established locally , but in which the presence and motion of vortices in the superconducting order parameter cause the phase of the superconducting order parameter to be randomized beyond certain correlation length- and time - scales  @xcite .",
    "the effects of such phase fluctuations on the single - particle properties of underdoped cuprates have been explored in refs .",
    "now , the low - voltage conductance of a normal  to  superconducting junction includes contributions associated with the andreev reflection of quasiparticles from the superconducting condensate  @xcite .",
    "what about the low - voltage conductance of a normal  to  pseudogap junction ? given the picture of the pseudogap regime outlined above , and assuming that tunneling through the junction occurs on a time - scale faster than the time - scale for vortex rearrangement , we anticipate that there will be contributions to the conductance due to the andreev reflection of quasiparticles from the _ local _ superconductivity .",
    "however , owing to the phase sensitivity of the andreev reflection process  @xcite , any spatial variation in the phase of the superconducting order parameter over the junction would tend to cause ( diffraction - like ) interference of the quasiparticle / hole waves that have been andreev reflected from the junction , and thereby diminish the associated contribution to the conductance .",
    "now suppose that the normal contact in a normal  to  pseudogap junction has a characteristic linear dimension @xmath1 . if @xmath1 is smaller than the characteristic phase - phase correlation ( i.e.  inter - vortex ) length @xmath2 ( e.g.  the smaller contact in fig .  [ fig : pseudogappict ] )",
    "then , at any instant , rather little phase variation would be expected over the contact and the andreev contribution to the conductance should be barely diminished . however , if @xmath1 is substantially larger than @xmath2 ( e.g.  the larger contact in fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudogappict ] ) then considerable phase variation is expected over the contact , and the andreev contribution to the conductance is likely to be strongly suppressed .",
    "measurements made using a range of mesoscopic contact sizes thus have the capability of providing a direct probe of the spatial correlations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter at various temperatures within the pseudogap regime .",
    "let us emphasize that the concept of andreev interferometry is by no means new ; indeed , several groups have considered this concept both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge this interferometry has primarily been considered in contexts in which reflection is from a truly superconducting region ( rather than from a pseudogap region ) , and in settings in which the phase has an average value that varies in a relatively simple way in space ( such as on either side of a josephson junction ) . here",
    ", we are considering a setting in which the interferometry is being used as a probe of the superconducting fluctuations .",

    "@xcite considered the issue of whether or not the zero - bias tunneling conductance peak  @xcite would survive at temperatures above @xmath0 .",
    "this work involves applying the btk technique  @xcite to the physical picture of the pseudogap regime explored , e.g. , in refs .",
    "it amounts to a computation of the conductance of a normal  to  superconductor interface for a d - wave superconductor in a uniform supercurrent - carrying state , this conductance then being averaged over a gaussian distribution of uniform supercurrents ( in order to model the pseudogap state ) .",
    "this yields a conductance dependent upon the statistical distribution of local values of the supercurrent arising from varying vortex locations .",
    "in contrast , the present work focuses on the spatial correlations of the phase in the pseudogap regime and , specifically , how such correlations may be accessed experimentally .",
    "we now illustrate the ideas of sec .  [",
    "sec : intro ] by computing the conductance of a normal  to  pseudogap junction within the tunneling formalism , and show how this conductance depends on the pseudogap phase - phase correlation function . to this end , we adopt as the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath3  @xcite between a normal state ( n ) and a pseudogap state ( p ) : @xmath4 where the position @xmath5 lies on the normal side of the junction and the position @xmath6 lies on the pseudogap side .",
    "the operators @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) respectively annihilate ( or create ) quasiparticles with spin projection @xmath11 on the normal side at @xmath5 and on the pseudogap side at @xmath6 .",
    "we choose the interface to be in the plane @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 are cartesian coordinates and @xmath14 are the corresponding basis vectors ) and , accordingly , decompose vectors such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 into components parallel ( e.g.  @xmath15 ) and perpendicular ( e.g.  @xmath16 ) to the interface so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this choice , together with the assumption that tunneling only occurs locally at the interface leads us to assert that the tunneling matrix elements @xmath19 are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a microscopic length scale characterizing the thickness of the `` active '' layer for tunneling of particles and @xmath22 is the typical energy scale for this process .",

    "in fact , it is convenient to obtain @xmath23 perturbatively in the tunneling amplitude @xmath31 by applying the matsubara technique to the imaginary - time dependent tunneling current @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the lowest - order term , which is of order @xmath33 , represents the normal ( i.e.  single - particle ) current .",

    "to apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : jtau ] ) to the setting at hand , namely one side of the junction being normal and the other being in the pseudogap regime , we shall need to evaluate the two two - particle green function factors that feature in it , one for the normal side and one for the pseudogap side .",
    "for the normal side , we assume that the corresponding two - particle green function is factorizable into two single - particle green functions , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the single - particle green function on the normal side . on the other hand , for the pseudogap side we adopt a model in which the pseudogap state is a superconductor that is `` disordered '' by a _",

    "static _ phase - phase correlator .",
    "we do not require information concerning the dynamic phase - phase correlation function because we are assuming that the andreev reflection process is rapid , compared with the time needed for vortices to substantially rearrange the phase structure . to support this assumption ,",
    "let us note that the time - scale associated with andreev reflection is of order @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the fermi velocity of the incoming electron and @xmath56 is the amplitude - fluctuation correlation length ( i.e.  the cooper - pair size ) on the pseudogap side .",

    "[ sec : intro ] , a series of mesoscopic conductance measurements involving a range of contact sizes is expected to be rather sensitive to the characteristic length - scale of phase correlations in the pseudogap state .",

    "( [ eq : fin ] ) is modified by the presence of disorder in the normal - metal contact .",
    "as we shall see , in the presence of disorder the most significant contribution to the conductance is associated with so - called cooperon diagrams , familiar from the theory of the weak - localization corrections to the conductivity of a disordered metal  @xcite .    as is conventional ,",

    "although we are focusing on situations in which @xmath133 is larger than the interface size  @xcite , so that one expects substantial sample - to - sample fluctuations ( which may in fact be interesting to study ) , we shall restrict our attention solely to the disorder average of the current .",

    "these cooperon contributions provide the mechanism for the transmission of the phase - sensitive information that would be probed in andreev interferometry experiments involving a disordered normal - metal contact .      before deriving our result for the contribution of the cooperon to @xmath140",
    ", we pause to motivate physically why this particular contribution is significant . in the context of weak localization , the cooperon contribution to the conductance is usefully pictured in terms of constructive interference of pairs of paths involving the scattering of electrons from impurities in reverse order  @xcite .",
    "this interference tends to `` localize '' electrons , thus causing a reduction in conductivity . in the present context , however ,",
    "the origin of the cooperon is slightly different . to see this , consider the amplitude @xmath141 for an electron at position @xmath142 in the normal metal to scatter from a sequence of impurities labeled by the index @xmath143 , to andreev reflect at the position @xmath6 on the interface , to then scatter from the sequence of impurities labeled @xmath144 , and finally to return to the position @xmath142 .",
    "then , the probability for an electron leaving @xmath142 and reflecting from the interface to return to @xmath142 as a hole is given by the squared modulus of the sum of such amplitudes , i.e. , @xmath145    = 6.0 cm    + .2truecm    as is well known , the amplitude @xmath141 depends sensitively on the specific realization of the disorder ; thus , the right - hand side of eq .",
