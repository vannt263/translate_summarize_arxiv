    "two - mode spin squeezed ( tmss ) states are important to consider for a number of reasons .",
    "first , they may be used to demonstrate entanglement experimentally using only spin measurements @xcite .",
    "second , as they are entangled , they may be used as a resource for quantum information , for example , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum computing , superdense coding , etc.@xcite . in addition ,",
    "tmss states are analogous to two - mode squeezed states for light @xcite , which have proven to be useful for quantum information purposes @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to produce tmss states .",
    "recently they have been produced experimentally for samples of atoms by quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements of the spin components @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to produce tmss states of light by combining the two einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) output modes of an optical parametric oscillator with coherent light at polarizing beam splitters .",
    "it is also possible to adapt proposals for generating single - mode spin squeezing to the two - mode case .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that single - mode spin squeezed states can be produced via an adiabatic approach @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one starts with a hamiltonian for which the ground state is easily achieved , and slowly varies the hamiltonian towards one that has as its ground state the optimal spin squeezed state . in principle",
    ", this procedure can be adapted to obtain optimal tmss states .",
    "a drawback to this method is that , in practice , the appropriate hamiltonian may be difficult to realize .",
    "another technique for generating tmss states that may be generalized from the single - mode case is feedback .",
    "feedback has proven to be a powerful technique for state preparation @xcite and measurement @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to produce near - optimal spin squeezing in the single - mode case by continual measurement of the spin operator @xmath2 , and using feedback to bring @xmath3 close to zero @xcite . here",
    "we adapt this method to the qnd measurement approach discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method for production of tmss states in ref .",
    "@xcite suffers the drawback that , although the variances in the sums of the spin components are small , their means are not close to zero . as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the optimal tmss states have zero means .",
    "we would therefore wish to obtain states with zero means in order for them to be as close as possible to the optimal states .",
    "this is analogous to the problem with the production of single - mode spin squeezing as considered by thomsen , mancini , and wiseman ( tmw ) @xcite .",
    "in ref .  @xcite ,",
    "tmss states ( conditioned on the measurement record ) are obtained via qnd measurements of the spin of the atomic samples . in order to perform this qnd measurement ,",
    "an off - resonant pulse is transmitted through two cesium gas samples .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian may be expressed as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a coupling constant , @xmath6 is the @xmath7 component of the instantaneous stokes vector for the light , and @xmath8 is the @xmath7 component of the continuous spin operator .",
    "these variables are explained further in appendix [ sec : apa ] .    in the schrdinger picture",
    "@xmath8 is independent of @xmath9 , and the total stokes vector @xmath10 is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "the total time evolution operator is , therefore , @xmath11 in ref .",
    "@xcite the light is initially linearly polarized , so the light is in the maximally weighted @xmath12 eigenstate .",
    "in addition , the total spin @xmath13 is large , so we may apply a su(2)@xmath14hw(2 ) contraction .",
    "that is , we make the substitutions @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number operator for photons subtracted from the @xmath17 linear polarization mode ( and added to the @xmath18 linear polarization mode ) .",
    "we will assume that the probe beam is in a coherent spin state oriented in the @xmath17 direction ( i.e. , @xmath17 linearly polarized ) , and take the limit @xmath19 so that this contraction is exact .    under this contraction , @xmath20\\to is$ ] .",
    "this means that , under the heisenberg picture , the operator @xmath21 transforms as @xmath22   \\approx s_y^{\\rm in } + \\frac{an}2 j_z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the total number of photons in the pulse .",
    "now we consider two samples , where we will use the notation @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , for the spin operators for samples 1 and 2 , respectively , and @xmath27 .",
    "we may replace @xmath2 with @xmath28 , the total @xmath7 component of spin for the two samples , giving @xmath29 thus a measurement of @xmath30 gives a qnd measurement of @xmath28 . in considering detection , it is more convenient to consider the stokes vector for the light integrated over time interval @xmath31 .",
    "the transformation of this component is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total number of photons in time @xmath31 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , tmss states are obtained by performing qnd measurements on @xmath34 as well .",
    "they achieve this by applying a magnetic field in the @xmath17 direction , in order to induce larmor precession of the @xmath18 and @xmath7 components of the spin .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( [ sdel ] ) becomes @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the frequency of the precession .",
    "in this case measurement of @xmath37 alternately gives qnd measurements of @xmath28 and @xmath34 , thus giving reduced uncertainty in both @xmath28 and @xmath34 .",
    "for the tmss states considered in ref .",
    "@xcite there is the requirement that @xmath38 . here",
    "we will instead take the convention that both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are large and close to the total spin @xmath41 , and replace @xmath34 with @xmath42 .",
    "this is equivalent to a trivial rotation of coordinates for one of the modes and does not require a physical alteration to the experiment . if we now define @xmath43 then eq .",
    "( [ instant ] ) becomes @xmath44    in order for this to be accurate , we require @xmath33 to be large , so that we may perform the su(2)@xmath14hw(2 ) contraction . under this contraction , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the transformation in the quadrature @xmath47 is @xmath48 as the initial state is equivalent to the vacuum state [ under the su(2)@xmath14hw(2 ) contraction ] , it has a variance of 1 in its measured value .",
    "the same is true for @xmath49 , as the extra term only changes the mean .",
    "measurements are made on the output beam by splitting the beam into @xmath50 and @xmath51 linearly polarized components at a polarizing beam splitter and measuring the intensities at the two outputs .",
    "we then define the photocurrent as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the photon counts at the @xmath50 and @xmath51 linearly polarized outputs and @xmath55 is the photon flux @xmath56 .",
    "we may interpret @xmath57 as the measured value of @xmath47 divided by @xmath58 , so the photocurrent is given by @xmath59 where the subscript @xmath60 indicates the average for the conditioned evolution , and @xmath61 is a real gaussian white noise term such that @xmath62 .",
    "we take the limit of small time intervals @xmath31 , though for finite photon flux this would mean that the su(2)@xmath14hw(2 ) contraction is no longer valid , as @xmath33 would go to zero . in order for the limit to be rigorously correct , we need to take the limit of large @xmath55 as well as small @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , this limit should be an accurate approximation for large photon flux .",
    "the conditioned master equation is then @xmath63\\rho_c dt + \\sqrt{\\gamma}dw(t){\\cal h } [ j_z^{(\\omega)}]\\rho_c , \\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 is an infinitesimal wiener increment , @xmath66\\rho = r\\rho r{^\\dagger}-(r{^\\dagger}r\\rho+\\rho r{^\\dagger}r)/2 $ ] , and @xmath67 \\rho = r\\rho+\\rho r{^\\dagger}-{\\rm tr}[(r+r{^\\dagger})\\rho]\\rho$ ] .",
    "the quadrature ( [ quadrature ] ) is measured by detecting the photocurrent ( [ photocurrent ] ) , thereby yielding tmss states .",
    "the drawback is that this will yield nonzero values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , whereas for the optimal tmss states @xcite , the expectation values are zero . in order to obtain states closer to the optimal tmss states",
    ", we apply feedback to bring these expectation values closer to zero . for example , when @xmath70 , we may apply a hamiltonian proportional to @xmath34 in order to bring @xmath68 towards zero , analogous to the case considered by tmw .",
    "when @xmath71 , we wish to apply a hamiltonian proportional to @xmath72 in order to bring @xmath69 towards zero . for arbitrary @xmath9 , we will apply the hamiltonian @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 we choose this definition for @xmath76 because @xmath77=-ij_x^{(+)}$ ] [ we will omit the @xmath78 from this point for brevity ] . as @xmath79 is close to @xmath80 for the states we are considering , this means that rotation about @xmath76 will alter the expectation value of @xmath81 .",

    "next we will consider the possibilities for using an analytic expression for the feedback strength @xmath92 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the approximate relations @xmath102 are used to derive the analytic feedback scheme @xmath103 in the two - mode case , it is possible to obtain the corresponding relation for @xmath79 , but not for @xmath104 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath110 initially this derivative is equal to zero .",
    "however , the value of @xmath104 falls rapidly and that of @xmath79 only falls slowly , so the second term quickly becomes negligible .",
    "if we neglect the second term , the evolution of @xmath79 is @xmath111 which is equivalent to that in the single - mode case .",
    "this technique fails to find the corresponding expression for @xmath104 , but we have found numerically that a good approximation is given by @xmath112 using these results in the expression for the feedback ( [ feed ] ) , we obtain @xmath113      the third alternative that we will consider is optimal feedback . in order to derive this , it is convenient to define the variables @xmath114 the initial state used is that with individual coherent spin states in each arm , so both @xmath115 and @xmath116 are equal to 1 . as time progresses both @xmath116 and @xmath115 decrease . in order for the feedback to be optimal , the value of @xmath115 should be as small as possible for each value of @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath116 decreases by an amount @xmath117 , then the amount by which @xmath115 decreases should be maximized .",
    "this means that the feedback that is optimum will be that which produces the maximum slope .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the optimal feedback , we wish to solve @xmath118 this can be solved using @xmath119 = 0.\\ ] ]    using the master equation ( [ master ] ) , it is straightforward to show that @xmath120 = -\\tfrac 12 [ 1+\\lambda^2]{\\langle { j_x^{(+ ) } } \\rangle}+ 2\\lambda{\\langle { ( j_z^{(\\omega)})^2 } \\rangle}.\\ ] ] determining the corresponding expression for the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ solve ] ) is more difficult , and if it is performed directly it leads to an extremely complicated expression .",
    "however , there is a more convenient way of determining this expression .",
    "note that @xmath121 for large @xmath36 we may average over @xmath9 , which gives @xmath122 numerically this approximation was found to be very accurate . using this result",
    "we find that @xmath123   \\approx { \\rm tr}[(j_z^{(\\omega)})^2\\dot\\rho ] { \\nonumber}\\\\ & = \\lambda^2 \\langle(j_x^{(+)})^2-(j_z^{(\\omega)})^2\\rangle   - \\lambda \\langle 4 j_z^{(\\omega)}j_x^{(+ ) } j_z^{(\\omega)}+j_x^{(+)}\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus we find that eq .",

    "it therefore is also applicable to the case of feedback for single - mode spin squeezing , with @xmath101 , @xmath76 , and @xmath81 replaced by @xmath100 , @xmath82 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the unconditioned master equation ( [ scmaster ] ) was solved using a simple , finite step method with step sizes of @xmath127 .",

    "the plots of @xmath115 versus @xmath116 for analytic feedback and optimal feedback are also shown in fig .",
    "[ xichi ] .",
    "the results for analytic feedback are very similar to those for simple feedback , with @xmath115 dramatically increasing at later times .",
    "in contrast , under optimal feedback the value of @xmath115 monotonically decreases to an asymptotic value for @xmath136 . for small times",
    "the three feedback schemes produce very similar results , and the states obtained using optimal feedback do not pass significantly closer to the optimal state for teleportation .",
    "the last alternative that we consider in this section is the hamiltonian ( [ fouraxis ] ) , which is analogous to the two - axis countertwisting hamiltonian in the single - mode case . the results for this hamiltonian are also shown in fig .",
    "[ xichi ] . for this case",
    "there is significant spin squeezing , but the squeezing is generally poorer than for feedback .",
    "nevertheless , at later times the value of @xmath115 does not rise dramatically ( until @xmath116 falls below zero ) , as opposed to the results for the simple or analytic feedback .",
    "next we consider the results for the conditioned master equation .",
    "there are two examples where it is necessary to consider the conditioned master equation . in the case of simple feedback , at the time that @xmath115 increases dramatically the purity of the state has greatly decreased .",
    "this means that the feedback based on the unconditioned averages , eq .",
    "( [ feed ] ) , is a poor approximation of the feedback based on conditioned averages , eq .",

    "in particular , the value of @xmath115 does not increase dramatically at large times .",
    "this indicates that improved results may be obtained using feedback based on the conditioned state .    on the other hand , implementing this feedback may be far more difficult . in the forms of feedback considered for the unconditioned equation , the feedback was proportional to the measurement record , with a proportionality constant @xmath140 that is a function of time only",
    "this feedback may be performed efficiently by calculating @xmath92 beforehand and programming it into a field programmable gate array @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath140 given by eq .",
    "( [ cofeed ] ) is dependent on the measurement record , and therefore would need to be calculated during the measurement , introducing a significant time delay .",
    "the results without feedback quickly diverge from the line for optimal states , although they do not differ from it greatly .",
    "the major difference is at later times .",
    "while , with feedback , the value of @xmath115 is reduced very close to zero , without feedback the value of @xmath115 can not be reduced as far .",
    "this means that , although a significant reduction in the variances can be achieved via feedback for strong qnd measurements ( where @xmath141 ) , feedback does not give much improvement for weak measurements .",

    "therefore a far more intense beam or a stronger interaction would be required to obtain the two - mode spin squeezing described here .",
    "it must be emphasized that this long time is required for the measurements , not the feedback .",
    "feedback may be applied to the states obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite with a negligible increase in the time required for the experiment . nevertheless , for the conditions of this experiment ,",
    "although the feedback will bring the means of @xmath28 and @xmath34 towards zero , it will not significantly reduce the variances .",
    "it is only when the qnd measurement can be performed strongly enough ( i.e. , with a strong enough interaction over a long enough time ) to obtain spin squeezing close to maximum that an improvement in the variance is obtained by using feedback .",
    "another problem is spontaneous losses due to absorption of qnd probe light .",

    "both this problem and the problem of the long interaction time may be overcome by performing the experiment in a cavity in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "two other common experimental problems are inefficient detectors and time delays . as for the case of single - mode spin squeezing , inefficient detectors do not affect the scaling .",
    "the system has the potential to be far more sensitive to time delays than in the single - mode case , however .",
    "the problem is that , as the spin component that is being measured is rotating rapidly , the feedback may be correcting for measurements of a different spin component .    in order to correct the right spin component , the rotation of the spin component that is measured should have completed an integral number of rotations during the time delay .",
    "experimentally , this means that the magnetic field should be adjusted such that the frequency @xmath36 is an integral multiple of @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the time delay . provided that this is done , time delays should not be more of a problem than in the single - mode case .",
    "two - mode spin squeezed states are important states to produce for quantum teleportation . here",
    "we have shown that it is possible to produce states very close to the optimal tmss states by adapting the feedback for single - mode spin squeezing considered by tmw .",

    "@xcite .    using the simple feedback scheme ( [ feed ] ) it is possible to obtain states that are quite close to optimal tmss states for small times , but strongly diverge from these states at later times .",
    "in particular , for spins above about 5 it is possible to obtain states very close to the tmss states considered for teleportation in ref .",
    "an analytic feedback scheme ( [ analyt ] ) also gives similar results .",
    "this feedback scheme is more practical experimentally , as the appropriate feedback strength to be used is easily calculated .",
    "we have derived the optimal feedback that produces the maximum possible spin squeezing .",

    "this feedback gives states even closer to the optimal tmss states .",
    "we have also derived a hamiltonian for the two - mode case that is equivalent to the two - axis countertwisting hamiltonian introduced in ref .",
    "this hamiltonian produces spin squeezing , but not as strongly as the measurements with feedback .    in the case of spin 1/2 both the feedback ( except for the analytic feedback ) and",
    "the countertwisting hamiltonian produce optimal tmss states",
    ". these states are equivalent to optimal single - mode spin squeezed states if the two modes are considered as a single spin-1 system . in the single - mode case",

    "( [ singlefeed ] ) is used , then the state will continue to be in an optimal state . on the other hand ,",
    "if some other feedback is used , then optimal states will not be obtained .",
    "for example , the analytic feedback considered by lmw does not give optimal states . in order to determine analytic feedback that will give optimal states , note that the differential equations for @xmath192 and @xmath193 are @xmath194 solving these using the feedback ( [ singlefeed ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ optrel ] ) gives @xmath195 this implies that the value of @xmath196 should change with time as @xmath197 this is quite different from the analytic expression applied for larger spins .",
