    "oxygen - rich supernova remnants ( snrs ) are objects whose optical spectra are dominated by oxygen forbidden line emission ( i.e. , [ o  i ] , [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] ) .",
    "this emission arises in radiative shocks in the oxygen - rich ejecta expelled from the core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "292 , which is the result of an unrecorded sn that took place about 3000 years ago ( ghavamian , hughes & williams 2005 ; winkler & long 2006 ) , is one of only seven such o - rich snrs known today . in [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 optical images 292 is dominated by a distinct , crescent - shaped structure approximately 1 in size ( hereafter the ` spur ' ) located on the eastern side of the snr ( goss 1979 ) .",
    "a collection of localized clumps ( fast - moving knots , or fmks , similar to those seen in cas a ) have also been found in the interior of 292 ( ghavamian , hughes & williams 2005 ; winkler & long 2006 ) .",
    "this contrasts with the appearance of the snr at x - ray ( clark , tuohy & becker 1980 ; park 2002 ; 2004 , 2007 ; gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 ) and radio ( gaensler & wallace 2003 ) wavelengths , where the remnant appears as a slightly elliptical shell approximately 8 across .",
    "the x - ray emission from o - rich snrs , including 292 , tends to arise from faster , non - radiative shocks in lower density ejecta and interstellar gas .",
    "292 has a complex x - ray morphology , with wide - spread shocked circumstellar material superposed on a network of shocked ejecta knots .",
    "the snr also features a filament ( or filaments ) stretching east - west across the middle of the snr ( commonly called the ` equatorial belt ' in earlier papers ) .",
    "analyses of  data indicate the equatorial belt is of normal composition , suggesting shocks propagating in circumstellar material ( park 2002 , 2004 ; gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 ; lee 2010 ) .",
    "292 also hosts a pulsar ( psr j1156 - 5916 ) with a spin down age of 2900 years ( camilo 2002 ) .",
    "the pulsar has been detected over much of the electromagnetic spectrum ( see camilo 2002 for radio observations , hughes 2003 for x - rays ) , including 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath0 with the irac imager on  ( zyuzin 2009 ) .",
    "the pulsar wind nebula of psr j1156 - 5916 has also been detected in the radio ( gaensler & wallace 2003 ) , ir ( irac imagery at 4.5 @xmath0 and 8.0 @xmath0 ; zyuzin 2009 ) and in the x - rays ( hughes 2001 ) .",
    "with all these properties and as the second youngest o - rich snr known in the galaxy , 292 is an important object for understanding how core - collapse snrs evolve .",
    "here we report on a set of imaging observations of 292  obtained with the mips and irs instruments on .",
    "the mips 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 images trace mostly emission from warm dust heated by shocks in the shocked circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "our observations also included irac imagery at 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath0 , though no discernible emission from 292 was detected in these two wavebands ( consistent with non - detection at similar wavelengths in the akari observations ( lee 2009 ) .",
    "narrow band images constructed from our irs spectral maps trace emission from the strongest mid - ir emission lines and provide clues to the location of ejecta within the snr .",
    "the observations reported here are part of a follow - up to our earlier irs observations of two positions in 292 ( ghavamian et al .",
    "the spectra obtained earlier showed emission lines from [ ne  ii ] @xmath112.8 , [ ne  iii ] @xmath215.5,36.0 , [ ne  v ] @xmath124.3 , and [ o  iv ] @xmath125.9 , but no clear evidence of emission from heavier elements .",
    "this contrasts with cas a , where in addition to these lines , irs spectra showed significant [ ar  ii ] @xmath17.99 , [ fe  ii ] @xmath117.9 and [ s  iii ] @xmath218.7 , 33.5 emission ( rho 2008 ; smith 2009 ) .",
    "our goal here is to provide a more general description of the snr as a whole in the mid - ir .",
    "the observations in this paper complement the existing akari study of 292 by lee ( 2009 ) where mid - ir imagery was acquired of the snr in 10 bands centered at wavelengths ranging from 2.7 @xmath0 to 180 @xmath0 ( including 24 @xmath0 band with similar sensitivity and spatial resolution to the mips 24 @xmath0 images presented here ) .",
    "in addition to the imagery , akari spectra were obtained from a section of the belt exhibiting the brighest x - ray emission , as well as the lower portion of the o - rich spur seen in the [ o  iii ] imagery of 292 .",
    "our new irs spectral maps cover the entire snr over the 5 @xmath0 - 36 @xmath0 range , providing access to emission lines not covered in the akari observations such as [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] @xmath125.9 , [ ne  iii ] @xmath115.5 @xmath0 ( which falls in a gap in akari spectral coverage between 13 @xmath0 and 18 @xmath0 ) and [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 . in addition , unlike lee ( 2009 ) who focused on properties of the integrated ir emission from the entire snr , our analysis includes analysis of shocked csm in localized regions within 292 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the observations and the techniques used to reduce the data , including the creation of narrow band images from the irs data . in section 3",
    ", we describe the broad band images and compare them to x - ray and optical images of the snr . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the emission line images , and discuss these primarily in the context of ejecta from the snr .",
    "observations of 292 described here were performed during cycle 4 of ( pid 40583 ; p. ghavamian , pi ) and utilized the mips ( 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 ) and irs instruments ( long - low module only ) in mapping mode .",
    "the mips data were obtained on 2008 march 13 ( 70 @xmath0 ) and 2008 april 15 ( 24 @xmath0 ) , while the irs data were taken on 2008 august 13 . the mips raster maps at 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 covered the entire snr ( 83 across , or 14 pc at an assumed distance of 6 kpc , gaensler & wallace 2003 ) , as well as a sizeable swath of the surrounding sky .",
    "the mips 24 @xmath0 observations were performed in a one - cycle raster map , with an exposure time of 10 s per pixel and a total integration time of 500 s. the 70 @xmath0 observations were also obtained in a one - cycle raster map , with an exposure time of 10s per pixel and total integration time of 380s .",
    "the 1-@xmath3 extended source sensitivity of the mips observations was approximately 0.2 at 24 @xmath0 and 4 at 70 @xmath0 .",
    "the mips images of 292 are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the irs spectral maps utilized one cycle of 5 pointings parallel to the ll slit , separated by 120@xmath4 , along with 112 pointings taken in 6@xmath4 steps perpendicular to the slit . both ll1 ( 1st order , 19.5 - 38.0 @xmath0 ) and ll2 ( 2nd order , 14.0 - 21.3 @xmath0 ) were active during the mapping scans , with an exposure time of 32s per pixel ( 560 individual spectra ) .",
    "the irs mapping footprint for these observations is shown overlaid onto the mips 24 @xmath0 image in figure  2 .",
    "our mips data were processed using calibration pipeline version s18.12.0 .",
    "mips delivers diffraction limited images , so that the relative spatial resolution of any two mips channels differs by the ratio of their central wavelengths . to compare the surface brightnesses of features between images",
    ", we first degraded the spatial resolution of the 24 @xmath0 image to that of the 70 @xmath0 image by convolving the former with a psf kernel using the idl - based convolution kernels software convimage ( gordon 2008 ) .",
    "we used a psf kernel appropriate for a 50  k blackbody source .",
    "while we do not expect the continuum emission to follow a simple blackbody shape , this temperature is approximately midway between the temperatures of the cold",
    "( @xmath530  k ) and warm ( @xmath570  k ) csm dust components fit to the irs staring mode spectra of 292 by ghavamian ( 2009 ) . after the convolution we used the aips ( astronomical image processing system ) task hgeom to resample the convolved 24 @xmath0 image ( 255 pixel@xmath6 ) onto a grid matching that of the 70 @xmath0 image ( 53 pixel@xmath6 ) . to extract surface brightness values from selected regions around 292",
    "we utilized the funtools package of sao ( https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~john/funtools/ ) .",
    "to compare localized variations in the 70/24 flux ratios with the corresponding x - ray emission in 292 , we estimated the x - ray brightnesses using the deep 510 ks image of 292 ( park 2007 ) .",
    "we started with the level 1 event file from that observation , processed in the manner described in park ( 2007 ) and filtered over the 0.3 - 8.0 kev range . before extracting the x - ray fluxes we blurred the filtered image to the same resolution as the mips 24 @xmath0 image .",
    "the pixel scale of irac images is 06 pixel@xmath6 , which is close to the 05 pixel@xmath6 pixel scale of the images .",
    "therefore , we convolved the x - ray image using the convimage kernels appropriate for blurring an irac 3.6 @xmath0 image to mips 24 @xmath0 resolution",
    ". we again used the convolution kernel appropriate for a 50  k blackbody .",
    "finally , we extracted the x - ray counts from individual regions ( 18 regions were selected , described later in section 4 ) in the convolved x - ray image using the funcnts application .",
    "we utilized an annular region surrounding 292 in the image to estimate the underlying background level ( marked in figure  3 ) .",
    "although the background region includes a number of faint point sources , their total contribution to the background counts is negligible ( @xmath72% ) , so their contribution was not removed before scaling and subtracting the background from each extraction region .",
    "after background subtraction , we converted the resulting net counts to count rates by dividing by the exposure time ( 510 ks ) .",
    "we then converted the count rates to surface brightness using the pimms tool from cxc .",
    "note that the x - ray fluxes are estimated without actual spectral modeling , resulting in less accurate flux estimates than would be obtained with spectral models .",
    "however , we only seek crude flux estimates for the purpose of identifying systematic trends in the ratios of ir to x - ray emission . since the fluxes are extracted from csm shocks , we assumed abundances 0.2 times solar , while taking @xmath86@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath120.75 kev .",
    "these parameters reflect average values for these parameters measured around the rim of 292 by lee ( 2010 ) .",
    "we performed our irs spectral mapping analysis using data processed with calibration pipeline version s18.7.0 . using the idl cubism software ( smith 2007 )",
    ", we assembled the 560 basic calibrated data files ( bcds ) into two data cubes , one for ll1 and one for ll2 .",
    "the bcds are heavily affected by hot pixels ( especially beyond 35 @xmath0 ) , which results in vertical columns of elevated pixels in the assembled data cube . to mitigate the effects of these hot pixels",
    ", we median smoothed the bcds prior to creating the data cubes by using the @xmath13 routine from the idl astronomy user s library .",
    "the smoothing replaces the value of each pixel with the median of the surrounding 3 pixels in a moving box .",
    "while this reduces the spatial resolution of the data in the bcds somewhat , it significantly mitigates the hot pixel columns in the resulting datacube .",
    "the background emission around 292 varies noticeably across the face of the snr in both mips images . at 24 @xmath0 ,",
    "the background is about 17.6 in the northeastern corner of the image in the region used for estimating the background emission in the data cubes .",
    "the background rises to a maximum of 18 in the southwestern corner of the image .",
    "the corresponding background surface brightnesses in the 70 @xmath0 image are 32 and 35 , respectively .",
    "this emission gradient can be seen in figure  1 .",
    "the variability is due in part to the presence of an h  ii region along the line of sight just south of 292 .",
    "it appears as patchy diffuse emission in the narrowband h@xmath14 , [ s  ii ] and [ o  iii ] images of the snr ( winkler & long 2006 ) .    in the irs",
    "datacubes the h  ii region along the line of sight to 292 contributes [ ne  iii ] @xmath215.5 , 35.0 , [ s  iii ] @xmath218.7 , 35.0 and [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 line emission , as well as a photo - excited dust continuum starting near 15 @xmath0 and slowly rising beyond the edge of the irs bandpass at 40 @xmath0 .",
    "the sky spectrum also shows a cluster of faint , closely spaced emission features between 15 @xmath0 and 20 @xmath0 .",
    "these features are characteristic of pah emission from the intervening photodissociation regions at 16.4 and 17.0 @xmath0 , as well as h@xmath15 s(1 ) 17.1 @xmath0 emission . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "faint h@xmath15 28.2 @xmath0 emission is also detected in the sky spectrum .",
    "the excess contribution from this diffuse component , after subtraction of background from the northeastern corner of the datacube , results in residual emission in the datacube when extracting emission line images .",
    "in figure  1 we present the 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 mips images of 292 .",
    "the snr appears in both bands as an elliptical shell with a banded structure running e - w across its middle , similar to what is observed in the images ( park 2002 ; 2004 ; 2007 ; lee 2010 ) . for the most part ,",
    "the morphology and brightness variations of the shell match those seen in the x - rays , with the main difference being the lack of prominent ir emission from x - ray emitting o - rich and ne - rich ejecta .",
    "these results are consistent with continuum emission from circumstellar dust heated by the non - radiative forward shock in 292 . lee ( 2009 )",
    "reached the same conclusion based on their akari imagery of 292 .",
    "both the spur and the fmks can be seen in the 24 @xmath0 image , tracing the [ o iv ] @xmath125.9 produced by radiative ejecta shocks .",
    "the [ o  iv ] emission from these shocks closely follows the distribution of [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 emission observed in narrowband optical imagery ( tuohy , burton & clark 1982 ; winkler & long 2006 ) and optical imaging spectrometry ( ghavamian , hughes & williams 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , both the spur ( and as we show in section 3.2.2 , the southernmost fmk ) exhibit emission from a spectral bump between 15 and 25 @xmath0 in our irs spectral maps . this bump ( likely a signature of ejecta dust heated in the radiative shocks ) also contributes emission to the mips 24 @xmath0 image of 292 .",
    "the flux ratio between ir images at two different wavelengths is sensitive to such parameters as the dust temperature , gas density and dust - to - gas ratio ( dwek 1987 ) . to investigate the global 70/24 flux ratio in 292",
    ", we used the funcnts application from funtools to integrate the 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 emission across the face of 292 ( avoiding bright stars within the remnant periphery ) .",
    "we then estimated the total flux and luminosity of the snr in these bands .",
    "we subtracted the sky contribution in each band using an annular region encircling 292 ( marked in figure  3 ; the same background annulus was used for both the 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 images ) .",
    "similar to the x - ray data , the background annuli in our 24 @xmath0 images contain point sources ( none are present in the 70 @xmath0 images ) .",
    "these point sources contribute @xmath73% to the total counts in the backround regions . after scaling and subtracting the background ,",
    "the resulting fluxes are 9.8 jy at 24 @xmath0 and 26.4 jy at 70 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the globally averaged 70/24 ratio is 2.7 , an intermediate value between the local minimum of 1.4 and local maximum of 5.5 reported in table  1 .",
    "these fluxes are in good agreement with the two - temperature modified blackbody sed ( a mixture of graphite and silicon ) calculated by lee  ( 2009 ) for a 3000 year old snr with preshock density of 0.5 @xmath16 . assuming a distance of 6 kpc to 292 ( gaensler & wallace 2003 ) , the corresponding luminosities in the mips bands are @xmath171.9@xmath910@xmath18 ergs s@xmath6 and @xmath19 1.4@xmath910@xmath18 ergs s@xmath6 ( note the luminosity at 24 @xmath0 includes the contribution of [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] line emission near 25.9 @xmath0 ) .    localized variations in the 70/24 flux ratio can be observed both along the shell and throughout the interior of 292 .",
    "the 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 surface brightnesses are shown in table  1 for a selection of individual regions , along with the corresponding 70/24 ratios .",
    "a trend seen in these ratios is that they tend to be largest ( i.e. , implying coldest dust ) along the elliptical outer blast wave of 292 .",
    "the hottest csm dust tends to be found along the equatorial belt , though some of the clumpy belt material also extends toward the southwest of the snr .",
    "a conspicuous difference between the ir and x - ray appearance of 292 is the presence of strong ir emission in parts of the shell lacking x - ray emission .",
    "these differences can be seen in figure  3 , where the individual regions have been marked on the mips 24 @xmath0 and 0.3 - 8.0 kev images .",
    "regions 6 - 10 in the southwestern portion of 292 mark clumps where the ir emission in both mips images is particularly strong compared to the x - ray emission .",
    "the spectral properties of these clumps are clearly different from those of the circumstellar belt ( numbered 13 - 18 in figure  3 ) and most of the shell ( regions 1 - 4 and 11 - 12 ) .",
    "in contrast , sections of the circumstellar belt ( regions 13 - 18 ) are prominent both in the mips and images .",
    "these suggest significant differences between physical conditions in the southwest and those in the rest of the shell and circumstellar belt .",
    "x - ray spectra of regions 13 - 18 extracted from the 510 ks observation ( park 2007 ) exhibit no evidence of ejecta ( enhanced metal ) abundances , and in fact appear fully consistent with cosmic ( subsolar ) abundances .",
    "in addition , the southwestern clumps are not detected in either the [ o  iii ] image of 292  ( winkler & long 2006 ) , nor in [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] , [ ne  iii ] or [ si  ii ] in our irs maps of 292 , an indication their emission arises in non - radiative shocks .",
    "in addition to the ir continuum generated by the shock heated dust in 292 , the snr is also detected in ir forbidden line emission from shocked ejecta .",
    "the detected lines were described by ghavamian ( 2009 ) , who reported strong o and ne emission ( as well as possible weak s line emission ) from the spur .",
    "clear variations can be seen in the relative fluxes of the ejecta lines in the irs spectral maps , reflecting variations in physical conditions in the ejecta .",
    "to map these variations , we first used cubism to extract emission line images from the irs spectral map .    due to the presence of underlying dust continuum throughout most of the ll2 and all of the ll1 bandpass , isolating the emission line component required estimation of the continuum level under each line , then the subtraction of this continuum at each position in the datacube . to perform this subtraction , we first used cubism to isolate the continuum emission over a narrow sub - band on either side of the [ ne  iii ] @xmath115.6 and [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] @xmath125.9 lines .",
    "the corresponding sub - bands used for the [ si  ii ] image were both chosen from continuum on the blue side of 34.8 @xmath0 to minimize the impact of hot pixels on the continuum - subtracted [ si  ii ] image .",
    "collapsing the emission in each of the two bands , we generated two ` off - band ' images of 292 near each spectral line .",
    "we then averaged the two images to approximate an image of the continuum underlying each of the emission lines .",
    "we scaled and subtracted this averaged image from that formed by integrating emission from the 292 datacube over each of the o , ne and si lines .",
    "the scaling factor applied to each background image before subtraction was ( 1.05,1.0,1.10 ) for [ ne  iii ] , [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] , and [ si  ii ] respectively .",
    "the wavelength ranges integrated for estimating the underlying [ ne  iii ] @xmath115.5 continuum in the datacube were 15.0 - 15.2 @xmath0 and 15.9 - 16.1 @xmath0 , while that for [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] @xmath125.9 were 23.4 - 23.9 @xmath0 and 26.9 - 27.4 @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding ranges for [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 @xmath0 were 31.4 - 32.5 @xmath0 and 32.0 - 32.7 @xmath0 .",
    "the [ ne  v ] @xmath124.3 emission detected in 292 ( ghavamian 2009 ) was not strong enough to allow creation of useful maps once the nearby continuum was subtracted .    despite the presence of strong [ s  iii ] @xmath218.7 , 33.5 emission in the datacube , nearly all of this component consisted of unrelated foreground emission ( likely from the h  ii region along the line of sight ) as well as photo - ionized ism surrounding 292 .",
    "none of the ejecta in our irs maps showed significant [ s  iii ] emission , although the partially radiative csm shocks in the equatorial belt of 292 show weak [ s  iii ] @xmath118.7 emission ( figure  6 ) .",
    "the presence of weak [ s  iii ] from the equatorial belt is consistent with the presence of partially radiative shocks detected in [ o  iii ] in the rutgers fabry - perot observations of 292 ( ghavamian , hughes & williams 2005 ) .",
    "the [ ne  iii ] and [ o  iv ] emission line maps are shown in figure  4 .",
    "the pixel scales of the images are 5pixel@xmath6 , with each image 112@xmath9112 square .",
    "they bear a strong resemblance to the [ o  iii ] optical image ( winkler & long 2006 ) , indicating that the oxygen and neon originate from the same nucleosynthetic layers within the progenitor .",
    "the most prominent o - rich structure , the spur , is clearly detected in both line maps , while the fmks seen near the northern and southern edges of 292 in the [ o  iii ] images have faint counterparts in [ ne  iii ] and [ o  iv ] .",
    "the faint bands of [ o  iii ] emission stretching southward from the spur ( the ` streamers ' ) and westward toward the middle of 292 are also detected in the ir .",
    "however , there are also some differences between the [ ne  iii ] and [ o  iv ] images .",
    "the shape of the spur differs slightly in the two images , with the [ o  iv ] emission having a somewhat clumpier morphology than the [ ne  iii ] emission .",
    "in addition , the fmks near the southern edge of 292 are more prominent in the [ ne  iii ] images .",
    "in particular , the southernmost fmk ( an ejecta knot with one of the highest proper motions in 292 ( winkler 2009 ) and which we name ` runaway fmk ' ) is prominent in the [ ne  iii ] image , but barely detected in [ o  iv ] . this may be due in part to differences in the continuum subtraction between the two images .",
    "both the sky and snr continuum just begin to turn on near 15 @xmath0 , and increase steadily past 26 @xmath0 .",
    "subtraction of this continuum adds more noise to the resulting [ o  iv ] image than to the [ ne  iii ] image in figure  4 , making it more difficult to detect intrinsically faint features such as the fmks in [ o  iv ] .    summing the emission over all the radiatively shocked ejecta in 292 , we find that @xmath20}\\,\\approx\\,$]8.2@xmath910@xmath21 and l@xmath22+[fe~ii])}\\,\\approx\\,$]2.6@xmath910@xmath23 , assuming a distance of 6 kpc .",
    "the [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] luminosity of 292 ( which should be close to the intrinsic value due to the minimal impact of interstellar reddening at 25 @xmath0 ) is approximately six times lower than the unreddened [ o  iii ] luminosity ( 1.6@xmath910@xmath24@xmath25 ) reported by winkler & long ( 2006 ) . on the other hand , the [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 emission map shows no emission from the spur .",
    "save for the belt of o - rich material running westward from the spur ( not to be mistaken with the circumstellar belt seen in x - rays ) , none of the radiatively shocked o - rich ejecta produce significant [ si  ii ] emission .",
    "the only feature clearly visible in the [ si  ii ] image in figure  4 is a blob of emission located just interior to the spur . although the [ si  ii ] image is considerably noisier than the [ ne  iii ] and [ o  iv ] images and suffers from fixed pattern residuals leftover from the hot pixel interpolation , it is evident that there is no substantial [ si  ii ] emission from the radiatively shocked , optically bright ejecta in 292 .",
    "the ability to generate images of 292 in isolated spectral ranges from our irs maps allows us to isolate regions of pure continuum emission to search for emission from shock - heated ejecta dust . in our earlier spectroscopic study of 292",
    "( ghavamian 2009 ) we identified a broad bump of emission arising from the lower section of the o - rich spur and centered near 18 @xmath0 and extending from 15 @xmath0 to 25 @xmath0 . aside from this prominent bump , the only other observed spectral features from the spur were emission lines .",
    "the spectral bump is a possible signature of protosilicate dust emission from mg@xmath15sio@xmath26 or mgsio@xmath27 , and has been detected in irs maps of 1e0102@xmath2872.3 ( sandstrom 2009 ; rho 2009 ) and cas a ( rho 2008 ; smith 2009 ) .",
    "detection of the 15 - 25 @xmath0 bump in 292 could be evidence that dust formed in the sn ejecta , and that this dust is currently being heated in the radiative ejecta shocks .",
    "however , given the complicated mixture of the shocked and photoionized csm ( as well as unrelated foreground emission from the nearby h  ii region ) overlying the spur in 292 , we sought to confirm the spatial coincidence of the emission bump with the supernova ejecta .",
    "to this end , we used cubism to subtract the line of sight background from the datacube using emission off the eastern edge of 292 ( we used sky in this region because it is closest to the spur ) .",
    "we then integrated the emission between 15 @xmath0 and 25 @xmath0 from our irs ll2 datacube of 292 , while excluding the [ ne  iii ] @xmath115.5 line emission from the ejecta in this bandpass .",
    "although there is no evidence of significant [ s  iii ] @xmath118.7 emission from the ejecta , we excluded this emission line as well during the integration .",
    "this sky - subtracted continuum image of 292 in the 15 - 25 @xmath0 range is shown in the lower right panel of figure  4 .",
    "the 15 - 25 @xmath0 map shows extensive continuum emission from 292 , arising almost entirely from shock - heated csm dust . the equatorial belt and southwestern regions ( e.g. , regions 13 - 16 and 6 - 10 ) are especially prominent , while the lower density filaments along the elliptical shell ( e.g. , regions 1,2,11 and 12 from figure  3 ) are fainter .",
    "these trends are consistent with the dust temperature variations reflected in the 70/24 flux ratio .",
    "the continuum from most of the csm shocks begins near 15 @xmath0 , then rises steadily past the red end of the irs bandpass at 36 @xmath0 .",
    "remarkably , however , some of the radiatively shocked o - rich ejecta ( such as the spur ) are also detected in the 15 - 25 @xmath0 map .",
    "the runaway fmk ( marked by a red arrow at the bottom of each panel in figure  4 ) , which has been thrown clear of most of the shocked csm in the interior of 292 , can also be seen .",
    "the knot is located in a region of lower , less complicated background emission , allowing the emission from this knot to stand out more easily than for the other fmks lying in the projected interior .",
    "the detection of 15 - 25 @xmath0 ir continuum from both the spur and the runaway fmk is strong evidence that whether the emission arises from a 15 - 25 @xmath0 ` bump ' or some other type of emission feature , dust grains most likely formed in the o - rich ejecta and are currently being heated by radiative shocks .",
    "the effective temperatures of heated interstellar dust grains in snrs are largely dependent on the post shock gas density ( dwek 1987 ; dwek , foster & vancura 1996 ) , and hence , by extension , on the preshock gas density . at the high gas temperatures encountered in young non - radiative snrs , the impact of electrons from the hot postshock plasma is the primary source of dust heating . on the other hand ,",
    "dust sputtering in these shocks is primarily caused by proton impacts . at these high temperatures ,",
    "the amount of energy deposited per electron impact into the dust grains is approximately constant , so that the equilibrium dust temperature ( and hence ir emissivity ) of the dust depends mainly on the electron ( and hence gas ) density ( e.g. , figure  6b from dwek 1987 and figure  8 from dwek , foster & vancura 1996 ) . assuming similar gas temperatures , compositions and column densities in the csm shocks ( consistent with the x - ray spectral fits of lee ( 2010 ) ) , regions with bright x - ray emission should broadly correlate with regions of high gas density , which in turn correlate with regions having bright ir emission and high dust temperatures .",
    "the brightest x - ray emission should then correspond to ir emission with the smallest 70/24 flux ratios .    comparing the mips and x - ray images of 292",
    ", we find that there does appear to be a correlation between the 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 surface brightnesses and the x - ray surface brightness for most of the csm shocks in 292 .",
    "interestingly , however , there are departures from this relationship observed along the southwestern side of 292 . specifically , the surface brightnesses of the southwestern csm clumps ( corresponding to regions 6 - 10 in figure  3 ) are @xmath53 times higher than the rest of the shell in both ir bands , yet their x - ray counterparts are either faint or almost non - existent . the lack of bright x - ray emission matching the bright ir clumps in the sw is not due to enhanced local absorption of x - rays , since lee ( 2010 ) did not find a large enough variation in column density ( 5@xmath910@xmath29 7@xmath910@xmath10 ) around the rim to account for the reduced x - ray flux in the sw corner of 292 .    to quantify the relationships described above",
    ", we plotted the 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 surface brightnesses of the selected regions in 292 against the x - ray surface brightnesses of those regions in figure  5 ( top panel ) .",
    "the 70/24 ratios ( which are plotted against the x - ray surface brightnesses in the lower panel of figure  5 ) show a noticeable declining tend with increasing x - ray emission , consistent with our prediction .",
    "one caveat to consider when interpreting figure  5 is that x - ray emission from the ejecta overlies the emission from some of the csm shocks .",
    "therefore , the x - ray count rates in some of the csm regions plotted in figure  5 are over - estimated to various degrees ( save for region 4 , most of the regions contain little or no discernible emission from ejecta ) . the ejecta contribution to the region",
    "counts is likely to add scatter to the values along the horizontal axis of the plot .",
    "however , the plot is still useful for identifying systematic trends between the ir and x - ray properties of 292 , and they clearly demonstrate a relationship between emission in the two bands . the 70 @xmath0 fluxes show more scatter than the 24 @xmath0 fluxes and their distribution appears somewhat flatter than the 24 @xmath0 when plotted versus x - ray surface brightness . dividing the two fluxes results in a more distinct correlation , with the 70/24 ratio declining with x - ray surface brightness .",
    "the trend between the 70/24 ratio and the x - ray surface brightness is also consistent with predictions from the shock models of dwek , foster & vancura ( 1996 ) .",
    "specifically , the lowest ratios ( @xmath51.5 - 1.8 ) are found in the denser material of the equatorial belt , while the largest ratios ( @xmath52.5 - 5 ) are found in the low density , fainter sections of the outer shell .",
    "a more quantitative comparison can be made with the dwek , foster & vancura ( 1996 ) predictions by using dust spectra for their 800 shock models ( this shock speed gives a temperature closest to the average of the temperatures of the different regions measured by lee ( 2010 ) ) . from figure  8c of dwek , foster & vancura ( 1996 ) , the dust spectra for preshock gas densities of 0.1 @xmath16 and 1.0 @xmath16 should be most appropriate for modeling the ir emission from the equatorial belt and circumstellar shell in 292 , respectively .",
    "the dust spectra from dwek , foster & vancura ( 1996 ) predict @xmath302.3 for n=0.1 @xmath16 and @xmath31 @xmath320.7 for n=1 @xmath16 .",
    "the predicted flux ratios are then @xmath336.7 for n=0.1 @xmath16 and @xmath332 for n=0.1 @xmath16 .",
    "these compare favorably with the observed ratios for the equatorial belt and outer shell in table  1 , though the observed ratios for the shell are somewhat lower than predicted .",
    "this is likely due to the inferred preshock density of the shell obtained by lee ( 2010 ) ( @xmath50.3 - 0.5 @xmath16 ) being slightly larger than that of the n=0.1 @xmath16 model of dwek , foster & vancura ( 1996 ) .",
    "overall , the regions with the hottest dust in figure  5 are ( not suprisingly ) regions 15 , 17 and 18 , corresponding to the brightest clumps in the image of 292 . park ( 2002 )",
    "found that the equatorial belt ( region 15 ) had a higher density and slightly lower temperature than the outer shell of 292 , while ghavamian , hughes & williams ( 2005 ) detected faint [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 emission from the belt .",
    "this indicates that the elevated density in the equatorial belt in region 15 has caused the shocks to become partially radiative at that location .",
    "the elliptical shell surrounding 292 , where the blast wave propagates through the relic red supergiant ( rsg ) wind ( lee 2010 ) , has the lowest preshock gas densities , and hence the coldest shocked csm dust .",
    "figure  5 provides an important clue to the origin of the elevated ir to x - ray flux ratios in the southwestern portion of 292 .",
    "although the emission in the southwest is bright in both mips images , the 70/24 ratios from this part of 292 ( as reflected in the 70/24 ratios for the csm knots in regions 6 - 10 ) are similar to those of the equatorial belt , where emission is bright in both ir and x - rays .",
    "this suggests that the dust is just as hot in the southwestern csm knots as they are in the belt ( as reflected in the 70/24 ratios for regions 13 - 18 ) .",
    "this in turn implies that the gas densities in the southwest and in the equatorial belt are similar .",
    "therefore , the most likely explanation the anomalously high ir to x - ray ratios of regions 6 , 7 , 9 and 10 is that these clumps have higher dust - to - gas ratios than the clumps in the equatorial belt .",
    "a localized , elevated dust content in the southwest of 292 may indicate that the dust in this portion of the snr is not well coupled to the x - ray emitting gas , or it may reflect variations in the dust condensation efficiency in the relic red giant wind of the progenitor . even allowing for variations in dust content around the rim of 292 ,",
    "the average dust - to - gas ratio inferred by lee ( 2009 ) for this snr ( @xmath510@xmath34 ) is significantly lower than the average galactic value ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) .    in figure  6",
    "we show sample irs mapping spectra extracted from four of the regions marked in figure  3 ( regions 4 , 7 , 15 and 17 ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained from a section of the blast wave in the nw ( region 4 ) , a knot of bright ir emission in the sw ( region 7 ) , the brightest section of the equatorial belt ( region 15 ) and a large clump just above the eastern edge of the equatorial belt .",
    "we subtracted the same background emission from all four of the irs spectra after averaging the emission from two sky regions located just off the eastern and western sides of 292 ( marked by the cyan boxes in the left panel of figure  3 ) .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra from the four regions described above are dominated by a rising dust continuum .",
    "the blast wave emission from region 4 shows a slowly rising continuum which starts near 15 @xmath0 and rises past the red end of the irs bandpass .",
    "in contrast , the clump in region 7 shows a brighter , more steeply rising dust continuum which peaks at a shorter wavelength than region 4 ( at approximately 33 @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is consistent ( based on the discussion in section 4.1 ) with a higher overall density in region 7 than region 4 .",
    "region 15 , while showing a prominent dust continuum , also exhibits faint emission lines of [ ne  iii ] @xmath115.5 , [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] @xmath125.9 , [ s  iii ] @xmath118.7 and [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 .",
    "region 15 has been detected in [ o  iii ] in the optical ( ghavamian 2005 ) , and was shown by park ( 2002 ) to be both denser and cooler than the blast wave filaments encircling 292 .",
    "the shocks in the equatorial belt have formed partial cooling zones and hence are partially radiative , giving rise to the observed faint ir ( and optical ) line emission .",
    "the continuum from region 17 is similar to that of region 15 , indicating similar dust temperature .",
    "the presence of faint [ ne  iii ] @xmath115.5 and [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] @xmath125.9 in the spectrum of region 17 indicates that the shocks in this clump have also started to form radiative cooling zones",
    ".      in their analysis of the 510 ks image of 292 , park ( 2007 ) concluded that the thermodynamic state of the ejecta ( as reflected by temperature , density and ionization state ) exhibits a significant gradient between the southeastern and northwestern sides of 292 .",
    "the x - ray hardness ratios they obtained from the data indicated a substantially lower temperature for the se ( @xmath350.7 kev ) than the w and nw ( @xmath36 5 kev ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that most of the optical and ir - emitting sn ejecta  the spur and its associated streamers  are found in the se of 292 .",
    "the ejecta shocks in the rest of the snr , by contrast , are mostly still in the non - radiative phase .",
    "the trends described above can be seen in the narrowband x - ray images of 292 in o he @xmath14 and ne he@xmath14 ( park 2007 ) .",
    "thse images show a strong spatial correlation with the optical [ o  iii ] and ir [ ne  iii ] and [ o  iv ] emission in the se .",
    "in contrast , the narrowband x - ray images in si he@xmath14 ( which traces hotter gas than o ly@xmath14 and ne he @xmath14 owing to its higher nuclear charge ) is almost entirely absent in the se .",
    "the lack of si emission from the se in both the x - rays and the ir ( save for the isolated [ si  ii ] ejecta blob in figure  4 ) indicates that the reverse shock has not yet encountered most of the si - rich ejecta in the se .",
    "park ( 2007 ) speculated that the cooler thermodynamic state of the ejecta in the se of 292 was the result of an asymmetric supernova explosion , where less energy was channeled into that direction than the rest of the snr .",
    "the lack of extensive [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 emission in the se of 292 may indicate that the snr is less evolved in that direction , providing further evidence in favor of the asymmetric explosion picture .      as shown in figure  4 ,",
    "the o - rich spur and the runaway fmk in 292 are detected in the 15 - 25 @xmath0 continuum image extracted from the irs datacube of 292 .",
    "the presence of such continuum indicates that dust grains exist within the ejecta . to investigate this possibility further , we extracted irs spectra of the ruanway fmk , using a circular region centered on the knot .",
    "we subtracted sky emission using an identically sized region located approximately 10 radially inward from the fmk ( marked by the small cyan circle in figure  3 ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure  7 .",
    "the sky spectrum shows emission features from intervening photodissociation region ( pdr ) and h  ii regions along the line of sight to 292 : pah emission at 16.4 and 17.0 @xmath0 , as well as h@xmath15 s(1 ) 17.1 @xmath0 and h@xmath15 28.2 @xmath0 emission .",

    "the spectral characteristics of this feature are very similar to those of the spur ( ghavamian 2009 ) , and similar to what is seen in the radiatively shocked o - rich ejecta of 1e0102@xmath2872.3 ( sandstrom 2009 ; rho 2009 ) .",
    "this strengthens the case for sn dust ( mg@xmath15sio@xmath26/mgsio@xmath27 ) in the ejecta of 292 .",
    "it also dispels the possibility raised by lee ( 2009 ) that oversubtraction of the overlying dust continuum was responsible for the lack of significant 24 - 36 @xmath0 continuum emission in our earlier irs spectrum of the spur ( ghavamian 2009 ) .",
    "the elongated structure extending southward of 292 in the 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 images exhibits a very interesting morphology .",
    "it was first noted by lee ( 2009 ) in their akari observations of 292 , who referred to feature as a ` narrow tail ' .",
    "it appears to be connected to the streamers of o - rich ejecta extending south of the spur ( seen in the [ o  iii ] image in figure  1 , and in the 24 @xmath0 mips image ) .",
    "however , the narrow tail has no x - ray counterpart , and no corresponding optical emission .",
    "the 70/24 ratio ( region 19 in table  1 ) is 4.2 , which indicates cold dust .",
    "the background - subtracted irs spectrum of the narrow tail is shown in the right panel of figure  7 .",
    "the location used for the estimating the background contribution to the narrow tail spectrum is marked by the elongated cyan region in figure  3 .",
    "the spectrum of the narrow tail in figure  7 is consistent with cold dust  it peaks beyond the irs bandpass .",
    "these colors are similar to ir cirrus , rather than dust heated by uv from the core collapse explosion .",
    "dwek & arendt ( 2008 ) presented an analysis of light echoes near cas a , and found that the 70/24 ratios of these echoes was significantly smaller than seen in normal ir cirrus , an indication that the dust had been significantly heated .",
    "dwek found that graphite dust was required to explain the emission , finding that the dust temperature ( @xmath5175 k ) indicated very strong heating from incident uv radiation , rather than optical photons from the sn . in the case of 292 ,",
    "the colors of the elongated structure indicate much colder dust ( @xmath725  k ) , hence heating by uv emission from the sn that produced 292 is highly unlikely .",
    "there is weak [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 emission from the sky - subtracted spectrum of the narrow tail , as well as faint [ fe  ii]+[o  iv ] and a hint of @xmath37 s(0,0 ) at 28.2 @xmath0 .",
    "this is all consistent with a clump of cold interstellar cloud material ( ir cirrus ) which has been heated by ambient stellar uv light .",
    "we conclude that despite the very suggestive morphology and alignment of this feature with the streamers of o - rich material emanating from the spur , it appears to be a chance alignment between an interstellar cloud and the elongation axis of the o - rich streamers .",

    "these observations complement the existing akari study of 292 ( lee 2009 ) .",
    "our results are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the mips data show that most of the filaments seen in the x - rays along the periphery of the snr , as well as the band of equatorial material stretching across its middle , emit dust continuum emission in the mid - ir .",
    "the irs mapping data of the filaments and clumps show broad - band , rising continua between 15 @xmath0 and 40 @xmath0 , a clear signature of shock - heated dust .",
    "the shapes of the dust continua are consistent with a mixture of graphite and silicate dust , as is observed in the non - radiative blast waves of other snrs ( e.g , williams 2011 ) .",
    "the mips 70/24 flux ratio varies significantly ( 1.5 @xmath7 @xmath38 @xmath7 5 ) between the blast wave , equatorial belt and the southwestern clumps .",
    "these variations primarily reflect differences in dust temperature around 292 , and plots of the 70/24 ratio versus x - ray surface brightness are consistent with variations in csm density inferred from x - ray observations ( lee 2010 ) .",
    "the 70/24 @xmath0 ratios are also consistent with predictions from dusty shock models ( dwek , foster & vancura 1996 ) with shock speeds and preshock densities matching those predicted by the x - ray observations of lee ( 2010 ) .    \\3 .",
    "no mid - ir emission ( either lines or continuum ) is detected from the non - radiative , x - ray emitting ejecta seen in the images 292 .",
    "the radiatively shocked o - rich ejecta are detected in the mips 24 @xmath0 image , with most of the ejecta emission in that band consisting of [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] @xmath125.9 emission . using an isolated fmk located near the southern edge of 292",
    "we have confirmed the detection of the 15 - 25 @xmath0 emission bump from the radiatively shocked o - rich ejecta ( possibly mg@xmath15sio@xmath26 or mgsio@xmath27 dust formed in the ejecta ) .",
    "continuum - subtracted emission line maps of the [ ne  iii ] @xmath115.5 and [ o  iv]+[fe  ii ] @xmath125.9 emission show a strong spatial correlation between the two , and emission in these lines is detected from both the spur and the fmks .",
    "however , neither of these two structures is detected in the continuum - subtracted [ si  ii ] @xmath134.8 maps of 292 .",
    "save for a localized blob of [ si  ii ] emission near the inner edge of the spur , no obvious emission from this species is seen elsewhere in the snr . since the entire southeastern portion of 292 is also deficient in si line emission in the x - rays ( park 2007 ) , the lack of both ir and x - ray emission from si in the spur indicates that most of the si is unshocked in the southeastern quadrant of 292 and that save for the [ si  ii]-emitting blob , the reverse shock has not yet penetrated most of the si - rich ejecta in the southeast .",

    "<S> we present mid - infrared continuum and emission line images of the galactic oxygen - rich supernova remnant ( snr ) 292 , acquired using the mips and irs instruments on the _ space telescope_. the mips 24 @xmath0 and 70 @xmath0 images of 292 are dominated by continuum emission from a network of filaments encircling the snr . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of the snr , as seen in the mid - infrared , resembles that seen in x - rays with the x - ray observatory . </S>",
    "<S> most of the mid - infrared emission in the mips images is produced by circumstellar dust heated in the non - radiative shocks around 292 , confirming the results of earlier mid - ir observations with akari . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to emission from hot dust , we have also mapped atomic line emission between 14 @xmath0 and 36 @xmath0 using irs spectral maps . </S>",
    "<S> the line emission is primarily associated with the bright oxygen - rich optical knots , but is also detected from fast - moving knots of ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm our earlier detection of 15 - 25 @xmath0 emission characteristic of magnesium silicate dust in spectra of the radiatively shocked ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we do not detect silicon line emission from any of the radiatively shocked ejecta in the southeast of the snr , possibly because that the reverse shock has not yet penetrated most of the si - rich ejecta in that region . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that 292 is less evolved in the southeast than the rest of the snr , and may be further evidence in favor of an asymmetric sn explosion as proposed in recent x - ray studies of 292 . </S>"
