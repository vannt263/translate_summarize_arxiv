    "stellar atmospheres are open systems and thus can not be in thermodynamic equilibrium ( te ) .",
    "the `` local thermodynamic equilibrium '' ( lte ) is a working hypothesis which assumes te not for the atmosphere as a whole but for small volume elements . as a consequence ,",
    "the atomic population numbers are depending only on the local ( electron ) temperature and electron density via the saha - boltzmann equations .",
    "computing models by replacing the saha - boltzmann equations by the rate equations ( statistical equilibrium ) are called non - lte ( or nlte ) models .",
    "nlte calculations are more costly than lte calculations , however , it is hard to predict if nlte effects are important in a specific problem",
    ". generally , nlte effects are large at high temperatures and low densities , which implies intense radiation fields hence frequent radiative processes and less frequent particle collisions which tend to enforce lte conditions .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the classical model atmosphere problem , i.e.  the solution of the radiation transfer equations assuming hydrostatic , radiative and statistical equilibrium .",
    "the numerical problem going from lte to realistic nlte models has been solved only recently and is the topic of this paper .",
    "this was achieved by the development of new numerical techniques for model construction and on the availability of atomic data for many species .",
    "the replacement of the saha - boltzmann equations by the atomic rate equations requires a different numerical solution technique , otherwise metal opacities can not be accounted for at all .",
    "such techniques were developed with big success during the last decade , triggered by important papers by cannon ( 1973 ) and scharmer ( 1981 ) .",
    "the accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) is at the heart of of this development .",
    "combined with statistical methods we are finally able to compute metal line blanketed nlte models with a very high level of sophistication .",
    "we assume plane - parallel geometry , which is well justified for most stars because the atmospheres are thin compared to the stellar radius . the only parameters which characterize uniquely such an atmosphere are the effective temperature ( ) , which is a measure for the amount of energy transported through the atmosphere per unit area and time , the surface gravity ( @xmath0 ) , and the chemical composition . to construct model atmospheres we have to solve simultaneously a set of equations that is highly coupled and non - linear . because of the coupling , no equation is determining uniquely a single quantity ",
    "all equations determine a number of state parameters .",
    "however , each of them is usually thought of as determining a particular quantity .",
    "these equations are :    * the radiation transfer equations which are solved for the ( angular ) mean intensities @xmath1 , on a pre - chosen frequency grid comprising @xmath2 points .",
    "the formal solution is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the source function ( eq.[source ] ) .",
    "although @xmath5 is written as an operator , one may think of @xmath5 as a _ process _ of obtaining the mean intensity from the source function . * the hydrostatic equation which determines the total particle density @xmath6 . *",
    "the radiative equilibrium equation from which the temperature @xmath7 follows . * the particle conservation equation , determining the electron density @xmath8 . * the statistical equilibrium equations which are solved for the population densities @xmath9 of the atomic nlte levels . * the definition equation for a fictitious massive particle density @xmath10 which is introduced for a convenient representation of the solution procedure .",
    "this set of equations has to be solved at each point @xmath11 of a grid comprising @xmath12 depth points .",
    "thus we are looking for solution vectors @xmath13 the complete linearization ( cl ) method ( auer & mihalas 1969 ) solves this set by linearizing the equations with respect to all variables .",
    "the basic advantage of the ali ( or `` operator splitting '' ) method is that it allows to eliminate at the outset the explicit occurrence of the mean intensities @xmath14 from the solution scheme by expressing these variables by the current , yet to be determined , occupation densities and temperature .",
    "this is accomplished by an iteration procedure which may be written as ( suppressing indices indicating depth and frequency dependency of variables ) : @xmath15 this means that the actual mean intensity at any iteration step @xmath16 is computed by applying an approximate lambda operator ( alo ) @xmath17 on the actual ( thermal ) source function @xmath18 plus a correction term that is computed from quantities known from the previous iteration step .",
    "this correction term includes the exact lambda operator @xmath5 which guarantees the exact solution of the radiation transfer problem in the limit of convergence : @xmath3 .",
    "the use of @xmath5 in eq.[ali ] only indicates that a formal solution of the transfer equation is performed but in our application the operator is not constructed explicitly .",
    "instead we employ the feautrier solution scheme ( mihalas 1978 ) or a short characteristic method ( olson & kunasz 1987 ) to solve the transfer equation that is set up as a differential equation .",
    "the resulting set of equations for the reduced solution vectors @xmath19 is of course still non - linear .",
    "the solution is obtained by linearization and iteration which is performed either with a usual newton - raphson iteration or other methods ( sect.[kanto ] ) .",
    "first model atmosphere calculations with the ali method were performed by werner ( 1986 ) .",
    "another advantage of the ali method is that explicit depth coupling of the solution vectors eq.[psi1 ] through the transfer equation can be avoided if one restricts to diagonal ( i.e.  local ) alos .",
    "then the solution vectors eq.[psi2 ] are independent from each other and the solution procedure within one iteration step of eq.[ali ] is much more straightforward .",
    "depth coupling is provided by the correction term that involves the exact solution of the transfer equation . the hydrostatic equation which also gives an explicit depth coupling ,",
    "may be taken out of the set of equations and can  as experience shows ",
    "be solved in between two iteration steps of eq.[ali ]",
    ". then full advantage of a local alo can be taken .",
    "the linearized system may be written as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the current estimate for the solution vector at depth @xmath11 and @xmath22 is the correction vector to be computed .",
    "using a tri - diagonal @xmath17 operator the resulting system for @xmath22 is  like in the classical cl scheme  of block tri - diagonal form coupling each depth point @xmath11 to its nearest neighbors @xmath23 : @xmath24 the quantities @xmath25 are ( @xmath26 ) matrices where @xmath27 is the total number of physical variables , i.e. , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the residual error in the equations .",
    "the solution is obtained by the standard feautrier scheme .",
    "as already mentioned , the system eq.[tri ] breaks into @xmath12 independent equations @xmath30 ( @xmath31 )",
    "when a local @xmath17 operator is used . the additional numerical effort to set up the subdiagonal matrices and matrix multiplications in the tri - diagonal case is outweighed by the faster global convergence of the ali cycle , accomplished by the explicit depth coupling in the linearization procedure ( werner 1989 ) .",
    "the principal advantage of the ali over the cl method becomes clear at this point .",
    "each matrix inversion necessary to solve eq.[tri ] requires @xmath32 operations whereas in the cl method @xmath33 operations are needed . since the number of frequency points @xmath2 is much larger than the number of levels @xmath34 , the matrix inversion in the cl approach",
    "is dominated by @xmath2 .",
    "recent developments concern the problem that the total number of atomic levels tractable in nlte with the ali method described so far is restricted to the order of 250 , from experience with our model atmosphere code pro2 .",
    "this limit is a consequence of the non - linearity of the equations , and in order to overcome it , measures must be taken in order to achieve a linear system whose numerical solution is much more stable .",
    "such a pre - conditioning procedure has been first applied in the ali context by werner & husfeld ( 1985 ) using the core saturation method ( rybicki 1972 ) .",
    "more advanced work achieves linearity by replacing the @xmath5 operator with the @xmath35 operator ( and by judiciously considering some populations as `` old '' and some as `` new '' ones within an ali step ) which is formally defined by writing : @xmath36 where the total opacity @xmath37 ( as defined in sect.[opa ] ) is calculated from the previous ali cycle .",
    "the advantage is that the emissivity @xmath38 ( sect.[opa ] ) is linear in the populations , whereas the source function @xmath39 is not .",
    "hence the new operator @xmath35 gives the solution of the transfer problem by acting on a linear function .",
    "this idea is based on rybicki & hummer ( 1991 ) who applied it to the line formation problem , i.e.restricting the set of equations to the transfer and rate equations and regarding the atmospheric structure as fixed .",
    "hauschildt ( 1993 ) and hauschildt & baron ( 1999 ) generalized it to solve the full model atmosphere problem .",
    "in addition , splitting the set of statistical equations and solving it separately for each chemical element means that now many hundreds of levels per species are tractable in nlte .",
    "we give a short overview of the basic equations to be solved .",
    "more detailed presentations may be found in werner & dreizler ( 1999 ) or werner ( 2003 ) .",
    "any numerical method requires a formal solution ( i.e.  atmospheric structure already given ) of the radiation transfer problem .",
    "the radiation transfer at any particular depth point can be described by the following equation , formally written for positive and negative @xmath40 ( which is the cosine of the angle between direction of propagation and outward directed normal to the surface ) separately , i.e.  for inward and for outward directional intensities @xmath41 with frequency @xmath42 : @xmath43.\\ ] ] @xmath44 is the optical depth ( which can be defined via the column mass @xmath45 that is used in the other structural equations by @xmath46 , with the mass density @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 is the local source function . introducing the feautrier intensity",
    "@xmath49 we obtain the second - order form ( mihalas 1978 ) : @xmath50.\\ ] ] we may separate the thomson emissivity term ( scattering from free electrons , assumed coherent , with cross - section @xmath51 ) from the source function so that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ratio of thermal emissivity to total opacity ( sect.[opa ] ) : @xmath54 . since the mean intensity is the angular integral over the feautrier intensity the transfer equation becomes @xmath55 thomson scattering complicates the situation by explicit angle coupling .",
    "assuming complete frequency redistribution in spectral lines , no explicit frequency coupling occurs so that the parallel solution for all frequencies enables a very efficient vectorization on the computer .",
    "for each atomic level @xmath56 the rate equation describes the equilibrium of rates into and rates out of this level : @xmath57 the rate coefficients @xmath58 have radiative and collisional components : @xmath59 . the radiative downward rate for example is given by : @xmath60 photon cross - sections",
    "are denoted by @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is the boltzmann lte population ratio .",
    "the computation of collisional rates is generally dependent on the specific ion or even transition .",
    "the rate equation for the highest level of a given chemical species is redundant .",
    "it is replaced by the abundance definition equation .",
    "summation over all levels usually includes not only nlte levels but also levels which are treated in lte , according to the specification in the model atom . denoting the number of ionization stages of species @xmath63 with @xmath64 , the number of nlte and lte levels per ion with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , and the number fraction of species @xmath63 with @xmath67 , we can write : @xmath68 = y_k ( n - n_e ) .\\ ] ]      we close the system of statistical equations by invoking charge conservation .",
    "we denote the total number of chemical species with @xmath69 , the charge of ion @xmath70 with @xmath71 ( in units of the electron charge ) and write : @xmath72=n_e .\\ ] ]      we introduce a vector comprising the occupation numbers of all nlte levels , @xmath73 @xmath74 . then the statistical equilibrium equation is written as : @xmath75 the gross structure of the rate matrix @xmath76 is of block matrix form , because transitions between levels occur within one ionization stage or to the ground state of the next ion .",
    "the structure is complicated by ionizations into excited levels and by the abundance definition and charge conservation equations which give additional non - zero elements in the corresponding lines of @xmath77 .",
    "radiative equilibrium can be enforced by adjusting the temperature stratification either during the linearization procedure or in between ali iterations . in the former case",
    "a linear combination of two different formulations can be used and in the latter case the classical unsld - lucy temperature correction procedure ( lucy 1964 ) is utilized .",
    "the latter is particularly interesting , because it allows to exploit the blocked form of the rate coefficient matrix .",
    "this will enable an economic block - by - block solution followed by a subsequent unsld - lucy temperature correction step .",
    "on the other side , however , this correction procedure may decelerate the global convergence behavior of the ali iteration .",
    "the two forms of expressing the radiative equilibrium condition follow from the postulation that the energy emitted by a volume element per unit time is equal to the absorbed energy per unit time ( integral form ) : @xmath78 this formulation is equivalent to invoking flux constancy throughout the atmosphere ( differential form ) involving the nominal flux @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the variable eddington factor , defined as @xmath82 and computed from the feautrier intensity @xmath83 ( eq.[udef ] ) after the formal solution .",
    "the differential form is more accurate at large depths , while the integral form behaves numerically better at small depths . instead of arbitrarily selecting that depth in the atmosphere where we switch from one formulation to the other",
    ", we use a linear combination of both constraint equations which guarantees a smooth transition with depth , based on physical grounds : @xmath84 for details on this equation and on our implementation of the unsld - lucy procedure see dreizler ( 2003 ) .",
    "the total pressure @xmath85 comprises gas , radiation and turbulent pressures , so that we write the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium as : @xmath86 with boltzmann s constant @xmath63 and the turbulent velocity @xmath87 .",
    "the hydrostatic equation may either be solved simultaneously with all other equations or separately in between iterations .",
    "the overall convergence behavior is usually the same in both cases .",
    "if taken into the linearization scheme and a local @xmath17 operator is used then , like in the case of the radiative equilibrium equation , explicit depth coupling enters via the depth derivative @xmath88 .",
    "again , solution of the linearized equations has to proceed inwards starting at the outer boundary .",
    "the total particle density @xmath6 is the sum of electron density plus the population density of all atomic states , lte and nlte levels : @xmath89 .\\ ] ] a fictitious massive particle density @xmath10 is defined by : @xmath90 .\\ ] ] the mass of a chemical species in amu is denoted by @xmath91 .",
    "introducing the mass of a hydrogen atom @xmath92 , we then may simply write for the material density @xmath93      thermal opacity and emissivity are made up by radiative bound - bound , bound - free and free - free transitions . for each species we compute and sum up : @xmath94 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the total opacity includes thomson scattering , i.e.@xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97 denotes the cross - section for photoionization from level @xmath56 of ion @xmath70 into level @xmath63 of ion @xmath98 .",
    "the double summation over the bound - free continua takes into account the possibility that a particular level may be ionized into more than one level of the next high ion .",
    "the source function used for the approximate radiation transfer is @xmath99 , thus , excludes thomson scattering . for the exact formal solution of course",
    ", the total opacity @xmath37 in the expression eq.[source ] includes the thomson term ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "in all constraint equations described above the mean intensities @xmath101 are substituted by the approximate radiation field eq.[ali ] in order to eliminate these variables from the solution vector eq.[psi1 ] . in principle",
    "the alo may be of arbitrary form as long as the iteration procedure converges . in practice",
    "however an optimum choice is desired in order to achieve convergence with a minimum amount of iteration steps .    in the case of diagonal ( local ) lambda operators the mean intensity @xmath102 at a particular depth @xmath11 in the current iteration step",
    "is computed solely from the local source function @xmath103 and a correction term @xmath104 , the latter involving the source functions ( of all depths ) from the previous iteration .",
    "dropping the iteration count and introducing indices denoting depth points we can rewrite eq.[ali ] : @xmath105 in the discrete form we now think of @xmath17 as a matrix acting on a vector whose elements comprise the source functions of all depths . then @xmath106 is the diagonal element of the @xmath17 matrix corresponding to depth point @xmath11 .",
    "writing @xmath107 we have a purely local expression for the mean intensity : @xmath108 much better convergence is obtained if the mean intensity is computed not only from the local source function but also from the source function of the neighboring depths points .",
    "then the matrix representation of @xmath17 is of tri - diagonal form and we may write : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 represent the upper and lower subdiagonal elements of @xmath17 and @xmath112 the source functions at the adjacent depths .",
    "we emphasize again that the actual source functions in eq.[trij ] are computed from the actual population densities and temperature which are unknown .",
    "we therefore have a non - linear set of equations which is solved by either a newton - raphson iteration or other techniques , resulting in the solution of a tri - diagonal linear equation of the form eq.[tri ] .",
    "it was shown in olson ( 1986 ) that the elements of the optimum @xmath17 matrix are given by the corresponding elements of the exact @xmath5 matrix .",
    "the complete set of non - linear equations for a single iteration step eq.[ali ] comprises at each depth the equations for statistical , radiative , and hydrostatic equilibrium and the particle conservation equation . for the numerical solution",
    "we introduce discrete depth and frequency grids .",
    "the equations are then linearized and solved by a suitable iterative scheme .",
    "explicit angle dependency of the radiation field is not required here and consequently eliminated by the use of variable eddington factors .",
    "angle dependency is only considered in the formal solution of the transfer equation .",
    "a depth grid is set up and we start from a gray approximation computing a lte continuum model using the unsld - lucy temperature correction procedure .",
    "depth points ( typical number is 90 ) are set equidistantly on a logarithmic ( rosseland ) optical depth scale .",
    "our nlte code uses the column mass as an independent depth variable .",
    "the frequency grid is established based upon the atomic data input file .",
    "frequency points are set blue- and redward of each absorption edge and for each spectral line .",
    "gaps are filled in by setting continuum points . finally , the quadrature weights are computed .",
    "frequency integrals appearing e.g. in eq.[combi ] are replaced by quadrature sums and differential quotients involving depth derivatives by difference quotients .",
    "all variables @xmath113 are replaced by @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes a small perturbation of @xmath113 .",
    "terms not linear in these perturbations are neglected .",
    "the perturbations are expressed by perturbations of the basic variables : @xmath116      as described in sect.[eins2 ] the linearized equations have a tri - diagonal block - matrix form , see eq.[tri ] .",
    "inversion of the grand matrix ( @xmath117 sized @xmath118 , i.e.  about @xmath119 in typical applications ) is performed with a block - gaussian elimination scheme , which means that our iteration of the non - linear equations represents a multi - dimensional newton - raphson method . the problem is structurally simplified when explicit depth coupling is avoided by the use of a local alo , however , the numerical effort is not much reduced , because in both cases the main effort lies with the inversion of matrices sized @xmath26 .",
    "the newton - raphson iteration involves two numerically expensive steps , first setting up the jacobian ( comprising @xmath25 ) and then inverting it .",
    "additionally , the matrix inversions necessary to solve eq.[tri ] limit their size to about @xmath120 because otherwise numerical accuracy is lost .",
    "two variants recently introduced in stellar atmosphere calculations are able to improve both , numerical accuracy and , most of all , computational speed .",
    "broyden s ( 1965 ) variant belongs to the family of quasi - newton methods and it was first used in model atmosphere calculations in dreizler & werner ( 1991 ) , hamann ( 1991 ) and koesterke ( 1992 ) .",
    "it avoids the repeated set - up of the jacobian by the use of an update formula . on top of this , it also gives an update formula for the _ inverse _ jacobian .",
    "another variant , the kantorovich method was introduced into model atmosphere calculations by hubeny & lanz ( 1992 ) .",
    "this method simply keeps fixed the jacobian during the linearization cycle and it is surprisingly stable .",
    "despite the capacity increase for the nlte treatment of model atmosphere problems by introducing the ali method combined with pre - conditioning techniques , the blanketing by millions of lines from the iron group elements arising from transitions between some @xmath121 levels could only be attacked with the help of statistical methods .",
    "these have been introduced into nlte model atmosphere work by anderson ( 1989 ) . at the outset",
    ", model atoms are constructed by combining many thousands of levels into a relatively small number of superlevels which can be treated with ali ( or other ) methods .",
    "then , in order to reduce the computational effort , two approaches were developed which vastly decrease the number of frequency points ( and hence the number of transfer equations to be solved ) to describe properly the complex frequency dependence of the opacity .",
    "these two approaches have their roots in lte modeling techniques , where for the same reason statistical methods are applied for the opacity treatment : the opacity distribution function ( odf ) and opacity sampling ( os ) approaches .",
    "both are based on the circumstance that the opacity ( in the lte approximation ) is a function of two only local thermodynamic quantities .",
    "roughly speaking , each opacity source can be written in terms of a population density and a photon cross - section for the respective radiative transition : @xmath122 . in lte",
    "the population follows from the saha - boltzmann equations , hence @xmath123 .",
    "the os and odf methods use such pre - tabulated ( on a very fine frequency mesh ) @xmath124 during the model atmosphere calculations .",
    "the nlte situation is more complicated , because pre - tabulation of opacities is not useful .",
    "the population densities at any depth now also depend explicitly on the radiation field ( via the rate equations which substitute the te saha - boltzmann statistics ) and thus on the populations in each other depth of the atmosphere . as a consequence , the os and odf methods",
    "are not applied to opacity tabulations , but on tabulations of the photon cross - sections @xmath125 .",
    "these do depend on local quantities only , e.g. line broadening by stark and doppler effects is calculated from @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the nlte case",
    "the cross - section takes over the role which the opacity played in the lte case . more details on this topic can be found in werner & dreizler ( 1999 ) .    our strategy is the following . before any model atmosphere calculation",
    "is started , the atomic data are prepared by constructing superlevels , and the cross - sections for superlines . then these cross - sections are either sampled on a coarse frequency grid or odfs are constructed .",
    "these data are put into the model atom which is read by the model code .",
    "the construction of metal line blanketed models in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium under nlte conditions was the last and long - standing problem of classical model atmosphere theory and it is finally solved with a high degree of sophistication .",
    "the essential milestones for this development , starting from the pioneering work of auer & mihalas ( 1969 ) are :    * introduction of the accelerated lambda iteration ( ali , or `` operator splitting '' methods ) , based upon early work by cannon ( 1973 ) and scharmer ( 1981 ) .",
    "first ali model atmospheres were constructed by werner ( 1986 ) . *",
    "introduction of statistical approaches to treat the iron group elements in nlte by anderson ( 1989 ) .",
    "* linear formulation of the statistical equations ( rybicki & hummer 1991 , hauschildt 1993 ) .",
