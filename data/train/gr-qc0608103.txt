    "the existence of gravitational waves ( gw ) , predicted in the theory of general relativity , has long been verified ` indirectly ' through the observations of hulse and taylor .",
    "the inspiral of the members of the binary pulsar system named after them has been successfully accounted for in terms of the back - reaction due to the radiated gw @xcite .",
    "however , detecting such waves with man - made ` antennas ' has not been possible so far .",
    "nevertheless , this problem has received a lot of attention in the past several years , especially , due to the arrival of laser - interferometric detectors , which are expected to have sensitivities close to that required for detecting such waves @xcite .",
    "the space mission lisa @xcite is also planned by the nasa and esa to detect low frequency gw .",
    "the significance of the direct detection of gw lies , not only in the opening of an entirely new window into observational astronomy ; it further promises to place our present theories of gravitation on an entirely different foundation from that which currently exists .",
    "strong field gravity has never been directly observed and experimental verification of the predictions of general relativity are very much needed .",
    "gw detection will undoubtedly be the most exciting development in experimental general relativity since the theory s birth in 1915 .    because several detectors will take data simultaneously",
    ", it is advantageous to perform a multi - detector search for gw signals .",
    "a multi - detector search would ( i ) improve our confidence in detection of a gw event if a candidate event is registered ; ( ii ) provide useful directional information on the gw event if the detectors are sufficiently separated in location , that is , at large geographical separations ; ( iii ) provide polarization information if they are differently oriented .",
    "the information mentioned in ( ii ) and ( iii ) is degenerate in a single detector .",
    "the response of a network to a gw is phase coherent . by ` correcting ' for the phase from the data of different detectors , and the time - delay between detectors ( this amounts to bringing the detectors to the same site and with the same orientation ) , one can combine the data phase coherently .",
    "that this was achievable was shown in several works @xcite . here",
    "the gw source was the well studied inspiraling compact binary .    in this paper",
    "we compare two different multi - detector detection strategies the coherent versus the coincident .",
    "the gw source we choose is the inspiraling binary because the phase of the wave can be sufficiently accurately computed ; the phase of the wave has been modeled to the 3.5 post - newtonian ( pn ) order @xcite which means that the phase of the wave is accurate to about a cycle in a wave train of @xmath0 cycles for typical stellar mass binary inspirals .",
    "secondly , in the context of gw detectors , it is of great astrophysical significance @xcite .",
    "finn @xcite has performed similar analysis with a sinusoidal signal .",
    "however , our analysis goes further in that we consider a gw signal of astrophysical importance and our analysis uses template banks of inspirals to compare the two strategies .",
    "the coherent search strategy uses the maximum likelihood method where a _ single _",
    "likelihood ratio for the entire network is constructed - that is the network is treated as a single detector - this is similar to aperture synthesis carried out , for example , by radio astronomers .",
    "the likelihood method combines the data from a network of detectors in a _ phase coherent _ manner to yield a single statistic which is optimal in the maximum likelihood sense .",
    "this statistic is then compared with the threshold determined by the false alarm rate that we are prepared to tolerate .",
    "if the statistic crosses the threshold , then a detection is announced .",
    "note that a _ single _",
    "likelihood ratio is computed and a _ single _ threshold applied in this type of search .    on the other hand ,",
    "the coincidence approach involves separately filtering the signal in each detector , applying two separate thresholds corresponding to each detector and preparing two event lists determined by the crossings",
    ". then the event lists are matched .",
    "if the estimated parameters for the events lie in a reasonable neighborhood in the parameter space of signals , a coincident detection is registered - if the differences in the estimated parameters lie within certain bounds - that is , the parameters of the events must lie within a certain ` window ' of the parameter space . a coincidence search for inspiraling binaries with real data",
    "has already been performed in many cases @xcite .",
    "the debate between the coherent and coincident strategies has existed in the community ever since the coherent strategy was formulated .",
    "while the coherent strategy involves more computational costs than the coincident strategy , we show in this paper for the simple case of two identical detectors in the same location and with same orientation that the performance of the coherent strategy is superior to that of the coincidence strategy - the false dismissal is considerably less for the coherent as compared with the coincident at the same false alarm .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that for simplicity we have taken the detectors to be co - aligned ; we expect the coherent strategy to perform better in the case of non - aligned detectors than its competitor . in order to decide on the performance between the two strategies",
    ", we plot the false dismissal versus false alarm curves - the _ receiver operating characteristic _ ( roc ) curves .",
    "we use the initial ligo ( ligo i ) noise curve @xcite in our calculations and assume gaussian stationary noise in our simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly review the signal in a network of detectors , the post - newtonian inspiral waveform and also the maximum likelihood analysis . in section iii",
    "we obtain analytical results of false alarm and false dismissal probabilities for both coherent and coincident strategies . in this section",
    "we also consider the case of correlated noise between the detectors .",
    "this case would be of particular significance to the two ligo detectors at hanford and other similar future detector topologies elsewhere envisaged . in section",
    "iv we perform simulations .",
    "the simulations are performed in order(i ) to determine the number of independent templates and , ( ii ) to determine the size of the parameter window for the coincidence case .",
    "simulations are necessary because at low snr @xmath1 , the fisher information matrix gives poor estimates of the errors in parameters and therefore grossly undersizes the window .",
    "further , simulations are also performed in order to plot the roc curves which validate our analytical results . in section",
    "v we summarize the results and describe future directions .",
    "in this section , we describe the necessary background and notation in order to make the paper self contained . generic time domain functions @xmath2",

    "the dependence of the response on the angles is best given by defining two frames :    _ wave frame @xmath5 _ : the gravitational wave travels along the positive @xmath6 direction and @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the axes of polarization in such a way that a right - handed coordinate system is formed .",

    "we just need one such frame because the detectors have the same orientation .",

    "the noise is however different in each detector .",
    "but since we assume identical noise psds and also assumed stationarity of the noise , the noise random variables satisfy the statistical property : n^i ( f ) n^*_i(f ) = s_h ( f ) ( f - f ) , [ psd ] where , the angular brackets denote ensemble average .    if the detectors have uncorrelated noise , @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand , if the detectors have correlated noise , then we may assume : n^1 ( f ) n^*_2(f ) = ( f ) s_h ( f ) ( f - f ) , [ noisecorr ] where @xmath73 is real and frequency dependent .",
    "in the time domain , we assume @xmath73 as a function of @xmath74 .",
    "this assumption implies also stationarity in the correlated noise .",
    "the quantity @xmath73 is , in general , a function of frequency , because different physical mechanisms generating noise are operative in different frequency regimes .",
    "consequently , the noise correlation is frequency dependent .",
    "in reality , there are several complications : the noise generated by a particular mechanism may drift in frequency with time and/or the @xmath73 may be dependent on the amplitude of noise , because of non - linear effects , etc .",
    "it is not easy to deal with such generic cases .",
    "however , when the correlation of noise is not very large , it is expected that the simple correlation model ( [ noisecorr ] ) we adopt is adequate .    if @xmath75 , the noise in the two detectors is uncorrelated ; on the other hand if @xmath76 then the noise is perfectly correlated .",
    "the cases of physical interest lie in between these two extremes .",

    "this section serves as a prelude to the next section , section iv , where we obtain the roc curves for each strategy .",
    "as mentioned before , these curves are obtained by plotting the false dismissal rate ( or equivalently the detection probability ) versus the false alarm probability for a given strategy .",
    "a fair comparison of the strategies is obtained by plotting the roc curves for each such strategy .",

    "a comparison of the performance of the strategies is drawn pairwise between cases a. 1 . and b. 1 , and a. 2 and b. 2 .",
    "in this section we obtain useful analytic formulae for the false alarm and false dismissal probabilities .",
    "we find that the probabilities are obtained in terms of certain parameters , the number of independent templates @xmath83 and the size of the parameter window @xmath84 , which are difficult to compute analytically - we elaborate on these issues later in the text .",
    "however these quantities can be determined numerically via simulations .",
    "we pin down these parameters later in section iv so that the relevant probabilities are fully determined .",
    "only then the roc curves can be plotted for each strategy .      in the coherent strategy ,",
    "the data from different detectors are combined phase coherently so that the network operates effectively as a single detector .",
    "the maximum likelihood network statistic for coincident and co - aligned detectors has already been worked out in @xcite for the case of uncorrelated noise .",
    "the maximum likelihood statistics incorporates automatically the phase of the signal and results in the coherent statistic .",
    "the maximum likelihood approach tends to outperform any other adhoc test and we follow this approach for the case at hand .",
    "a detailed discussion on this issue , pertaining to aligned and misaligned detectors has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "the coherent network statistics for this case is given by :    @xmath85    where the @xmath77 are the complex correlations of the two detectors @xmath86 .",
    "although the statistic @xmath87 has the advantage that it is proportional to the amplitude of the gw , the square of @xmath87 has simpler form of the probability distribution if the noise in the detectors is gaussian and stationary .",
    "thus we define : @xmath88 .",
    "\\label{stat2}\\ ] ] equivalently , @xmath89 can also be used to decide the presence or absence of a signal .",
    "our goal is to obtain the false alarm and detection probabilities @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively for the detection strategy .",
    "the false alarm probability is obtained in two steps : we obtain the probability in the single template case ( for instance , when the signal parameters are known ) and then deduce the probability where one must search over the parameter space .",
    "consider first the single template case :    note that when the noise is uncorrelated , @xmath80 and @xmath92 are mutually independent gaussian variables distributed standard normal ; that each have mean zero and standard deviation unity .",
    "this is when there is no signal present in the data . from this",
    "it follows that the quantities @xmath93 and @xmath94 are also two independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "then @xmath89 which is the sum of squares of these two random variables has the probability density function ( pdf ) given by : @xmath95    given a threshold @xmath96 , the statistic @xmath89 exceeds the threshold @xmath96 with the probability : @xmath97 @xmath98 is the false alarm probability for one template .",
    "normally the threshold @xmath96 is chosen sufficiently high so that few false alarms occur during the observation period .",
    "however , the parameters of the signal are not known a priori and one must scan the data with a bank of templates .",
    "filtering the data through all the templates in the bank enormously increases the false alarm rate .",
    "typically , the templates densely cover the parameter space in order to minimize the chance of a signal being missed out .",
    "we have already briefly described such a template bank in section ii .",
    "b. for the spinless inspiral the template bank comprises of templates in the parameter space spanned by the parameters @xmath99 .",
    "however , when determining the false alarm rate , the parameter @xmath16 is as important , although one uses the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm to efficiently scan over the parameter @xmath16 and excludes it from the standard template bank ; one effectively also has templates in @xmath16 contributing to the false alarm rate .",
    "if the number of templates in the three parameter extended bank ( which includes @xmath16 also as a parameter besides @xmath39 ) are @xmath100 and if they all produced independent filtered outputs and if the false alarm probability for a single template is small , then the false alarm rate for the extended bank is just that of the single template multiplied by the factor @xmath100 .",
    "however , one finds that , because the templates are closely packed , the filtered outputs are strongly correlated .",
    "the dense coverage of templates results both from the high sampling rate in @xmath16 as well as the high minimal match chosen . because of the correlations the false alarms are substantially reduced .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the effect of the correlations is to effectively reduce the number of independent random variables .",
    "we find in section iv from simulations that this effective number of independent random variables @xmath83 is much less than @xmath100 .",
    "thus the false alarm probability for the template bank takes the form : @xmath101    when a signal @xmath44 with amplitude @xmath43 is present in the data @xmath82 , the means of the correlations @xmath102 are no more zero , although they are still gaussian distributed with variance unity .",
    "now the pdf of @xmath89 given by eq .",

    "transforming the distribution in @xmath89 to one in @xmath87 , one obtains approximately gaussian distribution with mean equal to @xmath106 times @xmath43 .",
    "this is the familiar @xmath107 factor of enhancement one obtains in the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) with @xmath108 independent detectors .",
    "( in fact the relevant factor 2 in eqs.([stat2 ] , [ detpr ] ) is changed to @xmath108 in the case of a network of @xmath108 independent co - aligned and co - located detectors ) . since we have assumed a network of two detectors with uncorrelated noise this factor is just @xmath106 .    by integrating @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ detpr ] ) we can easily obtain the false dismissal or the detection probability .",
    "given a threshold @xmath96 , the false dismissal probability is given by @xmath110 the detection probability @xmath91 is just @xmath111 .",
    "we now consider the case when the noise in the two detectors is correlated .",
    "for instance , the ligo detectors at hanford are in the same location and also co - aligned and therefore may share some of the noise sources ; the same physical mechanisms would introduce noise in the two detectors giving rise to correlated noise .",
    "the future planned detector , lcgt @xcite , is designed such that two interferometers with the same length are installed in the same vacuum system .",
    "we thus expect some amount of correlation in noise . here",
    "we consider the two detectors which are co - aligned and co - located with identical psds and gaussian stationary noise .",
    "we assume that the noise in the two detectors satisfies the properties given by eqs .",
    "( [ psd ] , [ noisecorr ] ) .",
    "then the quantities @xmath112 are also gaussian random variables .",

    "the new complex correlations , @xmath126 , represent the so called pseudo - detectors .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in their covariance matrix are zero .",
    "thus , we can treat them as independent variables .",
    "we also observe that the mean of @xmath127 is zero even in the presence of a signal .",
    "this suggests that we need to consider only @xmath128 to build our detection statistic .",

    "ideally , the times of arrival of the signal in the detectors should not exceed the light travel time between the detectors ; in case of the spinless inspiral we consider here , in addition to the arrival times matching , the estimated mass parameters @xmath99 must be identical . however , because of the presence of noise in the detectors , the estimates of the parameters may differ from their true values and lie in a neighbourhood of the true values .",
    "thus when deciding the consistency of the parameters of the signal one must account for the difference in estimates of the parameters in the different detectors . specifically , in the case of two detectors , a detection will be inferred if corresponding to a crossing in the first detector , there is a candidate event in the second detector whose parameters lie in the neighbourhood of the parameters of the candidate event in the first detector .",
    "we call this neighbourhood which is a subset of the parameter space , a parameter window denoted by @xmath137 . for the specific situation we consider of identical , co - aligned and co - located detectors detecting an inspiral signal , a detection is inferred ,",
    "if for a candidate event in detector 1 with estimated parameters @xmath138 , there is a candidate event in detector 2 with parameters @xmath139 which lies in the parameter window @xmath137 , a box whose vertices are given by @xmath140 .",
    "recall that a candidate event in each detector is decided by the statistic in each detector crossing its respective threshold .",

    "this assumption is not unjustified on the basis of the simulations which we perform in the next section .",
    "the question arises as to how @xmath137 is determined .",
    "one possible way is to use the fisher information matrix in order to decide @xmath137 .",
    "the fisher information matrix gives estimates of the errors in the parameters due to the noise .",
    "it also suggests that the errors scale inversely as the snr .",
    "so the size of @xmath137 depends on the snr - the higher the snr the smaller the size of @xmath137 , that is , the estimated values tend towards the true values of the parameters for large snr .",
    "however , for low snr @xmath1 or less , it has been shown that the fisher information matrix is a poor estimator of the errors ; it underestimates the errors by a large margin @xcite ( this is shown for the inspiral waveform up to 1 pn order ) .",
    "simulations show that the actual errors can be a factor 2 or even 3 larger than those predicted by the fisher information matrix .",
    "we therefore use simulations ( section iv ) to empirically determine the parameter window @xmath137 .",
    "we find that the window size depends on the snr and reduces with increasing snr .",
    "since the parameter space is sampled discretely with templates , @xmath137 contains a finite number @xmath84 independent templates . from the foregoing discussion @xmath84 is a function of the snr and decreases with increasing snr",
    "the quantity @xmath84 enters into the false alarm rate as we shall see below .",
    "since each detector registers events on its own , the detection statistic for the first detector is just @xmath141 ( without any loss of generality , we may assume any one of the two detectors to be first ) .",
    "given @xmath83 number of independent templates which correspond to the three dimensional parameter space , the false alarm probability in detector 1 is given by : @xmath142 because the detectors are taken to be identical , the template banks in both are the same ; the template bank depends only on the noise psds which are taken to be identical .",
    "therefore we do not attach any subscript to @xmath83 .",
    "we set the same threshold @xmath143 in each detector .",
    "we then draw up lists of candidate events which cross the threshold @xmath143 in each detector .",
    "we thus obtain two lists corresponding to each detector .",
    "we check for consistency between candidate events if a candidate event in detector 1 has at least one candidate event in detector 2 lying within the parameter window @xmath137 centered around the parameters of the candidate event in detector 1 .",
    "the size of @xmath137 is determined by @xmath143 , as seen from the fisher information matrix or otherwise through simulations .",

    "in order to plot the roc curves , we need to estimate @xmath84 , or equivalently @xmath146 .",
    "however we find that it is not easy to determine @xmath146 as we did to determine @xmath83 .",
    "we thus need the help of the full numerical simulation to determine @xmath146 , which is discussed in the next subsection .      as mentioned before",
    ", the roc curves fairly compare the coherent and coincidence strategies of detecting signals . at the same false alarm we can compare the detection efficiency ( probability ) by plotting these curves .",
    "we consider several situations here .",
    "the simplest of these involve injecting signals in a small rectangle in the @xmath225 space in the neighbourhood around the point corresponding to individual masses of @xmath235 .",
    "we plot the roc curves for the uncorrelated case @xmath136 and the correlated cases @xmath281 .",
    "we then extrapolate our results to the full parameter space by making certain assumptions which we state later and plot the roc curves .",

    "the signal is injected in a rectangle @xmath282 of the @xmath225 plane with its center at @xmath283 sec , @xmath284 sec which lies well inside the parameter space , and away from its boundaries .",
    "the signal parameters are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution over the section of the parameter space consisting of the rectangle @xmath282 in the @xmath225 space , @xmath16 and initial phase .",
    "the snr is fixed at 10 . in order to detect a signal in @xmath282",
    ", the detection templates also span a rectangle @xmath285 , larger than @xmath282 to take into account effects of noise - a signal lying in @xmath282 could be detected by a template outside it , especially if the signal lies close to its boundary .",
    "@xmath285 is chosen sufficiently large so that the width of the margin @xmath286 is @xmath287 and @xmath288 in the relevant dimensions .",
    "specifically , we take @xmath289 sec and @xmath290 sec .",
    "the resulting figures are plotted for @xmath136 , 0.2 and 0.3 ( figures [ roc ] , [ roccorr](a ) and [ roccorr](b ) , respectively ) .",
    "the trend of declining performance for increasing values of @xmath117 is evident . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the roc curve of a single detector . however , the performance of coherent detection is better than that of the coincident detection for all thresholds .",
    "we get a factor of roughly 2 to 4 times improvement in the detection efficiency over the coincident detector for a given rate of false alarm .",
    "it justifies , why despite the heavier computational burden @xcite , the coherent detection strategy is preferable .",
    "it allows one to push the false alarm rate down for a given detection efficiency , increasing the confidence of detection . in figs.[roc ] and [ roccorr ] , theoretical roc curves derived in section iii are also plotted .",
    "we use the value of @xmath83 determined in section iv.b . on the other hand , we set @xmath291 ( i.e. , @xmath292 ) for the value of window parameters .",
    "we find that with this choice of the value @xmath83 and @xmath146 , we can obtain a fairly good fit of theoretical curves to the simulation curves .",
    "as discussed in section iv.c , the size of parameter windows and the decorrelation length suggests that the number of independent templates in the parameter window is nearly 1 ( i.e. , @xmath293 ) .",
    "although a small change in @xmath146 does not change the roc curve very much , if we set @xmath293 , the theoretical roc curve deviates from the simulation curve significantly .",
    "this suggests that although the templates within a parameter window in table i are spaced within the decorrelation length , the correlations between samples are not very large .",
    "we thus need to take @xmath146 which is slightly smaller than unity , @xmath294 .    0.5 cm   determined in section iv.b .",

    "we consider a one year data train and search the whole parameter space spanned by masses 1@xmath295 - 40@xmath295 .",
    "we assume that the sampling rate of the detector is 2048hz .",
    "then the number of time templates would be @xmath296    0.5 cm , for an injected signal of snr=10.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to evaluate the number of mass templates , we assume the metric is constant in the parameter space , for simplicity .",
    "we follow the analysis by owen @xcite . for the ligo i noise spectrum ,",
    "3pn phasing formula and @xmath297 , we obtain @xmath298 .",
    "thus , the total number of templates is @xmath299    in section iv.b , we have determined the value of this fraction of independent templates to the number of total templates to be 0.19 . as only the parameter space has enlarged and the metric is nearly flat ( which implies the correlations between templates depend essentially on the difference between parameters and not on the locations of the templates ) , the fraction of independent templates to the total number of templates should not be very different from this value - we assume this fraction to be the same , namely , 0.19 .",
    "we also assume @xmath291 for the coincident detection .",
    "assuming @xmath83 and @xmath146 in this manner , and snr = 10 , we plot the roc curves in fig .",
    "we find that , in fact , the net effect is to only translate the roc curves along the @xmath90 axis relative to the ones plotted in the previous cases .",
    "finally , we consider the case of inspiral sources distributed uniformly in space and uniformly in orientation - the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the binary is distributed uniformly over the sphere .",
    "we assume a uniform distribution within 0.4 mpc and 26 mpc",
    ". the lower limit on the distance ensures that our galaxy is excluded and the upper limit on the distance comes from the maximum range of ligo i detectors for snr of 7 .",
    "the direction of the orbital angular momentum is determined randomly .",
    "we consider the one year data train , sampled at 2048hz and the mass parameter region , @xmath300 .",
    "the roc curves are given by fig.[rocdistributedsource ] .",
    "we find that the coherent detection is better than the coincident detection by about 25 - 40%",
    ".    0.5 cm",
    "we have compared two possible strategies of multi - detector detection , namely , the coincidence and the coherent .",
    "we have considered the inspiral waveform for this purpose and by plotting the roc curves for the two strategies we obtain a fair assessment of their performance .",
    "we have considered several cases from the simple to implement , to the more astrophysically relevant one .",
    "the bottom line here is that the coherent strategy of detection is superior to the coincidence strategy .",
    "the roc curves display this fact quantitatively for all the cases considered .",
    "the coherent detection strategy uses the likelihood function which inherently uses the information of phase coherence to decide on detection .",
    "this information is encoded in the pdf of the @xmath188 hypothesis , that a signal is present in the data .",
    "the pdf explicitly contains the signal from each detector in the network with consistent phase .",
    "thus the coherent strategy inherently accommodates the phase information .",
    "moreover , the likelihood analysis leads naturally to the matched filter which is the optimal filter for the network output .",
    "on the other hand , the coincidence strategy uses separate event lists formed by identifying candidate events in each detector considered in isolation - it ignores the crucial phase information that is inherent in a signal generated from a specific astrophysical source .",
    "this critical difference between the two analyses leads to the coherent analysis having superior detection performance .",
    "moreover , when we consider correlated noise between detectors , the coherent strategy again leads to matched filters which are optimal .",
    "the correlations between the noise enter naturally into the likelihood analysis and the matched filter depends on these correlations . in coincidence analysis , on the other hand , the correlations between detectors simply do not play any role in the detection procedure and are thus _ ipso facto _ ignored .    in this paper",
    "we have treated two detectors with identical noise psd , identically oriented and in the same location .",
    "the results are easily generalized from two to @xmath108 detectors with identical noise psd , with identical orientation and in the same location .",
    "we next propose to generalize these results to include arbitrarily oriented detectors in different geographical locations .",
    "we expect that the difference in performance between the two strategies to be more striking .",
    "one reason is that for differently oriented detectors , there is a finite possibility that a signal may not be detected separately by both detectors , thus ruling out coincidence detection , while coherently it could still be detected .",
    "the work in this paper can be generalized in a straight forward manner to other gw sources with known waveforms of finite duration .",
    "more importantly , we believe that this work could be generalized to burst sources where the waveform could be constrained from physical and astrophysical considerations .",
    "some work already exists in this direction @xcite .",
