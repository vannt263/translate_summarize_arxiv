    "the photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections of molecules are of significant interest in many fields of both fundamental and applied sciences .",
    "the oscillator strength distribution characterizing the optical response is the most important quantity in understanding the interaction of photon with electrons in atoms , molecules , and matters .",
    "the oscillator strength distribution in the whole spectral region has been extensively studied with the advanced synchrotron radiation and the high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy @xcite . in order to see how the oscillator strength changes with varying molecular structures , it is useful to study isomer molecules .",
    "since the isomers consist of the same kind and the same number of atoms , we expect similarity of the oscillator strengths at high photon energies . this is because the molecular structure has little influence on the excitation of inner core electrons .",
    "however , the valence photoabsorption may differ according to the difference of electronic states between the isomers .",
    "in fact , koizumi et al . have observed a prominent distinction for the cross sections of simple hydrocarbon isomers , c@xmath0h@xmath1 ( cyclopropane and propylene ) , at photon energies of @xmath2 ev @xcite .",
    "the photoabsorption and photoionization data of cyclopropane in this energy region were later improved by a measurement with metallic thin film windows @xcite .",
    "these works clearly show that the oscillator strengths have different peaks and shoulders depending on the isomers in a continuous spectral region above the ionization potentials ( ips ) .",
    "theoretical investigation for the isomer effect of c@xmath0h@xmath1 has been demanded for a long time , however , none has been reported so far .",
    "this is due to difficulties in treatment of the electronic continuum in a non - spherical multicenter potential .",
    "there are several methods which are able to take into account correlations among valence electrons in the continuum @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some of them are not suitable for calculating detailed structures of the spectra , and some are difficult to be applied to large molecules . we have recently developed an alternative theoretical method for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the time - dependent local - density approximation ( tdlda ) in a grid representation of the three - dimensional cartesian coordinate , and utilizes the green s function to take account of the continuum boundary condition .",
    "we use iterative methods to solve linear algebraic equations for construction of the dynamical screening field above the first ip . the theoretical background of our method is similar to the one of ref .  @xcite in which the authors used a single - center expansion technique .",
    "however , the application was limited to small axially symmetric molecules , because of difficulties in the single - center expansion .",
    "our method is based on direct calculation of the self - consistent screening potential in the three - dimensional grid representation , which does not rely on the expansion and requires no spatial symmetry .    in the present letter , we report the valence photoabsorption of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 isomers studied with the continuum tdlda method in ref .",
    "@xcite , and would like to show the power of the method . then , we give an interpretation of the continuous spectra and elucidate origins of the isomer effects .",
    "optical response of molecules is characterized by the oscillator strength , denoted as @xmath3 in the followings , which is given by @xmath4 where the transition density @xmath5 is related to the fourier component of a time - dependent external dipole perturbation in @xmath6-direction , @xmath7 , through a complex susceptibility ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the tdlda describes a spin - independent @xmath9-electron system in terms of the time - dependent kohn - sham equations .",
    "correlations among electrons are taken into account through deformations of the self - consistent kohn - sham potential . linearizing the kohn - sham potential with respect to the transition density ,",

    "construction of the green s function is easily done for a rotationally invariant potential @xmath15 , using the partial wave expansion @xcite .",
    "thus , we split the kohn - sham potential into two parts , a long - range spherical part , @xmath15 , and a short - range deformed part , @xmath16 .",
    "first , we construct the green s function , @xmath17 , for the spherical potential @xmath18 , then , @xmath14 can be obtained from an identity @xmath19    we solve eqs .",
    "( [ delta_n ] ) , ( [ chi_0 ] ) , and ( [ g ] ) simultaneously in the uniform grid representation of the three - dimensional real space .",
    "equations ( [ delta_n ] ) and ( [ g ] ) are linear algebraic equations with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath14 , respectively , for which an iterative method provides an efficient algorithm for the numerical procedure .",
    "we adopt the generalized conjugate residual method for these non - hermitian problems .",
    "we would like to refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussion of the methodology and the theoretical background .",

    "@xcite , @xmath21 $ ] , and the gradient correction of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath22 $ ] , which will be abbreviated to lb potential .",
    "this gradient correction is constructed so as to reproduce the correct coulomb asymptotic behavior of the potential ( @xmath23 ) and to describe the rydberg states .",
    "it was also pointed out that the lb potential is necessary to reproduce the excitation energies of high - lying bound states in the tdlda @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we have also found for simple molecules that the tdlda with the lb potential reasonably accounts for resonances embedded in the continuum .    [",
    "cols=\"^,>,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     [ trk ]      we would like to discuss details of resonance peaks and an origin of the different behaviors between the isomers .",
    "first , let us compare the ipa results for the two isomers ( see dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ dfdw_cyclo1 ] ( a ) and [ dfdw_propy ] ( a ) ) . in the energy region of @xmath2",
    "ev , although the bulk structure is similar , cyclopropane shows a sharper main peak at 11.5 ev and an additional peak at 13 ev",
    ". this may be due to higher - fold degeneracies in electronic eigenstates in cyclopropane .",
    "these peak structures in cyclopropane remain after inclusion of the dynamical screening effects , while , for propylene , the strong peak at 12 ev seen in the ipa is diminished .",
    "next , we shall examine this difference in the dynamical screening effects .    for this purpose , it is useful to calculate a partial oscillator strength @xcite which corresponds to a contribution of each occupied orbital to the total oscillator strength .",
    "we display the partial @xmath3 in the energy range of @xmath24 ev in figs .",
    "[ dfdw_cyclo1 ] ( b ) and [ dfdw_propy ] ( b ) .",
    "one can see that the major contributions to @xmath3 come from bound - to - continuum excitations of electrons near the fermi level ; the homo @xmath25 and the second homo @xmath26 in case of cyclopropane , and the second @xmath27 , the third @xmath28 and the fourth homo @xmath29 for propylene .    the sharp peaks at 11.8 ev and 13.5 ev in cyclopropane originate from bound - to - bound transitions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 electrons .",
    "these resonances are also seen in the ipa calculation .",
    "then , the electron - electron correlation brings out coherent contributions of bound - to - continuum excitations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 electrons .",
    "the width of the resonances becomes slightly larger than that of the ipa , because of the autoionization process .",
    "the peak at 15.7 ev is also produced by coherent excitations of @xmath32 ( bound - to - bound ) and @xmath25 ( bound - to - continuum ) electrons .",
    "we only see a shoulder around 15.5 ev in the ipa calculation , however , the dynamical effect enhances the peak .    in the case of propylene",
    ", we find several small peaks of bound - to - bound excitations in the partial @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ dfdw_propy ] ( b ) .",
    "however , the bound - to - continuum excitations , which mostly contribute to the broad resonance in @xmath33 ev , behave rather independently , and do not produce coherent enhancement of those peaks . as a result ,",
    "the small peaks in the bound - to - bound transitions are mostly smeared out in the total oscillator strength .",
    "we think that this difference in the continuum response could be attributed to the difference in strength of bound - to - bound transitions .",
    "the @xmath3 of propylene shows a typical behavior of the dynamical screening effects .",
    "namely , the oscillator strengths ( and the peak at 12 ev ) in the ipa calculation are significantly weakened by the induced screening field in eq .",
    "( [ delta_n ] ) .",
    "conversely , those at energies above 16 ev are enhanced .",
    "this is because the real part of the dynamical polarizability changes its sign at @xmath34 ev , then the screening field changes into the `` anti - screening field '' at higher energies . in the case of cyclopropane ,",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated . generally speaking , the real part of the dynamical polarizability changes its sign from positive to negative at bound resonances . since the degeneracies of electronic orbitals are higher in cyclopropane , the bound - to - bound transitions have large oscillator strengths .",
    "then , there appears a reminiscence of bound resonance in the continuum region .",
    "the screening field suddenly drops down at energies corresponding to bound - to - bound transitions .",
    "this provides effective anti - screening effects to cause the peak structures in the bound - to - continuum transitions .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on dependence of our results upon the parameter @xmath35 in the lb potential @xmath36 .",
    "a choice of this parameter is rather arbitrary , since the value of @xmath35 does not change the coulomb asymptotic behavior .",
    "in fact , if we adopt @xmath37 , the value proposed by the original paper @xcite , we obtain better agreement to the photoabsorption spectra for both the isomers . in the case of using @xmath37 , the kohn - sham eigenvalues for occupied orbitals in cyclopropane",
    "are indicated as values in brackets in table  [ spe ] .",
    "a binding energy of each orbital becomes deeper by @xmath38 ev , though spacings between the orbitals almost stay constant .",
    "the calculated oscillator strength distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ dfdw_cyclo2 ] for cyclopropane .",
    "the disagreement on the peak positions are removed in the calculation .",
    "a bound peak at 10 ev is also well reproduced in the calculation .",
    "this peak consists of the excitations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 electrons .",
    "these excitations have an almost identical energy when we use @xmath37 , while the excitation of @xmath26 electrons is shifted to lower energy by 1 ev when using @xmath39 . except for the bound peak at 10 ev ,",
    "the characteristic features of the oscillator strength distribution are not changed , and we maintain the interpretation given above .",
    "but for using a parameter @xmath37 in the calculation .",
    "the calculation has been performed for an energy range of @xmath40 ev with a mesh of @xmath41 ev .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the oscillator strength distributions of c@xmath0h@xmath1 isomer molecules are studied with the tdlda in the continuum utilizing the three - dimensional cartesian coordinate representation .",
    "the calculation shows good agreement with experiments .",
    "the oscillator strength in the energy region above 22 ev is almost identical among the isomers , however , different peaks appear below that .",
    "this isomer effect is analysed by calculating the partial oscillator strength of each occupied orbital .",
    "in addition to the difference in properties of bound electronic orbitals , it turns out that bound - to - continuum excitations of electrons near the fermi level behave differently between the isomers .",
    "the bound - to - bound transitions in cyclopropane possess large strengths , and the bound - to - continuum transitions exhibit coherent peak structures because of the anti - screening effects . on the other hand , in propylene ,",
    "the bound - to - bound transitions are too weak to produce the anti - screening peaks for the continuum excitations .",
    "although the molecular structure directly has minor influence on the continuum , the difference in bound - to - bound transitions leads to variation in the dynamical screening effects to change the continuum excitations .",
