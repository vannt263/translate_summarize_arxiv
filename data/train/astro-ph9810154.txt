    "bl lac objects are a rare type of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "because their spectrum does not show prominent emission and absorption lines they are difficult to find and getting redshift information from absorption lines due to their host galaxies requires a huge amount of telescope time .",
    "therefore not many complete samples exist with known redshifts .",
    "the most often cited `` @xmath0 sample '' contains 35 bl lac objects selected in the radio wavelength region ( stickel et al .",
    "1991 ) . at x - ray wavelengths a complete",
    "well defined sample was built up with the emss ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) ; morris et al .",
    "( 1991 ) presented a sample of 22 objects down to @xmath1 which was later expanded to 30 objects and lower fluxes by wolter et al .",
    "while radio selected bl lac show positive evolution , like `` normal '' agn , x - ray selected bl lac show negative evolution ( morris et al .",
    "1991 , wolter et al .",
    "1994 ) , so they have been less numerous and/or luminous at high redshifts than in the local universe .",
    "we contribute to the discussion about the evolutionary behaviour of bl lac objects with a new sample of up to now 72 x - ray selected bl lac objects , with redshifts available for more than 80 % of them .",
    "the selection is based on the rosat all - sky survey ( rass , voges et al .",
    "+ in this paper cosmological parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are used .",
    "the bl lac sample presented here is part of the hamburg - rass x - ray bright agn sample ( hrx , cordis et al .",
    "the hrx was pre - identified on direct and objective prism plates which were taken with the hamburg schmidt telescope on calar alto , spain , within the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs , hagen et al .",
    "several follow - up campaigns were done to classify those objects which had been unidentified on the schmidt plates and to determine redshifts for the agn candidates . a first bl lac sample , hereafter core sample , drawn from an area of @xmath4 contained 35 objects and was complete down to a rosat pspc ( @xmath5 kev ) countrate of @xmath6 .",
    "this sample was presented and discussed by bade et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . to examine the dependence of the evolutionary behaviour on x - ray dominance , we split the core sample into two groups according to @xmath7 as the power law index between @xmath8 kev and @xmath9  with @xmath10 .",
    "objects with @xmath11 we will call x - ray dominated bl lac , the other ones are the _ intermediate objects _",
    "( ibl ) , because they have physical properties between the x - ray and radio dominated bl lac objects .",
    "we found the x - ray dominated objects to have negative evolution , while objects with steeper @xmath7 showed no evolution at all .",
    "a new sample , hereafter enlarged sample , has been defined now to improve the statistics .",
    "it contains the core sample and 37 further bl lac drawn from an area of @xmath12 with countrate limit of @xmath13 .",
    "spectroscopic observations to determine their redshifts are underway .",
    "prensently for the core region redshifts are known for 32 out of 35 bl lac ( 91 % ) and for the enlarged region for 59 out of 72 bl lac ( 82 % ) .",
    "our criteria to classify x - ray sources as bl lac objects are similar to the work of the emss .",
    "so we use `` conservative '' criteria : emission lines with must be absent and the contrast of the ca ii break from the hosting galaxy must be less than @xmath14 in the optical spectrum . we want to emphasize that the core sample was selected without help of information on radio fluxes .",
    "it was found however that at the flux limit of the hrx sample all bl lac objects were detected by the vla surveys nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and first ( white et al .  1997 ) .",
    "we therefore used these radio surveys to find the bl lac objects in the enlarged area .",
    "after completion of the hrx also the enlarged sample will be determined without the help of the radio information .",
    "the x - ray selection is based on the rosat pspc hard countrate in the rass .",
    "the conversion factor between flux and countrate for a single power law depends on the photon index is related to the photon index @xmath15 @xmath16 and the hydrogen column density @xmath17 .",
    "we assume only absorption due to galactic @xmath17 taken from stark et al .",
    "the photon index was calculated with the hardness ratios given in the rass ; this method is described in detail in schartel et al .",
    "+ spectroscopic follow - up observations of bl lac are made with the mosca spectrograph at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope .",
    "a first result is the determination of the redshift of the bl lac 1517 + 656 ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath18 distribution ( fig .  [ fig-2 ] ) is independent of the subtle redshift determination process for bl lac objects .",
    "the sample shows a steep slope consistent with the euclidean value of @xmath19 down to @xmath20(0.52.0 kev ) @xmath21 . below this flux",
    "the distribution has a flatter slope of @xmath22 .",
    "the bump around the turnover point is mainly caused by x - ray dominated objects .",
    "this can be clearly seen by deriving number counts for the two subgroups , related to the x - ray dominance as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the ibl show a more or less flat slope of @xmath22 in the range @xmath23 , while the x - ray dominated objects show a steep slope of -2.1 for @xmath24 , and a flat slope ( @xmath25 ) for lower fluxes .",
    "the different distributions indicate that the evolution of the two bl lac groups is different . +    while we have reliable redshifts for all but one of the x - ray dominated objects , we still miss redshifts for 12 ibl ; in the view of the unified scheme due to different opening angles of x - ray and radio selected bl lac , the reason might be , that in the ibl the core outshines the hosting galaxy and absorption lines are more difficult to detect than in the x - ray dominated bl lac which are observed more off - axis from the jet .",
    "+ to examine the evolutionary behaviour we use a @xmath26 test ( schmidt 1968 ) which is the mean of the ratios between the volume , in which an object is found , and the maximal volume , where the object could have been found .",
    "this depends mainly on the ratio between the observed flux and the flux limit .",
    "the results are listed below : +    [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      + the @xmath26 test confirms the negative evolution for the enlarged sample reported by bade et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for",
    "the ibl redshifts are missing for 30% of the objects so that their non - evolution could not be tested with the enlarged sample yet .",
    "the x - ray dominated bl lac have in the mean higher redshifts , which implies higher luminosities as well .",
    "figure  [ fig-4 ] shows the dependence of the x - ray luminosity on @xmath7 .",
    "there is clear evidence for a relation between those values on a @xmath27 confidence level , while the absolute optical magnitude and the luminosity in the radio band seem not to be correlated with @xmath7 ( bade et al .",
    "+ the spectral properties in the rosat pspc band are quite typical for selected bl lac ; we find a photon index @xmath28 for the x - ray dominated objects and @xmath29 for ibl ( fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ) , which is in good agreement with siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who found a value of @xmath30 for the latter .",
    "these spectral slopes are slightly flatter than the values found for all types of x - ray selected agn ( e.g. @xmath31 , walter & fink 1993 ; @xmath32 , ciliegi & maccacaro 1996 ; @xmath33 , beckmann & bade 1999 ) . + while determining redshifts for objects of our sample , we also took an optical spectrum of 1517 + 656 .",
    "this source was identified as a bl lac in the course of the einstein slew survey ( elvis et al .",
    "we determined the redshift as @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) and the apparent magnitude as @xmath35 by comparison with standard stars near to the bl lac ( villata et al .",
    "1998 ) . with an absolute magnitude of @xmath36",
    "this is the optically most luminous x - ray selected bl lac which is known so far .",
    "for the x - ray dominated bl lac we find negative evolution , while ibl show no evolution at all , even though the latter result has still to be confirmed for the enlarged sample .",
    "radio selected bl lac show positive evolution ; therefore it is hard to imagine how a unified scheme for bl lac could look like , which tries to identify x - ray and radio selected bl lac objects with a common parent population in which only some physical parameters of the jet are varied ( e.g. beaming properties , angle @xmath37 between line of sight and jet ) . the different evolutionary behaviour is a strong hint to physically different types of objects .",
    "the distinct properties in the two x - ray selected subgroups are already revealed in the bright part of the @xmath38 distribution .",
    "it is therefore implausible that selection effects , as described by browne & marcha ( 1993 ) , are responsible for these differences .",
    "it might be , that the evolving time for x - ray bright jets is longer than for the radio fraction ; this would explain , why x - ray selected bl lac are more numerous in the local universe than at high redshift . on the other hand the relation between @xmath7 and the x - ray luminosity leads to the idea of an outburst scenario . in that case , the intermediate objects would be the parent population and bl lac in an x - ray outburst would have high x - ray luminosities and would be x - ray dominated .",
    "strong evidence for this model is supplied by the fact that there are no x - ray dominated bl lac with low x - ray luminosities ; because we only miss the redshift of one of those objects , there is little doubt about this result . in this model ,",
    "an ibl having an outburst would become more luminous in the x - rays , while staying nearly constant in the optical and in the radio band ; therefore the @xmath7 value would decrease and the spectral slope in the x - ray band would flatten .",
    "this model is also supported by the spectral slope distribution , showing the outbursting bl lac having flatter x - ray spectra than the intermediate ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] ) , while the absolute optical magnitude seems not to be correlated with @xmath7 . +",
    "both scenarios as well as the unified scheme still do not give satisfying explanation for all observed properties in bl lac objects .",
