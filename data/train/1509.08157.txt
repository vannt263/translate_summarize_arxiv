    "social interaction is critical for swarms to perform an effective and coordinated response to changing environments .",
    "social activity and the associated transmission of information through the interaction network have recently attracted considerable attention in a wide range of complex systems : from the biological realm ",
    "flock of birds  @xcite , school of fish  , swarm of midges  , and human crowds  @xcite  and social networks  @xcite , to artificial multiagent systems such as the power grid   and robotic swarms  @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the interaction network are known to strongly affect the swarm dynamics   and , in particular , its capacity to respond to local perturbations  .    increasing the amount of social interaction",
    "usually improves the performance of collectives , but it is known that most natural swarms operate with a limited number of social connections ",
    "i.e . with a very specific interaction network . for instance , flocking starlings interact on average with a fixed number of conspecifics6 to 7  @xcite  and swarms of midges  @xcite regulate their nearest - neighbor distance depending on the size of the swarm .",
    "gordon et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that one species of ants ( _ l .",
    "fuliginosus _ ) regulate its rate of social encounters following : _",
    "( i ) _ changes in the nestmate density for undisturbed ant colonies , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the introduction of an external perturbation ",
    "workers from another colony  in the colony .",
    "this limited interaction appears to be a behavioral feature and not a direct result of physical limitations of their sensing capabilities .",
    "these findings suggest that excessive social activity could be detrimental to the collective dynamics and leads us to conjecture that it can hinder its responsiveness to environmental changes .",
    "understanding the consequences of excessive social activity is critical for achieving new functional predictions on collective animal behavior  @xcite , and it has also tremendous implications for the design of artificial swarms  @xcite and for the study of spreading of behaviors in online communities  @xcite .",
    "previous works on the subject   have shown that , above a certain point , increasing the number of social connections yields only marginal benefit to the group . however , identifying and quantifying detrimental effects of excessive social interaction remains elusive .",
    "experimental evidence of such detrimental effects has been found in the collective dynamics of midges  @xcite , where the susceptibility of the system diminishes if the amount of interaction  inferred from density  is increased above a certain value . from the theoretical standpoint ,",
    "some simple models of decision - making dynamics  @xcite predict that over - reliance on social information can render a collective unresponsive to changing circumstances .",
    "models of consensus in mobile communicating agents  @xcite have also shown that consensus can be reached more efficiently with a limited interaction range , which is strictly equivalent to having a limited number of connections .    here",
    ", we examine the triadic relationship between number of social connections , capacity to dynamically respond to environmental perturbations , and correlations within a swarm . to this aim",
    ", we use a classical model of collective motion , in which agents move by adjusting their direction of travel to that of their neighbors .",
    "first , we present an analysis of the correlations in a swarm at statistically steady state , focusing on the effect of interactions on correlation length , strength , and susceptibility .",
    "second , we characterize the responsiveness of the swarm by simulating a predator attack and measuring the survival rate of agents depending on their level of social interaction . finally , we extend the study by considering the effects of the interaction network on the dynamics of a general collective decision - making model .",
    "we use the self - propelled particles ( spp ) model developed by vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite as a minimalist collective motion model that captures the cooperative alignment of orientation .",
    "there are several extensions and improvements to this model that generate more realistic and specific dynamics  @xcite , but we used the original model for the sake of generality and simplicity .",
    "each particle moves in a two - dimensional periodic space and changes its direction of motion at discrete timesteps in order to align to its neighbors mean orientation according to @xmath0 where the velocity vector @xmath1 has constant magnitude @xmath2 and direction @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a random number uniformly distributed in the @xmath5 $ ] range .",
    "the sum @xmath6 is performed over the neighbors of @xmath7 ( including @xmath7 itself ) . while the original vicsek s model considers that a pair of agents interact  i.e .",
    ", are neighbors  if they are closer than a certain distance ( metric interaction ) , there is strong evidence that certain natural systems such as flocks of birds interact with a fixed number of neighbors instead ( topological or metric - free interaction )  @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we have studied different kinds of interactions only to find the same phenomenology ; the responsiveness depends essentially on the amount of interaction in the swarm , not the details of the interaction rule itself .",
    "thus , in the sequel , we will talk about _ sociality _ to refer to the parameter quantifying the amount of interaction between agents , be it the interaction radius in the metric case or the outdegree ( number of neighbors ) in the topological one .",
    "the results presented in this work have been obtained by computing the dynamics of a set of @xmath8 spps following vicsek s model starting from random positions and velocity orientations .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed using the ` libspp ` library  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the documentation of the library for further implementation details .",
    "the dimensionless velocity fluctuation is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average velocity . the correlation function on velocity fluctuations",
    "is then given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the distance between agents @xmath7 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the dirac delta distribution .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath15directly related to the integral of @xmath16 up to its first zero for finite - size systems  is a measure of the total correlation in the system and depends on both the correlation length and strength  @xcite .    to obtain numerical values of the correlation function @xmath17 and susceptibility @xmath15",
    ", we compute the histogram of the correlations in the system every @xmath18 iterations during @xmath19 iterations , after discarding the first @xmath20 iterations as transient dynamics .",
    "the correlation @xmath16 shown in fig .",
    "[ correlation_topo ] is the average over @xmath21 histograms obtained with this procedure .",
    "the predator is introduced as an agent that does not participate in the consensus protocol .",
    "instead , it is afforded predatory capabilities : it moves @xmath22 faster than swarming agents , systematically in the direction pointing to the closest one . when the predator `` catches '' an agent , the latter is removed from the simulation .",
    "an agent can only detect the presence of the threat when it is located at a distance smaller than a fixed `` danger - detection '' radius @xmath23 ; as soon as the agent detects it , an evasive maneuver is initiated with the agent moving away in the direction opposite to the predator .",
    "we have set @xmath23 to be constant throughout the simulations and independent of the sociality between agents .",
    "the fleeing behavior takes precedence over the collective motion of a particular agent for as long as the predator lies inside its danger - detection area .",
    "thus , the agents in this simulation follow the equations of motion   with the exception that @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the predator s position .    the mean avoidance time shown in fig .",
    "[ survival_rate ] is obtained by computing the swarm dynamics in the presence of a single predator for @xmath26 different runs of @xmath27 iterations each .",
    "the reason for computing several runs instead of running the calculation for longer times is that the results depend on the density of agents in the swarm , and the repeated removal of agents by the predator can cause significant changes in the density after long times .",
    "the linear threshold model is a generalization of the simple majority vote model  @xcite where the state of each agent or node @xmath7 is determined by a binary variable @xmath28 .",
    "the dynamics of the model dictates that , at a given timestep @xmath29 , @xmath30 takes the value @xmath31 or @xmath32 according to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average over all neighbors of @xmath7 and @xmath35 is a parameter that determines the minimum ratio of neighbors that need to be in the state @xmath36 for an agent to switch to it .    to study the effects of a perturbation on the collective decision - making process , we consider the following scenario : a given set of @xmath37 networked agents reside in the `` ground '' state @xmath38 when , at @xmath39 , an unspecified perturbation induces a small fraction of `` informed '' agents to abruptly switch to ( and remain in ) the state @xmath40 .",
    "this change propagates through the network and causes more agents to switch from state @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "if the fraction of initially informed agents is large enough and the network is connected , the mean polarization @xmath41 will eventually reach @xmath42 . to characterize the responsiveness of the decision - making process , a good metric is given by @xmath43 which is the speed at which polarization increases .",
    "let us consider a group of @xmath44 identical agents performing a distributed consensus protocol on their scalar state - variable @xmath45 , through a connected and undirected network .",
    "the system is characterized by the global state vector @xmath46 and the adjacency matrix of the underlying graph @xmath47 , where @xmath48 if agent @xmath7 is connected to @xmath13 and 0 otherwise . given a certain graph characteristic of the connectivity among agents , the state of the system evolves according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the natural response frequency of our identical agents , and @xmath51 is the degree of agent @xmath7 , i.e. its number of neighbors in the network sense .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 is introduced for the sake of a compact notation for the governing dynamical equations . as is classical with many swarming systems , eq .",
    "involves relative output information of neighboring agents  @xcite .",
    "we model the process of distributed transfer of social information by considering a leader - follower consensus dynamics .",
    "this is implemented by affording one agent ",
    "say agent @xmath53with a dynamics not abiding by eq .",
    ", but instead following an arbitrary trajectory @xmath54 .",
    "this single control input has a direct effect onto the dynamics of its @xmath55 neighboring agents , but also has indirect effects onto the dynamics of many more agents through the coupled set of dynamical equations  . in the presence of this single leader , eq .",
    "can be recast as @xmath56 for @xmath57 .    within this leader - follower scheme",
    ", one can characterize the responsiveness of the multi - agent system undergoing the distributed consensus process as its capacity to follow fast changes in the leader s dynamics , @xmath58 . specifically , with an input signal oscillating at the frequency @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the state of all agents at long times becomes proportional to @xmath58 given the linear time - invariant ( lti ) dynamics , eq .  .",
    "this allows us to define the system s responsiveness as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the identity matrix of dimension @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the @xmath65 consensus protocol matrix and @xmath66 is the @xmath63-vector resulting from projecting @xmath67 onto the subspace of the leader . from the control theory standpoint , @xmath68 is the vector of amplitude gains , @xmath69 , at the frequency @xmath59  @xcite . as is clear from eq .",

    ", our focus lies with the overall responsiveness of the system , which has recently been shown to be heavily influenced by the nodal dynamics and the network topology  @xcite .",
    "our measure of the collective ability to respond to fast changes induced by the leader is given by the normalized total gain @xmath78 which allow us to study analytically the effects of increasing connectivity between agents on the system s responsiveness to external signals of varying frequencies .",
    "a natural starting point to characterize the responsiveness of a system is to study the correlation in fluctuations of the consensus variable . following the framework developed by attanasi et al .",
    ", we have computed the correlation in velocity fluctuations for a swarm composed of @xmath8 spps for different socialities .",
    "we set a low noise level ( @xmath79 ) and let the system relax to a highly - ordered and statistically stationary state before sampling the correlation over a large number of configuration snapshots  ( see methods ) .",
    "the susceptibility is limited by the intrinsic trade - off between the spatial spreading of correlation and its short - range intensity : an increase in the sociality allows the information to travel farther through the network  increased correlation length  but causes each agent to be exposed to more information , thus decreasing the relevance of each individual signal  decreased strength .    the computed correlation function @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "[ correlation_topo ] for three different values of the number of neighbors @xmath80 , illustrating clearly the trade - off between correlation spread and intensity . for small values of @xmath80 , correlations are large although confined to short distances . as the amount of social interaction increases , so does the spread of correlations and thus the susceptibility @xmath15 . above a certain optimal number of neighbors , which is around @xmath81 for the particular configuration used in our calculation",
    ", the increase in spatial spreading can not compensate the reduction in correlation strength and the susceptibility of the system diminishes with increasing sociality .",

    "inset : susceptibility @xmath15 as a function of the number of neighbors or outdegree @xmath80 . ]      in order to study the relation between susceptibility and collective dynamical response , we have simulated a predator attack and measured the survival rate of agents with different levels of social interaction ( see methods ) .    the emergent collective avoidance maneuver is shown in fig .",
    "[ evasive ] for three selected snapshots of a predator attack and in movie m1 ( see supplementary information ) . at @xmath85 ( leftmost frame ) ,",
    "the predator starts the attack on a highly - aligned section of the swarm .",
    "only the agents that detect the predator  those inside the red circle  react according to eq .  .",
    "after 13 iterations , agents outside the detection area are collectively reacting to the threat thanks to the social information transmitted through the swarm .",
    "after 26 iterations from the start of the attack , all the agents in the vicinity of the predator perform a global evasive maneuver .",
    "notice that the information transfer has taken place strikingly fast even though the agents themselves are considerably slower than the predator .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with recent empirical observations of collective turns in flocks of starlings  @xcite and startled schools of fish  @xcite . specifically , attanasi et al .",
    "@xcite have highlighted the spatially - localized origin of the triggering behavioral signal in collective turns of starlings very much like what can be seen in fig .",
    "[ evasive ] and movie m1 .",
    "in addition , for a specific event involving @xmath86 starlings , it took approximately less than 0.6  s for the information to flow through the whole flock , corresponding to an amazingly fast speed of information transfer of the order of 2040 m  s@xmath87 ( 3 times faster than the flock itself ) .",
    "the social alignment consensus alone is sufficient for the vast majority of the agents to avoid the predator without ever detecting it .",
    "this phenomenon of augmented perceptual range in swarms due to social transfer of information is well known in flocks of birds  @xcite and schools of fish  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic avoidance time for the swarm , defined as the average time elapsed between two consecutive catches by the predator , is shown in fig .  [ survival_rate](a ) as a function of the mean number of connections for both metric and topological interactions . in the latter case ,",
    "the number of connections is exactly the imposed outdegree value @xmath80 , while in the former the average is computed over all agents and iterations .",
    "interestingly , both interactions yield essentially the same outcome .",
    "this finding is consistent with the recent conclusion that swarms of spps based on a metric or topological interaction distance belong to the same universality class with respect to their critical behavior  @xcite .",
    "starting from a noninteracting collective ( @xmath88 ) , the avoidance time grows with the amount of social interaction up to a maximum value about @xmath22 larger than the noninteracting time . from that optimal point at approximately 20 neighbors , the avoidance time monotonously decreases with increasing sociality , all the way down back to the value obtained for a noninteracting collective . in order to better understand how sociality influences the mean avoidance time of the swarm , movies m1 to m3 in the supplemental material present the movement of the swarm in a simulation for each of the three characteristic regimes : optimal sociality ( @xmath89 ) , insufficient sociality ( @xmath90 ) , and excessive sociality ( @xmath91 ) respectively .",
    "fig-3-a ( 20,55 ) ( a )    fig-3-b ( 20,55 ) ( b )    taking the avoidance time as a measure of the capacity of a swarm to respond to localized perturbations , we can finally assess its relationship with susceptibility .",
    "figure  [ survival_rate](b ) shows how the avoidance time for a particular sociality varies with the susceptibility @xmath15 of the equivalent swarm .",
    "figure  [ survival_rate](b ) unambiguously shows a systematic improvement in responsiveness with increased correlations , again for both metric and topological interactions .      the distribution of avoidance times ( see fig .",
    "[ survival_histo ] ) reveals that the improved response of the system is not due to a shift in the peak of the distribution ",
    "i.e . , it is not due to a lengthening of the most probable avoidance time  but instead , is a consequence of a heavy tail appearing in the distribution .",
    "specifically , the heavy tail manifests an increase in the probability of having large lapses of time during which the predator is unable to catch any prey .",
    "heavy tails , or power - law distributions of rare events , are common features of complex systems . in some cases , they are a clear signature of self - organized criticality  @xcite . when a system features power - law distributions , it is said to have scale - free cascades or , shall we name them for this collective animal motion model , `` stampede '' events : rare but large events that dominate the dynamics of the system .",
    "indeed , in our calculations the heavy tails alone are responsible for the @xmath22 improvement in the average avoidance time shown in fig .",
    "[ survival_rate ] .",
    "these stampedes are emergent system - wide responses of the swarm to the threat presented by the predator .",
    "while the avoidance time corresponding to the peak of the distribution depends on the properties of individual agents ( namely @xmath2 and @xmath23 ) , the characteristics of the stampede events depend mostly on the collective properties of the swarm , and in particular on the social interaction between agents . in the absence of interaction",
    ", the system displays a distribution of avoidance times with an exponential decay ( gray shaded curve in fig .",
    "[ survival_histo ] ) . however , a very small amount of interaction  say with only two neighbors ( @xmath92)is sufficient to drastically change the distribution , and yield a stampede effect characterized by a power law for large values of time ( see fig .  [ survival_histo ] ) .",
    "quite interestingly , the exponent of this power law depends on the sociality and displays the detrimental effects induced by excessive social interaction .",
    "specifically , we found that the power laws for high - sociality swarms ( @xmath93 in fig .",
    "[ survival_histo ] ) were equivalent to those with minimal sociality ( @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ survival_histo ] ) . on the other hand , with @xmath94",
    ", we are close to the optimal value for the sociality with a notably different exponent for the power law distribution associated with more frequent stampede events .      in essence ,",
    "the consensus protocol performed by spps in the frame of vicsek s model is but one example of collective decision - making , and the collective predator avoidance is a consequence of the efficient social information transfer through the swarm . in order to generalize our findings beyond the particular case of vicsek s model , we now turn our attention to a minimalist model of decision - making dynamics allowing us to study the influence of the amount of social interaction on how information propagates through the system .    using the linear threshold model with different degrees of modularity , nematzadeh et al .",
    "@xcite revealed that the network structure has a strong influence on information diffusion .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained by centola  @xcite using experiments on a specifically designed social network . in both cases , the effectiveness in information diffusion",
    "was characterized by the influence of perturbations onto the asymptotic global state .    here , we use the linear threshold model from nematzadeh et al .",
    "@xcite to study the responsiveness of a decision - making process to perturbations .",
    "we characterize this response capacity using the polarization speed @xmath95 , which is essentially the rate at which agents adapt their state to the introduction of perturbations detected by a small number of informed agents ( see methods ) .",
    "these informed agents can be considered as `` leaders '' that drive the system from @xmath96 to @xmath42 , much like the spps detecting the presence of a predator lead the swarm to perform a collective evasive maneuver .",
    "the polarization speed is shown in fig .",
    "[ voters ] for two extreme kinds of network wiring : a directed random network where each agent is randomly connected with @xmath80 agents ( a static version of the networks considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and an undirected regular one - dimensional lattice ( a ring ) where each agent is connected with its @xmath80 nearest neighbors . with both wirings ,",
    "the polarization speed @xmath97 is maximum for a finite outdegree @xmath98 which , for large systems , is fairly independent of the total number of agents @xmath63 .",
    "we want to stress the dynamical nature of this metric : we are not studying the asymptotic polarization at long times as in ref .",
    "@xcite but , instead , dealing with the short - time response capacity of the system . in our case",
    ", we have chosen the number of leaders to be large enough so that the system always reaches @xmath42 , i.e. a full polarization , in a finite time .",
    "however , how fast the system reaches this state depends on the amount of social interaction and , as we saw for the spps , too many connections hinder the performance of the system .    the results in fig .",
    "[ voters ] also reveal that the structure of the network can enhance or diminish the effects of connectivity on the response capacity .",
    "while the optimal outdegree @xmath99 is the same for completely random and highly structured networks , the polarization speed in the random network shows a larger sensitivity to the amount of connections .      in the previous sections ,",
    "we have stressed the importance of distributed consensus problems in both biological and social systems .",
    "both the spp and linear threshold models provide excellent phenomenological frameworks to study how the level of connectivity among agents affects the responsiveness of cooperative systems .",
    "their phenomenological nature however limits our ability to identify and characterize the underlying mechanisms responsible for the impaired collective responses under excessive social connectivity .",
    "moreover , it also hinders our capacity to predict under what conditions a given system might be negatively affected by excessive connectivity . to overcome these limitations ,",
    "we have derived an analytical expression for the responsiveness of a class of cooperative multi - agent systems governed by lti dynamics that captures the essential ingredients of the models considered earlier .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath44 agents performing a linear consensus protocol , and model the effects of local perturbations by setting one agent as a `` leader '' that does not participate to the local consensus dynamics albeit influencing agents connected to it .",
    "this leader - follower distributed consensus problem is used to analyze the capacity of the system to follow and adapt to fast changes in the behavior of the leading agent ( see methods ) . the linear consensus protocol presented in eq .",
    "is fairly standard  . to simplify the problem as much as possible , static and undirected regular one - dimensional lattice topologies@xmath80 nearest neighbors with a ring topology ",
    "are considered for the network of interaction between agents .",
    "significant attention has been dedicated to the problem of convergence to consensus  @xcite and controllability of the multi - agent dynamics  @xcite in the presence of complex network topologies  possibly switching with directed or undirected information flow  . here , given the simple topology of the static network , both convergence to consensus and controllability are guaranteed .",
    "instead , our focus lies with the overall responsiveness of the collective in following fast changes in the dynamics of the single leader  in control - theoretic terms , the input . despite the static nature of the topology of interaction ,",
    "this leader - follower consensus model is a good idealization of the process of social information transmission occurring in startled schools of fish or flocks of birds , where one individual has access to privileged information about a potential threat or other kind of external perturbation .",
    "this temporary leader triggers a wave of agitation that propagates amazingly fast through the swarm  .",
    "such waves of agitation are initiated by extremely rapid changes in the leading agent s state , which very effectively propagate to all other swarming agents  @xcite .    to characterize the effects of varying levels of connectivity ( or sociality ) on the far - from - consensus responsiveness of the collective , fig .",
    "[ state - space ] shows the response capacity of our system to oscillations of the leading agent as a function of the connectivity density@xmath100 can be seen a the sociality of this system  for three oscillation frequencies @xmath59 .",
    "for such a minimalist linear system , the response capacity measured by the total amplitude gain ( see methods ) exhibits a surprisingly rich structure . at low frequencies @xmath101 ,",
    "an increase in sociality always translates to an improvement in the system s capacity to respond to perturbations . at high frequencies @xmath102",
    ", the opposite is true : adding connections systematically yields a reduction the system s performance .",
    "a very interesting intermediate frequency regime is also observed , where the responsiveness of the system is maximum for a given level of sociality .",
    "this trend is reminiscent of what has been uncovered for the variations of the susceptibility @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ correlation_topo ] ) , mean avoidance time ( fig .  [ survival_rate]a ) , and polarization speed @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ voters ] ) as a function of the sociality @xmath80 in the previous phenomenological models .",
    "a myriad of different organisms manifests swarming and social organization to some degree .",
    "it is well known that such collective behaviors notably improve the effectiveness of fundamental tasks , e.g. predator avoidance , foraging , or mating .",
    "however , our analysis of different models of collective behavior all revealed that an excess of social interaction can have detrimental effects , in that it leads to a reduced capacity of response to localized perturbations or threats .",
    "specifically , we have shown that for a system of self - propelling agents  subjected to a consensus protocol to align their velocities  the susceptibility of the swarm is maximized for a finite amount of social interaction . in other words ,",
    "the responsiveness of the swarm is reduced if the sociality is increased above a certain level .",
    "moreover , simulations of predator attacks with both metric and topological interactions reveal a direct connection between the high susceptibility @xmath15 of the swarm and the survivability of its members in hostile environments ( see fig .  [ survival_rate](b ) ) . beyond the realm of natural swarms",
    ", we have found that both simulations of a minimalist model of collective decision - making  the linear threshold model  and a detailed analysis of general linear consensus dynamics exhibit a reduced capacity to respond to perturbations for systems with excessive sociality ( see figs .",
    "[ voters ] and [ state - space ] ) .    the improvement in predator avoidance with social interaction ( ascending branch in fig .",
    "[ survival_rate](a ) ) reflects the expected benefits of swarming behaviors in terms of anti - predator vigilance  @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of a maximum in the avoidance time implies that an excess of social interaction has a negative effect on the capacity of the swarm to respond to a threat . to understand this detrimental effect ,",
    "consider an agent close to the danger - detection area as shown in fig .",
    "[ evasion ] .",
    "its response depends on the information it receives from two kinds of agents : those fleeing away from the predator  namely the agents having access to privileged information  and those unaware of the presence of the predator . if the sociality is too large ( see fig .",
    "[ evasion](b ) ) the relative importance of the fleeing signal is reduced and diluted within the dominating signal coming from the majority of agents in the undisturbed swarm undergoing classical `` herding '' behaviors .    we speculate that this dilution of information occurring for high levels of sociality may be the reason behind the apparently self - imposed limit on social activity observed in flocking birds  @xcite , social ants  @xcite , and other taxa . this detrimental dilution effect for high levels of sociality can also be explained in terms of correlations .",
    "an increase in the number of neighbors yields an increase in the correlation length at the cost of decreasing the correlation strength . at low levels of social activity ( e.g. below @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ correlation_topo ] ) this is a beneficial trade - off for the swarm : the increase in correlation length effectively allows the information to propagate faster through the interaction network .",
    "thus , more agents are capable of responding to the presence of the threat",
    ". however , at high levels of social activity ( e.g. beyond @xmath94 in fig .  [ correlation_topo ] ) , the increase in correlation length only affects agents far away from any danger and marginally benefits the overall performance of the swarm . on the other hand , this increase in the correlation length is accompanied by a drastic reduction in correlation strength that , in turn , severely reduces the responsiveness of agents in the vicinity of the threat .",
    "interestingly , the avoidance time in the limit of large sociality is approximately the same as in the noninteracting swarm ( @xmath103 in fig",
    ".  [ survival_rate ] ) , showing that the oversaturation in the information each agent receives ( i.e. the very large number of neighbors ) effectively negates any benefit of social activity on the dynamical collective response .",
    "it is important noting that our results for dynamical responsiveness complement previous studies associated with global properties , such as the robustness of the interaction network  @xcite or the consensus speed  @xcite . in these studies , increasing the amount of interaction eventually yields diminishing returns ",
    "i.e . less gain per neighbor , but never an actual reduction in the property of interest .",
    "diminishing returns can only justify the preference for a finite number of connections if the cost for establishing links between agents is significant .",
    "however , quantifying such costs is close to impossible given the complexity associated with sensory and neurological requirements in biological swarms  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present study on the dynamical responsiveness of the swarm shows an absolute reduction in swarming effectiveness when the number of neighbors is increased above a certain level .",
    "this fact raises the important question of why collectives having excessive connectivity display a reduced effectiveness under some scenarios such as a predator attack , but not under others such as consensus reaching for instance .",
    "the present analysis of the responsiveness of multi - agent systems following lti consensus dynamics under time - varying perturbations reveals that one key element for predicting the effect of connectivity on responsiveness is how fast the perturbation is . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ state - space ] , high levels of connectivity provide marginal benefits when the system is subjected to slow perturbations , but yield a sizable reduction in effectiveness in the presence of relatively fast perturbations .",
    "fig-7 ( 1,54 ) ( a ) ( 51,54 ) ( b )    it has been proposed that most biological systems may be poised near criticality  @xcite , that is , they reside near the critical point between an ordered phase and a disordered one where the system becomes highly correlated .",
    "this has been proven to be the case for swarms of midges lacking global collective order  @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was observed that these swarms keep a low value of the alignment order parameter although they exhibit high levels of directional correlations and susceptibility  .",
    "being at the edge of chaos is apparently a favorable strategy for collectives faced with changing circumstances .",
    "however , this may not be a viable option for natural swarms that rely on emergent global order to perform collective actions such as migration , milling , etc .",
    "the presence of stampede events  i.e .",
    "heavy tails in the avoidance time shown in fig .",
    "[ survival_histo]is a clear evidence of a swarming system exhibiting self - organized criticality while maintaining high levels of alignment , which starkly contrasts with the collective behavior of midges  .",
    "this implies that swarming agents can control and limit the number of social connections as an alternative way to achieve near - criticality while preserving long - range ordering .",
    "furthermore , the fact that members of a swarm with higher susceptibility have statistically higher survivability when confronted with predators suggests a plausible mechanism by which natural selection could pressure some collectives to maximize susceptibility , thereby favoring organisms capable of tuning their social activity .",
    "natural swarms confronted with predator attacks is but one example of a collective system performing a dynamical consensus protocol .",
    "consensus and cooperation in networked multi - agent systems is a topic that is starting to receive significant attention in control theory and distributed computation owing to the numerous possible engineering applications  @xcite .",
    "gaining insight into the consequences of excessive interagent connectivity on the overall performance of a system is not just critical to our understanding of animal collective behaviors , but also to our ability to design artificial swarms . for instance , the power grid , urban traffic , arrays of distributed sensors , and social networks are various examples of collective systems requiring an effective response to local perturbations .",
    "swarming spp models are not general enough to describe such a wide range of systems , and some of their particularities may not apply to other collective systems . for instance , these models typically have an interaction network that is dynamic  @xcite and contingent to the consensus dynamics itself  @xcite , a network distance closely related to the concept of physical distance  @xcite , and dynamics heavily influenced by non - deterministic noise components .",
    "therefore , a more general dynamical model  the linear threshold model  has been used to further study the influence of excessive connectivity on the dynamic response to local perturbations .",
    "we have chosen the polarization speed @xmath95 introduced in eq .   as the metric to quantify the collective responsiveness of interconnected agents .",
    "we have found that @xmath95 depends both on the outdegree and the topology of the interaction network ( see two significantly different topologies in fig .  [ voters ] : a random network and a regular ring ) . however , the polarization speed is maximum when each agent makes a decision based on the information provided by exactly 10 other agents irrespective of the topology of interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ voters ] .",
    ") we did not assert exhaustively the validity of this claim for any arbitrary topology .",
    "nonetheless , it is reasonable to assume than most realistic examples of complex networked systems possess a network structure somewhere in between the two extreme cases considered here  @xcite . a systematic study of the polarization speed for a wider collection of complex networks will reveal how the short - time response of a system is related to other properties of the interaction network such as degree distribution , average shortest connecting path , and clustering coefficient  @xcite .    models based on lti dynamics provide a powerful tool for understanding how the network of interagent connections  and the amount of connectivity in particular  affects the system s performance .",
    "they are minimalist and basic enough to allow for a full analytical study of the responsiveness while embodying the essential ingredients of cooperative multi - agent systems . indeed , our analytical calculations of the responsiveness of a system governed by a distributed leader - follower linear consensus unveil , for a given range of perturbation frequencies , trends very similar to those observed with both the spp model and the linear threshold one .",
    "specifically , there exists a finite level of interagent connectivity that maximizes the metric used to characterize the the system s responsiveness  be it the capacity to follow an input signal , the susceptibility , the survivability to a predator attack , or the polarization speed .    from an engineering standpoint , such as the design of artificial swarms",
    ", this analysis highlights that the pace of typical perturbations that the system is supposed to handle is central in defining appropriate levels of interagent connectivity .",
    "when subjected to slow - changing perturbations , the system s effectiveness always benefits from a higher level of connectivity . comparing with earlier observations , one can deduce that in the low frequency regime , the system does not require high correlation strengths for good propagation of the signal , but it does benefit from an increase in speed that higher correlation length scales provide . on the other hand , fast perturbations inevitably reduce the system s effectiveness with increasing interagent connectivity . extending the comparison",
    ", this suggests that in the high frequency regime , a high correlation strength is paramount for the signal to be effectively transmitted throughout the entire system .",
    "the fact that all the models of collective response studied here consistently exhibit a negative effect associated with an excess of connection or interaction is an indication that this may be a general feature of a wide range of complex systems .",
    "this may shed a new light on our understanding of animal group behavior , but also has clear implications for the design of networked systems . even ignoring the possible costs of establishing connections and transmitting information between agents",
    ", it may be desirable to limit the number of connections in order to achieve a more effective dynamical response .",
