    "in most geophysical and astrophysical flows , turbulence is affected by forces that distort significantly some of its scales in an anisotropic manner , such as the lorentz force arising from the presence of an external magnetic field in a conducting fluid .",

    "this well - known phenomenon , which is linear and characterized by a joule timescale @xmath76 , is responsible for the initial growth of @xmath73 observed in figure [ fig : b33](a ) .",
    "let us define angular energy spectra defined by @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the torus - shaped volume defined from @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 the fourier space discretization steps ( blue domain in figure [ fig : scheme_ezh ] ) .",
    "@xmath86 is the geometrical weighting function such that the angular spectra collapse in isotropic turbulence .",
    "torus - averaged angular spectra @xmath70 have already been used in the context of rotating turbulence @xcite and are similar to the so - called ring decomposition @xcite . on figures [ fig : spang_lrm ] , we present the angular spectra for five orientations from the equator ( @xmath72 ) to the pole ( @xmath87 ) , for @xmath41 ( figures [ fig : spang_lrm](a ) and ( b ) ) and @xmath26 ( figures [ fig : spang_lrm](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "in addition , we distinguish the poloidal and toroidal spectra @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and the linear simulations from the nonlinear ones ( figures [ fig : spang_lrm](a)(c ) and figures [ fig : spang_lrm](b)(d ) respectively ) .",
    "the figures show that almost all the energy is concentrated in the equatorial spectrum , as a result from the linear joule dissipation , independently on the poloidal or toroidal contributions , and in both the linear and nonlinear simulations",
    ".        the reasons for the observed differences between the latter two cases are two - fold : _ ( a ) _ the nonlinear downscale energy cascade increases the energy in the small scale range of the nonlinear runs with respect to the linear ones ; _ ( b ) _ in the meantime , a nonlinear angular transfer kicks in , explaining the polar energy depletion , in the same figures , for the linear runs ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . given that polar modes contribute only to the horizontal kinetic energy ( clearly from geometrical reasons , see fig.[fig : scheme_ezh ] ) combined with a more efficient joule dissipation in the same region , this linear mechanism is responsible for the rapid decrease of horizontal energy , _",
    "i.e. _ rapid _ increase _ of @xmath52 , observed at short times on fig.[fig : b33](a ) .",
    "there is however nothing in this mechanism that explains the decay , of @xmath74 in the nonlinear simulation results plotted on fig.[fig : b33](b ) .    the crucial difference between linear and nonlinear simulations in figures [ fig : spang_lrm ]",
    "is brought to light by the poloidal - toroidal decomposition . at the equator in the full dns ,",
    "the horizontal kinetic energy ( also @xmath89 at this specific orientation ) is dominant at large scales , whereas the vertical kinetic energy ( also @xmath88 ) is dominant at small scales .",
    "this result explains the increase of horizontal kinetic energy with respect to the vertical energy , hence the decay of @xmath74 .",
    "it is clearly of nonlinear origin since it disappears when nonlinear interactions are removed ( see figures [ fig : spang_lrm](a ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "although already observed in previous works @xcite , this unpredicted dominance of horizontal energy was not understood .",
    "we provide here a more precise analysis since only modes such that @xmath90 appear to have noticeably different poloidal and toroidal energies .    .",
    "the nonlinear results are represented in continuous lines and linear results in symbols . ]      in short , the anisotropic lorentz force is responsible for a preferential dissipation leading to a turbulent flow independent of the vertical direction ( see figure [ fig : visus](b ) ) ; this linear effect concentrates the kinetic energy among horizontal modes , as attested by the growth of @xmath73 .",
    "then , due to nonlinearity , the energy is anisotropically distributed among poloidal and toroidal components leading to a nonzero polarization and negative @xmath74 .",
    "the quasi - static mhd turbulence is however far from being purely two - dimensional .",
    "although the flow tends to be invariant in the vertical direction , ( and is even dominant in the linear regime ) .",
    "this state is often referred to as two - dimensional , three - components ( 2d-3c ) or  two - and - a - half - dimensional \" turbulence @xcite .",
    "we now propose a simple description of the above results on directional anisotropy and polarization .",
    "we first write the navier - stokes equations for a flow independent of the vertical direction @xmath22 , so that @xmath91 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the horizontal velocity component and @xmath94 the horizontal gradient . in both equations",
    ", the lorentz force disappears altogether .",
    "eq.([eq : nsuz ] ) for the vertical velocity is that of a passive scalar , whereas eq.([eq : nsw ] ) for horizontal velocity is characteristic of 2d turbulence .",
    "one therefore expects an inverse energy cascade for the horizontal velocity ( or at least a strongly attenuated direct cascade ) and a classical direct cascade for the vertical velocity .",
    "this is consistent with the results observed on figures [ fig : spang_lrm](b ) and ( d ) since the slope of the toroidal ( _ i.e. _ horizontal ) component is steeper than the slope of the poloidal ( _ i.e. _ vertical ) component for horizontal modes ( _ i.e. _ at the equator ) .",
    "thus , we explain the large - scale dominance of horizontal energy as a result of 2d - like cascade for the horizontal velocity .",
    "the vertical component behaves like a passive scalar , and is therefore characterized by a direct cascade so that the vertical energy is dominant at small scales .",
    "note that this effect has nothing to do with a restoration of isotropy , even if @xmath52 tends to its isotropic value .    to assess the validity of this analysis , we perform two additional simulations .",
    "first , we compute the evolution of hydrodynamic turbulence from an initial 2d-3c state and a resolution of @xmath95 .",
    "figure [ fig:2d-3c](a ) shows that @xmath96 during all the simulation . as in quasi - static mhd turbulence ,",
    "2d-3c turbulence is characterized by a negative polarization indicating a dominance of toroidal kinetic energy with respect to the poloidal one .",
    "figure [ fig:2d-3c](b ) shows the equatorial toroidal and poloidal energy spectra @xmath97 ( bottom of the figure ) that again exhibit a dominance of toroidal energy at large scales and the opposite at small scales , in support to our previous analysis on the final state of quasi - static mhd turbulence .",

    "( b ) equatorial energy spectra @xmath98 .",
    "red / top : quasi - static 3d mhd using @xmath25 fourier modes .",
    "blue / bottom : 2d-3c simulation using @xmath95 fourier modes ( shifted down by two decades ) . ]    secondly , we would like to validate the universality of the mechanism at higher reynolds number mhd turbulence , by performing a quasi - static simulation at @xmath99 , using @xmath25 fourier modes .",
    "we choose the case @xmath26 and @xmath100 . in this 3d simulation",
    ", the crossing of the toroidal and poloidal spectra ( top spectra in figure [ fig:2d-3c](b ) ) appears as in figures [ fig : spang_lrm](b ) and ( d ) and in the previously described 2d-3c spectra .",
    "the @xmath101 and @xmath102 slopes are plotted for comparison with common scalings of 2d turbulence with passive scalar @xcite , again showing clearly that the energy cascade is more efficient for the toroidal energy than for the poloidal one , resulting in a steeper slope for toroidal kinetic energy .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the transition from 3d isotropic turbulence to 2d-3c turbulence is subtle .",
    "it combines the anisotropic joule dissipation , which is a linear phenomenon , and nonlinear energy transfers .",
    "if nonlinearities are neglected , this final state is characterized by a dominance of vertical kinetic energy @xcite . however , from the quasi-2d state arising from joule dissipation , nonlinearity induces different dynamics for toroidal / horizontal velocity components and for poloidal / vertical components .",
    "the horizontal flow behaves like 2d turbulence whereas the vertical flow behaves like a passive scalar .",
    "accordingly , the energy cascade ( and thus the dissipation ) is more efficient in the vertical direction , explaining the overall dominance of horizontal energy .",
    "we have also shown that the poloidal / toroidal decomposition and the distinction between directional and polarization anisotropy are fundamental to explain these physical phenomena .",
    "this description may help to explain the large scale anisotropy of some geophysical or astrophysical conducting fluid flows , with the possibility of coupling the 2d-3c model for the large scales to a specific turbulence closure at small scales , thus allowing to achieve very high reynolds number simulations ."
