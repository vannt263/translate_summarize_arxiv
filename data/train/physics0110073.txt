    "the phenomenology of mixing due to the rayleigh - taylor instability , the instability of an interface separating fluids of different densities subject to gravity ( @xcite and references therein ) , can be summarized as follows : bubbles ( spikes ) of lighter ( heavier ) fluid penetrate into the heavier ( lighter ) fluid , and leave behind them a region of mixed fluid . as the instability enters the nonlinear regime , fluid motions in this mixing region become highly irregular .",
    "the envelope , or edge , of the mixing region is observed to be defined by fast large - scale motion , which tend to be dominated by the merging of expanding smaller bubbles ( spikes ) .",
    "the irregular fluid motions within the mixing zone are often regarded as  turbulent \" in the sense that the flow is chaotic in the wake of the bubbles ( spikes ) .",
    "a principal focus of experimental and theoretical study has been the general properties of this mixing zone , whose broadening in time is commonly characterized by the  envelope velocity \" @xmath0 and the penetration lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( for bubbles and spikes , respectively ) . using simple analytical models for the interpenetration of the two fluids , one can show ( @xcite and references therein ) that in the nonlinear regime @xmath3 is proportional to time @xmath4 , and that the penetration depths @xmath5 are proportional to @xmath6 and depend linearly on the gravitational acceleration @xmath7 and the atwood number @xmath8 [ @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the density of the heavier ( lighter ) fluid , respectively ] , i.e. ,    @xmath11    @xmath12 can be thought of as a measure of the efficiency of potential energy release ; experimental measurements of @xmath12 give results in the range of @xmath13 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "most recently , @xcite show that @xmath12 lies in the range of @xmath14 for an atwood number of @xmath15 ; as the reynolds number is high ( @xmath16 ) in these linear electric motor ( lem ) experiments , the instability enters the nonlinear regime within several e - folding times ( @xmath17 ms ) , so that the above scaling law seems to hold from the time that the first few measurements of mixing zone width are made .",
    "there are many possible reasons for the observed variation of @xmath12 found in the literature , when scaling of the form eq .",
    "( [ scaling_law ] ) is observed during the experiment or simulation .",
    "setting aside problems such as incompletely controlled experiments or insufficiently resolved computations , it is important to establish whether the nonlinear ( long - time ) evolution of the instability is sensitive to details in the experiment such initial conditions ; and to what extent one can really talk about universal scaling of the mixed layer width .",
    "these questions have been addressed to some extent in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite has studied the variation of @xmath12 with time during the course of r - t evolution ; he reported that larger values of @xmath18 occur during the early phase of the 3-d problem , before any development of small - scale turbulence ; however , as small - scale motions develop , @xcite reports that the 3-d growth rate slows to that characteristic of the 2-d case ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is also found that @xmath12 may depend on the atwood number @xmath8 as @xmath20 ( g. dimonte , private communication ) . in a variation on this theme ,",
    "it has been observed in simulations that @xmath12 can depend on dimensionality : @xmath12 for three - dimensional calculations is found to be larger than from 2-d simulations . @xcite",
    "have found @xmath12 for three - dimensional calculations to be at least @xmath21 times higher than for 2-d simulations ( in spherical systems ) ; and more detailed phenomena can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found larger values for @xmath12 in 3-d only during the early nonlinear stage , and showed that as small scale 3-d turbulence developed , the 3-d growth slows to that of the 2-d case , similar to results reported by @xcite .",
    "other 3-d numerical simulations , including investigations of single - mode initial perturbation ( @xcite ) and more general initial perturbations ( @xcite ) , obtain a range of values for @xmath12 generally restricted to @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we also explore the dependence of the rt instability on dimensionality .",
    "we focus on quantitative comparisons between two and three dimensions , and these comparisons provide more complete insights to the understanding of rt instability . in the case of experiments conducted with gases , it has also been shown that the interface perturbation growth can be measurably affected by mass diffusion effects between the two layers @xcite .",
    "these experimental and computational results argue strongly that the precise value of @xmath12 is sensitive to a variety of details in the experiments , ranging from the specific nature of the initial state to the dimensionality of the perturbation .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to initiate a study of this issue : in this paper we consider some of the effects which influence the actual value of the scaling coefficient @xmath12 as the rayleigh - taylor instability develops in time ; a central question we address is whether a single scaling regime is always to be expected during the course of non - linear rayleigh - taylor development .    in order to make our study more tractable ,",
    "we have focused only on the low atwood number regime .",
    "the advantage of this regime is that numerical techniques developed for incompressible flows can be readily applied to flows satisfying the boussinesq equations ; such computations are substantially more economical than calculations of the fully compressible problem , and thus allow a more extensive exploration of the parameter space other than atwood number .",
    "physically , our calculations correspond to , for example , cases in which the density contrast is introduced by the distribution of a scalar field ( e.g. , salt or temperature ) , for which the atwood number is usually small because the density varies weakly with the scalar  concentration \" .",
    "species or temperature diffusion occurs in such systems , and is therefore included in our simulations ; we are therefore considering the miscible version of the rayleigh - taylor instability ; in this boussinesq approximation , the atwood number @xmath22 and yet @xmath23 is a finite constant .",
    "an essential element in computations in this regime is that the calculations remain fully resolved throughout the evolution of the instability .",
    "this important constraint limits the range of allowable prandtl number @xmath24 ( ratio of viscosity to thermal diffusivity ) or schmidt number @xmath25 ( ratio of viscosity to species diffusivity ) in our calculations ; we typically take these ratios to be of order unity . @xcite and @xcite have adopted similar ideas in their earlier studies of immiscible rayleigh - taylor instability ; however , in their case , the density is not coupled to a scalar field , and the buoyancy term in the boussinesq navier - stokes equations ( induced by the sharp density gradient across the interface ) is the only term related to the weak stratification .",
    "there are unfortunately few experimental studies of this regime : @xcite have studied the miscible rayleigh - taylor instability experimentally , and via simulations . in their experiments , they place a layer of brine above a layer of fresh water , separated by an aluminum barrier .",
    "the experiment is initiated by sliding the barrier horizontally through one sidewall ; the atwood numbers in their experiments are in the range of @xmath26 ( as the density contrast due to the brine concentration is small when compared to the ambient density ) and the schmidt number @xmath25 is @xmath27 .",
    "their experimental estimates for @xmath12 are around @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite also performed numerical simulations for an atwood number @xmath29 , and ( numerical ) schmidt number of order unity . after imposing various perturbations at the interface , and determining @xmath12 as a function of the ratio of the initial displacement of the fluid to the perturbation wavelength",
    ", they concluded that the smaller this ratio is , the higher the value of @xmath12 .",
    "these authors argued that the removal of the barrier in the experiment corresponds to a long wavelength perturbation at the interface , and therefore the comparison between numerical simulation and experiments makes sense only if the long wavelength perturbation is included as part of the initial perturbation in the simulation . by implication",
    ", they thus suggest that the value of @xmath12 obtained even in the long - time limit can depend on the initial conditions ; in other words , these systems have long - term memory that is not erased by turbulent motions within the mixing interface .",
    "the dependence of rt instability on the initial conditions has recently been studied by @xcite . in this paper , we focus on a study of the physical effects which determin @xmath12 , and in particular investigate effects which lead to a departure from simple @xmath6 scaling of the mixing zone depth .",
    "a detailed study of the scaling law itself is now in progress , and led by g. dimonte ( the @xmath12 group ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we first formulate the problem , outline the numerics , and present evidence for the convergence and accuracy of our calculations . in the following section (  3 )",
    "we summarize our results for multi - mode interface perturbations .",
    "we next discuss existing ( analytical ) models relevant to our studies (  4 ) , which motivate a synthesis of a new model ; the following section (  5 ) we explore these ideas in more detail via numerical studies of isolated plume evolution in both 2-d and 3-d .",
    "our results are discussed in   6 , while our conclusions are presented in   7 .",
    "we consider two vertically stacked fluid layers of different density , governed by the boussinesq equations in a rectangular box ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt periodic boundary conditions along the horizontal directions ; the top and bottom boundaries are no - flux and no - slip . under the boussinesq approximation",
    ", density variations only appear in the buoyancy term , and are small when compared to the mean density .",
    "there are a variety of ways of achieving a small density jump across the horizontal inerface : one may choose gasses of slightly different mean molecular weight , or a single fluid into which a ` contaminant ' is added ( such as temperature , sugar or salt in water ) which changes the fluid s density slightly .",
    "such vertical density variation depends linearly on temperature ; colder ( heavier ) fluid sinks and warmer ( lighter ) fluid floats as gravity points downwards .",
    "thus , in our formulation , the density jump across the interface is replaced by ( for example ) a temperature difference : colder fluid on top of warmer fluid .",
    "the equations for the miscible , incompressible , rayleigh - taylor instability in the boussinesq limit are then essentially the incompressible navier - stokes equations coupled to an advection - diffusion equation for the ` contaminant ' , here temperature : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath32 is the volumetric expansion coefficient , and @xmath33 is the thermal diffusivity . )  we remark that the initial , unperturbed temperature profile diffuses on the diffusion time scale .",
    "we further remark that one could alternatively treat the case of weak stratification via a vertically - imposed salinity ( or any other type of concentration ) gradient ; in this way , one is able to explore a wide range of prandtl / schmidt numbers .",
    "there can be a variety of top and bottom boundary conditions for the scalars , such as fix values or fix fluxes at the boundaries . in our simulations",
    ", we adopt no - flux boundary conditions , which are typical in a run - down experiment .",
    "it is important to note here that since our equations allow for temperature diffusion , they are equivalent to systems in which the ` contaminant ' is salt and allow for saline diffusion , or to systems describing two miscible fluids of slightly different density and allow for mass diffusion .    in our simulations , we are interested only in regimes where the thermal diffusion time is much longer than the dynamical time scales of interest .",
    "the reason for this constraint is as follows : unlike the case of immiscible rayleigh - taylor instability , the presence of thermal diffusion formally does not allow for a static background temperature profile prior to any perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , as we perturb the temperature at the interface , we find that if the diffusivity is sufficiently small , then the initial growth of the perturbation is exponential and thus mimics the linear regime in standard stability analyses for which an initial static equilibrium exists .",
    "thus , long thermal diffusion times are essential if the dynamics is to be dominated by the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the same kind of argument applies in the saline case , or in the case where mass diffusion can occur .",
    "thus , we do not expect to see diffusion effects as reported by @xcite ; and our results indeed show that at least in the linear regime , our growth rates are the same as in the inviscid nondiffusive case .",
    "our problem is defined by a number of distinct spatial and temporal scales : the perturbation wavelength(s ) @xmath34 ( for single - mode perturbation ) or spatial perturbation spectrum ( for multi - mode perturbation ) , the amplitude of the initial displacement of the fluid at the interface @xmath35 , and the initial interface thickness @xmath36 .",
    "two timescales are of most interests here : the dynamical time defined by the free - fall time and the scalar diffusion time . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on cases where the dynamical time scale is much smaller than the diffusion time scale . in this limit ,",
    "the diffusive interface between the hot and cold material remains more or less fixed at width @xmath37 throughout the evolution ; the computation s spatial resolution is then required to at least resolve this interface throughout the calculation .",
    "furthermore , we impose perturbations of amplitude @xmath38 such that @xmath39 in order to capture the initial perturbation properly .",
    "finally , the range of atwood numbers we explore is consistent with values obtained in laboratory experiments for the miscible rt instability ; and the ratio of viscosity to diffusivity is kept to values greater than or equal to @xmath40 .",
    "we have used two distinct numerical codes to solve the above equations , based on our desire to insure that our results are independent of the computational method used to solve equations ( [ 3d - ns])-([thermalad_eq ] ) .",
    "we have compared both the mixing zone extent and the evolution of fluid structures ( obtained from these two codes ) , as to determine the fidelity of our calculations : the two codes lead to results within expected range of errors for the same initial conditions and boundary conditions .",
    "= 2.0 in    the first code is based on the use of pseudospectral methods to simulate the rt instability .",
    "the spatial discretization is fourier in the periodic , horizontal directions and chebyshev in the gravitational direction .",
    "the temporal discretization is 3rd order adams - bashforth for the nonlinear terms and crank - nicholson for the laplacian terms .",
    "we use werne s tau - correction scheme to achieve incompressibility ( @xcite ) ; the code is parallelized using mpi ( @xcite ) , and has been run on the cray - t3e supercomputer at psc .",
    "the second code is based on the spectral element method ( @xcite ) .",
    "it combines the spectral accuracy / efficiency and the geometric flexibility of finite elements , and has been widely applied to a variety of problems .",
    "figure [ code_comparison_rt ] ( a ) demonstrates the satisfactory agreement between the two codes .",
    "we plot the penetration depth @xmath41 of the single mode perturbation as a function of time @xmath42 .",
    "the solid line is from spectral - element code , and the dashed line is from spectral code .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath43 by @xmath44 and the spectral element code has an equival number of total grid points for this comparison .",
    "the average difference in @xmath41 is as small as @xmath45 . by comparing results between spectral - element and spectral code ,",
    "we have validated the usage of spectral code in this particular situation , where the small transitional region from one fluid density to another may undermine the spectral convergence .",
    "in addition to the code - code comparison , we have also performed standard convergence tests on the spectral code when applied to the miscible rt simulation to assure ourselves of the spectral convergence with the presence of a thin interface .",
    "we obtain the expected spectral convergence if the interface is smooth and well resolved . the ideal density discontinuity ( or , in our case , a sharp temperature jump ) can not be resolved in spectral codes without special treatment ; we therefore use a hyperbolic tangent or an error function for the background temperature field to make sure that the initial temperature field is smooth . from the smoothness of the interface",
    ", we obtain spectral convergence as long as we resolve the interface . figure [ code_comparison_rt ] ( b )",
    "shows the spatial convergence of the spectral code when we fix the interface thickness and use single mode perturbation as the initial condition .",
    "the convergence test for the spectral element code is conducted separately for the orr - sommerfeld equation as shown in table [ conv_table ] .",
    "the convergence is non - monotonic due to the fact that the growth rates oscillate about the analytical value .",
    "however , spectral convergence is clearly attained .",
    "having demonstrated the validation of the spectral code , we present results from simulating the system with the spectral code in the rest of the paper .",
    "we adjust both the resolution and the interface thickness so that there are enough grid points across the background temperature profile .",
    ".spatial convergence of the spectral - element code for the orr - sommerfeld problem : @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the energy of the perturbation at @xmath48 , the one period of oscillation for the ts wave .",
    "@xmath49 is the error in energy when compared to theory , and @xmath50 is the error in growth rate . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        @xcite utilized the vortex sheet strength to describe the evolution of single mode perturbations in 2d immiscible rt instability . in the case of miscible r - t instability",
    ", one can construct a family of isothermal contours due to the diffusivity ; we can monitor the evolution of single plumes by evaluating various quantities ( such as vorticity , thermal flux ) on the isothermal ( or , in boussinesq fluids , isodensity ) contours .",
    "= 3.0 in    as long as the structure of the isothermal contours remains relatively simple ( as shown in panel ( a ) of figure [ ap_2dsingle_plume ] ) , we can gain some understanding of the structure of the buoyant plumes by considering the evolution of various physical quantities along the isothermal surfaces .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the spatial structure of the planar vortex pair for the first set of parameters in table 2 .",
    "the roll - up structure is reminiscent of those observed in the weakly stratified , immiscible r - t instability ( @xcite ) . to make complete comparison , we first introduce the circulation ( @xmath51 ) along some closed curve : the circulation @xmath51 , defined as the line integral of the flow along a closed curve , @xmath52 is related to the evolution of vortex pair as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the surface enclosed by the curve @xmath55 . in the case of weakly stratified rayleigh - taylor instability ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the above relation is modified by replacing the right - hand - side integral with the potential energy density due to the interfacial density contrast .",
    "the propagation velocity @xmath56 of the vortex pair in a nonstratified fluid is then related to the circulation @xmath51 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is basically the correlation length for vortices , and is a function of geometry and dimensionality : one expects @xmath58 for 2-d vortex pairs to be larger than for 3-d vortex rings .",
    "equation ( [ v_vort ] ) is valid even in the case of weakly stratified r - t instability , where vortices , originally initiated at the interface due to the density perturbation , propagate in a uniform ambient background . with equation ( [ v_vort ] ) , we can connect the bubble model to the point vortex model via the buoyancy - drag plume model . to fix ideas",
    ", we first outline an evolutionary scenario for the weakly stratified , miscible r - t instability : as we disturb the interface with some temperature perturbation , vortices are generated as a result of lateral thermal gradient .",
    "thus some initial circulation is seeded inside the vortices and a propagation velocity is acquired according to equation ( [ v_vort ] ) .",
    "the circulation then evolves according to equation ( [ circ_vort ] ) , and the propagation velocity is approximately given by equation ( [ v_vort ] ) at each time step for an updated circulation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also observe that the acceleration experienced by the vortex pair is proportional to the increase / decrease rate of change of circulation @xmath51 .",
    "combining equations ( [ circ_vort ] ) and ( [ v_vort ] ) , we obtain the equation for the acceleration for the planar vortex pair : @xmath59 where @xmath7 in equation ( [ vort_acc_s ] ) is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath60 is a function of density contrast ( @xmath61 ) and geometry of the interface ( unit tangent vector along the interface @xmath62 ) .    for point vortices ( @xcite ) , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the unit vector along the gravitational direciton and @xmath62 is the unit tangent vector along the interface . in our case",
    ", we expect @xmath60 to be a constant ( effective acceleration ) plus some correction term due to viscous drag .",
    "this expectation rises from two facts : the first is the observation that the plume consists of a vortex pair inside the cap and a flow sustaining the vortex structure ( the neck connecting the cap to the stem ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the dynamics of the vortex pair to be similar to the plume dynamics .",
    "the second fact is that the propagation of buoyant plumes ( not sustained by a constant source ) in a homogeneous fluid is described by the buoyancy - drag model ( equation [ b_drag_01 ] ) , where the constant density difference across the plume boundary provides buoyancy acceleration , and the viscous drag experienced by the plume causes a deceleration . to be more specific ,",
    "we expect @xmath60 to take the following form : @xmath65 where the  constant \" @xmath12 may depend on the dimensionality and the initial perturbation , and the correction terms are included in the function @xmath66 ( a function of viscosity @xmath31 , the propagation velocity @xmath67 and the density difference @xmath61 ) .",
    "if @xmath66 is chosen to be proportional to @xmath68 as in @xcite , the propagation velocity will reach a constant terminal velocity ( @xmath69 is a constant ) after a free falling period ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) . to fully establish the correspondence between the immiscible point vortex model and the miscible plume model , we calculate the circulation @xmath51 along isothermal contours ( not necessarily closed ) in our 2-d simulations .",
    "= 2.0 in    figure [ circu_depth ] ( a ) shows the temporal evolution of @xmath51 along @xmath72 , and during @xmath73 , we find @xmath51 to be proportional to @xmath74 . comparing with figure [ circu_depth ] ( b ) , we note that this duration coincides with the free falling phase when @xmath41 scales to @xmath74 .",
    "this is similar to what is observed in @xcite : the propagation of the 2-d vortex pair is free - falling at the beginning , and it decelerates due to the decrease of available potential energy per unit arclength as the rollup continues ( and also due to diffusion and viscous dissipation in our case ) - thus the decrease in circulation inside the vortex pair .",
    "we also note that , the constant initial acceleration rate of @xmath51 even in the miscible case indicates that the initial circulation is due to the buoyancy - driven flow around the cap head . as the circulation increases , drag becomes important and the circulation saturates to a maximum .",
    "the circulation then decreases at late times due to the strong enhancement of the horizontal motion , which is typical of 2-d flow and less so in 3-d flow ( we will discuss this difference later ) .",
    "we should point out here that , despite the similarities already presented between point - vortex model and plume model , there exists an essential difference : the plume has a stem structure associated with the circulation around the neck , which closely resembles the flow in the vicinity of rt  fingers \" .",
    "our future research problem is to understand how the presence of multiple plumes affects the circulation near the necks ; this will be an important future step in connecting these models to the rt finger evolution in more vigorous flows ( higher reynolds numbers ) .",
    "we are now ready to compare the vortex structure between the miscible r - t instability and the immiscible version . from panel ( b ) of figure [ ap_2dsingle_plume ] , we obtain the following observations :    * ( 1 ) * the vorticity vanishes at the tip of the cap head .",
    "this implies that the flow near the cap is essentially irrotational , and explains why the potential flow assumption adopted in the derivation of the cap shape by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) works so well in describing the head shape .",
    "this is also consistent with results for the weakly stratified , inviscid r - t instability ( @xcite ) .    *",
    "( 2 ) * the vorticity reaches extrema near the neck of the plumes , i.e. , near the part of the plume which connects the stem and the cap head ; this is the location where circulation is most vigorous .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that circulation reaches extremum at the inflection points along the interface ( @xcite ) .    *",
    "( 3 ) * the amplitude of the thermal gradient reaches extrema either near the cap heads or near the neck of the plumes .",
    "this is consistent with the previous observation , because the larger the thermal gradient is , the larger the rate of circulation is , and thus the vorticity reaches extrema at these points .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the details of the single plume structures to uncover the physical ingredients essential to model the rt fingers . as in the point vortex model",
    ", we find the evolution of arclength of isothermal contour to be indicative of the detailed evolution of the plume structures . here",
    "we first focus on the evolution of the isolevels associated with single plumes .",
    "secondly we explore the dependence of the single plume evolution on the various parameters such as the amplitude of the perturbation , the reynolds number and the prandtl number .",
    "= 2.0 in    figure [ al_2dsingle_plume ] is an example of how the arc length evolves as a function of time for different levels from the 2-d simulation ( run number 4 in table 2 ) .",
    "these are the time evolution of arc length for @xmath75 different isothermal contours .",
    "these various evolutions in the isothermal contours can shed light on the detailed , local structure of the fluid .",
    "first we observe that , among all the @xmath75 curves , curve @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) has the longest curve length .",
    "curves @xmath78 in figure [ al_2dsingle_plume ] correspond to isolevels near the boundary between the plume and the ambient fluids . before @xmath79",
    ", the flow inside the plume pushes these levels upward as the plume rises . from @xmath79 on",
    ", these contour levels begin to catch up with the ascending boundary of the plume to the heavy fluid , and the level sets break up into several smaller connected loops . after this event ( at @xmath80 ) , the plume has established its own shape and the cap propagates in a shape - preserving fashion . at time",
    "@xmath81 , small vortex pairs near the original interface begin to roll up to bigger vortex pairs and thus the increase in arc length .",
    "curves @xmath82 represent transition contours inside the plume .",
    "the sudden drop at @xmath83 correspond to the shedding of smaller vortex pairs .",
    "curves @xmath84 represent the evolution of the levels near the boundary of the ascending plumes , and peaks in each curve represent break - offs of isolevel curves .",
    "we now focus on how the penetration depth @xmath41 grows in time , and how this temporal evolution depends on various control parameters in the simulations .",
    "figure [ h_2dsingle_plume ] shows curves of @xmath41 versus @xmath42 for our 2-d simulations .",
    "we first note that at early time , the ascending @xmath41 ( top panel of figure [ h_2dsingle_plume ] ) does scale with @xmath74 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "= 3.5 in = 3.0 in    after @xmath87 , the plumes have reached a terminal velocity and therefore travel at a constant speed , which is often observed in plumes without sustaining sources .",
    "we further note that the higher the reynolds number , the faster the plume penetrates ( cf .",
    "curve 1 and curve 2 ) .",
    "we also observe faster penetration as we increase the diffusivity ratio @xmath88 ( cf .",
    "curve 2 and curve 3 ) , which is a direct result of weaker stabilization for smaller diffusivity .",
    "we have also varied the initial perturbation amplitude ( cf .",
    "curves 1 and 4 , and curves 2 and 5 ) : for perturbation of amplitude below @xmath89 of the total box height , we find that the larger the initial perturbation , the faster the plume penetrate .",
    "the penetration depth depends linearly on the initial amplitude until @xmath90 , where nonlinearity may have set in to amplify the dependence on the initial state ( cf .",
    "curve @xmath91 and curve @xmath92 ) .",
    "we also note that the penetration of the heavy fluid into the light fluid remains more or less similar as we vary these parameters .",
    "the strong dependence of the ascending structure on the parameters is not reflected on the dynamics of the descending structures .",
    "this demonstrates that , with this form of initial perturbation , the ascending structures have different dynamics than the descending structures despite the low atwood number adopted under the boussinesq approximation .",
    "this is certainly not the case if we perturb the interface with symmetric disturbances .",
    "= 3.0 in = 4.0 in    in this section we present results from simulations of both 2-d and 3-d single plumes for the first set of parameters in table 2 .",
    "the differences between 2-d and 3-d plumes are manifested in various aspects . in figure [ 2d_vs_3d_spstructure ]",
    "we display the plume structures ( at the same penetration depth ) in both 2-d and 3-d .",
    "we also compute various quantities along the isothermal contours , and basically the same spatial structures are found in the 3-d plumes : the vorticity goes to zero at the cap head , the maximum circulation occurs around the neck , and positions of where temperature gradient have extrema are also points where the vorticity have extrema .",
    "the only discernible difference between 2-d and 3-d is the magnitude : the 3-d thermal gradient has higher maximum at the cap head , and the advective heat transport ( both vertical and horizontal components ) in 3-d is much smaller compared to the 2-d heat transport .",
    "the latter ( difference in the efficiency of heat transport ) explains the thinning of the 2-d stem as opposed to a constant width of the 3-d stem observed in our simulations . from our simulations , we also conclude that , for the same parameters , the cylindrically symmetric plumes ( our 3-d plumes ) travel much faster than the planner plumes ( our 2-d plumes ) .",
    "= 2.0 in    as seen in figure [ 2d_vs_3d_spheight ] , the penetration depth in 3-d increases faster with time than in the 2-d case , and eventually reaches almost 2 times the 2-d penetration depth at the end our our simulations . in order to understand this difference , we have calculated the temporal evolution of the ratio of total kinetic energy to the potential energy , and the partition of kinetic energy ( which we break up into its two components , namely the total kinetic energy associated with vertical motions and with horizontal motions ) .",
    "thus , in figure [ 2d_vs_3d_spenergetics ] ( a ) we plot the energetic ratio versus @xmath42 , and show the evolution of the kinetic energy partition as a function of time in figure [ 2d_vs_3d_spenergetics ] ( b ) .",
    "= 2.0 in    first , we point out that the rate of conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy is roughly the same in 2 and 3-d .",
    "secondly , we note that partitioning of the kinetic energy into horizontal and vertical components is different in 2 and 3-d ( with a larger fraction of the kinetic energy going to horizontal motions in the 2-d case ) . based on these facts",
    ", we can now attribute the increased effectiveness of plume penetration in three dimensions to the fact that while more potential energy is released per unit time in 2-d than in 3-d , the partitioning of the resulting kinetic energy into its components drastically favors the directed vertical component in 3-d , but not in 2-d . into the vertical component of the flow kinetic energy , so that the 3-d plumes go faster and penetrate deeper in the same amount of time than their 2-d counterparts .",
    "we apply the plume model to our single plume simulations and find  good \" agreement as we fit the penetration depth @xmath41 to the model ( in the sense that the absolute error is less than @xmath93 over the whole evolution ) .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure [ circu_depth](b ) , where the dashed line is the least square fit for the free - falling law , and the dash - dotted line is the least square fit for the plume model .",
    "we clearly see that the plume model captures the whole evolution , and the deviation is small compared to the @xmath74 fit .",
    "= 2.0 in    when we apply the plume model to the random case [ penetration3_plumefit ] , the existence of three evolutionary phases prohibits a physically meaningful fit for the whole duration of the evolution , and a reasonably good fit is found for early evolution : @xmath94 , where the effective acceleration from this fit is @xmath95 .",
    "as shown in figure [ penetration3_plumefit ] , the evolution deviates from the fit at @xmath96 , right after the beginning of the mixing phase as discussed in  3 .",
    "this is an indication that the interaction of plumes with the background flow is substantial enough to arrest the free falling propagation of the mixing zone . to incorporate this interaction with the background flow into the single plume model",
    ", one needs an equation for the energy evolution of the plume , and also an additional momentum term in equation [ b_drag_01 ] to describe the momentum transfer between the horizontal motion and the vertical motion .",
    "the interaction between plumes , such as merging , also has important contribution to the evolution of plumes as they expand in size and getting closer to each other .",
    "this is a challenging future direction and is currently under investigation .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations in both 2-d and 3-d with relevant length scales arranged such that the thickness of the interface between the two fluids remains the same throughout the simulations .",
    "we have found dramatic differences between 2-d and 3-d flows with the aid of average quantities .",
    "we first perturb the rt interface with  random \" perturbations and investigate the evolution of the mixing zone in both 2 and 3-d with the aid of averaged quantities .",
    "scaling of the mixing zone width with @xmath74 is found in both 2 and 3-d , but only during selected intervals of time .",
    "moreover , we find the 3-d mixing zone expands two times faster than the 2-d mixing zone .",
    "an important finding in this respect is that we can identify three phases of evolution for the 3-d mixing zone : the first is the free - falling phase right after the linear growth period ( after @xmath97 e - folding times ,  3 ) , the second is the mixing phase where the free falling slows down and more mixing is generated as a result of enhanced horizontal motions , as illustrated in  3 ; the third is another free falling phase during which the broading of the mixing zone resumes the @xmath74 scaling , when the big plumes near the edge become decoupled from the mixing zone and propagate on their own .",
    "whether all of these phases are observed is likely to depend on the aspect ratio of the experimental domain . in the 2-d single plume case",
    ", we explore the parameters to demonstrate the effect of initial conditions on the broadening of the mixing zone and thus the effective acceleration @xmath12 . through energetic analysis , we are able to attribute the difference between 2 and 3-d flows to the fact that in 2-d , more energy goes into highly correlated horizontal and vertical motion ( i.e. , vortical motions ) than into directed motions along the gravitational direction ( 3-d ) .    we have discussed two analytic rayleigh - taylor models relevant to our computations ( the bubble - competition model ( @xcite ) and the point - vortex model ( @xcite ) , which are effectively two extreme limits of the 2-d incompressible rt instability from the point - source point of view .",
    "the essential physical features found in both models are also key constituents of the buoyant - drag plume model , in which each single plume experiences an acceleration due to the density contrast , and also a deceleration , which is due to a combination of viscous drag and the horizontal shear flows in the ambient background .",
    "we discuss how the plume model serves to connect the two models on physical grounds , and point out that the plume model actually contains more physical features , such as the coupling of the plumes with the mixing zone via the interaction between a background flow ( inside the mixing zone ) and flows in the stems of the plumes ( whose heads are pushing the envelope of the mixing zone ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that for the miscible vortex pair , both circulation @xmath98 and penetration depth @xmath99 scale with @xmath74 for the same duration of time .",
    "this illustrates the close connection between the plumes and the point vortex pairs .",
    "in addition , we also strengthen the connection by comparing the evolution of rt interface in the miscible case with that in the immiscible case .",
    "the extension of the single plume model to multi - plume systems is of great interest and is now under investigation .",
    "the success of the buoyant - drag model is an indication of the fundamental physical ingredients of the rt instability .",
    "each bubble can be considered as an internal point source , and the curvature of the bubble evolves according to the internal source strength and the relative position of the internal source to the bubble boundary .",
    "the internal point source is fed by the flow from below the bubble , namely the stem connecting the cap head of the bubble .",
    "the coupling of the stem with the background flow , then , determines the strength of the internal source .",
    "all these features are ingredients of the plume model , which is , strictly speaking , an empirical model for plumes in both laminar and turbulent flows .",
    "therefore , we find the buoyant - drag plume model to give an adequate description of the various physical processes that we have observed . the extension of this single plume model to incorporate the coupling of plumes , merger events , and the background flow interaction is challenging and will no doubt bring us more insight into the rt instability .",
