    "the en system is a quasilinear hyperbolic system of pdes that is not manifestly symmetric hyperbolic .",
    "moreover , because of the repeated factors in the expression for @xmath1 in equation below , and because the sheets of the characteristic subset of the cotangent space at @xmath2 intersect ( see fig . [ fi : cotcharsubset ] ) , it is not strictly hyperbolic . therefore , well - posedness for the en system does not follow from either of these two well - known frameworks .    fortunately , alternate techniques recently developed by christodoulou @xcite , and which are applied to the study of relativistic fluids in minkowski spacetime in particular in @xcite , offer a viable approach to studying the cauchy problem for the en system .",
    "the central advantage afforded by christodolou s techniques , which provide energy currents for equations derivable from a lagrangian , is that they bypass the physically artificial requirement of symmetry in the equations : even though the en system is not manifestly symmetric , its energy currents allow for precisely the same energy estimates to be made as in the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems . once one has these estimates , the proof of well - posedness for the en system mirrors the well known proof for symmetric hyperbolic systems .",
