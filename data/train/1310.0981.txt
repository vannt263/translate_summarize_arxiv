    "the paper is devoted to study of integrable equations with two discrete independent variables , of the form @xmath2 where @xmath1 is a fixed positive integer , dependent variable @xmath3 and function @xmath4 take real or complex values .",
    "we define the property of multidimensional consistency for such equations and illustrate it by two examples related with the darboux transformations for spectral problems of order @xmath5 .",
    "recall that , for the so - called _ quad - equations _",
    "@xmath6 3d - consistency means that a generic set of 2-dimensional initial data on a 3-dimensional lattice defines the function @xmath7 which satisfies simultaneously three equations of the form ( [ q1 ] ) , with respect to each pair of discrete variables @xcite .",
    "this automatically implies the consistency on the lattice of arbitrary dimension .",
    "a generalization of this notion for _ multiquad - equations _ ( [ full_qm ] ) is given in section [ s : cons ] .",
    "in this case , the variable @xmath8 is distinguished and the situation is less symmetric : equations of the form ( [ full_qm ] ) are fulfilled with respect to the variables @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the variables @xmath11 correspond to some @xmath1-component quad - equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "symbolically , @xmath14 in the multidimensional lattice , equation ( [ r ] ) satisfies the usual 3d - consistency property with respect to variables @xmath15 others than @xmath8 .",
    "equations ( [ full_qm ] ) appear in the theory of bcklund transformations ( or darboux transformations , on the level of spectral problems ) for evolutionary differential - difference equations @xmath16 where the notation @xmath17 is used .",
    "undoubtedly , most well - known equation of this type is the bogoyavlensky lattice @xcite @xmath18 its bcklund transformation was obtained in papers @xcite ; a detailed account can be found in book @xcite ( an approach based on the discretization preserving hamiltonian structure ) ; among recent publications , we mention @xcite ( a relation with the generalized qd algorithm ) . in section [ s : b ] , we reproduce this bcklund transformation in the form of an equation of type ( [ full_qm ] ) which is consistent with a potential version of the bogoyavlensky lattice . in this context , the variable @xmath8 in ( [ full_qm ] ) is inherited from the lattice equation and @xmath19 enumerates the bcklund transformations .",
    "a new result in section [ s : b ] is the derivation of consistent equation ( [ r ] ) which corresponds to the nonlinear superposition of the bcklund transformations .",
    "this equation turns out to be a @xmath1-component reduction of 3d equation of hirota type .",
    "it should be noted that lattice equations of the form ( [ ut ] ) are well studied only at @xmath20 . in this case ,",
    "an exhaustive classification of equations admitting higher symmetries was obtained by yamilov @xcite .",
    "relation of such lattice equations with quad - equations is also well studied @xcite . at @xmath21 , search of new examples and study of their properties",
    "remain an actual open problem .",
    "the theory of lattice equations ( [ ut ] ) is more complicated than the parallel theory of continuous integrable evolutionary equations ; this is explained by the fact that a single continuous equation may correspond to an infinite family of discretizations of different order .",
    "for instance , the korteweg  de vries equation is obtained under the continuous limit from the bogoyavlensky lattices for arbitrary @xmath1 , and the lattices corresponding to the different @xmath1 are not related to each other and belong to different hierarchies .    in section [ s :",
    "dsk ] , we derive a new example of equation of the from ( [ full_qm ] ) .",
    "it defines the darboux  bcklund transformation for the nonhomogeneous generalization of the bogoyavlensky lattice from our previous article @xcite .",
    "this lattice equation serves as a discretization of the sawada  kotera equation and admits the lax representation with the operator @xmath22 equal to the ratio of two difference operators .",
    "it is interesting that the darboux transformation posesses a similar structure . as in the case of the bogoyavlensky lattice",
    ", the nonlinear superposition principle brings to the consistency with certain @xmath1-component equation of the form ( [ r ] ) .",
    "a point in the multidimensional integer lattice is denoted as @xmath23 .",
    "the last coordinate @xmath8 is distinguished , the shifts @xmath24 with respect to this variable are denoted by the subscript @xmath25 and the zero subscript is omitted , like in equation ( [ ut ] ) . for the other coordinates",
    ", we consider only the unit shifts @xmath26 which are denoted by the superscript @xmath19 . in this notation ,",
    "equation ( [ full_qm ] ) with variable @xmath19 replaced by @xmath27 is written as @xmath28 and this is the form which we will use in what follows .",
    "we assume that this equation is solvable with respect to any of corner variables @xmath29 or @xmath3 , for the generic values of the rest variables involved in the equation .",
    "so , we consider equation ( [ qm ] ) equivalent to equation of the form @xmath30 and analogously for the variables @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the nondegeneracy condition is fulfilled @xmath32 in order to exclude from the consideration equations of the form @xmath33 where each factor depends on incomplete subset of corner variables .",
    "in fact , the examples presented in this paper correspond to the case when @xmath4 is an irreducible polynomial of power 1 with respect to each its argument .",
    "it is easy to see that in such a case all above stipulations are fulfilled .",
    "in addition to the variable @xmath3 defined in the vertices of the integer lattice , we consider also the variables defined on its edges .",
    "a variable associated with the edge @xmath34 is denoted like @xmath35 ( and it should be distinguished from @xmath36 ) .      in both examples ,",
    "the dressing procedure is quite standard ( it is similar to the veselov ",
    "shabat approach in the continuous case @xcite ) . given a discrete spectral problem of order @xmath1 @xmath37\\psi=\\lambda\\psi,\\ ] ] the darboux transformation",
    "is constructed by use of its particular solution @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "it brings , for the function @xmath40 , to the pair of miura type substitutions @xmath41 and the sequence of these substitutions ( a discrete dressing chain ) is described by the equation @xmath42 where tilde is understood as the shift with respect to the second discrete variable .",
    "although this equation belongs to the type ( [ qm ] ) , it _ is not _",
    "3d - consistent in the above sense , because the variables @xmath43 are associated with the edges of the lattice rather than the vertices , and in this situation one should use another definition which generalizes the notion of yang ",
    "baxter mappings , see e.g. @xcite . certainly , both versions of 3d - consistency , for the vertices and the edges , are closely related .",
    "it turns out that equations ( [ uuf ] ) admit introducing of the potential ( due to some conservation law ) @xmath44 and the new variable @xmath3 satisfies an equation of the form ( [ qm ] ) which falls under our definition of consistency . the additional @xmath1-component quad - equation ( [ r ] ) corresponding to the nonlinear superposition of darboux transformations is found from the matrix representation .",
    "it should be remarked that bcklund transformations equivalent to a pair of miura type substitutions are very common , but do not cover all known examples . for instance , this scheme does not contain the quad - equation @xmath45 which is the most general known equation at @xmath20 .",
    "this equation defines the bcklund transformation for the elliptic volterra lattice , and also the superposition of bcklund transformation for the krichever ",
    "novikov equation .",
    "one may expect that analogous examples exist for @xmath21 as well , but these are not discovered yet .",
    "let us consider the 3-dimensional integer lattice @xmath46 and let the real - valued variable @xmath3 defined on the lattice satisfies the @xmath1-quad - equations with respect to each pair of discrete variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 the solution of these equations on the coordinate sublattices @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with the generic initial data @xmath52 can be constructed by solving the equations with respect to the corner variables ( see fig .",

    "we will assume that functions @xmath63 are generic in the sense that this system is not degenerate and possesses a finite set of solutions .",
    "however , this does not guarantee that a solution exists for the whole set of equations ( [ n11 ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if we consider additionally @xmath64 then two new equations for a single new unknown @xmath65 are added , which , generally , do not admit a solution in common .",
    "we are interested in the special type of equations such that a solution of system ( [ n11 ] ) exists for the generic initial data .",
    "notice that expressions for @xmath66 as functions of initial data can contain only @xmath67 indeed , since @xmath66 are found by solving equations ( [ n11 ] ) at @xmath60 , hence these variables do not depend on @xmath68 at @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , these variables can be found by solving equations ( [ n11 ] ) at @xmath70 , and this implies that there are no dependence on @xmath68 at @xmath71 , as well .",
    "therefore , if equations ( [ qq ] ) are consistent then a mapping @xmath72 appears , which can be interpreted as a @xmath1-component quad - equation on the sublattice @xmath73 .",
    "we derived it in the origin of the lattice , but it is clear that this mapping is defined at any point @xmath54 .",
    "this observation brings to the desired formulation of the consistency conditions . in the following definition , equations ( [ qq ] )",
    "are taken in the resolved form ( [ q ] ) ( so that the solution of the 3d - consistent system is constructed in the octant @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) .",

    "[ st : dsk.ft ] equation @xmath218 defines the @xmath8-part of the bcklund transformation for equation ( [ dsk.ft ] ) , that is , the relation obtained by differentiating of this equation in virtue of ( [ dsk.ft ] ) and a similar lattice equation for @xmath219 is fulfilled identically in virtue of the equation itself .",
    "an interesting property of equation ( [ dsk.f ] ) at @xmath220 is that it admits a reduction to an equation of order @xmath221 .",
    "more precisely , one can prove that it can be brought to the form @xmath222 where @xmath4 is a polynomial depending on @xmath223 , so that equation @xmath224 defines a special solution of ( [ dsk.f ] ) .",
    "moreover , equation @xmath224 is also consistent with the lattice equation ( [ dsk.ft ] ) .",
    "for instance , in the simplest case @xmath53 , the quad - equation appears ( a discrete analog of the tzitzeica equation ) @xmath225 which is consistent with the flow @xmath226 equation ( [ b.f ] ) admits an analogous lowering of the order .",
    "refactorization of the above darboux matrices is a rather difficult task .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to write the general answer for arbitrary @xmath1 and we arrive to the following statement .",
    "the proof of 3d - consistency follows from the same general arguments as in the case of statement [ st : b.nsp ] .",
    "[ st : dsk.nsp ] let @xmath227=b^{-1}a$ ] where @xmath228 are matrices of the form ( [ dsk.a ] ) , ( [ dsk.b ] ) and @xmath229 .",
    "then equation @xmath230\\,f[f^{(i)},\\alpha^{(i)},\\lambda ]   = f[t_j(f^{(i)}),\\alpha^{(i)},\\lambda]\\,f[f^{(j)},\\alpha^{(j)},\\lambda]\\ ] ] considered as an identity with respect to @xmath145 is uniquely solved with respect to @xmath231 , for generic values of @xmath35 , @xmath232 .",
    "this gives rise to the @xmath1-component mapping @xmath233 where @xmath234 this mapping satisfies the 3d - consistency property @xmath235    now , the proof of theorem [ th : dsk ] is obtained by introducing of the potential @xmath3 according to equations @xmath236 under these substitutions , equations ( [ dsk.uf ] ) turn into @xmath1-quad - equation ( [ dsk.vi ] ) , the mapping ( [ dsk.tf ] ) turn into @xmath1-component quad - equation ( [ dsk.vij ] ) , and the lattice equations ( [ dsk.ut ] ) , ( [ dsk.ft ] ) turn into equation ( [ dsk.vt ] ) .",
