    "supernovae ( sne ) are associated with the end points of the evolution of particular types of stars .",
    "stars with initial masses @xmath5 are believed to undergo a core - collapse induced explosion at the end of their lives @xcite .",
    "sne are important drivers of the chemical and physical evolution of their host galaxies : distributing heavy elements newly synthesised in the explosion and injecting kinetic and radiative energy into the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "the type of the sn depends on the evolutionary status of the progenitor object just prior to core - collapse .",
    "the observational identification of these objects , and determination of their nature , is of importance to the study of the evolution of massive stars and the evolution of sne @xcite .",
    "+ sne are principally classified by the absence ( type i ) or presence ( type ii ) of hi features in their early time optical spectral .",
    "sne are further sub - classified by other spectral features or the shapes of their light curves .",
    "the type ia sn class is very homogeneous , characterized by the presence of a si ii absorption feature @xcite .",
    "sn ia occur in old - intermediate age stellar populations ( in e , s0 and the bulges of s galaxies ) composed of low - intermediate mass stars .",
    "sn ia are thought to arise from the thermonuclear explosion of either c - o white dwarfs accreting material from a binary companion or the coalescence of two c - o white dwarfs in a close binary @xcite .",
    "the si ii absorption feature is not seen in types ib / c .",
    "sn ib show spectral features due to he , while sn ic are he deficient .",
    "these sne , along with all type ii sne , are seen in young blue star forming regions in the spiral arms of late type galaxies and are associated with massive star progenitors ( @xmath6 ) undergoing a core - collapse induced explosion .",
    "the absence of h , and the subsequent absence of he in sn ic , is associated with increasing mass loss , and hence initial mass , of the progenitor or enhanced mass loss due to a binary interaction @xcite . type",
    "iip / l sne show prominent features due to h. sn iip exhibit a plateau feature in their light curves , due to the expansion and recombination of a large h - rich envelope , as well as h balmer p - cygni profiles in their optical spectra @xcite .",
    "the progenitors for these objects are likely to be stars towards the lower range of the masses that will produce a core - collapse sn , for which mass loss is not significant allowing the h - envelope to be retained .",
    "@xcite presented initial mass limits , from pre - explosion imaging , for a number of type iip sn progenitors , suggesting the progenitors were all stars with initial mass @xmath7 .",
    "the detected progenitor of the iip sn2003gd an m0 supergiant , had an initial mass @xmath8 , consistent with the theoretical minimum initial mass for a core - collapse sn @xcite .",
    "sn iil are thought to arise for slightly more massive stars ( @xmath9 ) for which mass loss is much more important . in these cases",
    "the stars have retained an h - envelope of mass @xmath10 , which is not massive enough to produce a plateau and so the sn light curve decays linearly @xcite .",
    "in addition there are a number of type ii subclassifications which are classified by spectroscopic features .",
    "type iib sne transform from a type ii to a ib sn , of which sn1993j was the class prototype .",
    "the transition is due the retention of thin veil of the h envelope which gives rise to the initial classification of type ii , but upon dissipation transforms to ib .",
    "low velocity iin sne exhibit narrow spectral lines .",
    "this may be due to collision of the sn with a dense circumstellar medium ( e.g. 1998s , @xcite ) or the eruptions of luminous blue variables ( e.g. 1997bs , @xcite ) which appear similar to ccsne .",
    "+ core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) are a heterogenous group due to the different permutations of the explosion . in the cases of single star progenitors",
    "the sequence iip@xmath11iil@xmath11iib@xmath11ib / c @xcite can be considered to be due to increasing initial mass , and hence mass loss during the final stages of evolution .",
    "the outer h rich and subsequently he rich layers are stripped due to the increasing levels of mass loss .",
    "the role of binaries , and in particular mass and angular momentum exchange , provide alternative routes for different mass progenitors to appear as the same sn type @xcite .",
    "the direct determination of the nature of an sn progenitor requires observations of the progenitor prior to explosion . in most cases",
    "this is from fortuitous imaging available from telescope archives which was acquired for some other purpose , but has also imaged the sn location . given the rarity and randomness of ccsne it is necessary to look to nearby galaxies ( @xmath12 ) in order to observe enough events at a feasible rate , coupled with a reasonable probability of detecting the progenitor and resolving it from neighbouring stars .",
    "a multi - wavelength deep imaging survey of nearby galaxies has been undertaken by the authors to improve the likelihood of appropriately deep and high resolution pre - explosion data being available for future nearby sne .",
    "+ in only three cases have the progenitors of definite ccsne , with their parameters fully determined , been identified in pre - explosion frames : 1987a @xcite , 1993j @xcite and 2003gd @xcite .",
    "sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) was noted as a peculiar type ii sn and the progenitor star was identified as sk @xmath13 @xcite a b3ia star .",
    "sn1993j was the prototypical type iib sn , in m81 , and the progenitor was identified as k0ia star with an unknown ultraviolet component @xcite .",
    "neither of these progenitors is consistent with the canonical m - supergiant progenitor predicted for these types of sne . in both cases ,",
    "however , there is evidence that binarity plays a particularly important role . @xcite",
    "describe a binary model for the progenitor of sn 1987a and @xcite report the discovery of a blue supergiant companion to the progenitor of sn 1993j .",
    "the detected progenitor of sn 2003gd was the first red supergiant progenitor observed for a type iip sn . in a number of cases pre - explosion imaging of the sn location",
    "has been available in a number of archives , in particular that of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , but the pre - explosion images were not deep enough to detect the progenitor . in these cases @xcite have placed brightness limits on the progenitors given the limiting magnitude of the pre - explosion frames at the sn position .",
    "the brightness limits have then been translated to mass limits by plotting the detection threshold on the hetrzsprung - russell diagram and determining the mass range for which the progenitor would not have been detected in the pre - explosion image . @xcite",
    "have used post - explosion imaging of the sn , with the technique of differential astrometry , to locate the sn position on pre - explosion images to sub - pixel accuracy . @xcite",
    "have similarly attempted to identify progenitors in pre - explosion imaging .",
    "they have used the reported positions of sne , such as given in iau circulars .",
    "the correct identification of progenitors is limited , however , by the poor pointing accuracy of hst ( requiring the astrometric re - calibration of pre - explosion frames ) and uncertainties in the reported positions of sne .",
    "+ the parameters of the progenitor may also be estimated , using various calibrations , from the evolution of the sn itself .",
    "the light curves and velocity evolution of the sne have been used , with particular theoretical calibrations , to determine the ejected and ni masses @xcite .",
    "epochs of mass loss have been probed by observing the variations in the radio light curves of certain sn due to the interaction of the sn with the progenitor s circumstellar medium@xcite .",
    "direct detection of the progenitor , whilst being a reliable method of determining the progenitor parameters , is also a useful check and calibration for the other techniques for determining the properties of the progenitors from the sn .",
    "+ in this paper we present the search for the progenitors of six nearby ccsne : 3 type iip sne ( 1999an , 1999br and 1999ev ) , 2 type ib sne ( 2000ds and 2001b ) and 1 type ic ( 2000ew ) .",

    "the interpretation of these results is complicated by the different progenitor scenarios which give rise to each ccsn type .",
    "+ the progenitor mass limits for the type ii sne ( 1999an , 1999br and 1999ev ) are consistent with the previously determined mass limits for the type ii - p sne 1999em , 1999gi and 2001du @xcite .",
    "it has been assumed that the progenitors of these sne arise from red supergiant progenitors . only in the case of sn 1999br , however , has a sub - type been firmly established by long term photometric and spectroscopic monitoring @xcite .",
    "reported photometry from amateur observers suggests that 1999an and 1999ev were also type iip sne .",
    "the upper mass limit for the progenitor of sn 1999an does not place a tight constraint on the mass range of progenitors that give rise to type ii - p sne .",
    "previous estimates of the mass of the progenitors of these sne @xcite place the mass in the range @xmath14 .",
    "the observed mass for the progenitor of sn 1999ev shows that type ii - p sne also arise from higher mass progenitors .",
    "this would be inconsistent with the models of @xcite , for sn 1999br , if all such high mass progenitors are predicted to only give rise to faint sne .",
    "+ it has not been possible to place constraining limits on the progenitors of the type i sne ( 2000ds , 2000ew and 2001b ) from their pre - explosion imaging . for sne 2000ew and 2001b",
    "the observations do not explicitly exclude a red progenitor .",
    "the pre - explosion imaging for 2000ds , in both the v and i bands , allows the possibility of a red progenitor to be considered and ultimately excluded . in a single star star scenario",
    "the progenitor would be star with @xmath15 in the wr phase @xcite .",
    "the available pre - explosion f555w",
    "imaging is biassed against the discovery of the hot , low luminosity wr stars , which would require long u and b band imaging to detect .",
    "in addition @xcite describe the evolution of a low mass progenitor ( @xmath16 ) in binaries , stripped by a companion , in the form of a naked helium star .",
    "these would have temperature @xmath17 and would thus appear on the blue side of the hr diagram and would be similarly undetectable .",
    "the location of sn 2000ds , in an s0 galaxy or earlier , strongly suggests that this sn arose in a binary system .",
    "the pre - explosion imaging does not permit the discrimination between sne arising from the high or low mass progenitor scenarios .",
    "the pre - explosion imaging does , however , permit the exclusion of stars on the high mass end of the red / yellow supergiant branch at @xmath18 .",
    "+ the nature of the progenitor just prior to explosion depends on processes such as convection , mass loss , rotation and metallicity at various stages of the stars lives .",
    "the way these processes are implemented in the stellar evolution codes affects the predicted properties of the progenitors .",
    "@xcite notes the inclusion of convective overshooting reduces the initial mass for the progenitor of sn 2003gd from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the utilisation of different mass loss prescriptions also causes differences between the predictions of different stellar evolution codes .",
    "the non - rotating geneva stellar evolution code , used here , predicts that increasingly more massive stars ( up to @xmath21 ) should give rise to hotter , more luminous progenitors culminating in a yellow supergiant ( ysg ) progenitor .",
    "more massive stars will undergo a wr phase and will explode as type ibc sne .",
    "@xcite find that , in the mass range @xmath22 , more massive red supergiant progenitors are increasingly more luminous , but slightly cooler .",
    "this is consistent with observations of lmc supergiants by @xcite .",
    "the use of different mass loss prescriptions causes the iip@xmath11iil@xmath11iib@xmath11ibc transition zone to move ( see figure [ snpops ] ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite shows that the inclusion of rotation can lead to ysg , having undergone a blue loop , and blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitors for stars with @xmath23 with rotational velocities of @xmath24 .",
    "pre - explosion observations with the f555w and f606w filters with wfpc2 are not sensitive to bsgs , but do exclude ysg progenitors for this sample of sne .",

    "this has enabled the correct identification of the progenitor position in crowded regions on the pre - explosion imaging and the exclusion of nearby stars as candidates for the progenitor @xcite . in two cases , however ,",

    "target of opportunity override programs with hst will be utilised to acquire the necessary post - explosion imaging for future nearby ccsne to provide confident identification of progenitors .",
    "the analysis of the progenitors of the objects studied here was limited by the depth and spectral coverage of the pre - explosion data available ( generally short single filter images ) .",
    "programs to acquire deep multi - wavelength imaging of nearby galaxies are currently underway , to improve the chances of detecting the progenitors and analysing their parameters .",
    "we have presented mass estimates for six progenitors of ccsne , from pre - explosion hst wfpc2 observations .",

    "the observed progenitor of sn 1999ev shows that high mass stars ( @xmath25 ) can give rise to normal type ii - p sne .",
    "our study of sn 1999br has shown that this faint sn arose from a low mass progenitor , in the same initial mass range as the progenitor of sn 2003gd , rather than a high mass progenitor .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility of high mass progenitors , such as that of sn 1999ev , giving rise to peculiarly faint sne .",
    "+ the mass limits for the progenitors of the type i ccsne ( 2000ds , 2000ew and 2001b ) do not disagree with the predictions that these should arise from very high temperature wr stars . in this",
    "study the mass limits determined have assumed a single progenitor scenario . in the case of sn 2000ds a binary progenitor",
    "is much more likely , being consistent with both the lack of detection of the progenitor in the red and the age of the stellar population of ngc 2768 .",
