    "for an extended system such as the bowties manufactured in this study , the plasmon resonances can be characterized as traveling surface waves with a continuous distribution of wavevectors .",
    "a series of calculations of bowties with increasing length reveals that the optical spectrum is characterized by increasingly densely spaced plasmon resonances in the wavelength regime 500 - 1000  nm and a low energy finite - size induced split - off state involving plasmons localized on the outer surfaces of the bowtie . for a large bowtie",
    ", we expect the plasmon resonances in the 500 - 1000  nm wavelength interval to form a continuous band [ s2 ] .",
    "the electric field enhancements across the bowtie junction for the plasmon modes within this band are relatively similar with large and uniform enhancements in the range of 50 - 150 .",
    "the magnitudes of the field enhancements were found to increase with increasing size of the bowtie structure .",
    "for instance , the maximum field enhancement factor was found to be 115 for a 200  nm bowtie ( each half of the bowtie is modeled as a truncated triangle 200  nm long . ) and 175 for a 400  nm bowtie .",
    "our use of a finite gridsize also underestimates the electric field enhancements[s3 ] .",
    "thus our calculated electric field enhancements are likely to _ significantly underestimate _ the actual electric field enhancements in the experimentally manufactured bowties .    for a perfectly symmetric bowtie ,",
    "significant field enhancements are only induced for incident light polarized across the junction .",
    "if the mirror symmetry is broken , for instance by making one of the structures thicker or triangular , large field enhancements are induced for all polarizations of incident light .    to investigate the effects of nanoasperities ,",

    "4 of the main text , and figs .",
    "s5-s7 of the supporting online material .",
    "as expected , the presence of these protrusions does not influence the optical spectrum .",
    "however , the local field enhancements around the protrusions become very large , typically three or four times higher than for the corresponding structure without the defect . the physical mechanism for this increase",

    "<S> this substrate is sensitive enough to examine such contaminants ( see supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> while clean junctions with no deliberately attached molecules initially show only the continuum background , gap - localized sers signatures in the @xmath12 carbon region between 1000  @xmath11 and 1600  @xmath11 are readily detected after exposure to ambient lab conditions for tens of minutes . </S>",
    "<S> nanojunctions that have been coated with a self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) ( for example , @xmath4ma ) do _ not _ show this carbon signature , even after hours of ambient exposure . presumably this has to do with the extremely localized field enhancement in these structures , with the sam sterically preventing physisorbed contaminants from entering the region of enhanced near field </S>",
    "<S> .    recently arrived contaminant sers signatures abruptly disappear within tens of seconds at high incident powers ( 1.8  mw ) , presumably due to desorption . </S>",
    "<S> sers from covalently bound molecules is considerably more robust , degrading slowly at high powers , and persisting indefinitely for incident powers below 700  @xmath13w . </S>",
    "<S> sem examination of the nanogaps shows no optically induced damage after exposure to intensities that would significantly degrade nanoparticles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large extended pads likely aid in the thermal sinking of the nanogap region to the substrate .    estimating enhancement factors rigorously is notoriously difficult , particularly when the hotspot size is not known . </S>",
    "<S> although sers enhancement volume measurements are possible using molecular rulers@xcite , this is not feasible with such small nanogaps . </S>",
    "<S> junctions made directly on raman - active substrates ( si with no oxide ; gaas ) show no clearly detectable enhancement of substrate modes in the gap region , suggesting that the electromagnetic enhancement is strongly confined to the thickness of the metal film electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows a comparison between a typical @xmath4ma sers spectrum acquired on a junction with a 600  s integration time at 700  @xmath13w incident power , and a spectrum acquired over one of that device s au pads , for the same settings . </S>",
    "<S> the pad spectrum shows no detectable @xmath4ma features and is dark current limited .    </S>",
    "<S> we use fdtd calculations to understand the strong sers response in these structures and roughly estimate enhancement factors . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the finite grid size ( 2  nm ) required for practical computation times restricts the quantitative accuracy of these calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the main results regarding spatial mode structure ( allowing assessment of the localization of the hotspot ) and energy dependence are robust to these concerns , and the calculated electric field enhancement is an _ underestimate_@xcite . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows a calculated extinction spectrum and map of @xmath14 in the vicinity of the junction . </S>",
    "<S> calculational details and additional plots are presented in the supporting information . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations predict that there should be large sers enhancements across a broad bandwidth of exciting wavelengths because of the complicated mode structure possible in the interelectrode gap . </S>",
    "<S> nanometer - scale asperities from the electromigration process break the interelectrode symmetry of the structure . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that optical excitations at a variety of polarizations can excite many interelectrode modes besides the simple dipolar plasmon commonly considered . for extended electrodes , </S>",
    "<S> a continuous band of plasmon resonances coupling to wavelengths from 500 - 1000  nm is expected@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this broken symmetry also leads to much less dependence of the calculated enhancement on polarization direction , as seen experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations confirm that the electromagnetic enhancement is confined in the normal direction to the film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> laterally , the field enhancement is confined to a region comparable to the radius of curvature of the asperity . for gaps and asperities in the range of 2  nm , purely electromagnetic enhancements can exceed @xmath15 , approaching that sufficient for single - molecule sensitivity .    using the data from the device in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we estimate the total enhancement in that device . to be conservative , </S>",
    "<S> we assume a hotspot effective radius of 2.5  nm with dense packing of @xmath4ma , giving @xmath16 molecules . blinking and wandering suggest that the true @xmath17 value is much closer to one . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated raman signal over a gaussian fit to the 1077  @xmath11 raman line is 2.0 counts / sec / molecule when the incident power is 700  @xmath13w . for our apparatus </S>",
    "<S> the count rate from imaging a bulk crystal at the same equivalent power ( see supporting information ) is @xmath18 counts / sec / molecule , so that we estimate a total enhancement of at least @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated a sers substrate capable of extremely high sensitivity for trace chemical detection . unlike previous substrates , these nanojunctions may be mass fabricated in controlled positions with high yield using a combination of standard lithography and electromigration . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting hotspot geometry is predicted to allow large sers enhancements over a broad band of illuminating wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> other nonlinear optical effects should be observable in these structures as well . </S>",
    "<S> the extended electrode geometry and underlying gate electrode are ideal for integration with other sensing modalities such as electronic transport </S>",
