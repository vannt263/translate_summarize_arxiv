    "the standard method to analyze solar neutrino data in terms of neutrino oscillations consists in performing a least - squares fit .",
    "however , for the reasons described in section  [ standard ] the standard least - squares analysis of solar neutrino data is approximate from a statistical point of view .",
    "in this paper we present statistical methods based on monte carlo numerical calculations that allow to improve the implementation of the least - squares fit of solar neutrino data . in section  [ standard ]",
    "we review the standard method and we discuss why its approximate assumptions could lead to significant inaccuracy in the results . in section  [ gof ] we present a monte carlo method that allows to calculate the goodness of fit of solar neutrino data . in section  [ cl ]",
    "we present a monte carlo method that allows to calculate the confidence level of the usual allowed regions in the space of the neutrino oscillation parameters . in section  [ exact ]",
    "we present an implementation to solar neutrino analysis of the classical frequentist neyman method that allows to calculate exact confidence regions with correct coverage .",
    "since the purpose of this paper is to illustrate different methods for the statistical analysis of solar neutrino data , we consider for simplicity only the data relative to the total rates measured in the homestake @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite experiments , and the weighted average of the total rates measured in the two gallium experiments gallex @xcite and sage @xcite .",
    "the values of these rates are given in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite . updated results of the super - kamiokande experiment and first results of the new gno experiment have been presented in the recent neutrino 2000 conference @xcite .",
    "since the numerical calculations presented here take a long time and were started before the neutrino 2000 conference , we do not take into account the new data .",

    "traditionally solar neutrino data have been analyzed in terms of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that determine the probability of neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that the parameter @xmath5 is more convenient for finding the allowed regions in the interval @xmath6 when matter effects are important @xcite has been employed in the framework of three - neutrino mixing and the parameter @xmath7 has been employed in the framework of four - neutrino mixing @xcite . ] . moreover",
    ", the parameter @xmath8 allows a better view of the regions at large mixing angles with respect to the usual parameter @xmath9 .",
    "hence , in the following we analyze the solar neutrino data in terms of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "our calculation of the theoretical event rates follows the standard method described in several papers for matter - enhanced msw @xcite transitions and vacuum oscillations .",
    "we calculate the msw survival probability of @xmath10 s in the sun using the standard analytic prescription and the level - crossing probability appropriate for an exponential density profile @xcite .",
    "we calculate the regeneration in the earth using a two - step model of the earth density profile , that is known to produce results that do not differ appreciably from those obtained with the correct density profile .",
    "we have used the tables of neutrino fluxes , solar density and radiochemical detector cross sections available in bahcall s web page @xcite . for simplicity we have neglected the matter effects that slightly affect the vacuum oscillation solutions of the solar neutrino problem , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the traditional way to find the values of the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 allowed by solar neutrino data is to perform a least - squares fit , often called `` @xmath11 fit '' . in this method",
    "the estimates @xmath12 , @xmath13 of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 are obtained by minimizing the least - squares function @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the covariance matrix of experimental and theoretical uncertainties , @xmath16 is the event rate measured in the @xmath17 experiment and @xmath18 is the corresponding theoretical event rate , that depends on @xmath3 and @xmath5 .    the standard method for the calculation of the covariance matrix @xmath15 is the one presented in refs .",

    "notice that , since the theoretical rates @xmath41 depend on @xmath3 and @xmath5 , also the covariance matrix @xmath15 depends on @xmath3 and @xmath5 .    in the traditional method",
    "the minimum @xmath42 of ( [ x2 ] ) provides the estimate of the neutrino oscillation parameters , usually called `` best - fit values '' , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the goodness of the fit is estimated by calculating the probability to observe a minimum of @xmath43 larger than the one actually observed assuming for @xmath42 a @xmath11 distribution with @xmath44 degrees of freedom , where @xmath45 is the number of experimental data points ( the sums over @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq .",

    "if @xmath50 is larger than a minimum acceptable value , usually @xmath52 , the fit is considered to be acceptable and one can proceed further to determine the uncertainties in the determination of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( the allowed regions in parameter space ) .",

    "the gaussian distribution of experimental and theoretical uncertainties seems to be widely accepted , although it is not clear if this assumption is appropriate for the theoretical errors . on the other hand",
    "it is clear that    1 .",
    "the theoretical rates @xmath18 do not depend at all linearly on the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 .",
    "this is the reason why there are several allowed regions in the @xmath5@xmath3 plane ( or the more traditional @xmath4@xmath3 plane ) and these regions do not have elliptic form ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath15 is not constant , but depends on @xmath3 and @xmath5 , as remarked after eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the errors @xmath69 are not multinormally distributed , because although the fluxes @xmath71 and the cross sections @xmath34 are assumed to be multinormally distributed , their products ( [ rij ] ) , that determine the theoretical rates through the relations @xmath72 are not multinormally distributed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the usual method of calculating the goodness of fit and the allowed regions in the @xmath5@xmath3 plane is not guaranteed to give correct results , _",
    "i.e. _ the goodness of fit could be significantly different from @xmath51 and the confidence level of the regions enclosed by borders with constant @xmath73 could be significantly different from @xmath53 .",
    "we believe that the largest correction is due to the non - linear dependence of the theoretical rates @xmath18 from the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 , that causes the existence of more than one local minima of the least - squares function @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that there are more possibilities to obtain good fits of the data and the true goodness of fit is likely to be smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "also , in repeated experiments the global minimum has significant chances to occur far from the true ( unknown ) value of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 , with a smaller probability that the allowed regions cover the true value with respect to the linear case .",
    "hence , we expect that the true confidence level of a usual @xmath53 cl allowed region is smaller than @xmath56 .    in the following sections of this paper we perform a least - squares fit of the solar neutrino data using the @xmath42 estimator for the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 .",
    "we assume the usual gaussian distribution for the experimental and theoretical uncertainties . in section  [ gof ]",
    "we calculate the goodness of fit using the monte carlo method , that is applicable in any case in which the distribution of the uncertainties is known ( see , for example , section  15.6 of @xcite ) . in section  [ cl ]",
    "we calculate with the monte carlo method the confidence level of the usual allowed regions in the @xmath5@xmath3 parameter space . in section  [ exact ]",
    "we implement the classical frequentist neyman method for finding exact confidence regions with correct coverage at a given confidence level .",
    "in order to calculate the goodness of fit , our method proceeds as follows ( see , for example , section  15.6 of @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the best - fit values of @xmath3 , @xmath5 through the minimum of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) and we call these best - fit values @xmath12 , @xmath13",
    ". then we assume that @xmath12 , @xmath13 are reasonable surrogates of the true values @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the probability distribution of the differences @xmath76 , @xmath77 is not too different from the true distribution of the differences @xmath78 , @xmath79 in a large set of best - fit parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) obtained with hypothetical experiments .",
    "using @xmath12 , @xmath13 as surrogates of the true values , we generate @xmath83 synthetic random data sets with the usual gaussian distribution for the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we apply the least - squares method to each synthetic data set , leading to an ensemble of simulated best - fit parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 with @xmath86 , each one with his associated @xmath87 .",
    "then we calculate the goodness of the fit as the fraction of simulated @xmath87 in the ensemble that are larger than the one actually observed , @xmath42 .",
    "we calculate the synthetic data sets generating random neutrino fluxes @xmath88 with a multinormal distribution centered on the ssm fluxes @xmath32 and having the covariance matrix @xmath89 we also generate random energy - averaged cross sections @xmath90 with a multinormal distribution centered on the theoretical energy - averaged cross sections @xmath34 corresponding to @xmath12 , @xmath13 and having the completely correlated covariance matrix for each independent experiment @xmath91 @xmath92 then , we calculate the rates @xmath93 .",
    "finally , we generate random synthetic experimental rates @xmath94 with normal distribution centered on @xmath95 and standard deviation equal to that of the actual experimental data ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the synthetic experimental rates are inserted in the least - squares function ( [ x2 ] ) in place of @xmath16 in order to find the minimum @xmath87 and its associated best - fit parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the results of our calculations are reported in table  [ gof ] .",
    "the global minimum of the least - squares function ( [ x2 ] ) , @xmath97 , occurs in the sma region , @xmath98 , lma for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , low for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , vo for @xmath103 . ] for @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the results reported in the `` sma '' row of table  [ gof ] have been obtained taking @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we first restricted the allowed region of the mixing parameters around the sma region ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) and obtained the local value of the goodness of fit , reported in the `` local '' column of table  [ gof ] .",
    "this value is almost equal ( even slightly larger ) to the standard one obtained assuming a @xmath11 distribution with one degree of freedom , reported in the `` standard gof '' column of table  [ gof ] .",
    "hence , we conclude that locally the usual method to evaluate the goodness of fit is reliable",
    ".        however , when we extend the allowed region of the mixing parameters to all the msw region @xmath110 and when we add also the vo region @xmath111 we obtain the values reported , respectively , in the `` msw '' and `` global '' columns of table  [ gof ] , which are significantly smaller than the one obtained with the standard method . as remarked in section  [ standard ] , this is due to the non - linear dependence of the theoretical rates from the neutrino oscillation parameters , that implies that there are more possibilities to obtain good fits of the data with respect to the linear case .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the standard method , although valid locally ( when the allowed region of the parameters is restricted around the sma region the linear assumption is approximately correct ) , is not valid in general and should not be trusted if there is more than one allowed region .    in order to check the local validity of the standard method",
    "we have also assumed that @xmath12 and @xmath13 have the values corresponding to the local minima of @xmath43 in the lma , low and vo regions , restricting the allowed values of the parameters around the corresponding regions .",
    "the results are reported in the `` lma '' , `` low '' and `` vo '' rows of table  [ gof ] .",
    "one can see that the standard method is locally acceptable for the lma and low solutions , but it largely overestimates the goodness of fit in the case of the vo solution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the theoretical rates are highly non - linear functions of the neutrino oscillation parameters in the vo region ( [ vo ] ) , resulting in several disjointed allowed regions .",
    "the `` msw '' and `` global '' entries in the `` lma '' , `` low '' and `` vo '' rows of table  [ gof ] are empty because it is meaningless to calculate the goodness of fit allowing values of the parameters in which the fit is better than the one in the assumed surrogate of the true values of the parameters .    summarizing the results of this section",
    ", we have shown that if there were only one allowed region in the space of the neutrino oscillation parameters , or if there are valid reasons to restrict the allowed region of the parameters around one of the sma , lma , low solutions , the standard method to calculate the goodness of fit is approximately reliable .",
    "on the other hand , if there are more than one allowed regions , the standard method to calculate the goodness of fit is not reliable and the goodness of fit must be calculated numerically , with monte carlo , as we have done .",
    "this happens if one considers the msw region ( [ msw ] ) of the neutrino oscillation parameters , which contains three allowed regions ( sma , lma and low ) , or the vo region ( [ vo ] ) , that contains several allowed regions , or all the parameter space ( msw+vo ) .",
    "in order to calculate the confidence level of the allowed regions it is necessary first to understand what is its meaning .",
    "the @xmath53 cl allowed regions are defined by the property that they belong to a set of allowed regions obtained with hypothetical experiments and the regions belonging to this set cover ( _ i.e. _ include ) the true value of the parameters with probability @xmath56 .    given the usual `` @xmath53 cl '' allowed regions in the space of the neutrino oscillation parameters we can calculate their confidence level @xmath112 with a method similar to the one described in the previous section for the goodness of fit .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 , @xmath13 are reasonable surrogates of the true values @xmath74 , @xmath75 and we generate a large number of synthetic data sets .",
    "we apply the standard procedure to each synthetic data set and obtain the corresponding `` @xmath53 cl '' allowed regions in the space of the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "then we count the number of synthetic `` @xmath53 cl '' allowed regions that cover the assumed surrogate @xmath12 , @xmath13 of the true values .",
    "the ratio of this number and the total number of synthetically generated data set gives the confidence level @xmath112 of the `` @xmath53 cl '' allowed regions .",
    "the results of our calculations are reported in table  [ cl ] .",
    "as we have done in the previous section for the goodness of fit , we calculated first the local confidence levels restricting the allowed values of the parameters around the region whose local minimum of @xmath43 gives the assumed surrogates of the true values ( `` local '' column of table  [ cl ] ) .",
    "then we calculated the confidence levels restricting the allowed values of the parameters to the msw region ( [ msw ] ) assuming the surrogates of the true values in the local minima of @xmath43 of the sma , lma and low regions ( `` msw '' column of table  [ cl ] ) .",
    "finally , we calculated the confidence levels without any restriction on the allowed values of the parameters , assuming the surrogates of the true values in the local minima of @xmath43 of the sma , lma , low and vo regions ( `` global '' column of table  [ cl ] ) .",
    "one can see that the values of the confidence levels calculated locally for the sma region , where the global minimum of @xmath43 lies , practically coincide with the standard ones ( `` standard cl '' column of table  [ cl ] ) . however , when the allowed values of the parameters are extended to the whole msw region ( [ msw ] ) or to the msw and vo regions ( global ) , the confidence levels are significantly smaller than the standard ones .    the same trend , slightly more pronounced , is observed when the surrogates of the true values of the parameters are assumed to correspond to the local minima of @xmath43 in the lma and low region , with even a small deviation of the local confidence levels from the standard ones ( with unpredictable sign ) .",
    "when the surrogates of the true values of the parameters are assumed to correspond to the local minimum of @xmath43 in the vo region ( [ vo ] ) , the confidence levels are significantly smaller than the standard ones , even those calculated locally .",
    "this is due to the fact that the linear approximation used in the calculation of the standard confidence levels is badly violated ( there are several disjointed allowed vo regions with non - elliptical shapes ) .    summarizing the results of this section",
    ", we have shown that the standard confidence levels of the allowed regions in the neutrino oscillation parameter space are approximately correct if only one of the sma , lma or low region is considered to be allowed a priori . if the oscillation parameters are restricted to the msw region ( [ msw ] ) , the confidence levels are significantly smaller than the standard ones , with some uncertainty depending on the assumed surrogates of the true values of the parameters .",
    "if one does not impose any restriction on the values of the parameters , the confidence levels decrease further .",
    "if only the vo regions are considered to be allowed even the confidence levels calculated locally are significantly smaller than the standard ones .",
    "in the previous section we have calculated the confidence level of the allowed regions in the neutrino oscillation parameter space obtained with the standard procedure based on eq .",
    "( [ dx2 ] ) .",
    "this calculation is approximate , because it is based on the assumption of a surrogate for the unknown true values of the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that the value of the confidence level is different if the surrogate for the unknown true values of the neutrino oscillation parameters is assumed to be the value of the parameters in the global minimum of @xmath43 or in one of the local minima .",
    "luckily , there is a well - known procedure for constructing exact _ confidence intervals _ independently of the true values of the parameters .",
    "this procedure has been invented by neyman in 1937 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it guarantees that the resulting confidence intervals have correct frequentist _ coverage _ ( see ) , _ i.e. _ they belong to a set of confidence intervals obtained with different or similar , real or hypothetical experiments that cover the true values of the parameters with the desired probability given by the chosen confidence level . in this section",
    "we apply this method in order to find confidence intervals with proper coverage for the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "neyman s construction of exact frequentist confidence interval with @xmath113 confidence level starts with the choice of an appropriate estimator of the parameters under investigation .",
    "then , for any possible value of the parameters one calculates an _ acceptance interval _ with probability @xmath56 , _ i.e. _ an interval of the estimator that contains @xmath113 of the values of the estimator obtained in a large series of trials .",
    "several methods are available for the construction of the acceptance intervals ( see and references therein ) .",
    "if the probability distribution of the estimator is known , the acceptance intervals can be calculated analytically ; if not , one can calculate the acceptance intervals with numerical monte carlo methods .",
    "in general the acceptance intervals can be composed by disjoint sub - intervals . in the case of @xmath114 parameters",
    "the acceptance intervals are regions in the @xmath114-dimensional parameter space .",
    "once the @xmath113 acceptance interval for each possible value of the parameters is calculated , the @xmath113 confidence interval is simply composed by all the parameter values whose acceptance interval covers the measured value of the estimator ( _ i.e. _ the actual estimate of the parameters ) . if the acceptance intervals are composed by disjoint sub - intervals , also the confidence interval is composed by disjoint sub - intervals . as we will see in the following , this is what happens in the case of solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "our implementation of neyman s construction goes as follows .",
    "first we choose as estimator of neutrino oscillation parameters the values of the parameters in the minimum @xmath42 of the least - squares function ( [ x2 ] ) .",
    "since the probability distribution of the chosen estimator is not known , we calculate it numerically with a monte carlo .",
    "we define an appropriate grid in the 2-dimensional space of the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath5 , @xmath3 and for each value of the parameters on the grid we generate a large number of synthetic data sets . for each data set",
    "we find the value of the parameters corresponding to the minimum of @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure gives the distribution of @xmath42 for each value of the parameters on the grid .",
    "unfortunately this is a rather lengthy task that requires several days of computer time in order to reach an acceptable accuracy , essentially because of the large number of points on a reasonably fine grid , about five thousand in the msw region ( [ msw ] ) and six thousand in the vo region ( [ vo ] ) .    we define the @xmath113 acceptance intervals in the simplest and most natural way : for each value of the parameters we choose the shortest possible acceptance interval , _",
    "i.e. _ that containing the values of the parameters on the grid with highest probability , whose sum is equal or larger than @xmath56 ( in general perfect equality is not reached because of the discrete nature of the grid ) . in the case of a linear least - squares",
    "fit this method gives the allowed regions obtained with the standard prescription ( [ dx2 ] ) . therefore , our exact allowed regions can be compared directly with the standard ones .",
    "the acceptance intervals are 2-dimensional regions in the @xmath5@xmath3 parameter space . because of the non - linearity of the neutrino oscillation probability as a function of the parameters ,",
    "the acceptance intervals are composed by disjoint sub - intervals .",
    "this generates 2-dimensional confidence intervals composed by disjoint sub - intervals , some of which far from the values of the parameters corresponding to the actual @xmath42 .",

    "we have presented the results of a numerical monte carlo calculation of the goodness of fit and the confidence level of the standard allowed regions for the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath3 , @xmath5 obtained from the fit of solar neutrino data . we have shown that the standard values of the goodness of fit and of the confidence level of the allowed regions are significantly overestimated with the standard method .",
    "this is due to the non - linear dependence of the neutrino oscillation probability from the parameters .",
    "the linear approximation , leading to the standard values of the goodness of fit and of the confidence level of the allowed regions , is valid only locally , for values of the parameters around a specific msw solution ( sma , lma , low ) . in the case of the vo solution",
    "the linear approximation is not valid even locally , because of the strong non - linearity of the oscillation probability that causes the existence of several allowed regions close together .",
    "we have also calculated exact allowed regions with correct frequentist coverage using neyman s method .",
    "the results of these calculations show that the standard allowed region around the global minimum of the least - squares function is a reasonable approximation of the exact one . on the other hand , the size of the other regions is dramatically underestimated in the standard method .",
    "indeed , in our calculation the exact sma region , that contains the minimum of the least - squares function , practically coincides with the standard one . on the other hand ,",
    "the exact lma and low regions are much larger than the standard ones , so much that they merge in a huge allowed region around maximal mixing .",
    "also the exact allowed vo regions are much larger than the standard ones .",
    "the indications on neutrino mixing coming from solar neutrino data are becoming increasingly important for theory and experiment .",
    "furthermore , solar neutrino data will soon be enriched by results of new powerful experiments ( sno @xcite , borexino @xcite , gno @xcite and others @xcite ) .",
    "as we have shown , the standard statistical analysis of solar neutrino data can lead to incorrect conclusions concerning the goodness of fit , the confidence level of the allowed regions and the size of the allowed regions far from the global minimum of the least - squares function .",
    "hence , we believe that it is time to examine critically the method of statistical analysis of solar neutrino data and bring it to the level of quality already attained in other branches of research in high - energy physics .",
