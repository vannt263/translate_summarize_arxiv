    "to characterize the entanglement , the notions of separability and inseparability , which are the characteristic properties of state vectors in quantum mechanics , are commonly used . on the other hand ,",
    "the notion of local realism based on local non - contextual hidden - variables models is also used to test the properties such as locality and reduction  @xcite .",
    "local hidden - variables models are generally different from quantum mechanics , and thus local realism tests the deviation from quantum mechanics also .    in the experimental study of local realism , which is commonly tested by chsh inequality  @xcite , it is customary to first confirm the consistency of the measured basic correlation such as the spin correlation @xmath16 with quantum mechanics and then test the chsh inequality .",
    "if one confirms the consistency of @xmath16 for any unit vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 with quantum mechanics , one can naturally apply the criterion of quantum mechanical separability to the correlation . in the present study",
    ", we discuss this aspect of separability test in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is well known that the peres criterion of the positivity of partial transposed density matrix gives a necessary and sufficient condition of separability of general density matrix in @xmath1  @xcite which we study in the present paper .",
    "however , it is also well - known from the days of pauli  @xcite that the reconstruction of the state vector or density matrix from measured data is in general very involved  @xcite .",
    "it is thus practically useful to derive simpler criteria which do not require the precise state reconstruction .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive such separability criteria .",
    "we assume the most general separable density matrix but we use a limited set of two - point correlations and thus obtain only the necessary condition of separability in general .",
    "nevertheless , we illustrate that our criteria are very useful when applied to the past experimental data of aspect et al . in 1981",
    "@xcite and sakai et al . in 2006",
    "@xcite .",
    "to be specific , we study the general separable quantum mechanical states @xmath17 in @xmath18 ; all the states @xmath19 are separable pure quantum states  @xcite .",

    ", we derive the useful criteria of separable mixed states , namely @xmath23 for two spin @xmath7 systems , and @xmath24 for two photon systems with linear polarization projectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively : here @xmath12 .",
    "the basic new ingredient in our derivation of these criteria ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is that we take a geometric _ angular average _ of unit vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 with fixed @xmath11 .",
    "it is shown that this angular averaging , which is originally motivated by the specific experiment  @xcite , does not add a new burden to measurements by analyzing the existing experimental data .",
    "the difference in the numerical coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath7 in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) arises from the difference in rotational properties ; the spinor rotational freedom is 3-dimensional , which agrees with the freedom of the @xmath14 hilbert space , while the rotational freedom of the photon is two - dimensional , which differs from the freedom of the @xmath14 hilbert space since it is confined in a plane perpendicular to the momentum direction .",
    "if one instead takes an average over the states in the @xmath14 hilbert space , the formula for the photon is replaced by @xmath25 this difference between the geometrical angular average and the hilbert space average is interesting , and it has an interesting implication on the separability issue of the werner state  @xcite which accommodates a specific local hidden - variables representation and thus satisfies chsh inequality . in the case of photon , the hilbert space average can judge the inseparability of the werner state but the geometrical angular average can not .",
    "we discuss the separability criterion on the basis of explicit experimental data by aspects et al . in 1981  @xcite and sakai et al . in 2006  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the authors emphasize a good agreement of the measured basic correlation such as @xmath26 or the corresponding quantity for spin operators for any unit vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the predictions of quantum mechanics and then discuss the test of the chsh inequality .",
    "we instead formulate the separability criterion for the two - point function @xmath27 which inscribes much information about quantum mechanics in @xmath1 , and discuss the entanglement from a point of view of separability . + * separability criterion of pure states * : + we begin with the experimental analysis of separability for a pure state .     defined in ( 7 ) measured by aspect s experimental setup in 1981  @xcite .",
    "the dashed line represents the prediction of a separable pure state in ( 2 ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    the experiments , which we use to test saparability , have been performed in the past by freedman and clauser in 1972  @xcite and aspect , grangier and roger in 1981  @xcite ( before the better known experiment in 1982  @xcite ) .",
    "those experiments are based on the measurement of the transverse linear polarization of the photon . to rewrite our relations , which are often written for spin operators , for the analysis of the photon measurement , one may define the projection operator such as @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "the projector @xmath3 in the transverse direction is then _ formally _ identified with the photon linear polarizer in the direction @xmath9 ; chsh inequality based on hidden - variables models is correctly described by this formal replacement , but the properties under the rotation group , for example , can not be correctly described and a more careful treatment is required , as is explained later .",

    "this formulation is motivated by the measurement of two - proton correlation by sakai et al .",
    "they measure a pair of massive spin @xmath7 protons from the decay of the short - lived ( @xmath47 sec ) @xmath48he spin - singlet state  @xcite .",

    "quantum mechanics predicts @xmath50 for the quantity in ( 6 ) .",
    "but the authors in  @xcite actually measured the quantity corresponding to the quantum mechanical correlation @xmath51 with unit vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "they did not measure @xmath54 and @xmath55 separately , and thus we can not construct the quantity @xmath56 defined in ( 6 ) .",
    "they however mentioned that `` thus , a measured value of @xmath57 , which is same as @xmath58 , for @xmath52 and @xmath53 randomly rotated , is strong evidence that the incident two protons are in the entangled state . ''",
    "we thus define a quantity to test the general separable mixed state in ( 1 ) by incorporating the angular average in their measurement .",
    "we start with an arbitrary separable pure quantum state @xmath59 which gives @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 stand for unit spin vectors which define the pure state by @xmath63 $ ] , for example .",
    "the prediction of the separable mixed state in ( 1 ) is thus written as @xmath64 where we use the continuum notation with @xmath65 instead of the discrete one , @xmath66 , in ( 1 ) .",
    "this defines the most general separable mixed states and thus naturally incorporates the positivity of partial transposed density matrix .",
    "we emphasize that the geometrical average of the unit vector @xmath67 covers all the possible spin states in the @xmath14 hilbert space , which becomes crucial when one compares the spin average with the average over photon polarization later .",
    "this quantity becomes @xmath68 after the angular averaging of @xmath52 and @xmath53 with fixed @xmath69 ; note that the angular average means the average with solid angle , namely , @xmath70 .",
    "it is interesting that the separable state gives a non - trivial @xmath71 dependence in @xmath58 .",
    "the quantity @xmath72 in ( 13 ) is defined by @xmath73 which satisfies @xmath12 .",
    "the relation ( 13 ) is the prediction of separable quantum states in ( 1 ) . the measured value in  @xcite , @xmath57 which is same as quantum mechanical prediction  @xcite ( expected in their experimental setting ) , contradicts the prediction @xmath74 and thus clearly shows inseparability .",
    "see fig.2 .     of sakai et al .",
    "@xcite , width=302 ]    similarly , one may consider the angular averaging of the photon case , but the _ angular average _ of the spinor and the photon is different . to analyze this issue , we start with a general quantum state in the @xmath14 fock space , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "the second quantized operator for the photon propagating in @xmath79-direction with @xmath80 is given by ( in @xmath14 subspace by ignoring all the space - time indices ) @xmath81 where one may choose the polarization vectors in the @xmath82 plane as @xmath83 without writing the vanishing @xmath79 component ; @xmath84 states may be termed as @xmath85 and @xmath86 states or @xmath87 and @xmath88 states .",

    "the general separable state may be defined in terms of the states in ( 15 ) by @xmath95 .",

    "this prediction ( 23 ) of the separable mixed state in ( 1 ) that is formulated without assuming a pure state contradicts the experimental result given in ( 7 ) @xmath108 which agrees well with the quantum mechanical prediction  @xcite , and thus the data clearly show inseparability .",
    "see fig.3 .",
    "as for the justification of angular averaging , the authors in  @xcite mentioned that , `` we never observed any deviation from rotational invariance '' . in passing , we mention that the two - photon state expected in the decay of a pseudo - scalar state ( a spin @xmath109 state with negative parity ) @xmath110 in the 4-dimensional notation and proportional to @xmath111 in terms of the transverse potential , @xmath112 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gives @xmath113 in contrast to @xmath114 for the scalar state in ( 9 ) .",

    "width=302 ]    the difference in the numerical coefficients in front of @xmath72 in ( 13 ) and ( 23 ) arises from the fact that the _ geometrical _ angular averaging procedure we perform is 3-dimensional for the spin @xmath7 freedom while it is 2-dimensional for the linear polarization of the photon which is confined in the plane perpendicular to the momentum direction .",
    "one may ask if it is possible to obtain @xmath13 for the photon ?",
    "it is possible if one takes an average in the @xmath14 hilbert space ; one may define the projection operator for the linearly polarized photon using the states in ( 15 ) by @xmath115 instead of ( 19 ) .",

    "if one takes the average over @xmath119 and @xmath120 with fixed @xmath121 one obtains @xmath122 this is the same result as for the spin @xmath7 case in ( 13 ) and one obtains @xmath123=1+\\frac{1}{3}c\\cos\\tilde{\\varphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath124 which is bounded by @xmath12 . in the final expression in ( 32 ) , one may replace @xmath125 to compare it with the previous expression ( 23 ) .",
    "physically , what is involved in the second procedure in ( 32 ) is to consider the average over the states @xmath126 by geometric operations but also by applying the `` phase shifter '' to the state @xmath127 to generate the states with various @xmath128 . since we take an average over a larger class of states , the coefficient in ( 32 ) is made smaller to @xmath13 .",
    "those formulas ( 13 ) and ( 23 ) ( and also ( 32 ) ) provide convenient criteria to test separability without an explicit reconstruction of the state @xmath22 from the measured data .",
    "the angular averaging is required for these formulas to be a test of separability , but it does not appear to be difficult to implement the angular averaging in actual experiments , as the past experiments we discussed indicate  @xcite .",
    "we here mention the well - known werner state  @xcite , @xmath129 with the spin singlet state @xmath49 $ ] , which accommodates a specific hidden - variables representation and thus satisfies chsh inequality .",
    "this state is rotation invariant and gives rise to @xmath130 which violates the separability criterion ( 13 ) and thus inseparable .",
    "the explicit example of the werner state shows that local realism ( local hidden - variables models ) and quantum mechanical separability are logically independent notions .",
    "it is interesting to examine the werner state when it is applied to two photon systems .",
    "if one chooses the state @xmath131 in ( 35 ) as the photon state @xmath132 given in ( 26 ) , one obtains @xmath133 for which we can not judge separability using the criterion ( 23 ) .",
    "this failure of the separability criterion is analogous to the failure of chsh inequality .",
    "instead , we need to consider the projector in ( 28 ) for the werner state , @xmath134 and compare this expression with the separability criterion ( 32 ) to judge the inseparability of the werner state .",
    "( if one uses the photon state @xmath135 in ( 8) , one obtains @xmath136 in ( 37 ) and @xmath137 in ( 38 ) , respectively . )",
    "this analysis suggests that we need to consider a larger class of detector states in ( 28 ) to detect inseparability of the werner state by photon measurements , .",
    "as for the test of separability of general mixed quantum states in ( 1 ) , peres criterion of the positivity of partial transposed density matrix @xmath138 for the original @xmath139 , which gives a necessary and sufficient separability condition for @xmath140 systems  @xcite , can be used in combination with the state reconstruction of two linearly polarized photons such as in  @xcite .",
    "but in practice the reconstruction of the state @xmath22 from the measured data is generally involved  @xcite .",
    "we have instead presented simpler formulas ( 13 ) and ( 23 ) , which incorporate the angular averaging of measured two - point correlations while assuming the most general separable density matrix .",
    "our simplified test of separability nicely works without any extra cost such as the state reconstruction , and the final outcome in fig.1 - fig.3 may be favorably compared with the standard test of chsh inequality  @xcite , although our formula tests separability while chsh inequality tests locality and thus not identical . from the point of view of separability , chsh inequality and our relation ( 2 )",
    "both give the necessary and sufficient condition for any pure state , while chsh inequality and our relations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) both give only the necessary condition for mixed states .",
    "the werner state is tested by our criterion in the case of spin , but in the case of photon one needs the information coming from the hilbert space averaging .",
    "we here mention a past work on the test of entanglement  @xcite which is closely related to the present study .",
    "a comprehensive and comparative study of various separability criteria has been given in  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite show that the separability of the density matrix for a two - spin system is characterized by an algebraic inequality derived from robertson s uncertainty relations for pauli matrices .",
    "the algebraic inequality is shown to give a necessary and sufficient separability criterion for the two - spin system in @xmath1 , and thus the inequality can be used in place of the positivity of partial transposed density matrix .",
    "however , it remains hard to confirm the separability of an unknown state in practice because one has to check the proposed inequality for all sets of local complementary ( non - commuting ) observables , despite of the fact that the analysis in  @xcite ensures in principle a violation of the inequality for any entangled state by choosing properly the local testing observables .",
    "the authors of  @xcite also suggest a simple _ necessary _ condition of separability by just measuring 3 correlations @xmath141 and examining @xmath142 in the case of spin @xmath7 systems .",
    "this condition is based on the equality @xmath143|{\\bf",
    "s}_{1}\\rangle|{\\bf s}_{2}\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is bounded by unity .",
    "the expected initial spin state @xmath49 $ ] in  @xcite gives @xmath144 , and this comparison shows the inseparability of the state @xmath131 and provides information to understand the criterion at @xmath145 in fig.2 .",
    "this analysis , when applied to the test of the inseparability of the werner state @xmath146 in ( 35 ) , leads to the same conclusion as our relation ( 36 ) at @xmath145 ; it is known that @xmath147 is the necessary and sufficient condition of separability if one replaces the coefficient @xmath7 of the singlet state appearing in the werner state ( 35 ) by @xmath148  @xcite , namely , @xmath149 .",
    "for the photon case instead of the spin @xmath7 case discussed in ( 41 ) , one can show the relation @xmath150\\psi(\\theta_{1}/2,\\phi_{1})\\psi(\\theta_{2}/2,\\phi_{2})\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\cos\\theta_{1}\\cos\\theta_{2}+\\sin\\theta_{1}\\cos\\phi_{1}\\sin\\theta_{2}\\cos\\phi_{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of separable wave functions in ( 20 ) , which predicts @xmath151 for the general separable states in ( 20 ) . here",
    "pauli spinors act on the qubit states defined by the photon . in comparison",
    ", one can confirm the relation @xmath152\\psi=2 $ ] for the singlet ( scalar ) wave function @xmath153 in ( 8) , and @xmath154\\psi_{ps}=-2 $ ] for the pseudo - scalar wave function @xmath155 in ( 25 ) .",
    "the comparison of these relations shows the inseparability of both @xmath153 in ( 8) and @xmath155 in ( 25 ) , and it provides information to understand the curves at the point @xmath145 in fig.3 ( if one corrects the overall shift by unity ) , although the geometrical meaning of the correlations in ( 43 ) in the real 3-dimensional space is not obvious",
    ".    it may be interesting to note that the analysis in  @xcite is closely related to the analysis by simon  @xcite who studied the separability criterion for the two - party system with a one - dimensional continuous freedom in each party by writing an algebraic inequality based on the positivity of partial transposed density matrix ; the number of independent linear operators is 4 since the phase space dimensionality is @xmath1 in  @xcite .",
    "the criterion , which provides a necessary and sufficient separability condition for gaussian states in quantum optics  @xcite , has been later shown to agree with an inequality based on kennard s uncertainty relation  @xcite .",
    "it appears that the heisenberg uncertainty principle accounts most of separability criteria in lower dimensional systems .",
    "the test of separability and the test of local realism are closely related in that both test entanglement but there is a crucial difference .",
    "the separability is based on quantum mechanics while the test of local realism is based on local hidden - variables models and thus generally tests the deviation from quantum mechanics also .",
    "the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics and hidden - variables models are based on the notion of _ valuation_. the valuation is defined as the probability measure @xmath156 which assigns non - negative values @xmath157 to any set of complete orthogonal projection operators @xmath158 by preserving the linearity condition @xmath159 .",
    "a general analysis  @xcite shows that such a measure is inevitably given by a trace representation @xmath160 with a suitable trace - class operator @xmath22  @xcite for the dimensions of the hilbert space @xmath161 , and no deterministic ( dispersion - free @xmath162 ) representation of @xmath156 such as in hidden - variables models is possible for @xmath161 .",
    "there is also an analysis  @xcite which asserts that , if one adopts povms , @xmath163 , instead of projection operators , those @xmath164 are jointly measurable in a single experiment  @xcite but no deterministic representation of @xmath156 with @xmath165 ( by maintaining the dispersion - free condition @xmath166 ) is possible even in @xmath14 , while a trace representation @xmath167 of von neumann is always possible .",
    "if one should adopt this last point of view , no sensible local non - contextual hidden - variables models in @xmath1 would be defined .",
    "in such a case , the separability provides an indispensable test of entanglement .",

    "<S> @xmath12 , and the difference in the numerical coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath13 arises from the different rotational properties of the spinor and the transverse photon . if one instead takes an average over the states in the @xmath14 hilbert space , the criterion for two photon systems is replaced by @xmath15 . </S>",
