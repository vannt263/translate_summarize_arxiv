    "most of the investigations made to determine the fundamental properties of low - mass stars using eclipsing binaries indicate a strong discrepancy between theory and observations .",
    "radii measurements of the low - mass stars can be made from the eclipsing binaries plus interferometry of single stars .",
    "these measurements clearly indicate that the observed radii are generally larger than the predictions by the stellar models .",
    "on the other hand the observed temperatures are lower than those of predicted by the models .",
    "this discrepancy , the observed larger radii and lower temperatures , is generally explained by the high level of stellar activity .",
    "accurate parameters of low - mass stars are difficult to obtain , with the best source of precise data being double - lined eclipsing binaries , but those systems are not only scarce but also intrinsically faint .",
    "therefore their detection is slightly difficult . as pointed out by coughlin and shaw ( 2007 ) only three low - mass double - lined eclipsing binary systems",
    "were known before 2003 : cmdra ( lacy,1977 and metcalfe et al .",

    "1999 , ribas 2003 ) . in the following five years",
    "the number of low - mass systems has tripled by many variability surveys : bw5v038 ( maceroni and montalban 2004 ) , tres - her 0 - 07621 ( creevey et al .",

    "thereafter , seven new low - mass eclipsing binaries were discovered by coughlin and shaw ( 2007 ) . very recently",
    "lopez - morales et al . ( 2006 ) discussed a plausible correlation between the magnetic activity levels , the metallicities and the radii of low mass stars which depends on the precise radii measurements of 34 low mass stars from the eclipsing binary systems .",
    "ribas and colleagues ( ribas et al . 2003 , morales et al .",
    "2008 ) have revealed that the low - mass stars are systematically larger and cooler than the predictions of theoretical calculations . however , there is no significant difference between the observed and theoretical luminosities of the low - mass stars .",
    "clearly , the sample size of well - studied low - mass binaries needs to be increased .",
    "since the number of well - studied low - mass binaries is still relatively small , observations of additional low mass binaries would be extremely useful .",
    "light variability of the star known as nsvs02502726 ( hereafter nsvs0250 ) was revealed by wozniak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from the northern sky variability survey .",
    "later on it has been discovered to be an eclipsing binary by coughlin & shaw ( 2007 ) .",
    "their preliminary study shows that nsvs0250 consists of two dissimilar low - mass stars with a join apperant visual magnitude of v@xmath8=13.41 and an orbital period of @xmath90.6 days . since spectroscopic observations are not available , they presented the photometric light curves and preliminary models based only on the light curve analysis .    in this work we present follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations of nsvs0250 which confirm the low - mass nature of the component stars .",
    "we derive accurate fundamental parameters for the component stars and compare our results with theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "we report here new photometry of nsvs0250 in the bessell @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "both the photometric accuracy ( a few millimagnitudes ) and the phase coverage ( over 1000 observations ) are sufficient to guarantee a reliable determination of the light curve parameters .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 0.40 m telescope between january and february of 2008 at the tbitak national observatory ( tug , located on mt .",

    "nsvs0250 is a relatively faint target , with not many other objects of similar spectral type or brightness nearby . by placing nsvs0250 very close to center of the ccd to get the highest accuracy",
    ", we managed to strategically locate the binary on the chip together with two other stars of similar apparent magnitudes .",
    "we selected gsc 3798 - 1250 as a comparison star , located 1@xmath11.479 away from the target .",

    "the data were analyzed using another iraf task phot without taking into account differential extinction effects due to the relatively small angular separation between the target , comparison and check stars on the sky .",

    "the first orbital period and zero epoch for nsvs0250 were determined from these observations .",
    "an orbital period of p=0.559772@xmath20.000007 days , and an initial epoch t@xmath13(hjd)=2453692.0280@xmath20.0003 for the mid - primary eclipse were calculated using a least square fit . to define the accurate period of nsvs0250 , we collected times of minima avaliable from the literature and added 8 times of mid - eclipse obtained in this study , including 4 primary and 4 secondary .",
    "accurate times for those mid - eclipses were computed by applying 6@xmath14 order polynominal fits to the data during eclipses .",
    "the times of mid - eclipse obtained by us are listed in table 1 .",
    "a linear least squares fit to the obtained so far yields an orbital period of p=0.559755@xmath20.000001 days , which is 1.5 s shorter than that estimated by coughlin & shaw ( 2007 ) . as the new reference epoch",

    "however , a more accurate determination of the mean absolute temperature of nsvs0250 s secondary is still necessary .",
    "note that the potentially large uncertainity in the adopted effective temperature of the primary and calculated for the secondary has no impact on the accuracy of the determined absolute dimensions .",
    "for example , tha radii of the stars , which are obtained from the light curve modelling , suffer in appreciable changes when t@xmath18 values moderate uncertainity about the mean one adopted .",
    "the luminosity and absolute bolometric magnitudes m@xmath19 of the stars in table 4 were computed from their effective temperatures and their radii . since low - mass stars radiates more energy at the loger wavelengths we used @xmath20 magnitudes given by coughlin & shaw ( 2007 ) . applying @xmath21 brightness - t@xmath18 relations given by kervella et al .",

    "nsvs0250 collected by us clearly indicated strong emission in h@xmath4 for both components above the continuum in some orbital phases .",

    "6 we show h@xmath4 emission features in some orbital phases together with their equivalent width variation ( bottom panel ) as a function orbital phase . we find a clear evidence of the h@xmath4-line equivalent width ( ew ) variation with the orbital phase , indicating direct emission with larger ew when the spotted areas are visible . such correlation between the ews of h@xmath4-line and orbital phase is known for chromospherically active rs cvn - type stars for a long time .",
    "our observations of nsvs0250 are well distributed in orbital phase and were obtained at a spectral resolution 0.9  .",
    "both components display h@xmath4 emission cores and the more massive component usually shows weaker emission .",
    "four spectra of nsvs0250 in the deblending of a double - peaked h@xmath4 region show emission core from both stars in any case for the comparable intensities of the components .",
    "the radial velocities of the components could be measured from the deblending h@xmath4 emission lines , near the orbital phases of 0.25 and 0.75 .",
    "these rvs are very close to those obtained from the absorption lines , indicating that the h@xmath4 emission lines are formed in a region close to the stars surface .",
    "the relevant result of the simultaneous photometric and h@xmath4 monitoring is that the less massive and cooler star appears also as the more active at a chromospheric level , since it has a larger h@xmath4-line s ews at this epoch .",

    "this comparison may easily be done by comparing location of a star in the log @xmath25 vs. log @xmath26 or mass - radius diagrams formed by theoretical predictions . as an example , fig .",
    "7 shows the locations of the primary and secondary stars on the theoretical hr diagram , i.e. log @xmath25 vs. log @xmath26 .",
    "the evolutionary tracks for the pre - main sequence stars with masses of 0.8 , 0.6 and 0.4 m@xmath27 taken from palla and stahler ( 1999 ) are also plotted for comparison .",
    "the location of the primary component in the log @xmath25 vs. log @xmath26 diagram is in agreement with theoretical prediction of a 0.7 m@xmath27 . using the solar metallicity models",
    ", we find a best - fit age for the primary star of @xmath2830 myr .",
    "the uncertainity of the age has been estimated from the errors in the effective temperature and surface gravity of the primary star .",
    "on contrary the secondary component seems to have an age of about 10 myr , indicating too young with respect to the primary star .",
    "this contradiction may be arisen from the very large radius , therefore smaller surface gravity , of the secondary component . on the other hand , when compared the locations of the components in the log @xmath25 vs. log @xmath29 diagram , while the primary component appears to be on the evolutionary track of a 0.7 m@xmath27 the secondary star is seen to be having higher luminosity , therefore younger .",
    "such tests of low - mass stellar models have been carried out by a number of authors in the past .",
    "torres & ribas ( 2002 ) and ribas ( 2003 ) have systematically pointed out a discrepancy between the stellar radii predicted by theory and the observations .",
    "model calculations appear to underestimate stellar radii by @xmath9 10 % , which is a highly significant difference given the observational uncertainities .",
    "recently , ribas et al . (",
    "2003 ) and morales et al .",
    "( 2008 ) made a comparison between the mass - radius and mass-@xmath25 relations predicted by models and the observational data for stars below 1 m@xmath27 from detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "they conclude that current stellar models predict radii for low - mass stars 10% smaller than measured .",
    "furthermore the computed effective temperatures are 5% larger , while the luminosities are in agreement .",
    "while the radius of the more massive component is in agreement with the stars with same masses , the secondary component seems to have 1.5 times larger with respect to its mass than predicted by the stellar theory for an age of the primary star ( see morales 2007 , figure 1 ) .",
    "this is the reason why the location of the secondary component does deviate from the predicted in the log @xmath25 vs. log @xmath26 diagram .",
    "morales et al .",
    "( 2008 ) indicate that chromospherically active stars are cooler and larger than the inactive stars of similar luminosity . even if the use of log @xmath25 vs. log @xmath29 diagram , the cooler temperatures will of course lead to infer younger ages even the log @xmath25 vs. log @xmath29 diagram is used .    the heliocentric space velocity components of nsvs0250 were computed from its position , radial velocity ( @xmath30 ) , distance ( @xmath22 ) , and proper motion .",
    "the latter were retrived from the @xmath31 catalogue ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "the resulting space velocity components are ( u , v , w ) ; u=-1.7@xmath20.2 , v=1.6@xmath20.3 , w=2.6@xmath20.1 , which correspond to a total space velocity of s=4.1@xmath20.9 . we can infer from those space velocities that nsvs0250 should not be an older star .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the system seems to have an age of about 126 myr .",
    "both components are in the final stages of the pre - main - sequence contraction .",
