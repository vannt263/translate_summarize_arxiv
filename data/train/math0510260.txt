    ", we introduce a similar construction when given a lagrangian submanifold @xmath1 in @xmath2 . instead of considering the loops in @xmath6",
    ", we consider the paths in @xmath6 starting at the identity and ending in the subgroup @xmath7 : @xmath8 another natural subgroup to consider consists of hamiltonian symplectomorphisms that fix @xmath1 pointwisely .",
    "it is easy to see that any diffeomorphism of @xmath1 that is isotopic to the identity can be extended to a hamiltonian symplectomorphism in @xmath9 that preserves @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that the two choices of subgroups essentially differ by @xmath10 . for",
    "the purpose of this paper , the reader can think of either choice .    under the monotonicity assumption in the lagrangian setting , one can define the seidel elements for the elements in a covering of @xmath11 .",

    "we should explain the above diagram a little more . the seidel maps are defined for the extensions @xmath17 of the respective @xmath18 s by the corresponding period groups @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "an element @xmath21 can be viewed canonically as an element in @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lagseidel : groupinclusion ] ) and the corresponding seidel elements are related by @xmath15 .",
    "the group @xmath23 is an extension of @xmath24 so that the top sequence is exact .",
    "on the other hand , we may adopt mcduff s point of view in @xcite where the seidel map is defined on @xmath18 s directly by choosing a prefered extension @xmath25 for each @xmath26 .",
    "then holds with the non - extended homotopy groups .",
    "one of the original motivations for studying these seidel elements and the above diagram was to obtain information on the third term in the exact sequence , namely @xmath27 .",
    "this is the most elementary question that one may ask about the subgroup @xmath7 of hamiltonian transformations leaving a given lagrangian submanifold invariant .",
    "if , say , one calls the elements in the image of @xmath28 the _ circular seidel elements _ in @xmath29 and the elements in the image of @xmath14 the _ semi - circular _ ones , then by the commutativity of the diagram , the latter ones contain the former ones .",
    "one could try to find semi - circular , but not circular , elements by computing explicitly the two seidel morphisms .",
    "this would imply that @xmath30 is not onto , and therefore @xmath27 is not trivial . of course ,",
    "if a given component of @xmath7 is made of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms whose restrictions to @xmath1 is not isotopic to the identity , it is obviously not the identity component . hence our construction is useful when components are made of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms whose restriction to @xmath1 is isotopic to the identity ( or can not be easily shown to be non - isotopic to the identity ) .    in presence of a real structure on @xmath9 ,",
    "i.e. of an anti - symplectic involution @xmath31 with fixed point set @xmath1 , one could replace everywhere @xmath7 by its subgroup @xmath32 of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of @xmath9 commuting with @xmath31 .",
    "obviously the corresponding diagram would still commute . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to a detailed setting of the theory , postponing to a forthcoming paper applications and computations of examples .    in section ",
    "[ lagfloer ] , we review lagrangian floer homology in the setting of hamiltonian paths , cf . @xcite .",
    "other versions of floer homology of a single lagrangian already exist , e.g. @xcite by oh , fukaya  oh  ohta  ono , biran  cornea .",
    "because we will be working over @xmath33 , we include a discussion of the coherent orientation for the floer trajectories , essentially following fukaya ",

    "ono @xcite .",
    "the necessary gluing is similar to those found in albers @xcite .",
    "the half - pair - of - pants product is analogous to the pair - of - pants product in the hamiltonian floer homology with some notorious differences ( say its non - commutativity ) .",
    "it should coincide with the product defined from holomorphic triangles as in @xcite or using the linear cluster complex as in @xcite . for later use",
    ", we also discuss the action of @xmath5 as well as the albers comparison map .",
    "other versions of the action of @xmath5 has been described before , e.g. in the context of the linear cluster complex ( or pearl complex ) @xcite or in the context of @xmath34-action on the @xmath35-algebra in @xcite .    in  [ lagseidel ]",
    "we carry out seidel s construction for @xmath16 and show that it has the expected properties .",
    "it is also in this section that we show the commutativity of diagram . finally ,",
    "for later use related to the computations in @xmath36 , we explain in  [ reversed : novikov ] and in  [ reversed : lagfloer ] the effect of reversing the orientations of the generators of the symplectic and lagrangian floer homologies a well as the reversal of time in operations on floer homologies .",
    "we would like to mention here that the possibility of defining a relative seidel morphism appears implicitly in the recent paper of rmi leclercq in @xcite . indeed",
    ", the proof of his basic proposition 3.1 that he needs to define his lagrangian spectral invariants , contains the main ingredients of the construction of a relative seidel morphism , even though it is not presented in these terms",
