    "the problem of species doublers in lattice fermion formulations is well known .",
    "the wilson quark action , commonly used in numerical simulations of lattice qcd , avoids this problem at the cost of explicit breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "this means that the conventional nambu - goldstone mechanism associated with spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry can not be invoked to predict the existence of massless pion for this quark action at a finite lattice spacing .",
    "it has been found , however , that massless pion does appear with the wilson quark action once the bare quark mass @xmath2 , or equivalently the hopping parameter @xmath3 , is tuned appropriately .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the pion mass vanishes along a line @xmath4 , called the critical line , which runs from @xmath5 in the strong - coupling limit @xmath6 to @xmath7 in the weak - coupling limit @xmath8 on the @xmath9 plane@xcite .",
    "one of us has suggested some years ago@xcite that the massless pion which appears for the wilson quark action may be understood as a zero mode of a second - order phase transition spontaneously breaking parity - flavor symmetry .",
    "it has also been argued that , while there are only two critical lines in the region of strong coupling , there exist ten critical lines in the weak - coupling region , paired into five branches which reach the weak - coupling limit @xmath8 at @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "some analytic@xcite and numerical@xcite results supporting this view have been previously reported .",
    "more recently arguments have been presented@xcite that the end points of five branches move away from the weak - coupling limit for finite temporal lattice sizes corresponding to finite temperatures , so that the critical lines form five cusps at some @xmath13 , above which no critical line exists .",
    "the existence of the second critical line paired with the conventional one and a formation of a cusp by the two critical lines have been confirmed numerically in a recent full qcd simulation at finite temperature@xcite .    in this brief report",
    "we present further investigation of the structure of critical lines for the wilson quark action using quenched qcd .",
    "one of the motivations of the present work is to find evidence for the existence of five pairs of critical lines toward weak coupling at zero temperature .",
    "we expect this structure to remain in the quenched approximation , in which case the structure should be computationally much easier to confirm than in full qcd . another motivation is to examine how the structure of critical lines changes for a finite temporal lattice size @xmath14 corresponding to finite temperature . in particular",
    "we wish to examine how the first - order deconfinement phase transition , which takes place at a fixed value @xmath15 independent of @xmath16 for quenched qcd , affects the critical lines .",
    "our expectation would be that massless pion , and hence also the critical lines , disappears in the high - temperature phase above the deconfinement transition @xmath17 .",
    "finding the location of critical lines throughout the @xmath9 plane requires a convenient indicator for their positions . for this purpose",
    "we employ the number of conjugate gradient iterations @xmath18 necessary to invert the wilson fermion matrix to a given value of the residual . for infinite volume this quantity increases toward critical lines and",
    "is expected to diverge in between a pair of critical lines , where parity is spontaneously broken , due to the presence of zero modes of the wilson fermion matrix . on a finite lattice where",
    "zero mode eigenvalues should be slightly shifted away from zero , we expect a peak in @xmath18 across each pair of critical lines .",
    "let us note that the phase structure on the @xmath9 plane should be symmetric under @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath20 we thus expect three peaks in @xmath18 as a function of @xmath16 toward weak coupling .",
    "we have carried out a measurement of the number @xmath18 for a set of values of @xmath20 at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath1 on a @xmath24 lattice , and at @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 on a @xmath28 lattice .",
    "results are obtained by an average over @xmath29 ( for @xmath24 ) or @xmath30 ( for @xmath28 ) configurations separated by @xmath31 sweeps of the pseudo - heatbath algorithm .",
    "the stopping condition is taken to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents a wall source of unit strength for all space - time sites and colors , and @xmath34 the lattice volume with @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "runs are made only for @xmath20 since the structure of critical lines should be symmetric under @xmath19 .",

    "the peak position shifts toward larger values of @xmath40 , albeit only slightly over the range @xmath41@xmath27 examined in the simulation .",
    "these results are consistent with the expected structure of multiple critical lines appearing at @xmath42@xmath1 .    in order to confirm that the peaks of @xmath18 observed at @xmath42@xmath1 correspond to five critical lines of massless pion",

    "the stopping condition for quark propagator calculation is taken to be @xmath47 with @xmath33 a point source at the origin .",
    "we should note that we have encountered ` exceptional ' configurations near the peaks of @xmath18 , on which the pion propagator takes a w shape as a function of time .",
    "since such exceptional configurations are never encountered in our full qcd simulations@xcite , we think that they are an artifact of the quenched approximation in which configurations with small fermionic eigenvalues are not suppressed contrary to full qcd .",
    "we have therefore excluded the exceptional configurations from our propagator average .",

    "we clearly observe that there exist four more critical values of vanishing pion mass in addition to the conventional one located at the right most of the figure .",
    "making a linear extrapolation of @xmath51 in @xmath52 using two or three data points , we find @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the five critical values from left to right .",
    "for a finite temporal lattice size @xmath14 corresponding to finite temperature , the critical line should be defined by vanishing of the pion screening mass extracted from the pion propagator for large spatial separations . in quenched qcd",
    "an interesting question is how the structure of critical lines changes across the deconfinement transition which takes place at @xmath15 independent of the hopping parameter @xmath16 of valence quark . in the confining phase @xmath58 ,",
    "it is natural to expect that the structure of critical lines remains qualitatively the same as at zero temperature except for a possible shift of their location by a magnitude depending on @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pion screening mass would not vanish in the deconfined phase @xmath17 , and hence critical lines would disappear . for values of @xmath16 close to the conventional critical value",
