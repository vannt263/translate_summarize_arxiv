    "the recent breakthroughs in the experimental physics of double quantum dot @xcite show that this proposal is especially promising .",
    "mathematically , a two - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 chain at finite temperatures can serve as an effective model of a double quantum dot .",

    "the entanglement associated with the thermal state @xmath7 is referred to as the thermal entanglement @xcite .    in a very important 1999 paper , ref.@xcite , gottesman and",
    "chuang showed that single qubit operations , bell - basis measurements and greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite are sufficient to construct a universal quantum computer .",

    ", @xmath139 is dependent on @xmath10 . to obtain @xmath139",
    "we consider the following .",
    "for the thermal state eq.(24 ) to be useful for quantum teleportation at nonzero @xmath1 , we demand that @xmath140    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + table 1 : critical temperatures @xmath84 and @xmath139 for various values of @xmath10 , when @xmath36 .",

    "1 ) . this is because eq.(41 ) is unattainable , consistent with the fact that the original two - qubit thermal states [ eq.(7 ) ] have fully entangled fraction less or equal to @xmath144 and thus can not yield nonclassical teleportation fidelity , when @xmath145 . from eq.(36 ) and a comparison of @xmath139 s with the corresponding @xmath84 s from ref.@xcite ( see table 1 ) , we conclude that the entanglement swapping process `` amplifies '' the thermal noise present in the original two - qubit states [ eq.(7 ) ] resulting in @xmath146 for each given @xmath10 .    for nonzero @xmath77 , eq.(40 )",
    "can be satisfied as long as @xmath63 or @xmath72 . at @xmath67 , it reduces to @xmath147 which is again unattainable .",
    "therefore , @xmath139 similarly decreases to zero when @xmath10 is increased from @xmath18 to @xmath76 , as shown in fig .",

    "the behavior of @xmath139 is therefore qualitatively similar to @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( compare fig . 4 in ref.@xcite and fig . 1 in ref.@xcite with our fig .",
    "hence , anisotropy allows one to obtain three - qubit ghz - like thermal states eq.(24 ) , which yield nonclassical teleportation fidelities at finitely higher temperatures by applying an external magnetic field of finitely greater strengths .",
    "this is somewhat surprising in view of the following two facts .",
    "first , even in the zero temperature limit , @xmath30 is far from `` ideal '' : eqs.(17 ) - ( 21 ) .",
    "second , from the above conclusion , one would naturally expect these imperfections to be amplified .",
    "in summary , we have shown that despite the fact our entanglement swapping procedure amplifies thermal noise , anisotropy in the original heisenberg @xmath0 chains enables the resulting three - qubit ghz - like mixed state to yield nonclassical teleportation fidelities at finitely higher and higher temperatures by suitably increasing the strengths of an external magnetic field . in the light of the result of gottesman and chuang @xcite",
    ", our result has therefore a positive implication on the quantum - dot realization of a quantum computer .",
    "however , we should point out that although nonclassical , the teleportation fidelities are very close to @xmath135 , as can easily be deduced from eq.(39 ) .",
    "hence , one immediate research problem would be to look at models like those considered by anteneodo _",
    "_ @xcite and zhou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to see if this situation could be improved .",
    "next , multi - qubit ghz states would be necessary in any realistic setting . to produce these states",
    "would require more `` complicated '' ghz basis measurements .",
    "therefore , another interesting research problem would be to study how the noise amplification scales with the complexity of these measurements .",
