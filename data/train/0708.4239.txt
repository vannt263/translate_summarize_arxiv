    "the hf - o system has been considered as one of the most important systems in various industrial fields , such as nuclear materials and high temperature / pressure materials .",
    "hafnium dioxide is known as the least volatile of all the oxides and its high melting point , extreme chemical inertness , and high thermal neutron capture cross section make it suitable for use as control rods or neutron shielding .",
    "all of these reasons can make hfo@xmath3 a promising refractory material for future nuclear applications@xcite .",
    "recently , the hf - o system has even attracted considerable attention for semi - conductor materials . the current gate oxide material ( sio@xmath3",
    "in general ) thickness in advanced complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) integrated circuits has continuously decreased and has reached the current process limit@xcite .",
    "one solution to further improve their performance is to use alternative materials with higher dielectric constants ( _ k _ ) , such as zro@xmath3 and hfo@xmath3@xcite . in this",
    "regard , thermodynamic stability calculations results showed that the interface between hfo@xmath3 and si is found to be stable with respect to the formation of silicides whereas the zro@xmath3/si interface is not@xcite .",
    "the stability of the hfo@xmath3/si interface make the use of this oxide even more promising .",
    "the other important group iva transition metals , such as ti and zr , which show very similar behavior as hf , with oxygen are modeled recently by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "all these systems commonly have a wide oxygen solubility ranges in the hcp phase , up to 33 at.%(ti - o ) , 29 at.%(zr - o ) , and 20 at.%(hf - o ) at room temperature , as derived from higher temperature measurements .    in the present work",
    ", the hf - o system has been modeled with the existing experimental data and first - principles calculations results .",
    "afterwards , combining with the thermodynamic parameters of the hf - si and the si - o binary systems , the thermodynamic description of the hf - si - o ternary system is obtained , and the stability diagrams pertinent to thin film processing , such as the hfo@xmath3-sio@xmath3 pseudo - binary , the isopleth of hfo@xmath3-si , and isothermal sections are calculated .",
    "many investigations have been conducted to clarify the phase diagram of the hf - o system@xcite .",
    "the main issues regarding the phase diagram of the hf - o system include : the extent of the @xmath0-hf solid solution , the congruent melting of hfo@xmath3 , and the allotropic transformations of hfo@xmath3 .",
    "the phase diagrams suggested by @xcite and @xcite are quite similar to each other , except the formation of the @xmath1-hf phase and the eutectic reaction around 37 at.% oxygen of liquid . for the hafnium rich - side , @xcite proposed a eutectic reaction at 2273k , while @xcite suggested a peritectic reaction around 2523k .",
    "similar to other group iva transition metals , such as ti , and zr , it is strongly believed that hf also has a peritectic reaction at the hf - rich side .",
    "another minor disagreement between these two phase diagram determinations is the eutectic reaction , liquid @xmath4 @xmath0 + hfo@xmath3 .",
    "rudy and stecher suggested composition of oxygen in the liquid as 40 at.% o and 2453@xmath540k , while domgala and ruh proposed 37 at.% o and @xmath62473k .    for the @xmath0-hf solid solution ,",
    "these two works@xcite are in quite good agreement with each other .",
    "rudy and stecher found that @xmath0-hf dissolves up to 20.5 at.% oxygen at 1623k and that the solubility range is almost independent of temperature ; this shows consistency with observations by domagala and ruh and they quoted a solubility of oxygen in @xmath0-hf of 18.6 at.% at 1273k .",
    "@xcite proposed a tentative phase diagram for the @xmath7-rich portion of the hf - hfo@xmath3 system on the basis of metallographic data .",
    "they suggested the existence of solid solution regions for both cubic and tetragonal phases deviated from the stoichiometric composition of hfo@xmath3 .",
    "since the important phases in the hf - o system are the polymorphs of the @xmath7 phases , i.e. monoclinic , tetragonal , and cubic , they have been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "allotropic transformations of the hfo@xmath3 phase have been well summarized by @xcite .",
    "the suggested phase diagram of the hf - o system by @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfom ] .",
    "not many studies have been conducted regarding the phase stabilities of the hf - si - o ternary system .",
    "@xcite reported a ternary compound , hafnon , with the chemical formula of hfsio@xmath2 and the crystal structure as @xmath8 .",
    "one of the most important phase diagrams of the hf - si - o system is the hfo@xmath3-sio@xmath3 pseudo - binary that includes hfsio@xmath2 since the phase stabilities of this pseudo - binary are pertinent to the processing of the dielectric thin film .",
    "@xcite determined the melting of hfsio@xmath2 at 2023@xmath515k .      as discussed in the introduction",
    ", the hf - o system has a wide range of oxygen solubility in the hcp phase .",
    "_ studied order / disorder transformation of interstitial oxygen in hafnium@xcite around 10 @xmath6 20at.% by electron microscopy and neutron and x - ray diffractions .",
    "this work revealed that two types of interstitial superstructures are formed in the hypo- and hyper - stoichiometric compositions near @xmath9 below 700k which have @xmath10 and @xmath11 symmetries , respectively .",
    "for the completely disordered hcp phase at high temperature , @xcite measured the partial molar enthalpy of solution of oxygen in @xmath0-hf solid solution at 1323k as a function of oxygen content using a tian - calvet - type microcalorimeter .",
    "previously , it was almost impossible to measure the extremely low oxygen pressure in equilibrium with hafnium - oxygen solutions",
    ". therefore derivation from the second law of thermodynamics was the only way to acquire thermodynamic information of solid solution phases@xcite .",
    "the major difficulty of direct measurement is making sure that all the hafnium surface is accessible at the same time to oxygen .",
    "boureau and gerdanian improved the accuracy of measurement by solving the geometrical effect of specimen and oxygen contact .",
    "the observed phase boundary of @xmath0-hf in this work is consistent with that of previous phase diagram studies@xcite as o / hf=0.255 .",
    "the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite was used to perform the density functional theory ( dft ) electronic structure calculations .",
    "the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite was chosen and the general gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite was used to take into account exchange and correlation contributions to the hamiltonian of the ion - electron system .",
    "an energy cutoff of 500 ev was used to calculate the electronic structures of all the compounds .",
    "5,000 _ k_-points per reciprocal atom based on the monkhorst - pack scheme for the brillouin - zone sampling was used .",
    "the @xmath12-point meshes were centered at the @xmath13 point for the hcp calculations .",
    "the ordered structures of the hf - si - o system calculated in this work can be categorized into three groups .",
    "first , pure elements , i.e. hcp hafnium and diamond silicon are calculated for the reference states .",
    "second , hypothetical compounds , the end - members of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 solid solutions ( hfo@xmath14 and hfo@xmath15 ) , are also calculated .",
    "the stable compounds , monoclinic hfo@xmath3 , quartz sio@xmath3 , and the ternary compounds , hfsio@xmath2 are calculated as well . the calculated results of the ordered structures are listed in table [ tbl : abinitio ] .",
    "the enthalpy of those compounds are calculated from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hfsio ] :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 corresponds to the enthalpies of the compound and reference structures .",
    "the reference states for hf and si were the hcp and diamond structures , respectively . in the case of condensed phases , the effects of lattice vibrations and other degrees of freedom ( i.e. electronic , magnetic ) can be neglected at low temperatures . moreover , due to their rather small molar volumes , the @xmath18 contributions to their enthalpies ( @xmath19 ) can also be neglected .",
    "thus their enthalpies @xmath17 , can be replaced by the calculated first - principles total energies at 0k in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hfsio ] . for the oxygen gas ,",
    "the selected reference state was diatomic oxygen , o@xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the contributions due to vibrational and translational degrees of freedom , as well as the @xmath18 work term , the molar volume of o@xmath3 is much larger than that of the condensed phases and can not be neglected . in the following section , the determination of the correct reference state for o@xmath3 will be briefly discussed .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the complete thermodynamic description of the hf - si - o ternary system is developed via the hybrid approach of first - principles calculations and calphad modeling in the present work . in the hf - o system ,",
    "special quasirandom structures have been generated to calculate the enthalpies of mixing of oxygen and vacancies in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 solid solutions .",
    "calculated enthalpies of mixing of @xmath0-hf are almost identical to the model - calculated value whereas those of @xmath1-hf show significant discrepancy . in the @xmath1 phase",
    ", first - principles calculations could not retain its original symmetry as bcc due to the strong interaction between the atoms in the structure .",
    "the calculated enthalpies of mixing from sqs s results are combined with the enthalpies of formations of those hypothetical compounds calculated from the electronic structure calculations to derive the gibbs energy of solid solutions in the hf - o system .    in the total energy calculation of oxygen gas ,",
    "vibrational , rotational and translational degrees of freedom are considered . with the adjusted total energy of oxygen molecule ,",
    "the enthalpies of formation from first - principles calculations for both ordered and disordered phases showed good agreement with evaluated values .",
    "the hf - o system has been combined with the hf - si and the si - o systems to calculate the hf - si - o ternary system with the ternary compound hfsio@xmath2 introduced from the first - principles calculations . from the hf - si - o thermodynamic database ,",
    "phase stabilities pertinent to thin film processing such as hfo@xmath3-sio@xmath3 pseudo - binary , isothermal sections , and isopleth have been calculated .",
    "the thermodynamic calculation results show that the hfo@xmath3/si interface is stable above 543.53k , which agrees with previous experimental results .",
    "however , due to the uncertainty of hfsio@xmath2 formation energy from first - principles , the stability of hfsi@xmath3 in the hfo@xmath3/si interface is still in question and further experimental investigation is required .    it can be concluded that the thermodynamic properties of solid phases can be obtained from first - principles calculations not only for the ordered structures but also for the solution phases as long as one can find appropriate geometrical input for phases of interest .",
    "special quasirandom structures for a substitutional solution phase is one example .",
    "however , one should notice that such a supercell only mimics short - ranged interaction as in metallic alloy systems . as shown in the present work",
    ", sqs s can successfully describe the mixing behavior between oxygen and vacancies in the @xmath0 solid solution where oxygen concentrations are relatively low , but for the oxygen - rich @xmath1 phase such interactions between the electrons at the longer distance become important and lead to the collapse of its original structure as bcc when the structure has been fully relaxed .",
