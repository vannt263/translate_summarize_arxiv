    "understanding the inner workings of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is important for understanding the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution .",
    "the mid - to - far infrared ( mfir ) is a key wavelength regime for testing the agn unified scheme and probing the nature of the nuclear obscuring medium .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ allows studies to be made at higher sensitivity and spatial resolution that previous ir missions .",
    "we are conducting a large observing program with all three _ spitzer _ instruments to determine the mfir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of 87 seyfert galaxies ( pi : j. gallimore , pid : 3269 ) . the sample of seyfert galaxies used for this study comprises all seyfert galaxies from the extended 12  sample of @xcite that have @xmath0  kms@xmath1 . here",
    "we discuss the 51 objects in the sample for which the low - resolution , 5  35  irs spectra are currently available .",
    "the analysis of these spectra and a more detailed discussion of the results are presented in @xcite .",
    "we find four distinct types of continuum shapes and spectral features among the irs spectra of the seyfert nuclei .",
    "figure [ fig : egspec ] shows typical spectra in each group .",
    "we group the spectra according to the following main properties : + @xmath2 twenty - four objects ( 47%  of the observed objects ) have spectra dominated by strong pah emission features and very red continuum suggestive of cool dust ; mrk938 is the archetype .",
    "many ( 16 ) of these objects show clear or weak silicate absorption at 10  .",
    "+ @xmath2 sixteen objects ( 31% ) have continua that can be described by a broken power - law ; they show a flattening in the continuum slope at @xmath320  ; ngc4151 is the brightest of this class .",
    "this flattening may be due to a warm ( @xmath3170  k ) dust component , peaking at @xmath320  , dominating the mid - ir emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however , a simple model of an emissivity - weighted blackbody function does not fit the continuum of these spectra well .",
    "two of these objects , mrk6 and mrk335 , show clear silicate emission features .",
    "a further 9 objects in this group , including ngc4151 , show weak excesses at 10 and 18  that may be due to silicate emission .",
    "+ @xmath2 eight objects ( 16% ) have power - law continuous spectra .",
    "ngc  3516 is representative of this class .",
    "these spectra show no strong dust emission or absorption features , though most have weak excesses at 10 and 18  that may be due to silicate emission .",
    "+ @xmath2 two objects ( ngc1194 & f04385@xmath40828 ) show a broad absorption feature at 9.7  due to silicate dust .",
    "+ one object ( ngc7603 ) appears to show both pah and silicate emission features and otherwise fails to meet any of the above classifications .",
    "the spectral shapes may be quantitatively characterized by the ir colors , or spectral indices , derived from the spectra .",
    "the spectral index between 20 and 30  quantifies the slope of the spectrum ( above the @xmath320  ` break ' for broken power - law spectra ) , while the spectral index between 8 and 10  indicates the presence or absence of the 9.7  silicate feature and pah features .",
    "the resulting color - color diagrams are given in figure [ fig : cols ] .",
    "one sy 2 ( ngc3079 ) with extreme colors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , is not shown .",
    "the sy 1 s ( seyfert types 1.0 , 1.2 and 1.5 ) lie in the lower - right part of the diagram , occupied by unbroken and broken power - law spectra , specifically avoiding the region of the reddest pah emitters .",
    "sy 2 s are found in both regions .",
    "earlier type seyferts ( i.e. 1  1.5 ) have the bluest colors , while seyfert 2 s with hidden broad line regions ( hblrs ; type 2h ) span the range of colors .",
    "the fact that sy 1 s consistently show the bluest infrared colors and the sy 2 s are the reddest sources indicates the ir spectra are changing systematically with seyfert type .",
    "we performed a principal component analysis ( pca ) on the spectra to determine the component spectral shapes ( eigenvectors ) producing the variety of spectra seen in the sample ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the first eigenvector is the most dominant and contributes 91% of the variance in the spectra .",
    "we find that the relative contribution of eigenvector 1 to each spectrum relates strongly to the shape of the sed , as the different shapes have significantly different contributions from this eigenvector ( figure [ fig : evonehist ] ) .",
    "the similarity in the features between the red objects like mrk  938 and the ir spectra of starburst galaxies such as m  82 strongly suggests these objects are dominated by the starburst contribution to the dust heating at mid - infrared wavelengths ( figure [ fig : sbfigs ] ) .",
    "we find a significant difference between the contribution of the first eigenvector to the spectra of the sy 1 s and sy 2 s ( figure [ fig : evonesy ] ) .",
    "our results confirm the previous findings of @xcite and @xcite , based on ground - based photometry , that sy 2 s show more star formation than sy 1 s .",
    "we present the results of spitzer irs nuclear spectra for the first 51 of a complete sample of 12  selected seyfert galaxies .",
    "we find the following main conclusions : + @xmath2 the spectra clearly divide into groups based on their continuum shapes and spectral features .",
    "the largest group ( 47% of the sample of 51 ) shows very red continuum suggestive of cool dust and strong emission features attributed to pahs .",
    "sixteen objects ( 31% ) are well described by a broken power - law continuum .",
    "a further 16% of the sample show power - law continua with unchanging slopes .",
    "two objects are dominated by a broad silicate absorption feature .",
    "one object in the sample shows an unusual spectrum dominated by emission features , that is unlike any of the other spectra .",
    "some features are clearly related to the starburst contribution to the ir spectrum , while the mechanisms producing the power - law continuum attributed to the agn component are not yet clear .",
    "the ir seds are related to the seyfert types but the precise correspondence between the ir types and the optical spectral types is unclear .",
    "+ @xmath2 principal component analysis suggests that the relative contribution of starburst - heated dust emission to the sed is the dominant cause of variance in the observed spectra .",
    "+ @xmath2 we find that the sy 2 s typically show stronger starburst contributions in their ir spectra than the sy 1 s , confirming previous results found using photometric data .",
    "+ detailed modeling of the continuum emission is underway to separate in detail the starburst and agn contributions to the ir spectrum in order to place constraints on the opacity and geometry of the nuclear obscuring material , and to compare the relative starburst contributions of seyfert types 1 and 2 .",
